    "an important step in understanding the binding properties of nuclear matter was made with relativistic approaches to nuclear interactions .",
    "they were capable to resolve to a large extent the longstanding problem of the underestimation of the binding energy of nuclear matter found in non - relativistic calculations .",
    "conceptually , the relativistic theory provides a very natural link to modern boson exchange interactions and - at least in principle - relates in - medium interactions to free space nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering .",
    "applications have mostly been concentrating on the description of symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "although being different in theoretical and numerical details the various approaches are in rather close agreement on the bulk properties of nuclear matter .",
    "investigations of asymmetric nuclear matter , however , are rare , most of them of a very recent date @xcite .",
    "one reason is certainly that up to very recent years the data base on asymmetric systems was rather limited because stable nuclei range around @xmath1 with a rather small bandwidth of variations .",
    "asymmetric matter was mainly of theoretical interest , except for astrophysical studies , as the structure of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the situation has changed completely with the new radioactive beam facilities producing now new isotopes in a sufficiently large amount for detailed studies .",
    "the isospin degree of freedom in the nuclear equation of state can be investigated for the first time over a much larger range of proton - neutron asymmetries as before . at present , the largest asymmetries produced",
    "experimentally are obtained for light dripline nuclei ( @xmath2 for the heavy isotopes of he to oxygen nuclides ) which is about a factor of 2 less of the asymmetries found in stable nuclei . in the near future an increasing amount of data for nuclides all over the mass table can be expected .",
    "it is obvious that the properties of asymmetric matter are of high interest for nuclear structure at the proton and neutron driplines and _ vice versa_. the isospin dependence of the nuclear equation of state is to a large extent unexplored .",
    "extrapolations of the nuclear mass formula into the regions of new isotopes persistently result in strong deviations from measured binding energies .",
    "the same is found for structure calculations with seemingly well established effective interaction models as the non - relativistic skyrme energy functional . although the parameters of skyrme interactions are derived empirically and the various model interactions reproduce the properties of stable nuclei very well the predictions for nuclei far off stability",
    "are found to differ drastically .",
    "similar observation are also made for relativistic mean - field theories .",
    "thus , the question arises to what extent the asymmetry , i.e. isospin dependent contributions to the bethe - weiszcker mass formula are really understood .",
    "it is apparent that systematic studies of asymmetric matter are required . in this work",
    "we describe asymmetric nuclear matter in the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) approach .",
    "compared to symmetric matter the theoretical and numerical efforts , respectively , are much larger because protons and neutrons are occupying different fermi spheres .",
    "this implies different effective masses for protons and neutrons and the two sorts of particles cover a different range of off - shell momenta .",
    "hence , it can be expected that beside the isospin also the momentum dependence of self - energies will be of importance .",
    "as noted before , asymmetric matter requires to solve a system of coupled equations for the set @xmath3 of in - medium proton - neutron t - matrices , where @xmath4 denote a proton or neutron , respectively .",
    "we perform our calculation in a plane - wave spinor basis in which we have neutrons and protons as distinguishable particles .",
    "this implies that we also take into account partial - wave amplitudes that are zero in symmetric nuclear and neutron matter , where the masses are equal and isospin is a good quantum number .",
    "it is not clear whether other calculations take these amplitudes into account .",
    "details of the theoretical formulation are discussed in sect .",
    "2 .    a central point of",
    "the discussion is the derivation of a new asymmetry dependent invariant .",
    "traditionally , the positive energy - projected in - medium on - shell t - matrix is expressed in terms of five lorentz invariant amplitudes ( see eq.(2.7 ) ) .",
    "this standard set of invariants is known to be not unique because each can be replaced by its derivative counterpart .",
    "a well known example is the ambiguity found by changing from the pseudo - scalar to the pseudo - vector @xmath5 coupling .",
    "a proper treatment avoiding such ambiguities is to solve the in - medium scattering problem for the full dirac - space including also negative energy states .",
    "such an approach was applied by huber et al .",
    "@xcite using the so - called @xmath6-approximation . in our approach",
    "we continue to use the projected t - matrix . to do",
    "so we need to introduce a sixth invariant since in asymmetric matter there are six independent helicity amplitudes . clearly , the new invariant must be defined such that the description of _ symmetric _ matter is conserved .",
    "a promising guideline is to consider an amplitude which approaches zero for equal proton and neutron effective masses .",
    "such an amplitude will vanish in symmetric matter and thus fulfills the constraint mentioned above . in order to account for the differences in @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "one actually has to define separate invariant amplitudes for the direct and the exchange channel . in the direct channel a vector - scalar and in the exchange channel a pseudovector - pseudoscalar combination",
    "is required .",
    "however , only the direct amplitude contributes to the proton / neutron self - energies .",
    "results for the equation of state for nuclear matter at various degrees of asymmetry are discussed in sect .",
    "3 . particular emphasis is put on the momentum structure of self - energies .",
    "we define effective isoscalar and isovector self - energies which directly characterize the mean - field of asymmetric nuclear matter . the dependence of the equation of state on the isovector density is tested and compared to the prediction of the mass formula of being quadratic .",
    "the paper closes in sect .",
    "4 with a summary and conclusions .",
    "the implementation of the rbhf model we use is identical to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , an account of a calculation for asymmetric nuclear matter can be found in ref .",
    "we will only briefly review the concepts of the relativistic brueckner model , but will elaborate further on an omission in the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the central quantity in the model is the self - energy , in the rbhf model it has a structure in the spinor representation , expressed by scalar and vector components : @xmath9 inserting this form of the self - energy into the dirac equation , it is natural to define effective quantities by @xmath10 this can be simplified further by dividing out the ( small ) @xmath11 term @xcite : @xmath12 .",
    "one thus finds a solution of the dressed dirac equation ; the effective spinor : @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "the self - energy is found to depend only weakly on the momentum at least inside the fermi - sphere : in the practical calculation it is taken constant and set to the value at the fermi - surface .",
    "this greatly simplifies the calculations .",
    "obviously in asymmetric nuclear matter the fermi - momenta of protons and neutrons are different , leading to different pauli - blocking operators and corresponding neutron and the proton self - energies .",
    "this asymmetry is also reflected in the fact that one has three different effective interactions , represented by three different @xmath15-matrices : @xmath16 ( proton - proton scattering ) , @xmath17 ( proton - neutron scattering ) and @xmath18 ( neutron - neutron scattering ) . in the brueckner scheme",
    "these are calculated by : @xmath19 note the coupled channels for @xmath20 , we also stress that @xmath21 is _ not _ related by a fierz - transform to @xmath21 : in @xmath21 we have neutron - proton vertices on which only the isospin-1 mesons contribute .",
    "it immediately follows that the same holds for the @xmath15-matrices : @xmath7 is not related to @xmath8 .",
    "the 2-body propagators @xmath22 are the usual ones as they appear in the three - dimensionally reduced thompson equation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angle averaged pauli blocker of the intermediate momentum @xmath25 , a function of the total momentum @xmath26 and invariant mass @xmath27 , its parameters depend on the appropriate fermi - momenta @xmath28 . after obtaining a solution for the @xmath15-matrices",
    ", the self - energy is then calculated using a brueckner - type expression : @xmath29 +   \\int tr \\left [ t^{a}_{np } g_p \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 stands for @xmath31 . for the proton self - energy",
    "the expression is completely similar .",
    "we will specify these expressions further later on .",
    "for the moment we note that the integrations extend over the neutron and proton fermi sea , respectively .",
    "this calculation is repeated until a self - consistent solution for the self - energy is found . with the self - consistent self - energy one",
    "then can calculate quantities like binding energy and single - particle energies .    in our implementation of the relativistic brueckner model we calculate the self - energy by decomposing the various @xmath15-matrices in lorentz invariant amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this boils down to transforming the spin - representation to spinor - representation .",
    "the contributions of the various amplitudes to the components of the self - energy are then easily found . in the case of identical particles",
    "( to be more precise , particles with equal mass ) , five amplitudes are needed for the decomposition of the on - shell @xmath15-matrix .",
    "we use a set of invariants including the pseudo - vector coupling . in the c.m .",
    "system we then have : @xmath32 \\left[\\bar{u}^*(-\\bar{p } ' ) f_i u^*(-\\bar{p } ) \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ f_i & \\in & \\ { 1 , \\gamma^\\mu , \\sigma^{\\mu \\nu } , \\gamma^5\\gamma^\\mu ,   \\frac{\\mbox{$\\not \\ ! q$ } \\gamma^5}{2 m^ * } \\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 the transferred momentum : @xmath34 . for the on - shell scattering matrix elements we have in the c.m .",
    "frame @xmath35 and @xmath36 . to calculate the self - energy one needs the amplitudes for the direct ( @xmath37 ) and exchange ( @xmath38 )",
    "seperately . at these points",
    "the set of invariants is degenerate , this is solved by decomposing at small angles and extrapolating to @xmath39 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that this limit exists .",
    "it has often been noted this particular set of invariants is not unique .",
    "one can always replace an invariant with its derivative counterpart , we did this by using the pseudo - vector invariant instead of the pseudo - scalar invariant .",
    "in this specific case one finds the same coefficient @xmath40 since the @xmath15-matrix is on - shell , but the contribution to the self - energy is different .",
    "however , the contribution to the total energy ( found by sandwiching the self - energy between effective spinors ) is the same for a given @xmath15-matrix . in a self - consistent calculation",
    "there will be a difference due to the fact that the self - consistent self - energy will be different , and thus the @xmath15-matrix is different .",
    "one guideline to limit the freedom in the choice of invariants is to require that one uses the same vertices in the invariant amplitudes as appear in the obe interaction .",
    "since we have a pseudo - vector coupling for the pion , we thus also have to use the pseudo - vector invariant in the projection .    to avoid this ambiguity one has to calculate the scattering in the complete dirac space , as is done e.g. in ref .",
    "for the unique decomposition one needs @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in our calculation",
    "we only have the amplitude between positive energy spinors ( the mean - field generated by the self - energy ) .",
    "two different decompositions of the self - energy @xmath45 need to give the same value for the mean - field : @xmath46 .",
    "one can easily check that up to @xmath47 this implies for the components @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the ` ambiguity ' coefficient @xmath51 will of course depend on density and momentum . inserting this in the expression for the renormalized effective mass",
    "we see that this is shifted by a quantity much smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "typically , an error of 100 mev leads to a shift of @xmath52 mev in the renormalized effective mass . from the above",
    "it follows that any approximate method for the decomposition of the self - energy will still give fair results for quantities that involve only the mean - field , like the binding energy .    in the case of particles having different masses , the helicity matrix elements cease to be symmetric under exchange of particles .",
    "since the number of invariants needed to decompose the @xmath15-matrix is equal to the number of independent helicity matrix elements after exhausting all the symmetries , the loss of this symmetry implies that one needs additional invariants to decompose the @xmath15-matrix .",
    "appearantly this was not considered in ref .",
    "for the on - shell @xmath53 @xmath15-matrix , needed for the calculation of the self - energy , six invariants are required .",
    "although it is relatively easy to find additional invariants that span the six - dimensional space of the six independent helicity matrix elements , the problem is that we need to have a decomposition that reduces to the one used in the symmetric case . with this",
    "we mean that the coefficient of the additional , sixth , amplitude should approach zero in the limit of equal masses .",
    "obviously this is not a trivial requirement .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath8 are different we can choose invariants for the exchange and direct amplitudes independently .",
    "we encountered a similar situation for the @xmath54 scattering matrix @xcite .",
    "for the present case we found the following invariants which satisfy the above criterium : @xmath55 \\left[\\bar{u}^*_p(-\\bar{p } ' ) u^*_p(-\\bar{p } ) \\right ] + \\left[\\bar{u}^*_n(\\bar{p } ' ) u^*_n(\\bar{p } ) \\right ] \\left[\\bar{u}^*_p(-\\bar{p } ' ) \\mbox{$\\not \\ !",

    "the numerical indices are the particle numbers ( 1 and 2 are incoming , 3 and 4 outgoing ) , the indices @xmath58 denote a neutron and a proton spinor respectively .",
    "the amplitude in the exchange channel is antisymmetric under exchange of particles , even when the masses are equal ( the other invariants are symmetric under exchange of particles ) .",
    "this does not mean that it is not a valid invariant , but it results in a vanishing coefficient for equal masses , which is exactly what we required .",
    "we were unable to find an invariant with this property for the direct channel , but the one given above does have a vanishing coefficient for equal masses . in both invariants",
    "the momentum @xmath59 appears .",
    "this makes it impossible to interpret them as some sort of meson channel since a meson carries a momentum @xmath60 . to us",
    "there is no straightforward interpretation of these invariants beyond that they are needed to project out the @xmath15-matrix in the @xmath53 channel .",
    "this @xmath15-matrix spans up a six - dimensional space in spin - space , and we therefore need a six - dimensional basis in spinor space for the basis transformation from spin to spinor representation .",
    "we want to stress again that it is crucial for the description of _ symmetric _ nuclear matter that for asymmetric nuclear matter we have a set of six invariants that behaves properly in the limit of symmetric nuclear matter ( equal proton and neutron masses ) .",
    "if we could not find such a set , the method of extracting self - energies in symmetric nuclear matter by means of invariant amplitudes would have an additional ambiguity since the self - energies would not be a continuous function of the asymmetry parameter .    inserting the decomposition in the expression for the self - energies we find : @xmath61 \\gamma^i_{dir , nn } - f^i ( \\not\\!q^ * + m^*_n ) f^i \\gamma^i_{exch , nn } \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & + &   \\int_0^{p_{f , p } } \\frac{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\frac{1}{2e^*_{q , p } } \\sum_i \\left\\ { f^i tr [ ( \\not\\!q^ * + m^*_p ) f^i ] \\gamma^i_{dir , np } - f^i ( \\not\\!q^ * + m^*_p ) f^i \\gamma^i_{exch , np } \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] working out the dirac algebra , we find the components of the self - energy expressed in terms of the various @xmath62 .",

    "the coefficient @xmath77 does not appear in the expressions for the self - energy : for @xmath78 , @xmath79 and since the extrapolated @xmath77 is finite ( we checked this by renormalizing the invariant by dividing by @xmath80 ) it does not contribute to the self - energy .",
    "in fig . [ figure_eb ] we present the results for the equation of state for various values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath81 using the groningen potential @xcite . following ref .",
    "@xcite we used an averaged fermi momentum defined by : @xmath82 in the calculation it turns out that the contribution of the sixth invariant is negligible , although it of course indirectly affects the results by influencing the values of the other coefficients .",
    "overall the results look pretty much like the ones presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in a way this is not surprising because the results for @xmath83 ( nuclear matter ) and @xmath84 ( neutron matter ) are unaffected by the sixth invariant .",
    "the binding energy curves for intermediate values of @xmath81 will lie between these two extreme curves , which does not provide a large freedom . a more quantitative measure of the equation of state is the asymmetry - energy coefficient @xmath85 , multiplying the @xmath86 term in the semi - empirical mass - formula .",
    "as has been argued in @xcite one should use the binding energies at the various saturation points in the determination of this coefficient and we determine @xmath85 by @xmath87 using this prescription we find for the groningen potential @xmath88 mev .",
    "recalculating it for the bonn c potential @xcite we find a sightly larger value of 28 mev . in the literature",
    "one finds a rather wide range of phenomenological values .",
    "older ones tend to give lower values , e.g. in @xcite a value of @xmath89 mev is given , a more recent liquid drop model calculation cites a result in the range 27 - 30 mev while a very recent work comes up with @xmath90 mev @xcite .",
    "our result also shows that extracting the asymmetry coefficient via fitting self - energies only for symmetric nuclear and neutron matter , as is done e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , gives much too large results .",
    "these authors find values of 35 mev and higher .",
    "we also note that although for the binding energy we find a nice quadratic dependence on the asymmetry parameter , this is not the case for the other quantities like effective masses and self - energies ( taken at the respective fermi - momenta ) .",
    "there we find a dependence which is more linear in character .    in studying the momentum dependence of the self - energies it is convenient to define isoscalar and isovector quantities . for a given observable @xmath91 we set @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ figure_mf ] we show the isoscalar and isovector mean - field as a function of the relative momentum @xmath93 , calculated at the respective saturation densities for each asymmetry parameter . as in refs .",
    "@xcite we define the mean - field as the shift in the pole of the nucleon propagator due to the medium correlations .",
    "we see that up to an asymmetry parameter of 0.3 the isovector mean - field is rather independent of @xmath81 .",
    "there are some minor differences , but the slope is essentially the same . only at @xmath94",
    "we find a deviation , this might be due to the fact that we calculate the mean - field at the saturation density , which is different in this case .",
    "the isovector mean - field shows more structure .",
    "we observe the intuitively expected increasing difference with increasing asymmetry ( corresponding to a lower value of @xmath81 ) . however , there is no quadratic dependence on the density a significant dependence on the momentum is found for high momenta , while inside the fermi - seaa smooth behaviour is obtained .",
    "we show a similar analysis for the isovector components of the scalar and vector self - energy .",
    "the isovector scalar and vector self - energies can be interpreted as a ` effective ' @xmath0-meson and @xmath95-meson strengths .",
    "again we see a notable momentum dependence , similar to the one observed in the isovector mean - field .",
    "it is also interesting to analyze our results in terms of mean - field effective coupling constants .",
    "this is particulary useful in calculations of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "as in the analysis above , we have four channels , both a scalar and vector in either the isoscalar and isovector channel . for this analysis",
    "we ignore the momentum dependence and calculate the self - energy of both the neutron and proton at the average fermi - momentum as defined in eq .",
    "[ fermi_mom ] .",
    "the effective coupling constants are then defined by : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the usual scalar and vector densities from relativistic mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ figure_eff_g ] .",
    "as one intuitively expects , the scalar and vector isoscalar channels carry the largest strength .",
    "the dependence on the asymmetry parameter is small but we do observe a strong dependence on the density .",
    "for the densities presented in the figure , which range from half to double normal nuclear matter density , the dependence is predominantly linear in the fermi momentum except for the isovector scalar channel .",
    "there , a significant dependence on higher orders in @xmath63 and the asymmetry is found .",
    "this is in agreement with the finding of boersma and malfliet for their density dependent parametrization of the g - matrix .",
    "they strongly favour a density dependence of the coupling constants linear in @xmath63 as well @xcite , over other possibilities like the exponential dependence of marcos _ et al .",
    "the strength in the isovector channels is smaller although equal in both the scalar and vector channel .",
    "the significant scalar strength in the isovector channel suggests that for fits using only a limited number of meson , like the one of ref .",
    "@xcite one certainly needs to include a @xmath0-meson as well . for densities corresponding to @xmath99",
    "gev / c we again find negligible dependence on the asymmetry parameter and a linear dependence on the fermi momentum .",
    "we find a positive sign for @xmath100 , which is not the case when one uses the momentum dependence of the single - particle energy to extract the scalar and vector self - energy components @xcite .",
    "note that since our decomposition of the self - energy is not unique the same holds for this analysis in terms of effective coupling constants .",
    "however , we think our approximate method still will be able to indicate trends .",
    "still , both the neutron and proton self - energy will have an ` error ' @xmath101 .",
    "if these are very different due to e.g. a strong dependence on the momentum , one can obtain spurious results in the isovector channels as the negative sign of @xmath100 indicates when using the momentum dependence method .",
    "below @xmath102 gev / c the density dependence changes and an enhancement of the isovector couplings is found at large asymmetry .",
    "most probably this is related to the appearance of bound states related to pairing , which typically appear at low densities in a brueckner approach . in that sense",
    "the brueckner scheme is an intermediate - density approximation , losing its physical significance at low densities . at low densities",
    "the brueckner independent - pair assumption ceases to be valid because of the onset of the pairing instability and the approach of the deuteron bound - state pole in the @xmath53-channel . for @xmath94",
    "the proton density is already very low , and one starts to see the onset of pairing correlations .",
    "a similar behaviour can be observed in the density dependent parametrization of the former results of ref .",

    "also the density dependent db isoscalar scalar and vector coupling constants of ref.@xcite are shown which in @xcite were found to describe nuclear properties very well . in the isoscalar channels",
    "the two db sets are in rather good agreement and both calculations reproduce almost perfectly the purely phenomenological rmt coupling constants .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the isoscalar channel the effective coupling constants at saturation density are remarkably close to the ` bare ' values as they appear in the interaction .",
    "this means , that around these densities the higher order effects generated by the brueckner ladder are small .",
    "we therefore should find only small dependencies on e.g. the asymmetry , which we do observe . in the isovector channel",

    "<S> it is shown that for asymmetric nuclear matter one needs a sixth invariant . </S>",
    "<S> we present a set of invariants which in the limit of symmetric nuclear matter reduces to the conventional set . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the existence of such a properly behaving set is also crucial for the application of the projection method in symmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> results for the equation of state and other observables are presented . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is payed to an analysis in terms of mean - field effective coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the usual ones we also find significant strength in the isovector scalar channel , which can be interpreted as an effective @xmath0-meson . </S>"
