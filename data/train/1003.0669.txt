    "experimental studies of neutrino oscillations have provided us with compelling evidence that neutrinos have masses and lepton flavors mix . among various theoretical models ,",
    "the famous seesaw mechanism @xcite provides us with a very natural description of why the masses of the three known neutrinos are so small compared to the masses of the other standard model ( sm ) fermions . in the simplest type - i seesaw model , heavy right - handed neutrinos with a mass scale @xmath0",
    "are introduced in addition to the sm particle content . in order to stabilize the masses of the light neutrinos around the sub - ev scale ,",
    "@xmath1 is naturally expected , if the dirac mass @xmath2 between the left- and right - handed neutrinos is comparable with the mass of the top quark .",
    "the testability of conventional seesaw models is therefore questionable .",
    "furthermore , the heavy right - handed neutrinos potentially contribute to the hierarchy problem through loop corrections to the higgs potential , unless a supersymmetric framework is considered .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will soon start to probe tev scale physics , and the question of whether we can find hints on the neutrino mass generation mechanism at the lhc or not is relevant and interesting .",
    "there are several indications that new physics will show up at the tev scale , in particular theories that are able to stabilize the higgs mass and to solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the geometric mean of the planck mass and the @xmath3 k background temperature also suggests that 1 tev is the maximum mass that any cosmologically stable perturbatively coupled elementary particle can have , otherwise the density of the universe exceeds its critical value @xcite . within the seesaw framework , for the purpose of lowering the seesaw scale without spoiling the naturalness criterion ,",
    "some underlying symmetry preserving the lepton number , @xmath4 , is usually incorporated .",
    "for example , in the type - i seesaw with more than one heavy right - handed neutrino , contributions to the light - neutrino masses from different right - handed neutrinos may cancel each other due to the symmetry , which results in massless left - handed neutrinos after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom from the theory @xcite .",
    "such a low - scale fermionic seesaw mechanism may not be able to stabilize the masses of the light neutrinos , since loop corrections may be unacceptably large . a possible way to avoid this problem of the type - i seesaw model",
    "is given by the inverse seesaw model , which contains a majorana insertion used to reduce the @xmath5 scale @xcite .",
    "in the type - ii seesaw model , extending the sm with an @xmath6 triplet higgs scalar @xcite , the coupling between the triplet and the sm higgs scalar breaks lepton number explicitly and is expected to be very small .",
    "thus , the masses of the light neutrinos are suppressed through the approximate symmetry . in general , the canonical leptogenesis mechanism @xcite , which provides a very attractive description of the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , does not work for the low - scale seesaw mechanisms unless severe fine - tuning is invoked @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the alternative framework of extra spacetime dimensions , where the fundamental grand unified scale and the planck scale are lowered in a natural way @xcite .",
    "we work exclusively within the context of flat extra dimensions . in our higher - dimensional seesaw model ,",
    "a truncating scale restoring the renormalizability of the theory plays the role of breaking @xmath5 , so that the masses of the light neutrinos are suppressed , while the lower kaluza  klein ( kk ) states can be searched for at the lhc .",
    "significant low - energy non - unitary leptonic mixing , due to integrating out the heavy kk states , could give observable phenomena in future neutrino oscillation experiments , such as a neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "in addition , resonant leptogenesis could possibly be achieved in this model . for earlier studies of the generation of small neutrino masses in the context of extra dimensions ,",

    "we consider a brane world theory with a five - dimensional bulk , where the sm particles are confined to the brane .",
    "we also introduce three sm singlet fermions @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "being singlets , they are not restricted to the brane and can propagate in the extra spacetime dimensions .",
    "the action responsible for the neutrino masses is given by @xmath9 \\nonumber \\\\ &   & + \\int_{y=0 } { \\rm d}^4 x \\left ( - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_s } } \\overline{\\nu_{\\rm l } } \\hat m^c \\psi - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m_s } } \\overline{\\nu^c_{\\rm l } } \\hat m \\psi + { \\rm h.c.}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the coordinate along the extra compactified dimension and @xmath11 denotes the mass scale of the higher - dimensional theory .",
    "note that , although @xmath12 is defined in the same way as in four dimensions , it does not represent the charge conjugate of @xmath13 in five dimensions @xcite , and hence , the term @xmath14 is not a majorana mass term .",
    "however , in the four - dimensional theory , it leads to effective majorana mass terms for the kk modes of @xmath13 . due to the freedom in the choice of basis for the singlet fermion fields ,",
    "one can always apply a unitary transformation in flavor space in order to diagonalize @xmath0 . without loss of generality",
    ", we will therefore work in a basis in which @xmath15 is real and diagonal .",
    "the dirac masses @xmath16 and @xmath17 could be generated by couplings of the bulk neutrinos to a brane - localized higgs boson receiving a vacuum expectation value .",
    "we decompose the spinors of the bulk singlet fermions into two two - component objects : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "since the extra dimension is compactified on the @xmath20 orbifold , the kk modes of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are four - dimensional weyl spinors .",
    "we take @xmath21 to be even under the @xmath23 transformation @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is taken to be odd .",
    "thus , in eq .  , the @xmath17 term corresponding to the coupling between @xmath26 and @xmath25 is not allowed .",
    "the kk expansions of @xmath21 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath27 in general , an extra - dimensional model must be viewed as an effective theory , since it is non - renormalizable .",
    "this means that the kk towers are expected not to be infinite , but truncated after a finite number of levels .",
    "the nature of this cutoff depends on the specific ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of the model , which is not known . here",
    ", we impose a truncation of the kk towers at a maximum kk index @xmath28 .",
    "a cutoff of this kind arises , for example , in deconstructed models of extra dimensions @xcite . in general , other kinds of truncation schemes",
    "are possible , but the one that we consider has the virtue of giving rise to a mechanism for generating small neutrino masses from the tops of the kk towers , as will be discussed below .    inserting the above expansion into eq .   and integrating over the compactified extra dimension , we arrive at the following form for the four - dimensional action @xmath29 \\right .",

    "for the purpose of simplicity in the following discussion , we define the linear combinations @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "the full mass matrix in the basis @xmath36 then reads @xmath37 the scale of @xmath0 is not governed by the electroweak symmetry breaking , and hence , one can expect that @xmath38 holds . then , by approximately solving the eigenvalue equation of the matrix in eq .   with respect to the small ratio @xmath39 , the light - neutrino mass matrix is found to be @xmath40    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the limit @xmath41 is considered , and the light - neutrino mass matrix is then given by @xmath42 the masses of the light neutrinos are suppressed only if @xmath43 in the denominator of eq .",
    "is very large .",
    "therefore , a severe fine - tuning between @xmath44 and @xmath45 has to be invoked , which appears quite unnatural .",
    "however , bare majorana masses of the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is an odd integer , emerge naturally from the sherk  schwarz decomposition in string theory as a requirement of topological constraints , and hence , such relations do not suffer any fine - tuning problems ( see detailed discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . with our chosen cutoff scheme , together with the above condition on @xmath48 , lepton number violation will be induced only at the top of the kk tower , as we will see shortly .",
    "there could , of course , be other lepton number violating processes at some intermediate point , but we choose to treat the simple scenario where the cutoff is the only source .",
    "one can easily prove that , in the simplest case @xmath49 , the light - neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath50 instead of a large mass scale @xmath0 for the singlet fermions , the light - neutrino masses are suppressed by the large cutoff scale @xmath51 .",
    "we consider the interesting case where the scale of the uv completion is much larger than the scale of the extra dimension @xmath52 and the singlet fermion masses , _ i.e. _ , we assume @xmath53 to hold . in this limit , the neutrino mass matrix is simply given by @xmath54 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the scale of the neutrino masses is determined by a high - energy scale associated with the fundamental theory underlying the effective extra - dimensional model . as for the heavy kk modes , from eq .",
    ", the masses of the @xmath31th excited kk modes are given by @xmath55 as we will discuss later , this implies that @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) form dirac pairs .",
    "thus , lepton number can be assigned to these pairs and the lepton number violating effects , such as neutrino masses , can only arise from the unpaired @xmath60 at the top of the kk tower .",
    "in order to compute the effective low - energy leptonic mixing , we first consider the light - neutrino mass matrix . generally , @xmath61 is a complex symmetric matrix , and can be diagonalized by means of a unitary matrix @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , with @xmath65 being the masses of the light neutrinos .",
    "note that , similarly to the ordinary fermionic seesaw mechanism , the light neutrinos mix with the heavy kk modes .",
    "thus , @xmath62 is not the exact leptonic mixing matrix entering into neutrino oscillations , even if one works in a basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal . to see this point clearly",
    ", we can fully diagonalize eq .   and then write down the neutrino flavor eigenstates in terms of the mass eigenstates @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 denotes the mass eigenstates of the light neutrinos , and @xmath68 is the upper - left @xmath69 sub - matrix of the complete mixing matrix containing the light neutrinos as well as the full kk tower for the singlet fermions .",
    "furthermore , we have introduced the quantities @xmath70 which represent the mixing between the light neutrinos and the kk modes .",
    "the charged - current lagrangian in mass basis can be rewritten as @xmath71w^-_\\mu + { \\rm h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the @xmath6 coupling constant .",
    "due to the existence of the kk modes , the light - neutrino mixing matrix is no longer unitary . to a very good precision , we have @xmath73 assuming that @xmath74 , eq",
    ".   can be approximated by @xmath75 compared to the conventional parametrization of non - unitarity effects @xmath76 @xcite , where @xmath77 is a hermitian matrix , we thus obtain @xmath78 an interesting feature of eq",
    ".   arises immediately : the non - unitarity effects are dominated only by the combination @xmath79 . as a rough estimate ,",
    "if we keep @xmath52 at the tev scale and @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be naturally expected .",
    "another typical feature is that , if @xmath82 holds , then both the neutrino mixing and the non - unitarity effects are determined by a single dirac mass matrix @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , in such a realistic low - scale extra - dimensional model , the non - unitarity effects are strongly correlated with the neutrino mixing matrix and the radius of the extra spacetime dimension .    in our numerical computations ,",
    "we adopt a convenient parametrization @xcite , and rewrite @xmath2 as @xmath83 with @xmath84 being an arbitrary complex orthogonal matrix . with this parametrization , eq",
    ".   takes the form @xmath85    the present bounds at 90  % c.l . on the non - unitarity parameters are given by @xcite @xmath86 where the most severe constraint is that on the @xmath87 element , coming from the @xmath88 decay .",
    "however , in the case that @xmath0 lies below the electroweak scale , but above a few gev , the @xmath88 constraint is lost due to the restoration of the glashow ",
    "iliopoulos  maiani ( gim ) mechanism @xcite , and a less stringent bound of @xmath89 should be used .",
    "apart from resulting in non - unitarity effects in neutrino mixing , the heavy singlet fermions in the bulk will also contribute to the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays of charged leptons , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath88 and @xmath90 , through the loop exchange of kk modes @xcite .",
    "different from the standard type - i seesaw mechanism , the corresponding branching ratios are not dramatically suppressed by the light - neutrino masses , but only driven down by the factor @xmath91 defined in eq .  .",
    "thus , appreciable lfv rates could be obtained .",
    "as shown in eq .  , the heavy singlets @xmath59 , @xmath56 , and @xmath92 couple to the gauge sector of the sm , and thus , if kinematically accessible , they could be produced at hadron colliders . for a quantitative discussion ,",
    "we now restrict ourselves to the simplest case @xmath93 .",
    "note that @xmath59 and @xmath58 are two - component majorana fields with equal masses but opposite cp parities @xcite .",
    "thus , they are equivalent to a single dirac field @xmath94 with @xmath95 $ ] , @xmath96 $ ] , and mass @xmath97 . similarly , @xmath98 can be combined with @xmath99 , and hence , forms a higher kk dirac mode with @xmath100 $ ] and mass @xmath101 . as a general result of the mass degeneracy , all the kk modes are paired together except for the highest mode @xmath60 with mass @xmath102 .",
