    "numerous ways to control the orientation of ordered meso - phases have been extensively studied in recent years . as an example , we mention that lamellar block copolymers ( bcp ) confined between two flat and parallel surfaces have been shown to orient parallel or perpendicular to the surfaces , depending on the surface separation @xcite . furthermore , chemically patterned surface can induce perpendicular or even tilted lamellae , if the chemical interaction is strong enough @xcite .",
    "applying shear is yet another effective method in producing large well - aligned samples @xcite , but this method is difficult to implement in thin films .",
    "another related situation can be found in liquid - crystals , where surface anchoring determines the direction of adjacent molecules and affects the bulk orientation and possible defects @xcite .",
    "this type of surface effect has been studied extensively in relation to the fredericksz transition and in twisted nematic liquid - crystal displays .",
    "electric field can be very useful in aligning samples in which a large dielectric or conductivity contrast exists between the components @xcite .",
    "however , the use of electric field requires rather sophisticated experimental setups in order to avoid adverse effects of ion accumulation at electrodes , short - circuits due to dust particles , etc . @xcite .",
    "most of the studies mentioned above are restricted to films in contact with flat and smooth solid surfaces .",
    "little attention has been paid to the role of surface roughness on film morphology and orientation , although it is clear that non - flat surface topography gives rise to defects ( e.g. vacancies in the lamellar ordering ) and affects the lamellae orientation .",
    "quite recently , experiments carried out by hashimoto and co - workers on lamellar bcp films @xcite addressed the question of how surface roughness affects bcp film orientation . in their study",
    "it was shown that the degree of surface roughness controls the lamellar orientation , leading to situations where the bcp films orient themselves parallel or perpendicular to the surface .",
    "these experiments serve as a starting point of our theoretical investigation , where we restrict ourselves to lamellar multilayer systems in contact with one corrugated surface .",
    "the model is expressed in terms of the elastic energy of lamellar or smectic systems , and is described by only two elastic constants .",
    "hence , although some system - specific details are missing , the results are not restricted to bcp films , but are more general and equally apply to a broad class of systems ranging from smectic liquid - crystals to lyotropic ( oil / water / amphiphile ) systems .",
    "the main difference between these systems is in the values of the system parameters : the lamellar periodicity , strength of surface interaction and elastic constants .",
    "the elastic deformation energy of lamellar layers is studied separately for parallel and perpendicular orientations .",
    "it is shown that depending on the surface corrugation amplitude and periodicity , phase transitions can occur between the two orientations .",
    "since real surfaces are never ideally flat , understanding and characterizing surface roughness can be of great importance in controlling orientation of lamellar phases .",
    "this orientation mechanism is complementary to the mechanisms mentioned above of electric fields , shear and chemical surface patterning . in sections [ perp_sec ] and [ para_sec ]",
    "we calculate the deviations of lamellae from their corresponding flat perpendicular and parallel states .",
    "the free energy of the parallel and perpendicular states are compared in sec .",
    "[ diag_sec ] , and a general discussion and comparison with previous works follows in sec . [ discussion ] .",
    "consider a lamellar system confined by one topographically corrugated surface , as depicted in fig .  1 . instead of considering a rough surface having a random and quenched topography , we assume that the surface is characterized by a typical corrugation with a single amplitude and wavelength . the difference between a true rough surface and a corrugated one",
    "is not expected to be very significant as long as the rough surface amplitude and wavelengths do not vary much about their average values .",
    "a further simplification is that the surface height @xmath1 ( measured along the @xmath2-direction ) is taken to depend only on the lateral @xmath3 direction , while it is translational invariant in the @xmath4 direction : @xmath5        where the average @xmath6 is taken hereafter to be zero , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the corrugation amplitude and @xmath9 is the surface lateral periodicity .",
    "so far we described the quenched corrugated surface geometry .",
    "next we consider the energetics and structure of a lamellar phase in contact with such a surface .",
    "we start by examining the order - parameter corresponding to lamellae which are perpendicular to the average surface position : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the amplitude of lamellar concentration variations , @xmath12 is the bulk lamellar spacing , and @xmath13 is a slowly - varying phase describing the deviation from flat lamellae , perpendicular to the surface and given by @xmath14 .    the total free ",

    "it can be shown that for a slowly varying phase @xmath13 , an expansion of the free energy @xmath18 to quadratic order in @xmath19 and its spatial derivatives , can be written in complete analogy with smectic phases of liquid crystals as : @xmath20 { \\rm d}v~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation the integral is over the entire volume , @xmath21 is the compression modulus and @xmath22 is the bending modulus . in bcp systems the model holds well in intermediate and strong segregations , where the two copolymer blocks are well separated in different domains and the chains",

    "not the entire shown phase diagram is within the range of validity discussed above , eq . ( [ validity ] ) . for small values of @xmath95 ,",
    "the perpendicular layering is favored , because of the long - ranged elastic strain pertaining in parallel lamellae as compared to perpendicular ones .",
    "as @xmath95 increases , the strain in the parallel state becomes more restricted to the vicinity of the surface , until , eventually , the parallel state becomes more stable . at this transition point , the energetic gain of having a commensurate layer close to the surface overcomes the loss of elastic energy deformation",

    "@xmath115 and other parameters are the same as in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "figure 5 is a phase diagram in the @xmath116 plane , with @xmath95 kept fixed . for a given bcp chain length ( fixed @xmath52 ) , increase of @xmath8 will also increase the elastic energy of deforming parallel lamellae , and promotes perpendicular layering .",
    "on the other hand , keeping @xmath8 fixed and decreasing @xmath52 ( so that it becomes comparable to @xmath95 ) decreases the range of parallel deformation ; thus , favoring the parallel state .",
    "lamellar stacks of either liquid crystals ( smectics ) , short chains amphiphiles or long - chain bcp undergo deformation as they try to adjust to the presence of a rough ( corrugated ) surface . the amplitude and spatial extent of inplane and out - of - plane deformations are different and the preference for parallel or perpendicular orientations depends on specific bulk and surface parameters . which morphology prevails depends on the surface periodicity @xmath117 , surface amplitude @xmath8 , lamellar periodicity @xmath118 , as well as the surface field strength @xmath39 .",
    "for lamellae oriented perpendicular to the surface we use a model that indicates how the stack deformation propagates from the surface into the semi - infinite bulk .",

    "small surface corrugation is assumed such that we can use the limits : @xmath119 , @xmath65 .",
    "our study is complementary to a numerical study by podariu and chakrabarti @xcite who studied in detail extremely thin films ( thickness comparable or smaller than the lamellar thickness ) of a lamellar stack .    the system behavior in terms of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath95 is given in the phase diagram of fig .",

    "increase in the surface amplitude @xmath8 leads to preference of perpendicular lamellae . on the other hand , keeping @xmath8",
    "fixed and increasing @xmath95 leads to preference of parallel lamellae .",
    "this is a consequence of the diminished decay length of surface - induced undulations .",
    "when the undulations of parallel lamellae are restricted to the surface vicinity , the energy penalty of the elastic defect can be small .",
    "thus , the phase transition between these two states is described by a line in the two - dimensional phase diagram .",
    "quite generally , as the surface interaction parameter @xmath39 is increased , this line moves towards the @xmath8 axis in such a way that the state of parallel lamellae occupies a larger region in the phase diagram .",
    "the transition from parallel to perpendicular orientation as function of @xmath8 and @xmath52 is given in fig .",
    "increase of @xmath8 deforms the parallel layers and generally promotes perpendicular ordering . on the other hand , increase of @xmath52",
    "while keeping @xmath8 and @xmath95 fixed , implies a reduced range of parallel deformations and yield a preference for parallel lamellae .",
    "rough surface can be used to obtain morphologies that are usually controlled by chemical means : not only the transition between parallel and perpendicular lamellae , but also tilted lamellar morphologies . indeed ,",
    "in the limit of very small lamellar periodicity ( large @xmath52 ) and strong interfacial interactions @xmath39 , lamellae will appear locally perpendicular to the surface , and therefore tilt when the surface is not horizontal .",
    "similar tilted lamellae have been predicted for a bcp melt confined by chemically patterned surfaces @xcite , as the system tries to match the lamellae with the stripes .",
    "the present work is motivated by and is of direct relevance to recent experiments of hashimoto and co - workers on ps / pmma symmetric di - bcp on rough surfaces @xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "perpendicular orientation was observed for system parameters estimated to be @xmath120 nm@xmath121 , @xmath122 nm@xmath121 and @xmath123 nm . this set of data is in complete accord with the scaling formula , eq .",

    "( [ scaling ] ) yields here a small positive number , implying weak preference for perpendicular layers .",
    "the phase diagram also show marginal behavior , possibly preferential for perpendicular layers .",
    "this discrepancy can have several ( yet unknown ) origins .",
    "first , the exact value of the surface interaction parameter @xmath39 is not known from experiments , and it may be different than the values chosen by us in figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "furthermore , we employed several approximations in our calculations ignoring , for example , possible vacancies in the perpendicular lamellae and the temperature dependence of the elastic modulii .",
    "we also assumed that the system is semi - infinite in the @xmath2-direction , while in experiments the bcp film thickness is finite .",
    "it may be that the bcp / air free surface can induce islands or other types of surface - induced defects that alter the simple picture employed by us .",
    "the free  energy model holds for bcps in intermediate and strong segregations , but is less adequate for weaker segregations , as is possibly the case in the experiments .",
    "lastly , our theory can be improved by taking into account more realistic surface roughness , instead of a single surface @xmath0-mode .",
    "we hope that additional and detailed experiments of lamellar systems in contact with well characterized rough surfaces will shed more light on this problem , and will further motivate theoretical studies of these intriguing systems .",
