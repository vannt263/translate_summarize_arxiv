    "in many neutrino systems that are currently studied the rate of incoherent interactions is low enough to be completely negligible , yet _",
    "coherent _ interactions ( refraction ) play an important , even crucial role .",
    "a classical example is provided by the case of solar neutrinos : these neutrinos hardly scatter inside the sun ; nevertheless , their coherent interactions with the solar matter plays an essential role in their flavor evolution .",
    "this is of course the celebrated msw theory of neutrino oscillations in matter @xcite .",
    "the classical msw theory describes neutrino propagation in a background of normal matter ( electrons , neutrons , protons ) .",
    "there are systems , however , where the number density of neutrinos themselves exceeds those of electrons and baryons , such as the early universe , or the so - called hot bubble region in an exploding supernova .",
    "such systems additionally require a theory describing neutrino self - refraction .",
    "early investigations treated the neutrino background analogously to the msw theory @xcite .",
    "pantaleone @xcite , mckellar and thomson @xcite , and sigl and raffelt @xcite showed , however , that the neutrino background is distinguished by an important subtlety : the induced mass terms in general have nonzero off - diagonal components in the flavor basis . physically , this means that flavor can be _ coherently _ exchanged between the neutrinos .",
    "the authors of @xcite constructed the equation of motion of the neutrino system by using a one - body description for each neutrino .",
    "this treatment crucially depends on the assumption that the state of the system can be factorized into a product of one - particle states .",
    "if this is not the case and the wavefunctions of individual neutrinos are entangled , a very different treatment may be required .",
    "_ a priori _ , it is not obvious that neutrinos would not develop such entanglement , due to the off - diagonal induced mass terms .",
    "so the question arises whether this entanglement exists and has a substantial impact on the coherent flavor evolution of the neutrino ensemble .",
    "the answer could have a significant impact on the predictions for the supernova neutrino signal , the synthesis of heavy elements in the supernova , and possibly big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmology .",
    "the question was recently examined by friedland & lunardini ( f&l i , f&l ii ) and by bell , rawlinson and sawyer ( brs @xcite ) .",
    "all three papers used a similar setup , with a hamiltonian that was restricted to `` forward scattering '' only @xcite .",
    "while f&l i argued that _ the coherent part _ of the neutrino evolution should be described by the one - particle formalism , the brs paper reached an opposite conclusion .    to make their argument , brs considered the evolution of a system initially in the flavor eigenstates . with this choice",
    ", the one - particle formalism predicts no coherent flavor conversion and thus conversion on the coherent time scale in this system would be an indication of the breakdown of the one - particle description ( presumably through the formation of many - neutrino entangled states ) .",
    "the numerical calculation performed by brs seemed to suggest the presence of such `` fast '' conversions , although the calculations involved a relatively small numbers of neutrinos .",
    "f&l ii subsequently solved the neutrino model introduced by brs analytically for the special case of equal numbers of each neutrino species and equal strength interactions by mapping neutrino - neutrino interactions to spin - spin interactions .",
    "the solution in the limit of many particles exhibited the equilibration time that is precisely what would be expected from incoherent scattering .",
    "the analytical solution thus supported the one - particle description of the system .",
    "one may wonder , however , if the initial state considered in f&l ii , namely , equal numbers of spins `` up '' and `` down '' was somehow special .",
    "could entanglement appears with a more general setup ?    in this paper we will present a generalization of the many - body neutrino model introduced in f&l ii , in the hope of understanding the quantum system better .",
    "we again consider a system of many neutrinos in which there are two flavor species , so that it maps to a system of interacting spins ( thanks to the @xmath0 symmetry of the problem ) .",
    "we generalize the model to initial states in which the species are not equally populated and where the initial states are not necessarily in flavor eigenstates .",
    "we show that the corresponding spin problem can still be solved exactly .",
    "the resulting solution exhibits a rich set of behaviors , as will be discussed in the following .",
    "even generalized in this way , the model still involves several simplifications and it is important to spell these out .    *",
    "the model keeps only forward scattering terms .",
    "thus , while the model should correctly capture coherent effects in a real neutrino system , conclusions about incoherent scattering effects in our model must be interpreted with care . * the momentum degrees of freedom",
    "are ignored .",
    "the effects of fermi statistics are not included , that is the physical neutrino system is assumed to have a phase - space density much less than one .",
    "this is indeed satisfied everywhere outside the neutrinosphere in a supernova .",
    "the case of the neutrinos in the early universe may be more subtle .. this means that while the neutrinos on the tail @xmath1 are non - degenerate , those with @xmath2 are mildly degenerate . in the later regime",
    ", the present approximation may be inadequate .",
    "of course , if the chemical potential is significant , the phase space density will be of order one in some regions .",
    "] * the interaction strength between any two neutrinos is taken to be the same , ignoring the angular distribution of the neutrino momenta ( see later ) .",
    "the model thus aims to describe the physical situation in an isotropic neutrino gas and hence may or may not capture all effects that could arise as a result of very anisotropic momentum distributions , such as those suggested in @xcite .",
    "these limitations and assumptions should be kept in mind when relating the results obtained for the spin system to the behavior of a real neutrino gas .",
    "the problem of the flavor evolution in dense neutrino systems continues to receive a significant amount of attention .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned papers , the reader is referred to @xcite for recent progress .",
    "we follow @xcite and by considering a system consisting of interacting massless neutrinos represented by plane waves in a box of volume @xmath3 .",
    "since our primary motivation is to investigate coherent effects in the neutrino system , in particular , the possible breakdown of the one - body approximation due to flavor exchange , and not due to spatially dependent many - body correlations , we focus on the `` forward '' neutral current interactions between the neutrinos . in other words",
    ", we drop the momentum degrees of freedom and include only scattering events that preserve neutrino momenta and those that _ exchange _ the momenta , @xmath4    in the  usual \"",
    "case of electrons , protons and neutrons in the background , the waves scattered forward interfere coherently . for the neutrino background , however , this is not necessarily so and our model , in addition to coherent effects , captures some of the incoherent effects as well .",
    "the identification of coherent and incoherent effects will be discussed at length in what follows .",
    "for @xmath5 the neutral current interaction hamiltonian is    @xmath6    here the sum is over all @xmath7 flavors .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under a flavor @xmath8 symmetry .",
    "let us consider only two neutrino species , in which case the symmetry becomes @xmath0 and the flavor space structure of the @xmath9 interaction becomes equivalent to the interaction between pairs of spins . as explicitly shown in f&l ii , the interaction energy of two neutrinos , 1 and 2 , is proportional to the square of the total angular momentum of the corresponding spin system , @xmath10    the coefficient of proportionality dependents on the relative angle between the neutrino momenta @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xcite . in a realistic neutrino system ,",
    "the couplings are distributed according to the distribution of the relative angles between neutrino momenta . in order to make our system solvable",
    ", we will simplify the problem and take all the couplings to be the same @xmath13 it is hoped that this simplification preserves the essential features of the evolution ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "henceforth we study this system of interacting spins to obtain information about the neutrino system .",
    "we will consider a system of @xmath14 spins , such that initially @xmath15 spins all have a certain orientation ( for definiteness , without a loss of generality ,  up \" ) and the remaining @xmath16 spins all have a certain different orientation . at @xmath17 ,",

    "the decay exponent is a quantum effect , in a sense that its physical origin lies in the quantum uncertainty principle .",
    "this allows us to make an important identification : coherent evolution in the neutrino system maps into the classical behavior of the angular momenta , while incoherent effects in the neutrino system correspond to quantum effects in the spin system .",
    "this important point will be developed further in sect .",
    "[ sec : freeze - out ] .    finally , we note that the solution is periodic and the wavetrain , having seemingly completely decayed away , reemerges after some time .",
    "this phenomenon is due to the fact that the spin system possesses a fundamental frequency , of which all other frequencies ( the arguments of the cosines in eq .",

    "we have plotted the probability according to these equations for various numbers of spin down ( @xmath16 ) and spin up ( @xmath15 ) particles and a subset of these is shown in fig .",

    "this behavior is similar to what was observed in the case of sect .",
    "( [ sec : superposition_bg ] ) . just like that system , the wavetrain reemerges after some time . * as seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : n2560 plot ] , the equilibration happens on time scales characteristic of incoherent evolution , @xmath176 . unlike the case of sect .",
    "( [ sec : superposition_bg ] ) though , in the present case for @xmath51 we do not see coherent oscillations with the decaying wavetrain .",
    "in fact , it was explicitly shown in f&l ii that for @xmath51 the probability @xmath177 depends on time only through the combination @xmath178 .",
    "thus , the evolution has manifestly incoherent nature .",
    "( _ cf _ eq .",
    "( [ eq : coh_analyt ] ) ) . * as @xmath179 is increased , the value of @xmath177 in equilibrium , @xmath175 , increases and for large @xmath179 the system stops evolving , entering a  freeze - out \" state . this trend can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2560 plot ] . as further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : average probability ] , where @xmath175 is plotted as a function of @xmath180 for fixed @xmath181 , the minimum value of @xmath182 occurs when @xmath51 .",
    "that @xmath175 rises _ for both signs _ of @xmath183 appears counterintuitive at first .",
    "indeed , it means if we have a single spin up coupled to a very large system of spins down , the first spin does not equilibrate to a state mostly oriented down , but remains aligned up . * as @xmath179 is increased , in addition to decay , the system start exhibiting oscillations , the frequency of which grows with @xmath179 .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations gets progressively smaller as @xmath184 increases , since the system approaches the freeze - out state .",

    "we will then discuss the time scale of the evolution and whether the system follows the predictions of the one - particle hamiltonian in the classical regime .",
    "finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : period ] we will comment on the periodicity of our solution .      in the course of the analysis in sect .  [ sec : superposition_bg ] , we have encountered a situation in which fast coherent processes in the neutrino system corresponded to classical effects in the spin system , while slower incoherent processes in the neutrino system corresponded to quantum effects in the spin system .",
    "this physical picture is further illustrated by the system @xmath19 , @xmath187 we are now considering .",
    "once again , we recall that this system is reduced to two angular momenta as described in sect .  [ sect : methodii ] . when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are large , these two angular momenta become approximately classical objects , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "these objects are coupled with an interaction @xmath190 . by energy conservation , this quantity stays fixed , and since the lengths of both vectors are fixed the angle between the vectors @xmath188 and @xmath189 stays fixed . since the two vectors start out pointing in opposite directions , they remain pointing in opposite directions .",
    "the only possibility left is for the system to tilt as a whole , but that would violate momentum conservation , _ unless _ the total momentum of the system is _ zero _ ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "thus , the classical system is frozen , unless @xmath191 , which is a special point .",
    "our calculation shows that quantum mechanical effects actually resolve this discontinuity .",
    "the transition from the freeze - out to equilibration happens in some finite range of angular momenta .",
    "what physics sets this range ?",
    "let us consider the two angular momenta being added as semiclassical objects .",
    "then , in addition to the angular momenta in the @xmath124 direction , they each possess `` quantum '' angular momenta in the @xmath192 plane .",
    "these momenta are of the order @xmath193 that this is a quantum effect is seen by restoring the units : @xmath194 .",
    "this `` quantum '' angular momentum is what is responsible for the equilibration .",
    "when the two angular momenta are added , their @xmath192 quantum momenta are also combined and the net object has @xmath195 of the same order as the ingredients . if the net classical momentum along the @xmath124 axis is greater then @xmath195 , the equilibration will be suppressed .",
    "in other words , we arrive at the physical condition that determines the boundary between equilibration and `` freeze - out '' @xmath196 for large number of spins , we can simply replace in this condition @xmath197 .",
    "this boundary between freeze - out and equilibration can be quantified by the analytical expression for the equilibrium @xmath177 that can be derived for @xmath198 ( see appendix [ sect : appb ] ) : @xmath199 here , @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202    up to a small correction in the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : analyt_equil ] ) , @xmath175 depends on @xmath203 and @xmath204 in combination @xmath205 .",
    "moreover , @xmath206 quickly drops to zero as @xmath85 is increased beyond one .",
    "hence , the width @xmath184 of the `` quantum equilibration region '' indeed scales with @xmath14 as @xmath207 .",

    "we now discuss the time scales that control the evolution of our system .",
    "we are particularly interested to see how the evolution scales with the number of spins in the limit when the spin system is large .",
    "as already mentioned , the case of @xmath51 considered in f&l ii is straightforward : for large @xmath15 the evolution is uniquely dependent on @xmath208 and the decay curve is @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the imaginary error function @xmath211    our investigations in sect .",

    "we stress that this frequency depends on @xmath180 linearly .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations at the maximum is suppressed by @xmath224 , so as a function of @xmath184 the oscillations increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude .",
    "finally , the oscillations decay with time as only a power law and the decay time , @xmath225 increases with @xmath184 .",
    "compare this with the situation for @xmath51 , in which case the decay time scale is @xmath226 and the decay has exponential dependence .    at last ,",
    "what conclusions can be drawn about the applicability of the one - particle coherent hamiltonian in this case ?",
    "our conclusions is that one can define in what sense it is applicable , but the argument is a bit subtle . unlike in the case @xmath51 considered in f&l",
    "ii , in the more general setup considered here we find a new frequency , linearly dependent on the difference @xmath179 .",
    "can this be reconciled with eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_oneparticle ] ) , which states that in the neutrino system which begins as a collection of flavor eigenstates there should not be any flavor coherent conversion ?",

    "we first consider the case when n or m is one .",

    "each cosine in eq.([eq : period eqn ] ) satisfies ,    @xmath235 = \\cos\\left[g(t + t_j)(2j+2)\\right]\\ ] ]    here @xmath236 is the period of the cosine corresponding to angular momenta @xmath59 .",
    "now for all @xmath59 ,    @xmath237    to find the period we need the least common multiple of the @xmath236 s .",
    "we find the period ( together with the previous subsection ) to be ,    @xmath238    note that the period is the same for the case of a flavor eigenstate background and a flavor superposition background because the period only depends on the argument of the cosine .",
    "the argument of the cosine is the same for both cases .",
    "the discontinuity between the period when @xmath212 or @xmath232 and the other cases arises because in the first two cases there is an interference of many cosine waves ( as there the cosines are summed over ) and in the last case there is only one cosine wave . for @xmath33 ,",
    "our results reduce to that found in f&l ii .",
    "notice that , up to the factor of two controlled by whether @xmath14 is even or odd , the period of the spin system depends only on the value of the spin - spin coupling @xmath239 and not on the size of the spin system . for a neutrino system , @xmath240 and",
    "the period seems to depend on the volume occupied by the neutrino system .",
    "in fact , in a real neutrino gas , non - forward scattering effects would destroy any periodicity .",
    "we recall that for sufficiently large numbers of neutrinos the time scale of incoherent forward scattering , eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_inc ] ) , is much smaller than the period found here and , moreover , that forward incoherent scattering is only a small fraction of the total incoherent scattering ( see f&l ii ) .",
    "thus , the periodicity is an example of an effect in the spin system that is not realized in the actual neutrino system . in the context of the spin system , on the other hand",
    ", the effect is perfectly physical and indeed is reminiscent of the well - known ",
    "spin echo \" effect experimentally observed in actual spin systems .    as a final comment note that when we approximate the sums over the cosines by the integrals , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coh_analyt ] ) , ( [ eq : analyt_equil ] ) , and ( [ eq : asympt_firstterm ] ) , the periodicity of the solution is destroyed .",
    "this has to do with the disappearance of the fundamental ( lowest ) frequency in the system .",
    "the same observation was made in f&l ii for @xmath51 .",
    "let us call the case when @xmath241 ( which is the lowest possible value that the probability can be ) a perfect minimum . for the perfect minimum to occur we must have ,",
    "@xmath242 = -1 $ ] simultaneously for all @xmath59 .",
    "the period of each cosine decreases as @xmath59 increases , therefore we only need to find the time when the cosine with the largest period and the cosine with the smallest period are simultaneously equal to @xmath243 .    by a calculation analogous to that for the period one can show that if @xmath244 even there will never be a perfect minimum . if @xmath14 is odd the times when the probability attains a perfect minimum is ,    @xmath245    note that this is half way between perfect maxima ( the case where @xmath246 ) . hence if @xmath181 is odd ( or @xmath59 is half an integer ) the probability has both a perfect minimum and a perfect maximum .",
    "this result shows yet another intriguing physical feature of the spin system .",
    "while a system with @xmath244 even is characterized by a set of recurring maxima , in the system with @xmath244 odd every other such maximum is replaced by a minimum .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .",

    "obviously , it is important to understand if this finding corresponds to the behavior of a real neutrino gas .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , going from a neutrino gas to the spin model involves several simplifying assumptions : only forward scattering is kept , equal interaction strengths are assumed , the interactions are taken to be continuous in time , etc .",
