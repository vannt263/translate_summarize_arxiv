    "dynamics of classical disordered nonlinear chains is governed by an interplay of two fundamental phenomena : anderson localization ( al ) and chaos .",
    "al , originally introduced as full suppression of diffusion by interference in random lattices  @xcite and used to explain electronic metal - insulator transitions , turned out to be a universal wave phenomenon and was observed in such diverse systems as microwaves , light , acoustic waves , and ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "it is most pronounced in one dimension , where all eigenmodes of a disordered linear system are exponentially localized by arbitrarily weak disorder  @xcite .    by now , al is well understood for linear systems  @xcite . in the presence of a nonlinearity , the situation is more complicated , and many fundamental questions are still open .",
    "for example , it is unclear what happens to an initially localized wave packet at very long times ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . in a linear system with al , it remains exponentially localized at all times .",
    "with nonlinearity , the wave packet width was found to increase as a subdiffusive power of time  @xmath0 in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a rigorous argument shows that at long times the spreading , if any , must be slower than any power of time @xcite .",
    "analysis of perturbation theory in the nonlinearity suggests that there is a front propagating as @xmath1 beyond which the wave packet is localized exponentially  @xcite .",
    "an indication for a slowing down of the power law has also been seen in the scaling analysis of numerical results  @xcite .",
    "finally , a possible mechanism of breakdown of subdiffusion at long times is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in describing nonlinear system is that their dynamics can be chaotic @xcite . for hamiltonian systems , close to integrable and with a finite number of the degrees of freedom ,",
    "the volume of the chaotic phase space is small as long as the integrability - breaking perturbation ( in our case , the coupling between the oscillators or the nonlinearity ) is weak , as guaranteed by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem .    for a random system",
    ", the description of chaotic and regular motion has to be probabilistic . in the pioneering work  @xcite ,",
    "the existence of a dense set of regular trajectories was proven for a class of disordered weakly - nonlinear lattices .",
    "it has been argued for the disordered nonlinear schrdinger chain ( dnls ) that the measure of such set in the phase space is finite  @xcite .",
    "this measure , averaged over the disorder , was recently estimated for dnls both analytically  @xcite and numerically  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when the nonlinearity is weak , chaos should appear _",
    "locally_. namely , for a sufficiently long chain , arbitrarily separated in two segments , the probability to be on a regular trajectory is given by the product of the two individual probabilities for the segments .",
    "this naturally follows from two conditions : ( i )  if any of the segments is chaotic , the whole chain is chaotic , and ( ii )  the probabilities for the two segments are _",
    "independent_. moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite an explicit mechanism for chaos generation was proposed : two coinciding resonances for rare combinations of three oscillators . still , the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , did not agree quantitatively , and the origin of the discrepancy is currently not understood .",
    "evidence for a local origin of chaos has also been found in the simulations of the dynamics of a classical spin chain  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the probability of chaotic behavior ( appearance of a non - zero lyapunov exponent ) is studied for another system of coupled nonlinear oscillators [ see eq .",
    "( [ hfsw= ] ) below ] , which turns out to be simpler to analyze than the dnls .",
    "the probability of chaos is calculated at low energy densities  @xmath2 by two different methods : ( i )  by the analysis of the phase space of an effective hamiltonian describing a resonant triple of oscillators , in the spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , and ( ii )  by direct numerical sampling of many disorder realizations , and counting those with nonzero lyapunov exponent , analogously to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our main results are the following .",
    "( i )  the two calculations agree quantitatively , including both the leading low-@xmath2 scaling exponent , and the numerical prefactor , thereby confirming the dominant role of resonant triples in generation of chaos at low energies .",
    "( ii )  this agreement sets in at unexpectedly small values of  @xmath2 , while at moderately low  @xmath2 the numerical results fall on an intermediate asymptotics .",
    "this intermediate asymptotics is not controlled by any small parameter and seems to exist for purely numerical reasons ; the microscopic mechanism responsible for it remains unclear at the moment .",
    "here we study the model defined by the hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the coordinate and momentum of the @xmath5th oscillator , and @xmath6 are independent random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath7 @xmath8 being the disorder strength .",
    "this model belongs to the class of models considered in ref .",
    "it has also been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , in the latter two works focused on spreading of an initially localized wave packet , rather than on the probability of chaos .    the model of eq .",
    "( [ hfsw= ] ) is different from dnls in two aspects .",
    "first , it has only one conserved quantity ( energy ) in contrast to the two ( energy and total norm ) for dnls .",
    "second , it has only one dimensionless parameter , @xmath9 controlling both the nonlinearity and the coupling between the oscillators . in dnls they are controlled separately by two independent dimensionless parameters , and when both are small , it matters which one is smaller . in the fsw case , both limits of weak coupling and weak nonlinearity correspond to @xmath10 , which makes it easier to analyze than dnls .",
    "from now on , we measure momenta , coordinates , and time in the units of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively , which is equivalent to setting @xmath14 .    for a given realization of disorder @xmath15 and a given initial condition @xmath16 ,",
    "the system trajectory is either regular ( quasi - periodic ) or chaotic . characterizing each initial condition by the typical energy  @xmath2 per oscillator",
    ", we define the probability for the initial condition to be chaotic as @xmath17 where @xmath18 if the trajectory is chaotic and zero otherwise .",
    "( [ pfix= ] ) corresponds to fixing the energies of all oscillators to be  @xmath2 , and will be referred to as the fixed-@xmath2 ensemble .",
    "alternatively , one can fix the energies only on average , replacing the @xmath19-function in eq .",
    "( [ pfix= ] ) by @xmath20 $ ] , i.  e. a thermal distribution with temperature  @xmath2 ( provided that @xmath21 , which is our main focus )  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will work with the fixed-@xmath2 ensemble which is easier to handle numerically .",
    "the corresponding initial conditions can be represented as @xmath22 where the phases @xmath23 are uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the property of locality , mentioned in the introduction , leads to the dependence @xmath25 at sufficiently large  @xmath26 , where the quantity @xmath27 , which we call average chaotic fraction ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , does not depend on  @xmath26 .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to establish its asymptotic behavior @xmath28 , by two methods : ( i )  relating it to the chaotic phase volume of three resonant oscillators , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and ( ii )  by direct numerical sampling , analogously to ref .",
    "the latter method also provides a check for the locality hypothesis : if indeed @xmath25 , the quantity @xmath29 does not depend on  @xmath26 , so that all curves for different  @xmath26 should collapse on a single curve @xmath27 .",
    "thanks to the relative simplicity of the system defined by eq .",
    "( [ hfsw= ] ) , both calculations can be carried out all the way to the final result , which turns out to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 for the fixed-@xmath2 ensemble .",
    "the reduction of the problem to a few - oscillator configuration  @xcite is based on the two - resonance picture for weakly non - integrable systems @xcite .",
    "the strongest resonant term in the non - integrable perturbation of an integrable system ( the so - called guiding resonance ) produces a separatrix in the system phase space .",
    "this separatrix is destroyed by another term in the perturbation , which creates a thin stochastic layer in the surrounding part of the phase space . in a disordered system ,",
    "the main contribution to the chaotic phase space comes from those configurations of disorder and from those regions of the phase space where both perturbation terms are resonant , so one can not really distinguish between the one responsible for the appearance of the separatrix and the one responsible for its destruction .",
    "it is crucial that _ two _ resonance conditions should be met simultaneously .",
    "resonances involving many oscillators are expected to give a subleading contribution to the chaotic phase volume , as the corresponding perturbation terms can be generated in high orders of perturbation theory , thus resulting in high powers of  @xmath2 . the minimal number of oscillators needed to generate chaos in the model of eq .",
    "( [ hfsw= ] ) is two  @xcite .",
    "however , even if @xmath32 , the frequency of the separatrix - destroying perturbation , @xmath33 , can not be small for the chosen disorder distribution , @xmath34 , which leads to an exponential suppression of the chaotic phase volume @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the particular case of eq .",
    "( [ hfsw= ] ) , the situation is even worse : no separatrix exists in the phase space of the slow motion ( see appendix  [ app : couple ] ) . thus , the dominant contribution to the chaotic phase volume should come from triples of oscillators with all three frequencies close to each other .",
    "the oscillators should also be neighboring each other in space , since coupling distant oscillators requires high orders of perturbation theory and results in a high power of  @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath27 is essentially determined by the probability ( per unit length along the chain ) to find three neighboring oscillators whose frequencies differ by @xmath35 .",
    "this fixes the power @xmath36 .    to put this argument on a quantitative basis , we assume @xmath37 , and average eq .",

    "since the latter is smaller than the former , the combination of the two results would suggest that the wave packet spreading does not require chaos , which is quite counter - intuitive .",

    "[ fig : traj](d ) . we know it should be chaotic , as the corresponding realization of @xmath15 contains two neighboring resonances , introduced `` by hands ''",
    ". however , at @xmath197 energy exchange between the oscillators is so slow , that following their dynamics up to @xmath81 is insufficient to distinguish between regular and chaotic motion .",
    "this gives us the lower boundary on  @xmath2 .",
    "compare also the lowest curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj](c ) and the middle curve in fig .",

    "the former one is regular and the latter is chaotic , even though they have close values of @xmath198 .",

    "@xcite , as the criterion for chaos , may introduce systematic errors and affect the scaling .    the main observation from fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] is that for chaotic trajectories @xmath70 grows linearly on the average , corresponding to a finite lyapunov exponent , while for regular trajectories @xmath199 up to some weak noise , @xmath200  being some realization - dependent constant .",
    "this can be understood very simply : if two trajectories lie on neighboring invariant tori , their frequencies are only slightly different , so the phase mismatch between them is accumulated slowly and linearly in time .",
    "the distance between the trajectories is proportional to this phase mismatch , as long as the latter is small compared to unity .    to determine",

    "[ fig : traj ] is shown on the corresponding panel .",
    "thus , we consider the motion as regular if @xmath206<1 $ ] and chaotic otherwise .",
    "when the lyapunov exponent @xmath67 , it sets the natural upper time limit for the numerical integration of the differential equations .",
    "indeed , when the double - precision machine zero , @xmath207 , multiplied by @xmath208 becomes of the order of unity , the integration inevitably deviates from the original trajectory , no matter how good the integration scheme is .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath209 . to check this",
    ", we have performed the time - reversal test : at time @xmath210 , we invert all the momenta , and integrate up to @xmath211 .",
    "ideally , the system should return to its initial condition .",
    "this was found to be the case if @xmath212 ( for many trajectories whose lyapunov exponents differed by one or two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "thus , considering larger @xmath213 would produce the lyapunov exponent not for a given trajectory , but its certain average over the phase space .",
    "as we are interested not in the trajectory itself , but only in whether it is chaotic or regular , we consider the very fact that @xmath70 has reached 25 a sufficient evidence for chaos . if this happens within the integration time , @xmath214 , we stop the integration , and simply set @xmath215=30 $ ] .",
    "one could think that for every realization of the disorder @xmath15 and of the oscillator phases @xmath216 exists a threshold value  @xmath217 , such that for @xmath218 the motion is quasiperiodic , and for @xmath219 it is chaotic .",
    "indeed , a natural guess is that upon increase of the integrability - breaking parameter  @xmath2 the chaotic region of the phase space should grow .",
    "this would make the calculation for the fixed-@xmath2 ensemble more efficient , as one would not need to probe too small or too large values of  @xmath2 .",

    "the energy conservation was satisfied extremely well in all calculated trajectories , including those with largest lyapunov exponents , even at times when the time - reversal test had failed .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that use of an integration scheme which automatically respects some conservation laws of the original equations ( e.  g. , a symplectic integrator which preserves the phase space volume ) would lead to more accurate results for a given trajectory : the accuracy is lost primarily in the directions , orthogonal to conservation laws .",
