    "it has been proposed @xcite that the anomalous behaviors observed in the pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprates can be explained by assuming the existence of a new long - range ordered density - wave with @xmath0 symmetry ( ddw ) @xcite which competes with superconducting order . as a result of this order , the excitation spectrum acquires a partial gap with the same symmetry and structure as the gap observed in the pseudogap state .",
    "the ddw theory has been applied to explain several observed anomalies in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates @xcite .",
    "attempts to directly observe it in neutron scattering are encouraging @xcite .",
    "one of the arguments against the ddw theory is that it is inconsistent with in - plane optical conductivity measurements .",
    "the assumption has been that as the temperature is reduced below the pseudogap transition temperature @xmath1 , and a ( partial ) gap opens , some of the low - energy excitations are lost and this should cause a reduction in the low - frequency optical conductivity , which is compensated by an increase in the spectral weight at higher frequencies .",
    "such behavior is seen in some charge density - wave systems @xcite , but is not observed in the cuprates @xcite , which might be taken as an indication that the pseudogap is associated with superconducting fluctuations , which would cause a downward motion of spectral weight ( which would eventually coalesce into a zero - frequency @xmath2-function in the superconducting state ) .",
    "these experiments find no changes in the in - plane spectral weight within their error bars @xcite : spectral weight lost at the low - energy end of the measured frequency range appears ( perhaps unexpectedly ) at very low frequencies , and hence accompanies a narrowing of the low - energy optical conductivity peak .",
    "this phenomenon was interpreted in ref . as the lack of any in - plane optical evidence for the pseudogap .    in this paper",
    "we show how the ddw theory of the pseudogap can be consistent with this observed effect .",
    "the key to this phenomenon , we believe , ( as conjectured in ) is the strong anisotropy in the quasiparticle spectrum and scattering rate in the cuprates .",
    "arpes experiments clearly show that quasiparticles in the antinodal region of the brillouin zone ( @xmath3 ) , where the gap opens in the pseudogap phase , scatter much more strongly than they do in the nodal region ( @xmath4 ) , where the gap is zero .",
    "( while the transport lifetime is not the same as the quasiparticle lifetime observed in arpes , we assume that it has a similar anisotropy , as in `` hot spot '' and `` cold spot '' theories @xcite . ) the lost carriers , therefore , give a relatively small contribution to the conductivity .",
    "the loss of these carriers can be cancelled by a general reduction of all the scattering rates , as the temperature is reduced . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", this may also explain the observed behavior in several classes of spin - density - wave ( sdw ) and cdw systems .",
    "these ideas are borne out by a model calculation with the mean - field ddw hamiltonian and an _ ansatz _ for the quasiparticle lifetime .",
    "we show that when the lifetime has an anisotropic form motivated by arpes measurements , the conductivity spectral weight shifts downward , as in the cuprates . however , for an isotropic lifetime , the spectral weight shifts upward .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian for the ddw state is [ eqn : mean - field - ham ] h_ddw = _ * k * , [ ( _ * k*- ) c^_*k * c_*k * + ( i_*k * c^_*k * c_*k+q * + ) ] where @xmath5 is the annihilation operator of an electron in a state with momentum @xmath6 and spin @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the chemical potential , @xmath9 is the ddw order parameter and @xmath10 is the ddw ordering wave vector , with lattice spacing set to unity .",

    "we emphasize that the lifetimes which we adopt below are for illustrative purposes since our main goal is to show that an upward movement of spectral weight is not a necessary concomitant of the emergence of ddw order at finite temperature . we are not making any claims here about the correctness of these lifetimes .",
    "we take the imaginary part of the self - energy ( quasiparticle scattering rate ) to have the form [ eqn : lifetime - split ] _ 2 ( * k * , ; t ) = _ 2 ( ; t ) + ( * k * ) . where @xmath60 is temperature and frequency dependent with no momentum dependence and @xmath61 is strongly momentum dependent .",
    "such a form has been motivated by marginal fermi liquid phenomenology @xcite ( mfl ) . in this way of analyzing the data , it is assumed that the quasiparticle lifetime which comes from electron - electron scattering is independent of temperature and linear in energy for small temperatures and linear in temperature , independent of the binding energy for higher temperatures : ^mfl_2 ( ; t ) = ( || , t ) . in this _ ansatz _ , all of the angular dependence comes from _ elastic _ electron - electron scattering .",
    "this is a convenient form , but we will show that our results hold even for some others .    for instance , we repeat our calculations with the standard fermi liquid ( fl ) quasiparticle lifetime : ^fl_2 ( ; t ) = ( ^2 , t^2 ) . again assuming that the angular dependence comes from @xmath61 . in order to show that these particular forms of @xmath33-dependence are not playing a big role in shifts of sw , we have also tried @xmath33-independent forms of these scattering rates : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    while this form of the quasiparticle lifetime does not give the correct dc conductivity , it is still useful as a check because our goal is to emphasize the role of anisotropy and show that it can lead to a downward shift of spectral weight , regardless of its detailed frequency and temperature dependence .",
    "the quasiparticle lifetime is strongly anisotropic @xcite : excitations in the antinodal region are more strongly scattered than the ones in the nodal region by up to a factor of 5 .",
    "hence , the assumed form ( [ eqn : lifetime - split ] ) necessitates that @xmath61 be a strongly anisotropic function of @xmath64 .",
    "we take the form : _ aniso ( * k * ) = _ 0 ( 1 + ( k_x - k_y)^2 ) , where @xmath65 is the scattering strength in the nodal region .    in order to check the role of anisotropy in the eventual shifting of the sw , we also check the case in which @xmath61 is ( unrealistically ) isotropic : _ iso ( * k * ) = _ 0 .",
    "in figures [ fig : linear ] to [ fig : fl ] , we have plotted the real part of the optical conductivity vs @xmath33 , when the momentum - independent part of the lifetime is given by the four different forms listed above . in each figure the isotropic case is compared with the anisotropic one with the same set of parameters ( listed in the figure captions ) except for @xmath66 , which is smaller in the anisotropic case because of its extra ( larger than 1 ) prefactor . in all cases we have @xmath67 ,",

    "recent data by santander - syro _ et al _ @xcite , has questioned the previous belief that the opening of the pseudogap in the underdoped cuprates can be detected by in - plane optical conductivity measurements .",
    "the unexpected result that as the temperature is reduced ( and although a gap opens in the antinodal region of the brillouin zone ) , the spectral weight is still transferred to lower frequencies , was interpreted as lack of any pseudogap signature in the optical data . in this paper we showed that this effect is consistent with the ddw theory of the pseudogap state of the underdoped cuprates .    in the four sets of graphs of the previous section",
    "it can clearly be seen that the key factor in deciding which way the sw is transferred is isotropy or anisotropy of the scattering rate .",
    "it is shown that regardless of the form of the temperature and frequency dependence of the quasiparticle lifetime ( _ e.g. _ fermi liquid or non - fermi liquid ) the sw is shifted upward for the isotropic scattering rate while it is shifted downward for the anisotropic case .",
    "( we have not tried to find a form for the quasiparticle lifetime which correctly reproduces all of the transport data , but have focussed on the role of anisotropy and have shown that similar results are obtained for several different forms of frequency and temperature dependence . )    we believe the explanation to be as follows : the pseudogap opens in the antinodal region where the carriers are more strongly scattered than the ones in the nodal region , where there is no gap .",
    "therefore , we have lost those excitations which already gave relatively little contribution to the transport properties of the normal state .",
    "furthermore , by reducing the temperature , the scattering rate of all the excitations is reduced .",
    "our results clearly show that in the ( more realistic ) anisotropic case , the effect of lost excitations due to the gap opening can be more than canceled by a temperature - dependent reduction of the scattering rate for the rest of the excitations and hence a downward shift of the optical spectral weight .",
    "it is obvious that anisotropy is the key here , since for similar parameters for isotropic scattering rate , an upward transfer is observed .",
    "we note that similar considerations should apply to the case of 2h - tase@xmath74@xcite .",
