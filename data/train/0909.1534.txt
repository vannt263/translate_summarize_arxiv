    "finite temperature effects on hadron properties are currently investigated in heavy ion collision experiments , such as the ones at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven , and will be the subject of analyses at the cern large hadron collider @xcite .",
    "it is presently believed that the hot and dense medium where the hadrons are created modifies masses and widths , and that this distortion can be observed reconstructing the states produced in the hadron decays .",
    "a significant example is represented by heavy mesons like @xmath3 and the radial and orbital @xmath4 excitations : it is expected that these mesons have different behaviour when the temperature of the medium varies , with the lowest lying state ( @xmath3 ) surviving in the medium after the deconfinement transition , up to temperatures @xmath5 , while the excited states melt at temperatures close to the deconfinement temperature @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the theoretical tools used to describe these phenomena are lattice qcd , qcd sum rules , effective qcd theories and models of qcd @xcite . recently , in the framework of the gauge / string duality approach @xcite , it has been suggested that a description of a strongly coupled quantum gauge theory at finite temperature can be obtained from a semiclassical theory formulated into a higher dimensional anti - de  sitter ( ads ) spacetime containing a black hole ( bh ) @xcite . in order to achieve smoothness and completeness of the metric ,",
    "also the time direction must be compact @xcite ; the temperature is inversely proportional to the distance @xmath7 of the black hole horizon to the ads boundary : @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the smallest is the system , the highest is the effect of the thermal fluctuations .",
    "another way to describe finite temperature effects in a holographic description is to consider a thermal ads space , i.e. an anti - de  sitter space with a compact wick - rotated time , with no black hole . in this case , as in standard finite temperature field theory , the temperature is given by the inverse dimension of the compactified time direction .",
    "in ref.@xcite the gravity dual of @xmath9  sym theory on @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , has been studied , showing the existence of two phases .",
    "a critical temperature was found at which a first order hawking - page ( hp ) transition @xcite occurs between the thermal ads and the anti - de sitter - black hole ( ads - bh ) geometries , due to an inversion of the hierarchy of the free energies relative to the two metrics .",
    "limit is considered . ]",
    "the temperature at which this transition occurs has been identified with the deconfinement temperature of the gauge theory on the boundary , and large @xmath12 the deconfinement transition is found to be of first order @xcite . ] which in this way receives a remarkable geometric interpretation .    a description inspired to gauge / string duality has been applied to qcd considering , in particular , two holographic models constructed in the ( phenomenological ) so - called bottom - up approach : the hard wall ( hw ) and the soft wall ( sw ) model . in these two models , qcd is the gauge theory defined on the boundary of a five - dimensional holographic space .",
    "since gauge / gravity ( anti - de sitter / conformal field theory - ads / cft ) correspondence has been conjectured for a conformal theory defined on the boundary , the generalization of duality to qcd ( which is not a conformal theory ) requires a mechanism to break conformal invariance .",
    "the hw and sw models differ in the way this invariance is broken : a sharp cut - off of the holographic space , up to a maximum value of the fifth coordinate @xmath13 , is imposed in the hw model , with @xmath14 @xcite ; a background dilaton - like field , vanishing at the ads boundary and involving a dimensionful scale @xmath15 , is included in the soft wall model , implementing a smooth cut - off of the holographic space @xcite . at @xmath16 the two models allow to compute qcd quantities such as the spectrum and decay constants of light mesons and glueballs , meson form factors and strong couplings , qcd condensates : in many cases the agreement with experiment is noticeable . in those models ,",
    "the metric is not a dynamical field , hence , when generalized to the case of finite temperature , there is no reason to justify the occurence of a hawking - page phase transition of the kind described in @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of such transition has been inferred @xcite : considering the free energies of the thermal ads and ads - bh configurations , in both the models it was found that the stable metric is thermal ads at low temperatures and ads - bh at high temperatures .",
    "the temperature at which the transition occurs depends on the model : @xmath17 in the case of the hard wall model , @xmath13 being the position of the hard wall ; @xmath18 in the case of the soft wall model , @xmath19 being the dimensionful constant introduced by the background dilaton field in the model . using the value for @xmath19 determined at zero temperature , in the sw model",
    "the hp temperature is @xmath20 mev , @xmath21 being the mass of the @xmath22 meson @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hawking - page transition temperature @xmath23 is close to the qcd deconfinement temperature obtained , e.g. , by lattice qcd simulations .",
    "the presence of the hp transition has been found also in different holographic models of qcd @xcite .",
    "an analysis of vector mesons at @xmath0 has been carried out in the sw model with ads - bh metric for all values of @xmath1 , and the temperature dependence of vector meson masses and widths has been investigated @xcite . in this analysis ,",
    "the scale fixing the physical temperature , @xmath24 , which appears once again in the dilaton field , has been suitably chosen to obtain the masses of hidden charm vector mesons ( @xmath3 and radial excitations ) at @xmath16 .",
    "thus , it is assumed that the model describes @xmath4 in a thermalized medium , and a critical temperature has been identified , where the lightest charmed vector meson disappears from the two - point spectral function of the retarded two - point green s function of the vector operator @xmath25 in the boundary theory @xcite .    here we consider an analogous problem : we investigate the sw model with an ads - bh metric for all values of @xmath1 , thus including the effects of the temperature with no reference to the hp transition , focusing on the cases of scalar glueballs and scalar mesons .",
    "we show that , in both cases , the qualitative dependence on the temperature of the hadron masses and widths follows general expectations , the masses becoming lighter and the widths broader than at @xmath16 .",
    "however , the physical values of the temperature at which such phenomena occur are lower than found in determinations based , e.g. , on lattice qcd simulations , and occur in the confined phase of qcd , so that the use of ads - bh metric for all values of temperature is inappropriate . in order to describe qcd at finite @xmath1 by this model",
    ", the hawking - page transition must be taken into account , using the thermal ads metric for @xmath26 and the ads - bh metric for @xmath27 : we consider this case , finding a simple behaviour of the hadron masses and widths versus @xmath1 , different from the behaviour found using ads - bh for all @xmath1 .",

    "this suggests that a more refined dual model of finite temperature qcd could be found modifying the background dilaton , so that the qualitative behaviour is preserved while the temperature scale is enlarged .",
    "it is interesting to consider scalar glueballs at finite @xmath1 in the hard wall holographic model of qcd . in this model",
    "an ads slice is used , up to a maximum value of @xmath35 , @xmath13 , and there is no dilaton - like background field .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to put @xmath220 in the equations obtained in sect.[sect : glueball ] , imposing suitable boundary conditions . using the ads - bh metric for all values of @xmath1 , as done in an analysis of the static potential in qcd @xcite , two cases are possible . in the first one the black hole horizon",
    "is located beyond the ir cutoff @xmath13 : @xmath221 ; in the second one @xmath222 . in the first case , regardless of position of the horizon , the eigenfunctions can be obtained solving the equation of motion with boundary conditions : @xmath223 hence determining the mass squared of the scalar glueballs .    when @xmath224 , the horizon position @xmath7 becomes the only mass scale , and the equation of motion reads : @xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "the masses can be obtained imposing that the solution of is the _ in falling _",
    "solution into the black hole at @xmath227 and considering spectral function of the retarded green s function .",
    "once having obtained @xmath228 , the glueball mass is given by @xmath229 , hence non vanishing values of @xmath230 linearly increase with the temperature @xmath1 .",
    "however , the spectral function depicted in fig .  [ figrhohw ] has only one peak at @xmath231 ; therefore , when @xmath222 ( or @xmath232 ) the only value found for the scalar glueball mass is @xmath217 .",
    "the resulting plot of the squared masses at various temperatures @xmath1 is shown in fig.[figm2vsthw ] : dissociation occurs when @xmath235 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath236 mev , using the value of @xmath13 fixed from the mass of the @xmath22 meson in the hw model : @xmath237 mev@xmath238 @xcite .",
    "analogous results hold for mesons in hw at @xmath28 @xcite .    imposing the presence of the hawking - page transition , which occurs at @xmath239 mev , i.e. for @xmath222",
    ", the masses do not vary up to the critical temperature @xmath23 , at which they jump to @xmath217 .",
