    "in the standard electroweak model  @xcite , the couplings of the leptonic charged and neutral currents to the gauge bosons are independent of the lepton generation . measurements of the lifetime , @xmath4 , and the leptonic branching fractions , @xmath5 , of the tau lepton provide a test of this universality hypothesis for the charged current .",
    "the leptonic width of the tau lepton  @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7e,@xmath8 , depends on the coupling constants of the tau lepton and the lighter lepton to the w boson , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the masses of the tau lepton and the w boson .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are small corrections resulting from phase - space , radiation and the w propagator , respectively .",
    "for the decay of the muon , @xmath16 , the same formula applies , with the muon mass and coupling , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , replacing those of the tau .",
    "the comparison of the tau lifetime and leptonic branching fractions with the muon lifetime gives a direct measurement of the ratios @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "tau decays into hadrons are sensitive to the strong coupling constant , @xmath21 , at the tau mass scale . assuming universal coupling constants of the different lepton species to the w boson , the ratio of the hadronic width to the leptonic width , @xmath22 , can be expressed as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 contains the same corrections mentioned above .",
    "@xmath22 is calculated in perturbative qcd  @xcite : @xmath25    the quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 are elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite describe electroweak radiative corrections and non - perturbative qcd contributions , respectively . the quantity @xmath30 is estimated as @xmath30 = 27.5  @xcite .",
    "the perturbative theoretical uncertainty is taken to be @xmath30 = 27.5@xmath327.5 .",
    "this paper presents a measurement of the tau lepton lifetime with the l3 detector at lep , using data taken in 1995 at the @xmath31 pole .",
    "furthermore , data from 1994 are re - analysed using an improved calibration and alignment of the central tracker .",
    "the lifetime is measured from the decay length in three - prong tau decays and from the impact parameter of one - prong tau decays - prong tau lepton decay indicates a decay with @xmath32 charged particles in the final state . ] .",
    "the results are combined with our previously published analyses on data collected from 1990 to 1993  @xcite .",
    "previous measurements of the tau lepton lifetime have been reported by other experiments @xcite .",
    "the l3 detector is described in ref .",
    "this measurement is based primarily on the information obtained from the central tracking system , which is composed of a silicon microvertex detector ( smd )  @xcite , a time expansion chamber ( tec ) and a z - chamber .",
    "the smd is made of two concentric layers of double - sided silicon detectors , placed at about 6 and 8  cm from the beam line .",
    "each layer provides a two - dimensional position measurement , with a resolution of @xmath33 for normally incident tracks , in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the beam direction , denoted as @xmath34 and @xmath35 coordinates , respectively .",
    "the tec consists of two coaxial cylindrical drift chambers with 12  inner and 24  outer sectors .",
    "the sensitive region is between 10 and 45  cm in the radial direction , with 62 anode wires having a spatial resolution of approximately @xmath36 in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "the z - chamber , which is situated just outside the tec , provides a coordinate measurement along the beam axis direction .",
    "for this measurement data collected in 1994 and 1995 are used , which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 49 pb@xmath37 and 31 pb@xmath37 , respectively .    for efficiency and background estimates ,",
    "monte carlo events are generated using the programs koralz  @xcite for @xmath38 and , bhagene  @xcite for @xmath39 , diag36  @xcite for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 , and jetset  @xcite for @xmath46 .",
    "the monte carlo events are passed through a full detector simulation based on the geant program  @xcite , which takes into account the effects of energy loss , multiple scattering , showering and small time dependent detector inefficiencies .",
    "these events are reconstructed with the same program used for the data .",
    "the number of monte carlo events in each process is about ten times larger than the corresponding data sample .",
    "tau lepton pairs originating from @xmath31 decays are characterised by two low multiplicity , highly collimated jets in the detector .",
    "the selection of @xmath47 events is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here only a general outline is given . in order to have high - quality reconstruction of the tracks ,",
    "events are accepted within a fiducial volume defined by @xmath48 , where the polar angle @xmath49 is given by the thrust axis of the event with respect to the electron beam direction .",
    "the events must have at least two jets , and the number of tracks in each jet must be less than four .",
    "the background from @xmath50 events is reduced by requiring the total energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter to be less than @xmath51 of the centre - of - mass energy . to reduce background from @xmath52",
    "the sum of the absolute momenta measured in the muon spectrometer must be less than @xmath53 of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "if muons are not reconstructed in the muon chambers they are identified by an energy deposit in the calorimeters which is characteristic of a minimum ionising particle .",
    "if this is the case for one jet , the opposite jet is required to exhibit a hadronic signature .",
    "this rejects dimuon as well as cosmic - ray events .",
    "the cosmic - ray background is further reduced by requiring a scintillation counter hit within 5  ns of the beam crossing .",
    "in addition , the distance of closest approach to the interaction point measured by the muon chambers must be less than two standard deviations of the resolution .    following this procedure , @xmath54 and @xmath55 events are selected from the data collected in 1994 and 1995 , respectively . the selection efficiency in the fiducial volume is estimated to be 76% .",
    "the purity of the tau pair sample is 98% .",
    "for this measurement a high quality of the track reconstruction is essential .",
    "a prerequisite is the control of the alignment between smd and tec and the drift time to drift distance calibration for the tec .",
    "these calibrations , alignments and the estimation of resolution functions are performed with a clean sample of bhabha and dimuon events , where tracks are known to originate from a common vertex .",
    "particular effort is invested in the individual alignment of each sensor of the smd and in the calibration of the boundaries of the tec sectors .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in ref .",
    "the performance of the track reconstruction is estimated from the distance between the two tracks at the vertex projected into the @xmath34 plane .",
    "this quantity , called miss distance , is independent of the size and position of the @xmath56 interaction region .",
    "the distributions of miss distance for bhabha and dimuon events collected during 1994 and 1995 are shown in figure  [ fig : reso ] .",
    "a gaussian function is fitted to both distributions , from which an intrinsic resolution @xmath57 and @xmath58 is estimated for 1994 and 1995 , respectively .    to guarantee good tracks for the analysis ,",
    "the following cuts are made :    * number of hits in the tec @xmath59 .",
    "this ensures a good curvature measurement . *",
    "number of smd hits in the @xmath34 plane @xmath60 .",
    "this criterion selects tracks for which the error in the extrapolation to the vertex is well described by @xmath61 .",
    "* transverse momentum , @xmath62 .",
    "tracks with lower momenta have a larger uncertainty in the extrapolation to the vertex due to multiple coulomb scattering in the smd .",
    "* probability , @xmath63 , of the track fit larger than 1% .",
    "this requirement rejects bad fits .",
    "for three - prong tau decays , the decay vertex of the tau is reconstructed and its distance to the centre of the interaction region is measured .",
    "the decay vertex is found from a minimisation with respect to the vertex coordinates @xmath64 of the following @xmath65 : @xmath66 in this equation , @xmath67 is the distance of closest approach of a track to the decay vertex coordinates .",
    "the error , @xmath68 , is the quadratic sum of the intrinsic resolution , @xmath61 , and the error due to multiple coulomb scattering , @xmath69 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pc2 ] shows the distribution of the confidence level , @xmath63 , of the fit .",
    "decay vertices with @xmath70 contain in most cases tracks with wrongly matched smd hits and are rejected .",
    "the remaining distribution is flat , indicating a good description of the errors .",
    "figure  [ fig : dl ] shows the decay length distribution for the data collected in 1994 and 1995 .",
    "only decay length values in the range @xmath71~\\mbox{mm}$ ] with an error better than 5  mm are accepted for the lifetime determination .",
    "the number of selected decays is @xmath72 and @xmath73 for 1994 and 1995 data , respectively .    to obtain the average decay length ,",
    "an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is applied to the observed decay length distribution .",
    "the likelihood function is calculated from a convolution of an exponential @xmath74 , describing the tau decay time using the average decay length @xmath75 as a parameter , with a gaussian resolution function @xmath76 .",
    "the likelihood function is written as : @xmath77 in this equation the product runs over the accepted three - prong tau decays @xmath78 .",
    "the second term on the right hand side has been added to take into account background carrying no @xmath79 lifetime information .",
    "the background fraction , @xmath80 , is estimated from monte carlo and fixed in the fit .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath81 is evaluated from the convolution of a dirac delta function with the experimental resolution function .",
    "the fit minimises @xmath82 .",
    "average decay lengths of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are determined for data from 1994 and 1995 , respectively .",
    "the results of the fit are represented by the solid lines in figure  [ fig : dl ] .",
    "the tau lifetime and average decay length are related through the following expression : @xmath85 using this equation and taking into account the effects of radiation , lifetimes of @xmath86 and @xmath87 are obtained for the two data sets , where the errors are statistical only .    in order to check the decay length method , the analysis is repeated on a sample of monte carlo events .",
    "the difference between the input tau lifetime and the result of the fit is assigned as a systematic error due to the method .",
    "systematic effects due to the non - ideal description of the resolution function are estimated from a one @xmath88 variation of its parameters .",
    "the deviation of the smd radius from its nominal value is measured using bhabha and dimuon events by minimising the track coordinate residuals from overlapping silicon sensors .",
    "deviations of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are found in the data of 1994 and 1995 , respectively .",
    "these results are compatible with zero , and their uncertainties are translated into a systematic error on the lifetime .",
    "uncertainties in the fraction of background events carrying no lifetime information are estimated from a @xmath91 variation of the fraction .",
    "finally , the systematic error due to the fit range is estimated from the combined data by a 10% variation of their lower and upper bounds .",
    "this error also includes the effect of a variation of the cut on @xmath63 between 0.1 and 1.5% .",
    "table  [ tab : dlsys ] summarises the systematic errors for the decay length method .",
    "the lifetime measurements from the @xmath92 three - prong decays from 1994 and 1995 are combined .",
    "the systematic error due to the resolution function description is taken to be uncorrelated ; for the other errors a 100% correlation is assumed .",
    "the result is @xmath93",
    "a second measurement of the tau lifetime is obtained from the impact parameter in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis for one - prong tau decays .",
    "the impact parameter is the distance of closest approach , @xmath94 , of the track to the tau lepton production point , which is estimated by the beam position . in order to be sensitive to the lifetime , a sign is given to the impact parameter , according to the position of the intersection between the track and the tau direction of flight with respect to the beam position .",
    "the uncertainty on the impact parameter , @xmath95 , is described as the quadratic sum of the intrinsic detector resolution , @xmath61 , the size of the interaction region , @xmath96 , and a momentum dependent multiple coulomb scattering contribution , @xmath69 ,    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the azimuthal angle in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "the average values for the interaction region size are determined from bhabha and dimuon data and listed in table  [ tab : bspot ] .",
    "in contrast to the decay length method a more complicated function for the description of the tau decay is expected here , since for a one - prong tau decay the decay vertex is _ a priori _ not known . from a monte carlo study of the impact parameter distribution at generator level",
    "it is found that this function can be described in terms of three exponentials for positive and three exponentials for negative impact parameter values @xmath99 in this equation , @xmath100 represents the fraction of negative impact parameter values , which originate from an imperfect reconstruction of the tau flight direction .",
    "the slopes of the exponentials , @xmath101 , contain the lifetime dependence of the distribution .    as for the decay length method",
    ", the lifetime is extracted from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the observed distribution .",
    "the likelihood is now determined from the convolution of a double gaussian resolution function , which is obtained from bhabha and dimuon samples , with the function of eqn.(9 ) .",
    "the fit also accounts for background carrying no lifetime information .",

    "the beam spot size is varied according to its statistical errors .",
    "the change in the central value is assigned as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the effect of the average smd radial position uncertainty is treated in the same way as in the decay length analysis .",
    "the systematic effect due to the knowledge of the function @xmath106 is evaluated by taking into account its statistical uncertainty and its dependence on the tau lifetime in the range from 250 to 350  @xmath107 .",
