    "the top quark plays a special role in the standard model ( sm ) and holds great promise in revealing the secret of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the theoretical considerations include the following :    * with the largest yukawa coupling @xmath0 among the sm fermions , and a mass at the electroweak scale @xmath1 ( the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field ) , the top quark is naturally related to electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , and may reveal new strong dynamics @xcite . *",
    "the largest contribution to the quadratic divergence of the sm higgs mass comes from the top - quark loop , which implies the immediate need for new physics at the terascale for a natural ew theory @xcite , with susy and little higgs as prominent examples . *",
    "its heavy mass opens up a larger phase space for its decay to heavy states @xmath2 , _ etc . _",
    "* its prompt decay much shorter than the qcd scale offers the opportunity to explore the properties of a  bare quark \" , such as its spin , mass , and couplings .",
    "top quarks will be copiously produced at the lhc .",
    "the production and decay are well understood in the sm .",
    "therefore , detailed studies of the top - quark physics can be rewarding for both testing the sm and searching for new physics @xcite .",
    "in the sm , the top quark and its interactions can be described by -l_sm & = & m_t |t t + m_tv h |t t + g_s |t ^t^a t g_^a + e q_t |t ^t a _",
    "+ & + & g_w |t ^(g_v+g_a^5 ) t z _",
    "+ g2 _ q^d , s , b v_tq |t ^p_l q w^-_+h.c .",
    "besides the well - determined gauge couplings at the electroweak scale , the other measured parameters of the top quark are listed in table [ tab : i ] .",
    "@cccc@ @xmath3 ( pole ) & @xmath4 & @xmath5 & @xmath6 + ( 172.7 @xmath7 2.8 ) gev   & @xmath8   & @xmath9   & @xmath10 +    [ tab : i ]    the large top - quark mass is important since it contributes significantly to the electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "for instance , the one - loop corrections to the electroweak gauge boson mass can be cast in the form r = -3g_f m_t^282 ^2 ^ 2_w + 3g_f m_w^282 ^2 ( -56 ) . with the @xmath3 value in table [ tab : i ] ,",
    "the best global fit in the sm yields a higgs mass @xmath11 gev @xcite .",
    "the recent combined result from cdf and d0 at the tevatron run ii gave the new value @xcite m_t = 171.4 2.1  gev .",
    "the expected accuracy of @xmath3 measurement at the lhc is better than 1 gev @xcite , with errors dominated by the systematics .    to directly determine the left - handed @xmath12-@xmath13 gauge coupling of the top quark in the weak charged current",
    ", leptonic angular distributions and @xmath14 polarization information would be needed @xcite .",
    "no direct measurements are available yet for the electroweak neutral current couplings , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , although there are proposals to study them via the associated production processes @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the indirect global fits however indicate the consistency with these sm predictions @xcite .      due to the absence of the flavor - changing neutral currents at tree level in the sm ( the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism ) , the dominant decay channels for a top quark will be through the weak charged - currents , with the partial width given by @xcite ( tw^+q ) = |v_tq|^2 m_t^316v^2 ( 1-r_w)^2 ( 1 + 2r_w ) , [ eq : width ] where @xmath18 . the subsequent decay of @xmath14 to the final state leptons and light quarks is well understood .",
    "two important features are noted :    * since @xmath19 , a top quark will predominantly decay into a @xmath20 quark . while @xmath21 may not be practically measured via the top - decay processes , effective @xmath20-tagging at the tevatron experiments has served to put a bound on the ratio = |v_tb|^2 , that leads to the lower bound for @xmath4 in table [ tab : i ] . *",
    "perhaps the most significant aspect of eq .",
    "( [ eq : width ] ) is the numerics : ( tw^+q ) 1.5   > _ qcd~200  .",
    "this implies that a top quark will promptly decay via weak interaction before qcd sets in for hadronization @xcite .",
    "so no hadronic bound states ( such as @xmath22 , _ etc . _ ) would be observed .",
    "the properties of a ",
    "bare quark \" may be accessible for scrutiny .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the top - quark rest frame , the longitudinal polarization of the @xmath14 is the dominant mode .",
    "the ratio between the two available modes is ( tb_l  w_=0)(tb_l  w_=-1 ) = m_t^22m_w^2 .",
    "[ eq : pol ]        historically , quarks were discovered via their hadronic bound states , most notably for the charm quark via @xmath24 and bottom quark via @xmath25 . due to the prompt decay of the top quark ,",
    "its production mechanisms and search strategy are quite different from the traditional one .",
    "the leading processes are the open flavor pair production from the qcd strong interaction , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pptt ] .",
    "the contributing subprocesses are from q|q ,  gg t|t .",
    "[ tt - tt ] the cross sections have been calculated rather reliably to the next - to - leading order @xcite and including the threshold resummations @xcite , as given in table [ tab : xsectiontt ] .    .",
    "cross sections , at next - to - leading - order in qcd , for top - quark production via the strong interaction at the tevatron and the lhc @xcite .",
    "also shown is the percentage of the total cross section from the quark - antiquark - annihilation and gluon - fusion subprocesses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : fcnc ]",
    "the most striking signal of new physics in the top - quark sector is the resonant production via a heavy intermediate state @xmath26 . with some proper treatment to identify the top decay products ,",
    "it is possible to reconstruct the resonant kinematics .",
    "one may thus envision fully exploring its properties in the c.m .",
    "frame .",
    "immediate examples of the resonant states include higgs bosons @xcite , new gauge bosons @xcite , kaluza - klein excitations of gluons @xcite and gravitons @xcite , technicolor - like dynamical states @xcite etc .",
    "the signal can be generically written as ( pp xt|t ) & = & _ ij dx_1 dx_2 f_i(m_x^2 , x_1 ) f_j(m_x^2,x_2 ) + & & 4 ^ 2 ( 2j+1)s ( xij ) b(xt|t ) m_x .",
    "thus the observation of this class of signals depends on the branching fraction of @xmath28 as well as its coupling to the initial state partons .",
    "figure [ fig : x ] quantifies the observability for a bosonic resonance ( spin 0,1,2 ) for a mass up to 2  tev at the lhc @xcite via @xmath29 .",
    "the vertical axis gives the normalization factors ( @xmath30 ) for the cross section rates needed to reach a @xmath31 signal with a luminosity of 10 fb@xmath32 .",
    "the normalization @xmath33 defines the benchmark for the spin 0 , 1 and 2 resonances .",
    "they correspond to the sm - like higgs boson , a @xmath34 with electroweak coupling strength and left ( l ) or right ( r ) chiral couplings to sm fermions , and the randall - sundrum graviton @xmath35 with the couplings scaled with a cutoff scale as @xmath36 for @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "we see that a @xmath34 or a graviton should be easy to observe , but a higgs - like broad scalar will be difficult to identify in the @xmath23 channel .",
    "it is of critical importance to reconstruct the c.m .",
    "frame of the resonant particle , where the fundamental properties of the particle can be best studied .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that with the semi - leptonic decays of the two top quarks , one can effectively reconstruct the events in the c.m .",
    "this relies on using the @xmath40 constraint to determine the missing neutrino momentum , while it is necessary to also make use of @xmath3 to break the two - fold ambiguity for two possible @xmath41 solutions .",
    "parity and cp asymmetries @xcite can be studied .",
    "top - quark pair events at the high invariant mass are obviously important to search for and study new physics . in this new territory there",
    "comes a new complication : when the top quark is very energetic , @xmath42 , its decay products may be too collimated to be individually resolved by the detector @xmath43 recall that the granularity of the hadronic calorimeter at the lhc is roughly @xmath44 .",
    "this is a generic problem relevant to any fast - moving top quarks from heavy particle decays @xcite ( see the next sections ) .",
    "the interesting questions to be addressed may include :    * to what extent can we tell a  fat top - jet \" from a massive qcd jet due to showering ? * to what extent",
    "can we tell a  fat @xmath14-jet \" from a massive qcd jet ?",
    "* can we make use of a non - isolated lepton inside the top - jet ( @xmath45 ) for the top - quark identification and reconstruction ?",
    "* can we do @xmath20-tagging for the highly boosted top events ?",
    "these practical issues would become critical to understand the events and thus for new physics searches .",
    "detailed studies including the detector effects will be needed to reach quantitative conclusions .      in many theories beyond the sm",
    ", there is a top - quark partner .",
    "these are commonly motivated by the  naturalness \" argument , the need to cancel the quadratic divergence in the higgs mass radiative correction , most severely from the top - quark loop .",
    "besides the scalar top quark in susy , the most notable example is the little higgs theory @xcite .",
    "if there is no discrete symmetry , the top partner @xmath47 will decay to sm particles in the final state , leading to fully a reconstructable fermionic resonance .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that the single @xmath47 production via the weak charged - current may surpass the pair production via the qcd interaction due to the longitudinal gauge boson enhancement for the former and the phase space suppression for the latter .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tj ] .",
    "subsequent simulations @xcite performed by the atlas collaboration demonstrated the clear observability for the signals above the backgrounds at the lhc for @xmath48 with a mass @xmath49 tev , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : tz ] .",
    "although the top - quark partner is strongly motivated for a natural electroweak theory , it often results in excessively large corrections to the low energy electroweak observables . in order to better fit the low energy measurements , a discrete symmetry is often introduced , such as the r - parity in susy , kk - parity in ued , and t - parity in lh @xcite .",
    "the immediate consequence for collider phenomenology is the appearance of a new stable particle that may provide the cold dark matter candidate , and results in missing energy in collider experiments .",
    "the top partner has similar quantum numbers to the top quark , and thus is commonly assigned as a color triplet .",
    "this leads to their production in qcd q|q ,  gg t |t .",
    "the production cross section is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] for both spin-0 and spin-1/2 top partners .",
    "although there is a difference of a factor of 8 or so ( 4 from spin state counting and the rest from threshold effects ) in the cross sections , it is still challenging to tell a scalar and a fermionic partner apart @xcite due to the lack of definitive features .",
    "due to the additional discrete symmetry , the top partner can not decay to a sm particle alone .",
    "consequently , @xmath51 , leading to @xmath23 pair production plus large mixing energy . the crucial parameter to characterize the kinematical features is the mass difference @xmath52 . for @xmath53 , the top quark as a decay product will be energetic and qualitatively different from the sm background .",
    "but if @xmath54 , then the two will have very little difference , making the signal difficult to separate out .",
    "depending on the top - quark decay , we present two classes of signals .      for both @xmath23 to decay hadronically @xcite",
    ", the signal will be 6 jets plus missing energy .",
    "while it has the largest decay rate , the backgrounds would be substantial as well . with judicious acceptance cuts ,",
    "the signal observability for @xmath56 gev was established , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] .",
    "possible measurements of the absolute mass scale and its spin of the top partner were considered @xcite , but the determination remains difficult .",
    "if one of the @xmath23 decays hadronically and the other decays leptonically , the signal may be cleaner .",
    "it turns out that if the mass difference @xmath57 is sizable , then requiring large missing transverse energy may be sufficient to suppress the background .",
    "however , if @xmath58 , then the @xmath59 for the signal is not much different from the background . on the other hand",
    ", the fact that the @xmath23 kinematics can be fully reconstructed in the sm implies that the reconstruction for the signal events would be distinctive due to the large missing mass .",
    "indeed , the reconstructed @xmath60 based on the @xmath59 will be far away from the true @xmath3 , and mostly result in an unphysical value .",
    "if we impose |m_t - m_t^r | > 110   , we can reach optimal signal identification . the summary plot for the statistical significance ( the number of @xmath61 )",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigt ] at the lhc with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath32 , where the left panel is for a fermionic @xmath47 , and the right is a scalar @xmath62 , both decaying to @xmath63 a missing particle .",
    "searching for exotic events related to the top quark can be rewarding .",
    "first , there exists a variety of natural electroweak models with distinctive top partners that should not be overlooked for collider phenomenology .",
    "second , potentially large couplings of the top quark to new physics may result in multiple top quarks from new particle decays .",
    "finally , the exotic events have less sm background contamination , and thus may stand out for discovery even at the early phase of the lhc . we briefly list a few recent examples .    * multiple top quarks and @xmath20-quarks in the final state",
    "may help to search for new heavy particles in the electroweak sector and can be distinctive from the sm backgrounds @xcite .",
    "* heavy top partners and other kk fermions in the rs model may lead to unique top - quark and @xmath14-boson signatures @xcite . *",
    "new exotic colored states may predominantly couple to heavy quarks and thus lead to multiple top quarks in the final state @xcite . * composite models for the right - handed top - quark may lead to @xmath64 signals at the lhc @xcite . * like - sign top quark pairs may indicate new dynamics @xcite .",
    "the lhc will be a true top - quark factory . with 80 million top - quark pairs plus 34 million single tops produced annually at the designed high luminosity",
    ", the properties of this particle will be studied to a great accuracy and the deep questions related to the top quark at the terascale will be explored to an unprecedented level .",
    "theoretical arguments indicate that it is highly likely that new physics associated with the top quark beyond the sm will show up at the lhc .",
    "this article only touches upon the surface of the rich top quark physics , and is focused on possible new physics beyond the sm in the top - quark sector .",
    "the layout of this article has been largely motivated by experimental signatures for the lhc .",
    "interesting signatures covered here include    * rare decays of the top quark to new light states , or to sm particles via the charged and neutral currents through virtual effects of new physics . *",
