    "functional materials , as exemplified by magnetoelectronic materials , ferroelectrics , thermoelectrics , or unconventional superconductors , usually rely essentially on strong coulomb correlations or spin - orbit coupling in the system .",
    "that is why magnetic elements or heavy elements play a crucial role there , as in the unconventional superconductivity involving transition - metal compounds@xcite and topological insulators involving heavy elements@xcite .",
    "all the more acutely , we can pose a converse question : can we explore possibilities to realize such unique physical properties in _ light - element _ materials , by designing unconventional structures ?    among light elements ,",
    "carbon is unique and promising .",
    "its covalent nature enables the atoms to have a variety of structures , ranging from three - dimensional diamond down to zero - dimensional fullerene , and the electronic structure dramatically changes accordingly .",
    "the scale of the band width goes from @xmath3 ev in graphene@xcite down to @xmath4 ev in solid fullerene@xcite .",
    "carbon nanotube becomes a metal or semiconductor depending on its chirality@xcite .",
    "indeed , there is a body of theoretical and experimental investigations on functional materials made from carbon .",
    "for instance , shima and one of the present authors theoretically proposed that long - period ( i.e. , antidot - array ) graphene structures accommodate a unique platform for ferromagnetism as well as a manipulation between metallic and semiconducting band structures@xcite .",
    "now , an even more intriguing avenue that may harbor rich possibilities in electric properties is , in our view , three - dimensional periodic networks of carbon atoms .",
    "a recent remarkable example due to kyotani and coworkers is the zeolite - templated carbon ( ztc ) , which is a unique class of carbon networks fabricated by employing a zeolite framework as a template ( where zeolite is taken away after fabrication)@xcite .",
    "a fascination with zeolite is its versatile ( almost 200 known ) structures@xcite , so various ztcs are expected to be possible .",
    "another fascination is zeolites open structures with large cages arranged with long periods .",
    "in fact , regularly arranged alkali clusters in zeolite exhibit a variety of unusual physical properties , including ferromagnetism@xcite despite the system comprising only nonmagnetic elements .",
    "an important theoretical picture that has emerged from the system is that the electronic structure of the alkali - metal loaded zeolites can be captured in the  superatom \" model@xcite , where the whole electronic band structure can be described surprisingly accurately as a tight - binding model of wannier orbitals , which reside on each zeolite cage with a linear dimension @xmath3   but can have symmetries such as s and p. a message suggested by this is we may design versatile functional systems by controlling the arrangement of superatoms and/or the nature of each superatom .    in the present work we go one step further in seeking a possibility of realizing unusual electronic structures from unusual geometries . we shall propose that a zeolite - templated carbon can indeed harbor , when its crystal structure is noncentrosymmetric , an unusual , asymmetric band dispersion arising from  chiral \" superatoms having orbital magnetic momenta of @xmath2 . so in this paper , we first obtain , with an _ ab initio _ density - functional calculation , the electronic structure of ztc , for which the zeolite y is used as the template . while this system has been experimentally studied intensively due to its high hydrogen storage ability@xcite , theoretical studies have been quite limited , since the crystal structure is extremely complicated and has not been determined experimentally .",
    "recently , kyotani _",
    "et al . _ have constructed several possible atomic structure models@xcite . there , one possibility is a kind of network of carbon nanotubes@xcite .",
    "another possibility , on which we focus here , is a network of nanographenes in a form of buckybowl ( as opposed to buckyball ) in a three - dimensionally regular structure .",
    "here we take the simplest model , in which the building block is c@xmath0h@xmath1  nanographene with hydrogen termination ( called c@xmath0h@xmath1  patch hereafter ) ( fig .",
    "we shall show that , while there are as many as 24 valence bands due to the complicated structure , it is possible to construct a simplified tight - binding model in terms of the maximally - localized wannier functions for these bands , where the essence is a surprisingly simple three - orbital model on the diamond lattice with eight lattice points per unit cell .",
    "the three orbitals , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , on each c@xmath0h@xmath1  patch can be seen , respectively , as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals of a superatom with the orbital angular momenta @xmath10 , although the symmetry of the three orbitals is lower than that of the atomic @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "now , what is unusual is the following : the present crystal structure may be viewed as a network of ( three - winged )  pinwheels \" ( consisting of four c@xmath0h@xmath1  patches ; fig .",
    "1(b ) ) , where each pinwheel has a threefold axis but lacks the inversion symmetry ( hence its name ) .",
    "this deprives the crystal structure of the inversion symmetry as well , which makes valence top made from _ chiral states _ , which are symbolically @xmath12 , which belongs to the irreducible representation of e ( see below ) .",
    "the two chiral bands are shown to have different band dispersions , which reminds us of spin - orbit split bands in gaas but the cause of the splitting in the former is totally different .",
    "we finally predict that we can induce an electric - field - induced orbital magnetism if we dope carriers into the system and apply an external electric field . although the asymmetric band dispersion has nothing to do with spin - orbit interaction , the unusual feature implies , in its own right , that a current - induced orbital magnetism is expected by hole doping .",
    "to obtain the electronic properties , we have performed a first - principles calculation@xcite within the local - density approximation ( lda)@xcite .",
    "ultrasoft pseudopotentials are used to describe the electron - ion interaction@xcite .",
    "the valence wave functions and charge densities are expanded by a plane - wave basis with cutoff energies of 30 ry and 150 ry , respectively .",
    "integration over brillouin zone is carried out with @xmath13 @xmath14 points .",
    "we have employed the wannier90 code@xcite to compute the maximally - localized wannier orbitals .",

    "figure [ fig : structure ] shows the geometry of c@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "the structure is theoretically optimized with the experimental lattice constant of @xmath15 24.07  .",

    "inset shows the first brillouin zone . ]",
    "the obtained electronic band structure of c@xmath0h@xmath1  in fig .  [ fig : band ] shows that c@xmath0h@xmath1  is an insulator with a band gap of 0.84 ev .",
    "since the three - dimensional network comprises nanoflakes , the band structure resembles those of molecular crystals where weakly coupled molecular orbitals result in a narrow band widths .",
    "the valence band top ( @xmath18 in ev ) comprises 24 bands that are isolated from lower ones with an energy gap .",
    "interestingly , the top and bottom of this region are delineated by almost flat bands .",
    "the band widths of these nearly flat bands are around 0.05 ev , which is much smaller even when compared with that of t@xmath19-band in fullerene compounds ( @xmath20 0.3 - 0.5 ev ) .",
    "naively , one might expect magnetic or other instabilities with hole doping for these flat bands , but we have not found any magnetic orders such as ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism within the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "let us then characterize these bands in terms of maximally - localized wannier functions .",
    "figures [ fig : mlwfs](a)-(c ) visualize the maximally - localized wannier orbitals for the 24 bands . on each ",
    "pinwheel \" reside three , equivalent wannier orbitals that spread , respectively , along the three  wings \" ( i.e. , along the three next - nearest directions ) .",
    "these three orbitals , which we call @xmath21 , conform to the threefold symmetry of the pinwheel , and , in the superatom language , roughly correspond to @xmath22 orbitals .",
    "thus we may regard the system as a  @xmath11-electron superatom system \" on the diamond lattice .",
    "however , crucial differences between the present superatom system and usual diamond are : ( i ) there are no @xmath23-orbitals , and ( ii ) @xmath11-orbitals do not have full symmetries that the atomic @xmath11-orbitals have and are symmetric only under a three - fold axis rotation .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that each @xmath11-orbital has its center of wave function shifted from the center of the superatom ( i.e. , the center of the pinwheel ) unlike the atomic @xmath11-orbitals .",
    "state , or ( b ) @xmath24 . ]     state , or ( b ) @xmath24 . ]    due to the symmetry of the present @xmath11-orbitals , these valence bands should be characterized by an a state and two e states given as @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 state ) is the symmetric combination of the three wannier functions , while @xmath28 ( @xmath29 states ) have finite angular momenta associated with rotation around the threefold axis . with these states",
    "it is found that , the doubly - degenerate valence - top wavefunctions , for example out of the 24 bands , comprise entirely from @xmath28 at the @xmath30 point from the symmetry analysis@xcite .",
    "the calculated weights of @xmath26 and @xmath28 are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : weight](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the nearly flat bands along the top and bottom of the 24 bands originate from the finite - angular - momentum @xmath24 states , while the dispersive bands from @xmath26 .",
    "h@xmath1  represented by the obtained tight - binding model . each black sphere represents a c@xmath0h@xmath1  patch , while wings of a pinwheel illustrate wannier orbitals .",
    "the transfer integrals are : @xmath31 ev , @xmath32 ev , @xmath33 ev , and @xmath34 ev . ]    figure [ fig : tightbinding ] illustrates the tight - binding model for the 24 bands obtained in terms of the maximally - localized wannier orbits ( wings of a pinwheel in the figure ) .",
    "since the maximally - localized wannier functions are basically localized on each patch , it is natural that the @xmath35 bands are all accurately described by them .",
    "there are three transfer integrals , @xmath36 ev , @xmath32 ev , and @xmath33 ev , between nearest - neighbor patches , while the largest transfer integral between second - neighbor patches is @xmath34 ev .",
    "these exhaust the transfer integrals whose magnitudes exceed @xmath37 ev . although the unit cell of the ztc is huge and complicated ( containing more than 300 atoms ) , these four transfer integrals suffice to reproduce the dispersions of the 24 valence bands around the fermi level .",
    "now we come to the key result in the present work in fig.[fig : weight2 ] , which depicts the structure of the topmost five valence bands , with the main character of each band indicated in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . remarkably , the two topmost bands are _ asymmetric _ with respect to @xmath30 point .",
    "they arise from the absence of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure , and transform with each other by the time - reversal .",
    "the feature may seem reminiscent of the noncentrosymmetric systems with strong spin - orbit coupling , but the cause of the splitting is totally different here .",
    "a conventional spin - orbit model is rashbas@xcite : in a two - dimensional electron gas with a strong spin - orbit coupling , the spin is no longer a good quantum number , but the bands are still degenerated due to the kramers degeneracy . if we apply an electric field perpendicular to the plane , the degeneracy is lifted , and a vortex - like spin texture is generated . even in the absence of electric fields , various spin textures can emerge if the system is inversion asymmetric@xcite . in fact , the original proposal by rashba was made for noncentrosymmetric wurtzite semiconductors@xcite .",
    "such systems harbor a possibility of manipulation of the spin degree of freedom by applying an external electric field@xcite . in materials belonging to the gyrotropic point group ,",
    "charge current is generically accompanied by a nonzero spin polarization@xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the present ztc we can expect a _",
    "current - induced orbital magnetism _ : if we dope holes to extract the peculiar property of the valence top and apply an external electric field , the charge carriers drift in the direction of the applied field , so that the population of the @xmath40 states will exceed that of @xmath41 as in the spin - orbit case@xcite , since the band structure of the two orbital - magnetic states is asymmetric around the @xmath30 point as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weight2]@xcite . for example",
    ", if we dope 0.05 holes per unit cell and apply an external electric field in ( 1,1,1 ) direction so that the electrons acquire the quasimomentum @xmath42 in the unit of @xmath43 , the resulting orbital magnetic moments , in units of @xmath44 per unit cell , are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the orbital magnetic moment contributed from c@xmath0h@xmath1  patch whose normal direction is @xmath50 .",
    "since the quantization axis differs from one patch to another , these moments do not cancel with each other , and the total orbital magnetic moment in ( 1,1,1 ) direction is @xmath51 .",
    "when the electric field and/or the number of holes are varied , the magnetic moment increases roughly proportional with the field and with the number of holes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : weight2](c ) .",
    "the current - induced orbital magnetism in the present mechanism exploits the fact that electrons are confined on the curved surface of the c@xmath0h@xmath1  patch .",
    "namely , in an electric field along , say , ( 1,1,1 ) , electrons on a pinwheel @xmath52 can not move along that direction , but edge currents are generated instead . due to inversion asymmetry , the right - handed and left - handed edge currents do not cancel with each other , which will induce an orbital magnetic moment .",
    "thanks to the small width of the relevant bands , a relatively small electric field should suffice to induce such an orbital magnetism .",
    "this contrasts with the usual exploitation of magnetoelectric effects in solids for spintronics@xcite , where appreciable spin - orbit interaction is required to couple the motion of charge with the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the present mechanism for the current - induced orbital magnetism requires no spin - orbit coupling , so that we may expect that this mechanism will open a new avenue for light - element functional materials .",
