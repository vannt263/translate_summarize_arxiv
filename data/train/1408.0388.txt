    "practical computations within dft make use of the kohn - sham theorem @xcite , which defines a system of @xmath1 non - interacting single - particle wave functions that are able to provide a system of equations to find the exact charge density of the interacting system . however , the complexity of the many - body system is still present in the so called exchange - correlation functional , which is unknown and needs to be approximated .",
    "dft has had a great success , mostly , in chemistry and material science @xcite , both , dealing with equilibrium systems .",

    "tddft has been reformulated in terms of the current density @xcite and extended into a stochastic time - dependent current density when the system is interacting with a bath @xcite .",
    "the common strategy in all many - particle approximations is to obtain the observable result from mathematical entities defined in a real space , @xmath2 , ( single - particle wave functions for hf and charge density for dft ) rather than from the many - particle wave function , whose support is defined in the configuration space @xmath3 .",
    "bohmian mechanics @xcite is a consistent explanation of quantum phenomena based on the use of wave functions and trajectories . apart from its ontological implications , bohmian mechanics is nowadays used as a mathematical machinery that is able to reproduce the wave function evolution from fluid lines @xcite .",

    "one can naturally find a single - particle wave function defined in @xmath2 , while still capturing many - particle features of the system .",
    "such an entity is named conditional wave function @xcite , and it is built by substituting all degrees of freedom present in the many - particle wave function , except one , by its corresponding bohmian trajectories .",
    "this substitution produces a single - particle wave function with a complicated time - dependence @xcite .",
    "recently , many - particle bohmian trajectories associated to the conditional wave function have been investigated by oriols et al . @xcite and",
    "the idea of introducing exchange interaction into non - separable systems through conditional wave functions was briefly indicated in the seminal work of ref .",

    "the paper also includes the implementation of the exchange algorithm into a numerical simulator of quantum electron transport , justifying its numerical viability in practical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in we provide an introduction to many - particle wave functions and bohmian mechanics . for such introduction , we will use many - particle wave functions for separable hamiltonians . from a didactic point of view",
    ", these simple systems will be useful to discuss how the exchange interaction determines the behavior of the bohmian trajectories of identical particles . in",
    ", we will explain how to compute many - particle bohmian trajectories for identical particles for non - separable hamiltonians , without computing the many - particle wave function .",
    "ensemble results for the kinetic , classical and quantum potential energies will be discussed for systems with and without exchange interaction . finally , in",
    ", we show the numerical viability of the algorithm to include exchange and coulomb interaction for electron transport simulators . in we",
    "present the conclusions and some additional discussions .",
    "in this section , we introduce many particle wave functions and bohmian mechanics to explain general properties of bohmian trajectories associated to identical particles .",
    "these discussions will be of great utility in the subsequent sections .      for non - relativistic open systems of @xmath1-particles , a general expression for a many - particle wave function , @xmath4 , with or without exchange interaction ,",
    "is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the position of the @xmath7-th particle and @xmath8 is the @xmath9-component of its spin , which can take the value @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 ) for spin up and @xmath12 ( or @xmath13 for spin down .",
    "the normalization constant is @xmath14 .",
    "the sum in is over all possible combinations of spin @xcite .    in most discussions of this paper ( except the numerical results discussed in )",
    "we will assume that the quantum system is described by just one of the terms in .",
    "in particular , we will consider the term where all spins are parallel , e.g. , @xmath15 for @xmath16 . in order to simplify our notation ,",
    "the orbital part of this term will be written as @xmath17 , without any reference to the spins because their interchange becomes irrelevant .",
    "therefore , the ( orbital ) wave function is solution of the following many - particle schrdinger equation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the free electron mass and @xmath20 is a non - separable potential . by construction , we know that the solution of satisfies the following continuity equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the expectation values of the current probability density @xcite and @xmath23 the presence probability density .",
    "this last result will be relevant in when presenting bohmian trajectories .",
    "two particles are said to be identical if there are no experiments that can detect differences between them .",
    "this restriction on observable results can be satisfied by imposing the following property into the wave function @xmath24 of identical particles : @xmath25 for any @xmath7 and @xmath26 indices .",
    "we consider @xmath27 for bosons ( symmetry ) and @xmath28 for fermions ( antisymmetry ) .",
    "we say that the system has exchange interaction when the wave function satisfies . for physical systems of identical particles ,",
    "the many - particle potential in remains invariant under the permutation of two positions , i.e. @xmath29 for any @xmath7 and @xmath26 , and the symmetry or antisymmetry property of the wave function in for time @xmath30 holds for all instants .",
    "next , as a simple example of the difference between systems with and without exchange interaction , we discuss on the total energy , which will be useful later in .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 particles in free space .",
    "for simplicity , we consider 1d particles where its position is defined in @xmath31 .",
    "then , the many - particle wave function @xmath32 at @xmath33 can be constructed from the following single - particle gaussian wave packets : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the spatial dispersion , @xmath36 the central position , @xmath37 the central energy of each wave packets and @xmath38 the central wave vector .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1-particle wave function @xmath32 with exchange interaction can be defined from : @xmath39 where the sum is over all @xmath40 permutations @xmath41 and @xmath14 is a normalization constant . for fermions ,",
    "the @xmath42 means the sign of the permutations , i.e. is the slater determinant .",
    "alternatively , we will consider @xmath43 for bosons , meaning that has to be interpreted as the permanent .",
    "on the other hand , the wave function for particles without exchange interaction can be written as : @xmath44 which , by construction , is already well normalized to unity .",
    "the ensemble value of the kinetic energy of the @xmath7-th particle belonging to a system of particles without exchange interaction is computed as : @xmath45 the kinetic energy operator is @xmath46 . hereafter ,",
    "unless specified , the spatial integrals are assumed to extend over the whole configuration space .",
    "the same expression can be used for identical particles defined from the wave function in .",
    "then , one can easily realize that @xmath47 for any @xmath7 and @xmath26 indexes . as expected",
    ", one can not discern between identical particles from the measurement of their kinetic energies .",
    "we compute the behavior of the total kinetic energy @xmath48 for three electrons ( with parallel spins ) with and without exchange interaction , as a function of the distance among the wave packets in the configuration space ( see inset in ) .",
    "we define the normalized phase - space distance among the central positions and central wave vectors of two wave packets as @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the wave vector dispersion .",
    "in , we plot , in a square ( black ) line , the mean value of the total kinetic energy of three electron ( fermions ) with exchange interaction , whose wave function is defined from .",
    "the result is repeated for different values of the distance @xmath51 with the condition @xmath52 and @xmath53 seen in the inset of .",
    "identically , we plot in up triangle ( blue ) line the total kinetic energy computed for three particles without exchange interaction , whose wave function is defined from . for large @xmath54 , the values of the kinetic energy of the three electrons with and without exchange interaction are identical . for such large values of @xmath54 ,",
    "all electrons are placed far away from each other in the phase - space and the exchange interaction has no effect . however ,",
    "this is not true for small values of @xmath54 .",
    "then , the difference between the kinetic energy of electrons with or without exchange interaction increases as we place the three electrons closer inside the phase - space .",
    "the result plotted in is just ( the wave packet version of ) the celebrated pauli exclusion principle : identical fermions can not be in the same quantum state .",
    "the discussion has been done with three particles , instead of two , because in [ appendix2 ] we generalize the present example to three electrons with exchange interaction and different spins orientations .      in bohmian mechanics @xcite ,",
    "each particle of the system is represented by a trajectory guided by a wave .",
    "the wave is the many - particle wave function discussed above , @xmath55 , with all its computational difficulties .",
    "such wave function satisfies the continuity equation , written in , that relates current and probability presence densities . from such continuity equation",
    ", one can easily define a ( bohmian ) velocity @xmath56 at each position of the configuration space as : @xmath57 the ( bohmian ) trajectory of the @xmath7-th particle , @xmath58 $ ] , in real space can be defined by time - integrating as : @xmath59=\\vec r_j^l[0]+\\int_{0}^{t }",
    "\\vec v^l_j(\\vec r_1^{l}[t\\rq{}], ... ,\\vec r_n^{l}[t\\rq{}],t\\rq { } ) dt\\rq{}. \\label{trajectory}\\ ] ] obviously , one has to select the initial position @xmath60 $ ] to perfectly specify the trajectory .",
    "the super - index @xmath61 on the trajectory accounts for the @xmath62 different initial positions that can be selected .",
    "we refer to @xmath58 $ ] as the bohmian trajectory in @xmath2 , while we will refer to @xmath63,",
    ".. ,\\vec r_n^l[t]\\}$ ] as a many - particle ( or @xmath1-particle ) bohmian trajectory in @xmath3 .    the relevant property of these bohmian trajectories that makes them meaningful for quantum computations is the fact that , by construction , a proper ensemble of them ( with different initial positions ) does exactly reproduce the time - evolution of the many - particle wave function , at any time .",
    "a proper ensemble means that the initial positions , @xmath64 ....",
    "\\vec r^{l}_{n}[0 ] \\}$ ] , are selected according to the probability distribution @xmath65 .",
    "this last condition is called quantum equilibrium hypothesis @xcite",
    ".    we can now deduce an important property of these trajectories that will be very relevant later . since @xmath55 is a single - valued wave function ,",
    "the bohmian velocity computed from in each point of the configuration space is unique .",
    "this means that if two trajectories coincide at some point of the configuration space , then , they will coincide forever ( because their velocities become identical ) .",
    "this well - known result can be summarized in a simple sentence : two many - particle bohmian trajectories ( with different initial positions ) do not cross in the configuration space , either for bosons , fermions or non - identical particles @xcite .",
    "equivalently , the presentation of such trajectories can be done by introducing the polar form of the many - particle wave function @xmath66 into .",
    "the modulus @xmath67 and the phase @xmath68 are real functions .",
    "then , one obtains again , from the imaginary part of , the continuity equation defined in ( [ continuity ] ) in polar form : @xmath69 where we recognize the velocity of the @xmath7-th particle as : @xmath70 by construction @xcite , the velocity definition in is identical to that in . on the other hand ,",
    "the real part of the schrdinger equation leads to a many - particle version of the quantum hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the potential in and we have defined the ( local ) bohmian kinetic energy as : @xmath73 and the ( local ) quantum potential energy : @xmath74 when dealing with bohmian trajectories , the ensemble kinetic energy defined in is divided into two parts , @xmath75 . the first part : @xmath76 related to the local ( bohmian ) kinetic energy @xmath77 , and the second part : @xmath78 to the quantum potential energy @xmath79 .",
    "now , we can list a series of important properties for those ensembles of bohmian trajectories that represents identical particles , i.e. , when exchange interaction is present . in order to simplify the notation ,",

    "as discussed for the wave function , the requirements in and are satisfied at any time @xmath30 .",

    "\\label{exchangevelo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this condition on the bohmian velocities , which is valid for either bosons or fermions , has two relevant consequences .",
    "first , let us compare the two sets of many - particle trajectory with different initial positions mentioned above : the @xmath86-set and the @xmath87-set .",
    "their difference are only @xmath83=\\vec r_h^f[0]$ ] and @xmath84=\\vec r_j^f[0]$ ] .",
    "then , we realize from that all bohmian trajectories with identical initial conditions will be equal independently of the initial conditions , except the two trajectories which have their initial positions interchanged . for these trajectories , we get @xmath58=\\vec r_h^f[t]$ ] and @xmath90=\\vec r_j^f[t]$ ] .",
    "the second consequence of is valid for those many - particle trajectories that have , at least , two equal components , i.e. @xmath83=\\vec r_h^l[0 ] \\equiv \\vec a$ ] . because of this coincidence",
    ", we have @xmath81=\\{.,\\vec a,.,\\vec a,.\\}$ ] and also @xmath82=\\{.,\\vec a,.,\\vec a,.\\}$ ] which in fact are the same .",
    "then , the condition @xmath91,t ) = \\vec v_h(\\vec x^f[t],t)$ ] can be written as : @xmath89,0)= \\vec v_h(\\vec x^l[t],0 ) \\equiv v_{a } , \\label{velodiagonal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because @xmath81=\\vec x^f[0]$ ] . then",
    ", the trajectory @xmath58 $ ] at the subsequent time @xmath92=\\vec",
    "a+\\vec v_a dt$ ] is identical to the other trajectory @xmath93=\\vec a+\\vec v_a dt$ ] .",
    "this result , means @xmath58=\\vec r_h^l[t]$ ] at any time .",
    "because of the previous property and the non - crossing property of bohmian trajectories discussed before @xcite , we have an important corollary .",
    "we define diagonal many - particle trajectories as those trajectories where at least two components , @xmath58=\\vec r_h^l[t]$ ] , are identical ( the rest of components can be different ) . since other bohmian trajectories can not cross such diagonal trajectories , all bohmian trajectories are restricted to remain in subspaces of the configuration space . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , bohmian mechanics for identical particles can be described in a `` reduced '' space @xmath94 , with @xmath95 the permutation space of @xmath96 particles .    finally , we want to mention that in bohmian computations , even with the symmetrization postulate , trajectories of particles are obviously distinguishable .",
    "one labels the trajectory of particle @xmath97 as @xmath98 $ ] and that of particle @xmath99 as @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "we have shown that , by construction , the bohmian trajectories have special symmetry requirements .",
    "then , all results for particle @xmath97 computed from an ensemble of these trajectories will be identical to those computed for particle @xmath99 . in simple words , for a system of identical particles , bohmian trajectories are distinguishable , while observable results associated to different particles become indistinguishable .",
    "let us discuss , with some numerical examples , the previous properties of bohmian trajectories of identical particles .",
    "in all the numerical examples of this subsection , we consider two free particles propagating , each one , in 1d physical space .",
    "the single - particle wave packets that will be used to construct the many - particle wave function at the initial time @xmath33 are defined from .",
    "first , we consider two electrons with a wave function @xmath101 computed from , without any symmetry .",
    "see the initial modulus of the 2-particle wave function in .",
    "in particular , we consider @xmath102 ev , @xmath103 nm and @xmath104 nm for the first wave packet , and @xmath105 ev , @xmath106 nm and @xmath107 nm for the second . in order to see the spatial interaction of the two particles ,",
    "the momentum of the first particle is negative and that of the second positive .",
    "we consider a free electron mass for both electrons .",
    "once we know @xmath101 , we compute the ( two - particle ) bohmian trajectory from with different initial positions .",
    "as seen in , they correspond to roughly parallel lines .                in",
    ", we see that the quantum potential of either the first or the second particles are nearly zero . the total quantum potential , as the sum of the two particles , is plotted in dashed square ( red ) line .",
    "the ensemble ( bohmian ) kinetic energy remains equal to its initial value , @xmath108 ev for the first wave packet in solid circle ( blue ) line and @xmath109 ev for the second in solid plus ( blue ) line .",
    "the total energy in solid ( green ) line remains constant and equal to @xmath110 ev , i.e. , the sum of kinetic energies .",
    "these simple bohmian trajectories for non - identical particles move roughly like classical particles .",
    "next , we consider a wave function @xmath101 of two identical electrons computed from the slater determinant of for @xmath111 .",
    "we use the same two initial gaussian wave packets discussed above . in ( a ) , we plot the ( symmetric ) modulus of the many - particle wave functions at @xmath112 fs . in particular , we get @xmath113 at any point @xmath114 of the diagonal . in ( a ) , we plot a set of bohmian trajectories .",
    "the initials positions @xmath115,x_2^l[0]\\}$ ] are selected symmetrically with respect to the diagonal .",
    "first , we observe that @xmath116=x_2^f[t]$ ] and @xmath117=x_1^f[t]$ ] when @xmath118=x_2^f[0]$ ] and @xmath119=x_1^f[0]$ ] .",
    "as discussed in , the bohmian trajectories corresponding to interchanged initial positions become symmetrical with respect to the diagonal points of the configuration space .",
    "second , we observe that the bohmian trajectories do not cross the diagonal .",
    "in ( a ) , we plot the energies of this two - particle fermion system .",
    "the total energy of the identical particles is equal to that of the particles without exchange interaction discussed in .",
    "the reason , as explained in , is because the momentum of the wave packets are very different .",
    "one momentum is positive and the other negative and no pauli effect is observed in the energy . however , since bohmian trajectories are `` reflected '' at the diagonal , their ( bohmian ) velocity becomes zero at that time .",
    "then , the ensemble average of @xmath120 in is almost zero , while the ensemble average of @xmath121 grows to keep the total energy constant .",
    "the same result can be argued by noting that the quantum potential in depends on the curvature of the modulus , which becomes large at that points .",
    "in addition , in contrast to the two particles without exchange interaction discussed in , the ( bohmian kinetic plus quantum ) energies of the first particle are identical to those of the second particle .",
    "the observable results of the energy of the individual particles are indistinguishable , while we can perfectly distinguish the trajectories in ( a ) .    finally , in ( b ) , ( b ) and ( b ) , we plot the same result as in the previous figures but considering two identical bosons .",
    "we use exactly the same parameters for the wave packets discussed in the previous figures .",
    "the only difference is that the initial wave function is computed from when the @xmath122 is substituted by @xmath97 .",
    "let us notice again the symmetric property of the modulus of the wave function in the configuration space .",
    "although we have @xmath123 at the diagonal points @xmath114 , we see in ( b ) , that bohmian trajectories do not cross that diagonal .",
    "this is an expected result because our discussions on the properties of bohmian trajectories in do not depend on the bosonic or fermionic nature of particles .",
    "there is a bohmian trajectory located along the diagonal points of the configuration space ( not plotted ) that does not allow to be crossed by other trajectories .",
    "the initials positions @xmath115,x_2^l[0]\\}$ ] are selected symmetrically with respect to the diagonal and identical to the ones used for the fermions .",
    "again , trajectories are symmetric under the exchange of initial positions . in ( b ) , we plot the energies of the two - particle bosonic system .",
    "the numerical results of the ( bohmian ) kinetic energy for bosons ( 0.019 ev ) are slightly lower than fermions ( 0.022 ev ) when the wave packet is close to the diagonal of the configuration space .",
    "the reason is because there are more bosonic bohmian trajectories that arrive closer to the diagonal in ( b ) and ( b ) than the fermionic ones in ( a ) and ( a ) .",
    "as commented in the introduction , many attempts have been developed in the literature to provide accurate solutions to the many - body problem . here",
    ", we briefly review one of this approximations presented by one of the authors in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , we explain how the exchange interaction can be included in the mentioned approximation .      the main idea behind the many - body approximation mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite is the fact that the computation of the bohmian velocity for the @xmath124 $ ] trajectory from only requires the spatial derivatives of @xmath125 on the @xmath126 directions , and not on the rest of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , in principle , the trajectory @xmath127 $ ] can be equivalently computed from the many - body wave function @xmath128 or from the following conditional wave function : @xmath129,t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath130=\\{\\vec{r}_{1}[t],\\vec{r}_{a-1}[t],\\vec{r}_{a+1}[t],\\vec{r}_{n}[t]\\}$ ] is a vector that contains all bohmian trajectories except @xmath127 $ ] .",
    "we also use @xmath131 when referring to all the degrees of freedom except @xmath126 .",
    "when not relevant , we avoid the superindex @xmath86 in the bohmian trajectory that specifies the initial positions of the trajectory .",
    "certainly , the conditional wave function in is defined in a much smaller configuration space , @xmath2 , than the many - body wave function .",
    "thus , in principle , the conditional wave function needs much less computational effort than the explicit many - particle wave function .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the single - particle wave function @xmath132 , that we will use to compute @xmath124 $ ] , can be obtained as a solution of the single - particle schrdinger equation : @xmath133,t)+g_{a}(\\vec{r}_{a},\\vec{x}_{a}[t],t)\\right . \\ ; \\nonumber \\\\ \\left.+",

    "the exact definition of the terms @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in brief",
    ", we have been able to decompose an irresolvable @xmath1-particle schrdinger equation into a set of @xmath1-single - particle schrdinger equation with time - dependent potentials @xcite . at this point",
    "we realize that the extraordinary numerical simplification comes at the prize that there are terms in which are unknown and need pertinent approximations , @xmath137,t)$ ] and @xmath138,t)$ ] .",
    "this is a similar situation to that in dft discussed in the introduction .",
    "next , in order to clarify the use of conditional ( bohmian ) trajectories discussed above , we applied it to a simple system of two electrons without exchange interaction under a non - separable hamiltonian .",
    "we consider two 1d particles so that the configuration space is @xmath139 .",
    "we use the non - separable potential energy : @xmath140 where the factor @xmath141 will allow us to modify arbitrarily the strength of the non - separable interaction .",
    "in particular , we will use @xmath142 .",
    "the many - body wave function @xmath143 can be solved exactly from with @xmath111 .",
    "once the exact 2d wave function @xmath143 is known , we can compute the exact 2d bohmian trajectories straightforwardly from .    in",
    ", we have plotted the ensemble results of the ( bohmian ) kinetic energy , , the quantum potential energy , , for the two electrons .",
    "we compute the results directly from the 2d exact wave function solution of .",
    "we emphasize that there is an interchange of kinetic energies between the first and second particles ( see their kinetic energy in the first and second oscillations ) .",
    "this effect clearly manifests that the hamiltonian of that quantum system is non - separable .",
    "alternatively , we can compute the trajectories used to compute without knowing the many - particle wave function , but computing the conditional wave function @xmath144 solution of with the proper approximation for terms @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "here , we consider a zero order taylor expansion around @xmath147 $ ] for the unknown potentials terms @xmath145 and @xmath146 . in other words , we consider them as purely time - dependent potential terms , @xmath148,t ) \\approx g_{a}^{''}(x_a[t],t)$ ] and @xmath149,t ) \\approx j_{a}^{''}(x_a[t],t)$ ] .",

    "we consider a set of free electrons moving under the influence of the coulomb and exchange interaction inside a device active region , when an external bias is applied between source and drain ( see ) .",
    "electrons are injected into the device with an arbitrary spin .",

    "alternatively , we can assume that the effect of the exchange interaction on the dynamics of an electron with spin up @xmath216 ( down @xmath217 ) is due only to the other electrons with spin up @xmath216 ( down @xmath217 ) .",

    "we only take into account the first energy of the subband of gaas with a value of @xmath231 ev just above the bottom of the conduction band .          in , we present the time - averaged current @xmath232 as a function of the external bias for four different scenarios : coulomb and exchange interactions ( cei ) , without exchange or coulomb interactions ( wi ) , with coulomb interaction alone ( ci ) and with exchange interaction alone ( ei ) .",
    "it is clear that the differences observed in the different curves are mainly a direct consequence of the coulomb interaction .",
    "somehow , for our particular device , the coulomb interaction screens the effect of the exchange interaction because most of the electrons ( not all ) are already repelled by the coulomb interaction .",
    "we emphasize that we are using coulomb interaction beyond mean field , with self - interaction correction @xcite .",
    "the presence of coulomb interaction tends to reduce the current because there are less electrons in the channel .",

    "electrons crossing the active region , @xmath246 and @xmath247 , are responsible for the dc ( i.e. zero frequency ) behavior . on the other hand , electrons that do not cross the device active region , @xmath248 and @xmath249",
    ", do not contribute to dc , but only to high - frequency dynamics .    at zero bias ,",
    "as seen in ( a ) , without interaction ( wi ) , half of electrons are transmitted from source to drain and half from drain to source .",
    "no reflected electrons .",

    "the ei simulation provides reflected electrons because of the effect seen in , that forbids electrons from occupying the same positions ( i.e. the diagonals points of the configuration space ) and some of the electrons are finally bounced .",
    "let us emphasize that the mean number of electrons in the active region of the quantum wire of can be very small . from the current in , we can compute the rate of transmitted electrons which is quite similar to their transit time .",
    "the ci ( and cei ) simulation shows reflected because of the coulomb repulsion among electrons .",
    "finally , we focus on set of plots @xmath244 ( from drain to drain ) in ( b ) . at a 0.05 v ,",
    "the ei simulation has a larger value @xmath244 than the others .",
    "this result does not implies a larger number of reflected particles with ei simulation , but only that these ei reflected particles spent more time inside the active region than , for example , the ci and cei ones .",
    "the reflection in the ei simulation occurs when the particles are really very close , see ( a ) , while the reflection in the ci simulation occurs for particles with a larger spatial separation .",
    "the coulomb interaction has a longer range than the particular ( exchange interaction ) effect seen in ( a ) .",

    "this result justifies again why the coulomb interaction , somehow , screens the possible effects of the exchange interaction .                       from the time - dependent current @xmath250 provided by the monte carlo _",
    "bitlles _ simulator we can also study the noise characteristics of this simple nano - resistor in a very simple way @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations of the current can be easily obtained from the autocorrelation function @xmath251 of the current fluctuations @xmath252 being @xmath250 the instantaneous current provided by the quantum monte carlo bitlles simulator and @xmath232 the time - average dc current computed above .",
    "the fourier transform of this autocorrelation function @xmath253 is the noise power spectral density of @xmath254 .",
    "finally , the fano factor , defined as the ratio @xmath255 with @xmath256 , can be computed .    in",
    "we show the noise power spectral density as a function of the frequency for four different bias .",
    "the fano factor decreases as we increase the voltage .",
    "since we are simulating at room temperature , for low bias tending to zero , the current tends to zero while the thermal noise is still present giving a fano factor tending to infinite . for high bias ,",
    "the fluctuations follows the binomial distribution that roughly tends to a poissonian one for electrons with energy above the fermi level ( as is the case for the sample with confinement discussed here ) .",
    "deviations from this behavior are due to correlations originated from coulomb and exchange interactions .",
    "first , we observe in that , similarly to dc , the the most important effect on the fano factor is due to the coulomb interaction ( see ci and cei in ) .",
    "as we see in ( d ) , the fano factor is lower than one with cei or ci simulations .",
    "it is well - known that the coulomb repulsion between electrons tends to space them more regularly rather than strictly at random , and to evidence a sub - poissonian statistics @xcite .",
    "however , we see that the small deviations between the cei and ci results are influenced by the exchange interaction present in the simulation box . when ei is larger than ci , the cei is larger than ci , and vice - verse .",
    "secondly , we observe that the effect of the exchange interaction in the noise is more important at low bias .",
    "this result has the same explanation that we explain in the previous and .",
    "thirdly , in ( b ) and ( c ) , at intermediate bias , we see a peak of the noise power spectral density above @xmath97thz",
    ". one can realize that this peak in the fluctuations appears when only wi or ei are considered .",
    "the origin of this peak is the increment of the number of reflected electrons because they can not occupy identical positions .",

    "this increment of reflected particles can be seen in ( b ) .",
