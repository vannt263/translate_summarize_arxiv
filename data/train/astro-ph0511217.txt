    "in connection with the activity of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , compact x - ray sources and inner engines of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , we consider accreting plasmas onto a black hole .",
    "the observed huge energy outputs are mainly originated from the gravitational energy released from infalling matters .",
    "when a black hole is rapidly rotating in an external magnetic field , we can also expect the release of the rotational energy of the black hole by the electromagnetic interaction between the black hole s spin and the magnetic field ( see @xcite in the force - free limit ; @xcite , hereafter tntt90 ; @xcite for ideal mhd flow ) . the global magnetic field around a black hole",
    "should be enhanced by infalling magnetized plasmas , and the magnetic field generated by the dynamo motion of the surrounding plasma can also interact with the spin of the black hole .",
    "the `` black hole magnetosphere '' system is composed of a rotating black hole , surrounding plasmas and magnetic fields , and considered as a central engine of agn and grb activities .",
    "it would output energy in the form of high - energy radiation ( x - rays and @xmath0-rays ) and highly - accelerated plasma outflows ( relativistic jets and winds ) . in both energy output processes ,",
    "the study of plasma behavior in the magnetosphere is the key to various problems .",
    "this situation is very similar to the activity of the solar magnetosphere ( i.e. , the emission of x - rays and the generation of solar wind ) . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the basic plasma physics of the vicinity very close to a black hole including the magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetosphere is assumed stationary and axisymmetric , and the ideal mhd approximation is assumed .",
    "then , the mhd plasmas stream along magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere , and five field aligned parameters exist ; that is , the total energy , total angular momentum , number flux per magnetic flux and entropy of the mhd flow , and the angular velocity of the magnetic field line ( see next section ) .",
    "the flows accelerated by gravity pass through magnetosonic points , where the poloidal component of the flow velocity becomes the magnetosonic wave speed . to fall into the black hole",
    ", the accreting plasma ejected from the plasma source with low - velocity must pass through the fast and slow magnetosonic points and the alfvn point , which are singular points in the basic equations .",
    "the physical flow solution along a magnetic field line is restricted by the regularity conditions at these singular points @xcite .",
    "that is , the conditions restrict the possible ranges of physical flow parameters .",
    "hereafter , we will discuss the mhd shock in accretion onto a black hole .",
    "relativistic mhd shocks are discussed by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we apply their formalism to a black hole magnetosphere in kerr spacetime ( for the slow magnetosonic shock , see @xcite , hereafter trft02 ; @xcite ) . the trans - magnetosonic accretion flow , which is ejected from a plasma source and passes though the first magnetosonic point , results in the shock on the way to the event horizon , and the postshock sub - magnetosonic flow passes through the second magnetosonic point ( located inside the shock front ) again . such a mhd shock accretion solution must satisfy the critical conditions at both the first and second magnetosonic points and the shock conditions .",
    "thus , we must adjust the five parameters of the flow to the physically acceptable shocked accretion solution with multiple magnetosonic points by considering both the critical conditions at the magnetosonic points and the jump conditions at the shock front .    in a plausible black hole magnetosphere ,",
    "global magnetic field lines are generated by the surrounding plasma ( e.g. , an equatorial disk and its corona ) .",
    "we expect that ( 1 ) the magnetic field lines shaped like loops would be distributed around the inner - edge region of the disk , ( 2 ) the disk surface and the black hole are connected by the magnetic field lines , where on the disk side of the field lines the footpoints can be anchored to the disk surface at the location of several times the inner - edge radii and on the black hole side the field lines can connect the event horizon from its pole to equator , and ( 3 ) the open magnetic field lines connecting the outer region of the disk surface are extended to distant regions @xcite .",
    "the ingoing ( or outgoing ) flow is ejected with non - zero velocity from the footpoint on the disk surface , which is a plasma source and is called the `` injection point '' . then , along the disk ",
    "black hole connecting magnetic field lines , the mhd ingoing flows fall into the black hole , while the outgoing winds would stream along the open magnetic field lines and the loop - like magnetic field lines would enclose static plasmas .",
    "( for a high accretion rate accretion disk system , the plasma can fall into the black hole radially from the disk s inner - edge . in this case , the loop - like configuration of the magnetic field lines would disappear . ) by considering the disk ",
    "black hole magnetic field lines , non - equatorial accretion flow that falls into the black hole from the high - latitude region is possible . if a mhd shock arises on the non - equatorial inflows and forms a very hot plasma region by the shock , we can expect high - energy emissions in the magnetosphere , which would be distinct from the emissions from the equatorial accretion disk .",
    "such high energy emissions from the hot plasma would directly ( or indirectly ) carry informations for the strong gravitational field to us . in our numerical demonstrations for mhd",
    "shocked ingoing flows , we should solve the realistic magnetic stream function @xcite for magnetic field lines connecting the disk and black hole .",
    "note that at the shock front magnetic field lines bend toward toroidal and/or poloidal directions .",
    "however , in general , it is hard to solve self - consistently the magnetic structure of the magnetosphere .",
    "so , for simplicity , without a realistic magnetic stream function , we would only discuss the ingoing trans - magnetosonic flows on a _ conical _ magnetic stream function .",
    "we assume that at the shock front the magnetic field lines bend only to the toroidal direction .",
    "this assumption would be valid near the black hole ( at least inside the inner - light surface ) .",
    "near the injection point , of course , the conical magnetic fields would not be realistic .",
    "this is because the conical magnetic field lines do not connect to the equatorial disk surface ; that is , we can not define the footpoints .",
    "( note that we can consider coronal gases distributed above the disk surface as a plasma source . in this case ,",
    "conical magnetic field may be probable . ) furthermore , in the demonstrations in  4 , we only treat the inflow streaming near the equatorial plane .",
    "however , we can expect that the qualitative picture is not drastically changed along the magnetic field lines ( 2 ) where we leave the equatorial region .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the general relativistic effects on the streaming mhd plasma in the black hole magnetosphere : trans - magnetosonic accretion and mhd shock formation .",
    "the accreting flow must be super - magnetosonic at the horizon , and the flow injected from the plasma source with low - velocity must pass through the magnetosonic points ( the slow magnetosonic point , the alfvn point , and fast magnetosonic point ) . in  2 , we present the general relativistic mhd flows .",
    "we introduce the field - aligned flow parameters and trans - magnetosonic solutions .",
    "the mhd shock formation is studied and the shocked accretion solutions are presented in  3 .",
    "we explore various types of shocked solutions .",
    "the properties of the mhd shock is discussed in  4 .",
    "we can obtain a very hot plasma region near the event horizon for the mhd shock of a high - energy inflow with small number density , where the energy conversion from the kinetic energy to the magnetic energy is restricted because of the black hole boundary conditions on the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in  5 .",

    "<S> fast and slow magnetosonic shock formation is presented for stationary and axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) accretion flows onto a black hole . the shocked black hole accretion solution must pass through magnetosonic points at some locations outside and inside the shock location . we analyze critical conditions at the magnetosonic points and the shock conditions . </S>",
    "<S> then , we show the restrictions on the flow parameters for strong shocks . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that a very hot shocked plasma is obtained for a very high - energy inflow with small number density . </S>",
    "<S> such a mhd shock can appear very close to the event horizon , and can be expected as a source of high - energy emissions . </S>",
    "<S> examples of shocked mhd accretion flows are presented in the schwarzschild case . </S>"
