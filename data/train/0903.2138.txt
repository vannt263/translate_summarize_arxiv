    "catastrophic changes in the coronal magnetic field topology are believed to trigger energetic transient events , such as , solar flares and cmes .",
    "the mhd catastrophe leads to the reconnection of magnetic field lines in the corona that results in a wealth of observed post - flare phenomena .",
    "as flares derive their energy from stressed magnetic field , it is expected that the magnetic stress or non - potentiality would relax toward a lower energy state after the release of excess energy available in the active region .",
    "it was first suggested several decades ago by that flare energy release should be associated with observable magnetic field changes .",
    "extensive efforts have been made since then to detect such changes using photospheric magnetic field measured by ground - based instruments @xcite , and more recently , by space - borne instruments @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of results have been reported on the pre- and post - flare changes in magnetic field parameters .",
    "however , these remained mostly unreliable because of poor sensitivity , spatial resolution , cadence and coverage of the available magnetographs .",
    "furthermore , serious questions have also been raised about the nature of observed magnetic field changes as these measurements are expected to be affected by flare - induced line profile changes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , with the availability of recent high - quality , high - cadence magnetic field observations , there is a mounting evidence of rapid , permanent changes in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields during the course of large flares @xcite .",
    "there are some other physical processes accompanying the sudden energy release occurring in the solar corona that may influence the magnetic field measurements . a large number of charged particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , electrons and protons , accelerated during the flare energy release in the corona can precipitate along magnetic field - lines and lose their energy in the lower atmosphere . during this process",
    ", microwave radiation is produced by gyrosynchrotron process and hard x - ray ( hxr ) emission through a thick - target bremsstrahlung process @xcite .",
    "white - light flares ( wlfs ) , the most energetic of all flares , were suggested to be associated with direct heating by nonthermal or accelerated particles , specifically quasi - relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "this is observationally supported by the hxr footpoints , _",
    "i.e. _ , sites of nonthermal particle acceleration , matching well with wlf ribbons @xcite .",
    "however , only very high energy electrons having energy exceeding a few mev are expected to penetrate to deeper photospheric layers due to the increasing density .",
    "only these high energy electrons can contribute to direct heating that may not be adequate to produce wlf emission .",
    "it was inferred from the trace wl and _ yohkoh_/hxt data that wlf ribbons originate in the chromosphere and the temperature minimum region , and that the enhanced wl emission is caused by ionization and subsequent recombination of hydrogen .",
    "energy thus deposited in the chromosphere by the electron beam is then transported to the lower atmosphere by a back - warming process . observed changes in magnetic field parameters during the impulsive phase of a flare would be affected by a variety of these effects .",
    "localized sign reversal of magnetic polarity , termed as `` magnetic anomaly '' , has been observed during the impulsive phase of some flares @xcite .",
    "such a sign reversal has also been attributed to the change in the spectral line profile , from absorption to emission , by numerical models @xcite . however , non - lte calculations for the spectral line ni  i 6768 , used for magnetic field measurements in gong and soho / mdi instruments , have shown that this absorption line can turn into emission only by a large increase of electron density and not by heating of the atmosphere by any other means .",
    "consistent with this , discovered sign reversals in locations of strong hxr emission formed near the cooler sunspot umbral / penumbral areas . injection and transport of high - energy electrons was observationally inferred from a m9.8 flare observed in microwave by owens valley solar array , and in hxr by hard x - ray telescope on board _ yohkoh _ @xcite .",
    "_   simulated the gong and mdi observations for solar flares and concluded that as compared to doppler velocity measurements the magnetic field measurements are less sensitive to the line shape changes .",
    "in addition , their numerical simulation also showed that the observed transient sign reversal may be produced when the ni  i 6768  line profile turns into emission as a result of non - thermal beam impact on the atmosphere in regions of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the effect of line profile changes on magnetic field estimates has been reported also by .",
    "more recently , flare - associated helioseismic effects have been reported using different local helioseismology techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ , detection of acoustic sources by holography @xcite , flare - induced seismic waves using time - distance analysis @xcite and post - flare amplitude enhancement of acoustic or p - modes by ring - diagram technique @xcite . have found seismic sources to be located near the acoustic sources discovered earlier by during the large flare in noaa 10486 .",
    "several other flare - productive regions have also been extensively studied .",
    "while examining the gong magnetogram movie of the x17/4b flare of 28 october 2003 in noaa 10486 , rapidly `` moving '' transient magnetic features ( mfs ) were detected during the impulsive phase @xcite .",
    "these interesting transient features moved away from the flare site with separation velocities ranging from 30 to 50 km s@xmath0 comparable to the velocity of seismic waves reported by .",
    "these mfs do not appear to be instrumental artifacts as gong and mdi movies both exhibited these features .",
    "the exact nature of the mfs is , however , not well understood and further investigations are required .",
    "if the mfs were indeed associated with the white - light flare by way of the absorption line profile turning into emission , they are expected to be correlated with wlf kernels . in particular",
    ", it would also be interesting to examine whether these features were essentially `` moving '' sign - reversal anomalies associated with hxr sources produced by nonthermal electron beams @xcite .",
    "it is to note that we also detected `` doppler velocity transients '' during the impulsive phase of this flare from gong and mdi dopplergram movies .",
    "these are similar to the localized doppler velocity enhancements , co - spatial with h@xmath1 flare kernels , earlier reported by .    in this paper , we discuss spatial and temporal correlations of the `` moving '' magnetic and doppler velocity transient features observed during the energetic white - light flares of 28 and 29 october 2003 .",
    "we examine the properties of these mfs in the light of recent studies related to flare - associated changes in magnetic and doppler velocity fields .",
    "we also attempt to find their correlation with flare kernels as observed in the lower atmosphere , _",
    "i.e. _ , photosphere and chromosphere and the corresponding features in upper layers using the available multi - wavelength observations . in section  [ s - data ] , we describe the observational data used in this study . the data analysis technique is given in section  [ s - analysis ] .",

    "the spatial and temporal resolutions of the constructed images are 4 arcsec and 1 min , respectively .",
    "we chose different energy bands for the two flares due to their differing energetics : higher energy ( 100 - 200 kev ) for the 28 october 2003 event and the lower energy ( 50 - 100 kev ) for the 29 october 2003 event .",
    "we have used time - series of full - disk gong and mdi magnetograms and dopplergrams for identifying various transient features during the course of evolution of the energetic flares of 28 and 29 october 2003  in noaa 10486 .",

    "however , it may be noted that found , for a white - light flare of 30 september 2002 , that motions of the continuum and hxr sources show similar trend .",
    "we observed moving transients and sign reversals of magnetic polarity at some locations of noaa 10486 during the impulsive phases of both the white - light flares of 28 and 29 october 2003 .",
    "comparatively fainter doppler transients were discernible along with magnetic transients during these flares .",
    "the magnetic and doppler transients were observed to be well correlated .",
    "sign reversals in magnetic polarity and doppler velocity also occurred at the locations of these moving transients .",
    "the two flares were quiet different in their energetics - the 28 october flare was x17/4b , while the 29 october flare was x10/2b .",
    "they occurred at topologically different locations within the active region .",
    "we have attempted to examine properties and relationship of the observed mfs and flare kernels in various atmospheric layers for the two events .",
    "there are some interesting questions related to these observed transients : what kind of physical process caused the moving magnetic and doppler velocity transients ?",
    "is there any relationship between moving transients , hxr sources and flare kernels ?    the gong and mdi instruments use the same spectral line , _ i.e. _ , ni  i 6768 , but different principles of observations ( harvey 2008 , private communication ) .",
    "nevertheless , the observed motions in magnetic , doppler velocity and intensity fields obtained from both instruments were similar in nature .",
    "sign reversals in magnetic and doppler velocity fields were detected by both instruments during the impulsive phases of the flares of 28 and 29 october 2003 .",
    "some of these transients occurred near the cooler umbral / penumbral sites in the active region noaa 10486 , but there were also several exceptions .    in the case of the x17/4b flare of 28 october 2003",
    ", we found that the two locations of magnetic transients were associated with sign reversals in magnetic polarity ( and doppler velocity ) .",
    "these features differed in their basic characteristics as follows : ( i ) the location of sign reversal that occurred in strong magnetic field of the leading ( negative ) umbra was nearly stationary .",
    "both hxr source and wlf kernel were associated with this feature .",
    "( ii ) the other location of sign reversal observed in the weak field area near the neutral line moved rapidly toward the following ( positive ) polarity umbra , and was better associated with hxr as compared to the wlf kernels .    on the other hand , magnetic and doppler transients observed on 29 october 2003 were nearly stationary during the course of the x10/2b flare .",
    "the locations of magnetic transients , where sign - reversal anomaly appeared , did not conform well with the hxr sources .",
    "interestingly , we observed a strong hxr source ( and wlf kernel ) in weak field region without corresponding sign reversal anomaly . on the other hand , there was a wlf kernel but no hxr source associated with the magnetic transient observed in strong field location of the positive polarity umbra .",
    "this is in contrast with the hxr - magnetic anomaly relation observed for the white - light flare of 28 october 2003 , and also in contradiction with the earlier suggestions of about the association of hxr sources with polarity sign reversal phenomenon .",
    "we found that magnetic / doppler transients generally followed the usual behavior of separation of flare kernels observed in two - ribbon flares .",
    "let us first discuss the motion of magnetic transients observed during the flare of 28 october 2003 .",
    "there was an interesting trend in maximum separation attained for the flare kernels observed in successively lower layers of solar atmosphere : the shortest , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10 mm at the transition layer as observed in uv 284  ( trace ) , increasing to @xmath11 mm at the chromosphere ( uso h@xmath1 ) and @xmath12 mm in the temperature minimum region and the photosphere ( uv 1600  trace , and gong & mdi photospheric data ) .",
    "this trend is consistent with the classical flare model of an expanding loop structure with footpoints anchored in the lower atmosphere .",
    "the hxr feature also showed separation of @xmath13 mm , _",
    "i.e. _ , nearly the same as the separation observed in chromospheric h@xmath1 .",
    "this is consistent with the formation of footpoint sources in the chromosphere or in the lower corona depending on the energy of particles .",
    "magnetic and doppler transients , on the other hand , showed a larger separation of @xmath14 mm which matched the separation obtained for the photospheric wlf kernels .",
    "furthermore , we found that flare kernels separated faster in the lower atmosphere ( the temperature minimum region and the photosphere ) with velocity of 45 - 50 km s@xmath0 as compared to that in the upper atmosphere , _",
    "i.e. _ , 38 km s@xmath0 at the chromosphere , and 29 km s@xmath0 at the even higher transition region .",
    "however , separation velocities for the x10/2b flare of 29 october 2003 were found to be much smaller as compared to the x17/4b flare of the previous day .",
    ", using an atmospheric model , showed that spectral line inversion occurs near sunspot penumbral area if electron density rises significantly .",
    "it is to note that a rise in the electron density was found during the impulsive phase of the flare of 28 october 2003 @xcite , also consistent with the rhessi hxr observations .",
    "therefore , occurrence of moving transients appears to be related to line profile changes due to the process associated with electron - beams and not due to real changes in photospheric magnetic and doppler fields .",
    "however , no clear conclusions are discernible in the case of the x10/2b flare of 29 october 2003 . also , away from these features ,",
    "permanent changes in magnetic fluxes from the pre- to post - flare phases have been reported that do not seem to be affected by the wlf or hxr related effects @xcite .    from a study of",
    "the flare of 29 september 2002 , found that the continuum enhancement at hxr footpoints is not proportional to the electron beam flux , but it depends on the atmospheric conditions . using h@xmath1 line profiles they explained that the atmosphere was heated considerably during the impulsive phase , which increased the coronal pressure preventing nonthermal electrons from effectively penetrating into the chromosphere .",
    "but during the preflare phase the heating is low that allows an electron beam to easily penetrate into the chromosphere and produce the continuum enhancement via radiative back - warming effect .",
    "it is interesting to note that the observed flare kernels and moving transients associated with these events possessed large velocities .",
    "this is expected due to the large magnetic energy stored in the magnetically complex active region which produced these exceptionally energetic super - flares .",
    "large separation velocities of flare - ribbons and hxr footpoints are the signatures of rapid reconnection of successive magnetic field lines at higher levels of corona .",
    "finally , answer to the question of association characteristics of the moving magnetic transients ( or magnetic anomaly ) still remains ambiguous as a clear and consistent correlation of these features with hxr sources ( or wlf kernels ) did not emerge from the study of the two white - light flares of noaa 10486 .",
