    "this is well below the instrumental profile broadening of our data , which is about 15kms@xmath4  based on one pixel resolution , and is also smaller than the minimum detectable rotation from our data ( see below ) . as a result",
    ", vb10 can be considered a non - rotator in our study , and has been employed as a template to obtain rotational velocities of the m- and l - type targets .",
    "the cross - correlation technique assumes that the target and template spectra are of similar type and differ only in the rotation velocity .",
    "nevertheless , bailer - jones @xcite has recently shown that m - type templates can also yield accurate rotation velocities of l dwarfs . in our sample ,",
    "the energy distribution of t dwarfs do differ significantly from m dwarfs , and we found that for the t - type targets the cross - correlation with vb10 gives reasonable results if resonance lines of ki are avoided and only molecular ( particularly water vapor ) lines are used in the cross - correlation .",
    "the cool brown dwarf j1346@xmath900 ( t6.5v ) turns out to have a low value of @xmath0sin@xmath1  ( because of the unknown inclination angle of the rotation axis , we can not establish whether j1346@xmath900 is a true fast or slow rotator .",
    "however , we used it as a `` slow rotator '' in our study ) . from the data we can impose an upper limit of 15 kms@xmath4  on its projected rotational velocity .",
    "we used j1346@xmath900 as a secondary template to measure rotational broadening of the coolest objects in our sample , the late - l and t - type dwarfs .",

    "we also give their previously derived projected rotational velocities in column  5 of table  [ vrotdata ] . with the only exception of j0036@xmath1018 ( see below ) , our measurements and the values from the literature agree within the expected errors .",

    "the data of j1624@xmath1000 were shifted in velocity to match the template . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the spectrum of j1346@xmath900 broadened at the ( roughly ) rotation velocity of j1624@xmath1000 is also shown at the bottom of the figure .",

    "the cross - correlation technique suggests that the m9-dwarf rotates at a speed of 8.5@xmath162.6 kms@xmath4 .",
    "however , this measurement is below the minimum detectable projected rotational velocity of our study , which we estimate at about 10.5  kms@xmath4  after the discussion by bailer - jones @xcite .",
    "therefore , the adoption of the mean nirspec instrumental broadening as the upper limit on the @xmath0sin@xmath1  for the slowest rotators in our sample is conservative",

    "the fastest rotating young brown dwarfs with masses in the interval 5072  @xmath2 , periods below 10h , and @xmath19@xmath1745  kms@xmath4  ( note the drop of sin@xmath1 ) pose a problem to theory ( scholz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . relying on actual models , these rapid",
    ", massive substellar rotators would reach the spherical breakup velocity in less than the lifetime of the galaxy unless they brake down dramatically .",
    "it is expected that fast rotation impacts the evolution of brown dwarfs .",
    "these objects have rather neutral atmospheres ( low conductivity ) and despite the fact they can hold some long - lived magnetic fields up to a few gyr ( berger et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) , the atmospheric fluid motions and the field are likely decoupled , which reduces the `` magnetic '' activity . the mechanisms through which ultracool ( particularly the l and t types ) , fully convective rotators can lose angular momentum are to be determined ( magnetic braking , frictional heating , etc .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that young massive brown dwarfs of mid- to late - m spectral classes are warm enough to have coronae in a similar manner than low - mass stars ( see , e.g. , preibisch & zinnecker @xcite ; mokler & stelzer @xcite ; bouy @xcite ; preibisch et al .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this could in principle provide a braking mechanism but at a time when the brown dwarfs have not yet fully contracted and have not cooled down significantly . because there is no obvious braking between the pleiades and field brown dwarfs ( fig .",
    "[ vrot_age ] ) , it might be possible that these objects spin up due to contraction and brake down while still being warm ( and very young ) , and once they evolve to cooler temperatures the braking time becomes longer .",
    "very recently , reiners & basri @xcite report on the high @xmath0sin@xmath1  of an halo l - dwarf , suggesting that braking is even inexistent ( provided the object has an `` halo '' age ) . additionally , flare activity , like the one reported in a few field l dwarfs ( e.g. , liebert et al .",
    "@xcite ) can also shed off angular momentum .",
    "nevertheless , the frequency of strong flares in cool objects is quite low ( @xmath37% , gizis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , so their contribution to the rotation braking is expected to be small .",
    "finally , we point out that there can be a diversity of angular momentum histories in our sample of brown dwarfs ; some could be binaries , some may have flares , etc .",
    "we obtained high - resolution ( @xmath14@xmath71780022700 ) , near - infrared ( 1.1481.346@xmath13 m ) spectra of a sample of 19 ultracool dwarfs ( m6.5t8 ) using the nirspec instrument and the 10-m keck ii telescope .",
    "our sample comprises two late - m dwarfs , two young ( 100500myr ) brown dwarfs and fifteen l3.5t8 likely brown dwarfs of the solar neighborhood . projected rotation velocities ( @xmath0sin@xmath1 )",
    "were measured via a cross - correlation of the data against spectra of slow - rotating dwarf templates of similar types , which were observed with the same instrumental configuration .",
    "the star vb10 ( m8v ) and the brown dwarf j1346@xmath900 ( t6.5v ) were the templates .",
    "we found that , in general , the t - type brown dwarfs are relatively fast rotators , as are also the l dwarfs , with @xmath0sin@xmath1  spanning the range @xmath31540  kms@xmath4 . assuming a radius of 0.080.1@xmath5 , we placed an upper limit of 12.5h on the equatorial rotation of t dwarfs .",
    "rotation appears to correlate with spectral type ( from m to t class ) , @xmath0sin@xmath1  increasing towards later types .",
    "however , we found no clear evidence for t dwarfs rotating significantly faster than l dwarfs .",
    "we compared our @xmath0sin@xmath1  measurements to photometric periods of four l dwarfs reported in the literature , and concluded that the 3-h periodic radio emission of j0036@xmath1018 ( berger et al .",
    "@xcite ) is likely the true rotation period of the object .",
    "however , the derived photometric periodicities of j0255@xmath947 ( 5.2h , koen @xcite ) , j0539@xmath900 ( 13.3h , bailer - jones & mundt @xcite ) , and j2224@xmath901 ( 21.8h , gelino et al .",
    "@xcite ) seem too long to be considered the rotation periods if we assume a radius of 0.09@xmath5 .",
    "we also compared our data to @xmath0sin@xmath1  measurements of brown dwarfs of similar mass ( 3072  @xmath2 ) , which are confirmed members of very young star - forming regions and star clusters ( 110myr ) .",
    "a significant fraction of the very young brown dwarfs show @xmath0sin@xmath1  @xmath3  10 kms@xmath4 , which contrasts with the high values found in field brown dwarfs .",
    "this supports the fact that brown dwarfs spin up with age due to gravitational contraction . from the calculation of the hydrostatic contraction based on radii predictions of state - of - the - art evolutionary models ,",
    "we conclude that brown dwarfs seem to brake down from 1myr to the age of the solar neighborhood , and hence , they lose some angular momentum .",
    "however , massive brown dwarfs do not appear to brake down as dramatically as solar - type to early - m stars , suggesting that their spin - down time is significantly longer .",

    "<S> there are two young brown dwarfs , two likely field stars , and fifteen likely brown dwarfs ( 3072@xmath2 ) of the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the t - type dwarfs are fast rotators in marked contrast to m - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived @xmath0sin@xmath1  velocities between @xmath315 and 40  kms@xmath4   for them , and have found no clear evidence for t dwarfs rotating strongly faster than l dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a hint for an increasing lower envelope on moving from mid - m to the l spectral types in the @xmath0sin@xmath1spectral type diagram that was previously reported in the literature ; our @xmath0sin@xmath1  results extend it to even cooler types . assuming that field brown dwarfs have a size of 0.080.1  @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , we can place an upper limit of 12.5 h on the equatorial rotation period of t - type brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have compared our @xmath0sin@xmath1  measurements to spectroscopic rotational velocities of very young brown dwarfs of similar mass available in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison , although model - dependent , suggests that brown dwarfs lose some angular momentum during their contraction ; however , their spin down time seems to be significantly longer than that of solar - type to early - m stars . </S>"
