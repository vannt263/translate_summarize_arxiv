    "most observed charge - symmetry - breaking ( csb ) effects can be explained as being due to the differences in the masses ( qmd ) and electric charges of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks @xcite .",
    "these differences are manifested by the mass splitting in hadronic isospin multiplets and in the values of the @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath8-@xmath9 mixing amplitudes within meson - exchange potentials @xcite .",
    "the qmd leads to a difference in the masses of the neutron and proton and many other hadrons , and to a difference between the neutron - neutron ( @xmath10 ) and proton - proton ( @xmath11 ) @xmath0 scattering lengths , @xmath12-@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "therefore , an experimental determination of the scattering length difference , @xmath14 , gives a direct measure of csb and can be related to the qmd .",
    "this high sensitivity of the scattering lengths to details of the nuclear force at the quark level also is reflected in nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential models that are based on meson - exchange phenomenology .",
    "for example , for most realistic nn potential models , a 1% change in the potential strength results in a 30% shift in the value of the calculated scattering length .",
    "this enormous sensitivity of the nn scattering length to the potential strength can be understood to first order using effective range phenomenology . for a square",
    "well potential , the fractional change in the scattering length due to a small change in the potential depth is given by    @xmath15    using typical values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , implies that a 1% change in the depth of the square well potential will result in about a 10% shift in the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath13 has been measured directly to high precision ( of order 0.01 fm ) using two - nucleon scattering . however , there is a relatively large uncertainty of about @xmath18 in correcting the measured value of @xmath13 for electromagnetic ( _ em _ ) effects , which are sizeable for this parameter .",
    "consequently , the main uncertainty in determining the nuclear part of @xmath13 is due to the theoretical uncertainties in the factors used to relate the measured value of @xmath13 , which includes all _ em _ effects , to the purely nuclear part of the scattering length .",
    "the situation is quite different for @xmath1 . for technical reasons",
    "direct measurements of @xmath1 using free neutrons have never been successfully executed . up to now , all determinations for @xmath1 have been based on studies of reactions with at least three particles in the exit channel @xcite . in this paper , the results from measurements of neutron - deuteron ( _ nd _ ) breakup and pion - deuteron ( @xmath19 ) capture are reviewed .",
    "studies using these reactions were chosen for review because historically they have provided the most trusted determinations of @xmath1 .",
    "after the review of two recent kinematically complete _ nd _ breakup measurements , some concluding remarks are made and a list of recommended next steps presented .",
    "in this section the results for @xmath1 are summarized for studies done using _ nd _ breakup and @xmath19 capture measurements .",
    "this review will cover only experiments reported between 1964 and the present . in all cases @xmath1",
    "was determined by fitting the measured cross section for the _ nn _ final - state interaction ( fsi ) , which has a maximum value when the relative momentum of the two interacting neutrons is nearly zero . in the data analysis of these experiments ,",
    "the relative energy between the two neutrons was typically between 0 and 500  kev .",
    "this wide integration range was required to obtain sufficient statistical accuracy in the @xmath1 determination . a graphical summary of the situation is shown in fig .  [ fig : ann_summary ] .",
    "the graph is divided into three sections .",
    "the left most section contains the results from cross - section measurements of kinematically incomplete _ nd _ breakup experiments .",
    "five of the experiments reanalyzed by tornow _",
    "_ @xcite using modern theory are displayed as open circles .",
    "the middle section contains results from kinematically complete _ nd _ breakup experiments .",
    "the results from @xmath19 capture measurements are in the right section .",
    "the solid line represents the stastically weighted average of the data points for each reaction type from 1964 through 1997 .",
    "the dashed line in the left section is the average of the reanalyzed data .     from experiments reported between 1964 and the present .",
    "the data points for each reaction type are plotted on the horizontal axis in nearly chronological order and are as listed in tables  [ tab : ndbu ] and [ tab : pi_d ] .",
    "five of the experiments reanalyzed by tornow _",
    "@xcite are shown as open circles .",
    "the average values given at the tops of the sections for kinematically complete _ nd _ breakup measurements and the @xmath19 capture experiments do nt include the results reported since 1997 .",
    "the second average value in the left section is for the values obtained in the reanalysis @xcite.,width=566 ]    some details of the experiments from which the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : ann_summary ] are taken are given in the tables in this section .",
    "each experiment is categorized according to the number of kinematic quantities measured .",
    "the two broad types of experiments are kinematically complete ( kc ) and kinematically incomplete ( ki ) . the experiments are tagged according to the number of measured kinematic parameters , because the level of the kinematic contraints imposed in the experiment can significantly impact the signal - to - background in the measurement and the theory used in the data analysis .",
    ".survey of _ nd _ breakup cross - section measurements that were used to determine @xmath1 .",
    "the survey covers the period between 1964 and the present .",
    "the main features of the analyses are given in table  [ tab : details ] . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      +    in ki measurements of the @xmath20 reaction only the energy of the @xmath21-ray ( @xmath22 ) is measured .",
    "the measured @xmath22 spectrum is fit with theory to determine a value of @xmath1 . in the kc meaurements ,",
    "the momenta of the @xmath21-rays and one of the neutrons are measured for each detected capture event .",
    "the time - of - flight ( tof ) spectrum of the detected neutron is fit to determine @xmath1",
    ". the main experimental effects that must be taken into account when fitting the neutron tof spectrum are the energy dependence of the neutron detection efficiency , the energy dependence of the attenuation and scattering of neutrons in the liquid deutrium target and the surrounding materials .",
    "the results from the two most recent kc experiments are in agreement within the reported uncertainties , which include a @xmath230.3  fm due to theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the most popularly accepted value for @xmath1 comes from the @xmath19 capture measurements .",
    "the general belief is that these results are more reliable than those obtained from _ nd _ breakup or from other reactions in which there are three or more hadrons in the exit channel .",
    "this supposition is supported by the observation that the @xmath1 values obtained in the most recent high - precision @xmath19 experiments are in agreement while recent _ nd _ breakup experiments and analyses give discrepant results .",
    "therefore , the recommended value for @xmath1 obtained using indirect methods is -18.6 @xmath230.3 ( experimental ) @xmath230.3 ( theory ) fm .",
    "an important next step is to conduct _ nd _ breakup experiments for the purpose of resolving the discrepancies between the results from recent kc _ nd _ breakup experiments and for determining the cause of the shift in the value of @xmath1 in the reanalysis of the ki _ nd _ breakup cross - section data . while it is unclear whether investigating these problems will lead to a better determination of @xmath1 ,",
    "this work will almost certainly strenghten our understanding of three - nucleon reaction dynamics in the kinematic region around the _ nn _ fsi .",
    "the next sufficient step in this problem would be a direct measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "the high thermal neutron flux at the yaguar pulsed reactor in russia opens opportunties for such measurements .",
    "the dianna collaboration is planning the first direct measurement of @xmath1 that use neutrons from a reactor .",
    "some details of their proposed experiment are given in these proceedings .",
