    "ime - domain simulation is an important approach for power system dynamic analysis .",
    "however , the complete system model , or interchangeably the long - term stability model , typically includes different components where each component requires several differential and algebraic equations ( dae ) to represent , at the same time , these dynamics involve different time scales from millisecond to minute . as a result",
    ", the total number of dae of a real power system can be formidably large and complex such that time domain simulation over long time intervals is expensive@xcite .",
    "these constraints are even more stringent in the context of on - line stability assessment .",
    "intense efforts have been made to accelerate the simulation of long - term stability model .",
    "one approach is to use a larger time step size to filter out the fast dynamics or use automatic adjustment of step size according to system behavior in time - domain simulation @xcite@xcite@xcite from the aspect of numerical method .",
    "another approach is to implement the quasi steady - state ( qss ) model in long - term stability analysis @xcite@xcite from the aspect of model approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the qss model suffers from numerical difficulties when the model gets close to singularities which were addressed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , the qss model can not provide correct approximations of the long - term stability model consistently as numerical examples shown in @xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition , sufficient conditions of the qss model were developed in @xcite which pointed to a direction to improve the qss model . as a result",
    ", the qss model requires improvements in both model development and numerical implementation .",
    "this paper contributes to the latter one . in this paper",
    ", we apply pseudo - transient continuation ( @xmath0 ) which is a theoretical - based numerical method in power system long - term stability analysis .",
    "pseudo - transient continuation method can be implemented directly in the long - term stability model to accelerate simulation speed compared with conventional implicit integration method . on the other hand",
    ", the method can also be applied in the qss model to overcome possible numerical difficulties due to good stability property .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sectiondyptc ] briefly reviews general pseudo - transient continuation method in dae system .",
    "section [ sectionptcinpowersystem ] includes a introduction about power system models followed by implementation of pseudo - transient continuation method in the long - term stability model and the qss model respectively .",
    "section [ sectionnumerical ] presents three numerical examples to show the feasibility of the method . and",
    "conclusions are stated in section [ sectionconclusion ] .",
    "pseudo - transient continuation is a physically - motivated method and can be used in temporal integration .",
    "the method follows the solution of dynamical system accurately in early stages until the steady state is approaching .",
    "the time step is thereafter increased by sacrificing temporal accuracy to gain rapid convergence to steady state @xcite .",
    "if only the steady state of a dynamical system instead of intermediate trajectories is of interest , pseudo - transient continuation method is a better choice than accurate step - by - step integration . on the other hand ,",
    "compared with methods that solve nonlinear equations for steady state such as line - search and trust region methods , pseudo - transient continuation method can avoid converging to nonphysical solutions or stagnating when the jacobian matrix is singular .",
    "this is particularly the case when the system has complex features such as discontinuities which exist in power system models .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 method can be regarded as a middle ground between integrating accurately and calculating the steady state directly .",
    "@xmath0 method can help reach the steady state quickly while maintain good accuracy for the intermittent trajectories .",
    "for ode dynamics , sufficient conditions for convergence of @xmath0 were given in @xcite .",
    "the results were further extended the semi - explicit index - one dae system in @xcite .",
    "we recall the basic algorithm here .",
    "we consider the following semi - explicit index - one dae system : @xmath1 with initial value @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5^t \\in \\re^{n_1+n_2}$ ] , and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a nonsingular scaling matrix .",
    "we assume the initial condition for ( [ dae ] ) is consistent , i.e. @xmath8 and seek to find the equilibrium point @xmath9 such that @xmath10 and satisfies @xmath11 .    as stated before , the step - by - step integration is too time consuming if the intermediate states are not of interest . on the other hand ,",
    "newton s method for @xmath12 alone usually fails as the initial condition is not sufficiently near the equilibrium point .",
    "the @xmath0 procedure is defined by the iteration : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is adjusted to efficiently find @xmath9 rather than to enforce temporal accuracy .",
    "the convergence results in @xcite@xcite assume that the time step is updated with `` switched evolution relaxation''(ser ) : @xmath15    the algorithm is shown as below :    set @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "evaluate @xmath18 .    while @xmath19 is too large .",
    "solve @xmath20 .",
    "set @xmath21 .",
    "evaluate @xmath18 .",
    "update @xmath22 according to ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "step 2.a is a newton step which is typically solved by an iterative method which terminates on small linear residuals while it may also be solved by inexact newton iteration .",
    "note that the failure of @xmath0 usually can be well signaled by reaching the bound on the total number of iterations @xcite .",
    "the convergence of @xmath0 for smooth @xmath23 was proved in @xcite under the assumptions that the dae has index one in a certain uniform sense , that it has a global solution in time , and that the solution converges to a steady state .",
    "the result were further extended to nonsmooth @xmath23 in @xcite with @xmath24 in ( [ ptc ] ) replaced by a generalized derivative .",
    "next we explain why @xmath0 has a better stability property .",
    "firstly , conventional integration methods insist on a small norm of the linear residual at each step and will either converge , diverge to infinity , or stagnate at a point where iteration matrix is singular .",
    "however , @xmath0 method will accept an increase in the residual , responding to that increase by decreasing @xmath22@xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 stems from backward euler method which is an attractive choice when stability is the desired property instead of accuracy .",
    "one may think of @xmath0 method as a predictor - corrector method where the simple predictor is from previous time step and the corrector is backward euler with newton iteration @xcite . to see this , consider the implicit euler step from @xmath25 with @xmath26 , @xmath27 thus , @xmath28 is the root of the following equation : @xmath29 the newton s method to find the root of the above equation is : @xmath30 if we take @xmath31 , then by binomial inverse theorem , the first newton iterate is : @xmath32 which is exactly @xmath0 step .",
    "as @xmath0 method has a better stability property , it can be applied in the qss model when conventional integration method fails to converge .",
    "in this section , we firstly introduce power system models in long - term stability analysis .",
    "then we apply @xmath0 method to the long - term stability model with modifications .",
    "finally , we present an algorithm of @xmath0 method in the qss model to overcome possible numerical difficulties .      the long - term stability model for calculating system dynamic response relative to a disturbance can be described as : @xmath33    equation ( [ algebraic eqn ] ) describes the transmission system and the internal static behaviors of passive devices , and ( [ fast ode ] ) describes the internal dynamics of devices such as generators , their associated control systems , certain loads , and other dynamically modeled components . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are continuous functions , and vector @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the corresponding short - term state variables and algebraic variables . besides , equations ( [ slow ode ] ) and ( [ slow dde ] ) describe long - term dynamics including exponential recovery load , turbine governor , load tap changer ( ltc ) , over excitation limiter ( oxl ) , etc . @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the continuous and discrete long - term state variables respectively , and @xmath40 is the maximum time constant among devices .",
    "note that shunt compensation switching and ltc operation are typical discrete events captured by ( [ slow dde ] ) and @xmath41 is shunt susceptance and the transformer ratio correspondingly .",
    "transitions of @xmath41 depend on system variables , thus @xmath41 change values from @xmath42 to @xmath43 at distinct times @xmath44 where @xmath45 , otherwise , these variables remain constants . since short - term dynamics have much smaller time constants compared with those of long - term dynamics , @xmath46 and @xmath41 are also termed as slow state variables , and @xmath47 are termed as fast state variables .    if we represent the long - term stability model and the qss model in @xmath48 time scale , where @xmath49 , and we denote @xmath50 as @xmath51 , then the long - term stability model of power system can be represented as : @xmath52 where the study region @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .    at the same time , the qss model can be represented as : @xmath58 moreover , the long - term stability model ( [ complete ] ) can be regarded as two decoupled systems ( [ couple1 ] ) and ( [ couple2 ] ) showed as below when @xmath41 jump from @xmath42 to @xmath43 : @xmath59 and @xmath60 discrete variables @xmath41 are updated first and then system ( [ couple2 ] ) works with fixed parameters @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath41 jump from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , the qss model ( [ qss ] ) can be decoupled as : @xmath61 and @xmath62      assuming @xmath63 is nonsingular , then the long - term stability model ( [ couple2 ] ) with @xmath41 fixed as parameters is a semi - explicit index-1 dae system .",
    "@xmath0 method requires initial condition to satisfy the algebraic equations , however , the discrete equation ( [ couple1 ] ) will violate this condition whenever it works . as a result",
    ", we need to modify the original @xmath0 method for its implementation in long - term stability model .",

    "moreover , @xmath0 method is implemented for the post - fault system starting from @xmath70several seconds after the contingency . in examples of this paper",

    "for instance , if implicit trapezoidal method is used , then @xmath83 @xmath84      assuming @xmath85 is nonsingular , then the qss model ( [ coupleqss2 ] ) with @xmath41 fixed as parameters is a semi - explicit index-1 dae system .",

    "if implicit trapezoidal method is used , then @xmath89 @xmath90",
    "in this section , three examples are to be presented .",
    "the first two examples were the same 145-bus system in which the qss model met numerical difficulties during simulation while the long - term stability model was stable in long - term time scale .",
    "firstly , @xmath0 method was implemented in the long - term stability model and the speed was more than 7 times faster than the trapezoidal method . secondly ,",
    "when the qss model by trapezoidal method met difficulty , @xmath0 method was implemented in the qss model and provided correct approximations and the speed was still more than 5 times faster than the long - term stability model by trapezoidal method . and in the last example which was a 14-bus system , the long - term stability model was unstable and @xmath0 method successfully captured the instability which was signaled by reaching the bound of maximum iteration in the newton step .",
    "all simulations were done in psat-2.1.6@xcite .",
    "the system was a 145-bus system @xcite .",
    "there were exciters and power system stabilizers for each of generator 1 - 20 .",
    "and there were turbine governors for each of generator 30 - 40 .",
    "besides , there were three load tap changers at lines between bus 73 - 74 , bus 73 - 81 and bus 90 - 92 respectively .",
    "the contingency was a line loss between bus 1 - 6 . in this case , the post - fault system was stable after the contingency in the long - term time scale and it took 122.39s for the time domain simulation of the long - term stability model by implicit trapezoidal method .",
    "however , @xmath0 method only took 16.12s for the simulation of the long - term stability model which was about @xmath91 of the time consumed by trapezoidal method .",
    "[ tdsptc ] shows that the trajectories by @xmath0 method followed closely to the trajectories by trapezoidal method , and finally both converged to the same long - term stable equilibrium point .",
