    "the fenchel - nielsen twist is one of the most fundamental tools in studying the deformation space of a hyperbolic surface @xmath2 , equivalently the teichmueller space @xmath4 .",
    "geometrically it can be described as cutting the surface along a simple closed geodesic , do a twist of some length @xmath5 and then glue back .",
    "however these deformations can also be described algebraically and perhaps more naturally so .",
    "that is the point of view of this paper : we will define a type of algebraic deformations of representations @xmath6 where @xmath1 is an arbitrary lie group and @xmath2 is a manifold with contractible universal cover .",
    "it turns out that many geometric deformations are special cases of this construction if we consider only the holonomy representation , for example , bending a quasifuchsian surface group defined by thurston @xcite , johnson - millson bending @xcite , the twist - bulge deformation of a convex real projective surface by goldman @xcite , etc .",
    "interestingly , the starting representation @xmath7 from which we deform need not be discrete .",
    "let @xmath2 be an oriented surface of genus @xmath8 and @xmath9 a directed simple closed curve , this is the case of most interest to us even though our construction applies more generally to aspherical manifolds of higher dimensions with two - sided aspherical hypersurfaces . let @xmath6 be faithful , and suppose that the centralizer @xmath10 is non - trivial .",
    "for each lift @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 ) of @xmath13 in the universal cover @xmath14 , we assign a transformation @xmath15 in the @xmath1-centralizer of the @xmath7-image of the cyclic subgroup of @xmath16 which preserve @xmath11 under deck transformation .",
    "this assignment of @xmath15 also has to satisfy a condition of equivariance , which means that the choice of @xmath17 for @xmath18 determines the rest of the @xmath15 s .",
    "fix a base point @xmath19 , our construction can be informally described as follows .",
    "given @xmath20 , we consider a directed path from @xmath21 to @xmath22 where @xmath22 is the image of @xmath21 under the right - action of deck transformations .",
    "this path will cross an ordered collection of lifts @xmath23 , we can define a new function @xmath24 such that : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the intersection sign between @xmath11 and the path from @xmath21 .",
    "in fact the result does not depend on the particular path from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , as long as this path intersects @xmath11 transversely .",
    "we can then show that the resulting map @xmath24 is indeed a homomorphism .",
    "thus for example , when @xmath27 and @xmath7 a holonomy representation of a hyperbolic surface , we can choose @xmath15 inside a 1-parameter group of hyperbolic transformations and obtain a 1-parameter family of representations corresponding to the fenchel - nielsen twists .    in section [ sec : multi - hyp ]",
    "we generalize the above construction to multi - curves on surfaces ( and multi - hypersurfaces on manifolds ) .",
    "we will also prove a commutativity result , theorem [ thm : commute ] , which we will state below .",
    "let @xmath28 be a multi - hypersurface , or a union of disjoint hypersurfaces on @xmath2 , satisfying generic conditions .",
    "suppose that for each component @xmath29 of lifts of @xmath28 we have @xmath15 and @xmath30 chosen equivariantly such that the deformations @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be defined .",
    "then    ( theorem [ thm : commute ] ) if we have @xmath33 then @xmath34    this implies the following important corollaries : 1-parameter deformations along a hypersurface is a flow , that is , @xmath35 ; and deformations along disjoint hypersurfaces commute .",
    "for example , given a @xmath36 surface group , bending it along a curve and twisting it along another ( disjoint ) curve are commutative .",
    "the above construction and theorem are presented in section 2 .",
    "a large part of this paper is in section 3 where we switch attention to the case of surface groups in @xmath37 and study the limit of deformations along weighted simple closed curves that approach a measured lamination .",
    "let @xmath38 be a surface of genus @xmath8 .",
    "thurston introduced the space of measured laminations @xmath39 which can be thought of as a completion of the space of weighted simple closed @xmath40 which is in fact dense in @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the classical earthquake deformation is then defined to be the limit of fenchel - nielsen twists as a sequence in @xmath40 approach a measured lamination @xcite .",
    "we aim to generalize this method for anosov surface groups in @xmath3 in order to define earthquakes .",
    "guichard - wienhard @xcite showed that for @xmath3 surface groups , being anosov is equivalent to being convex cocompact ( see also the work of bowditch @xcite , kapovich - leeb - porti @xcite ) .",
    "we state below a reduced version of their theorem .",
    "[ thm : gw ] ( guichard - wienhard ) let @xmath41 be a finitely generated word hyperbolic group and @xmath1 a real semisimple lie group of real rank 1 . for a representation @xmath42 ,",
    "the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath7 is anosov .",
    "2 .   there exists a continuous @xmath7-equivariant and injective map @xmath43 3 .",
    "ker @xmath7 is finite and @xmath44 is convex cocompact .    indeed",
    "since @xmath38 is a closed surface , this coincide with the notion of @xmath45-quasifuchsian group in @xcite . when @xmath46 and @xmath47 , condition @xmath48 above implies that there exists a continuous @xmath7-equivariant injective map @xmath49 whose image is the limit set @xmath50 , a quasi - circle in @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , @xmath44 is purely loxodromic , each element of @xmath44 has an attracting and a repelling fixed point on @xmath50 , and the centralizer of this element must contain a 1-parameter group of hyperbolic transformations having the same pair of fixed points .",
    "we use these 1-parameter groups to define twist deformations of @xmath7 along weighted simple closed curves , where the weight determines the translation length .    to pass from simple closed curves to measured laminations",
    ", we use the geodesic currents view of measured laminations @xcite .",
    "thus a measured lamination is a @xmath52-invariant measure on @xmath53 with @xmath54 self - intersection",
    ". convergence of weighted simple closed curves to a measured lamination becomes convergence of measures on @xmath55 .",
    "together with the homeomorphism @xmath56 we can show the following convergence result .",
    "( corollary [ cor : convergence ] ) for any @xmath57 , @xmath58 an anosov surface group representation @xmath7 into @xmath3 , there is a neighborhood @xmath59 such that for any two weighted simple closed curves @xmath60 , the corresponding representations @xmath61 and @xmath62 are @xmath63 close .",
    "this means that we can simply define @xmath64 to be @xmath65 whenever @xmath66 , and we have a continuous map from @xmath39 to the space of representations near @xmath7 .",
    "this is a direct generalization of the classical earthquake on hyperbolic surfaces .",
    "but unlike in dimension 2 , simple dimension count implies that for @xmath67 , these earthquakes can not take @xmath7 to all nearby points in the moduli space .      in @xcite ,",
    "mcmullen defined a notion of complex earthquake : starting from a fuchsian group @xmath68 it combines classical earthquake and thurston s bending / grafting deformation and deform the original group to become quasifuchsian . theorem [ thm : commute ] and corollary [ cor : convergence ] implies that starting from a quasifuchsian @xmath69 , along any measured lamination , both earthquake and thurston s bending can be defined and they are commutative .",
    "thus we can combine them into quake - bend deformations with complex parameters like in @xcite .",
    "one can then ask whether it is possible to connect 2 quasifuchsian surface groups by 2 quake - bend operations .",
    "thurston showed that we can do that starting from a fuchsian group .",
    "( thurston , @xcite ) the projective grafting map @xmath70 is a homeomorphism .    where @xmath71 is the teichmuller space of hyperbolic structures whose holonomy are fuchsian , and @xmath72 is the space of @xmath73 structures whose holonomy include all quasifuchsian groups .    we have anosov surface groups in @xmath47 form an open subset @xmath74 of the moduli space @xmath75 of representations up to conjugations , but they are in general not a whole component of this space .",
    "an interesting question is whether earthquake paths @xmath76 can go outside of the closure of @xmath74 .",
    "another interesting direction is the question of fenchel - nielsen coordinates for @xmath3 surface groups , in particular @xmath77 .",
    "tan @xcite and kourouniotis @xcite constructed complex",
    "fenchel - nielsen coordinates for the case of @xmath78 .",
    "the situation in @xmath77 is more complicated since in some cases the bending parameter can be any @xmath79 rotation , and @xmath79 is not abelian .",
    "moreover , by dimension count there may be up to @xmath80 dimensions of internal parameter for each pair - of - pants in the decomposition , these parameters specify the arrangement of rotation axes . some work has been done in @xcite to study pair - of - pants groups in dimension 4 , but the whole picture remains mysterious .    *",
