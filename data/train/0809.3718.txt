    "the recent construction of a class of spinfoam models @xcite compatible with loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite has opened the possibility of consistently defining the lqg dynamics using spinfoam techniques @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the engle - pereira - rovelli - livine ( eprl ) spinfoam model for riemannian gravity introduced in @xcite . for given immirzi parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "the vertex amplitude is defined as follows : it is a function of five @xmath0 intertwiners @xmath4 and ten spins @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) given by @xmath8 the functions @xmath9 are normalized @xmath10-symbols , namely the contraction of five normalized 4-valent @xmath11 intertwiners according to the pattern of a 4-simplex , and the @xmath12 are fusion coefficients from @xmath0 to @xmath2 introduced in @xcite and defined below .",
    "such coefficients play a key role in the definition of the model .",
    "indeed the model differs from the one introduced by barrett and crane @xcite only for the structure of these coefficients . in this paper",
    "we study the large spin asymptotics of the eprl fusion coefficients .",
    "a careful analysis of the asymptotics of fusion coefficients is a step needed for the study of the semiclassical properties of the model .",
    "in fact , we have already used the results that we present in this paper in order to understand the features of the wavepacket evolution .",
    "the propagation of semiclassical wavepackets was introduced in @xcite as a new way to test the semiclassical limit of a spinfoam model .",
    "a spinfoam model has a good semiclassical behavior if semiclassical wavepackets ( peaked on a classical 3-geometry ) follow the trajectories predicted by the classical equations of motion . in @xcite",
    "this new technique was implemented in the epr flipped vertex model to study the propagation of intertwiner wavepackets . in @xcite",
    "we developed a more efficient numerical algorithm ( using techniques similar to @xcite ) and applied the asymptotic analysis presented here .",
    "this kind of study is , in the general context of spinfoam models , complementary to the semiclassical analysis based on the calculation of @xmath13-point functions .    in @xcite ,",
    "a strategy for recovering graviton correlations from a background - independent theory was introduced .",
    "the idea was tested on the barrett - crane model at the `` single - vertex '' level . at this level ,",
    "correlations of geometric operators can be checked against perturbative regge - calculus with a single @xmath14-simplex @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the barrett - crane model gives trivial dynamics to intertwiners , the analysis was restricted to the spin degrees of freedom  namely to area correlations only . on the other hand ,",
    "the new models are consistent with the lqg kinematics and allow the computations of semiclassical correlations of geometric observables as the area , the angle , the volume or the length @xcite . at the single - vertex level ,",
    "the semiclassical correlations for two local geometric operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 are simply given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vertex - amplitude introduced in ( [ eq : eprl ] ) and @xmath19 is a boundary semiclassical state peaked on a configuration @xmath20 of the intrinsic and the extrinsic geometry of the boundary of a region of space - time .",
    "the appropriate dependence on spins and intertwiners of the state @xmath19 is discussed in @xcite and uses the semiclassical tetrahedron state of @xcite . moreover , in order to guarantee that the appropriate correlations are present , in @xcite a specific form of the large spin asymptotics for the vertex amplitude was conjectured ( see @xcite ) . in order to show that the eprl vertex amplitude satisfies this conjecture , an analysis of the asymptotics of the fusion coefficients is needed .",
    "the region of parameter space of interest is large spins @xmath5 and intertwiners @xmath4 of the same order of magnitude of the spins . as a result",
    ", the fusion coefficients for the node @xmath21 , @xmath22 , can be seen as a function of the two bare variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 , of the fluctuation of the intertwiner @xmath25 and of the fluctuation of the four spins @xmath26 . in this paper",
    "we focus on this analysis . for different approaches to the semiclassical limit , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : analytic expr ] we show a simple analytic expression for the eprl fusion coefficients ; in section [ sec : asymptotics ] we use this expression for the analysis of the asymptotics of the coefficients in the region of parameter space of interest ; in section [ sec : semiclassical ] we show that the fusion coefficients map @xmath0 semiclassical intertwiners into @xmath2 semiclassical intertwiners .",

    "we have that the fusion coefficients vanish outside the domain @xmath39 moreover in the monochromatic case , @xmath40 , we have that the fusion coefficients are non - negative ( as follows from ( [ eq : f = qq ] ) ) and , for @xmath41 odd , they vanish ( because the first and the third column in the @xmath36-symbol are identical ) .    as discussed in @xcite , the fact that the spins labeling the links in ( [ eq : f = feyn ] ) have to be half - integers imposes a quantization condition on the immirzi parameter @xmath3 .",

    "the new analytic formula ( [ eq : f = qq]),([eq : q = analytic]),([eq : a = analytic ] ) is well suited for studying the behavior of the eprl fusion coefficients in different asymptotic regions of parameter space . in this paper",

    "this region is identified as follows : let us introduce a large spin @xmath51 and a large intertwiner ( i.e. virtual spin in a coupling channel ) @xmath52 ; let us also fix the ratio between @xmath52 and @xmath51 to be of order one  in particular we will take @xmath53 ; then we assume that    * the spins @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , are restricted to be of the form @xmath58 with the fluctuation @xmath59 small with respect to the background value @xmath51 .",

    "more precisely , the fluctuations are usually chosen to be at most of order @xmath147 .",
    "this is exactly the region we study in this paper . as to the region in the @xmath148 parameter space , the choice of the background values @xmath149 and",
    "the order of their fluctuations is made _ a  posteriori _ both by numerical investigation and by the form of the asymptotic expansion .",
    "it is evident that the previous considerations hold in particular for the function @xmath124 analyzed in this section .",
    "when @xmath46 we have that @xmath150 and we can read from the graph that the fusion coefficients vanish unless @xmath151 . furthermore it is easy to see that for @xmath46 the fusion coefficients vanish also when @xmath73 is different from @xmath62 .",
    "this can be seen , for instance , applying the identity @xmath85{60pt}{\\includegraphics{2lines.eps}}=\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{dim}\\,i}\\,\\delta_{i , i_r}\\parbox[c]{30pt}{\\includegraphics{2linescutted.eps } }      \\label{eq:}\\ ] ] to the graph with @xmath151 . as a result , we have simply @xmath152 and the asymptotic analysis is trivial . the previous equation can be also considered as a normalization check ; in fact , with the definition for the fusion coefficients , the eprl vertex amplitude reduces for @xmath46 to the usual @xmath0 bf vertex amplitude .",
    "we summarize our results and give some outlook in a few points .",
    "* we have shown a simple analytic formula for the lqg fusion coefficients , as defined in the eprl spinfoam model .",
    "* we have given a large spin asymptotic formula for the coefficients ; specifically , we made a perturbative asymptotic expansion around a background configuration dictated by the kind of boundary state considered .",
    "* the picture coming out from our analysis is promising : the fusion coefficients not only give nontrivial dynamics to intertwiners at the quantum level , but they seem to behave very well at semiclassical level , in fact they map semiclassical @xmath0 tetrahedra into semiclassical @xmath1 tetrahedra .",
    "this is to us a highly non - trivial property which , in turn , makes the semiclassical analysis of dynamics less obscure .",
    "a first application of the asymptotic formula can be found in @xcite . *",
    "our analysis is a step needed for the study of the full asymptotic expansion of the eprl vertex , which is part of our work in progress .",
