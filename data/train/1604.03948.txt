    "the two defining hallmarks of topological insulators are their distinctive bulk transport responses and the presence of current - carrying states confined at their boundaries  @xcite .",
    "the latter feature has rendered surface spectroscopy a well - established method for characterization of three - dimensional topological states of matter .",
    "on the other hand , spectral quantities in the bulk of a topological insulator are generally expected to be indistinguishable from those of a trivial insulator . however , topological semimetals feature a finite number of topologically nontrivial fermi surfaces in the bulk  @xcite . weyl semimetals ( wsms ) , in particular , possess pairs of nondegenerate linear band crossings at isolated points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) called weyl nodes",
    ". there , electronic properties are effectively governed by the relativistic weyl equation .",
    "functioning as sources and sinks of berry flux , these points give rise to a number of remarkable physical properties , including open constant - energy contours in the surface band structure called fermi arcs  @xcite and the condensed - matter realization of the chiral anomaly in the bulk  @xcite .    confirming theoretical predictions  @xcite , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has identified ta and nb monarsenides and monophosphides as the first realizations of wsms in solids  @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments  @xcite have unearthed representatives of a subsequently identified class of wsms labeled `` type - ii ''  @xcite .",
    "particular emphasis has been placed on resolving spectral signatures of topological origin at the boundary : arpes has been used to identify surface bands as fermi arcs  @xcite and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) has been employed to search for uniquely characterizing patterns  @xcite in surface quasiparticle interference ( qpi )  @xcite .",
    "magnetotransport measurements  @xcite , on the other hand , have revealed a negative magnetoresistance and quantum oscillations that are compatible with the presence of weyl nodes in the bulk .    despite the successful identification of wsm states in more than one material classes ,",
    "the topological content of individual weyl nodes is still inaccessible to experiment directly .",
    "quantum oscillations  @xcite , as well as recently proposed transport methods  @xcite , have the capacity to access the berry phase of fermi surfaces surrounding weyl nodes , whenever the chemical potential is favorably placed with respect to the nodal point .",
    "however , contributions from similarly sized fermi surfaces are superimposed in these methods and the overall response comes from the entire bz .",
    "moreover , these approaches yield no response at all when the chemical potential lies at the nodal point .",
    "experiments have so far inferred the topological charge from the number and dispersion of edge modes originating from the projections of weyl nodes at the boundary  @xcite .",
    "this approach is not always viable  @xcite and is impeded by overlaps of trivial boundary fermi surfaces , projections of bulk fermi surfaces and fermi arcs on a given surface .",
    "additionally , it may not be possible to cleave the surface of interest cleanly enough to observe the fermi arcs with arpes .",
    "the purpose of this work is to show that the topological nature of a wsm can be revealed by a targeted spectroscopic measurement of weyl nodes in the bulk using polarization - resolved resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs )  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : geom ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : taas ] we apply the measurement protocol to the weyl nodes in taas and show that it indeed yields the topological invariant of the targeted nodes in a material - specific application . finally , we discuss in detail the feasibility of the experimental procedure in sec .",

    "in wsms , the interesting physics happens close to the nodal points of the band structure .",
    "there , only two bands are relevant and the effective hamiltonian is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a spinor containing annihilation operators acting on electrons with wavevector @xmath2 and pseudospin @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 hamiltonian matrix is @xmath5 where the @xmath4 identity matrix @xmath6 and the three pauli matrices @xmath7 span the pseudospin basis , @xmath8 and @xmath9 an overall chemical potential .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are real - valued functions of the wave - number @xmath2 .",
    "the spectrum is @xmath14 with @xmath15 . in what follows",
    ", the pseudospin will arise from the _ orbital _ degree of freedom of electrons .",
    "the topological invariant pertinent to weyl nodes can be defined as  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes a closed two - dimensional surface that contains the weyl node and @xmath18 are coordinates that parametrize the surface .",
    "the integrand is the berry flux through @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "a weyl node carrying a topological charge @xmath19 , henceforth called a single weyl node , is described by @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are momentum - space velocities . for weyl nodes with @xmath23 , or double weyl nodes  @xcite , @xmath24 eq .",

    "the berry flux then winds twice along @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath29 is aligned to the berry flux , a measurement of the former yields the latter .",
    "we will now show how the components of @xmath29 can be identified in rixs .      in a rixs experiment , core electrons of a specific ion",
    "are promoted to an unoccupied state using an intense x - ray beam , thereby locally exciting the irradiated material into a highly energetic and very short - lived intermediate state  @xcite .",
    "the core and valence spin - orbital states that participate in the scattering can be selected by the choice of incoming and outgoing photon polarizations .",
    "subsequently , the core hole recombines with a valence electron , after a lifetime of the order of 1 femtosecond .",
    "the process imparts both energy and momentum to particle - hole excitations left behind in the material , as the momentum and energy of decaying electrons are generally not the same as those of the photoexcited one .",
    "their dispersion can be inferred by the differences in scattering angle and frequency of incoming and outgoing x - ray photons .",

    "here we consider the processes in which core electrons are promoted directly into the orbitals that generate the physics of interest .",
    "this experimental setting is frequently referred to as `` direct '' rixs . in the monarsenide / monophosphide family of wsms ,",
    "the bands at the weyl nodes are contributed predominantly by ta or nb ions .",
    "we therefore consider the @xmath41 or @xmath42 edges of nb or ta , which correspond to transitions @xmath43 .",
    "the intermediate state in rixs is typically very short - lived . due to this",
    ", the fast - collision approximation can be employed to accurately model the scattering process  @xcite . in the fast - collision approximation",

    "the entries of the complex matrix @xmath49 contain the fundamental absorption cross sections for spin - preserving and spin - flip processes , which also depend on the core orbitals  @xcite .",
    "note that core - hole dynamics is insignificant here , so the operators acting on core electrons have been dropped .",
    "an appropriate choice of polarizations can isolate the components of the ( pseudo)spin density . as a simple example , consider the measurement of spin winding in a wsm with tetragonal symmetry .",
    "to first order , the overall polarization dependence is given by the matrix  @xcite    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the @xmath4 identity matrix , @xmath7 is the vector of pauli matrices in ( pseudo)spin space , and @xmath52[eq : dec ]    with @xmath53 unit vectors .",
    "the fundamental x - ray scattering spectra @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the irradiated ions can be accurately determined via crystal - field calculations , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the above equations",
    ", it is seen that appropriate choice of cross - polarized x - rays can probe each of the spin components individually .",
    "for example , selecting @xmath56 and @xmath57 yields @xmath58 where we have defined the quantity @xmath59 all components of @xmath60 can be obtained in this manner .",
    "this selectivity is still possible even when all the terms up to third order in spin are included ( see eq .",
    "( 16 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and regardless of the precise value of the fundamental x - ray scattering spectra , as long as these are nonzero .    in wsms",
    ", the interesting physics happens close to the nodal points of the band structure .",
    "there , the effective electron spinor has a pseudospin @xmath61``@xmath62'',``@xmath63 '' , with `` @xmath62 '' and `` @xmath63 '' signifying two orthogonal linear combinations of the original spin and orbital degrees of freedom of the material .",
    "this combination is material - dependent and can be accurately calculated within dft . in this low - energy subspace ,",
    "the excitation and decay operators are reduced to this pseudospin subspace : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the matrix @xmath49 is similarly downfolded to the pseudospin basis and a decomposition similar to that of eq .",
    "[ eq : dec ] is obtained . in the special case where the orbital degree of freedom does not vary appreciably around the weyl node ,",
    "then the description of the winding is precisely that of eq .",
    "[ eq : dec ] , i.e. , @xmath66 . for the case of taas , studied below , the pseudospin is actually a `` pseudo - orbital '' degree of freedom , arising from the @xmath67 orbitals of ta .",
    "the respective rixs cross sections then reduce to    @xmath68    with @xmath69[eq : rixsxy ]    where @xmath22 and @xmath70 are the eigenstates of @xmath71 at momentum @xmath2 with band index @xmath72 . for scattering from a partially filled lower band , @xmath73 and    @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "fully analogous results are retrieved when @xmath77 .    in crystals with low symmetry",
    ", a single measurement with cross - polarized beams may not be sufficient to isolate the pseudospin components .",
    "it is , however , always possible to obtain rixs spectra for two or more different polarizations , which can then be appropriately added or subtracted to isolate the desired pseudospin density components themselves .",
    "for example , in the cuprates , where the relevant degree of freedom is simply the @xmath78 orbital , two differently polarized measurements are enough to extract useful information about the orbital structure with rixs  @xcite . the correct polarization combinations for the measurement of the topological charge can be deduced from a quantitative estimate of the participation of different orbitals at each @xmath2-point in the band structure , which is readily achievable with density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "since such detailed _ ab initio _ calculations of the orbital structure around weyl nodes of materials are lacking , in this proof - of - principle study we focus directly on the fundamental rixs scattering amplitude of eq .  .",
    "however , it should be stressed that accurate dft calculations can readily provide all the necessary information for an experimental case study .",

    "the zeros of @xmath90 reflect the winding of @xmath29 around the weyl node .",
    "the condition of eq .   has the solutions @xmath91 for a single weyl node .",
    "there are therefore 4 solutions for @xmath92 . for a double weyl node ,",
    "the solutions in the first quadrant are @xmath93 , and @xmath90 becomes zero for 8 values of @xmath94 in total .",
    "similarly , the rixs difference spectrum for a triple weyl node has 12 zero - crossings for @xmath94 .",
    "numerical calculation confirms that these are indeed the only solutions of eq .  .",
    "we therefore see that the number of zero - crossings of @xmath90 for scattering around a weyl node is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the topological charge .",
    "note that the zero - crossings are the same regardless of whether the scattering is intra- or inter - band , as the band index does not enter the cosine in eq .  .",
    "this means that the measurement is possible in both elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "this is important because , unlike quantum oscillations  @xcite , the rixs measurement works even in the case where the fermi surface that encloses a weyl node is vanishingly small .",
    "the rixs difference spectra @xmath90 for inter - band scattering , calculated for a few idealized cases , is shown fig .",
    "[ fig : rixswnodes ] .    in experiments on wsms ,",

    ", the contributions from weyl nodes will need to be disentangled in the resulting spectra , in order to extract the chern numbers .",
    "inter - node scattering between time - reversal or inversion symmetry partners , on the other hand , can come uniquely from a single pair of weyl nodes , avoiding spurious contributions .",
    "this facilitates the targeted measurement of the topological charge of specific weyl nodes in real materials . in the simple case of a linear spectrum around two weyl nodes related by time - reversal symmetry , intra- and inter - node scattering",

    "for a fixed energy transfer @xmath115 , scattering close to the node can take place between states on two concentric constant - energy surfaces @xmath17 and @xmath98 in reciprocal space , for which the energy condition @xmath116 is fulfilled [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : scat](b ) ] .",

    "the overall maximal scattering wavevectors occur in the equatorial scattering plane @xmath28 and we denote them by @xmath132 . for these wavevectors , the rixs difference spectrum reduces to @xmath133 since only scattering across the fermi surface can take place .",
    "we thus recover the zero - crossings of @xmath109 and therefore the topological charge of the weyl node .",
    "these zero - crossings of @xmath90 are exactly the ones that we found by explicit solution of eq .  .",
    "we note that our approach here bears some resemblance to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , although excitations in rixs are in the particle - hole channel instead .",
    "in fact , for simple enough fermi surfaces , the rixs spectrum contains the berry curvature seen by the particle - hole excitation in the outer shell of the three - dimensional scattering signal .",
    "this can then be integrated to yield the monopole charge , in full analogy to the paired - particle treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the advantage that no pairing is required .",
    "however , unlike the paired case , the rixs spectrum also contains all possible noncentrosymmetric contributions .",
    "the zero - crossings of @xmath90 are recovered in inelastic spectra as well . in this case ,",

    "this again leads to the sinusoidal modulation of the intensity on the outer rim of the measured signal , as outlined above .",
    "this analysis carries over to double and triple weyl nodes .",
    "in these cases , the shapes of the surfaces @xmath17 and @xmath98 are more complicated , but the antipodal scattering condition in constant-@xmath124 planes [ eq .",

    "we now discuss the effect of breaking the condition @xmath113 around the weyl node .",

    "a finite @xmath10 of this form does not affect the wavefunction ; it only deforms the cone , while maintaining the linearity of the bands .",
    "this causes a relative shift between @xmath17 and @xmath98 along one of the semi - principal axes .",
    "when this is the case , measurement of scattering in the plane perpendicular to the shift will still yield the topological invariant .",
    "suppose , for example , that @xmath140 .",
    "then , for rixs measurements at @xmath141 , the scattering takes place between concentric constant - energy ellipses as before and we recover the same zero - crossings as above .",

    "let us again consider only scattering for which @xmath80 and concern ourselves only with the trigonometric factor @xmath146 , which defines the zero - crossings .",

    "we have tested this robustness by adding random perturbations in the form of all possible terms of up to cubic order , each with a magnitude up to 0.2 times the linear velocity , to all components of @xmath29 and to @xmath10 for single weyl nodes and find that the signature of the topological charge remains unchanged ( see fig .",

    "note the unequal ranges in @xmath126 and @xmath127 , reflecting the peculiar shape of the fermi surface pocket shown in ( b ) . ]",
    "the equivalence of intra- and inter - node scattering exploited above is an artifact of the linearity of the hamiltonian .",
    "we now demonstrate the topological charge measurement in inter - node scattering in the presence of quadratic and cubic terms by an explicit calculation for the weyl nodes of taas in the @xmath28 plane .",
    "the picture supported by experiment is that of a pair of weyl nodes close to each of the four @xmath168 points of the bz , located a few mev below the fermi level  @xcite .",
    "the band structure close to one of these nodes can be accurately modeled using a @xmath171 @xmath164 model derived from the results of dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "the correct parameters for taas were obtained by comparison to experimental magnetotransport and arpes measurements  @xcite .",
    "this model yields an oblong boomerang - shaped fermi surface  @xcite , indicating the sizable quadratic terms present in the hamiltonian .",
    "the electron spin varies very little close to weyl nodes in both the dft and the @xmath164 model , so we can simply trace over the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the result is shown in fig .  [ fig : taasw1](c ) .",
    "again we recover the @xmath166 zero - crossings of @xmath165 around @xmath167 , with only a small region at the center of the spectrum obscured due to the irregular shape of constant - energy contours around the weyl node . the robustness against nonlinear terms , which can be understood on the more general grounds discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : geom ] , shows that topological features can be recovered by rixs even when band structures are quite complicated .",
    "our work shows how rixs can be deployed to the study of topologically nontrivial band structures .",
    "even though recent experimental efforts are directed towards using rixs to understand properties of strongly correlated materials  @xcite , the technique has been very successful in inferring the band structure of approximately noninteracting systems  @xcite .",
    "rixs offers options that are not available to other techniques : spin and orbital selective scattering that allows for momentum - resolved determination of pseudospin components in the bulk , insensitivity to surface imperfections and arbitrarily large electromagnetic fields , direct access to the unoccupied band structure that eliminates the need for a measurable fermi surface .",
    "this potential is especially tantalizing in settings where other spectroscopies are difficult to employ : the possibility for imaging of dirac or wsm band structures in arbitrarily strong electromagnetic fields means that rixs offers a unique platform for the direct spectroscopic observation of elusive physical phenomena , such as the chiral anomaly  @xcite .",
    "we estimate that already existing rixs instrumentation is sufficient to perform the measurement proposed in this work . for real materials ,",
    "the polarization dependence of the rixs cross section can be intricate .",
    "this means that one may need to perform two or more measurements with different polarization combinations in order to isolate the desired signals . even though cumbersome",
    ", this is certainly feasible : the polarization selectivity required has been successfully demonstrated experimentally at the @xmath172 edge of copper  @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution typically achieved in experiments is nominally in the desired range . for the case of taas ( nbas ) ,",
    "the states close to the fermi level are predominantly formed by the @xmath67 ( @xmath173 ) electrons of ta ( nb ) ( see , for example , the relevant calculation for taas in the supplemental material of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . considering that the weyl nodes in taas were resolved with @xmath174  mev  @xcite",
    ", a similar resolution would be enough for the experiment we propose .",
    "the @xmath41 edges of ta ( nb ) are below 12  kev ( 3  kev ) .",
    "existing beamlines can access this energy range using spectrometers with resolutions comparable to that of arpes .",
    "finally , both ta and nb @xmath42 and @xmath111 edges are in the soft x - ray regime ( @xmath175  ev ) and are therefore even more easily accessible , while the optical elements currently in use in detectors can offer resolutions of the order of 10 mev , which is comparable to the best resolution of current arpes spectra of taas  @xcite . when the separation between weyl points in reciprocal space is small , high momentum resolution is necessary .",
    "adequate resolution for the proposed measurement of the @xmath176 weyl nodes is achievable in rixs . as an example , we mention that energy and momentum resolutions of @xmath177  mev and @xmath178 have been reported for the @xmath172 edge of ir already some years ago  @xcite , whereas modern synchrotron facilities improve upon these figures by a large margin  @xcite . finally , recent magnetotransport and quantum oscillation measurements show that weyl nodes are present in tairte@xmath179  @xcite and detailed dft calculations predict that mn@xmath180sn and mn@xmath180ge are also wsms  @xcite .",
    "this means that existing spectrometers designed for ir and mn ions can be used to probe weyl nodes in these materials .    as an experimental technique , rixs has particular complications associated with it , which may depend on the specifics of the material under investigation .",
    "threshold singularities  @xcite constitute one such complication .",
    "for the measurement of weyl nodes proposed here , this issue can be avoided simply by detuning away from resonance  @xcite , since the measurement does not depend on satisfying the resonance condition exactly .",
    "the drawback of this detuning is that the photon count will drop , resulting in longer beamtimes .",
    "another complication that may be of concern in some materials is deexcitation via the `` fluorescence '' channel , i.e. , the case where an electron coming from a `` broad band '' fills the core hole .",
    "this may happen when a material is not so strongly correlated , or when it is a metal .",
    "this effect , however , is material specific and successful rixs measurements of elementary excitations have been performed even in cases where fluorescence intensity is high  @xcite .    in rixs ,",
    "the surface of materials is mostly transparent and consequently surface states can not be detected .",
    "on the other hand , complications related to surface preparation are bypassed .",
    "rixs requires only small sample volumes and can access the entire bz .",
    "it is insensitive to electromagnetic fields , a feature that may facilitate a direct spectroscopic detection of the chiral anomaly , even though the latter may also be accessible to high - resolution arpes measurements  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted that additional versatility may be afforded by careful examination of experimental rixs data .",
    "for example , an analysis of time scales , i.e. , inverse energy scales relevant to a material ( hoppings , spin - orbit coupling ) , may offer more in - depth information on the individual processes that make up the full rixs response  @xcite .    in the case where the pseudospin is indeed the real electron spin , the response defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] reduces to the measurement of the dynamic spin structure factor with magnetic rixs  @xcite , which will contain the zero - crossings indicating the winding of the spin around the weyl node .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) could also be used to obtain the same magnetic signature , as it measures the same quantity . however , in existing wsms , it is the orbital degree of freedom that winds around the weyl point and not the spin . furthermore , even in the case of a material with spin winding , ins would require large single crystals which may be difficult to grow .",
    "the methodology presented in this work can be straightforwardly extended to scattering between inequivalent nodes , where the outcome may vary . as an inelastic probe , rixs can also access features by scattering electrons across an energy gap .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that it can be used for the detection of bulk topological properties in gapped systems .",
    "the author thanks b.  a.  bernevig for insightful comments and encouragement throughout all stages of this work .",
    "he is also grateful to a.  g.  grushin , p.  kotetes , t.  neupert and j.  van den brink for critical reading and discussion of the manuscript , l.  j.  p.  ament , v.  bisogni , c.  mazzoli , n.  c.  plumb and m.  shi for invaluable input on rixs modeling and experiments , and j.  li and z.  wang for useful discussions of the band structures of wsms .",

    "to model the weyl nodes in taas , we use two models derived via independent dft calculations fitted to two different experimental measurements .",
    "the first is a linear @xmath164 theory presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was designed to fit the dft band structure close to the @xmath162 weyl nodes and match the experimentally observed fermi surface size and shape  @xcite .",

    "[ sec : taas ] we have chosen @xmath185  mev .    the pockets around the @xmath28 weyl nodes have a complicated shape that can not be captured by linear terms alone . by including quadratic and cubic terms ,",

    "@xcite can be used to accurately model the band structure around the @xmath28 weyl nodes .",
    "this model has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to reproduce the ring - shaped trivial fermi surface and the correct location and number of weyl nodes obtained in dft results , which were used to interpret arpes and magnetotransport measurements . the hamiltonian matrix obtained after",
    "the fitting is    @xmath186    where @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) , @xmath189 are the identity and pauli matrices spanning the spin ( effective orbital ) degree of freedom , and @xmath190[eq : w1 ]    with @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , all in units of mev and the appropriate power of @xmath207 .",
    "this model does not account for the correct position of the chemical potential , so we shift the energy spectrum by an additional @xmath208  mev , in order to reproduce the size and shape of the fermi surface predicted by dft . note that the prefactors @xmath209 of quadratic and cubic terms are large compared to those of linear terms , meaning that this model is away from the idealized linear limit .",
    "-@xmath127 intensity map and ( b ) spectrum as a function of the polar coordinate @xmath142 of the rixs difference @xmath90 , integrated over the range from 0 to 80  mev , for the trivial node in cd@xmath180as@xmath210 with an applied magnetic field , as described by the low energy theory of eq .",

    "such nodes appear when there are higher - order crossing points in a band structure .",
    "for example , such a node can be found in the band structure of cd@xmath180as@xmath210 in a magnetic field along [ 100 ]  @xcite . the relevant low - energy theory for this node",
    "can be written simply as  @xcite          the rixs difference spectrum for intra - node scattering is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonweyl ] .",
    "there are no zero - crossings of @xmath90 , exactly as expected from the @xmath95 rule derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : meas ] .",
    "the same holds in any other @xmath97-plane for this node .",
    "this example thus illustrates that topological and trivial nodes can be distinguished from their different responses to polarized resonant x - rays .",
    "it is also interesting to briefly consider the rixs response of a dirac semimetal . in these materials , nodes are spin - degenerate due to time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the minimal low - energy description around a node requires a @xmath171 dirac spinor , which , in the simplest case , is just two antichiral copies of the weyl equation .",
    "although more complicated , a rixs measurement similar to the one presented here may still be possible , exploiting the combined spin - orbital selectivity of the method . despite the similarities between the two classes of materials , dirac and weyl semimetals are distinct and",
    "can even be distinguished by their rixs responses in a magnetic field .",
    "breaking time reversal in a dirac semimetal leads to splitting of dirac nodes . since time - reversal symmetry breaking in the laboratory entails sizable magnetic fields ,",
    "angle - resolved photoemission experiments can not be used to capture this splitting . in these cases , rixs is a viable method to infer the band structure around the split dirac nodes , even without the need for polarization resolution , along the lines of refs .",
    "we defer a detailed discussion of this application of rixs to a dedicated study .",
