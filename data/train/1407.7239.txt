    "the reaction diffusion system studied in this paper is described using an established analytical approach,@xcite .",
    "the nonuniform motion of the solution front is also investigated .",
    "the solution of front is given by a relationship between the normal velocity of the front vector and its curvature @xmath0 consisting of an integrodifferential equation for the front curve.@xcite the model is a simple , two - component model that gives rise to a fast propagator ( activator ) and recovery variable known as an inhibitor.@xcite this is due to presence of nonequilibrium ising - bloch bifurcation . adding the kinetic coefficients requires detailed reaction schemes of incoming waves from the energetic material into the lens .",
    "the basic mechanisms are : phase change to solid intermediates and the formation of gaseous products . because the material decomposes below its melting point , this results in a complex pathway involving no , nitroso , and non - violent resistance ( nvr ) cycles .",
    "one pathway involves elimination of hono and hon , leading to the formation of hcn ( ost ; c@xmath1h 3n@xmath1o ) under high confinement conditions .",
    "the other cycle includes the formation of h@xmath2o , no and no@xmath2 .",
    "the next reaction leads to no cycles , no@xmath2 with nitroso cycles and the formation of minor products at higher pressures,@xcite interfacing the material with nitroguanidine leads to diffusion of decomposition products and the creation of spiral waves in the chemical .",
    "figure [ arbode ] demonstrates the behaviour of nitroguanidine on a model developed for this purpose based on a nonlinear system .     and c@xmath3n molecules .",
    "at @xmath4 to @xmath5 , there is an increase temperature due to incoming waves ; at @xmath5 to @xmath6 , there is a phase change from solid to vapor , where at @xmath6 outburst occurs ( @xmath6 is defined outside of the dirichlet boundaries.),width=340 ]    the stars show the diffusion of @xmath7 molecules into nitroguanidine , which causes a temperature increase creating an unstable condition within the system .",
    "this leads to an increase in kinetic energy and molar volume , and ultimately to the explosion of the chemical .",
    "this work will lead to important new research in the fields of guided stress / shock waves .",
    "the model developed can be applied to any diffusive products in organic reactant . in this paper ,",
    "the diffusive products are dealt with as external control parameters which affect the wave behaviour in the lens .",
    "specifically , these parameters are the crystal temperature and partial pressures of the decomposition products .",
    "hence , an understanding of the decomposition is essential . in studying the decomposition of such a system",
    ", it is always assumed that it enters the vapor phase before dissociating . in a series of experiments , it was found to release about 500 kj.mol@xmath8 of energy , independent of the heating rate and mass . the majority of the decomposition products form via the scission of @xmath7 , n - no@xmath2 and c@xmath3n bonds .",
    "the decomposition is largely independent of the heating rate , which is due to the total heat release ( due to the exothermic decomposition reactions ) .",
    "finding bifurcation requires knowledge of the partial pressures of the reactants and products , as well as their kinetic rates.@xcite . according to several",
    "study the kinetic behaviour of molecular dissociation for @xmath7 bond dissociation is 200 kj / mol and the energy of decomposition of the triple bond - fission reaction products of ch@xmath2nno@xmath2 are 155 , 234 and 297 kj.mol@xmath8 .",
    "for the lens , the reaction - diffusion system is introduced through the bond - fission products of @xmath7 and c@xmath3n at dirichlet boundaries . because this is a bistable system , a front - like structure connects the two fronts in a homogeneous steady state . a small perturbation known as an ising  bloch bifurcation@xcite exists , where the fronts exchange stability with a pair of counter - propagating bloch fronts .",
    "this front motion is broken by imposing a fixed chemical concentration at the boundary of the reactor . here",
    ", the nitroguanidine molecule is considered as a stationary spot to bifurcate the incoming fronts . the spiral waves and breaking spots in an excitable@xcite and bistable medium are examples of oscillatory behaviour ; the oscillations often result from the underlying oscillating dynamics of local chemical kinetics.@xcite            the model presented in this paper was used to study the wave propagation under three dynamic boundary conditions .",
    "this propagation can influence the state of reactants by displacing them .",
    "this is due to the increase in specific volume , which generates compression waves and sets the reactants and flame front into motion following precursor shock .",
    "thus , the three important , overriding factors are the wave speed , specific volume ratio and boundary conditions . the boundary condition in this model is therefore set at a critical speed of @xmath9 at which the initial wave speed is lower than that of the shockwave - induced compression ( @xmath10 ) , such that an acceleration mechanism can be introduced through an external field .",
    "here , @xmath11 is the burn velocity , and @xmath12 is sound speed in front of the shock . under this condition ,",
    "the chemical reaction is affected by the compression shock wave and shock diffusion replaces diffusion - controlled flame propagation.@xcite having established the following parameters : crystal pressure ( t@xmath13 ) , partial pressures for @xmath7 and c@xmath3n resulting from bond dissociation as p@xmath14 and p@xmath15 , kinetic rates ( @xmath0 ) , surface area of the reaction diffusion system ( s@xmath16 ) and the external field ( @xmath17 ) , the reaction diffusion system is given by : @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the two variables for the propagator and inhibitor.@xcite the parameter @xmath22 represents the kinetic expression for @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is given by the rate of molecules hitting the surface for p@xmath14 and p@xmath15 ( note that @xmath20 is given in units of saturation coverage ) , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the partial pressures induced by bond dissociation and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the lattice cross - sections . @xmath31 and",

    "the system has two solutions for the up and down states .",
    "the localized functions @xmath22 and @xmath24 are defined through the decomposition properties of the material . however , by arbitrary definition , if @xmath33 , the stationary front solution loses its stability to pitchfork bifurcation for @xmath34.@xcite arbitrary analysis of eq .",

    "the diffusion parameter @xmath36 affects the total system behaviour , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 , and leads to subdiffusive behaviour at the boundary and superdiffusive behaviour far from the edges . a simplified phase diagram for the relative diffusion parameter is given by figure [ difphase1].the effect of external field",
    "can be defined for three regions : @xmath51 at the front corresponding to the down state invading the up state , @xmath52 at the front corresponding to the up state invading the down state and @xmath53 where both fronts exist . for a quantitative study of the front dynamics and relative pattern characteristics for the inner region ,",
    "the front is defined at @xmath54 , stretching the spatial coordinates according to @xmath55 and expanding @xmath20 and @xmath21 according to @xmath56 steps . here",
    ", @xmath57 corresponds to the ratio across the fronts .",
    "the initial value of @xmath21 was measured at the material interface with the nitroguanidine lens and @xmath20 was measured using @xmath58 . with a step size of @xmath56 we have : @xmath59 the solution to eq . [ bif4 ]",
    "yields the nonequilibrium ising - bloch bifurcation ( nib ) velocity , which is calculated for the energetic diffusive molecules using : @xmath60 the total normal front velocity can be found using : @xmath61 where @xmath0 is the curvature induced by compression waves during outburst . by calculating the front velocity ( @xmath62 ) , the effect of an external field at the front residue can also be analysed .",
    "as previously mentioned , the compression wave is treated as an external field which accelerates the flame velocity and diffusion in the lens and forms a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "the compression wave front in a heterogeneous solid is more complex than in a homogeneous solid because of the presence of voids , grains and flaws.@xcite a good approximation of the compression wave shape function in a homogeneous system can be given using a similar front to those developed for diffusion systems .",
    "figure [ difphase1]b demonstrates the homogeneous compression fronts introduced to the system .",
    "the compression waves interact with the lower and upper boundaries at @xmath63 , which is the termination point .",
    "a dynamic equation for @xmath64 requires the branches to be scaled spatially . by assuming un - stretched",
    "coordinates : @xmath65 here , @xmath66 represents the compression wave front . by substituting eq .",
    "[ bif6 ] into eq .",
    "[ bif7 ] : @xmath67 initially @xmath62 is approximated at @xmath68 .",
    "the front solution to eq .",
    "[ bif8]a is given for different diffusivity phases .",
    "regions @xmath69 and @xmath70 show opposing behaviour of decreasing and increasing kinetics of the bloch fronts through a metastable region @xmath71 . introducing the compression waves leads the system to instability ( region @xmath70 ) causing faster energy release .",
    "finally , oscillation in the model is produced so that the validity of the system for an unstable nonlinear condition can be approximated using fig .",
    "[ difphase]b .",
    "the production of wave fronts in the nitroguanidine lens shows inhibitor production giving rise to two additional fronts at the chemical fixed point ( nitroguanidine ) .",
    "this provides a predictive method for the future design of such a system where guided wave propagation in the medium is necessary .",
    "it was also shown that the front - like structure connects the two fronts in a homogeneous steady state along the fixed chemical point such that bifurcation occurs in the medium .",
    "however , the kinetics of phase transition in nitroguanidine are too complex to be described by a steady state form of equation because turbulent waves are formed upon the diffusion of decomposition at microseconds of diffusion , and fronts lose their stability to lattice deformation . however , an unstable solution could be obtained by introducing a sticking variable to eq .",
    "[ bif2 ] to provide phase transformation instability to the solution , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ difphase]a .",
    "phase transformation therefore changes the faceting by influencing the adsorption rate , lattice heat increase , and extended induced partial bond dissociation .",
    "this also causes further external periodic perturbations in a metastable condition . introducing the nonlinear form of diffusion",
    "increased the efficiency of such an approach if compared with the standard model .",
    "the diffusion of the decomposition products in a nitroguanidine lens was studied in a chaotic system .",
    "the diffusion of the composites in a wave shaper was described by a two - variable model with inhibition and production in the reaction diffusion system .",
    "the calculation of wave propagation showed a good predictive behaviour for microseconds after the disruption in nitroguanidine .",
