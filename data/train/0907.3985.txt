    "although the existence of dark matter in the universe is promising , its observational evidences rely only on its gravitational properties . despite tremendous efforts , particle physics natures of the dark matter",
    "remains unrevealed .",
    "many possible ways to detect the dark matter were proposed so far  @xcite .",
    "direct detection experiments search for the dark matter scattering signatures off nucleons .",
    "indirect detection experiments search for characteristic cosmic - ray signals originated from dark matter annihilation inside and/or outside the galaxy .",
    "recently the pamela satellite reported an excess of cosmic - ray positron flux around the energy @xmath3 - 100  gev  @xcite , and it can be interpreted as a signal of dark matter annihilation .",
    "results of the fermi satellite  @xcite on the cosmic - ray electron plus positron flux seems to be consistent with the dark matter interpretation of the pamela excess . if this scenario is correct , however , a fairly large annihilation cross section , typically @xmath4-@xmath5 is required , which is two- or three - orders of magnitude larger than the canonical value ( @xmath6 ) reproducing the correct dark matter abundance under the standard thermal freeze out scenario .",
    "it was pointed out that the existence of dark matter with such a large annihilation cross section is constrained from many observations : gamma - rays from galactic center  @xcite or from extragalactic background  @xcite , neutrinos  @xcite , anti - protons  @xcite , synchrotron radiation , and even from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite .",
    "more or less , all of these constraints so far seem to be comparable to one another .",
    "some models can be killed by some observations , but there is a possible way out .",
    "for example , the galactic gamma - ray constraint is often very stringent but sensitive to the density profile of the dark matter halo .",
    "it can be evaded by assuming the flat cored profile .    in this paper",
    "we propose a more rigorous way to constrain dark matter annihilation cross section .",
    "although dark matter annihilates with each other throughout whole history of the universe , let us now focus on its effects around the recombination epoch .",
    "dark matter annihilation injects high energy particles into thermal plasma consisting of photons , electrons , protons , neutral hydrogens and heliums .",
    "high energy particles interact with background plasma and some fraction of their energy is used for the ionization of neutral hydrogens .",
    "therefore , dark matter annihilation affects the recombination history of the hydrogen resulting in higher residual ionization fraction ( @xmath7 ) than the standard value .",
    "even a slight shift of @xmath7 can cause a drastic effect on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , and hence the annihilation rate is constrained from the precise measurements of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "similar analyses were carried out in several papers  @xcite , especially in connection with recent anomalous cosmic - ray positron / electron fluxes @xcite .",
    "many of those analyses are based on the study in ref .",

    "suppose that an electron in the energy bin @xmath11 is injected at the redshift @xmath12 .",
    "this electron interacts with background particles and redistribute its energy toward lower bins in the form of both electrons and photons .",
