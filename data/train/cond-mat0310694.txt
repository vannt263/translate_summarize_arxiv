    "magnetic nanoparticles , or nanoscale magnetic systems , have generated continuous interest since late 1940s as the investigation of their properties turned out to be challenging from both scientific and technological point of view . in 1949 , in a pioneering work @xcite , nel set the pace towards understanding of the magnetic behavior of nanoparticles , leading to an important development of fundamental theories of magnetism and modeling of magnetic materials , as well as remarkable technological advances , e.g. , in the area of information storage and data processing , fostering the development of magnetorecording media with increasingly higher densities .",
    "nanoparticles , as compared to bulk materials , possess very important novel properties such as enhanced remanence and giant coercivity , as well as exponentially slow relaxation at low temperature due to anisotropy barriers , which ensures great stability of the information stored .",
    "however , nanoparticles become _ superparamagnetic _ @xcite at finite temperatures for very small sizes , and this is an impairment to the information storage . on the other hand , discovery of superparamagnetism that results from thermally",
    "activated crossing of the anisotropy energy barrier by the magnetic moment of the particle opened a rich area to the application of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "there are mainly two types of nanoparticle samples : i ) assemblies of , e.g. , cobalt , nickel or maghemite , nanoparticles with volume distribution and randomly oriented axes of magnetocrystalline anisotropy ; ii ) isolated single particles of cobalt or nickel that can be probed by the micro - squid technique @xcite .",
    "while most of the experiments have been done on assemblies , isolated particles are more important both as units of information storage and as a physical system",
    ".    in the investigation of the static properties of magnetic nanoparticles a great deal of work up to date has been based on the monte carlo ( mc ) technique .",
    "in addition to numerous simulations of the ising model , this technique has been used with the more adequate classical heisenberg model to simulate idealized isotropic models with simple cubic ( sc ) lattice and spherical shape in ref .",
    "magnetic nanoparticles with realistic lattice structure were recently simulated in ref .",
    "@xcite taking into account the surface anisotropy ( sa ) and ddi .",
    "on the other hand , in most of theoretical approaches to the dynamics of a small magnetic particle the latter is considered as a single magnetic moment .",
    "this is the _ one - spin approximation _ that is only valid for particles that are not too large and thus are single - domain , and not too small to be free from surface effects . letting apart spin tunneling ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that becomes important for extremely small sizes such as those of molecular magnets , the magnetic moment can overcome the anisotropy - energy barrier and thus reverse its direction , at least in two ways : either under applied magnetic field that suppresses the barrier , or via thermal fluctuations .",
    "the former , at zero temperature , is well described for particles with the uniaxial anisotropy by the stoner - wohlfarth model @xcite .",
    "thermally activated crossing of the energy barrier is described by the nel - brown model @xcite and its extensions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . at elevated temperatures , rotation of the magnetization in materials with strong anisotropy",
    "is always accompanied by changing its magnitude .",
    "this results in a shrinking of the stoner - wohlfarth astroid as described by the modified landau theory @xcite , and ( qualitatively ) confirmed by experiments @xcite .",
    "both stoner - wohlfarth and nel - brown models have been confirmed by experiments on individual cobalt particles @xcite .",
    "however for magnetic particles with strong surface anisotropy magnetization switching occurs as the result of successive switching of individual ( or clusters of ) spins inside the particle @xcite .",
    "such deviations from the one - spin approximation have been observed in metallic particles @xcite , @xcite , and ferrite particles @xcite , @xcite . deviations from the one - spin approximation and temperature effects",
    "lead to the absence of magnetization saturation at high fields @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , shifted hysteresis loops after cooling in field , and field dependence of the magnetization at very low temperatures .",
    "the latter effect has been clearly identified in dilute assemblies of maghemite particles @xcite of @xmath0 nm in diameter .",
    "in addition , aging effects have been observed in single particles of cobalt and have been attributed to the oxidation of the sample surface into antiferromagnetic coo ( see @xcite and references therein . ) .",
    "it was argued that the magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic particle with antiferromagnetic shell is governed by two mechanisms that are supposed to result from the spin frustration at the core - shell interface of the particle .",
    "some of the above - mentioned novel features are most likely due to magnetic disorder at the surface which induces a canting of spins inside the particle , or in other words , an inhomogeneous magnetic state .",
    "this effect was first observed with the help of mssbauer spectroscopy by coey @xcite and later by morrish and haneda ( see @xcite for a review ) , and later by pren et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also the recent article @xcite ) . to sum up , the picture of a single - domain magnetic particle with all spins pointing into the same direction is no longer valid when one considers the effect of misaligned spins on the surface , which makes up to @xmath1 of the total volume in a particle of @xmath0 nm in diameter .",
    "one of our goals is thus is to understand the effect of surfaces on the thermodynamics and magnetization profiles in small systems , and subsequently upon their dynamics .",
    "this requires a microscopic approach to account for the local environment inside the particle , microscopic interactions such as spin - spin exchange , ddi , and the magneto - crystalline bulk and surface anisotropy .",
    "as this task is difficult owing to the large number of degrees of freedom involved , one has to gain a sufficient understanding of static properties before proceeding to the dynamics .",
    "there are three main effects that distinguish magnetic particles from bulk magnets and that were investigated in a series of our recent publications :    1 .",
    "finite - size effect in isotropic magnetic particles with idealized periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the spin - wave spectrum of such particles is discrete and there is the mode with @xmath2 that corresponds to the global rotation of the particle . as a result",
    ", the standard spin - wave theory fails and one has to distinguish between @xmath3 and _ intrinsic _ magnetizations .",
    "boundary effect , i.e. , pure effect of the free boundary conditions at the surface in the absence of the surface anisotropy .",
    "this effect leads to the decrease of the particle s intrinsic magnetization and it makes the latter inhomogeneous at @xmath4 .",
    "3 .   effect of surface anisotropy that changes the ground state of the particle and makes the intrinsic magnetization inhomogeneous even at @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] we describe the hamiltonian and introduce the basic notions of the induced and the intrinsic magnetizations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mspwtse ] , we first study inhomogeneities in small magnetic particles of a box shape induced by pure boundary effects in the absence of surface anisotropy , i.e. , the effect of free boundary conditions ( fbc ) , and compare their influence with that of the finite - size effects in an idealized model with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "we consider spins as @xmath6-component classical vectors . at",
    "first we present analytical and numerical results in the whole range of temperatures in the limit @xmath7 where the problem simplifies .",
    "then for the classical heisenberg model , @xmath8 at low temperatures we formulate the modified spin - wave theory accounting for the global rotation of the particle s magnetization .",
    "the results are compared with those of our mc simulations . in sec .  [",
    "sec : mspwse ] we consider round - shaped systems and include surface anisotropy . in the case of the sa much weaker than the exchange interaction we study the problem perturbatively in small deviations from the perfectly ordered , collinear state .",
    "then we investigate the hysteretic properties and the behavior of the magnetization as a function of temperature and applied field by mc simulations .",
    "the last section summarizes the results and points out open problems .",
    "within the classical approximation it is convenient to represent the atomic spin as the three - component spin vector @xmath9 of unit length on the lattice site @xmath10 .",
    "we will consider the hamiltonian that in general includes the exchange interaction , magneto - crystalline anisotropic energy , zeeman energy , and the energy of dipolar interactions ( ddi ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the value of the atomic spin .",

    "( [ hamgeneral ] ) reads @xmath15 with easy axis @xmath16 and constant @xmath17 .",
    "this anisotropy model can be used to describe the surface effect if one attributes the same easy axis and the same anisotropy constant @xmath18 for all core spins and different easy axes and anisotropy constants to surface spins . within the simplest transverse surface anisotropy ( tsa )",

    "if one discards @xmath29 and @xmath30 the hamiltonian ( [ hamgeneral ] ) can be generalized for @xmath6-component spin vectors .",
    "this is useful as in the limit @xmath31 the problem simplifies while retaining important physics , see below .",
    "magnetic particles of _ finite size _ do not show magnetic ordering at nonzero temperatures at @xmath32 as the global magnetization of the particle can assume all possible directions ( superparamagnetism ) .",
    "it is thus convenient to define two magnetizations , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the first being the magnetization induced by the magnetic field and the second being a measure of the short - range order in the particle . omitting the factor @xmath35 that can be restored later , we first define the magnetization of a microscopic spin configuration @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of magnetic atoms in the system .",
    "the thermodynamic average of @xmath38 yields what we call the _ induced magnetization _ @xmath39 the _ intrinsic magnetization _ is related to the spin correlation function : @xmath40    if the temperature is low and there is no surface anisotropy , all spins in the particle are bound together by the exchange interaction and @xmath38 behaves as a rigid `` giant spin '' , @xmath41 . if a magnetic field @xmath42 is applied , @xmath38 exhibits an average in the direction of @xmath43 which leads to a nonzero value of the induced magnetization @xmath44 for isotropic @xmath6-component vector models ( including the ising model , @xmath45 @xcite the latter is given by the well known formula    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the langevin function [ @xmath48 for the isotropic heisenberg model and @xmath49 for the ising model ] .",
    "an important question is whether eq .",
    "( [ spmrelation ] ) remains valid at elevated temperatures where @xmath50 .",

( [ spmrelation ] ) , becomes exact for @xmath51 but otherwise it contradicts the exact relation @xmath52    one also can introduce the local intrinsic magnetization @xmath53 according to @xmath54 this quantity is smaller near the boundaries of the particle than in the core for the model with fbc because of boundary effects at @xmath55",
    "finite - size magnetic systems with free boundary conditions ( fbc ) present a spatially inhomogeneous many - body problem . in this section",
    "we shall only deal with finite - size versus boundary effects , leaving the more profound effects of the surface anisotropy for the next section .",
    "one of the interesting problems here is the interplay between boundary effects due to fbc and the `` pure '' finite - size effects . in systems of hypercubic shape",
    ", the latter can be singled out by using artificial periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "the standard mean - field approximation ( mfa ) and spin - wave theory ( swt ) are inappropriate for finite systems because of the goldstone mode associated with the global rotation of the magnetic moment in zero field .",
    "appropriate improvements include the so - called @xmath7 model ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : asm ] ) operating at all temperatures and the modified spin - wave theory for finite magnets at low temperatures ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : swtmc ] ) . also the mc routine should incorporate global rotations of spins , in addition to the metropolis algorithm of individual spin rotations .",
    "one can improve upon the mfa by taking into account correlations in a wide temperature range for bulk and finite magnets by replacing 3-component spin vectors in ( [ hamgeneral ] ) by @xmath6-component ones and taking the limit @xmath51 .",

    "<S> we show that the competition between the exchange and surface anisotropy leads to spin canting dependent on the orientation of the average magnetization with respect to the crystallographic axes and thus to a second - order effective anisotropy of the particle . we have also investigated the switching mechanism of the magnetization upon varying the surface anisotropy constant . </S>",
