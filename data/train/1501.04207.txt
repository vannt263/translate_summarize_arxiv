    "understanding the magnetic field configuration in dynamic solar events such as flares is an unsolved problem of solar physics .",
    "flares are hard - to - predict events and are the result of a global change in the magnetic field topology .",
    "these changes mainly happen in the chromosphere and corona . therefore , full - stokes polarimetric observations of flares , especially including the chromosphere , are essential .",
    "they are , however , challenging .",
    "many previous studies have focused on the photospheric magnetic field underneath flare events .",
    "for instance , variations of the longitudinal magnetic field of the order of @xmath5  g were observed by @xcite , and up to almost @xmath6  g by @xcite below x - class flares .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath7  g in the magnetic field strength was also detected by @xcite during the onset of a microflare .",
    "it seems clear that changes happen in the photospheric magnetic field during flares .",
    "however , it is controversial whether these variations are either associated with an increase or a decrease of the magnetic field strength .",
    "@xcite studied the photospheric magnetic field in 77 m- or x - class flares .",
    "both , an increase and decrease of the magnetic field was detected in different flares .",
    "these authors found absolute changes of up to @xmath8  g in the longitudinal magnetic field and linked an increase of magnetic field strength to the presence of larger horizontal fields , as observed in their work concerning flares near the limb . in agreement with this , @xcite also predicted changes leading to more horizontal fields .",
    "recently , @xcite obtained first evidence of a rapidly increasing horizontal magnetic field of @xmath9  g along the polarity inversion line ( pil ) in only 30 minutes ( starting at the beginning of the flare ) .",
    "the authors conjecture that reconnection processes after the flare could trigger the formation of low - lying horizontal fields .    here , we report on a set of full - stokes spectropolarimetric observations in the near infrared in a spectral interval covering the photospheric sii 10827   line and the chromospheric he i 10830    triplet . using a scanning spectrograph ,",
    "several maps of an active region were obtained before , during and after the development of an m3.2 flare , making it possible to derive the magnetic and dynamical disturbances at photospheric layers .",
    "interestingly , some studies on flares have recently been published using data obtained in the same spectral region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with a data set with similar characteristics , @xcite concentrated their study on the seismic implications of the flare .",
    "these authors derived an increase of the photospheric magnetic field when comparing the maps before and after the flare .",
    "unfortunately , they did not analyze the photospheric stokes spectra of their map taken during the flare .",
    "@xcite performed one scan of an active region after the onset of a flare and measured the stokes profiles of the sii 10827   line and of the hei 10830   triplet , deriving the magnetic structure of a filament present in the active region .",
    "other works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) only used either he i 10830    chromospheric filtergrams or intensity spectra . in this paper , we complement previous studies by analyzing the photospheric magnetic and dynamic changes in the emission region before , during and after the flare .",
    "observations of the active region ( ar ) noaa 11748 were carried out at the vacuum tower telescope ( vtt , tenerife , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on 2013 may 17 .",
    "the setup included the tenerife infrared polarimeter ( tip - ii ; * ? ? ? * ) for full stokes spectropolarimetry in the he i 10830    spectral region .",
    "noaa 11748 sharply increased its activity towards 2013 may 13 , when 14 flares , classes between c and x , occurred .",
    "the number of flares and their activity gradually decreased in the next days .",
    "however , a strong m3.2 class flare was observed on 2013 may 17 while we were scanning with the slit along the pil at coordinates ( n  11@xmath10 , e  36@xmath10 ) .",
    "the flare started at 8:43  ut , peaked at around 8:57  ut , and ended at 9:19  ut .",
    "the first spatial scan was carried out between 7:48 ",
    "8:36  ut ( pre - flare phase ) , the second one between 8:36  9:06  ut ( flare phase ) , and the third one between 9:06  9:37  ut ( post - flare phase ) , thus covering the whole flare activation and relaxation process .",
    "an additional scan of the same area was performed immediately after the third scan , between 9:38 ",
    "10:08  ut .    the exposure time per slit position was 10  s and the scanning step 035 .",
    "the pixel size along the slit was 017 .",
    "the kiepenheuer - institute adaptive optics system ( kaos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was locked on photospheric high - contrast structures , like pores and small penumbrae , and was crucial to improve the fair - quality seeing conditions . the observed spectral range with tip - ii spanned from 10824 to 10835   , with a spectral sampling of @xmath11  mpx@xmath4 .",
    "this spectral region comprises the photospheric sii 10827    line , the chromospheric hei 10830    triplet , and two telluric lines .",
    "dark current , flat - field corrections and the standard polarimetric calibration for the tip - ii instrument were carried out @xcite .",
    "the continuum was corrected for varying intensity due to changing air mass and center - to - limb variations at different positions on the solar disk while performing the scans .",
    "this was performed by second - order least - square polynomial fits and averages over quiet - sun areas on the maps .",
    "all pixels along the slit within one scan step were then normalized to their corresponding continuum value .",
    "wavelength calibration is based on the two nearby telluric lines following the procedure described in appendices a and b of @xcite , which compares the wavelength separation between telluric lines in a quiet - sun area with the fourier transform spectrometer spectrum ( fts ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to obtain the spectral sampling .",
    "finally , wavelengths were corrected for earth s orbital motions , solar rotation , and the solar gravity redshift @xcite , thus the line - of - sight ( los ) velocities refer to an absolute scale .",
    "the photospheric sii line was inverted using the stokes inversions based on response functions code ( sir ; * ? ? ?",
    "sir solves the radiative transfer equation under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) and hydrostatic equilibrium . in this letter , we focus on the inferred magnetic field strength and the los velocity patterns .",
    "the original spatial resolution was preserved , with a pixel size of @xmath12  arcsec@xmath13 .",
    "the inversions were carried out using the harvard - smithsonian reference atmosphere model ( hsra ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as an initial guess for the atmosphere .",
    "the model atmosphere covers a range given as the logarithm of the los continuum optical depth @xmath14 at 5000    of @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite made an extensive analysis of inversion tests using different initial model atmospheres .",
    "the output atmospheres were not much dependent on the starting atmosphere , but an initial magnetic field strength of 500 g seemed to be an optimum choice , since it returned the best fits while minimizing the number of iterations required for the convergence .",
    "for this reason , we decided to add this value to the initial hsra guess model .",
    "the stray - light profile in each map was computed averaging the stokes @xmath16 profiles of pixels without polarization signals .",
    "no more than four nodes in depth were necessary for any of the free parameters to achieve good fits to the four stokes profiles .",
    "the he i 10830    triplet originates between the lower term @xmath17 and the excited term @xmath18 of orthohelium .",
    "it comprises three spectral lines which are called the `` blue '' component at 10829.09     ( @xmath19 ) , and the ( blended ) `` red '' component at 10830.30  (@xmath20 ) .",
    "photospheric temperature enhancements in flares have been reported by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite using spectral lines in the visible .",
    "likewise , @xcite detected a near - infrared intensity enhancement of the continuum inside an x10 white - light flare . during our m3.2 class flare ,",
    "the hei stokes @xmath16 profile showed a very strong emission , the red component peaking at an intensity of @xmath21 , as seen in figure  [ fig : stokesprofs ] .",
    "though hei  10830    emission against the solar disk in flares has been previously seen by several authors , such large values have not been reported yet .",
    "previous studies showed intensity ratios to the continuum of @xmath22 for a m2.0 flare @xcite ; @xmath231.30 in the decay phase of a c9.7 flare ( fig . 1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; @xmath231.15 during a c2.0 flare ( fig . 2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these works did not show any associated hei stokes @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath0 profiles .",
    "figure [ fig : stokesprofs ] shows an illustrative example of the stokes profiles that corresponds to the maximum of the flare ( the exact position is marked by an arrow in figure  [ fig : maps ] )",
    ". remarkably , the amplitude of the circular polarization stokes @xmath0 profile from hei is larger than the one from sii . furthermore , since the linear polarization signals ( stokes @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) in si  i are also very small , the magnetic field is expected to be significantly stronger in the chromosphere than in the photosphere . note that the amplitude of the blue component of the he i stokes @xmath0 profile is significantly larger than the one of the red component .",
    "typically both profiles have similar amplitudes or even the blue component has a smaller amplitude .",
    "in addition , while the @xmath0-profile of the blue component looks normal ( i.e , rather antisymmetric ) , that of the red component seems distorted , especially its red lobe .",
    "this might indicate that the stokes @xmath0 shown in the figure is a combination of at least two emission profiles .",
    "the observed reversal of the stokes @xmath0 profiles of hei with respect to sii is due to the hei spectral line appearing in emission , whereas the sii line appears in absorption .",
    "in fact , the sii line never goes into emission in our data series , although it becomes noticeably shallower during the flare , as demonstrated by the comparison with the average quiet - sun spectrum plotted in figure  [ fig : stokesprofs ] .",
    "this is the result of the heating of photospheric layers produced by the flare .",
    "the components of the hei triplet appear redshifted with respect to their wavelength positions at rest ( vertical dotted lines in figure  [ fig : stokesprofs ] ) , suggesting that at the flare peak , the plasma is slightly moving downwards towards the photosphere .",
    "two peaks in stokes @xmath16 can be distinguished in the usually blended red component of he  i , one of them is slightly redshifted . during the flare ,",
    "many pixels show clear linear polarization signals in both the red and blue components of he  i 10830     ( e.g. , stokes @xmath25 in figure  [ fig : stokesprofs ] ) , which can not be easily interpreted as zeeman or scattering signatures .",
    "these anomalous polarization patterns will be discussed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the hei emission pattern is used here as an indicator of the flare eruption . to study the underlying photosphere , we concentrate on the sii line inversions .",
    "this line is sensitive to a range of various heights within the photosphere .",
    "however , we will focus on a layer corresponding to the granular height which is well represented by @xmath26 .",
    "slit - reconstructed monochromatic intensity images centered at the red component of the hei line are presented in the first row of figure [ fig : maps ] .",
    "these maps just represent the part of the full scanned field of view covered by the main part of the flare emission . from these images ,",
    "it can be easily seen when the flare activates the hei emission ( where @xmath27 ) .",
    "the second row shows the photospheric magnetic field strength , as derived from the inversion of the sii line .",
    "we will focus on the area inside the box which corresponds to the flare maximum , as indicated by the hei emission . in the first column ,",
    "i.e. , before the flare started , the photospheric magnetic field inside the box shows a patchy pattern of strong fields .",
    "however , during the flare ( second column ) , the field strength globally decreased being even absent in some areas .",
    "interestingly , in the post - flare panel ( third column ) , the magnetic field has partially recovered its strength and pattern .",
    "hence , there is clear evidence that the photospheric magnetic field changes during the flare and afterwards tries to recover its initial configuration .",
    "a further inspection of the stokes profiles reveals that the larger magnetic field strength in the pre- and post - flare maps is mainly due to the larger amplitude of the stokes @xmath0 profiles .",
    "the second map after the flare ( fourth column ) shows that the magnetic field is again losing strength and its pattern looks more like the one which corresponded to the flare .",
    "these fluctuations may indicate that the magnetic field may be undergoing temporal variations with a long relaxation time of hours .    as for the doppler velocities presented in the last row of figure [ fig : maps ] , a granular pattern , i.e.",
    ", a mix of up and downflows is seen in the pre - flare panel . in response to the flare",
    ", the second panel shows a large area of upflows .",
    "hence , photospheric material is predominantly pushed upwards where the flare occurs . the first post - flare panel still shows mainly upflows but a granular pattern is already distinguishable . in the last panel",
    "the granulation pattern is re - established .",

    "we have shown a very remarkable and unusual data set including pre- , flare , and post - flare slit scans in the infrared hei 10830  spectral region of an m3.2 class flare with the spectropolarimeter tip - ii .",
    "our observations reveal complex stokes @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath0 profiles of the chromospheric hei 10830 triplet during the flare . furthermore , unprecedented large intensity ratios to the continuum of the hei red component where shown ( @xmath38 ) . however , the hei emission is not associated with the whole area covered by the flare , as already detected by previous studies @xcite . from the sii inversions",
    "we have inferred the magnetic fields and the los velocities in the photosphere for the pre- , flare , and post - flare phases .",
    "there are roughly 30 minutes between the flare and the post - flare observations .",
    "as seen in the color scale in figure [ fig : maps ] , the magnetic field goes through changes of up to 1500  g in 30 minutes .",
    "these changes mainly happen in the box outlined in figure [ fig : maps ] , which lies between the upper two pores and the lower pil .",
    "the maximum of the flare is neither located at the sunspot nor at the pil of the active region . in our data sets , it was found that 90 minutes seemed to be an upper limit for the time needed by the magnetic field strength to recover most of its pre - flare pattern and strength .",
    "however , the variations of the magnetic field are not permanent .",
    "there is a strong decrease during the flare , with areas where the magnetic field was present before the flare but is completely absent during the evolution of this phenomenon .",
    "table [ tab : vel ] shows some parameters inferred from the photospheric inversions in the flaring part of the region ( represented by the box of figure [ fig : maps ] ) , at the layer at @xmath39 . before the flare occurs , a downflow of around 160  ms@xmath4 is present in the average granular velocity . during the flare and immediately after it , the granular pattern appears very distorted and barely perceptible , with an average upflow of some 100  ms@xmath4 .",
    "later , in the last map , the granulation pattern is almost recovered with an average downflow slightly below 100  ms@xmath4 .",
    "this evolution is compatible with a scenario where , once the flare has started , the deep photospheric material heats up and evaporates at a rate of @xmath1  g@xmath3s@xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : massflux ] shows the average dependence with depth of the evaporation rate of the photosphere in the flaring region . from this stratification , the density change in the chromosphere can be estimated from the continuity equation :      where we have assumed that the material motion is essentially vertical and the measured los velocity , @xmath41 , does not differ significantly from the true vertical velocity . integrating equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) in height from the temperature minimum ( @xmath42 ) up to the top of the atmosphere ( @xmath43 ) ,",
    "one gets      where @xmath45 is the column mass density of the chromosphere . further assuming that the rate of change of the density is constant during the flare and that no mass escapes away ( @xmath46 ) , then the time interval required to produce a change @xmath47 in the column density is      we can evaluate @xmath49 as the mass flux at the top of our photospheric inversions ( i.e. , @xmath2 g@xmath3s@xmath4 ; see figure [ fig : massflux ] ) . for the aforementioned hsra model atmosphere , the chromospheric column density ( i.e , integrating the density from the temperature minimum up to @xmath50  km ) is @xmath51 g@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , according to equation  ( [ eq:3 ] ) , the chromospheric density may increase by a factor of two ( @xmath52 ) in @xmath53  seconds .",
    "one hour after the flare , matter condenses again down to the photosphere .",
    "the magnetic field maps indicate that while the flare is taking place , most of the photospheric magnetic field is below detectable limits .",
    "one may speculate that the heating process has caused an increase of the gas pressure , thus producing an expansion of the magnetic structures and reducing their field strength .",
    "as the material evaporates , the gas pressure decreases gradually and the magnetic field tends to concentrate again trying to recover its original strength .",
    "however , the mass downflow observed during the last map may tend to increase again the gas pressure , leading again to an expansion of the magnetic field lines .",
    "this speculative scenario may explain at the same time the observed variations of the magnetic field strength and velocities during the pre- , flare , and post - flare phases .",
