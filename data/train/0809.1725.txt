    "ngc 7419 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , is a moderately populated young and heavily reddened galactic star cluster in cepheus with a large number of be stars .",
    "the cluster contains high mass ( @xmath17 ) ; intermediate mass ( @xmath18 ) and low - mass ( @xmath19 ) stars .",
    "it is therefore an ideal laboratory for the study of initial stellar mass distribution as well as duration of star formation process in a molecular cloud .",
    "presence of statistically significant number of herbig ae / be stars in the cluster makes it very attractive for understanding the formation of these stars and origin of various atmospheric activities like emission and x - ray emission in them .",
    "however , to address these questions in detail , one would like to know accurate distance and age parameters of the cluster ngc 7419 , which is lacking despite a number of photometric and spectroscopic studies .",
    "this is mainly because of the fact that the cluster is heavily reddened in comparison to the nearby clusters situated at the similar distances , and suffers from variable reddening .    in order to determine cluster reddening reliably",
    ", accurate @xmath20 broadband photometry of early type stars is essential .",
    "a comparison of the photometries available in the literature indicates that @xmath21 data , many have systematic calibration error .",
    "for example , @xcite have mentioned that their color may have an offset of @xmath22 mag due to the calibration problems in @xmath23 band .",
    "their photometric observations have been carried out in the poor seeing ( @xmath24 ) conditions .",
    "this will affect cluster photometric data particularly in the crowded regions .",
    "the main goals of present study are to determine the distance , age and its spread , and mass function ( mf ) of the cluster as accurate as possible .",
    "this will help us to understand the star formation history of the cluster , and to investigate the x - ray emission properties of herbig ae / be stars .",
    "deep optical observations ( @xmath25 mag ) , narrow band photometric observations along with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , infrared all sky survey ( iras ) , midcourse space experiment ( msx ) and xmm - newton archival data are used to understand the x - ray emission properties of herbig ae / be stars , and the global scenario of star formation in the cluster ngc 7419 and its surrounding region .",
    "@xcite has reported the distance of this cluster as @xmath8 6 kpc based on the @xmath26 photometric observations .",
    "a similar value for cluster distance has also been obtained by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite has obtained a significantly smaller distance of 3.3 kpc .",
    "using ccd data , a distance of 2.0 kpc and 2.3 kpc was estimated by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the age estimated by @xcite is @xmath8 40 myr while @xcite have estimated a much younger age of @xmath8 14 myr .",
    "recent ccd observations reported by @xcite estimated its distance as 2.9 kpc and an age of 2025 myr .",

    "finally , the x - ray data and its analysis ( for the first time ) are described in  [ sec : xradat ] , followed by the summary and conclusions in  [ sec : sumcon ] .",
    "the optical observations of ngc 7419 were carried out using a thinned back - illuminated ccd camera mounted at f/13 cassegrain focus of the 104-cm sampurnanand reflector telescope of aryabhatta research institute of observational sciences , nainital .",
    "a @xmath27 m square pixel of the @xmath28 size ccd detector corresponds to 038 and the entire chip covers a field of about @xmath29 on the sky . in order to improve the signal to noise ratio , observations were taken in binned mode of @xmath30 pixel .",
    "the gain and readout noise of the ccd are 10 electron per analog - to - digital unit and 5.3 electron , respectively .",
    "the journal of optical observations is given in table  [ tab : optlog ] .",
    "broad band johnson @xmath20 , cousins @xmath26 and , narrow band line ( @xmath31 nm ) and continuum ( @xmath32 nm ) filters were used for observations .",
    "the narrow band filters had a full width at half maximum of 8 nm .",
    "several bias and twilight flat field frames in all the filters were taken to clean the images .",
    "multiple long and short exposures were obtained for the cluster region .",
    "we observed 12 stars in @xcite standards field ( sa98 ) covering a range in brightness ( @xmath33 ) as well as in color ( @xmath34 ) for calibrating the cluster observations .",
    "the airmass range is covered from 1.1 to 2.0 for the @xcite standards , which was used for extinction determinations .",
    "the photometric ccd data were reduced using the iraf and eso midas data reduction packages .",
    "photometry of the bias - subtracted and flat - fielded ccd frames was carried out using daophot - ii software @xcite .",

    "we have ignored the second - order color correction terms as they are generally small in comparison to the internal photometric errors as given by daophot .",
    "the photometric errors as a function of brightness range are given in table  [ tab : errors ] .",
    "it can be seen that the errors become large ( @xmath45mag ) for stars fainter than @xmath46 mag , and hence the measurements beyond this magnitude are less reliable and are not considered in further analysis . at @xmath47 band , we could detect 1817 stars in @xmath29 region and their photometric magnitudes are given in table  [ tab : datasample ] ( available only in electronic form ) .",

    "this reddening variation ( @xmath120 mag ) for cluster members is well above the typical width of intrinsic main - sequence stars i.e. @xmath121 mag , which is caused usually due to photometric accuracy and the presence of binary stars @xcite .",
    "it therefore indicates the presence of variable reddening within the cluster region , which is also reported by @xcite .",
    "few emission - line stars ( open circles ) are found to have @xmath122 mag and these may either be embedded deep in the parent cloud or be surrounded with circumstellar matter . using iterative q - method (  [ sec : lawred ] ) , we derive mean value of @xmath123 as @xmath124 mag , which is same as estimated visually by color - color diagram , and hence we adopt this value in our further analysis .",

    "thus , using the visual - fit method , the present data finds the turn - off age of the cluster to lie between 19 myr to 25 myr and hence we assign an age of @xmath126 myr .",
    "we also estimate age using morphological age method @xcite , which employes color - index parameter ( cip ) , defined as the difference in the color index between the blue turnoff point of the main - sequence and the color at the base of the red giant branch . for ngc 7419 ,",
    "cip is calculated as 1.654 mag and it represents the age between 20 and 25 myrs , which is in good agreement with our previous value . the present age estimate is similar to the one derived by @xcite less than the 50 myr given by @xcite and older than 14 myr derived by @xcite .      the zero - age main - sequence fitting procedure ( figure  [ fig : cmdall ] ) is used to derive the distance of the cluster and the distance modulus is estimated as @xmath127 mag which corresponds to a distance of @xmath128 pc .",
    "the distance determination is further performed using a maximum likelihood @xmath129-minimization method which employes fitting two - dimensional distributions to stellar data in color magnitude space @xcite .",
    "this takes into account the effects of binary population as well as observed photometric errors .",
    "assuming an age of @xmath130 myr and a binary fraction of 0.5 , the best - fit padova isochrone with solar metallicity yields a distance modulus of 12.55 mag ( figure  [ fig : cmdtau],[sec : colmag ] ) .",
    "emission - line stars were excluded from this fit . adding a systematic error of 0.28 mag due to differential reddening to each data point",

    "a comparison of the xlfs of t - tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars with the cluster members are shown in figure  [ fig : xlf ] .",
    "the x - ray upper limits indicate that the herbig ae / be stars in ngc 7419 are not systematically more active than t - tauri in taurus - auriga region and herbig ae / be stars in @xcite .",
    "but the median value of xlf of herbig ae / be stars in @xcite is more than the upper limits in the cluster .",

    "however , the more important conclusion to draw from this analysis is that the herbig ae / be stars in ngc 7419 are not as active as in the sample of @xcite .       and @xmath218 , respectively .",

    "pn data were not used since chip gaps , bad columns , and the the out - of - time event correction would have complicated the analysis . we have created the mos images and associated exposure maps in three bands : soft band ( 0.3  0.7 kev ) , medium band ( 0.7  1.2 kev ) and hard band ( 1.2  7.5 kev ) . we have chosen adaptive smoothstyle with signal - to - noise ratio 10 in the task @xmath267 , for getting the faint emission from the cluster region . the resulting mosaic image with point sources",

    "the point sources are removed from the image using cheesemask but the background is not subtracted from it .    the signature of extended emission is not present in the soft band ( 0.3  0.7 kev ) and medium band ( 0.7  1.2 kev ) images of the mos , because of the the absorption of the soft x - ray component due to the large hydrogen column density ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "all the probable point sources have hard spectra , therefore , it is very likely that the extended emission is due to unresolved hard x - ray sources in the cluster .",
    "the x - ray contour map of the diffuse x - ray emission in energy band 1.2  7.5 kev is shown in figure  [ fig : diffuse ] .",
    "the entire cluster region is covered by the central ccd of the mos , therefore , we have chosen background regions of 22745 pixels beyond the diffuse emission but within the central ccd .",

    "it can be explained by the presence of @xmath8 288 t - tauri stars in the cluster , which are not resolved by xmm - newton observatory .",
    "higher resolution ( sub arcsec ) data are urgently required to explore this issue .",
    "we have examined a sample of 21 herbig ae / be in this cluster using 2mass data , photometry and the spectroscopic studies reported by @xcite . however , none of herbig ae / be stars has an x - ray counterpart . in figure  [ fig : diffuseopt ] , the distribution of the x - ray point sources which are having optical counterparts , supergiants ( 5 in number ) and the herbig ae / be stars within the cluster are shown by black open circles ( with i d from table  [ tab : xraysrc ] ) , black open squares and white open circles , respectively .    the detection limit analysis  [ sec : detlimit ] and the xlf ( figure  [ fig : xlf ] ) indicate that the @xmath264 observed from the low mass pre - main - sequence stars is less than upper limits of the detection ( see , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , if a herbig star is having a t - tauri star as a binary companion , then we can not detect the x - ray emission from it .",
    "therefore , the generation of x - ray emission from herbig ae / be stars ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "a similar kind of process as in t - tauri stars could then take place in the herbig ae / be stars for the generation of x - rays .",
    "a deep optical @xmath105 and narrow band observations along with multi - wavelength archival data from the surveys such as 2mass , msx , iras and xmm - newton are used to understand the global scenario of star formation and the basic parameters of the cluster ngc 7419 .",
    "xmm - newton archival data have also been used to study the x - ray emission mechanism from the cluster .",
    "the radius of the cluster ngc 7419 has been found to be 40@xmath8005 using radial density profile .",
    "the reddening law in the direction of the cluster is found to be normal at longer wavelengths but anomalous at shorter wavelengths .",
    "reddening , @xmath118 , is found to be varying between 1.5 to 1.9 mag with a mean value @xmath281 mag .",
    "the turn - off age and the distance of the cluster are estimated to be @xmath126 myr and @xmath282 , respectively .",
    "the mf for the main - sequence stars in the cluster is estimated as having @xmath283 in the mass range @xmath284 , which is a similar to the @xcite value .",
    "effect of mass segregation is found in the main - sequence stars which may be the result of dynamical evolution .    using the nir color - color diagram and narrow band @xmath139 observations ,",

    "the ages of these herbig ae / be stars are found to be in the range of @xmath8 0.3 to 2.0 myr .",
    "the significant difference between turn - off age and turn - on age of the cluster represents a second episode of star formation in the cluster .",
    "we have found 90 ysos having masses in the range from 0.1 to @xmath286 with the help of nir color - color diagram around the cluster .",
    "the presence of such a large number of nir excess sources ( t - tauri stars ) shows a recent star formation episode in the surroundings of the cluster region . using extinction , dust and @xmath167co maps",
    ", we found that these ysos are probably associated with a foreground star forming region sh-154 and not related with the cluster region .",
    "we found no obvious trend in spatial distribution of ysos with @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath171 and @xmath172 is also very low which indicates that a majority of the ysos are born at the same time in the same environment .",
    "therefore , it is possible that primordial fragmentation of the cloud may be responsible for the formation of the low mass stars within this cloud .",
    "we have detected 66 x - ray sources in the observed field by xmm - newton observatory using archival x - ray data .",
    "out of these sources , 23 are knowm to be the probable members of the cluster based on analysis of their x - ray colors .",
    "fifteen x - ray sources are without any optical or nir counterparts",
    ". these may be the young embedded sources which need to be investigated further .",
    "we have derived the detection limits of x - ray observations based on the position of the x - ray source in the field of view and on its energy spectrum .",
    "thus , the median value for the detection limit for the 21 hebig ae / be stars in the field is @xmath287@xmath288 .",
    "we have compared the xlf for the cluster members with the t - tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars . because of insufficient exposure and resolution , the sensitivity was not enough to reach the level of the median x - ray luminosity observed in t - tauri stars in taurus - auriga region and herbig ae / be stars in @xcite .",
    "therefore a conclusive comparison of x - ray properties of the stars can not be made .",
    "however , the comparison indicates that herbig ae / be stars in ngc 7419 tend to be less x - ray luminous than in the sample of @xcite , which shows that x - ray activity level of the herbig ae / be stars is not more than in the t - tauri stars .",
    "therefore , we can support the binary t - tauri companion hypothesis for the generation of x - rays in herbig ae / be stars .",
    "it is also possible that a herbig ae / be star is itself emitting x - rays but the level of the x - ray emission is similar to that of the t - tauri stars .",
    "the cluster region shows an extended x - ray emission with a total luminosity estimated to be @xmath289",
    ". this diffuse emission might be the result of x - ray emission from t - tauri type stars which could not be resolved by xmm - newton observations .",
