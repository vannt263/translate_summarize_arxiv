    "the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) of the muon , @xmath4 , constitutes a high precision observable extremely sensitive to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "its current experimental value @xmath5 differs from the sm theoretical prediction @xmath6 by  @xcite @xmath7 evidently , the deviation @xmath8 is at the @xmath9 confidence level ( cl ) and has therefore been called the _ muon anomaly_. consequently , an important constraint on model - building is derived by requiring that new - physics contributions to  @xmath4 are smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "likewise , the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron , @xmath11 , is a very sensitive probe for cp violation induced by new cp phases beyond the sm .",
    "the present upper limit on @xmath11 is quoted to be  @xcite @xmath12 future projected experiments utilizing paramagnetic systems , such as cesium , rubidium and francium , may extend the current sensitivity to the @xmath13@xmath14  level  ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in the sm , the predictions for @xmath11 range from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , depending on whether the dirac cp phase in the light neutrino mixing is zero or not  @xcite .",
    "clearly , an observation of a non - zero value for  @xmath11 , much larger than @xmath17 , would signify cp - violating physics beyond the sm .    as an archetypal model of new physics , the so - called minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "is of great interest . in general , models of softly broken supersymmetry ( susy ) at the 110  tev scale , such as the mssm ,",
    "can account for the gauge hierarchy problem , predict rather accurate unification of gauge couplings near the grand unification theory ( gut ) scale , naturally explain the origin of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the sm gauge group and predict viable candidates for solving the dark matter ( dm ) problem in the universe . for a recent review ,",
    "see  @xcite .    to account for the observed light neutrino masses and mixings",
    ", we will consider susy extensions  @xcite to models with low - scale heavy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "specifically , the mssm extended with low - scale right - handed neutrino superfields , which we denote hereafter as @xmath18 , predicts additional contributions to charged lepton flavour violation ( clfv ) that do not exist in models with high - scale heavy neutrinos and are independent of the soft susy - breaking mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the @xmath19 , @xmath20-boson penguins @xcite and box diagrams @xcite dominate the amplitudes of processes , such as lepton@xmath21leptons and @xmath22 conversion , whereas photon - penguin lfv diagrams are sub - dominant and become only relevant to models with ultra - heavy neutrinos close to the gut scale  @xcite . in particular , our recent analysis has shown  @xcite that a significant region of the @xmath23 parameter space exists for which the branching ratios of clfv processes are predicted to be close to the current experimental sensitivities , despite the fact that the soft susy - breaking scale has been pushed to values higher than @xmath24  tev , as a consequence of the discovery of a sm - like higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and the existing non - observation limits on the gluino and squark masses that were also deduced from lhc data  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of particular interest to investigate here , whether the effects of low - scale heavy neutrinos and their susy partners , the sneutrinos , contribute in a relevant manner to other high precision observables , such as the muon anomalous mdm @xmath4 and the electron edm @xmath11 .",
    "we believe that the announced higher - precision measurement of  @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath25 in the future fermilab experiment e989 @xcite and the expected future sensitivities of the electron edm down to the level of @xmath26 @xcite , renders such an investigation both very interesting and timely .",
    "most studies on lepton dipole moments have been devoted to susy models realizing a high scale seesaw mechanism @xcite . here instead",
    ", we consider the @xmath27 which provides potentially significant contributions to lepton dipole moments due to low - scale neutrinos and sneutrinos , as well as new sources of cp violation .",
    "in particular , an interesting possibility emerges if there exists cp violation beyond the sm which is sourced from the singlet sector of the @xmath23 .",
    "this new cp violation may originate from a complex soft trilinear sneutrino parameter @xmath28 , or from a complex soft bilinear parameter @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , one may have new cp - odd phases residing in the @xmath30 neutrino yukawa - coupling matrix @xmath31 . assuming that these are the only additional non - zero cp - odd phases in the @xmath27 , we find that the electron edm is testable , but naturally small , typically of order @xmath32 , thereby avoiding to some extent the well - known problem of too large cp violation , from which susy extensions of the sm , such as the mssm ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , usually suffer .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our conventions and notation for the lepton dipole moments , as well as describe the new sources of cp violation that we are considering in the @xmath27 . section  iii presents our numerical estimates for the lepton dipole moments @xmath4 and @xmath11 . to this end , we specify our input parameters , including the neutrino yukawa matrices adopted in our numerical analysis .",
