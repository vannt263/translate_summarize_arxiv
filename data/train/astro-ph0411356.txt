    "the unexpected measurement of ultraviolet light in the metal rich populations of bulges and spheroids was one of the early important discoveries in space astronomy @xcite .",
    "initial suggestions that the ultraviolet rising flux ( or uvx ) was caused by low level star formation or nuclear activity gave way to the current view , that evolved stars are responsible for the uvx . while not arising from recent star formation , the stellar population responsible for the uvx in early type galaxies has eluded convincing identification among the resolved stars in globular clusters and other nearby populations . early theoretical work aimed at solving the mystery ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "favors evolved stars as the source , with helium burning stars being both luminous enough , and sufficiently long lived , to be plausible candidates .",
    "recent observations of nearby galaxies support this view .",
    "modeling integrated spectra of nearby uvx galaxies , @xcite argue against post - agb stars as the dominant contributor .",
    "direct imaging of m32 @xcite finds fewer than expected luminous uv stars ( and a striking lack of post - agb stars ) firming support for the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) hypothesis .",
    "recent reviews considering the problem of the uvx are given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "one of the core observational results is the correlation of the uv rising flux with metallicity and velocity dispersion ( @xcite;bbbfl ) .",
    "bbbfl show that the nuclear populations of 24 early - type galaxies with optical spectra indicating no signs of agn or star formation exhibit a strong correlation between uvx ( in the form of a @xmath3 color ) and the lick @xmath2 metallicity index , a result which strongly influenced theoretical efforts to explain the uvx .",
    "the discovery of very blue horizontal branch stars in the metal rich globular clusters ngc 6388 and 6441 @xcite shows that uv bright stars are present even in some old metal rich populations .",
    "the presence of a correlation between uvx and independent measurable parameters not only gives a clue to the source of the uvx , but also could be exploited to gain insight into the evolution of the uvx with lookback time .",
    "if the source of the uvx is hot horizontal branch stars , theoretical models ( e.g. @xcite ) expect a rapid decline as a function of lookback time , because only within the last few gyr have the masses of old turnoff stars been low enough that the helium burning progeny of rgb tip stars would have envelopes thin enough to make the stars uv bright . to make possible the study of the uvx in large samples , or distant galaxies , we seek correlations in properties measurable from integrated light .",
    "recent observations have begun to weaken the assertion of a strong primary correlation between uvx and metallicity .",
    "@xcite use the film - based imaging of the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "@xcite to find far - uv color gradients in early - type galaxies , in the sense of redder colors in the optically bluer , outer parts of ellipticals",
    ". however , this study finds a range in color gradients and no clear trend with the lick @xmath2 index .",
    "@xcite form a color using @xmath4 as measured from the balloon - borne _ foca _ mission @xcite and plot this against the @xmath2 index for early - type galaxies .",
    "they find no correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath2 for the early - type galaxies in their sample .",
    "however , they do not spectroscopically screen against galaxies with agn and weak star formation and , most significantly , the uvx dominates _ blueward _ of 2000 , in the satellite ultraviolet .",
    "the successful launch of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ has made possible the construction of a significantly larger sample of early - type galaxies with which to probe the behavior of uvx than was possible for bbbfl .",
    "the observations above the atmosphere permit measurement of the uvx in the optimal window where it is most prominent , from @xmath5 .",
    "the satellite and its operations are described in this volume @xcite .    in this _",
    "letter _ we explore the relationship between the uvx ( in the form of integrated light @xmath1 and metallicity ) for a sample of galaxies considerably more distant than was considered in bbbfl , but nonetheless early - type galaxies in the relatively local universe @xmath6 .",
    "we use the @xmath1 color as the best proxy for the @xmath3 color of bbbfl , given that sdss @xmath7 is generally measured with higher s / n and has a smaller k - correction than sdss @xmath8 .",
    "we aim to combine galex and sdss data for a sample of early - type galaxies with no optical signs of star formation , nuclear activity , or disturbed morphology .",
    "we require that the galaxies have sdss spectra with high enough s / n to assure neither detectable @xmath9 nor k+a type spectra will enter this sample .",
    "these `` quiescent '' early - type ( qe ) galaxies are selected based on morphology and spectroscopy .",
    "we begin by selecting candidates from the sdss dr1 spectroscopic sample that are consistent with early - type morphology and basic spectral shape .",
    "we draw our sample from objects photometrically classified as galaxies , and use essentially the same criteria used by @xcite : a ) @xmath10 , the high ratio of radii capturing 90 and 50% of the petrosian flux ( also known as concentration ) ensures that most early - type galaxies are selected ( but with sizable late - type contamination ) ; b ) @xmath11 selects objects whose likelihood of a devaucouleurs ( @xmath12 ) profile in @xmath7-band is 3% higher than the exponential profile ; c ) @xmath13 ( spectral template fitting coefficient obtained from principal component analysis of spectra ) additionally ensures that objects with spectra inconsistent with early - type galaxies are not selected ( note that eclass corresponds to negative @xmath14 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we ask that spectra have s / n  @xmath15 in @xmath7-band .",
    "unlike @xcite we do not require that the zwarning flag not be set , nor do we impose a redshift cut at this stage .",
    "these criteria yield 54950 candidates , or some 40% of all dr1 galaxies with spectra . for these galaxies",
    "we retrieve dereddened petrosian magnitudes and their errors , velocity dispersion measurements , and various other parameters .    for these galaxies , we measure lick @xmath16 and d4000 indices ( using the @xcite definition ) , using a special purpose analysis pipeline ( see @xcite for details ) . also , by measuring the residual nebular emission lines left from the subtraction of a stellar continuum model @xcite we can classify these galaxies using a bpt plot @xcite into star - forming galaxies ( 3% ) , star - forming galaxies with weak s / n features ( 13% ) , galaxies that show both star forming and agn features ( composites , 8% ) , and agns ( 19% ) .",
    "the remainder comprises galaxies with @xmath17 in h@xmath18 , i.e. no measurable lines permitting classification in any of the above categories .",
    "this is our core sample of `` quiescent '' early - type galaxies .",
    "they represent 57% of our sample ( yet just 30% of the full dr1 are quiescent early - type galaxies ) .",
    "galex images the sky in the far and near uv ( 1530   and 2310  ) in two modes : all - sky imaging survey ( ais , @xmath19 ) and medium - deep imaging survey ( mis , @xmath20 ) .",
    "each circular field covers 1.1 sq.deg . @xcite",
    "have performed sdss dr1/galex matching of objects in galex internal release ( ir 0.2 ) catalog , consisting of 649 ais and 94 mis fields , of which 117 and 91 overlap ( not always entirely ) with sdss dr1 .",
    "we include an additional field ( not in ir0.2 ) on the cluster of galaxies abell 2670 @xmath21 .",
    "thus our total overlap with sdss dr1 is @xmath22 sq .",
    "deg . , or some 10% of dr1 spectroscopic footprint .",
    "we use @xmath23 and @xmath24 magnitudes and errors derived in an elliptical aperture .",
    "we cross - correlate our 54950 early - type candidates from dr1 with galex objects having sdss spectroscopic counterparts ( 10357 objects ) and obtain 2174 objects in common .",
    "we discard 120 galaxies with @xmath25 because of our compromised ability to classify them , and due to the 2 gyr lookback time .",
    "we also exclude 24 objects not classified spectroscopically as galaxies .",
    "this leaves us with 2038 galaxies with acceptable sdss and galex data , with morphology and basic spectral shape consistent with early - type galaxies , and with @xmath0 .",
    "we then subject this sample to further scrutiny using the bpt classification outlined above .",
    "now the star forming ( sf ) galaxies constitute 6% , low - s /",
    "n sf 17% , composites 15% , agns 27% , and the remaining , quiescent early - types ( qe ) , 35% of the sample . since galex is sensitive to uv light from young stars and nuclear activity , it is not surprising that the quiescent galaxies have fallen in proportion with respect to sdss - only sample .",
    "although we initially select all of these five classes as early - type candidates , many of the non - qe galaxies ( especially sf ) are obviously late - types .",
    "their inclusion in the candidate list is often times due to the presence of a dominant bulge , with a relatively faint disk .    in our analysis",
    "we will primarily be concerned with galaxies that exhibit fuv flux .",
    "of our 2038 galaxies , only one - half ( 1032 ) have detectable ( @xmath26 ) fuv flux .",
    "it is these galaxies that are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "however , in this fuv - selected sample , qe comprise only 18% , or 189 objects .",
    "these optically `` old red and dead '' galaxies are the focus of our study .",
    "since , as we have seen , relying on just the morphological criteria is unreliable , and further considering that the fiber spectra ( in contrast to the integral fluxes ) sample only the central @xmath27 of a galaxy , we have visually inspected sdss images of these 189 galaxies . as a result of this",
    ", we find 17 objects that show hints of a structure : bars , weak spiral arms , or rings . while their classification as true early type galaxies is in doubt ,",
    "the colors of these objects are no bluer , nor their spectra suspect , compared to our main qe sample .",
    "we remove these objects from our final sample of 172 quiescent e / s0s with a detectable far - uv flux .",
    "roughly 1/2 of these galaxies lie closer than @xmath28 and the other half at @xmath29 .",
    "we visually inspected the spectra of the 172 qe galaxies , and find that they are homogeneous with no abnormalities consistent with the presence of a late burst of star formation not accompanied by @xmath9 emission .",
    "the s / n of the qe sample spectra is @xmath30 ( rms ) ; we are confident that we did not miss any significant emission .",
    "the lowest s / n quartile of our sample has fuv@xmath31 , while the highest s / n quartile has fuv@xmath32 .",
    "we attribute this difference to bright red nearby galaxies which drop out of the sample at @xmath33 .",
    "we first consider the uv - optical properties of the full sample of sdss dr1 galaxies with early - type morphology , spectra with s / n@xmath15 , and detections in the fuv band ( figure 1 ) .",
    "these plots show a weak correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , but in the sense that more metal rich galaxies are redder , opposite the trend of bbbfl .",
    "notably , galaxies with even weak spectroscopic signatures of star formation tend to have the bluest fuv colors and uniformly lower @xmath2 , and even lower d4000 ( not shown ) .",
    "the distribution of the agn and especially of star forming galaxies look similar in this plane , and clearly differs from that of the qe galaxies in the lowest panel , which mostly have @xmath34 , and very few galaxies with @xmath35 .",
    "averging @xmath2 for galaxies with @xmath36 , we find 0.16 for the star forming , 0.22 for the agn , and 0.24 for the qe .",
    "figure 2 concerns only possible correlations within the qe sample , now separated by redshift .",
    "we also identify members of abell 2670 which has also been investigated by @xcite to study the evolution of the uv rising flux . a rich cluster of galaxies with a large population of ellipticals , one might expect the galaxies in abell 2670 to be more uniform in their age of formation , and less affected by residual star formation , than are the field galaxies .",
    "we see no tendency to recover the bbbfl trends among the abell 2670 sample .",
    "the a2670 members appear to be uniformly more red than the field , both for the @xmath37 and @xmath29 subsets .",
    "in addition to @xmath2 , we consider the metallicity sensitive d4000 index ( the continuum drop below the ca hk lines is due to a large increase in metal lines , and is a metallicity sensitive index ) and with velocity dispersion ( mass ) .",
    "we find a weak correlation between @xmath1 and metallicity or mass , but in the opposite sense to that of bbbfl : more massive , metal rich galaxies have redder @xmath1 color .",
    "concerned by this failure to reproduce the bbbfl trends , we checked that the mg@xmath38 and d4000 correlate as expected , and that @xmath39 and @xmath2 correlate .",
    "we inspect visually each fuv detection and find a handful of cases where the uv emision is extended , even for galaxies in the qe sample ; removal of these from our sample has no effect . early type galaxies with @xmath40 are classified as residual star forming galaxies by @xcite in their study of the uv color - magnitude relation .",
    "they argue that such a strong uvx is inconsistent with that found in local samples ( e.g. bbbfl ) .",
    "we assert that our spectroscopic pre - selection and observed behavior in the d4000 and mg@xmath38 vs @xmath1 plots qualifies these as true uvx candidates .",
    "even if such galaxies were excised from the sample , our conclusions remain unaffected .",
    "the @xmath37 sample of qe galaxies appears to be redder in @xmath1 color than the @xmath29 sample .",
    "we have considered whether this could be due to a k correction by convolving the sdss and galex bandpasses with the appropriate quiescent evolving red metal rich population , constructed from the @xcite models .",
    "the k correction ( single burst population formed 13 gyr ago ) alone will cause an evolution of 0.3 mag to @xmath28 and 0.5 mag to @xmath41 ( a single burst stellar population formed at @xmath42 is already @xmath43 gyr old at @xmath41 ) .",
    "the difference in the color distribution may be related to rapid evolution of the uvx ( as is evidently also seen in @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider this and other issues in greater detail , later .",
    "however , we emphasize that we do not recover the bbbfl trends even for the lowest redshift subset of our data .",
    "surprising in light of their spectroscopic uniformity is the 5 mag range of @xmath44 .",
    "while half of our initial sample of early type galaxies was not detected in fuv , we verified that the bright end of our sample is sufficiently well detected in the fuv that the red limit is physical and not due to the reddest galaxies being undetected .",
    "the @xmath45 color may signal changes in the character of the underlying stellar population responsible for the uv upturn .",
    "figure 3 suggests that galaxies with the reddest @xmath1 ( weakest uvx ) also have redder @xmath45 colors .",
    "note that the qe galaxies are bluer than sf in @xmath45 : only 3% of the sf lack an nuv detection , while 16% of the qe galaxies lack nuv .    in light of our absence of a correlation between uvx and metallicity",
    ", it becomes difficult to invoke helium abundance ( entering through @xmath46 ) as the primary controlling parameter in the strength of the uvx .",
    "the wide variation in color and lack of correlation with an obvious physical property might reflect small variations in star formation history which affect the age distribution of the old stars , or with uvx arising from a rare population fed by stochastic mass loss on the first ascent of the red giant branch .",
    "the lookback time in our sample is not negligble . for the concordance cosmology of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ,",
    "the lookback time at @xmath28 is 1.3 gyr and reaches 2.4 gyr at @xmath41 .",
    "small differences in the formation time of our qe sample could correspond to observed diffferences of 1 - 2 gyr in age .",
    "well populated blue horizontal branches are found only in globular clusters with the age of the galactic halo .",
    "this observation is reflected in theoretical models ( e.g. @xcite ) which predict that the fuv flux should fade by 2 - 4 mag within the 2.4 gyr lookback time spanned by this sample .    _",
    "galex  _ continues its surveys , and we plan to exploit the overlap between these and the sdss dr2 , resulting in a large jump in sample size .",
    "normal science operations with _",
    "galex  _ did not begin until august 2003 , however , observations of the virgo cluster have now been obtained and we expect to be able to reproduce more closely the measurements of bbbfl both for nuclear and integrated light , for nearby early - type galaxies . the origin of the uv rising flux and its systematic behavior with physical properties remains a complicated and challenging problem , some 30 years after its discovery using the first orbiting ultraviolet telescope .",
