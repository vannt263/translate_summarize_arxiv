    "while the idea of hermann weyl to analyze spectra of quantum systems semiclassically , by looking at the phase space allowed for the corresponding classical motion , is one of the most seminal in modern mathematical physics , its validity is not universal .",
    "various examples of systems which have purely discrete spectrum despite the fact the respective phase space volume is infinite were constructed in the last three decades .",
    "a classical one belongs to b.  simon @xcite and describes a two - dimensional schrdinger operator with the potential @xmath6 having deep `` valleys '' the width of which is shrinking with the distance from the origin . a related problem concerns spectral properties of dirichlet laplacians in regions with hyperbolic cusps",
    " we refer to the recent paper @xcite for an up - to - date bibliographical survey .",
    "the aim of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we want to demonstrate that similar spectral behaviour can occur also for schrdinger operators with potentials unbounded from below .",
    "furthermore , we intend to construct a model which exhibit a nontrivial spectral transition as the coupling constant changes .",
    "specifically , we are going to consider here the following class of operators , @xmath7 on @xmath8 using the standard cartesian coordinate @xmath9 in @xmath10 ; the parameter @xmath3 controlling the second term of the potential is non - negative and we will not indicated it if it will be clear from the context . since @xmath11 the above operator is essentially self - adjoint on @xmath12 by faris - lavine theorem",
    "@xcite , thms .",
    "x.28 and x.38 ; in the following the symbol @xmath13 or @xmath14 will always mean its closure .    first we will show that there is a critical value of the coupling constant @xmath3 , expressed explicitly as ground - state eigenvalue of the corresponding ( an)harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , such that the spectrum of @xmath14 is below bounded and purely discrete for @xmath15 , while for @xmath5 it becomes unbounded from below . in the latter case one",
    "naturally expects it to be continuous covering the whole real axis but we will not proceed this way .",
    "the main result of the paper are upper and lower bounds to the sums of the first @xmath16 eigenvalues of @xmath14 in the subcritical case proved in sec .",
    "[ s : estimates ] .",
    "they give the same asymptotics up to a multiplicative constant if @xmath17 , while for @xmath18 this remains true for the leading term but an additional one , linear in @xmath16 , is added in the lower bound .",
    "the proof of the upper bound is reduced to the case @xmath17 , hence it is not surprising the result holds for any @xmath15 . on the other hand , the argument which yields the lower bound is more subtle and we have been able to prove the result for sufficiently small values of @xmath3 only leaving room for improvement , see theorem  [ th : lowerbound ] below . in the closing section",
    "we prove also a lower bound to spectral sums of the operator @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the dirichlet laplacian on the region with hyperbolic cusps ; formally speaking this can be regarded as the limit @xmath22 of the problem ( [ operator ] ) .",
    "the first important observation is that spectral properties of the operator @xmath14 depend crucially on the value of the parameter @xmath3 ; we have to distinguish two cases .",
    "the spectral regime we are primarily interested in occurs for small values of @xmath3 . to characterize the smallness quantitatively",
    "we need an auxiliary operator which will be an ( an)harmonic oscillator hamiltonian on line , @xmath23 on @xmath24 with the standard domain .",
    "let @xmath25 be the minimal eigenvalue of this operator ; in view of the potential symmetry we have @xmath26 , where @xmath27 on @xmath28 with neumann condition at @xmath29 .",
    "this quantity is well known  cf .",

    "we have the following result .",
    "[ thm : subcrit ] for any @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , the operator @xmath14 has a purely discrete spectrum bounded from below for any @xmath1 .    by the minimax principle it is sufficient to estimate @xmath13 from below by a self - adjoint operator with a purely discrete spectrum . to construct such a lower bound",
    "we employ bracketing imposing additional neumann condition at concentric circles of radii @xmath37 .",
    "using the standard polar coordinates , we obtain thus a direct sum of operators acting as @xmath38 on the annular regions @xmath39 .",
    "each of the latter is compact and the potential is regular on it , hence @xmath40 is purely discrete .",
    "it is sufficient therefore to check that @xmath41 as @xmath42 , because then the spectrum of @xmath43 below any fixed value is a finite union of discrete spectra which implies the sought claim .    the argument can further simplified if we estimate @xmath44 from below by an operator with separating variables acting , for instance , as @xmath45 the spectrum of which is the `` sum '' of the radial and angular component .",
    "furthermore , the lowest radial eigenfunction is zero corresponding to a constant eigenfunction , hence the problem reduces to analysis of the angular component of the above operator ; using the mirror symmetries of the potential it is enough to consider in on @xmath46 with neumann conditions at the endpoints of the interval .    to simplify things",
    "further we take an arbitrary @xmath47 and introduce the following ordinary differential operator on @xmath46 , @xmath48 with neumann boundary conditions , @xmath49 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath50 large enough , specifically @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , hence it is sufficient to investigate the spectral threshold @xmath53 of @xmath54 .",
    "we employ one more estimate from below . to a fixed @xmath55",
    "there is @xmath56 such that @xmath57 holds for @xmath58 .",
    "we consider the operator @xmath59}(x)+ \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi } \\right)^p\\chi_{[\\delta(\\varepsilon),\\pi/4)}(x)\\right ) -\\lambda_\\varepsilon'\\,n^{(4p+4)/(p+2)}\\ ] ] with neumann boundary conditions , where @xmath60 , and denote its lowest inequality as @xmath61 . in view of the inequality @xmath62 we have @xmath63 , and thus @xmath64 , by the minimax principle .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to check that @xmath65 it is straightforward to check that the operator @xmath66 without the last term is by a simple scaling transformation , @xmath67 , unitarily equivalent to the @xmath68 multiple of the operator @xmath69}(t)+\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^p\\chi_{[\\nu_p \\delta(\\varepsilon),\\nu_p\\pi/4)}(t)\\right)\\ ] ] on @xmath70 with neumann conditions at the endpoints of the interval , where @xmath71 .",
    "spectrum of the above operator is purely discrete , and denoting by @xmath72 its lowest eigenvalue , we thus have @xmath73 furthermore , we have @xmath74 where the estimating operators act as ( [ osc_bound ] ) with additional neumann and dirichlet condition , respectively , at the point @xmath75 . for large enough @xmath50 the ground state of",
    "both the estimating operators come from the `` inner '' part , @xmath76 , and one can check explicitly that @xmath77 as @xmath42 for both @xmath78 , where @xmath25 is the ground state of ( [ halfoscillator ] ) , and therefore @xmath79 as @xmath42 .",
    "this further implies that to any positive @xmath80 there is a natural number @xmath81 such that @xmath82 holds for for @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath55 and @xmath80 are arbitrary we conclude that ( [ blowup_bound ] ) holds for any @xmath1 whenever @xmath84 which establishes the claim of the theorem .      for large values of @xmath3 the picture changes .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath85 , is below unbounded if @xmath86 .",
    "we employ a similar technique , this time looking for an upper estimate to @xmath14 .",
    "we construct it by dirichlet bracketing considering the operators acting as ( [ l_1 ] ) on the annular domains @xmath87 , denoted again as @xmath44 , this time with dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath88 .",
    "we have @xmath89 , hence by minimax principle we have to prove that @xmath90 we estimate @xmath44 from above by an operator with separated variables acting as @xmath91 on @xmath92 functions satisfying @xmath93 for all @xmath94 . the contribution from the radial term",
    "is now nonzero , and moreover , it depends on @xmath50 , however , it is uniformly bounded .",
    "specifically , the spectral threshold of @xmath95 on @xmath96 with dirichlet condition does not exceed @xmath97 , the bound being saturated as @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is sufficient to check that the spectral threshold of the angular part , or of a suitable one - dimensional operator estimating it from above tends to @xmath99 as @xmath42 .",
    "the argument is similar to the one used in the previous proof .",
    "we fix @xmath100 and analyze the operator acting as @xmath101 on @xmath46 with neumann conditions at the endpoints of the interval . using the inequality @xmath102 on @xmath103 $ ] and the unitary equivalence given by the same scaling transformation as in the previous case",
    "we reduce the problem to investigation of the operator @xmath104 where @xmath105 on @xmath70 with neumann conditions at the endpoints . denoting @xmath106",
    "we find in the same way as above that to any @xmath107 there is a natural @xmath81 such that @xmath108 holds for all @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath109 by assumption and @xmath110 are arbitrary , the second inequality yields the desired result .",
    "now we can pass to our main subject which is estimating eigenvalue sums of the operator ( [ operator ] ) for small values of the coupling constant @xmath3 .      to state our result on lower bound on the spectrum",
    "we introduce the following quantity , @xmath111 it is clear from fig .",
