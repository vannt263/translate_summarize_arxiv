    "the correlation induced metal - insulator transition in the half - filled hubbard model is one of the fundamental topics in strongly correlated electron systems.@xcite the hamiltonian of the hubbard model is given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hopping integral between neighboring sites , @xmath0 is the on - site coulomb interaction strength , and @xmath3 is the chemical potential maintaining the average particle density at half filling .",
    "this is achieved by setting @xmath4 due to the presence of the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin direction @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) on the @xmath9-th site and @xmath10 is the number operator .",
    "hereafter we use @xmath11 as the unit of energy .    on the square lattice , assuming the paramagnetic state , the critical coulomb interaction for the metal - insulator transition ( @xmath12 ) is roughly equivalent to the band width , as has been estimated by various numerical methods such as the cluster - extended dynamical mean - field theory ( cdmft ) , @xcite variational cluster approximation ( vca ) , @xcite and variational monte carlo method .",
    "@xcite if the antiferromagnetism ( afm ) is allowed , however , the system immediately goes into the antiferromagnetic insulator state by switching on @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath13 , due to the perfect nesting of the fermi surface with the nesting vector @xmath14 .    on the honeycomb lattice",
    ", situation is different from that of the square lattice .",
    "the tight - binding band dispersion exhibits a semimetallic ( sm ) behavior with the dirac cones at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone ( k and k points ) and vanishing density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the perfect nesting of the fermi surface is absent due to the point - like fermi surface and thus the critical coulomb interactions for the semimetal - insulator transition ( smit ) and afm transition can differ from those of the square lattice .",
    "so far , the quantum phase transitions in the honeycomb lattice have been investigated by various theoretical and numerical studies . a renormalization group analysis in the large-@xmath15 limit",
    ", @xcite where @xmath15 is the number of fermion flavor , predicted that , if the analysis holds in the physical case @xmath16 , the sm - afm transition occurs at a finite @xmath17 value .",
    "the mott transition in a paramagnetic state has been studied by dmft calculations , @xcite where the smit is shown to occur at relatively large interaction strength ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "since the honeycomb lattice is the two - dimensional lattice with the smallest coordination number ( three neighbors ) , spatial correlations neglected in dmft should be taken into account and thus cdmft studies have also been performed . a finite - temperature cdmft with continuous - time quantum monte carlo impurity solver anticipated @xmath19 at zero temperature limit .",
    "@xcite another finite - temperature cdmft with exact - diagonalization solver by liebsch  @xcite showed that the critical interaction is about @xmath20 , but the explicit value of @xmath12 was not found due to the difficulty from limitation of the energy resolution .",
    "recently , he and lu  @xcite showed that the smit occurs at @xmath21 and amf transition is of the first order with the lower and upper critical coulomb interactions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations have also been performed by various authors .",
    "@xcite in particular , the discovery of a spin - liquid phase between @xmath24 and @xmath25 by meng _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite has attracted much attention and stimulated researches on this issue .",
    "recently , however , a large scale qmc up to 2592 sites by sorella _",
    "et al . _ ruled out the existence of the spin liquid state and found a direct sm - afm transition at @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite all in all , critical behaviors near the smit and afm of the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice are rather controversial than those on the square lattice .    in this paper , motivated by such developments in the field ,",
    "we study the afm and smit in the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice by vca with exact - diagonalization solver . @xcite we first calculate the afm order parameter as a function of @xmath0 with various clusters such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 clusters , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number of correlated sites and bath sites , respectively ( see fig.[fig0 ] ) .",
    "then , to study the smit , the single - particle excitation spectra and single - particle gap are calculated as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we thus show that @xmath31 is in fact vanishingly small and therefore the paramagnetic insulating phase appears in a wide interaction strength .",
    "we also calculate the spin correlation functions and find the development of localized moments , whereby the validity of effective spin models is discussed .",
    "we thus show that vca is a suitable method to study the above issues not only because it can take into account the spatial correlations important in low - dimensional systems , but also because it can be performed at zero temperature where the thermal fluctuations are absent and thus it can achieve a high energy - resolution essential for determining the smit .",
    "we employ the vca@xcite to study the smit and afm of the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice at zero temperature . in order to study afm",
    ", we introduce the staggered magnetic field @xmath32 where @xmath33 for @xmath34-sublattice on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "moreover , for the @xmath35 cluster , we introduce the bath hybridization @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin direction @xmath7 on the @xmath9-th bath site and @xmath39 is the hybridization between correlated sites and bath sites .",
    "the bath level is fixed at @xmath40 so as to keep the average particle density of the correlated sites at half filling .",
    "thus the fictitious magnetic field @xmath41 and hybridization strength @xmath39 are the variational parameters .",
    "the eigenvalue problems for the hamiltonian @xmath42 defined on the small clusters are solved and the single - particle green s functions are calculated by the lanczos exact - diagonalization method . then the grand - potential functional @xmath43 is calculated from the green s functions and the stationarity point @xmath44 is searched to find the physical solution .",
    "note that there are other possible variational parameters ; e.g. , enhancement of the hopping integrals between the correlated sites ( @xmath45 ) and the hopping integrals between the bath sites ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "we have checked these variational parameters for some @xmath0 values on the @xmath47 cluster and found that the optimal values are @xmath48 and @xmath49 and the optimal @xmath39 values are affected only by @xmath50 in the presence of these @xmath45 or @xmath46 , and moreover the change in the ground - state energy is negligible . thus we omit the variations with respect to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the similar discussion on the irrelevance of these variational parameters in the variational processes has been made by balzer _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite for the half - filled hubbard model on the square lattice .",

    "filled ( empty ) circles represents the sites on the a ( b)-sublattice of the honeycomb lattice and squares in ( b ) represents the bath sites .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath0 dependence of the staggered magnetization defined as @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the ground - state expectation value calculated by use of the cpt green s function .",
    "@xcite a mean - field - theory ( mft ) result reproduced from ref",
    ".   is also shown .",
    "we fine that @xmath62 strongly depends on the shape of the clusters , i.e. , @xmath63 3.8 , 1.5 , 2.7 , and 3.7 for @xmath64 6 , 8 , 10 , and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the order parameter increases continuously with increasing @xmath0 from @xmath62 , and thus the transition is of the second - order .",
    "the characteristic linear increase of the order parameter @xmath65 near @xmath66 derived by the mft  @xcite is also observed in the vca results .",
    "focusing on the results for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 clusters , we find that the bath degrees of freedom do not much affect the values of both @xmath62 and @xmath69 .",
    "our result @xmath70 obtained for the hexagonal cluster shows a remarkable agreement with the large - scale qmc simulation ( @xmath71 ) @xcite and reasonable agreement with the results of other previous studies .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , @xmath62 calculated for the @xmath72 8 and 10 clusters are lower than that obtained by the mft ( @xmath73 ) . actually , being different from the @xmath74 and @xmath75 clusters",
    ", the hexagonal clusters do not suffer from boundary effects and spatial homogeneity is kept as it should be in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath76 and @xmath77 clusters are the relevant choice of the clusters and hereafter we show the results of this choice .",

    "[ fig1 ] ]      next we calculate the single - particle excitation spectra defined as @xmath78 where a small imaginary part @xmath79 of the complex frequency represents the lorentzian broadening for the spectra .",
    "we use @xmath80 .",
    "the calculated results from @xmath81 to @xmath82 for a paramagnetic state with the @xmath68 cluster are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . at @xmath83 ,",
    "the spectra on the @xmath84-k and @xmath84-m lines become less dispersive , indicating the localized nature of electrons . on the contrary , on the k - m line ( at the edge of the hexagonal brillouin zone ) , the spectra remain to have quasiparticle - like sharp peaks even for @xmath85 . at @xmath86 ,",
    "the upper and lower hubbard bands appear clearly with a large intensity at @xmath87 .",
    "although the single - particle gap exists clearly at @xmath88 , it is hard to judge when the gap opens by increasing @xmath0 due to the artificial lorentzian broadening @xmath79 .",
    "thus we estimate the single - particle gap in a different way discussed in the next subsection .",
    "calculated for a paramagnetic state .",
    "inset : definition of the @xmath84 , m , and k points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]      the single - particle gap is defined as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the upper ( lower ) bound of the chemical potential . since @xmath90 can be evaluated by calculating the particle density by integrating the cpt green s function along the imaginary frequency axis , @xcite @xmath91 does not suffer from the artificial lorentzian broadening .",
    "another way to estimate the single - particle gap is to evaluate the intensity of the self - energy at the fermi level .",
    "the lattice self - energy @xmath92 can be calculated from @xmath93 through the dyson equation .",
    "the intensity of the self - energy at the k point on the fermi level @xmath94 is related to the single - particle gap in the following way .",
    "it is known that the self - energy has only the simple poles on the real frequency axis .",
    "thus , if the single - particle gap exists , the self - energy near the fermi - level has the form @xmath95 .",
    "therefore the lattice green s function at the k point near the fermi level is approximately given as @xmath96 i.e. , the self - energy splits the spectrum above and below the fermi level with the single - particle gap @xmath97     dependence of the single - particle gap @xmath91 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ gap1 ] ) ( triangles ) and eq .",

    "( [ gap1 ] ) and intensity of the self - energy eq .",
    "( [ gap2 ] ) .",
    "although the gap is extremely small ( @xmath98 for @xmath99 ) , the two results nicely coincide .",
    "we thus find that , even at @xmath100 , a small but finite single - particle gap exists .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the single - particle gap opens at infinitesimally small values of @xmath0 , just like in the one - dimensional hubbard model at half filling , i.e. , @xmath101 . to see the effect of bath sites",
    ", we show the results for the @xmath67 and @xmath47 clusters in fig .",
    "[ gapsmallu ] ( b ) . for @xmath102 ,",
    "results for both the afm and paramagnetic states are shown .",
    "we find that the introduction of the bath sites significantly reduces the magnitude of the gap but it can not close the gap , as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ gapsmallu ] ( a ) . for large @xmath0 regime ,",
    "the gap increases linearly with @xmath0 , as it should be in the mott insulator .",
    "figure [ sisj ] shows the @xmath0 dependence of the spin correlation function in the cluster @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the ground state of the @xmath105 cluster with the optimal hybridization @xmath39 and @xmath106 is the spin operator for the correlated site @xmath9 .",
    "positions of @xmath9-th sites are defined in the inset of fig .",
    "calculations are done in the paramagnetic state . for comparison ,",
    "the same quantities for a 6-site heisenberg model with the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction are shown by arrows .",
    "dependence of the spin correlation function of the @xmath47 cluster .",
    "arrows indicate @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( from top to bottom ) for a 6-site heisenberg model with the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction .",
    "inset : definition of the site index @xmath9 . ]",
    "the on - site correlation function @xmath109 represents the development of the local moment .",
    "it increases monotonically and almost linearly with increasing @xmath0 from @xmath110 in the non - interacting limit toward @xmath111 in the localized spin limit . the second- and third - neighbor correlation functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 take small values for @xmath114",
    "this indicates that , although the single - particle gap is finite , electrons still keep their itinerancy and spin correlations beyond the neighboring sites are not developed , unlike in the heisenberg model .",
    "thus , to investigate the spin - liquid nature from an effective spin model , the heisenberg model with high @xmath115-order exchange interactions should be necessary .",
    "antiferromagnetic correlations between the neighboring sites @xmath116 , as well as @xmath112 and @xmath113 , start increasing from @xmath117 , where the electrons begin to localize and local moments are developed .",
    "this is consistent with the emergence of the afm at @xmath70 and the spectral signature of electron localization ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in this interaction regime ,",
    "the heisenberg model with the nearest - neighbor exchange interaction may be appropriate for an effective low - energy model of the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we have studied the semimetal - insulator transition ( smit ) and antiferromagnetism ( afm ) in the half - filled hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice within the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) .",
    "the afm transition was found to be of the second order and the critical coulomb interaction for the afm ( @xmath62 ) obtained in the hexagonal clusters showed a remarkable agreement with the recent large - scale quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "@xcite the single - particle gap has been calculated down to @xmath100 and found to be finite .",
    "thus we concluded that the critical coulomb interaction for the smit is @xmath21 .",
    "the extremely small gap obtained by our zero - temperature calculations in the small @xmath0 regime suggests that the careful evaluation of the single - particle gap is required for the smit on the honeycomb lattice . in the paramagnetic insulating state , we have calculated the spin - correlation functions and found that the local moments are not developed .",
