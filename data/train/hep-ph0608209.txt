    "in the paper @xcite , considering the very high energy electron - nucleon scattering with peripheral production of a hadronic state @xmath0 moving closely to a direction of initial nucleon and utilizing analytic properties of the forward compton scattering amplitudes on the nucleons , the new sum rule , relating proton dirac radius and anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron to the convergent integral of the difference of total proton and neutron photoproduction cross - sections , was derived . in this paper",
    "we extend the previous method deriving sum rules for various suitable couples of the members of the pseudoscalar meson nonet , giving into a relation mean squared charge radii with the convergent integral of the difference of total hadron photoproduction cross - sections on the considered pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "let us consider a very high energy peripheral electroproduction process on pseudoscalar mesons @xmath1 @xmath2 where the produced pure hadronic state @xmath0 is moving closely to the direction of the initial meson .",
    "its matrix element in the one photon exchange approximation takes the form @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "now , by means of the method of equivalent photons @xcite , examining the pseudoscalar meson in the rest , the electron energy to be very high and the small photon momentum transfer , one can express the differential cross - sections of the processes ( [ a1 ] ) as a function of @xmath5 through integral over the total hadron photoproduction cross - sections on pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "really , applying to ( [ a2 ] ) the sudakov expansion @xcite of the photon transferred four - vector @xmath6 @xmath7 into the almost light - like vectors    @xmath8    then using the gribov prescription @xcite for the numerator of the photon green function    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , as a consequence of the electron energy in ( [ a1 ] ) to be very high and the photon momentum transfer squared @xmath11 to be small one , one obtaines for the corresponding cross - section @xmath12 with a summation through the created hadronic states @xmath0 .",

    "now , let us investigate analytic properties of the forward compton scattering amplitude @xmath34 in @xmath24-plane .",
    "they consist in meson intermediate state pole at @xmath35 , the right - hand cut starting at the three meson threshold and the @xmath36-channel left - hand cut . defining the path integral @xmath37 ( for more detail see @xcite ) in @xmath24 plane @xmath38 from the gauge invariant light - cone projection @xmath39 of the part @xmath40 of the total compton scattering tensor with photon first absorbed and then emitted along the meson world line as presented in fig.1a and once closing the contour @xmath41 to upper half - plane , another one to lower half - plane ( see figs .",
    "1b ) , the following sum rule @xmath42 \\label{a14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] appears with @xmath43 to be the residuum of the meson intermediate state pole contribution expressed through the pseudoscalar meson charge form factor @xmath44 and the left - hand cut contributions expressed by an integral of the difference @xmath45 $ ] are mutually annulated . then , substituting ( [ a15 ] ) into ( [ a14 ] ) and taking into account ( [ a11 ] ) with @xmath46 , one comes to the meson sum rules @xmath47 - [ f^2_p({\\bf{-q^2}})-f^2_p(0 ) ] = \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{2}{\\pi \\alpha^2}({\\bf{q^2}})^2\\big(\\frac{d\\sigma^{e^-",
    "p\\to e^-x}}{d{\\bf{q}}^2 } - \\frac{d\\sigma^{e^- p'\\to e^-x'}}{d{\\bf{q}}^2}\\big)\\label{a16},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the left - hand side was renormalized in order to separate the pure strong interactions from electromagnetic ones . moreover ,",
    "substituting here for small values of @xmath5 the relation ( [ a12 ] ) and using the laboratory coordinate system by @xmath48 and finally taking a derivative according to @xmath49 of both sides for @xmath50 , one comes to the new sum rule relating meson mean squared charge radii to the convergent integral of the difference of corresponding total hadron photoproduction cross - sections on mesons    @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which just a mutual cancelation of the rise of the latter cross sections for @xmath52 is achieved .",
    "according to the su(3 ) classification of existing hadrons there are the following members of the ground state pseudoscalar meson nonet @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "however , in consequence of cpt invariance the meson electromagnetic form factors @xmath62 hold the following relation @xmath63 where @xmath64 means antiparticle .    since @xmath65 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are true neutral particles , their electromagnetic form factors are owing to the ( [ a18 ] ) zero in the whole region of a definition and therefore we exclude them from further considerations .",
    "if one considers couples of particle - antiparticle like @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath58 , @xmath57 , the left hand side of ( [ a16 ] ) is owing to the relation ( [ a18 ] ) equal zero and we exclude couples @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath58 , @xmath57 from further considerations as well .",
    "if one considers a couple of the isodoublet of kaons @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the following cabibbo - radicati @xcite like sum rules for kaons can be written @xmath70\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath71\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in which the relation @xmath72 for kaon mean squared charge radii , following directly from ( [ a18 ] ) , holds and divergence of the integrals , due to an increase of the total cross - sections @xmath73 for large values of @xmath74 , is taken off by the increase of total cross - sections @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "if besides the latter , also the relations @xmath77 following from @xmath41 invariance of the electromagnetic interactions , are taken into account , one can see the sum rule ( [ a20 ] ) , as well as all other possible sum rules obtained by combinations @xmath78 to be contained already in ( [ a19 ] ) .",
    "the last possibility is a consideration of a couple of mesons taken from the isomultiplet of pions and the isomultiplet of kaons leading to the following less precise ( in comparison with ( [ a19 ] ) ) sum rules @xmath79=\\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\int_{\\omega_{th}}^{\\infty } \\frac{d\\omega } { \\omega}\\left[\\sigma_{tot}^{\\gamma \\pi^{\\pm}\\to x}(\\omega)- \\sigma_{tot}^{\\gamma k^{\\pm}\\to x}(\\omega)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath80,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as there is no complete annulation of the left - hand cut contributions in ( [ a14 ] ) due to a larger difference in the masses of joining pairs of particles .",
    "the latter assertion can be roughly confirmed as follows .",
    "the left - hand cut contribution in ( [ a14 ] ) has no direct interpretation in terms of a cross - section .",
    "nevertheless , it can be associated ( for more detail see ref .",
    "@xcite ) with contribution to the cross - sections of @xmath81 meson pair electroproduction on considered target meson @xmath82 , arising from taking into account the identity of final state mesons .",
    "then the left - hand cut contribution to the derivative according to @xmath83 at @xmath84 of scattering amplitudes entering sum rules have an order of magnitude    @xmath85\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 is the strong coupling constant of the @xmath87-meson to the considered meson and @xmath88 is the mass of the target meson . taking the pdg @xcite typical value for the total cross - section of scattering of a pion on proton to be @xmath89 $ ] , then @xmath87-meson @xmath90-channel contribution and @xmath91 in the case of the target meson is charged pion and @xmath92 in the case of the target meson is kaon , we have @xmath93 $ ] and @xmath94 $ ] respectively , which confirm above mentioned statement .    now taking the experimental values @xcite",
    "+ @xmath95 $ ] + and + @xmath96 $ ] + one comes to the conclusion that in average @xmath97 > 0\\\\ \\nonumber [ \\sigma_{tot}^{\\gamma k^-\\to x}(\\omega)- \\sigma_{tot}^{\\gamma \\bar k^0\\to x}(\\omega ) ] > 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from where the following inequalities for finite values of @xmath74 in average follow @xmath98    subtracting up ( [ a19 ] ) or ( [ a20 ] ) from the relation ( [ a23 ] ) the sum rule ( [ a22 ] ) is obtained , what demonstrates a mutual consistency of all considered sum rules .",
    "they have been derived in analogy with a derivation @xcite of the sum rule for a difference of proton and neutron total photoproduction cross - sections , which are fulfilled with a very high precision .",
    "therefore we believe that also the sum rules for total cross - sections of hadron photoproduction on pseudoscalar mesons presented in this paper are correct .",
    "however , the final word is always given by experimental tests .",
    "the experimental test of the derived sum rules can be practically carried out if there are known the total hadron photoproduction cross - sections on pions and kaons as a function of energy , which , however , are missing till now .",
    "nevertheless , the idea of a conversion of the electron beams of linear @xmath99 colliders into photon beams , using the process of the backward compton scattering of laser light off the high energy electrons , which is known @xcite already for few decades , together with a real possibility of a production of enough intensive beams of pions @xcite provide a real chance for measurements of the total hadron photoproduction cross - sections on charged pions and kaons , and as a result also the experimental test of the sum rules derived in this paper .",
    "considering the very high energy peripheral electron pseudoscalar meson scattering with a production of a hadronic state @xmath0 moving closely to the direction of initial meson , then utilizing analytic properties of the forward compton scattering amplitude on the same meson , for the case of small transferred momenta new cabibbo - radicati @xcite like sum rules , relating the corresponding meson mean squared charge radii with the convergent integral over a difference of the total hadron photoproduction cross - sections on mesons are derived . unlike the sum rules ( [ a19 ] ) , ( [ a20 ] ) , ( [ a22 ] ) and ( [ a23 ] ) , derived in this paper , there could be difficulties with experimental verification of the cabibbo - radicati sum rule due to appearance of the sum of total photoproduction cross - sections on pions with the transition always to a hadronic state with a specific isospin state and moreover , the convergence of the corresponding integral is questionable .",
