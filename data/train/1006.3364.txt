    "the emerging field of transformation optics , where useful arrangements of man - made `` metamaterials '' @xcite are designed via transformations of electromagnetic fields , has theoretical roots stretching back nearly a century , to the early days of general relativity .",
    "the idea that the behavior of light in a gravitational field can be replicated by a suitable distribution of refractive media appears to have been first postulated by eddington @xcite .",
    "subsequently , gordon @xcite studied the inverse problem , that of representing a refractive medium as a vacuum space - time described by an `` optical metric '' .",
    "later , plebanski @xcite found effective constitutive relations for electromagnetic waves propagating in vacuum space - times , but , while recognizing the formal equivalence of these equations to those in a macroscopic medium in flat space - time , does not exploit this equivalence to actually describe such a medium .",
    "this was first done by de felice @xcite , who used the plebanski equations to describe the equivalent medium of both a spherically symmetric gravitational system and friedmann - robertson - walker space - time .",
    "more recently , pendry @xcite , pointed out the specific relationship between spatial transformations and material properties , and demonstrated how it could be used to create novel devices . closely related work by greenleaf et al .",
    "@xcite developed a similar concept for electric current flow and applied it to impedance tomography .",
    "the initial approaches to transformation optics relied on purely spatial transformations @xcite .",
    "leonhardt and philbin generalized this to transformations involving both space and time by using the explicit equivalence given by de felice ; thus linking transformation optics to differential geometry @xcite .",
    "another approach @xcite , based on field - transforming metamaterials , considers more general transformations in the fourier domain , but at the expense of the intuitive and appealing geometric interpretation . for more recent reviews",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .    in examining the details of the plebanski - de felice approach ,",
    "we find some limitations that are addressed here . as pointed out by plebanski himself @xcite , the equation now bearing his name",
    "is not strictly covariant , because its derivation requires a matrix inversion that is not a true tensor operation .",
    "one consequence of this , in the context of transformation optics , is that magneto - electric coupling terms can not always be simply interpreted as a material velocity , as is frequently done .",
    "this is because the plebanski equations can only be identified with stationary media or with slowly moving ( i.e.  nonrelativistic ) , _ isotropic _ media @xcite .",
    "this prompts the question of whether the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite may be generalized to clearly distinguish magneto - electric couplings from material velocity , and allow for specially relativistic corrections .",
    "just such an approach was outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was demonstrated to to recover several results obtained through other means .    here we provide a complete derivation of the approach outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , further generalizing the result obtained there . a physically realistic scenario for transformation optics designed devices",
    "is that the device move with arbitrary velocity .",
    "we demonstrate that the approach described here may be applied to find the material properties of a transformation when the resultant material is constrained to move with arbitrary uniform velocity with respect to the frame in which the transformations are given .",
    "this represents a departure from most previous examples in transformation optics , where either the resulting material is stationary or where the velocity is dictated by the transformation itself .",
    "while a few examples exist of nonrelativistic moving dielectrics in transformation optics for special cases @xcite , we provide a systematic approach that is widely applicable for any velocity .",
    "another limitation of the plebanski - de felice approach is that the resulting material must reside in vacuum , minkowski space - time .",
    "the approach described here relaxes these conditions , allowing for physically realistic scenarios such as transformations in arbitrary non - vacuum initial dielectric media @xcite , or in arbitrary space - times  thus providing general relativistic corrections for transformations in arbitrary space - times , such as the weakly curved space - time near earth @xcite .",
    "lastly , we show that this covariant approach is consistent with , and generalizes , gordon s optical metric as essentially the inverse problem of transformation optics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .  [",

    "the basic elements of covariant electrodynamics needed for transformation optics were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we present a relatively self - contained and more detailed description of covariant electrodynamics in both vacuum and linear materials .",
    "this development relies on the geometric language and tools of differential geometry , such as _ exterior derivative _ , _ wedge product _ , and the _ pullback _ of a tensor .",
    "these aspects of differential geometry are described in a myriad of excellent sources , such as @xcite .",
    "the most important of these for our purpose , the pullback map , is described in appendix [ sec : geometry ] .",

    "@xmath8 is the curvature 2-form of the @xmath4 fiber bundle , equal to the exterior derivative of @xmath7 , @xmath9 where the comma indicates a derivative .",

    "the spatial components of @xmath18 are @xmath19 , while the time component is the change in energy per unit time , or the power .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 fields are now tightly intertwined , simply representing different components of a single object , @xmath10 . because the second exterior derivative of any form vanishes and the fact that @xmath22 , it immediately follows that @xmath23 this is nothing more than the covariant form of the homogeneous maxwell equations , and shows that the homogeneous equations are simply geometric conditions imposed on the fields .",
    "naturally associated to each point of the space - time manifold are four @xmath24-dimensional vector spaces , where @xmath25 .",

    "the composition of maps , called the hodge dual , makes the diagram of figure 1 commutative .",
    "the hodge dual provides a natural two - form dual to the field strength @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , we define the map @xmath34 as the composition @xmath35 applied to 2-forms ( where @xmath36 is the space of 2-forms ) , or in component form @xmath37 the components of @xmath38 can also be represented as a matrix , that in a local orthonormal frame ( or minkowski space - time with cartesian coordinates ) have values @xmath39 the dual nature is now explicit ; where we had the decomposition @xmath40 we now have the dual decomposition @xmath41 .     between @xmath42 and @xmath43 alternating tensors , while the volume form @xmath30 provides a bijection between @xmath42 and @xmath44 alternating tensors ( for any @xmath45 ) .",

    "differential geometry tells us that we can only integrate a @xmath27-form over a @xmath27-dimensional ( sub)manifold .",
    "there are 3 ways to construct a 4-form from @xmath10 and @xmath49 that can be integrated over the 4-dimensional space - time manifold : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ( we neglect a possibility such as @xmath53 , which results in a massive photon described by the proca equations @xcite ) .",
    "consider the first possibility . since @xmath54 , @xmath55 essentially , this term is a total 4-divergence and contributes nothing to the integral .",
    "writing out the wedge product shows that @xmath56 , so the second possibility also contributes nothing to the integral .",
    "the last possibility , however , gives a contribution @xmath57 the component form of this expression  the right hand side of eq .",

    "excitation tensor_. the components of @xmath60 can be represented as a matrix , that in a local orthonormal frame ( or minkowski space - time with cartesian coordinates ) have values @xmath61 then the identification @xmath62 is a linear map that takes @xmath59 to @xmath60 and provides a set of constitutive relations for the components of @xmath60 in terms of those of @xmath10 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcomponents ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fcomponents ] ) , it is clear that @xmath63 reduces to the trivial , vacuum , constitutive relations @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 when @xmath67 ) .",
    "thus we find that a trivial linear map recovers the correct constitutive relations in vacuum , but this will be extended to something non - trivial in the next section .",
    "we would like to stress that we take @xmath60 to be a tensor , not a tensor density .",
    "expressing the excitation as a tensor density is common in the literature , but using @xmath63 makes use of the metric structure and explicitly shows the space - time contributions encoded by @xmath68 , which will be very useful when discussing materials and , in particular , transformation optics .",

    "the 3-form @xmath73 may be integrated over a three dimensional hypersurface of the space - time manifold . choosing a constant - time hypersurface is equivalent to a spatial 3-volume .",
    "integrating @xmath73 over this spatial 3-volume gives the charge enclosed .",
    "integrating @xmath73 over a 1 + 2 hypersurface corresponding to time and a spatial 2-surface gives the current flowing through the spatial surface .",

    "( [ eq : inhomogeneousmaxwell ] ) .",
    "electrodynamics in materials is somewhat more complicated than electrodynamics in vacuum . here",
    "we expand on the brief introduction given in ref .",
    "@xcite , whose main points are embedded here for a complete and self - contained discussion .",
    "the microscopic theory of electrodynamics would be a quantum field theory described by some complicated action that includes not only the electromagnetic fields , but also the various matter fields making up the material , along with their interactions and associated gauge fields @xcite .",
    "considering the vast number of fields contained in a sample of ordinary material , it would be an impossible task to examine the full exact theory .",
    "fortunately , in the thermodynamic limit , electrodynamics in media can be described by an effective theory .",
    "this generally comes in the form of a material dependent set of constitutive relations .    the standard vector relations @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 and @xmath83 may be matrix - valued ) are frequently combined into an expression such as @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "such an expression can be useful , particularly when exploring electrodynamics in the absence of a metric @xcite .",
    "however , since we assume the existence of a metric , we instead choose to retain the usual space - time notions of metric and hodge dual @xmath68 , and take the minimal approach of extending the trivial constitutive equation @xmath63 in vacuum to a more general linear constitutive equation @xcite @xmath85 that in component form reads @xmath86 the tensor @xmath87 contains information on the dielectric material s properties , and can be thought of as representing an averaging over all the material contributions to an action that describes a more fundamental quantum field theory .",
    "the motivation for using this constitutive relation is to explicitly separate the space - time effects ( i.e.  the plebanski relations ) from the material effects , which will be useful for transformation optics .    to retain the symmetry properties and usual notions of @xmath60 and @xmath10",
    ", @xmath88 must be independently antisymmetric on its first two and last two indices , and in vacuum @xmath89 .",
    "thus the classical vacuum is a perfect dielectric for which a trivial @xmath88 describes the electrodynamics , and we extend this idea to a non - trivial @xmath88 describing electrodynamics in arbitrary , linear , dielectric media .",
    "these conditions reduce the number of free parameters of @xmath88 to 36",
    ". one may further decompose @xmath88 into principle , skewon , and axion parts @xcite , but we do not consider this here .",
    "additional symmetry conditions may be imposed based on thermodynamic or energy conservation arguments , or by the lack of an observed directive effect in naturally occurring stationary materials @xcite .",
    "having recently entered an era of engineered materials which may incorporate active elements @xcite , however , we leave open the discussion of additional symmetries and consider the three conditions above to be the minimal requirements .",
    "the condition @xmath90 is sufficient to uniquely specify all components of @xmath88 for the vacuum , they are @xcite @xmath91    equation ( [ eq : vacchi ] ) expresses @xmath88 as a matrix of matrices , the first two indices of @xmath92 give the @xmath93 component of the large matrix , which is itself a matrix described by the second set of indices .",
    "the component values of @xmath88 _ for the vacuum _ are unique and independent of coordinate system . for a more general material , the component values can easily be determined by simply matching the results of the constitutive equation @xmath94 with the usual flat - space constitutive relations in a particular coordinate system , as shown in appendix [ sec : cartesiancoords ] .",
    "the components of the constitutive equation provide a set of six independent equations that can locally be collected in the form @xmath95 where we use the notation @xmath96 to denote a @xmath97 matrix . rearranging these",
    "to @xmath98 gives the more familiar representation for the constitutive relations .",
    "these three - dimensional representations of the completely covariant eq .",
    "( [ eq : constitutive ] ) are essentially equivalent , and it is a simple matter to switch between them using @xmath99 one should be aware that these @xmath97 matrices are not tensors , but simply components of @xmath88 that have been collected into matrices .",
    "they could be made into tensors by incorporating the appropriate 3-dimensional hodge dual of a space - like hypersurface .",
    "as they stand , eqs .  ( [ eq : constitutivecomponents1 ] ) and ( [ eq : constitutivecomponents2 ] ) are somewhat misleading , because while @xmath100 and @xmath101 are components of a 1-form , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are really selected components of the 2-forms @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "thus a more appropriate version of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : constitutivecomponents2 ] ) would be something like    [ eq : constitutivecomponents3 ] @xmath106 @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the hodge dual on the 3-dimensional space - like hypersurface .",
    "but this requires that we resolve the space - time into space and time components , selecting an observer to define a direction of time .",
    "the spatial hypersurface is then orthogonal to the selected direction of time . transforming to the local frame of the selected observer we can make the identifications of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cartesianchi ] ) and then give the constitutive equations a 3-dimensional representation .",
    "however , this requires greater care , and the inclusion of time transformations is not immediately evident",
    ". we will therefore continue with a manifestly 4-dimensional approach .",
    "the completely covariant approach to transformation optics was outlined in @xcite , here we derive this method in greater detail . start with an initial space - time @xmath5 and field configuration @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the usual approach to transformation optics begins by imagining a coordinate transformation @xmath112 that in some way `` deforms '' the manifold .",
    "for example , in the case of an electromagnetic cloak @xcite , we imagine a coordinate transformation that stretches out a hole in minkowski space - time ( with a point removed ) .",
    "however , certain subtleties involved in this picture should be clarified .",
    "the idea of stretching open a hole or otherwise deforming the space - time is non - physical ; therefore it is more appropriate to imagine a map which takes @xmath5 to an image @xmath113 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] .",
    "while it may be intuitive to think of the map @xmath112 as given , the transformation of 2-forms ( representing the fields of interest ) requires instead a map @xmath114 that describes how the image @xmath115 is mapped to the original manifold . in certain situations it may be possible to set @xmath116 , but in general @xmath117 may not even exist .",
    "furthermore , while the transformation @xmath114 acts to transform the fields , the space - time metric is transformed by a different map @xmath118 , which here we take to be the identity .",
    "we will have more to say about this below .    to make this more concrete ,",
    "consider a pair of maps @xmath119 .",
    "we demand that @xmath118 acts only on the metric via its pullback @xmath120 on the other hand , we demand that the map @xmath114 acts on the electromagnetic fields via its pullback @xmath121 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] . under @xmath119 ,",
    "the metric and fields are transformed from the configuration @xmath109 , where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath94 to a new configuration @xmath122 , where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 .    the way to physically achieve such",
    "a transformation is to introduce some kind of material , just like introducing a dielectric between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor .",

    "but from the constitutive relation @xmath127 we also have @xmath130 the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tildegleft ] ) and ( [ eq : tildegright ] ) must be equal , but to clearly see what is going on we must consider the action of @xmath131 on a bi - vector @xmath132 , so @xmath133\\left(\\mathbf{v}_x\\right).\\ ] ] letting @xmath134 be the jacobian matrix of @xmath114 ( @xmath134 is the matrix representation of @xmath135 ) this may be written in component form as @xmath136 where we have indicated explicitly where each tensor or jacobian matrix is evaluated .",

    "the answer is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : materialchi ] ) .",
    "a few remarks are in order concerning eq .",
    "( [ eq : materialchi ] ) . for applications in transformation optics",
    ", @xmath118 is generally taken to be the identity map , meaning that @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "however , this is not strictly necessary , and allowing @xmath118 to be a more general map may be useful in the study of analog space - times @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if in addition to @xmath118 being the identity the initial space - time is vacuum , then since @xmath152 , @xmath153 where the first @xmath68 is evaluated at @xmath148 and everything else is evaluated at @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "notice that the prescriptions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : materialchi ] ) or ( [ eq : initialvacmaterialchi ] ) are meaningful only for points @xmath154 .",
    "so for transformations such as the electromagnetic cloak , where there is a hole in @xmath115 , the material parameters inside the hole are unspecified and completely arbitrary . in this way , any uncharged material may be hidden inside the cloak without affecting the behavior of the fields outside the cloak .",
    "one might be concerned by the step of assigning two different transformations , one to the metric and one to the fields , and argue that such a step is not allowed because it does not constitute a symmetry of the system . however ,",
    "these are not maps between physically equivalent systems , clearly evidenced by the fact that one is vacuum and the other contains a material .",
    "thus there is no symmetry that should be preserved .",
    "the point of transformation optics is that the transformed fields do not constitute a solution to maxwell s equations in the original space - time but do constitute a solution to maxwell s equations in the appropriate material .",
    "thus the mappings involved are not mappings between equivalent solutions , but rather a method of generating new solutions from the original ( untransformed ) solution .",
    "furthermore , one might be concerned that the pullback of the fields under @xmath114 might not be contained in the image of the pullback of the metric under @xmath118 .",
    "ultimately , this map may only be defined locally .",
    "but since the final material parameters must ultimately be measured by a local observer with a local metric , the depiction in fig .  [",
    "fig : maps ] can always be defined locally ( neglecting irrelevant situations like transformation optics near singularities ) .",
    "finally , we note that because of the symmetries of @xmath10 and @xmath60 , which have only 6 independent components each , and of @xmath88 and @xmath68 , which have at most 36 independent components , we could re - express these results in terms of two 6-dimensional vectors encoding the information of @xmath10 and @xmath60 and two @xmath155 matrices encoding the information of @xmath88 and @xmath68 . this 6-dimensional representation",
    "is commonly encountered in the literature , and could be advantageous if performing calculations by hand because of the large number of terms that must be computed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : materialchi ] ) .",
    "however , a modern computer algebra package can handle the full calculation with ease , and the manifestly 4-dimensional nature of the expressions is useful when further manipulations are performed .",
    "the completely covariant approach to transformation optics developed above provides a concrete and powerful framework for analyzing any desired configuration of fields and linear dielectric materials in any space - time and with any relative velocities .",
    "several previous examples have been given @xcite which demonstrate that the results obtained with the completely covariant approach agree with results obtained through other means .",
    "this section presents some additional examples to illustrate the applicability of the completely covariant approach to arbitrary dielectric velocities .",
