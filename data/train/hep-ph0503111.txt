    "top - condensation models @xcite are interesting candidates for a realistic theory of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "they are a particular case of models of dynamical ewsb @xcite , where the electroweak ( ew ) gauge symmetry is broken due to the condensation of fermion - antifermion bilinears . in top - condensation models",
    "the condensates are made of known fermions , mainly of the top quark . in the minimal models",
    "no new particles are postulated .",
    "the fundamental degrees of freedom are only fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "no fundamental scalar fields such as the standard model ( sm ) higgs field are present . on the other hand the spectrum of the theory includes one or more composite higgs particles .",
    "they are fermion - antifermion bound states and play a similar role as the fundamental higgs particles in the sm and its extensions .    besides the well - established @xmath2 gauge interactions a new four - fermion interaction is postulated .",
    "it provides the dynamics responsible of ewsb and the generation of sm fermion masses at the same time . note that in general two different sectors are necessary for these purposes . in technicolor , for example , technicolor gauge interactions trigger ewsb while extended technicolor interactions are required to generate fermion masses . due to the non - perturbative nature of the new interaction some approximation",
    "is needed .",
    "calculations at first order in the @xmath3 expansion , where @xmath4 is the number of colors are often made , obtaining a version of the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "next - to - leading order calculation are also available @xcite .",
    "the four - fermion term postulated in top - condensation models is generally seen as an effective interaction . at some high energy scale",
    "@xmath5 an asymptotically free gauge interaction becomes strongly - coupled . for energies below @xmath5 the new interaction",
    "is effectively described by operators constructed with the fields corresponding to the light ( @xmath6 ) degrees of freedom of the theory . at low energies",
    "the most important non - renormalizable operators are the ones having the lowest mass dimension .",
    "therefore dimension - six four - fermion operators are considered .",
    "normally only four - fermion operators made of ( pseudo)scalar fermion bilinears are taken into account .",
    "they are the ones leading to ( pseudo)scalar composite fields .",
    "axial vector and vector fermion bilinears are ignored .",
    "note , however , that the distinction between ( pseudo)scalar and ( axial)vector bilinears is ambiguous due to fierz identities .",
    "the new interaction must violate the flavor symmetry , i.e. must be non - universal , in order to generate the observed fermion mass pattern .",
    "topcolor models @xcite are examples of a theory of this type . in a second scenario the four - fermion interaction term acquires a more fundamental status .",
    "it is assumed that the sm with the higgs sector being replaced by a general dimension - six four - fermion interaction is a ( non - perturbatively ) renormalizable theory @xcite .",
    "this is the case if one or more non - gaussian ultraviolet stable fixed points are established beyond the point - like approximation @xcite .",
    "in this note the four - fermion interaction term is used as a starting point .",
    "therefore , besides the four - fermion and the sm gauge couplings , the scale @xmath5 at which the whole lagrangian is defined , is also a parameter of the theory .    for @xmath5",
    "much bigger than the electroweak scale , complementary to the njl approach a perturbative renormalization group analysis can be made @xcite .",
    "expansion is difficult to justify @xcite . ]",
    "this method , which incorporates the sm gauge interactions , provides reliable values for the top - quark and higgs - boson masses . in this approach",
    "the information that composite higgs doublets appear at the scale @xmath5 is encoded in the compositeness condition .",
    "to have a very high scale @xmath5 is , however , not very attractive because the theory suffers from fine - tuning in exactly the same way as the sm .",
    "another important point is the one related to the distinction between fundamental and composite higgs particles .",
    "if the compositeness scale @xmath5 is very high , the composite nature of these particles can not be directly verified by experiments in the near future .",
    "a more interesting possibility is to have a scale @xmath5 not very much higher than the ew scale , @xmath7 . in this case",
    "no fine - tuning problem appears . besides",
    ", the generation of the scale @xmath5 could be explained from dimensional transmutation .",
    "this would solve or avoid the hierarchy problem .",
    "a perturbative renormalization group analysis can not be justified in this case .",
    "topcolor assisted technicolor @xcite , and top - quark see - saw @xcite are examples of theories of this type . in these theories the njl approach",
    "is widely used .    in this paper",
    ", we present a top - condensation model in which together with the ew symmetry the discrete @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "a @xmath0-conserving four - fermion interaction term including the three quark generations is considered . under certain conditions",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken and the @xmath0-violating phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is generated . besides , realistic mixing angles and quark masses are obtained .",
    "leading order approximation in the @xmath3 expansion is adopted .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the model is presented in @xcite .    the first model with spontaneous @xmath0 violation was considered by t.  d.  lee in 1973 @xcite , the same year that m.  kobayashi and t.  maskawa published their important paper @xcite . in the lee model ( or its generalization for the case of 3 quark families ) two fundamental higgs fields are considered . for certain values of the parameters of the model the @xmath0-symmetric",
    "effective potential has a @xmath0-non - symmetric minimum . as a result",
    "the model has a number of @xmath0-violating interactions , namely @xmath8 boson exchange ( as in the sm ) , charged and ( flavor violating and flavor conserving ) neutral higgs boson exchange . flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) are present in this model already at tree level .",
    "this requires a mechanism for their suppression in order to avoid conflict with experimental data .",
    "there are two potential problems in models of spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking at the ew scale .",
    "the first is the one related with fcncs .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the requirements of spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking at the ew scale , absence of fcncs at tree level , and a realistic ckm matrix can not be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "therefore , models presenting spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking at the ew scale have tree - level non - diagonal yukawa coupling matrices . in order to have a realistic model a suppression mechanism is needed .",
    "the second potential problem is a domain wall problem which arises in a cosmological context .",
    "the effective potential has in general degenerate minima corresponding to complex conjugate vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . at the ew phase transition domains with different signs of the vev phases",
    "are formed .",
    "these domains are separated by walls with energy density much bigger than the closure energy of the universe ( after taking into account the effect of the universe expansion ) @xcite .",
    "if one considers this problem to be a serious one , some solution must be found in order that spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking at the ew scale is viable .",
