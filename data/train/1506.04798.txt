    "spintronics is one of the most growing research fields in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "recently , the rashba - type spin splitting  @xcite , where the spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) lifts the spin degeneracy in the inversion - symmetry broken environments such as surfaces of solids or interfaces of heterostructures , has drawn much attention because of the possibility of coherent spin manipulation without external magnetic field .",
    "after the first observation of such spin - split bands at the au(111 ) surface  @xcite , a number of experimental and theoretical studies have intensively examined the rashba - type spin splitting at various heavy - metal surfaces  @xcite , heavy - metal overlayers on surfaces  @xcite , and semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite . especially , the search for one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin - polarized electronic systems is desirable for manipulating spin carriers  @xcite . in this regard , 1d nanowires formed on si surfaces such as au chains on stepped si surfaces  @xcite , pt nanowires on si(110 )  @xcite , and pb atom wires on si(557 )  @xcite have been investigated to show a relatively larger rashba - type spin splitting compared to two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems .",
    "although the rashba - bychkov model  @xcite has been remarkably successful in explaining the phenomena of the rashba spin splitting in terms of the effective magnetic filed experienced by electrons moving in the potential gradient perpendicular to the surface , it significantly underestimates the spin splitting as an energy scale of @xmath310@xmath4 ev which is about 10@xmath5 times smaller  @xcite than experimental measurements  @xcite . in order to estimate quantitatively the size of the rashba - type spin splitting",
    ", several recent studies have taken into account other factors missed in the rashba - bychkov model , such as the atomic soc effect  @xcite , the in - plane anisotropy of surface potential  @xcite , the asymmetry of surface charge distribution  @xcite , and the presence of orbital angular momentum at surfaces  @xcite . since such various contributions to the rashba - type spin",
    "splitting can be enhanced in 1d electron systems compared to 2d electron systems  @xcite , it is interesting and challenging to search for the 1d electron system with a giant rashba - type spin splitting . here , by choosing a prototypical 1d electron system formed on a heterogeneous semiconductor substrate , we propose an ideal platform for exploration of the giant spin splitting .     and",

    "two bi atoms bonding to ga and as atoms are labeled as bi@xmath8 and bi@xmath9 , respectively.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in this paper , we present a density - functional theory ( dft ) study of the giant spin splitting in self - assembled bi zigzag chains on gaas(110 ) .",
    "this zigzag chain is composed of two geometrically and electronically inequivalent bi atoms bonding to ga and as atoms ( see fig .",
    "1 )  @xcite , forming an interface at which the broken inversion symmetry produces the large potential gradients perpendicular and parallel to the surface .",
    "we find that the soc enhances the hybridization of the bi @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 orbitals as well as ga and as @xmath10 orbitals , giving rise to the asymmetry of surface charge distribution around the bi atoms and the ga and as substrate atoms up to the third deeper substrate layer .",
    "this significant asymmetric surface charge distribution together with the out - of - plane and in - plane surface electric fields increases the magnitudes of soc and electric dipole interaction , leading to a giant spin splitting with the in - plane and out - of - plane spin components",
    ". the present findings will provide important implications for understanding the underlying driving forces behind the possible giant spin splitting in 1d nanowires formed on heterogeneous semiconductor substrates .",
    "the present dft calculations were performed using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package with the projector - augmented wave method and a plane wave basis set  @xcite . for the treatment of exchange - correlation energy , we employed the generalized - gradient approximation functional of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite .",
    "the bi / gaas(110 ) substrate was modeled by a periodic slab geometry consisting of the seven ga and as atomic layers with @xmath328  of vacuum in between the slabs .",
    "the bottom of the gaas substrate was passivated by pseudohydrogen atoms  @xcite with 0.75 or 1.25 @xmath11 .",
    "we employed a dipole correction that cancels the artificial electric field across the slab  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12-space integration was done with the 24@xmath1336 monkhorst - pack meshes in the surface brillouin zones ( sbz ) of the @xmath14 unit cell .",
    "all atoms except the bottom two substrate layers were allowed to relax along the calculated forces until all the residual force components were less than 0.02 ev /  .",
    "we begin to optimize the atomic structure of the bi / gaas(110 ) surface using dft calculation within the generalized gradient approximation of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) in the absence of soc .",
    "the optimized structure is displayed in fig .",
    "1 . the calculated bond lengths at the interface are @xmath15 = 3.00  , @xmath16 = 2.77  , and @xmath17 = 2.77  , in good agreement with previous theoretical  @xcite and experimental data  @xcite ( see table is of the supplemental material  @xcite ) .",
    "it is noticeable that two bi atoms bonding to ga and as atoms ( designated as bi@xmath8 and bi@xmath9 in fig .",
    "1 ) are geometrically and electronically inequivalent because the bi@xmath18ga and bi@xmath18as bonds have some different ionic characters due to a larger electronegativity of as compared to ga and bi atoms . here , bi@xmath8 positions 0.11  - higher than bi@xmath9 , and it has a 5@xmath19 core - level shift of 0.31 ev to lower binding energy relative to that of bi@xmath9 , in accordance with the measured value of @xmath30.4 ev from x - ray photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite . due to these asymmetric characters of the bi chains , the bi / gaas(110 ) interface produces the out - of - plane and in - plane potential gradients , as discussed below .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the calculated band structure of bi / gaas(110 ) with the band projection onto the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 orbitals of bi .",
    "it is seen that the band dispersion of the highest occupied surface state ( hereafter , designated as @xmath20 ) is nearly flat along the @xmath21 and @xmath22 lines while broad along the @xmath23 and @xmath24 lines , indicating a 1d electronic state  @xcite along the bi chains . as shown in fig .",

    "figure 2(c ) shows the pbe+soc band structure of bi / gaas(110 )  @xcite .",
    "the spin degeneracy of the @xmath20 state as well as other states is found to be lifted over the sbz except at the high - symmetry points ( i.e. , @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 points ) . obviously , the pbe+soc band projection [ fig .",

    ", we fit the @xmath34-dependent dispersion of the spin - split subbands of the ss state along the @xmath35 or @xmath36 direction by using the rashba hamiltonian @xmath37 = @xmath38 + @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the electron effective mass , @xmath41 the rashba parameter , and @xmath42 and * _ s _ * are a momentum operator and a spin angular momentum ( sam ) operator , respectively . here , the spin - dependent eigenvalues become @xmath43 = @xmath44 with the different values of @xmath40 and @xmath41 along the the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions . from the calculated band structure , the characteristic parameters of spin - split subbands such as the momentum offset @xmath45 and the rashba energy @xmath46 [ see the inset of fig .",

    "the present values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath41 at the high - symmetry points are listed in table i , together with those of previous rashba systems  @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath41 = 4.94 ( 2.27 ) ev  along @xmath27 ( @xmath47 ) is larger than 1.86 ( 1.09 ) ev  along @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , indicating an enhanced spin splitting along the @xmath6 direction parallel to bi chains  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the present values of @xmath41 are among the largest ones so far reported for rashba spin - split systems ( see table i ) .",

    "the former surface state is @xmath30.8 ev above the latter one .",
    "these dispersion features of the two surface states are generally similar to our band structure obtained using the pbe or pbe+soc calculation . in addition , according to the inverse photoelectron spectroscopy ( ips ) experiment of mclean and himpsel  @xcite , the bi monolayer on gaas(110 ) produced two unoccupied surface states around 0.9 and 1.9 ev above the bulk valence - band maximum ( vbm ) at the @xmath31 point . on the other hand , the ips experiment of hu @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite observed a pronounced bi - derived surface resonance state around 1.25 ev above @xmath26 at the @xmath31 point . noting that the band gap of the gaas bulk is about 0.9 ev , the 1.25 ev - peak in the latter ips data  @xcite may correspond to the second peak in the former ips data .",
    "@xcite from our pbe ( pbe+soc ) band structure , it is found that the positions of two lower unoccupied states at the @xmath31 point are 1.12 ( 1.12 ) and 1.56 ( 1.45 ) ev above the bulk vbm , respectively , in reasonable agreement with previous ips experiments  @xcite .",

    "the former hamiltonian is given by @xmath56 = @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the velocity of light and @xmath59 is a crystal potential , whereas the latter one represents the electrostatic energy of electric dipole moment in the surface electric field . in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we plot the @xmath60 planar - averaged electron charge densities ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) of the spin - split @xmath20 state at @xmath53 = 0.03 @xmath63 [ see the inset of fig .",
    "2(c ) ] away from the @xmath30 point along the @xmath24 line .",
    "it is seen that @xmath61 and @xmath62 exhibit some delocalization up to the third deeper gaas substrate layer .",
    "this delocalization feature strikingly contrasts with the spin - unpolarized case of @xmath64 [ see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] obtained using the pbe calculation without soc , which shows a highly localized charge character around bi atoms .",
    "also we note that the pbe+soc result for @xmath61 and @xmath62 shows the broad maximum consisting of two peaks , possibly due to bi@xmath8 and bi@xmath9 atoms .",
    "thus , we can say that the soc induces a large asymmetry of surface charge distribution , which in turn contributes to the rashba spin splitting by @xmath65 = @xmath66 @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "figure 3(b ) displays not only the the @xmath60 planar - averaged crystal potential @xmath59 as a function of @xmath55 but also the calculated integrand of @xmath65 for the spin - split eigenstates at @xmath53 .",
    "it is found that the magnitude of @xmath65 can be dominant at the positions near bi layer and the first gaas substrate layer . on the other hand , the contribution of electric dipole interaction to the rashba spin splitting can be expressed as @xmath68 = @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the surface electric field and @xmath71 is the dipole moment difference obtained from @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for @xmath61 and @xmath62 at @xmath53",
    ", we obtain their difference @xmath72 [ see fig .",
    "3(a ) ] and then calculate @xmath71 = @xmath180.19 @xmath11 along the @xmath55 direction .",
    "since @xmath59 around the bi layer represents a highly deep , asymmetric quantum well [ see fig .",
    "3(b ) ] , a sizable magnitude of @xmath68 can be expected by a very large surface electric field .",
    "it is noted that the asymmetric features of the heterogeneous gaas substrate as well as the bi chains composed of two geometrically and electronically inequivalent bi@xmath8 and bi@xmath9 atoms produce an asymmetric in - plane surface charge distribution as well as an in - plane potential gradient along the @xmath73 direction ( see fig . 2s of the supplemental material  @xcite ) , thereby contributing to the spin splitting through @xmath65 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus , we can say that the soc - induced asymmetries of the out - of - plane and in - plane surface charge distributions together with the out - of - plane and in - plane surface electric fields lead to the giant spin splitting in the bi / gaas(110 ) surface system .",
    "figure 2(e ) shows the helical spin texture with the in - pane and out - of - plane spin components along the constant - energy contours around the @xmath30 point , where the sam direction rotates anti - clockwise ( clockwise ) at the inner ( outer ) contour .",
    "note that the spins along the outer contour , located off from the @xmath50 or @xmath24 line , have the radial in - plane component ( directing perpendicular to constant energy contour line ) , indicating that the spin splittings involve some contribution of the dresselhaus effect  @xcite .",
    "such dresselhaus spin - orbit splittings may arise from the asymmetry of electrostatic potential or charge density in the bi layer ( composed of bi@xmath8 and bi@xmath9 ) and the heterogeneous gaas substrate .",
    "in addition , the bi / gaas(110 ) system has one mirror - plane @xmath74 symmetry with the @xmath75 plane ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , which is a combination of the proper rotation of 180@xmath76 ( about the @xmath6 axis ) with the inversion . therefore ,",
    "when the spin vectors move along the constant - energy contours from the irreducible part [ i.e. , the darkened area in the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) ] to the neighboring one through the mirror - plane @xmath74 symmetry , the @xmath77 and @xmath78 components change their sign but the @xmath79 component remains unchanged .",
    "consequently , the spin vectors at the points crossing the @xmath21 line are oriented perpendicular to the mirror plane , and the whole spin texture along the constant - energy contours also satisfies the time - reversal symmetry that reverses simultaneously the wavevector and spin [ see fig .",

    "in ( a ) , sam is drawn with a larger arrow head than oam . here , the sam vectors with the negative , zero , and positive out - of - plane components are represented with increasing brightness of the arrow head .",
    "the arrows for oam represent only the in - plane components .",
    "the values in ( b ) are given in units of @xmath82/2.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is noteworthy that the soc - induced asymmetric surface charge distributions of the @xmath20 state originate from the admixture of the bi @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 orbitals [ see fig .",
    "2(c ) and 2(d ) ] as well as their hybridization with ga and as @xmath10 orbitals ( see fig .",
    "3s of the supplemental material ) .",
    "these orbital mixings in the @xmath20 state result in the formation of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) .",
    "recently , park @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the existence of oam on the surfaces of high atomic number materials produces the electric dipole moment that interacts with the surface electric field , giving rise to a rashba - type spin splitting . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , the oam is present in the upper subband of the @xmath20 state and is oriented mostly parallel to the corresponding sam  @xcite , manifesting the interplay between orbital ordering and soc for the rashba - type spin splitting .",
    "it is interesting to note that , around the @xmath31 point and near the @xmath23 line , the planar component of spin vectors is mostly composed of @xmath77 .",
    "this feature of the spin texture is likely to be associated with the band structure of the @xmath20 state showing 1d character along the @xmath6 direction : i.e. , the direction of sam ( or oam ) is perpendicular to the electron group velocity @xmath83 = @xmath84@xmath85 which nearly points in the @xmath6 direction ( see fig .",
    "4s of the supplemental material ) .",
    "such a locking of sam ( or oam ) to the crystal momentum that maximizes the magnitude of @xmath68  @xcite can be utilized for the non - vanishing spin transport along the bi chains . figure 4(b )",
    "shows the values of the total spin polarization @xmath80 and the @xmath78 component along the @xmath23 and @xmath24 lines .",
    "we find that along the @xmath24 line the magnitude of @xmath78 is comparable to those of the parallel components .",
    "this sizable @xmath78 ( or @xmath86 ) component reflects the presence of the in - plane dipole moment and the in - plane potential gradient ( see fig 2s of the supplemental material  @xcite ) generated by two electronically different bi atoms bonding to ga and as atoms .",
    "we have predicted for the first time that bi zigzag chains self - assembled on a heterogeneous gaas(110 ) surface have a giant spin splitting with the in - plane and out - of - plane spin components . by means of the dft calculations",
    ", we revealed that this giant spin splitting originates from soc and electric dipole interaction which are significantly enhanced by the large asymmetric surface charge distribution and the large out - of - plane and in - plane potential gradients .",
    "it was thus demonstrated that the in - plane and out - of - plane asymmetry present in the bi / gaas(110 ) interface system plays an important role in the giant spin splitting .",
    "our findings are anticipated to stimulate current experimental and theoretical studies for exploration of the giant spin splitting in other 1d electron systems formed on heterogeneous iii - v semiconductor surfaces .",
