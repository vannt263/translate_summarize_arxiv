    "special relativity ( sr ) is valid at the largest energies available today @xcite .",
    "however the possible violation of the underlying lorentz symmetry presents us with new experimental and theoretical challenges .",
    "in particular , its violation has been considered as a possible evidence for planck scale physics , as some theories of quantum gravity predicts it @xcite .",
    "experiments and astrophysical observations are used to set stringent bounds upon the parameters describing these violations .",
    "broadly speaking , three basic scenarios have been explored : ( 1 ) non - dynamical tensor fields are introduced to determine preferred directions that break the lorentz symmetry .",
    "some instances of this are the myers - pospelov model @xcite together with qed in a constant axial vector background @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) a second scenario is to assume spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the lorentz symmetry as in the standard model extension of @xcite,@xcite , where such non - dynamical tensor fields are assumed to arise from vacuum expectation values of some basic fields belonging to a more fundamental theory .",
    "( 3 ) a third possibility has been introduced in @xcite .    there",
    "it is proposed that the laws of nature are not invariant under the whole lorentz group ( with 6 parameters ) but instead are invariant under subgroups of the lorentz group which still preserves the basic elements of sr like the constancy of the velocity of light .",
    "it was named very special relativity ( vsr ) . in general space isotropy and cp",
    "are violated but if cp is incorporated as a symmetry then the whole lorentz group is recovered .",
    "the most interesting of these subgroups are sim(2 ) ( with 4 parameters ) and hom(2 ) , ( with 3 parameters ) .",
    "these subgroups do not have invariant tensor fields besides the ones that are invariant under the whole lorentz group , implying that the dispersion relations , time delay and all classical tests of sr are valid for these subgroups too .",
    "new effects would be generated by parity violating and non - local terms .",
    "vsr admits the generation of a neutrino mass without lepton number violation nor sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the implications of this novel mechanisms could be tested at non - relativistic neutrino energies such as the end point of the electron spectrum in beta decay .",
    "vsr has been generalized to include supersymmetry @xcite , curved spaces @xcite , noncommutativity @xcite , cosmological constant @xcite , dark matter @xcite , cosmology @xcite and abelian gauge fields @xcite .",
    "some doubts about the phenomenology of hom(2 ) vsr has been presented in @xcite , arguing that it is unable to explain thomas precession , and further extended in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to consider non - abelian gauge fields in the context of vsr .",
    "we review the results of the abelian case @xcite in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we define the covariant derivative , the gauge transformations and the action for non - abelian fields .",
    "section 4 is then devoted to ssb of the vsr gauge symmetry , section 5 introduces the brst gauge fixing , in section 6 we discuss renormalizability and unitarity and section 7 contains the conclusions and open problems .",
    "in this section , we follow closely @xcite .",
    "let us consider a gauge field @xmath1 in vsr with gauge transformation @xmath2 where the wiggle operator is defined by : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the constant vector @xmath5 is a null vector and transforms multiplicatively under a vsr transformation so that any term containing ratios involving @xmath5 are invariant . in order to have the usual mass dimension for @xmath6",
    "a constant @xmath7 has to introduced and sets the scale of vsr effects .",
    "consider now a charged scalar field @xmath8 to be coupled to the gauge field and with gauge transformation @xmath9 it can be shown that the operator @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11 satisfies the fundamental property of transforming as @xmath8 does under gauge transformations : @xmath12 we will call @xmath13 the covariant derivative of @xmath8 . associated to this covariant derivative , we define the wiggle covariant derivative of the field @xmath8 by @xmath14 it reduces to @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "we will see below that using the wiggle covariant derivative in the action gives to @xmath8 a  mass .",
    "this can be seen integrating by parts to get the action @xmath17 .",
    "the field strength related to @xmath18 can be computed as @xmath19 \\phi & = - i f_{\\mu \\nu } \\phi ,   & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it is given by @xmath20 we call @xmath21 as the @xmath22 field strength",
    ". it does not coincide with @xmath23 which is also gauge invariant and will be used below to describe massive gauge fields .",
    "however , the difference between them must be gauge invariant @xmath24 we then define the @xmath1 wiggle field strength by @xmath25 where by construction : @xmath26    using the wiggle covariant derivative ( [ wcd ] ) we can write a gauge invariant action for the charged scalar coupled to the abelian gauge field . since @xmath27 is gauge invariant the action can have , besides the usual @xmath28 term , contributions involving the square of @xmath29 , so that the most general gauge invariant action quadratic in the gauge field is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a constant .",
    "that the action ( [ abelianaction ] ) describes a massive gauge field can mostly easily be seen in the simpler case where @xmath32 and disregarding the coupling to the scalar field .",
    "the free abelian field equation of motion derived from @xmath33 is then @xmath34 choosing as gauge condition a vsr type lorentz gauge @xmath35 , we get @xmath36 i.e. @xmath22 has mass @xmath7 .",
    "a similar argument shows that the scalar field also has mass @xmath7 .",
    "similarly for fermions coupled to an abelian gauge field we have the gauge invariant lagrangian @xmath37 and again it is possible to show that the fermionic field has mass @xmath7 .    in order to handle the non - local terms we use the definition @xmath38    notice that replacing the wiggle by the raw definitions still preserve the symmetry of the action but now describes massless particles instead of vsr massive particles .",

    "gauge fields may have different masses , as the standard model shows , we implement the spontaneous symmetry breaking in vsr with non - abelian gauge symmetry . in this way",
