    "actually there are no analytical methods enabling to solve an arbitrary initial or boundary value problems for nonlinear pdes that are not completely integrable .",
    "the majority of evolutionary pdes used to simulate non - linear transport phenomena is not completely integrable .",
    "yet it is of common knowledge that under certain conditions coherent structures formation take place in open dissipative systems , being simulated by pdes , that are not completely integrable .",
    "the analytical description of the coherent structures within the non - integrable models is of great interest , since analytical form of solution is more preferable in analyzing structures formation and evolution and , besides , they are widely used as a starting point for various asymptotic methods , for testing the numerical schemes and facilitating the stability analysis .    to obtain exact solutions to non - linear pdes ,",
    "various methods are used .",
    "besides the classical symmetry reduction scheme ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which is not effective in obtaining solutions with the given properties , there are employed techniques based on choosing a proper transformation ( or ansatz ) , turning the problem of finding out exact solutions to the algebraic one @xcite . in our previous study @xcite we employed a certain dialect of the the direct algebraic method to the hyperbolic generalization of burgers equation ( gbe ) . yet in the following publications @xcite we showed that within this methodology it is impossible to obtain the the solitary wave solution of gbe , occurring to exist for certain values of the parameters @xcite .",
    "this served us as a motivation for the developing the effective methods of approximations @xcite of solutions describing the coherent structures .",
    "actually we return to the subject of the analytical description of the coherent structures within the gbe model , using for this purpose quite different technique , namely , a generalized symmetry and the combination of the classical symmetry reduction with an ansatz - based method @xcite .",
    "the structure of the study is following . in section 2",
    "we show how it is possible , combining the classical reduction with the hirota - like ansatz , to linearize equation describing a set of travelling wave solution to gbe and obtain on this basis new periodic , kink - like and soliton - like solution . in the following section",
    "we show how it is possible to gain the linearization of the reduced gbe , using the painlev test . in section 4 , using the idea of conditional symmetry , we obtain a wide class of exact solutions to gbe , containing the functional arbitrariness . in section 5",
    "we give some examples of such solutions .",
    "in the final part of the study we make some conclusions and general remarks .",
    "let us consider a hyperbolic generalization of burgers equation @xcite : @xmath0    we are going to look for the wave patterns among the set of travelling wave ( tw ) solutions , i.e. solutions invariant with respect to translations generators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "so it is quite natural to employ the classical reduction scheme @xcite , and consider an over - determined system containing action of the generator @xmath3 on the solutions of gbe : @xmath4 @xmath5=u_t-\\mu\\,u_x={0}.\\ ] ] the classical theorems @xcite assure that system ( [ gbe])([classym ] ) is compatible and has non - trivial solutions .",
    "in fact , solving equation ( [ classym ] ) we obtain an ansatz @xmath6 inserting ansatz ( [ anstw ] ) into ( [ gbe ] ) , we obtain the following ode : @xmath7 the problem is that , generally speaking , equation ( [ redode ] ) is non - integrable , so , employing the classical reduction scheme we are not able to obtain analytical description to wave patterns .    in the following we use this scheme together with the hirota - like ansatz @xmath8 and show that under certain conditions such combination leads to a linear ode . inserting ( [ hirotalike ] ) into ( [ redode ] ) , we obtain the equation @xmath9 + \\psi(\\xi)\\,\\psi'(\\xi)\\bigl[\\psi''(\\xi)\\left ( a+3\\kappa-3\\mu^2\\tau\\right ) -\\psi'(\\xi)\\left(h- \\right.\\\\\\\\ \\left.-\\lambda\\,(m_1+m_2+m_3)+b\\mu\\right)\\bigr ] + \\left[\\psi'(\\xi)\\right]^3\\left(a-\\lambda\\,-2\\kappa+2\\mu^2\\tau\\right)=0.\\end{array}\\ ] ] one",
    "easily gets convinced by the direct inspection that the following statement holds :    [ lem1 ] ansatz ( [ hirotalike ] ) leads to the linear ode @xmath10 + ( h+b\\mu)\\psi''+(\\mu^2\\tau-\\kappa)\\psi'''=0,\\quad\\ ] ] provided that following conditions are fulfilled : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13    equation ( [ a ] ) is a third - order ordinary linear differential equation .",
