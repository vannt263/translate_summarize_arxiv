    "decay of correlations and related topics for hyperbolic dynamical systems have been studied for more than three decades since the works of bowen@xcite , ruelle@xcite and sinai@xcite . for the cases of discrete dynamical systems such as iterations of expanding maps and anosov diffeomorphisms , we nowadays have fairly good understanding on the rate of decay of correlations .",
    "( see @xcite and the references therein . ) on the contrary , for the cases of continuous dynamical systems such as anosov flows , the corresponding argument is much subtler and our knowledge is less satisfactory at present .",
    "a simple reason for the subtleness in the cases of flows is that the time-@xmath2-maps of hyperbolic flows are _ not _ hyperbolic ( but partially hyperbolic ) as there is no expansion or contraction in the flow direction .",
    "it is only recent that dolgopyat@xcite showed rapid decay of correlations for topologically mixing anosov flows and that liverani@xcite showed exponential decay of correlations for anosov flows preserving contact structures .",
    "still we do not know , for instance , whether we observe exponential decay of correations and quasi - compactness of the semi - groups of perron - frobenius operators for mixing ( or generic ) anosov flows .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study decay of correlations not for anosov flows but for a class of expanding semi - flows , suspension semi - flows of angle - multiplying maps on the circle , which we would like to view as a simplified model of the anosov flow .",
    "we consider perron - frobenius operators for the time-@xmath2-maps of such semi - flows and let them act on the anisotropic sobolev spaces introduced in @xcite .",
    "our main result is that , under a @xmath0generic condition on the ceiling function , the essential spectral radius of the action is bounded by the square root of the inverse of the minimum expansion rate .",
    "this leads to a precise description on decay of correlations , which resembles the results known for hyperbolic discrete dynamical systems@xcite , and extends the earlier result of m.  pollicott@xcite on exponential decay .",
    "actually a prototype of the argument in this paper has been appeared in @xcite , where a class of volume - expanding hyperbolic endomorphisms , called _ fat solenoidal attractors _ , were studied . in this paper",
    ", we will apply essentially the same idea to analyze the time-@xmath2-maps of the class of expanding semi - flows mentioned above .",
    "we emphasize that our intension is to display the idea in a simple setting and present this paper as a study for the cases of hyperbolic flows .",
    "for this reason , we will confine our argument to a rather restrictive setting , though it is not very difficult to extend it to more general classes of expanding semi - flows and transfer operators .",
