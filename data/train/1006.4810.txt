    "the geometry of algebraic curves underlying the structure of global fields of positive characteristic has shown its crucial role in the process of solving several fundamental questions in number theory . furthermore , some combinatorial formulas , such as the equation supplying the cardinality of the set of rational points of a grassmannian over a finite field @xmath7 , are known to be rational expressions keeping a meaningful and interesting value also when @xmath8 .",
