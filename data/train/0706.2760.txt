    "the understanding of quantum tunneling in mesoscopic systems has made huge progress in the past decades , to the point that nanofabricated devices are now being exploited as coherently tunneling two - level systems ( tlss ) for quantum information purposes.@xcite conceptually , a first breakthrough was the proper description of the coupling of an effective tls to an environment described by an oscillator bath.@xcite whether the system is an intrinsic tls ( e.g. a spin @xmath8 ) or the low - energy truncation of a more complicated entity ( e.g. the flux state of a squid ) , one can generally apply the oscillator bath theory when the environment is described by delocalized modes ( conduction electrons , phonons , photons , etc . ) and the couplings of the tls to each oscillator are weak . in many solid - states systems , however , it can be necessary to account for localized environmental excitations whose couplings to the tls are not weak .",
    "this type of environment is called `` spin bath '' @xcite and can not be mapped onto an oscillator bath .",
    "importantly , a spin bath environment can cause decoherence even at @xmath9 and is therefore of great relevance for quantum systems that are designed to show coherent dynamics , like qubits for quantum computation .",
    "the prototypical realization of a tunneling tls coupled to a spin bath is the giant spin of a single - molecule magnet ( smm).@xcite these molecular systems consist of a core of strongly interacting transition metal ions , surrounded by organic ligands . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the core of the molecule behaves effectively like a single large spin @xmath10 . when uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is present , the reversal of the spin direction requires - classically - a large energy , so that the spin direction can be frozen at very low @xmath3 .",
    "however , in the presence of a transverse magnetic field or a biaxial anisotropy , the spin direction can be reversed by tunneling through the anisotropy barrier.@xcite the electronic spins that form the smm are magnetically coupled to the nuclear spins that either belong to the magnetic ions themselves ( @xmath2mn , @xmath11fe ,  ) or to the surrounding ligand molecules ( @xmath6h , @xmath12c ,  ) . as a consequence of these couplings , the observation of macroscopic quantum tunneling of magnetization in smms @xcite",
    "can not be understood without invoking the dynamics of the nuclear spins themselves.@xcite the theoretical predictions for the role of nuclear spins in the magnetization tunneling of smms @xcite have been verified by a series of experiments on the fe@xmath13 compound.@xcite most remarkably , this material allows to change the isotopic composition of the sample , both by strengthening ( @xmath11fe @xmath14 @xmath15fe substitution ) and weakening ( @xmath6h @xmath14 @xmath7h substitution ) the hyperfine couplings , while leaving the electronic structure of the smms unaffected .",
    "as predicted , the rate of quantum relaxation of the magnetization was found to be directly related to the nuclear isotopic composition of the sample.@xcite more recently , the effect of isotopic substitution has been observed in the low-@xmath3 electronic specific heat of fe@xmath13 ( ref . ) and in the dephasing time of coherent electron spin precession in cr@xmath16ni.@xcite nuclear spin effects were also invoked in the interpretation of @xmath17sr data in isotropic molecules,@xcite and in an alternative description of the short - term magnetic relaxation in smms.@xcite all these works have analyzed the effect of the nuclei on the dynamics of the `` central spin '' , but a crucial aspect of the theory of the spin bath is that the tunneling of the central system has repercussion on the dynamics of the bath itself , so that the latter can not be simply regarded as an independent source of `` noise '' . until now ,",
    "the experiments to probe the electron spin dynamics have not been able to test this delicate aspect of the theory .",
    "to understand the details of the nuclear spin fluctuations , one should then look _ directly _ at the nuclear spins by means of low - temperature nmr experiments , performed under different regimes for the quantum dynamics of the electron spin .",
    "these experiments have been carried out by several groups,@xcite but an accurate analysis of their implications for the more general theory of nuclear - spin mediated quantum tunneling is still lacking .    in this work ,",
    "we present a comprehensive set of experiments on the dynamics of @xmath2mn nuclear spins in the mn@xmath0-ac smm , and we use our results for a critical assessment of the theory of the spin bath . our data provide definitive proof that the nuclear spin dynamics is strongly correlated with that of the central spin , that is , it can not be treated as an independent source of noise .",
    "indeed , we find that the nuclear spin fluctuations change dramatically when the tunneling dynamics of the central spin is modified , e.g. by an external magnetic field .",
    "in addition , we shall demonstrate that the nuclear spins remain in thermal equilibrium with the phonon bath down to the lowest temperatures ( @xmath1 mk ) accessible to our experiment , where the thermal fluctuations of the electron spins are entirely frozen out .",
    "this implies that there is a mechanism for exchanging energy between nuclei , electrons and phonons _ through the nuclear - spin mediated quantum tunneling of the central spin_. this is the point where the current theoretical description of macroscopic quantum tunneling in the presence of a spin bath needs to be improved .",
    "as regards the `` macroscopicness '' of the quantum effects observed in smms , we adopt leggett s view that the most stringent criterion is the `` disconnectivity'',@xcite @xmath18 , which roughly speaking is the number of particles that behave differently in the two branches of a quantum superposition .",
    "for instance , while a cooper pair box@xcite is a relatively large , lithographically fabricated device , the quantum superposition of its charge states involves in fact only one cooper pair , i.e. two electrons , and its disconnectivity is only @xmath19 . the matter - wave interference in fullerene molecules,@xcite for instance , is a much more `` quantum macroscopic '' phenomenon , since it means that 60 @xmath20 ( 12 nucleons + 6 electrons ) = 1080 particles are superimposed between different paths through a diffraction grating .",
    "for the spin tunneling in mn@xmath0-ac smms discussed here , we have 44 electron spins simultaneously tunneling between opposite directions , which places this system logarithmically halfway between single particles and fullerenes on a macroscopicness scale .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ experimental ] describes the physical properties of the sample used in the experiments , the design and performance of our measurement apparatus , and the methods of data analysis .",
    "section [ nsd ] presents the experimental results on the nuclear spin dynamics , starting with the nmr spectra , the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates in zero field , and their dependence on a longitudinal external field .",
    "we also study the nuclear relaxation in different mn sites within the cluster , and the effect of isotopic substitution in the ligand molecules . in section [ spint ]",
    "we discuss the thermal equilibrium between nuclear spins and phonon bath , the experimental challenges in optimizing it , and the indirect observation of magnetic avalanches during field sweeps . in section",
    "[ theory ] we give an introductory review of the theory of the spin bath , and apply its predictions to the calculation of the nuclear relaxation rate as observed in our experiments . together with the information on the thermal equilibrium of the nuclear spins",
    ", this will allow us to draw clear - cut conclusions on the status of our current theoretical understanding of quantum tunneling of magnetization .",
    "we conclude with a summary and implications of the results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we chose to focus our study on the well - known [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(o@xmath21cme)@xmath22(h@xmath21o)@xmath23 ( mn@xmath0-ac ) compound , which belongs to the family of smms with the highest anisotropy barrier . as we shall see below",
    ", the rationale for choosing a smm with high anisotropy barrier is that the electron spin fluctuations become slow on the nmr timescale already at temperatures of a few kelvin .",
    "the structure of the cluster @xcite ( fig . [ structure ] ) consists of a core of 4 mn@xmath24 ions with electron spin @xmath25 , which we shall denote as mn@xmath26 , and 8 mn@xmath27 ions ( @xmath28 ) on two inequivalent crystallographic sites , mn@xmath29 and mn@xmath30 [ fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) ] . within the molecular cluster ,",
    "the electron spins are coupled by mutual superexchange interactions , the strongest being the antiferromagnetic interaction between mn@xmath26 and mn@xmath29 ( ref . ) .",
    "the molecules crystallize in a tetragonal structure with lattice parameters @xmath31    and @xmath32  .",
    "the ground state of the molecule has a total electron spin @xmath33 and , for the temperature range of interest in the present work ( @xmath34 k ) , we may describe the electron spin of the cluster by means of the effective spin hamiltonian : @xmath35 commonly adopted parameter values are @xmath36 k , @xmath37 mk and @xmath38 @xmath17k as obtained by neutron scattering data,@xcite and for the @xmath39 tensor the values @xmath40 and @xmath41 from high - frequency epr.@xcite the uniaxial anisotropy terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be attributed to the single - ion anisotropy of the mn@xmath27 ions,@xcite which is due to the crystal field effects resulting in the jahn - teller distortions of the coordination octahedra , where the elongation axes are approximately parallel to the @xmath44-axis of the crystal . considering only the diagonal terms , the energy levels scheme would be a series of doublets of degenerate states , @xmath45 , separated by a barrier with a total height @xmath46 k [ fig . [",
    "structure](b ) ] .",
    "the transverse anisotropy terms , @xmath47 , lift the degeneracy of the @xmath48 states and allow quantum tunneling of the giant spin through the anisotropy barrier .",
    "we call @xmath49 the matrix element for the tunneling of the giant spin through the @xmath50-th doublet , and @xmath51 the corresponding tunneling splitting .",
    "the @xmath52 term arises from the fourfold @xmath53 point symmetry of the molecule , but there is now solid experimental evidence @xcite for the prediction @xcite that a disorder in the acetic acid of crystallization is present and gives rise to six different isomers of mn@xmath0 cluster , four of which have symmetry lower than tetragonal and therefore have nonzero rhombic term @xmath54 .",
    "epr experiments give an upper bound @xmath55",
    "mk.@xcite for the purpose of nmr experiments , such isomerism may cause slight variations in the local hyperfine couplings , causing extra broadening in the @xmath2mn resonance lines .",
    "very recently , a new family of mn@xmath0 clusters has been synthesized , which does not suffer from the solvent disorder mentioned above , and yields indeed more sharply defined @xmath2mn nmr spectra.@xcite    when adding spin - phonon interactions,@xcite the possible transitions between the energy levels of ( [ hamiltonianmn12 ] ) are sketched in fig .",
    "[ structure](b ) .",
    "we distinguish between _ intrawell _ spin - phonon excitations , where the spin state remains inside the same energy potential well , and the _ interwell _ transitions , which involve spin reversal by quantum tunneling through the barrier , allowed by the terms in ( [ hamiltonianmn12 ] ) that do not commute with @xmath56 .",
    "thermally - assisted tunneling involves both these types of transitions .",
    "the above discussion refers to the majority of the molecules in a real sample , but for our experiments the crucial feature of mn@xmath0-ac is the presence of fast - relaxing molecules ( frms),@xcite i.e. clusters characterized by a lower anisotropy barrier and a much faster relaxation rate , as observed for instance by _ ac_-susceptibility@xcite and magnetization measurements.@xcite it has been recognized that such frms originate from jahn - teller isomerism,@xcite i.e. the presence in the molecule of one or two mn@xmath27 sites where the elongated jahn - teller axis points in a direction roughly perpendicular instead of parallel to the crystalline @xmath44-axis .",
    "this results in the reduction of the anisotropy barrier to 35 or 15 k in the case of one or two flipped jahn - teller axes , respectively,@xcite and presumably in an increased strength of the non - diagonal terms in the spin hamiltonian as well .",
    "furthermore , the anisotropy axis @xmath57 of the whole molecule no longer coincides with the crystallographic @xmath44-axis , but deviates e.g. by @xmath58 in the molecules with 35 k barrier.@xcite the jahn - teller isomerism is very different from the above - mentioned effect of disorder in solvent molecules , and produces much more important effects for the present study . as will be argued below , the presence of the frms is essential for the interpretation of our results and , to some extent , may be regarded as a fortunate feature for this specific experiment .    the sample used in the experiment consisted of about 60 mg of polycrystalline mn@xmath0-ac , with typical crystallite volume @xmath59 mm@xmath60 .",
    "the crystallites were used as - grown ( i.e. , not crushed ) , mixed with stycast 1266 epoxy , inserted in a @xmath61 6 mm capsule and allowed to set for 24 hours in the room temperature bore of a 9.4 t superconducting magnet . with this procedure",
    ", the magnetic easy axis of the molecules ( which coincides with the long axis of the needle - like crystallites ) ends up being aligned along the field within a few degrees .",
    "in addition , we shall report nmr spectra taken on a small single crystal ( mass @xmath62 mg ) .",
    "our experimental setup is based on a leiden cryogenics mnk126 - 400rof dilution refrigerator , fitted with a plastic mixing chamber that allows the sample to be thermalized directly by the @xmath60he flow .",
    "a scheme of the low - temperature part of the refrigerator is shown in fig .",
    "[ dilution+temperatures ] , together with the nmr circuitry .",
    "the mixing chamber consists of two concentric tubes , obtained by rolling a kapton foil coated with stycast 1266 epoxy .",
    "the tops of each tube are glued into concentric araldite pots : the inner pot receives the downwards flow of condensed @xmath60he and , a few millimeters below the inlet , the phase separation between the pure @xmath60he phase and the dilute @xmath60he/@xmath63he phase takes place . the circulation of @xmath60he is then forced downwards along the inner kapton tube , which has openings at the bottom side to allow the return of the @xmath60he stream through the thin space in between the tubes .",
    "both the bottom of the kapton tail and the outer pot are closed by conical araldite plugs smeared with apiezon n grease .",
    "a 2-turns copper coil is wound around the capsule containing the sample , mounted on top of the lower conical plug and inserted in the @xmath60he/@xmath63he mixture at the bottom of the mixing chamber tail , which coincides with the center of a 9 t superconducting magnet .",
    "the coil is then connected by a thin brass coaxial cable ( length @xmath64 m ) to two tunable cylindrical teflon capacitors , mounted at the still ( see fig .",
    "[ dilution+temperatures ] ) . at the frequency where the cable connecting capacitors and coil is precisely one wavelength",
    ", the circuit is equivalent to a standard lumped @xmath65-resonator .",
    "however , since the @xmath66-cable is a low - conductivity coax for low-@xmath3 applications , the quality factor of the resonator ( which includes the cable ) is drastically reduced .",
    "although this affects the sensitivity of the circuit , it also broadens the accessible frequency range without the need to retune the capacitors . cutting the cable for one wavelength at @xmath67 mhz , the circuit is usable between ( at least ) 220 and 320 mhz .",
    "as for the room - temperature nmr electronics , details can be found in ref . .",
    "the temperature inside the mixing chamber is monitored by two simultaneously calibrated speer carbon thermometers , one in the outer top araldite pot , and the other at the bottom of the kapton tail , next to the sample . at steady state and in the absence of nmr pulses , the temperature along the mixing chamber is uniform within @xmath68 mk .",
    "the effect of applying high - power ( @xmath69 w ) nmr pulses is shown in fig .",
    "[ dilution+temperatures](a ) and ( b ) . a sudden increase in the measured temperature",
    "is seen both at the bottom and the top thermometer , and can be attributed to the short electromagnetic pulse .",
    "the temperature at the lower thermometer , i.e. next to the sample and the nmr coil , quickly recovers its unperturbed value , whereas the upper thermometer begins to sense the `` heat wave '' carried by the @xmath60he stream with a delay of about 3 minutes .",
    "this has the important consequence that we can use the upper thermometer to distinguish the effect of sudden electromagnetic radiation bursts from the simple heating of the @xmath60he/@xmath63he mixture , as will be shown in ",
    "[ superradiance ] below .",
    "the sample temperature is regulated by applying current to a manganin wire , anti - inductively wound around a copper joint just above the @xmath60he inlet in the mixing chamber . in this way we can heat the incoming @xmath60he stream and",
    "uniformly increase the mixing chamber temperature .    for the @xmath60he circulation we employ an oil - free pumping system , consisting of a 500 m@xmath60/h roots booster pump , backed by two 10 m@xmath60/h dry scroll pumps .",
    "the system reaches a base temperature of 9 mk , and the practical operating temperature while applying @xmath70-pulses is as low as 15 - 20 mk .",
    "the @xmath2mn nuclear precession was detected by the spin - echo technique .",
    "a typical pulse sequence includes a first @xmath71-pulse with duration @xmath72 @xmath17s , a waiting interval of 45 @xmath17s , and a 24 @xmath17s @xmath73-pulse for refocusing .",
    "given the heating effects shown in fig .",
    "[ dilution+temperatures ] , a waiting time of 600 s between subsequent pulse trains easily allows to keep the operating temperature around @xmath74 mk .",
    "moreover , at such low temperature the signal intensity is so high that we could obtain an excellent signal - to - noise ratio without need of averaging ,",
    "so that a typical measurement sequence took less than 12 hours . above 100 mk it proved convenient to take a few averages , but there the heating due to the _",
    "rf_-pulses became negligible , and the waiting time could be reduced to @xmath69 s.     and @xmath75 mk in the mn@xmath26 site .",

    "we preferred this technique to the more widely used saturation recovery @xcite because it avoids the heating effects of the saturation pulse train , but we checked at intermediate temperatures that the two methods indeed lead to the same value of lsr rate .",
    "an example of echo signals obtained as a function of the waiting time after the inversion pulse is shown in fig .",
    "[ echo3d](a ) . by integrating the echo intensity",
    "we obtain the time - dependence of the nuclear magnetization , @xmath77 , as shown in fig . [",

    "this is just an artifact that occurs when the nmr line is much broader than the spectrum of the inversion pulse , and does not mean that the length of the @xmath73-pulse is incorrect . since the @xmath2mn nuclei have spin @xmath81 , we fitted the recovery of the nuclear magnetization with : @xcite @xmath82 \\label{recovery}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the longitudinal spin relaxation rate .",
    "note that , in the simple case of a spin 1/2 , @xmath76 is related to the relaxation time @xmath83 by @xmath84 . the above multiexponential expression and its numerical coefficients",
    "are derived under the assumption that the @xmath85 multiplet is split by quadrupolar interactions , and it is possible to resolve the central transition within that multiplet . while earlier work indicated that all three manganese nmr lines are quadrupolar - split,@xcite more recent experiments on single crystal samples have questioned that conclusion,@xcite and thereby the applicability of eq .",
    "( [ recovery ] ) to the present experiments .",
    "even if other sources of line broadening hinder the visibility of the quadrupolar contribution , the condition for the absence of quadrupolar splitting is an exactly cubic environment for the nuclear site , which is not satisfied here .",

    "the decay of transverse magnetization @xmath89 can be fitted by a single exponential @xmath90 except at the lowest temperatures ( @xmath91 k ) , where also a gaussian component @xmath92 needs to be included : @xmath93    as regards the experiments to determine the nuclear spin temperature , the measurements were performed by monitoring the echo intensity at regular intervals while changing the temperature @xmath94 of the @xmath60he/@xmath63he bath in which the sample is immersed .",
    "recalling that the nuclear magnetization is related to the nuclear spin temperature @xmath95 by the curie law : @xmath96 and assuming that @xmath97 at a certain temperature @xmath98 ( e.g. 0.8 k ) , we can define a calibration factor @xmath99 such that @xmath100 and use that definition to derive the time evolution of the nuclear spin temperature as @xmath101 while the bath temperature is changed .",
    "due to the strong magnetic hysteresis of mn@xmath0-ac , it is important to specify the magnetization state of the sample since , as will be shown below , this parameter can influence the observed nuclear spin dynamics .",
    "therefore we carried out experiments under both zero - field cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) conditions , which correspond to zero and saturated magnetization along the easy axis , respectively .",
    "heating the sample up to @xmath102 k is sufficient to wash out any memory of the previous magnetic state .",
    "when the sample is already at @xmath103 k , the field - cooling procedure can be replaced by the application of a longitudinal field large enough to destroy the anisotropy barrier , e.g. @xmath104 t. importantly , the shift of the @xmath2mn nmr frequency with external field depends on the magnetization state of the sample:@xcite in a zfc sample each resonance line splits in two , one line moving to @xmath105 and the other to @xmath106 .",
    "conversely , in a fc sample only one line is observed , shifting to higher or lower frequency depending on the direction of @xmath107 relative to the magnetization direction .",

    "experimentally it is indeed well known@xcite that the relaxation of the magnetization in mn@xmath0-ac in zero field may take years at low @xmath3 , which means that the tunneling events are in fact extremely rare .",
    "based on this , we are forced to assume that tunneling takes place only in a small minority of the clusters , and that some additional mechanism takes care of the relaxation of the nuclei in molecules that do not tunnel .",
    "this is a very realistic assumption , since all samples of mn@xmath0-ac are reported to contain a fraction of frms,@xcite as mentioned in sect .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "moreover , since we are also able to monitor the sample magnetization , we verified that e.g. a fc sample maintains indeed its saturation magnetization for several weeks _ while nuclear relaxation experiments are being performed ( at zero field)_. this confirms that any relevant tunneling dynamics must originate from a small minority of molecules . on the other hand ,",
    "it also means that the observed nmr signal comes mainly from nuclei belonging to frozen molecules , thus there must be some way for the fluctuations in frms to influence the nuclear dynamics in the majority of slow molecules as well .",
    "one possibility is to ascribe it to the fluctuating dipolar field produced by a tunneling frm at the nuclear sites of neighboring frozen molecules . in that case",
    "we may give an estimate of @xmath76 using an expression of the form : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the perpendicular component of the fluctuating dipolar field produced by a tunneling molecule on its neighbors and @xmath122 is the tunneling rate .",

    "for these fluctuations to relax the nuclear magnetization in the entire sample , an additional mechanism is required which equilibrates the nuclear spin polarization across neighboring molecules , i.e. intercluster nuclear spin diffusion .",
    "our data on the transverse nuclear spin relaxation show that the intercluster spin diffusion is indeed present and effective .",
    "all the above observations confirm and support the picture of nuclear - driven quantum tunneling of magnetization as originally formulated by prokofev and stamp .",
    "however , a crucial outcome of our experiments is the demonstration that the nuclear spins are in thermal equilibrium with the lattice phonons down to the lowest temperatures , where only quantum tunneling fluctuations of the electron spins are still present .",
    "this observation can not be explained within the present theory of the spin bath .",
    "the implications of our results are potentially very profound , particularly because of the growing interest toward a coherent manipulation of spins for quantum information processing .",

    "this includes superconducting systems,@xcite quantum dots,@xcite nv centers in diamond@xcite and , of course , molecular magnets.@xcite we have investigated here the incoherent tunneling regime , but the theoretical formalism to describe the coupling between central spin and spin bath is identical in the case of coherent spin dynamics . therefore , the main finding of our work - that the role of phonons in the nuclear - spin mediated tunneling is currently lacking a proper description - suggests that also the contribution of the nuclear spin bath to the decoherence rate of realistic spin qubits may need to be revisited .",

    "<S> the description of the tunneling of a macroscopic variable in the presence of a bath of localized spins is a subject of great fundamental and practical interest , and is relevant for many solid - state qubit designs . </S>",
    "<S> most of the attention is usually given to the dynamics of the `` central spin '' ( i.e. , the qubit ) , while little is known about the spin bath itself . </S>",
    "<S> here we present a detailed study of the dynamics of the nuclear spin bath in the mn@xmath0-ac single - molecule magnet , probed by nmr experiments down to very low temperatures ( @xmath1 mk ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are critically analyzed in the framework of the prokofev - stamp theory of nuclear - spin mediated quantum tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the longitudinal relaxation rate of the @xmath2mn nuclei in mn@xmath0-ac becomes roughly @xmath3-independent below @xmath4 k , and can be strongly suppressed with a longitudinal magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the nuclear relaxation being caused by quantum tunneling of the molecular spin , and we attribute the tunneling fluctuations to the minority of fast - relaxing molecules present in the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse nuclear relaxation is also @xmath3-independent for @xmath5 k , and can be explained qualitatively and quantitatively by the dipolar coupling between like nuclei in neighboring molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this intercluster nuclear spin diffusion mechanism is an essential ingredient for the global relaxation of the nuclear spin bath . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the isotopic substitution of @xmath6h by @xmath7h leads to a slower nuclear longitudinal relaxation , consistent with the decreased tunneling probability of the molecular spin . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that , even at the lowest temperatures - where only @xmath3-independent quantum tunneling fluctuations are present - the nuclear spins remain in thermal equilibrium with the lattice phonons , and we investigate the timescale for their thermal equilibration . </S>",
    "<S> after a review of the theory of macroscopic spin tunneling in the presence of a spin bath , we argue that most of our experimental results are consistent with that theory , but the thermalization of the nuclear spins is not . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for an extension of the spin bath theory to include the effect of spin - phonon couplings in the nuclear - spin mediated tunneling process . </S>"
