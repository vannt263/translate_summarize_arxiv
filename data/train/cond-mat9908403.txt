    "the dielectric spectroscopy is known to be one of the most utilized method for dielectric and ferroelectric materials investigations ( see e.g.@xmath0}$ ] and references therein ) .",
    "physical information was obtained mainly via analysis of the frequency , temperature and other external parameters dependencies of the dielectric response maxima position .",
    "analysis of the dielectric spectra shape was practically absent .",
    "recently the observation of the spectral hole burning in the dielectric response of supercooled liquids@xmath1}$ ] had undoubtedly shown that similarly to the magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectra investigated in many details ( see e.q.@xmath2}$ ] ) the mechanisms of the dielectric spectra broadening have to be divided into homogeneous and inhomogeneous ones .",
    "this division is related to physical picture in what the fluctuations of the local field `` felt '' by the dipoles can be divided into the fast and slow comparing with the dipole relaxation . in such picture",
    "the fast and slow fluctuations are the sources of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening . in the ordinary dielectric and ferroelectric dipole - lattice relaxation and dipole - dipole interaction between the same dipoles",
    "can be the examples of homogeneous broadening mechanisms , whereas the interactions between the dipoles of the different kinds as well as the local electric field inducing by the impurities and the lattice imperfections are the examples of the inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms .",
    "the disordered ferroelectrics , polymers , supercooled liquids etc . with the strong internal random electric field",
    "are known to have the non - debye dielectric response related to the relaxation time distribution in broad frequency region .",
    "this behaviour is the consequence of the distribution for the barrier in the dipole many - well potential that induced by the random fields influence@xmath3}$ ] .",
    "therefore in disordered systems dipole - lattice relaxation can be the source of the inhomogeneous dielectric response broadening .    in the present paper we calculated for the first time the dielectric absorption line shape for an oscillator with memory for the homogeneous broadening mechanism with gaussian distribution of its resonance frequency for inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms .",
    "the distribution of relaxation time as inhomogeneous broadening mechanism as well as the conditions for the hole burning in the dielectric spectra are discussed .",
    "2.1    the intensity of dielectric absorption is known to be proportional to the number of electric dipoles which can be oriented by a.c . electric field whereas dipole - dipole interaction and relaxation processes tend to restore the thermal equilibrium state of the system . if the relaxation processes are slower than the rate of a.c .",
    "field absorption the number of the dipoles oriented along a.c .",
    "field increase and so the absorption decreases i.e. we are faced with the saturation of the response .",
    "let us begin with the simplest case without saturation when the relaxation processes are fast enough .",
    "in such a case they are the same in all the points a main contribution to the homogeneous broadening of dielectric spectra . in the systems with local random electric field",
    "the dipoles in different points `` feel '' the frequencies of lattice vibrations related to the distribution of the oscillator resonance frequencies . because it has to be @xmath4 dipoles ( @xmath5 - the whole number of the dipoles ) which `` feel '' the same field and so the same oscillator frequency @xmath6 these dipoles can be considered as a dipole packet ( like spin - packet in magnetic system ) .",
    "this packet absorption can be described as homogeneously broadened line @xmath7 with the width @xmath8 and the intensity defined by the ratio @xmath9 . in the limit of continuous distribution of the resonance frequencies given by @xmath10 with the width @xmath11",
    "we arrive to inhomogeneously broadened spectra at the condition @xmath12 . in such a case the absorption line shape can be represented as a convolution of the homogeneously broadened dipole - packets with resonance frequency distribution :    @xmath13    the detail calculations were performed for oscillator with memory defined by the decay function of the form@xmath14}$ ] @xmath15 the fourie - transform gives dielectric absorption as @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "if the distribution of resonance frequencies can be represented in gaussian form @xmath18 eq .  ( 1 ) with respect to @xmath19 yields the line represented in figure 1 for @xmath20 ( inhomogeneously broadened line ) .",
    "one can see that it is the envelope of the dipole - packets lines ( one of them depicted by doted lines ) . as the matter of fact eq .",
    "( 2 ) can be approximated by lorentzian centered at @xmath6 with full width @xmath21 at the half maximum for the case of small damping@xmath22}$ ] .",
    "one can see by comparing figure 1 and figure 2 calculated for such lorentzian shape of homogeneously broadened packets that such approximation is not bad at all .",
    "fig .  1 : the inhomogeneously broadened line of dielectric absorption as a function of frequency @xmath23 ( arbitrary units ) .",
    "solid line is a convolution of the dipole packet lines ( one of which is depicted as the dotted curve , see eq .",
    "( 3 ) ) with gaussian distribution of the maximums of intensities .",
    "2.2    in the case of strongly disordered systems like relaxor ferroelectrics polymers , supercooled liquids the distribution of relaxation time up to infinite one appears . in relaxor ferroelectrics the infinite time of relaxation",
    "is related to the dipole glass state at @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the freezing temperature .",
    "the distribution of the relaxation time itself can be the source of inhomogeneous broadening for the dielectric absorption line .",
    "on other hand the long relaxation time can lead to the saturation effects , i.e. to decreasing of the absorption .",
    "let us consider these phenomena in more the details .",
    "let us suppose that the dielectric response of the dipoles described by the decay function of relaxation type , i.e. @xmath26 can be written in the form of debye law @xmath27 with arrhenius law for relaxation time @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the height of the barrier between equivalent potential wells of a dipole .",
    "the existence of strong enough local random electric field has to influence the form of a dipole potential and so the form of the barrier and its height , namely @xmath30 for rectangular barrier this results into the following form relaxation time@xmath31 @xmath32 the final form of relaxation time dependence on @xmath33 can be obtained after averaging of eq.(9 ) over possible orientation of the electric dipole @xmath34 . for two - orientable dipole",
    "it yields@xmath3}$ ] @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) we substituted the product @xmath36 by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the effective dipole moment .",
    "the form of the dielectric absorption can be obtained by substituting eq .",
    "( 10 ) for @xmath39 into eq .",
    "( 6 ) with the subsequent averaging with the random field distribution function @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath41 eq .  ( 11 ) is equivalent to that with the relaxation time distribution @xmath42 @xmath43 introduced phenomenologically for many disordered systems .",
    "one can see that because for debye law the position of the dielectric absorption maximum is defined by the condition @xmath44 the distribution of @xmath39 leads to @xmath23 distribution , i.e. the line becomes inhomogeneously broadened .",
    "note , that some another mechanism , e.g. dipole - dipole interaction , can be the source of homogeneous broadening .",
    "when the width of distribution @xmath40 or @xmath42 is much larger than that of dipole packet the form of @xmath45 will be defined by @xmath40 or @xmath42 calculated early in many details for linear @xmath46}$ ] and nonlinear random field contribution@xmath47}$ ] .",
    "3.1    this phenomenon is a direct evidence in favor of inhomogeneous broadening of the line .",
    "it was widely applied in radio-@xmath48}$ ] and optic-@xmath46}$ ] spectroscopy for investigation of random field distribution function and relaxation processes in the solids .",
    "the hole burning in dielectric spectra was observed for the fist time recently@xmath1}$ ]",
    ". theoretical analysis of this phenomenon in dielectric spectra is very restricted .",
    "the physical background of hole burning is the saturation of one or some dipole - packets with the help of powerful a.c .",
    "electric field pulse with the frequency @xmath49 what belongs to the dipole - packet frequencies i.e. @xmath50 .    the time condition of this pulse application and recording of dielectric response has to satisfy the demand that the dipole - lattice relaxation as well as the spectral diffusion over the line envelope should not destroy the induced by a.c .",
    "pulse saturation of the dipole - packet .",
    "however partly the aforementioned processes of the system equilibrium state restoration shall disorder the dipoles and so decrease the hole on the dielectric spectra . in particular , the width of the hole @xmath51 depends on the degree of the packets overlapping what defines the velocity of a.c .",
    "pulse energy transfer over whole inhomogeneous line .",
    "for the case when these processes are very slow in approximation of lorenzian dipole - packet shape @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the saturation factor , what has to be large enough for hole burning , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) is the probability of induced by a.c .",

    "the shape of the dipole - packet is lorenzian .    3.2    let s briefly discuss the physical information what can be obtained from analysis of dielectric spectra shape and hole - burning",
    ".    first of all the dielectric spectra of the materials with non - debye type of dielectric response have to be inhomogeneously broadened .",
    "it is because such response is the manifestation of relaxation time distribution , which has to be the source of the lines inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "the hole burning can give a valuable information about homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening parameters .",

    "note , that under the condition @xmath60 or @xmath61 the hole burning is impossible because the spectra becomes only slightly inhomogeneous or completely homogeneous .",
