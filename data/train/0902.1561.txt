    "there is also no evidence of high - energy cut - off in the spectra of seven grbs detected with egret at energies @xmath6  mev .",
    "there could be an energy flux from grbs in the largely unexplored vhe @xmath0-ray regime comparable to that radiated in kev - mev or x - ray - to - radio energies .    in the context of standard models , photons with energies up to @xmath7  tev from grbs are expected .",
