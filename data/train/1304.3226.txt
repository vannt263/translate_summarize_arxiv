    "in certain situations , geometrical information of manifolds might be encoded in differential forms . in the presence of symmetries of the manifold via the action of a lie group ,",
    "the behavior of these differential forms under the group action may lead to a better understanding of the manifold itself . in some well known instances of actions of compact lie groups ,",
    "the action is of a particular type whenever the differential form may be extended to an equivariant one in the cartan model of equivariant cohomology @xcite ; this is the case for example in hamiltonian actions on symplectic manifolds @xcite , in hamiltonian actions on exact courant algebroids @xcite or in gauged wzw actions which are anomaly free @xcite and its generalizations @xcite .",
    "when the lie group is not compact , the cartan complex associated to the action in general does not compute the equivariant cohomology of the manifold , and therefore many of the results that hold for compact lie groups may not hold for the non - compact case .",
    "but since the cartan model is very well suited for studying the infinitesimal behavior of the differential forms with respect to the action of the lie algebra , it would be worthwhile knowing more about the relation between the cohomology of the cartan complex and the equivariant cohomology . in this paper",
    "we study this relation and we obtain some interesting results which in particular permit us generalize the conditions for cancellation of anomalies on gauge wzw actions developed by witten @xcite , to the case on which the gauge group is the non - compact group @xmath1 .",
    "the main ingredient of this work is the equivariant de rham complex developed by getzler @xcite whose cohomology calculates the equivariant cohomology independent whether the group is compact or not .",
    "we show that there is an inclusion of complexes of the cartan complex into the equivariant de rham one , and therefore we obtain a homomorphism between the cohomology of the cartan complex to the equivariant de rham cohomology .",
    "this in particular implies that any closed form in the cartan complex defines an equivariant cohomology class , but note that the converse may not be true .",
    "we furthermore show that there is a spectral sequence converging to the equivariant de rham cohomology such that its @xmath2-term is isomorphic to the cohomology of the cartan complex , and in this way an explicit relation between the cohomology of the cartan complex and the equivariant de rham cohomology is obtained .",
    "now , since the first page of this spectral sequence could be understood in terms of the differential cohomology of a lie group , we recall its definition and some of its properties and we reconstruct some calculations for the group @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude this work by applying our results to the gauged wzw actions whenever the gauge group is @xmath1 .",
    "we recall the result of witten which claims that the gauged wzw action on compact lie groups is anomaly free , if and only if the wzw term @xmath3 can be extended to a closed form in the cartan complex , and we generalize it to the case on which the gauge group is @xmath1 ; this is theorem [ equivalence of extension for sl(n , r ) ] .",
