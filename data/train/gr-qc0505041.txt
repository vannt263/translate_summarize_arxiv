    "the search for gravitational waves has entered a new era with the scientific operation of kilometer scale laser interferometers .",
    "these l - shaped instruments are sensitive to minute changes in the relative lengths of their orthogonal arms that would be produced by gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) @xcite consists of three fabry - perot - michelson interferometers : two interferometers are housed at the site in hanford , wa ; a single interferometer is housed in livingston , louisiana . in 2003 ,",
    "all three instruments simultaneously collected data under stable operating conditions during two science runs .",
    "even though the instruments were not yet performing at their design sensitivity , the data represent the best broad - band sensitivity to gravitational waves that has been achieved to date .    in this paper , we report the methods and results of a search for gravitational waves from binary neutron star systems , using data from the science run conducted early in 2003 .",
    "these waves are expected to be emitted at frequencies detectable by ligo during the final few seconds of inspiral as the binary orbit decays due to the loss of energy in gravitational radiation  @xcite .",
    "a previous search  @xcite , using data from the first ligo science run , reported an upper limit on the rate of coalescences within our galaxy and the magellanic clouds .",
    "this paper uses an analysis pipeline which is optimized for detection by using data only from times when interferometers were operating properly at both ligo sites . by demanding that a gravitational wave be seen at both sites",
    ", we strongly suppress the rate of background events from non - astrophysical disturbances .",
    "moreover , this approach allows us to judge the significance of any apparent event candidate in the context of the background distribution , which is also determined from the data .",
    "the search described here has essentially perfect efficiency for detecting binary neutron star inspirals within the milky way and the magellanic clouds ( as measured by monte carlo simulations ) , and could detect some inspirals as far away as the andromeda and triangulum galaxies ( m31 and m33 ) .",
    "the rate of coalescences in these galaxies , based on the population of known binary neutron star systems  @xcite , is expected to be very low , so that a detection by the present search would be highly surprising .",
    "in fact , no coincident event candidates were observed in excess of the measured background .",
    "the data are therefore used to place an improved direct observational upper limit on the rate of binary neutron star coalescence events in the universe .",
    "the ligo hanford observatory ( lho ) in washington state has two independent detectors sharing a common vacuum envelope , one with 4  km long arms ( h1 ) and one with 2  km long arms ( h2 ) .",
    "the ligo livingston observatory ( llo ) in louisiana has one detector with 4  km long arms ( l1 ) .",
    "all three detectors operated during the second ligo science run , referred to as s2 , which spanned 59 days from february 14 to april 14 , 2003 . during operation ,",
    "feedback to the mirror positions and to the laser frequency keeps the optical cavities near resonance , so that interference in the light from the two arms recombining at the beam splitter is strongly dependent on the difference between the lengths of the two arms .",
    "a photodiode at the antisymmetric port of the detector senses this light , and a digitized signal is recorded at a sampling rate of 16384  hz .",
    "this channel can then be searched for a gravitational wave signal .",
    "more details on the detectors instrumental configuration and performance can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while the detailed noise spectrum of a detector affects different gravitational wave searches in different ways , we can summarize the sensitivity of a detector for low - mass inspiral signals in terms of the range for an archetypal source .",
    "specifically , the range is the distance at which an optimally oriented and located binary system with the mass of each component equal to @xmath2 would yield an amplitude signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 8 when extracted from the data using optimal filtering . during the first ligo science run ( referred to as s1 ) ,",
    "the l1 detector had the greatest range , typically @xmath3  mpc . during the s2 run ,",
    "all three detectors were substantially more sensitive than this , with ranges of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6  mpc for l1 , h1 , and h2 averaged over all times during the run .",

    "the amount of science data with good performance and stable operating conditions was limited by environmental factors ( especially high ground motion at llo and strong winds at lho ) , occasional equipment failures , and periodic special investigations . over the 1415  hour duration of the s2 run , the total amount of science data obtained was 536  hours for l1 , 1044  hours for h1 , and 822  hours for h2 .",
    "the analysis presented here uses data collected while the llo detector was operating at the same time as one or both of the lho detectors .",
    "science data during which both h1 and h2 were operating but l1 was not , amounting to 385  hours , was not used in this analysis because of concerns about possible environmentally - induced correlations between the data streams of these two co - located detectors ; this data set , as well as data collected while only one of the ligo detectors was in science mode , will be used in a separate analysis together with data from the tama300 detector  @xcite , which conducted `` data taking  8 '' concurrently with the ligo s2 run .     the number of hours that each detector combination was operational during the s2 run .",

    "of all the data , approximately 9% ( uniformly sampled within the run so as to be representative of the whole data set ) was used as _ playground _ data for tuning parameters and thresholds in the analysis pipeline , and for use in identifying vetoes that were effective in eliminating spurious events .",
    "this playground data set was excluded from the gravitational wave inspiral upper limit calculation because event selection and pipeline tuning , as described in secs .",
    "[ s : triggers ] , [ s : vetoes ] and [ s : pipeline ] , introduces statistical bias which can not be accounted for .",

    "reference calibration functions , tracing out the frequency - dependent response of the detectors , were measured ( by moving the end mirrors of the detector with a known displacement ) before and after the science run , and once during the science run ; all three measurements gave consistent results .",
    "the changing optical gain of the calibration was monitored continuously during the run by applying sinusoidal motions with fixed frequency to the end mirrors .",

    "this population includes the local group of galaxies , whose total blue - luminosity is dominated by the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , as well as some galaxies from neighboring groups . we can not hope to detect _ all _ inspirals within this volume , because most systems in the population have lower masses and because the received signal amplitude is reduced , on average , depending on the orientation and location of the source relative to the detector .",

    "the loudest candidate is in a cluster of three coincident triggers in l1 and h2 on march 28 , 2003 .",
    "the loudest trigger in the cluster , #  1 in table  [ t : loudest ] , has a large snr in l1 ( @xmath20 ) , but an snr in h2 ( @xmath21 ) which is close to threshold for trigger generation .",
    "we expect a candidate arising from a real signal to be robust under small changes in our analysis pipeline . in order to test the robustness of this particular candidate upon changes in the boundaries for the chunks used in the analysis ,",
    "we re - analyzed the data in this science segment shifting the start time of the chunk by different amounts in l1 and h2 .",
    "although in all cases our analysis produced similar numbers of triggers in each detector , only in the original case were there triggers within 11  ms that had identical masses and were considered candidates .",
    "other measured parameters of this trigger re - inforce the conclusion that it should not be promoted to a detection candidate .",
    "the @xmath22 per degree of freedom is bad , especially in h2 ( 3.4 ) ; the @xmath22 in l1 is close to our threshold [ @xmath23 compared to the threshold @xmath24 .",
    "the effective distances measured by the detectors are very different , 2.1 mpc in l1 and 0.9 mpc in h2 .",
    "this ratio of effective distances and the large time delay ( 10 ms ) is unlikely , though not impossible , for the posited population .",
    "the other triggers in the cluster ( with smaller snr by definition ) have a larger distance ratio , smaller time delay , smaller @xmath22 , and different masses in the binary system ( but the same masses in both triggers ) : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the time series in the h2 detector does not show anything unusual in the gravitational wave channel or in other auxiliary channels : this is consistent with the small snr measured in h2 for this trigger .",
    "the time series in l1 , however , shows several disturbances in a few second window around the candidate .",
    "many inspiral triggers are generated at the time although only three are coincident in mass and time with h2 triggers .",
    "just 100 ms before the coalescence time of the trigger in question ( and within the duration of the template corresponding to the trigger ) , we observed a fast fluctuation in the calibration , less than 62  ms in duration , indicating low optical gain dropping to levels that would make the feedback loop unstable .",
    "in the 51 minutes when the l1 detector was operational around the time of the candidate , such a low loop gain happened at three different instances .",
    "each occurrence lasted less than 62  ms and was accompanied by a cluster of inspiral triggers generated by the search code . since we averaged the calibration on a 60-second time scale ,",
    "these rare fluctuations had not been observed when considering data quality .",
    "nevertheless , such a low gain , even though brief , makes the data and its calibration very unreliable .",
    "this provides an instrumental reason to veto this trigger as a detection candidate : the cluster of triggers in l1 containing the coincident trigger was probably produced by non - linear effects associated with either the low gain itself or the alignment fluctuation that produced the low gain in the first place .",
    "an indication of this is that most of the excess power at the time of the trigger cluster is at sidebands of a narrow line in the spectrum , corresponding to up - conversion of low - frequency noise to the 120 hz electric power line harmonic by some unknown bilinear process .      the second loudest candidate in table  [ t : loudest ] is on march 27 , 2003 ; it is also an l1-h2 trigger , with a combined snr @xmath27 .",
    "similar to the loudest candidate , according to the background estimates , it has a 20% false alarm probability .",

    "[ trigger030327 ] , there are four bursts of noise in the gravitational wave channel of the h2 detector in the 58 minutes surrounding this candidate when l1 and h2 were operating in coincidence .",
    "each burst is a few to ten seconds long , and each triggers a large fraction of the template bank .",
    "trigger 030327 is the loudest trigger in a cluster of seven l1-h2 coincident triggers , in a 3  ms interval , during one of the h2 noise bursts .",
    "there are also three other coincident triggers in the same noise burst , and there are clusters of coincident triggers in two of the other three h2 noise bursts .",
    "one of these bursts , with several coincident triggers , contains another one of our top twenty loudest candidates .",
    "the only noise burst that does not have any coincident triggers happens at a time when the h1 detector had begun operating , and the triple - coincidence criteria were not satisfied . in almost all of the time - shifts used to estimate the background ,",
    "there were a number of l1-h2 coincident triggers at the time of the noise bursts in h2 .",
    "we have not found the precise instrumental origin of the disturbances causing such large numbers of inspiral triggers : although simultaneous disturbances are observed in a few other auxiliary channels , none of them are as obvious as they are in the gravitational wave channel .    .",
    "the black points indicate the triggers that have identical mass and are coincident within a 11 ms window .",

    "the dashed lines are the boundaries of the science segments in each detector ( i.e , h1 and h2 were not operating to the left of the dashed line in their respective graphs , and l1 was not operating after the dashed line in the top panel ) .",
    "[ trigger030327 ] ]    despite a relatively low measured probability of this trigger being due to the background , we do not consider this trigger an event candidate due to the low snr in the l1 detector , the poor @xmath22 , the unlikely parameters , and a strong suspicion of instrumental misbehavior .",
    "we also followed up the third loudest candidate on feb 24 , 2003 .",
    "this is again an l1-h2 candidate , happening a few minutes before h2 turns off due to loss of the operating point at optical resonance .",
    "we discovered a very large feedback loop oscillation in an auxiliary servo operating in the orthogonal channel to the gravitational channel ( l1:lsc - as_i ) .",
    "although the oscillation was at lower frequencies than the ones relevant for our search , it produced broadband excess power at all frequencies in two short time intervals , at the beginning and at the end of the oscillation .",

    ", the average instrument response @xmath78 was constructed for every minute of data during s2 from a reference sensing function @xmath79 , a reference open loop gain function @xmath80 , and a parameter @xmath81 representing varying optical gain .",
    "the response function at a time @xmath82 during the run is given by @xmath83 .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 was reconstructed using the observed amplitude of a calibration line .",
    "if an inspiral signal is present in the data , errors in the calibration can cause a mismatch between the template and the signal",
    ". we can quantify and measure this effect using simulated injections , both in software and hardware .",
    "for such injections , the snr differs from the snr that would be recorded for a signal from a real inspiral event at the same distance as the injection .",
    "the effect is linear in amplitude errors causing either an upward or downward shift in snr ; in contrast , the effect is quadratic in phase errors causing an over - estimation of sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "this error is propagated to our upper limit by shifting the efficiency curve in fig .  [",
    "f : eff_vs_snrsq ] horizontally by the appropriate amount .",
    "a careful evaluation of uncertainties in the s2 calibration  @xcite has shown that amplitude errors have two dominant components .",
    "the first source of error , an imperfect knowledge of the strength of the feedback actuators in the system , produces an error in the overall amplitude of the sensing function @xmath79 .",
    "thus , it manifests as a systematic error in the amplitude of the response function , constant during the whole run .",
    "this error was estimated to be 8.5% in l1 , 3.5% in h1 , and 4.5% in h2 .",
    "the second dominant source of error is an imprecise measurement of the amplitude of the calibration line , resulting in an error of the coefficient @xmath81 .",
    "this measurement error is mostly random in nature , and leads to magnitude and phase errors in the response function .",
    "these errors translate into maximum amplitude errors in the response function equal to 6% for l1 and h2 , and 18% for h1 .",
    "another source of error in @xmath81 , which is not captured in the errors as estimated above , is due to changes in optical gain that are averaged over the 60 second integration time used in the measurement of @xmath81 .",
    "based on a limited set of diagnostics , we roughly estimate these errors can be as large as 10% in l1 , and smaller in h1 and h2 .",
    "the errors in @xmath84 , including these fast fluctuations , are random in nature , and are not expected to contribute to the error in the measured efficiency .",
    "the snr used in the final analysis is constructed from the individual snr s @xmath85 and @xmath86 as given in eq .",
    "( [ e : combined - snr ] ) .",
    "the error in snr then has two pieces @xmath87 we assume fractional errors equal to the maximum errors in calibration at each site and arising from the systematic uncertainty in the detector response ( 8.5% in l1 , and 4.5% for lho ) .",
    "this results in a conservative estimate of the error at the largest observed snr : @xmath88 the resulting error on @xmath18 is @xmath89    simulations of the contributions to @xmath90 from the random fluctuations of @xmath84 , assuming the largest possible error in h1 ( 18% ) , made negligible contributions to the error due to calibration , as expected .",
    "since we use matched filtering to search for gravitational waves from inspiralling binaries , differences between the theoretical and the real waveforms could also adversely effect the results .",
    "these effects have been studied in great detail for binary neutron star systems  @xcite .",
    "the results indicate a @xmath72 loss of snr due to inaccurate modelling of the waveforms for binaries in the mass range of interest .",
    "this feeds into our result through our measurement of the efficiency",
    ". we may be over - estimating our sensitivity to real binary inspiral signals ; the estimated loss of efficiency results in an error on @xmath91 of @xmath92    the effects of discreteness of the template placement , errors in the estimates of the power spectral density @xmath93 used in the matched filter in eq .",
    "( [ e : xfilter ] ) , and trends in the instrumental noise are all accounted for by the monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the error in the efficiency measurement due to the finite number of injections is estimated as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of injections made for each galaxy .",
    "the total error from the monte carlo is @xmath96      combining the errors in quadrature yields total errors @xmath97 to be conservative , we assume the downward excursion @xmath98 when using eq .",
    "( [ eq : limitng ] ) to derive an observational upper limit on the rate of binary neutron star coalescence @xmath99 where we have used @xmath100 and @xmath44 .",
    "using data from the second ligo science run ( s2 ) , we have significantly improved our methods and strategies to search for waveforms from inspiraling neutron stars .",
    "the search has been optimized for detecting signals , rather than for setting optimal upper limits on the rate of sources  @xcite . in order to increase confidence in a detection candidate , we used data only when two or more detectors are operating .",
    "we performed extensive validations of the detection efficiency of our search using software and hardware signal injections . using these injections",
    ", we tuned the parameters in our search to take advantage of the increased reach of the detectors in the s2 run and have almost 100% efficiency for signals in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "( due to the antenna pattern , we can not be 100% efficient . )",
    "we also achieved an average 6% efficiency for sources in the andromeda galaxy , at a distance of 770 kpc , near the typical maximum range of our second best detector ( h1 , 900 kpc ) . using the same detection pipeline , but shifting in time the data from the two observatories , we quantified the accidental rate for our pipeline .",
    "this allows evaluation of our confidence that any candidate is a true signal .",
    "the search of 373 hours of double- and triple - detector data during s2 resulted in no detection : the strongest candidate from the search , arising from coincidence between l1 and h2 , had a combined signal - to - noise of 9.4 .",
    "our background estimate suggests that noise has a 20% probability of causing a candidate with this signal - to - noise or greater .",
    "moreover , the weight of evidence from follow - up investigations suggests that this trigger originated with a burst of noise which corresponded to a brief period of servo instability .",
    "the detailed investigations presented in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] exemplify typical follow - up of coincident triggers which appear unlikely to arise from background .",
    "we have found no evidence of a gravitational wave event from binary neutron star inspiral . without a detection ,",
    "the 339 hours of non - playground data were used to place an upper limit on the rate of binary neutron star coalescence in the universe .",
    "this search was sensitive to binary inspiral signals from neutron star coalescence in the local group and other galaxies at distances of up to about 1.5  mpc .",
    "we used monte carlo simulations to measure the efficiency of our search to non - spinning neutron stars in this population .",
    "we conclude that the rate of binary neutron star coalescence is @xmath101 with 90% confidence .",
    "this rate limit is significantly greater than astrophysically plausible rates  @xcite , but it illustrates the performance of the search .",
    "it should be noted that the analysis of the first science run  @xcite was optimized to yield the lowest upper limit , while the method presented here was not .",
    "in particular , the decision to only use data when the livingston interferometer _ and _ one of the hanford interferometers were operating limited the observation time to 1/3 of the total data collected .",
    "analysis of the remaining data collected in coincidence with tama will be reported elsewhere  @xcite .    in this paper , we have presented a data analysis strategy that could lead to a detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron star inspirals .",
    "the methods used to validate the search illustrate the subtleties of the analysis of several detectors with different sensitivities and orientations .",
    "moreover , the experience gained by following up the largest coincident triggers will be crucial input to investigations of event candidates that are identified in future searches .    the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the united states national science foundation for the construction and operation of the ligo laboratory and the particle physics and astronomy research council of the united kingdom , the max - planck - society and the state of niedersachsen / germany for support of the construction and operation of the geo600 detector .",
