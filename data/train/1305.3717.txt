    "two parameters couple to the angular pairing oscillations : a pancake trapping potential with @xmath20 encourages the unpaired majority spin atom into a doubly degenerate transverse orbital ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) , whereas a central barrier @xmath23 favors occupation of the singly degenerate longitudinal orbital ( @xmath24 ) that has a node over the barrier .",

    "we use both exact diagonalization and first order perturbation theory to probe the boundary between the transverse and longitudinal states . starting from the non - interacting states in the absence of the central barrier we include both the interactions and the barrier through first order perturbation theory to yield the estimates for the ground state energy    @xmath25    setting the two energies equal predicts a crossover at @xmath26    in fig .

    "the critical barrier height falls with rising interaction strength due to the inhomogeneous pairing pulling density onto the central barrier and so favoring the longitudinal mode that has a node over the barrier . with spherically symmetric",
    "pairing this transition would be independent of interaction strength so its gradient exposes the inhomogeneous pairing .",
    "the transition could be exposed by starting from four trapped atoms and tilting the trap so that one atom escapes , with the other three atoms entering the ground state .",
    "the tunneling rate , proportional to ground state degeneracy , will be twice as large for the transverse mode than the longitudinal thus mapping the boundary .    as demonstrated in fig .",

    "the critical interaction strength is a minimum at the transverse / longitudinal boundary at @xmath34 since those two states are most unstable here .",
    "the transverse state is more stable as the central barrier is reduced , whereas the molecule with density sited over the barrier becomes less favorable with increasing barrier height than the longitudinal mode that has a node over the barrier .",

    "the ground state of more atoms can be understood in terms of the excited states of the @xmath19 system .",
