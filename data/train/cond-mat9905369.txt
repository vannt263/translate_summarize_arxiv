    "the continous increase of laser intensity is making possible the study of a wide range of non - linear phenomena in atoms , plasmas and solids under the action of intense electromagnetic radiation @xcite .    in the last decade",
    "these studies have been extended to semiconductor nanostructures under intense electric fields , originated by an applied ac voltage or a high - intensity infrared laser . at frequencies of the order of @xmath0 , typical of free - electron lasers , photon energies are comparable to the energy separation of the electronic levels and nanostructures couple strongly to the electromagnetic field .",
    "in the case of semiconductor superlattices of period @xmath1 , driven by electromagnetic radiation of frequency @xmath2 , amplitude @xmath3 and polarized in a direction perpendicular to the interfaces , the i vs v curves are modified and non - linear behaviour is observed .",
    "holthaus @xcite has predicted the collapse of minibands and the dynamical localization of electrons with the corresponding supression of the coherent tunneling current if @xmath4 is a zero of the bessel function @xmath5 , being @xmath6 . as a consequence of tucker s formula @xcite , tunneling processes in which the absorption or emission of n photons take place",
    "are inhibited when @xmath4 is a zero of @xmath7 .",
    "sequential photon - assisted tunneling , with differential negative resistivity , dynamical electron localization , formation of electric field domains and absolute negative conductance for low applied voltages have been observed experimentally @xcite . in the miniband transport regime",
    "the effect of inverse bloch oscillations has been reported @xcite .",
    "many of these phenomena have been theoretically explained @xcite and several interesting predictions have been made : oscillations of the superlattice reflection coefficient of the radiation due to dynamical electron localization @xcite , step - like behaviour of the interminiband multiphotonic absorption coefficient @xcite , spontaneous breaking of temporal symmetry with the appearance of a dc current in presence of an ac voltage @xcite and the occurrence of rabi oscillations when @xmath8 is close to the energy difference between two minibands @xcite .",
    "a new kind of microwave frequency multiplier , an ultra - fast detector of @xmath9 radiation and a bloch laser based in the driven motion of the electrons in one miniband have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of a superlattice of period @xmath1 under the action of a magnetic field @xmath10 perpendicular to the growth direction has also been well studied @xcite . instead of bloch minibands ,",
    "one has landau magnetic subbands , with energies @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) is the position of the centre of the cyclotronic orbit , @xmath14 is the momentum along the magnetic field direction and @xmath15 the conduction electron effective mass .",
    "let @xmath16 be the magnetic length .",
    "if the ratio @xmath17 , the first subbands are almost flat and those of higher index @xmath18 present a dispersive character . if @xmath19 , all subbands are dispersive .",
    "the difference between these two regimes is observed in optical intraband absorption at frequencies close to that of cyclotronic resonance @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the dispersion of magnetic subbands makes possible tunneling in the growth direction , which occurs via transitions between consecutive subbands in the anti - crossing points @xcite .",
    "this work considers a new , combined situation , in which a superlattice undergoes the action of a magnetic field perpendicular to its growth direction and intense electromagnetic radiation , linearly polarized in a direction perpendicular to @xmath21 .",
    "we search for the occurrence of effects such as the collapse of magnetic subbands and electronic localization similar to those predicted for bloch minibands .",
    "the magnetic field introduces a new characteristic frequency ( the cyclotron frequency ) in the system under consideration , and an enhanced effect of the external electromagnetic field is expected near the resonance conditions .",
    "additionally , @xmath21 couples the motion in the directions perpendicular to it and , therefore , a similar result should be observed for waves polarized in either of these directions .",
    "we have found that non - linear effects become important for relatively lower intensities and radiation polarized in any direction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "quasienergies and density of states in the kramers - henneberger approximation are calculated and the conditions under which collapse of magnetic subbands and supression of n - photon absorption or emission processes occur are analyzed .",
    "let @xmath22 be the growth direction of the superlattice and @xmath23 the magnetic field direction .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation of frequency @xmath24 and amplitude @xmath3 can be polarized either in @xmath22 or @xmath25 directions .    in the effective mass approximation , the envelope wavefunction of a conduction electron can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transverse area of the sample , and @xmath15 is the conduction electron effective mass .",
    "we have considered that @xmath15 is constant , independent of @xmath28 .",
    "the validity of this , commonly used , approximation has been discussed in @xcite . the time - dependent unitary transformation @xmath29 is given by @xcite : @xmath30 with the choice @xmath31 for @xmath32 , the function @xmath33 satisfies the equation @xmath34 where @xmath35\\\\ & & x_0=\\frac{l_b^2}{\\hbar}q\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath36 are the fourier coefficients of the superlattice potential : @xmath37 and @xmath38 takes values @xmath39 or @xmath40 for electromagnetic waves polarized along @xmath22 or @xmath25 axis .",
    "the effect of radiation is expressed in the `` dressed '' potential @xmath41 , which renormalizes magnetic subbands , and the superposition of harmonic terms with amplitude @xmath42 , giving raise to n - photon emission and absorption processes . the dynamical stark effect is included in eq.([choice ] ) for @xmath43 as a phase shift of the wavefunction , and is given by @xmath44 when @xmath45 , @xmath46 and standard time - dependent perturbation theory can be applied .",
    "non - linear effects become important for @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48 , all @xmath49 have the same order of magnitude and @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath2 is close to @xmath51 , @xmath52 is relatively small .",
    "for example , if @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , then @xmath56 .",
    "this corresponds to intensities about @xmath57 , which can be reached with a c.w .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of recombination processes and many - body effects due to high levels of photoexcitation need not to be considered .",
    "quasienergies @xmath58 are the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath59 @xcite and can be obtained from the poles of @xmath60 , the retarded green s function averaged over a period @xmath61 of the initial time .",
    "the kramers - henneberger approximation ( kha ) , widely used in atoms @xcite , approximates @xmath62 by the eigenvalues of @xmath63 and corresponds to the zeroth order term of the expansion of @xmath60 in even powers of @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the time - average operation described above .",
    "following the arguments of @xcite , it is easy to show that the above series converges absolutely . note that @xmath67 enters the expansion in zeroth order , whereas @xmath49 ( @xmath68 ) contributes only to second and higher orders .",
    "when @xmath48 eq.([expgreen ] ) is an expansion in powers of @xmath69 .",
    "then , as kha neglects terms of the order of @xmath70 it is expected to give a good result if @xmath71 . since in this case @xmath72 , the dressed potential",
    "can also be considered an small perturbation partially breaking the degeneracy of landau levels .",
    "it is important to realize that the limit @xmath73 can be achieved not only by increasing the laser intensity ( @xmath74 ) but also by approaching the cyclotronic frequency ( @xmath75 ) .    in what follows",
    ", we will consider a particular potential : @xmath76 for which the expressions of @xmath42 have the simple form @xmath77\\ ] ] in this case , magnetic subbands collapse when @xmath4 is a zero of @xmath5 , and processes involving absorption or emission of n photons are quenched at zeros of @xmath7 .",
    "however , for an arbitrary superlattice , @xmath42 is given by eqs.([gral ] ) and different harmonics are modified in different proportions , so @xmath42 does not necessarily become zero for finite values of @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath78 ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath79 is fixed , @xmath49 approaches zero as @xmath80 and magnetic subbands are supressed . in this",
    "limit multiphoton processes of many orders have a contribution of similar magnitude to the absorption and emission probabilities .    to order @xmath81 the quasienergies are given by the expression @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are laguerre polynomials .",
    "numerical diagonalization of @xmath63 gives the electron quasienergies @xmath85 in the kha , shown in fig.1 ( solid lines ) for @xmath86 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 , @xmath55 and @xmath87 , corresponding to laser intensities lower than @xmath88 at frequencies @xmath89 .",
    "we have also shown the quasienergies obtained from eq.([perturb])(dashed lines ) .      1 .   in the absence of radiation ( @xmath90 ) all magnetic subbands",
    "are dispersive , in agreement with @xcite , since for the values of @xmath10 and @xmath1 considered @xmath91 .",
    "2 .   as @xmath4 increases , the magnetic subbands become flat .",
    "3 .   as @xmath4 increases , the results derived from eq.([perturb ] ) approach those calculated in kha approximation .",
    "4 .   the facts described in b. and c. do not occur monotonously , because of the oscillations of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , these effects are stronger for @xmath92 than for @xmath93 because @xmath5 has a zero in @xmath94",
    "one must expect the same qualitative behaviour for any superlattice , but in the general case there are no finite values of @xmath4 for which magnetic subbands collapse . note that in this case @xmath95    in fig.2 we show the density of electron states ( dos ) calculated from eq.([perturb ] ) for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "when magnetic subbands become flat , the time averaged velocity in the @xmath25 direction is zero and electron motion becomes one - dimensional , as can be seen in the shape of the dos curve for @xmath92 . under these conditions , tunneling in the direction of growth",
    "is expected to be quenched , as for bloch minibands .",
