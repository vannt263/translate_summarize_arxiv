    "the average metal content of a galaxy correlates with its mass .",
    "more massive galaxies are more metal - rich than less massive galaxies .",
    "the relation can be explained by the retention of metals in the galaxies gravitational potential wells ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "high - mass galaxies have deep potential wells that can resist some of the expulsion of gas and metals by supernova winds , stellar winds , and galaxy - scale feedback .",
    "low - mass galaxies lack the gravity to resist these feedback mechanisms .",
    "the correlation between metallicity and mass can also be explained by a correlation between star formation efficiency and stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". if massive galaxies evolve quickly , then they can achieve high stellar masses and low gas mass fractions .",
    "consequently , their metallicities will be high .",
    "on the other hand , slowly evolving , low - mass galaxies can have high gas fractions , which dilute the metallicity of both the gas and the stars that form from the gas .",
    "yet another explanation for the mass  metallicity relation is a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) that changes with the rate of star formation @xcite .",
    "because that rate depends on galaxy mass and because the metal yield depends on the masses of stars , a galaxy s metallicity then depends on its stellar mass .",
    "galactic metallicity is typically measured in the gas phase .",
    "emission line diagnostics of metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) sample the metallicity of regions .",
    "hence , these measures probe presently star - forming gas . using strong line diagnostics , @xcite and @xcite established the first luminosity  metallicity relations ( lzrs ) for star - forming galaxies .",
    "@xcite  found that the effective metal yields of all of the galaxies they considered were below the true yield expected from a `` closed box '' or `` simple '' model of galactic chemical evolution @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the average metallicities of star - forming galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) correlate strongly with their stellar masses or rotation speeds .",
    "the correlation with stellar mass has an intrinsic scatter of only 0.1  dex in @xmath2 . as with previous studies , @xcite  interpreted the relation as a progression of a larger effective yield for more massive galaxies . expressed another way , more massive galaxies lose a smaller fraction of the metals that their stars produce .",
    "the mass  metallicity relation ( mzr)where metallicity was measured in the gas phase  extends down to the mass range of dwarf galaxies as small as a few million solar masses . @xcite and @xcite showed that dwarf elliptical ( de ) and dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) in and around the local group ( lg ) obey a lzr . @xcite extended the relation to more distant spiral galaxies .",
    "irregular and spiral galaxies obey the same , unbroken relation over 4.5 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "one of the sources of error in determining the mzr is the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this ratio is required to convert the lzr into the mzr .",
    "it depends on a galaxy s star formation history ( sfh ) with potential contributions from the stellar imf .",
    "@xcite measured stellar masses for dwarf galaxies based on 4.5  @xmath4 m luminosity , which is less sensitive to age , sfh , and dust than visible luminosity . while @xcite already established that the lzr applies to dwarf galaxies , @xcite showed that the mzr from more massive spiral galaxies @xcite also applies to dirrs .",
    "the mzr also exists at high redshift .",
    "@xcite found that the relation persists , but evolves in the sense that high - redshift galaxies are more metal - poor at a given stellar mass than galaxies in the local universe . @xcite",
    "and @xcite showed that the mzr evolves smoothly from @xmath5 to the present .",
    "however , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found that the independent variable controlling the offset of the mzr was star formation rate ( sfr ) , not redshift .",
    "because sfr increases with redshift @xcite , it appeared as though the mzr was evolving , but it is in fact constant after the correction for sfr .",
    "correcting for sfr leads to the unevolving `` fundamental metallicity relation . ''",
    "star formation depresses the gas - phase metallicity of a galaxy because star formation requires hydrogen gas .",
    "metallicity is expressed as the ratio of metals to hydrogen .",
    "therefore , vigorously star forming galaxies contain a lot of hydrogen , which dilutes the metals .",
    "in fact , @xcite established that the offset in the mzr correlates better with gas mass than sfr .",
    "the majority of stellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that are not forming stars and have very little gas @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to place them on the same fundamental metallicity relation corrected for sfr or gas mass .",
    "instead , it is necessary to construct a separate mzr that measures stellar metallicity rather than gas - phase metallicity .",
    "emission line diagnostics of metallicity apply only to star - forming galaxies .",
    "they sample the present metallicity of stars forming at the time of observation .",
    "a complementary technique for measuring the composition of a galaxy is to measure stellar metallicities from stellar colors or spectral absorption lines .",
    "@xcite first noticed a correlation between galaxies @xmath6 colors and their absolute magnitudes .",
    "he suggested that the cause of the correlation was a variable ratio of population  i ( young , metal - rich ) to population  ii ( old , metal - poor ) stars .",
    "in essence , he first suggested the idea of a lzr .",
    "later , @xcite showed that the color ",
    "magnitude relation applies to both virgo cluster galaxies and field galaxies .",
    "the stellar metallicity of a galaxy is a record of the past star formation .",
    "each star preserves the metallicity of the galactic gas at the time and site of formation .",
    "a stellar metallicity distribution function is therefore a chronicle of the chemical evolution of the galaxy . in the typical mode of a monotonic increase of gas metallicity with time , the gas - phase metallicity is greater than the average stellar metallicity",
    ". furthermore , the gas - phase metallicity in principle fluctuates more than the stellar metallicity .",
    "the gas metallicity changes as rapidly as gas flows into and out of the galaxy , whereas the stellar metallicity responds to gas flows on a longer timescale , which depends on the sfr . on the other hand , @xcite showed that the dispersion in the mzr is just 0.15  dex when the `` direct '' method is used to measure gas - phase abundances from auroral lines .",
    "furthermore , rare outliers from the mzr when using the strong nebular lines are not outliers when using the more trusted , direct method .",
    "the low dispersion leaves little room for large fluctuations in the gas - phase metallicity .",
    "however , the direct method is only practical for a limited range of galaxies because the [ ]  @xmath74363 emission line is intrinsically faint , especially at high metallicities ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "quiescent and gas - free galaxies have no emission lines .",
    "the only light from these galaxies comes from stars .",
    "hence , spectroscopic metallicities must be measured from absorption lines rather than emission lines . in practice ,",
    "models of the integrated light spectrum from an entire stellar population @xcite are compared to observed galaxy spectra .",
    "one implementation of this technique is to measure spectrophotometric indices , such as lick indices @xcite .",
    "@xcite updated the use of line indices to rely on spectral models rather than fixed - resolution templates .",
    "this method can even be used with ultraviolet line indices for high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "spectral models can even be compared directly to observed spectra without compressing the abundance information into a few line indices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite applied the @xcite  models to sdss spectra of over 40,000 galaxies .",
    "they showed that the average stellar metallicities of galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath9 correlate tightly with stellar mass .",
    "the correlation has the same shape as the correlation between gas - phase metallicity and stellar mass for sdss galaxies found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that early - type galaxies stellar metallicities correlate better with their dynamical masses than their stellar masses .",
    "the correlation with dynamical mass lends credence to the theory that galaxies with shallower potential wells are more susceptible to metal loss .    on the other hand , dark matter halo masses for dwarf galaxies ( @xmath10 )",
    "may not correlate at all with their stellar masses or metallicities @xcite .",
    "however , the full dark matter potential is difficult to measure in any galaxy . while it is straightforward to constrain the mass within the half - light radius @xcite , it is nearly impossible to measure the total gravitational potentials of most dispersion - supported galaxies in the absence of an extended tracer @xcite .",
    "the baryons are so deeply embedded in the dark matter halo that any connection to halo virial mass requires a theoretical extrapolation .",
    "gas - phase abundances are usually expressed in terms of oxygen abundance .",
    "oxygen absorption lines in stars are few and weak .",
    "the spectral features most readily available in stars are from iron and magnesium .",
    "therefore , comparing gas - phase to stellar metallicities requires the assumption of abundance ratios , such as [ o / fe ] .",
    "this ratio depends on the sfh .",
    "another option to compare gas - phase abundances in star - forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies is to measure oxygen abundances of planetary nebulae ( pne ) , which are the long - lived remnants of dead stars . @xcite",
    "measured the oxygen abundances of pne in both dirrs and dwarf elliptical / spheroidal galaxies ( des / dsphs ) .",
    "they found that the de / dsph lzr was offset from dirrs in the sense that pne in des and dsphs are more oxygen - rich than in dirrs of similar luminosity .",
    "there is some question about whether oxygen abundances in pne trace the oxygen abundances of stars .",
    "@xcite laid out the reasons for possible discrepancies , but did not find them to apply to the pne in dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite revisited the offset , and they showed that it applies whether the oxygen abundances in dirrs are measured from pne or regions .",
    "one possibility is that the pne themselves produce oxygen in the third dredge - up , while they are expelling their envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that pne and regions could preferentially trace a younger , more metal - rich population than the average .    ]",
    "nearby galaxies can be resolved into individual regions and individual stars . whereas integrated light spectra do not allow a measurement of the spread of metallicity within a galaxy , spectroscopy of individual stars",
    "resolves the shapes of metallicity distributions .",
    "individual stellar metallicities can be measured from color  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "@xcite compiled average metallicities of lg dwarf galaxies .",
    "the metallicities were measured spectroscopically for the nearer dsph galaxies and from the optical colors of the red giant branch ( rgb ) for the more distant dirr galaxies . in agreement with the oxygen measurements from pne",
    ", @xcite found an offset in the lzr such that dirrs are more iron - poor at fixed luminosity than dsphs ( see figure  [ fig : gre03 ] ) .",
    "however , the colors of red giants are subject to the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a stellar population ages , the rgb becomes redder .",
    "however , more metal - rich red giants are also redder .",
    "thus , the age of the population needs to be determined before the rgb color can be used to measure metallicity . determining the age is especially important for a comparison between dsphs and dirrs because the stellar populations of dsphs are systematically older than dirrs .",
    "@xcite reported in conference proceedings that they re - analyzed the metallicities of dirrs from rgb colors , and they found iron metallicities on average 0.5  dex higher than @xcite for the same galaxies .",
    "the difference in the analyses arose from a different treatment in the ages of the stellar populations as well as accounting for a spread in age and metallicity .",
    "the offset between dirrs and dsphs in the lzr vanished in the more recent study .",
    "when it is possible to observe stars spectroscopically , spectroscopic metallicities are preferred to photometric metallicities because the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy applies only in subtle ways to stellar spectra .",
    "@xcite first measured the spectroscopic metallicities for extragalactic stars .",
    "they based their measurements of the carina dsph on the strength of the near - infrared triplet ( cat ) , which they calibrated to galactic globular clusters of known metallicity .",
    "since then , the cat technique has been used to quantify the metallicity distributions of most of the classical dsph milky way ( mw ) satellites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and two dirrs : ngc  6822 @xcite and wlm at a distance of 930  kpc @xcite . using a technique not based on empirical calibrations , @xcite quantified the metallicity distributions of 15 mw dsphs using synthetic spectral fitting to iron lines in individual red giants .",
    "they found a single , power - law relation between metallicity and galaxy luminosity over the range @xmath11 .",
    "this relation for dsphs is consistent with the mzr determined from photometric metallicities of stars in more massive des @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we extend our spectroscopic analysis of iron lines in red giants to gas - rich dirrs .",
    "we aim to resolve the ambiguity of the photometric metallicity measurements in dirrs .",
    "we construct a unified stellar mass  stellar metallicity relation for lg dwarf galaxies of various morphologies , ages , and gas fractions .",
    "this relation spans six orders of magnitude in luminosity or stellar mass .",
    "we further connect this relation to the stellar mass  stellar metallicity relation of more massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "we discuss the origin of the universal mzr in the context of metal loss",
    ". finally , we present the shapes of the metallicity distributions and discuss the role of gas inflow , outflow , and ram pressure stripping .",

    "figure  [ fig : coadd ] shows an example of the four coadded spectra in the m31 satellite andromeda  v.    the rest of our procedure followed @xcite .",

    "the metallicities of the coadded spectra show no systematic difference with the central photometric metallicity of the bin .",
    "the rms between the spectral and photometric metallicities is about 0.2  dex for any particular m31 satellite .",
    "even so , the coadded , spectroscopic metallicities should be regarded as more accurate because they do not suffer from the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy .",
    "although the stars were grouped according to @xmath80}}_{\\rm phot}$ ] , that value does not enter into the determination of the spectroscopic metallicity .",
    "the metallicity determination relies on the photometric temperatures and gravities of the stars , but those values are much less sensitive to age than @xmath80}}_{\\rm phot}$ ] is .",
    "certain aspects of our experimental design could bias our metallicity distributions against metal - rich or metal - poor stars .",
    "although we performed almost no selection on color within the reasonable bounds of the rgb , the photometric catalogs have a color bias for the faintest stars .",
    "for example , the photometry for ngc  6822 has a magnitude limit of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "stars fainter than these limits have photometric errors greater than 0.1  dex .",
    "the dashed , gray line in figure  [ fig : n6822 ] shows the @xmath88 limit , which is more restrictive than the @xmath89 limit for rgb colors .",
    "the magnitude limit imposes a slight color bias against red stars for the faintest stars in our ngc  6822 sample .",
    "this bias is very small because many stars fainter than the 0.1  dex error limit are still included in our sample .",
    "furthermore , the excluded portion of the rgb  had we been able to include it  would have comprised less than 5% of our spectroscopic sample .",
    "we deem this bias as negligible .",
    "there is also a bias in the sense that galaxies have radial metallicity gradients ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when a galaxy has a metallicity gradient , it is almost always in the sense that the innermost stars are more metal - rich than the outermost stars .",
    "our sample could have a bias against the outer , metal - poor stars because most of our slitmasks were placed at the centers of their respective galaxies .",
    "this bias is especially applicable to the dsphs , which are closer than the dirrs and therefore have larger angular sizes .",
    "fortunately , most of the stars in both dirrs and dsphs are concentrated toward their centers .",
    "our slitmasks span at least the half - light radii for all galaxies in our sample except sextans .",
    "therefore , our samples represent at least half of the stellar populations  and typically much more than half  in all of the galaxies except for sextans , which has a radial metallicity gradient of 0.35  dex  kpc@xmath62 @xcite . if the gradients that @xcite and @xcite measured persist out the tidal radii , then the typical bias in @xmath90}}\\rangle$ ] caused by the central concentration of our spectroscopic sample is @xmath91  dex .",
    "some galaxies also show a correlation between metallicity and velocity dispersion of distinct kinematic populations @xcite .",
    "usually , the more metal - poor population is dynamically hotter .",
    "applying a membership cut in velocity space could bias the sample against metal - poor stars . however , our @xmath69 velocity cut is quite inclusive .",
    "if the velocities are normally distributed among a single population , then our velocity criterion includes 99.7% of member stars .",
    "although fornax , sculptor , and sextans do not have single kinematic populations , our velocity criterion includes 98.4% , 99.0% , and 96.9% , respectively , of possible members within @xmath92 of @xmath67 .",
    "the sextans spectroscopic sample is expected to be more contaminated with non - members than the other two dsphs because it has the lowest galactic latitude . even if all of the discarded stars belonged to sextans , the bias against metal - poor stars is at most 3.1% .",
    "we conclude that selection biases do not significantly affect the average metallicities discussed in section  [ sec : mzr ]",
    ". however , selection biases could subtly affect the metallicity distributions ( section  [ sec : gce ] ) .",
    "our sample might be missing some of the rare , extremely metal - poor stars that preferentially inhabit the dwarf galaxies outskirts .",
    "it is also these stars that would be lost first in tidal stripping as the dsphs fell into the mw .",
    "this bias is difficult to quantify because it depends on the dsph orbits and the shape of the radial metallicity gradient out to the tidal radii , both of which are unknown or poorly known for most dwarf galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , this bias affects only the detailed shape of the metal - poor part of the metallicity distributions , not average metallicities or the bulk of the metallicity distributions .",

    "they are far from large galaxies with gas halos that could strip them . on the other hand",
    ", the low - luminosity dsphs do orbit the mw at distances small enough to encounter ram pressure stripping . the fact that their mdfs show no evidence for stripping may indicate that they finished their star formation before they fell into the mw .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the exclusively ancient populations in sextans @xcite , ursa minor @xcite , draco @xcite , and canes venatici  i @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "fornax @xcite and leo  i @xcite had sfhs easily extended enough to be affected by ram pressure stripping . while ram pressure stripping likely ended star formation in fornax and leo  i , something else ended star formation in the less luminous dsphs .",
    "suspects are reionization  as long as it happened gradually enough to fail to produce a metal - rich cut - off in the mdf  and supernova feedback .",
    "we note that @xcite and @xcite found no evidence for the effects of reionization on the sfhs of isolated dwarf galaxies .",
    "the differently shaped mdfs between dsphs and dirrs pose a problem for the theory that dirrs transform into dsphs @xcite unless tidal stripping removed many metal - poor stars from dsphs as they fell into the mw ( see section  [ sec : bias ] ) .",
    "most of the dsphs have mdfs that seem to require gas accretion . even incorporating an environmental effect , like ram pressure stripping ,",

    "even the dirrs that prefer the accretion model have only a slight preference ( comparatively small values of @xmath451 ) .",
    "additionally , ngc  6822 has a low accretion parameter of @xmath494 .",
    "the accretion parameters for the dsphs that prefer the accretion model range from @xmath495 ( leo  ii ) to @xmath496 ( ursa minor ) . in other words ,",
    "the dsph mdfs are not consistent with transforming the dirr mdfs via removal of gas associated with falling into the mw .",
    "we have presented a limited set of chemical evolution models .",
    "it is possible that the accretion model fits the mdfs deceptively well .",
    "the physical interpretation of the model is not necessarily the truth of the galaxy s history just because it fits the mdf .",
    "more complex models may better reflect the dsphs sfh .",
    "for example , fornax experienced multiple discrete episodes of star formation rather than one smoothly varying sfr @xcite .",
    "a proper chemical evolution model should incorporate multiple episodes of star formation , the accompanying expulsion of gas , and the possible subsequent re - accretion of gas ( e.g. , see the chemical evolution models of @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that galaxies as large as fornax were not completely ram pressure stripped on their first pericentric approach to the mw .",
    "after all , simulations of tidal stirring ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require multiple pericentric passages to complete the transformation of a dirr into a dsph .",
    "it may be appropriate to add complexity to our ram pressure stripping model to account for multiple pericentric passages .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we measured metallicities from spectra of individual red giants in 15  mw dsphs and seven lg dirrs as well as from coadded spectra of red giants in 13  m31 dsphs .",
    "in contrast to metallicities measured from emission lines , our stellar metallicities were not affected by the instantaneous gas fraction in the galaxies .",
    "instead , they are a chronicle of the galaxies past star formation . unlike integrated light spectroscopy , resolving individual stars also allowed us to explore the chemical evolution of an individual galaxy .",
    "our measurements were based exclusively on lines .",
    "this technique avoided some of the uncertainties associated with the empirical calibration of cat equivalent width and lick indices .",
    "while these methods are sensitive to [ ca / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] , respectively , our method provides a direct measurement of iron abundance .",
    "the stellar mass  stellar metallicity relation is roughly continuous from the smallest galaxies ( @xmath497 ) to the largest galaxies ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the mzr measured from the galaxies in our sample ( @xmath498 ) is @xmath0 .",
    "the slope of the mzr for sdss galaxies in the mass range @xmath499 @xcite is slightly steeper than for the dwarf galaxies , but the comparison is approximate because the techniques used to measure metallicities in the two stellar mass ranges were different .",
    "the mzr can be understood in the context of gas and metal flows .",
    "galaxies in less massive halos expel a larger fraction of their gas because they lack the gravity to resist galactic winds .",
    "the lost gas carries away metals that the stellar population produced . without those metals ,",
    "the subsequent generations of stars are born more metal - poor than they would have been in a more massive galaxy .",
    "the relationship between gravitational potential and metal retention is especially apparent in the massive sdss galaxies .",
    "the stellar metallicities in the sdss galaxies follow a tighter relation with potential well depth ( dynamical mass ) than stellar mass @xcite .",
    "an alternative interpretation of the mzr is variable star formation efficiency .",
    "low mass galaxies have high gas mass fractions @xcite .",
    "their gas dilutes the metals created by the stellar population .",
    "consequently , the metallicity of the gas remains low , and the stars that form from the gas are correspondingly metal - poor .",
    "however , this explanation does not quite fit the gas fractions and gas - phase metallicities of all galaxies . in section  [ sec : mzr ] , we showed that our measurement of ngc  6822 s stellar metallicity implies that 95% of the iron created by the stellar population is missing from the stars .",
    "if the galaxy has not lost mass , then this iron must be hiding in the gas .",
    "although gas - phase iron abundances are not available , gas - phase oxygen abundance measurements combined with the amount of missing iron imply an [ o / fe ] ratio six times less than that observed in stars .",
    "we conclude that it is more likely that ngc  6822 is losing metals rather than harboring them in its gas .",
    "dirrs follow the same mzr as dsphs .",
    "photometric metallicities previously indicated that the dirrs are more metal - poor that dsphs at fixed luminosity @xcite .",
    "however , photometric metallicities require a knowledge of the ages of stars .",
    "the younger ages of dirrs compared to dsphs result in bluer red giants , which could be interpreted as more metal - poor .",
    "our spectroscopic metallicities circumvented the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy , and we found no significant difference in the average metallicities of dsphs and dirrs at fixed luminosity or stellar mass .    despite the mzr s uniformity without regard to galaxy type , the metallicity distributions of dsphs are different from dirrs .",
    "the dsphs have narrow , peaked distributions compared to dirrs .",
    "all of the dwarf galaxies have a tail of metal - poor stars , but this tail blends more smoothly with the metal - rich stars for dirrs than for dsphs .",
    "the mdfs of the four most luminous dsphs in our sample have sharp cut - offs at high metallicity .",
    "the shapes of the dirrs mdfs resemble a leaky box model of chemical evolution . allowing for gas accretion improved the fit to the mdfs of a couple dirrs , like ngc  6822 , but the amount of accretion required was small . on the other hand",
    ", most of the dsphs required a great deal of gas accretion during their star formation lifetimes to explain the shapes of their mdfs .",
    "however , the chemical evolution models are simplistic .",
    "most importantly , they assume the instantaneous recycling approximation , which is not strictly applicable to our iron abundance measurements .",
    "the ideal model will both relax this approximation and be set in a cosmological context . in the meantime , our interpretation of our model fits should be regarded as consistent with the data but not a unique description .",
    "the mdfs of the four most luminous dsphs in our sample show a sharp cut - off at high metallicity .",
    "the cut - off is nearly perfectly sharp after accounting for observational uncertainty .",
    "the less luminous dsphs and the dirrs do not show a cut - off .",
    "the metallicity wall may be environmental .",
    "the luminous dsphs could still have been forming stars when they fell into the hot gas corona of the mw .",
    "the removal of gas due to tidal or ram pressure stripping would have ended star formation rapidly , leading to a sudden end to chemical evolution .",
    "conversely , the less luminous galaxies may have ended their star formation due to reionization or internal mechanisms before they fell into the mw . as a result ,",
    "their mdfs do not show a rapid cessation in their chemical evolution .",
    "the dirrs have no metal - rich cut - off because they are all too far from the mw or m31 to have experienced ram pressure stripping .",
    "although tidal and ram pressure stripping are likely mechanisms for metal loss , they do not shape the mzr .",
    "ram pressure stripping freezes a galaxy s chemical evolution at the moment of infall , and stripped galaxies still obey the mzr .",
    "therefore , galaxies obey the mzr throughout their lives .    despite widely varying sfhs , gas flow histories , and environments ,",
    "most galaxies in the universe adhere closely to the universal stellar mass  stellar metallicity relation .",
    "dsphs and dirrs seem to be shaped by environmental effects .",
    "for example , they have very different gas fractions @xcite , and even their metallicity distributions are shaped differently .",
    "nonetheless , nearly all dwarf galaxies obey the same mzr .",
    "the relation indicates an inextricable connection between the acquisition of stellar mass and the retention of metals .",
    "the processes that eject metals also expel gas that can no longer be used to form stars .",
    "these processes can be supernova feedback , stellar winds , or ram pressure stripping .",
    "although the details of metal and gas loss leave separate imprints on metallicity distributions , they all preserve the universal stellar mass  stellar metallicity relation .",
