    "the standard model ( sm ) constitutes three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "nobody knows any deep reason for the number of generation to be equal three .",
    "there are no theoretical arguments against addition of extra sequential generations into sm .",
    "so it would be interesting to understand whether such generations are allowed by existing experimental data .",
    "the direct experimental searches have found no trace of any extra quarks or leptons .",
    "the lower bounds on the masses of unobserved generations are collected in the pdg tables @xcite .",
    "the value of the bounds are of the order of 100 gev - they are fixed by the energy of the acting accelerators .",
    "there is also indirect way to study new generations with arbitrary heavy masses . to do that one has to study radiative corrections and compare theoretical predictions with precision experimental data @xcite - @xcite .",
    "indeed new particles are produced as the virtual states in the propagation of the gauge bosons .",
    "these new loop corrections into self - energies of propagators ( `` oblique '' corrections ) slightly change the predictions of the sm for low - energy physical observables .",
    "if the accuracy of the experimental data is better than the value of these new corrections one can exclude or discover new generations comparing theoretical predictions with precision measurements .",
    "consider this possibility in more details .",
    "all set of nearly 20 observables needs special consideration . ] that have been measured at lep i , slac , tevatron and in @xmath2 experiments ( including the axial coupling @xmath3 , the ratio @xmath4 , and the ratio @xmath5 ) in the framework of the sm can be determined in terms of three functions @xmath6(i = a , r , m ) @xcite : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9    the contribution of the new generations modifies the sm value of the function @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "it is important that interaction of gauge bosons with new particles is universal , i.e. the gauge coupling constants are the same for any generations .",
    "so the loop corrections to the gauge boson propagators ca nt be made arbitrary small , they are unambiguously fixed by gauge couplings and by the masses of virtual particles .",
    "the second important observation is that the matter in the sm is the chiral one , i.e. left - handed leptons and quarks belong to @xmath12 doublets while their right - handed companions are @xmath12 singlets . in this case",
    "heavy flavors do not decouple from the low - energy physics even for very large masses , i.e. radiative corrections remain finite when the masses of virtual particles go to infinity .    for example in the case of one extra generation @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 with fully degenerate doublets ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath20 ) one obtains `` finite '' corrections : @xmath21    in the opposite case when @xmath12 is strongly violated ( @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) all corrections @xmath11 are enhanced by the ratio of mass : @xmath24    thus extra heavy generations can be excluded if these additional contributions @xmath11 exceed the discrepancy between the sm fit and precision experimental data or can be `` discovered '' if they improve the fit .    in this way it was found @xcite - @xcite that the existence of extra chiral generations with all fermions heavier than @xmath25 is strongly disfavored by the precision electroweak data ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the message of this talk is that there is a small region in the parameter space where new generations could still exist .",
    "namely electroweak data are fitted nicely even by a few extra generations , if one allows neutral leptons to have masses close to @xmath26 gev @xcite ( see section 3 ) .",
    "such neutrinos are still allowed by existing experimental data . in section 4",
    "we will consider the ways to detect heavy @xmath26 gev neutrinos .    during the discussions at this conference",
    "it was noted by valery khoze @xcite that if heavy neutrinos do exist the decay rate of the standard model higgs boson into the pair of heavy neutrino would be about two order of magnitude higher than into @xmath27 , i.e. the predominant decay mode of higgs boson would be invisible .",
    "we compare theoretical predictions for extra generations with experimental data @xcite with the help of the code leptop @xcite .",
    "in what follows we will assume that the mixing of the new generations with the three old ones is small .",
    "thus new fermions contribute only into oblique corrections ( vector boson self energies ) .",
    "heavy neutrinos need special consideration .",
    "there are two ways to make neutrino massive .",
    "one can introduce right - handed neutrals @xmath17 and supply new  neutrinos \" with dirac masses analogously to the case of charged leptons and quarks .",
    "another way is to construct majorana heavy neutrino . in this paper",
    "we do not consider that possibility , our neutral lepton is a heavy dirac particle .    [",
    "tab : observables ]    .leptop fit of the precision observables .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , > \" , ]     we perform the four parameter ( @xmath28 ) fit to 18 experimental observables .",
    "the fitted parameters together with the values of the predicted observables and their pulls from the experimental data are given in the table  [ tab : observables ] .",
    "the conclusion of the fit is quite evident : * standard model fit of experimental data statistically is very good*.    there is only one cloud on the blue sky - the experimental value of the forward - backward asymmetry in the z decay into the pair of b - quarks @xmath29 shows a hint for disagreement with standard model . has to be improved in the nearest future . for value @xmath30 from ref.@xcite leptop fit gives slightly higher prediction for the higgs mass @xmath31 gev , @xmath32 gev , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . ]",
    "now we compare theoretical predictions for the case of the presence of extra generations .",
    "the procedure is the following :    first we take @xmath36 gev  the lowest value allowed for the new quark mass from tevatron search @xcite and take @xmath37 . as for the leptons from the extra generations , their masses are independent parameters . to simplify the analyzes we start with @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "any value of higgs mass above @xmath40 is allowed in our fits , however @xmath41 appears to be minimal for @xmath42 gev .     and the mass difference in the extra generations @xmath43 . the lowest allowed value @xmath44 gev from tevatron search was used and @xmath45 , @xmath46 was assumed.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in figure [ fig:1 ] the excluded domains in coordinates ( @xmath47 , @xmath43 ) are shown ( here @xmath48 and the number of extra generations @xmath47 is considered as a continuous parameter ) .",
    "minimum of @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "we see that one extra generation corresponds to @xmath50 approximately .",
    "we checked that similar bounds are valid for the general choice of heavy masses of leptons and quarks .",
    "in particular we found that for @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 one extra generation is excluded at 1.5 @xmath53 level , while for @xmath54 gev and @xmath55 the limits are even stronger than in fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the conclusion of this section is the following :    * extra generations are excluded by the electroweak precision data , if all extra fermions are heavy : @xmath56*.",
    "lower bounds on charged flavors @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are approximately @xmath60 gev-@xmath61 gev .",
    "however neutral lepton @xmath62 can be considerably lighter .    from lep ii searches of the decays @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is virtual",
    "while @xmath65 is @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath68 , it follows that @xmath69 gev for the mixing angle of the 4th generation with three known generations larger than @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the quasi - stable neutral lepton @xmath62 with mixing angle less than @xmath70 is allowed even for @xmath71 gev . in this case",
    "neutrino @xmath62 escapes detection from this lepii search .",
    "the direct delphi bound from the measurement of the @xmath72-boson width is much weaker : @xmath73 gev @xcite    we consider the case when new heavy neutrino has dirac mass in the region of @xmath74 . for particles with masses of the order of @xmath74",
    "oblique corrections drastically differ from what we have for masses @xmath75 . in this case",
    "the z boson state and @xmath76 state are practically degenerate and even small mixing term can produce large change for eigenfunctions . in other words renormalization of @xmath72-boson wave function due to @xmath76 intermediate state has to be large .",
    "it happens that large wave function renormalization due to `` light '' neutrino @xmath62 and contributions from `` genuine heavy '' @xmath77 and @xmath78 to @xmath79 have opposite sign .",
    "for very narrow region of the mass we have rather good compensation .",
    "thus corrections to sm formulas @xmath11 are small and we have the kind of heavy generation conspiracy .     and the mass of the neutral heavy lepton @xmath80 .",
    "the values @xmath81 gev , @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 gev were used , scaledwidth=65.0% ]    as an example we take @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 gev and draw exclusion plot in coordinates ( @xmath87 ) , see fig.[fig:2 ] . from this plot",
    "it is clear that for the case of fourth generation with @xmath88 gev description of the data is not worse than for the standard model and that even two new generations with @xmath89 gev are allowed within @xmath90 .",
    "the conclusion of this section is the following :    * if the neutral lepton @xmath62 has mass around 50 gev the new generations are not excluded by the electroweak precision data*.",
    "the direct search of the heavy neutrino is possible in @xmath91-annihilation .",
    "as was proposed a long time ago @xcite , the cross section of @xmath91-annihilation into an invisible final state can be inferred from observation of initial state bremsstrahlung , i.e from @xmath91-annihilation into a pair of heavy neutrinos with the emission of initial state bremsstrahlung photon @xmath92 the main background is the production of the pairs of conventional neutrinos with initial state bremsstrahlung photon @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "these background neutrinos are produced in decays of real and virtual @xmath72 . in case of @xmath95 ,",
    "two mechanisms contribute , through @xmath96-channel @xmath72 boson and from @xmath97-channel exchange of @xmath98 boson .",
    "we calculated the signal and background distributions and rates @xcite using comphep @xcite computer code .",
    "( in pb ) for standard model and for the different values of @xmath80.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in fig.[fig:3 ] the distribution on  invisible \" mass @xmath99 ( invariant mass of the neutrino pair)is represented for sm background and the @xmath100 signal for @xmath101 gev and different values of @xmath62 masses , @xmath102 gev .",
    "here we applied kinematical cuts on the photon polar angle and transverse momentum , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , being the aleph selection criteria @xcite .",
    "the photon detection efficiency 74% is assumed .",
    "for highest significance of the @xmath100 signal , evaluated as @xmath105 , one should include whole interval on @xmath99 allowed kinematically , so we applied @xmath106 cut .",
    "signal significances at lep-2 at different statistics as function of the neutrino mass.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    on fig.[fig : s - mn ] the signal significances are represented as a function of @xmath80 .",
    "one can derive that only the analysis based on combined data from all four experiments both from 1997 - 1999 runs ( @xmath107 gev ) and from the final run , in total @xmath108 pb@xmath109 , can exclude at 95% cl the interval of @xmath62 mass up to @xmath110 gev .    another possibility is to search for 50 gev neutrino at the future tesla @xmath111 electron - positron linear collider .",
    "the increase in energy leads to the decrease both of the signal and the background , but it is compensated by the proposed increase of luminosity of 300 @xmath112/year @xcite .",
    "further advantage of the linear collider is the possibility to use polarized beams .",
    "this is important in suppressing the cross section of @xmath113 as this reaction goes mainly through the @xmath97-channel exchange of the @xmath98 boson .",
    "however , even without exploiting the beam polarization the advantage of tesla in the total number of events is extremely important .",
    "thus , standard model is expected to give approximately 0.3 million single photon events for @xmath114 gev while the number of 50 gev neutrino pairs would be about 4000 .",
    "although the signal over background ratio is still small ( 2.3 - 0.5% for @xmath115 gev correspondingly ) the significance of the signal is excellent , higher than 5 standard deviations for @xmath116 gev .",
    "the conclusions of this section are the following :    combined data from four lep ii experiments can exclude at @xmath117 cl neutrino with @xmath118 .",
    "future collider tesla in one year run can exclude at @xmath117 cl the whole region of @xmath80 or can discover neutrino within 5 standard deviations with @xmath116 gev .",
    "the existence of extra chiral generations with all fermions heavier than @xmath0 is disfavored by the precision electroweak data . a few extra generations with `` light '' neutral leptons , i.e. with mass @xmath119 close to 50 gev",
    ", are not excluded yet by existing data .",
    "such heavy neutrino can be searched in the reaction @xmath120 .",
    "after this talk valera khoze made simple and important observation , that @xmath26 gev neutrino makes standard model higgs boson invisible , that require a special strategy for its search @xcite .",
