    "when a falling jet of fluid strikes a horizontal fluid layer , several flow regimes may arise .",
    "the most distinctive phenomenon , the hydraulic jump , arises above a critical flow rate , and consists of a large - amplitude increase in fluid depth at a critical distance from the site of jet impact ( figure [ bumppicture ] a ) .",
    "the circular hydraulic jump was first reported by blanger @xcite and rayleigh @xcite , and subsequently studied theoretically and experimentally by a number of investigators ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ bohr _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and watanabe _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite distinguished between circular hydraulic jumps of type i and ii .",
    "the type i jump ( see figures [ bumppicture ] a , d ) exhibits a single toroidal vortex downstream of the jump , henceforth  primary vortex \" . as the outer depth",
    "is increased progressively , a separation of this vortex @xcite is observed , giving rise to a surface roller , henceforth  secondary vortex \" and a type ii jump ( figure [ bumppicture]e , f ) .",
    "@xcite presented a numerical investigation of the link between this vortex dynamics and the underlying pressure distribution in the type ii jumps and remarked upon the importance of surface tension in the transition from type i to ii .",
    "the type ii jumps are further classified @xcite according to whether there is a substantial change in surface elevation downstream of the jump : if not , the jump is referred to as type iia ( figure [ bumppicture ] b and e ) ; if so , type iib ( figure [ bumppicture ] c and f ) .",
    "_ @xcite and bush _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also reported the emergence of double jump structures in certain parameters regimes , wherein the free surface is marked by two discrete changes in depth .",
    "+ remarkably , in certain parameter regimes , the circular hydraulic jump becomes unstable to polygons ( figure [ bumppicture]b ) , a phenomenon first reported by ellegaard @xcite , and subsequently examined by bohr and coworkers @xcite and bush _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite noted that the polygonal jumps arise exclusively with type ii jumps , that is , when both primary and secondary vortices are present .",
    "@xcite highlighted the importance of surface tension in the polygonal instability of such jumps , suggesting that a modified rayleigh - plateau - like instability might be responsible . by considering a balance between the viscous stresses associated with the secondary vortex and the hydrostatic and curvature pressure , martens _",
    "@xcite developed a theoretical model for the jump shape that yields polygons similar to those observed experimentally .",
    "when surface tension dominates , they demonstrate that the wavelength of the instability is consistent with that of rayleigh - plateau .",
    "nevertheless , they did not consider the potentially destabilizing influence of the pressure induced by the secondary roller vortex .",
    "+ plateau@xcite examined the capillary pinch - off of a fluid jet into droplets , a theoretical description of which was provided by rayleigh @xcite .",
    "this rayleigh - plateau instability was extended to the case of a rotating fluid jet by several investigators,@xcite who demonstrated that the destabilizing influence of surface tension is enhanced by fluid inertia .",
    "while vortex rings were initially thought to be indestructible @xcite , subsequent experimental , theoretical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies indicate that they are unstable to azimuthal wavelength disturbances at high reynolds numbers , resulting in polygonal forms .",
    "we here explore the possible relevance of a such instabilities to the stability of the hydraulic jump and bump .",
    "+ bush _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite briefly mentioned the emergence of polygonal forms in the absence of hydraulic jumps , when a jet plunges into a relatively deep fluid .",
    "_ @xcite recently reported that a heated toroidal fluid puddle bound in a circular channel and levitated via the leidenfrost effect is also susceptible to polygonal instabilities .",
    "the axial symmetry breaking only arises in the presence of poloidal convection within the torus , again suggesting the importance of the vortical motion on the mechanism of instability .",
    "+ we here report a phenomenon that occurs well below the hydraulic jump threshold , when the free surface is only weakly perturbed by the plunging jet .",
    "when the fluid layer is sufficiently deep , a small - amplitude circular deflection arises at the free surface , a phenomenon that we christen the hydraulic bump ( figure  [ bumppicture ] g ) .",
    "as is the case for the hydraulic jump , as the incoming flux increases , the bump radius expands until a breaking of axial symmetry results in polygonal forms ( figure  [ bumppicture ] h ) . in ",
    "ii , we report the results of our experimental investigation , and describe the flows observed .",
    "we rationalize the radius of the bump via simple scaling laws .",
    "finally , in  iii we explore the connection between the polygonal instabilities on the hydraulic bump and their counterparts on the hydraulic jump .",
    "the experimental apparatus is shown in figure  [ experiment ] . a glycerine - water solution with density @xmath0 , kinematic viscosity @xmath1 , and",
    "a surface tension @xmath2 is pumped from the tank through a flow meter and a source nozzle of radius @xmath3 mm .",
    "the resulting jet has a flux @xmath4 and a radius at impact @xmath5 that differs from @xmath6 , and varies weakly with flow rate and height in a manner detailed by bush and aristoff @xcite .",
    "the jet impacts the center of a flat plate of radius @xmath7 cm surrounded by an outer wall whose height can be adjusted in order to control the outer fluid depth @xmath8 .",
    "radial gradations on the base plate indicate @xmath9 cm increments .",
    "special care is taken to level the plate by adjusting its three supports and measuring the level along two perpendicular directions .",
    "the plate is horizontal to within @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the flow structure is extremely sensitive to the levelling of the plate ; indeed , an inclination of @xmath11 completely destroys the polygonal bump and jump forms .",
    "+ the working fluid is a glycerine - water solution with viscosity ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 cs . during the course of the experiments ,",
    "water was added to compensate for evaporative losses . for the fluids considered ,",
    "surface tension is roughly constant and equal to @xmath14 mn.m@xmath15 .",
    "the average depth is determined by measuring the volume @xmath16 above the impact plate , which is known with a precision @xmath17 ml .",
    "typically , @xmath18 ml and @xmath19 mm , so the error in depth @xmath20 mm , is sufficient for our experiments and smaller than would arise from a direct measurement .",
    "we visualize the flow structure by injecting submillimetric bubbles into the jet inlet with a syringe and taking photos that yield streak images of the bubble circulation . in passing through the pump and the flowmeter ,",
    "these bubbles are generally fractured into microbubbles that do not appreciably perturb the flow .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the bump radius , @xmath22 its height and @xmath23 the height just upstream of the bump .",
    "we denote the fluid velocity by @xmath24 and its speed by @xmath25 .",
    "this suggests the introduction of the reynolds number @xmath26 , with the jet speed @xmath27 being evaluated at the nozzle output , and a local weber number @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being the radius of the jump or the bump .",
    "+            figure [ medium ] illustrates the evolution of the flow generated by a plunging jet as the flux increases and the fluid depth @xmath8 is held constant .",
    "we note that the flux of the impacting jet is not sufficiently high to entrain air @xcite .",
    "initially ( figure  [ medium]a ) , the plunging jet induces a slight circular deflection , perceptible only from an oblique angle , and the subsurface flow is predominantly radial . at a critical flow rate ,",
    "a recirculation eddy emerges , and with it the hydraulic bump ( figure [ medium]b ) .",
    "we note that this subsurface recirculation eddy , or primary vortex , is accompanied by a small corotating secondary vortex with a surface signature that corresponds to the bump . as the flux increases , the bump increases in both amplitude and radius . at a critical flux ,",
    "azimuthal instabilities develop along its perimeter ( figure [ medium]c ) , giving rise to a stable polygonal bump ( figure [ medium]d ) .",
    "as the bump has a very modest surface signature , much less than the jump , we infer that the subsurface vortical structure is critical in its instability .",
    "+ the height and radius of the circular bump are readily rationalized via scaling arguments .",
    "we consider a point @xmath30 at the surface near the plunging jet and a point @xmath31 on the bump ( see figure [ medium]b ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the amplitude of the bump .",
    "since b can be considered as a stagnation point and since curvature pressures are expected to be negligible with respect to the hydrostatic pressure within the bump , bernoulli s theorem dictates that @xmath32 , so we expect that @xmath33 with @xmath34 . figure [ scale]a illustrates the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath36 over the parameter range in which circular bumps arise .",
    "this simple scaling is roughly validated , and a proportionality constant of @xmath37 is indicated .    figure",
    "[ scale]b illustrates the dependence of the bump radius @xmath21 on the flux @xmath4 and the kinematic viscosity @xmath1 of the fluid over the range of weber and reynolds numbers in which circular bumps emerge .",
    "the characteristic radius of the inner vortex can be deduced by considering the azimuthal component of the vorticity equation . in a steady state",
    ", the balance of convection and diffusion of vorticity @xmath38 requires that @xmath39 .",
    "the typical scale of the vertical flow is @xmath23 , the inner depth .",
    "thus , balancing @xmath40 and @xmath41 and using @xmath42 indicates that @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ scale]b lends support to this scaling argument , and suggests a proportionality coefficient of @xmath44 .             as illustrated in figure",
    "[ bumppicture]c and [ bumppicture]i , non - circular bumps may also arise downstream of polygonal hydraulic jumps .",
    "similar nested jump - bump structures have been reported by andersen _",
    "et al._@xcite and bush _ et al._@xcite .",
    "we note that the number of sides of the outer bump and inner jump polygons are not necessarily the same .",
    "figure 1i illustrates a square jump within a pentagonal bump .",
    "figure  [ diagrammephase ] indicates where the various flow structures , specifically circular and polygonal hydraulic jumps and bumps , arise in the ( @xmath45 ) plane .",
    "in addition to our new data , this regime diagram includes data from bush _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , with due care given to their different definitions of the weber and reynolds numbers . in our experiments , as @xmath4 is increased , the data necessarily traverses a path on the regime diagram along which @xmath46 .",
    "the dependence of the flow structure on viscosity was examined by progressively diluting the solution .",
    "we note that in sufficiently dilute solutions , the polygonal forms are unstable owing to the onset of turbulence .",
    "viscosity is thus critical in the suppression of turbulence , and the sustenance of stable jumps , which only arise in the moderate reynolds number range : @xmath47 .",
    "we have characterized the flows generated by a laminar fluid jet plunging into a bath of the same fluid , giving particular attention to the accompanying subsurface vortex structure and its instability .",
    "we have reported and rationalized a new interfacial structure , the circular hydraulic bump , the small surface deflection that arises prior to the onset of the hydraulic jump .",
    "the bump coincides with the stagnation point associated with the subsurface vortex generated by the plunging jet and consists of a small toroidal vortex with a surface signature .",
    "simple scaling arguments have allowed us to rationalize both the radius and amplitude of the bump .",
    "+ we have also reported that , as the flux increases , the circular bump goes unstable to a polygonal form reminiscent of that arising in the hydraulic jump @xcite .",
    "we note that the polygonal instabilities of both the jump and bump are associated with a toroidal vortex with a surface signature .",
    "since the bump has a relatively small surface signature , we expect its accompanying subsurface vorticity to provide the dominant mechanism for its instability .",
    "this surface vortex instability mechanism , and its relation to the hydraulic bump , the hydraulic jump , and the toroidal leidenfrost vortex  @xcite , will be the subject of a theoretical investigation to be reported elsewhere .",
