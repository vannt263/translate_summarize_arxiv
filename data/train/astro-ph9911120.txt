    "the origin of the x - ray emission from main sequence stars ( msss ) is currently considered to be either stellar wind shocks for massive stars ( o to b5 , e.g. lucy & white 1980 ) or magnetic activity for low mass stars ( f5 to m ) .",
    "the former is responsible to a strong stellar wind , whereas the latter is a dynamo process , which is due to coupled effects of the surface convection and the differential rotation .",
    "since intermediate mass stars have neither a strong stellar wind nor a surface convection zone , they exhibit only faint or no x - rays .",
    "essentially , the same scenario has been successfully applied to pre - main - sequence stars ( pmss ) .",
    "low mass pmss called t - tauri stars ( ttss ) and protostars have been found to be strong x - ray emitters , possibly due to the enhanced solar - like magnetic activity ( feigelson & kriss 1981 ; montmerle et al .",
    "intermediate mass of pmss are called herbig ae / be stars ( haebes ) and lack both a strong stellar wind and a surface convection layer ( e.g. palla 1999 ) .",
    "consequently , strong x - ray emission has not been predicted from herbig ae / be stars .",
    "zinnecker & preibisch ( 1994 ) , however , reported rosat x - ray detections from 11 haebes out of 21 samples , whose spectral types ranged from b0 to f5 .",
    "these facts force us to suspect a hidden low mass companion with the haebes . however , the rosat results show a correlation between x - ray luminosity ( @xmath5 ) to bolometric luminosity ( @xmath6 ) , and the observed luminosity of @xmath7 erg / s is significantly larger than those of typical low mass pmss of @xmath8 erg / s .",
    "thus , the hypothesis of a hidden low mass companion is unlikely .",
    "zinnecker & preibisch ( 1994 ) also found no correlation of @xmath5 to the stellar rotation velocity ( @xmath9 sin@xmath10 ) , but found a weak correlation with the velocity of stellar wind ( @xmath11 ) and the mass loss rate ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "these facts favor the stellar wind origin for the haebe x - rays . however , the ratio of x - rays to bolometric luminosity @xmath13 is in the range of @xmath14 , larger than those of massive msss by one to three orders .",
    "the puzzle of x - ray emissions from haebes may be related to the `` paradox '' in the ir band .",
    "bohm & catala ( 1994 ) found many similarities between ttss and haebes and speculated that very young haebes still surrounded by circumstellar accretion disks and embedded deeply in the cloud may have jets or outflows , possibly due to magnetic activity .",
    "spectral and timing studies with wide energy bands are essential to address the origin of the haebe x - rays , hence , asca observations on some selected haebes have been performed .",

    "this short time variability indicates that the x - ray emitting region is compact , hence is attributable to herbig be star mwc297 rather than an extended object sh2 - 62 . here and after ,",
    "we regard the brighter source to be mwc297 , and other remote possibilities such as uncatalogued low mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) , or hidden low mass companions are separately discussed in section [ subsec : lowmass ] .    the time variability with an exponential - decay is similar to that of a flare from low mass stars .",
    "we accordingly regard that we observed a decay phase of an x - ray flare during the second and third observations , whereas the first observation fell on a quiescent phase .",

    "the x - ray spectra of mwc297 are obtained by extracting the x - ray events from the same region as the data of the light curve , whereas the background is estimated from an annulus with 3@xmath25 inner radius and 6@xmath25 outer radius centered on mwc297 .",

    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table [ best_fit_mwc297 ] .",
    "the column density of hydrogen is consistent with a constant value during the three observations .",
    "according to the relation @xmath30 = 2.2 @xmath1 10@xmath31 @xmath16 ( ryter 1996 ; cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1988 ) , the mean @xmath30 value of @xmath0 2.4 @xmath32 0.9 @xmath1 10@xmath33 @xmath16 is converted to the visual extinction of @xmath18 10 @xmath32 4 , which is in excellent agreement with the observed value of av = 8@xmath2310 .    the plasma temperature in the quiescent phase of 2.7 kev was increased to 6.7 kev at the flare and then decreased to 3.2 kev .",
    "this would be the first detection of a flare for early - type stars , accompanied with a plasma heating in the rising phase , and cooling in the decaying phase .",
    "the flare peak , however , is missed ; we only detected x - rays after the on - set of the flare .",
    "thus , the peak luminosity should be larger than 4.9 @xmath1 10@xmath2 ergs / s , which is the maximum value found at the beginning of the second observation . then",
    ", the total energy released in the x - ray band is estimated to be more than 2.7 @xmath1 10@xmath34 ergs ( 0.4@xmath2310 kev ) .",
    "the abundances in the first and third observations are consistent with one solar , but that in the second observation is significantly lower than one solar .",
    "+      since x - ray spectra of solar - mass pmss and brighter herbig ae stars often exhibit a multi - temperature structure with a cool x - ray component , which is naturally interpreted as a quiescent coronal component for the solar mass stars , and a hard component which is responsible to a flare ( e.g. a herbig ae star , hd 104237 in skinner & yamauchi 1996 ; a classical tts , su aur in skinner & walter 1998 ) , we also tried a two - temperatures model ( two raymond - smith model ) with common absorption , although a simple one - temperature model is already acceptable with the @xmath35 test .    at first , we allowed the two temperatures and common n@xmath36 to be free parameters for each abundance set of the hotter component and cooler component .",
    "for the abundances of hotter and cooler components , we tried for three cases : ( 1 ) fixed to those of the best - fit one - temperature plasma results , and those of solar , ( 2 ) free parameters and fixed to one solar , and ( 3 ) both free parameters . however , we find no significant improvement of @xmath35 values from a one - temperature model as given in table [ 2t_fit_mwc297 ] . also , the cool component is found to contribute only a small fraction even in the soft x - ray band ( 0.4 @xmath23 2 kev ) , or conversely , the best - fit temperatures of the hotter component are essentially the same as those found in the one - temperature fittings .",
    "we should note that for only the flare spectrum in case ( 3 ) , the soft component contributes a significant fraction .",
    "however , the temperatures of hotter and cooler components are about 1 kev and 17 kev , respectively , and abundances for a cool component are found to be zero .",
    "these results are unrealistic , and are out side of an allowable range to be accepted as a two - component plasma concept for stellar plasmas .    next , we fixed the n@xmath36 value to that expected from the optical extinction ( n@xmath37 1.83 @xmath1 10@xmath33 @xmath16 ) and proceeded with two - temperature fittings . in this case , the data ( spectra ) require no soft x - ray component at all ; the best - fit normalizations of the soft components are zero .",
    "no improvement for the two - temperature model would be due to the limited photon counts ; in the flare , sis0+sis1 and gis2+gis3 counts are only @xmath181200 and @xmath18800 photons , respectively , whereas those in a quiescent state ( first observation , for example ) are @xmath18400 ( sis0+sis1 ) and @xmath18200 ( gis2+gis3 ) photons .",
    "also , the large column density of hydrogen to the source reduces most of the soft x - ray photons , hence the observed spectra become insensitive to a cool component , even if it exists .",
    "thus we conclude that the present data set have no capability to judge whether it includes a cool component or not .",
    "accordingly , we continue our discussion on the hot component , which parameters are essentially the same from both the one- and two - temperature model fittings .      since x - ray emission from an unclassified ir source , iras18245 - 0342 ( beichman et al .",
    "1988 ; david et al . 1993 ) is serendipitously discovered in the gis images , we briefly report the x - ray properties . the data are obtained from a 3@xmath25 radius circle , and the background is taken from a source free region .",
    "x - rays are found in the second and third observations , and the spectra are separately shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra_s2 ] . since the flare epoch of iras18245 - 0342 coincides with that of mwc297",
    ", one may argue that possible contamination from mwc297 makes an artificial flare of iras18245 - 0342 .",
    "we thus made an x - ray light curve of a blank sky at the same angular distance from mwc297 , then found no contamination , nor any flare - like event from the blank sky .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the flare is not an artifact but is really coming from the iras18245 - 0342 .",
    "we then fit the spectra to a bremsstrahlung model with interstellar absorption .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table [ best_fit_s2 ] .",
    "we see consistent results for the column density between the second and third observations although the errors are large .",
    "we then fixed to an averaged value ( 1.5 @xmath1 10@xmath33 @xmath16 ) and obtained acceptable fittings again with the parameters listed in table [ best_fit_s2 ] .",
    "although 90% errors are still overlapped , the temperature is lower in the third observation .",
    "thus , we suspect that iras18245 - 0342 also shows a flare with a cooling process .    assuming that iras18245 - 0342 is the same member of the star forming region with mwc 297 , hence at the same distance , the flare luminosity is estimated to be 6.5 @xmath1 10@xmath38 ergs / s ( 0.4@xmath2310kev ) .",
    "a flare with this luminosity , together with the moderate absorption of n@xmath39 10@xmath33 @xmath16 , is consistent with the scenario that iras18245 - 0342 is an embedded low mass yso .",
    "we found a hard x - ray flare from the position of mwc297 .",
    "the flare phenomena of the first rise associated with an increase of temperature , and slow exponential decay associated with an apparent cooling resemble to those from low mass ysos .",
    "we thus discuss whether the x - rays are due to the herbig be star mwc 297 , and what is the emission mechanism and other relevant issues .",
    "testi , palla , & natta ( 1998 ) found about twenty sources in the asca error circle around mwc297 with the k - band absolute magnitude m@xmath40 brighter than 5.2 .",
    "the star formation activity probably occurs simultaneously in a dense cloud core , hence the ages of these nearby stars would be the same as mwc297 .",
    "the age of mwc297 is estimated to be @xmath18 10@xmath41 years , which is equivalent to the protostar phase in low mass stars .",
    "thus , most of the ir sources are likely to be low mass protostars .",
    "low mass protostars , at least some fractions , are known to exhibit highly absorbed hard x - rays even in the quiescent phase ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; kamata et al . 1997 ; tsuboi et al .",
    "1999 ) , which resemble those found from mwc297 .",
    "are present x - rays due to a protostar ?",
    "the luminosity of a protostar in the quiescent phase is typically less than 10@xmath38 ergs / s , which is less than 10% of the present mwc297 luminosity .",
    "integrated flux from many protostars may account for the observed high flux , but a simple time profile of the flare can not be reproduced by integrated emission from many objects .",
    "the flare peak and total flare energy of the present observations are more than 4.9 @xmath1 10@xmath2 ergs / s and 2.7 @xmath1 10@xmath34 ergs , respectively .",
    "both values largely exceed those of the flare from protostars .",
    "thus , quiescent and flare x - rays are not attributable to protostars , regardless of single or integrated emission of many protostars .",
    "we found that the x - ray determined n@xmath36 to mwc297 is in good agreement with the visual extinction of mwc297 . the millimeter continuum map taken by henning et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which traces dense and cold envelopes has a clear peak at the position of mwc297 , hence the n@xmath36 we observed is locally concentrated near to mwc297 .",
    "furthermore , no companion star with mwc297 is found from the binary search studied by pirzkal , spillar , & dyck ( 1997 ) although the probability to detect an existing companion is not high ( @xmath18 23% ) .",
    "these facts lead us to conclude that x - rays are really attributable to the herbig be star mwc297 .",
    "the luminosity ratio of x - rays to bolometric ( l@xmath42/l@xmath43 ) of massive stars is typically 10@xmath4410@xmath45 ( long & white 1980 ; chlebowski , harnden , & sciortino 1989 ) .",
    "the lx / l@xmath43 ratio of mwc297 in the quiescent phase is 3 @xmath1 10@xmath46 , which is a typical value for massive stars .",
    "this may support that x - rays from mwc297 are due to the same mechanisms of those of massive stars ; the stellar wind shock model .",
    "nisini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) derive the terminal velocity of mwc297 as 380 km / s from the flux ratio between the 3.6 cm radio continuum and the br@xmath47 line emission .",
    "then , the plasma temperature can be estimated to be at most @xmath18 0.25 kev , which is almost one order of magnitude smaller than those of the observed value of @xmath0 2.7 kev in the quiescent phase .",
    "we note that the stronger stellar wind with higher velocity in more massive stars produce a plasma temperature typically less than 1 kev ( seward et al .",
    "1979 ; harnden et al .",
    "1979 ) .",
    "also , the rapid x - ray variability in a day detected in mwc297 is unusual for massive stars with an exception of an o9.5 star @xmath48-orionis , which showed a small increase of the x - ray flux by @xmath18 30% in 2 days ( berghofer & schmitt 1994a , 1994b ) .",
    "this can be explained by the stellar wind model that fast - moving material impacts on slowly moving denser shells .",
    "the variation of the x - ray intensity is due to the fluctuation of the emission measure .",
    "however , this scenario predicts no significant change of the plasma temperature during the flare , hence it is not the case for mwc297 .",
    "thus , the stellar wind model is unlikely for x - ray emission from mwc297 in both quiescent and flare phases .",
    "we note that high temperature plasma with @xmath18 2 kev in haebes is also reported in hd104237 ( skinner & yamauchi 1996 ) and iras 12496 - 7650 ( yamauchi et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "infrared observations suggest several similarities between haebes and low mass pmss .",
    "x - ray properties of mwc297 and other haebes also resemble those of low mass pmss .",
    "the plasma temperature of the quiescent phase ( 1@xmath233kev for low mass pmss ) is the same with that of mwc297 and other haebes ( @xmath18 2 kev ) .",
    "low mass pmss occasionally exhibit rapid flares with the shape of fast - rise and exponential - decay , whose peak intensity is about 2@xmath2320 times as large as in the quiescent phase ( e.g. montmerle et al .",
    "1983 ; koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; tsuboi et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the flare of mwc297 also has a strong peak at least five times as large as the quiescent phase followed by an exponential - decay , although the @xmath3-folding time of mwc297 ( @xmath18 15 hrs ) is longer than those of low mass pmss of a few hours .",
    "we note that an x - ray flare found from a classical be star , @xmath49-eridani ( smith et al . 1993 ) also shows a long duration of about 50 ksec .",
    "these indicate that x - rays from mwc297 are , like those of low mass pmss , due to magnetic activities . assuming radiative cooling for the flare event",
    ", we evaluate the electron density ( n@xmath50 ) and the volume of the plasma ( v ) from the equations of lx = n@xmath51 and @xmath52 = 3n@xmath53 ( @xmath54 , the emissivity ;  @xmath52 , the cooling time scale of the plasma ) . the electron density ( 4.4 @xmath1 10@xmath55 @xmath56 )",
    "is typical for solar and low - mass stellar flares .",

    "1992 ) , and the magnetic plasma loop , for example , can be located on the stellar surface .",
    "the problem of the magnetic activity scenario , however , is that massive stars do not have a surface convection zone , which is required for a conventional dynamo process ( e.g. palla 1999 ) .",
    "an alternative mechanism for a magnetic amplification is that the disk shear instability and the turbulence in the accretion disk also act as dynamo ( brandenburg et al .",
    "the infrared and radio observations of herbig be stars generally show no evidence of a disk ( natta , grinin , & mannings 1999 ) .",
    "neither outflow nor an optical jet are seen around mwc297 itself .",
    "hence , this scenario is controversial for the case of mwc297 .    `` fossil '' magnetic field inherited from the parent molecular cloud ( tayler 1987 ) or shear dynamo activity by tapping the initial stellar differential rotation ( tout & pringle 1995 ) is more likely .",
    "the flare plasma of mwc297 shows lower abundance than that in the quiescent phase although their 90% confidence errors overlap with each other .",

    "however , no conclusive scenario for the apparent abundance variations has been proposed .",
    "the flare spectrum is also fitted to a power - law model ( see table [ best_fit_mwc297 ] ) .",
    "hence , a possibility of non - thermal x - ray emission from stellar plasma can not be excluded .",
    "non - thermal bremsstrahlung x - rays above 20 kev are found with the japanese solar x - ray observatory yohkoh , which are explained by the collision of accelerated electrons in the flare loop to the solar surface ( sakao , kosugi , & masuda 1998 ) .",

    "<S> hard x - ray emissions from a herbig be star mwc297 were discovered in three separate observations spanning 5 days in april 1994 with the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) . </S>",
    "<S> an x - ray flare was found at the beginning of the second observation with a maximum luminosity of @xmath0 4.9 @xmath1 10@xmath2 ergs / s , which is five times larger than that of the quiescent phase ( the first observation ) . </S>",
    "<S> it then declined with an @xmath3-folding time of @xmath0 5.6 @xmath1 10@xmath4 sec to the pre - flare level in the third observation . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra are explained by absorbed thin - thermal plasma models . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature in the quiescent phase of @xmath0 2.7 kev is significantly higher than that of main - sequence ob stars and similar to low mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) and other herbig ae / be stars observed with asca . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature increased in the flare phase to about 6.7 kev at the flux maximum , then decreased to 3.2 kev in the decay phase .    </S>",
    "<S> these facts strongly suggest that x - rays from herbig ae / be stars , at least for mwc297 , are attributable to magnetic activity similar to low mass ysos . </S>",
    "<S> since no theory predicts surface convection zone in massive stars like mwc297 , our results may require a mechanism other than the conventional stellar dynamo theory . </S>",
    "<S> possible magnetic activity could be either the stellar interior shear or the inherited magnetic field from the parent molecular cloud . </S>"
