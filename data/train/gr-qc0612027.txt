    "direct @xcite and indirect @xcite evidence of the present acceleration of the universe is accumulating .",
    "nonetheless , the source of the accelerated expansion is as elusive as ever . in the context of general relativity",
    ", one needs to hypothesize a dark energy source with negative pressure to accommodate the acceleration .",
    "alternative ideas include various modifications to gravity .",
    "little is known about the dark energy except that its pressure is negative , and that it accounts for about @xmath0 of the critical density of the universe . whether the dark energy is the cosmological constant or a dynamically evolving source of energy is a fundamental unanswered question .",
    "while the cosmological constant has a fixed ratio of pressure to energy density , @xmath1 , dynamical dark energy ( dde ) will in general have a varying equation of state ( eos ) , @xmath2 . observing a deviation from @xmath3 or",
    "a time - evolution in the eos will be decisive evidence in favor of the existence of dde .",
    "however , there are known degeneracies @xcite which make this task extremely difficult , unless the deviation from a cosmological constant is strong .",
    "the current observational limit on the eos of dark energy is roughly @xmath4 at the @xmath5 level @xcite , which is consistent with a cosmological constant .",
    "future experiments hold out the possibility of pinning down this limit by maybe a factor of @xmath6 . for a recent review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the effect of the cosmological constant and dde on the expansion rate can be identical , and there is a need for probes that go beyond the background to distinguish between the two .",
    "an example of such a probe is structure formation .",
    "there are numerous works exploring the formation of structure in the presence of homogeneous dark energy @xcite .",
    "an exciting and somewhat controversial possible difference between the cosmological constant and dde is their clustering behavior .",
    "while the cosmological constant is exactly homogeneous on all scales , dde is expected to be not perfectly homogeneous @xcite , and the implications of this on the cmb are well known @xcite .",
    "however , it is usually assumed that the clustering of dde is negligible on scales less than @xmath7 .",
    "whether small perturbations in dde can be neglected is debatable , and a deeper understanding of the dde inhomogeneous dynamics is clearly needed .",
    "several recent works have explored the consequences of dde clustering on scales shorter than @xmath7 . some have adopted a phenomenological approach , parameterizing the clustering degree of dde @xcite .",
    "these works point out potential observables of dde clustering , justifying further investigation .",
    "works which attempt a more fundamental treatment are mostly in the context of coupled dark energy @xcite , or other non - trivial models of dde @xcite , as clustering is most probable in such theories .",
    "however , less attention has been given to the clustering in simpler models of dde .",
    "in the present work , we aim to further explore the inhomogeneous behavior of dde .",
    "our approach is straightforward : starting with a gravitational action which includes matter and dde , we numerically follow the linear evolution of spherical perturbations of matter and the dde response to these perturbations . for the sake of simplicity , our model for the dde is a light scalar field , which is not explicitly coupled to the matter density . as the only coupling between the dde and the matter is gravitational , our results are conservative in the sense that any model more complicated will exhibit stronger dde perturbations than shown here .",
    "the striking feature that emerges from our calculation is that in the vicinity of collapsing matter , the dde develops a spatial profile and tends to form voids .",
    "the mechanism that allows the void to form is that although initially the field s evolution is friction dominated due to the cosmic expansion , the collapse of matter slows down the local expansion .",
    "this allows the field to locally roll down and lose energy , creating the void .",
    "the presence of the matter perturbation is necessary to trigger this mechanism .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section [ the model ] we describe our model in detail . in section [ results ]",
    "we present our results .",
    "we discuss our results and state our conclusions in sections [ discussion ] and [ conclusions ] respectively .",
    "we are interested in spherical perturbations around a flat frw universe .",
    "the most general line element in comoving coordinates is then @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are general functions @xcite .",
    "we take a cosmic mix of non - relativistic matter and a dde component as the energy source .",
    "the matter component is described by a perfect and pressureless fluid , with an energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the energy density of matter .",
    "we model the dde with a classical scalar field @xmath13 with a lagrangian @xmath14 given by @xmath15 and an energy - momentum tensor given by @xmath16    the eos of the dde @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 with the energy density @xmath19 and the pressure @xmath20 are read off the energy momentum tensor , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "+ it is convenient to rewrite einstein s equations in the following way , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the reimann tensor , and @xmath25 .",
    "as there is no explicit interaction between the matter and the dde , energy conservation applies to each separately , @xmath26    the time - evolution of the system is given by the following equations ( where dots denote time - derivatives and primes denote derivatives with respect to the radial coordinate , except for @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 these are subject to the following constraint equations : @xmath29      we now proceed to separate our variables to a homogeneous background and a time and space - dependent perturbation , which we will then linearize . working in the synchronous gauge @xcite , we redefine the metric functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 as follows : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the scale factor of the spatially homogenous and flat background , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the deviations .",
    "we introduce a perturbation around a homogeneous background also in the matter and the dde , @xmath36    the zeroth order of equations - gives @xmath37&=&0    \\\\",
    "\\label{h0 } \\dot{h}+3h^2-k\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho+      v\\right)&=&0   \\\\",
    "\\label{rho0 } \\dot{\\rho}+3h\\rho&=&0   \\\\",
    "\\label{phi0 } \\ddot{\\phi}+3h\\dot{\\phi}+v'&=&0 ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the hubble function .",
    "+ to linear order , the evolution equations - give @xmath39 and the constraint equations - reduce to @xmath40    combining equations , and gives @xmath41    the only combination which is relevant to the equations of motion and is @xmath42 . comparing and",
    "it is clear that @xmath43 can be thought of as @xmath44 , and therefore characterizes the spatial profile of the hubble function . at the cost of losing some information about the metric",
    ", we can reduce the number of our variables and equations from @xmath45 to @xmath46 by solving for @xmath43 instead of for @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "equations  , and yield @xmath49 finally , by fourier - transforming @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 into @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively , equations - can be written as a set of ordinary differential equations : @xmath56 where we have used the fact that to linear order , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "observationally distinguishing between various potentials of dde is a formidable task @xcite , and a careful analysis of the growth of structure in various potentials might prove a useful tool .",
    "our present goal though is to trace generic properties of dde .",
    "accordingly , we choose to work with a simple mass potential , @xmath59 we take the mass scale comparable to the present hubble scale , @xmath60 .",
    "the light mass assures a slow roll behavior , which will provide accelerated cosmic expansion . unless noted otherwise",
    ", the figures presented here refer to this mass potential .    in order to verify the generality of our results",
    ", we repeated the analysis for a more realistic potential - the double exponential @xcite , @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "as we later show , the resulting behavior for the two potentials is qualitatively the same .",
    "we want to study how the dde reacts to the clustering of matter .",
    "thus our initial conditions are of perturbed matter and homogeneous dde .",
    "the matter perturbation is taken as a spherical gaussian , @xmath64 and the dde is taken to be initially homogeneous , @xmath65 . a non - homogeneous evolution for the dark energy is nonetheless allowed .",
    "to ensure that the matter perturbation has no peculiar velocity , we choose the initial condition for the metric variable as @xmath66 . from equation , we find that this amounts to the statement that initially , @xmath67 , _ i.e.",
    "_ the matter particles making up the perturbation are being simply carried along with the hubble expansion ( or in other words , they are at rest in a comoving frame ) .",
    "however , we have verified that choosing different initial values of @xmath43 does not qualitatively affect our results .",
    "the numerical calculation begins at a redshift of @xmath68 with a perturbation amplitude of @xmath69 , and is run to the present , @xmath70 .",
    "we focus on relatively short - scale perturbations , @xmath71 . with this choice of redshift span , we aim to explore the full linear range of the matter perturbation , while also allowing for a period of dde dominance .",
    "the initial values of the background variables @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are chosen such that their present values ( denoted with a @xmath75 subscript ) converge to @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and a normalized hubble value , @xmath78 .",
    "this is done with the help of a root - finding algorithm .",
    "we take @xmath79 , which means that the initial state of the scalar field is homogeneous and with equation of state @xmath80 , similar to the cosmological constant .",
    "we now have the layout to numerically evolve equations - .",
    "the solutions for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are then fourier transformed back to real space .",
    "the results shown in this section are for the mass potential , equation , unless specifically noted otherwise .",
    "the numerical run begins at a redshift of @xmath68 , when the dde is subdominant .",
    "the dde remains subdominant through most of the growth time of the perturbation as well , and accordingly , we expect the matter density contrast @xmath84 to grow as the scale factor @xmath85 .",
    "this is indeed confirmed by our results .",
    "the most striking result that emerges from our calculation is that in the vicinity of collapsing matter , the dde tends to form voids , or growing regions of under - density .",
    "the anti - correlation between the perturbations of the matter and the dde was noted in @xcite and in @xcite for particular cases .",
    "figure [ void_demo1 ] plots the dde density contrast @xmath86 at the center of the matter perturbation , @xmath87 , against the redshift @xmath88 .",
    "we find that the amplitude of the perturbation grows sharply at late times .",
    "figure [ void_demo2 ] shows the growth of the absolute value of the dde perturbation with redshift on a logarithmic scale .",
    "this plot reveals another interesting effect : the initial response of the dde to the gravitationally collapsing matter is a very weak tendency to collapse .",
    "the collapsing phase , however , is extremely short - lived ( an @xmath89 $ ] fraction of the total time of the run ) .",
    "the kink in the figure is the cross - over from a positive to negative perturbation .",
    "we next look at the spatial profiles of the perturbations .",
    "figure [ profiles ] shows the profiles of both the @xmath90 and @xmath91 at an early stage of the run ( @xmath92 ) , at an intermediate redshift ( @xmath93 ) and at the final stage ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the x - axis shows the physical scale as a fraction of the horizon size .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbations is shown on a logarithmic scale , and it is worth noting the change in gap between the two scales .",
    "the growth rate of @xmath91 is significantly faster than that of @xmath90 , so that the two amplitudes are almost comparable at late times .",
    "this suggests that a calculation of the non - linear regime might reveal interesting behavior of the dde .",
    "figures [ sigma_effect1 ] and [ sigma_effect2 ] show how the growth of the dde perturbation is affected by the initial width of the matter perturbation .",
    "the figure confirms the sensitivity of dde perturbations to the scale , and as expected , shorter scales exhibit a suppressed behavior .",
    "nonetheless , a possibly significant amplitude can be found on relevant scales .",
    "for instance , our local supercluster has diameter of order @xmath94 and an overdensity of about @xmath95 .",
    "our runs of @xmath96 end with an overdensity of @xmath97 , but roughly they can be taken as a measure of what we should expect on these scales . also , one must remember that this analysis only captures the physics of the linear regime .",
    "given the sharp increase in the void amplitude at later times , it is not unreasonable to expect interesting effects in the strongly non - linear regime .",
    "figures [ mass_effect1 ] and [ mass_effect2 ] examine the sensitivity to the field s mass .",
    "as expected , increasing the mass of the scalar field causes @xmath91 to grow stronger and at increasingly earlier redshifts .",
    "one can also see that if the mass is heavy enough ( an order of magnitude larger than the hubble mass ) , the field will have had enough time to enter a period of rapid oscillations , and will effectively behave as regular matter .",
    "we would now like to focus on the local behavior of the equation of state ( eos ) of the scalar field .",
    "let us define @xmath98 as the background homogeneous eos , @xmath99 as the leading order correction to @xmath98 and let the first - order corrected @xmath17 be @xmath100 : @xmath101 where to first order @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and we have suppressed the @xmath13 subscripts .",
    "figure [ total_w ] shows how @xmath104 increases with time and becomes non - homogenous .",
    "the eos at the perturbation is less negative than the background , but for this choice of mass it is still negative enough to behave as dark energy .",
    "+ to quantify the extent of the inhomogeneity in @xmath17 we define @xmath105 to characterize the % deviation of the local @xmath17 from the background value , @xmath106 the evolution of the @xmath105 spatial profile is shown in figure [ delta_w ] .",
    "we now aim to intuitively explain why the dde perturbation initially increases and then sharply drops in the presence of the matter perturbation .",
    "initially , both the scalar field and the hubble function are homogenous .",
    "the matter perturbation introduces an inhomogeneity in the hubble function , as regions with matter overdensity expand slower due to the increased gravitational pull . as a result",
    ", @xmath107 acquires a spatial profile which evolves in time along with the matter overdensity , due to the @xmath108 term in equation .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ dh_vs_r ] , which plots the spatial profile of the % deviation of @xmath107 from the homogeneous background value , at three different redshifts .",
    "regions which have a lower local value of @xmath107 offer less hubble damping to the scalar field , as the @xmath109 contribution in equation is negative .",
    "therefore , in these regions the scalar field accelerates down its potential slightly faster , the local @xmath110 has a bigger absolute value than the acceleration of the background , @xmath111 .",
    "thus the matter perturbation imparts a local `` downhill kick '' to the field , and the strength of the kick depends on the magnitude of the matter perturbation at that point .",
    "the presence of matter is essential to trigger this mechanism .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in @xcite .",
    "since the matter perturbation is gaussian , we can expect the profile of @xmath112 to be gaussian as well , which is confirmed in figure [ de_accn_vs_r ] .",
    "the acceleration of the field perturbation @xmath113 is zero initially ( @xmath68 ) , but it quickly takes on a gaussian profile , which initially grows , and then shrinks at later times . the important point to note in figure [ de_accn_vs_r ]",
    "is that the acceleration weakens , but does nt change its sign throughout the evolution .",
    "the acceleration profile leads to spatial variations in the energy density of the dde .",
    "for the mass potential , the linear order of the density perturbation is @xmath114 , where the first term represents the local variation in kinetic energy ( ke ) and the second term represents the local variation in potential energy ( pe ) . whether the initial value of the scalar field was shifted to the right or left of its minimum , @xmath115 and @xmath116 will be of the same sign , assuring a positive correction to the ke . on the other hand , @xmath13 and @xmath117",
    "will be of opposite signs , assuring the pe correction will be negative .",
    "the total correction to the energy density then will be positive when the ke dominates , creating an overdensity , and negative when the pe correction dominates , creating a void .",
    "the fact that @xmath113 weakens but does nt change its sign assures that @xmath116 approaches a constant value , but @xmath117 keeps growing .",
    "the pe contribution @xmath118 soon becomes dominant over the ke correction , @xmath119 .",
    "as soon this happens , a void is created .",
    "+ similar reasoning should apply to other slow - roll potentials .",
    "the results we have presented so far were for the mass potential , equation .",
    "this is not a very attractive model from the theoretical point of view , as the choice of the mass scale and initial conditions are fine tuned .",
    "while the general problem of fine tuning has not yet been resolved , the issue of the initial conditions is alleviated in tracking potentials such as equation . to verify that our results are not unique to the mass potential , we have repeated the analysis for the double exponential potential .",
    "we present here the equivalent of figures [ profiles ] and [ total_w ] to show that the results are essentially similar : as a reaction to the perturbation in the matter fluid , the dde quickly forms a void . starting very low ,",
    "the rate of growth of its amplitude is significantly faster than that of the matter perturbation , motivating a further investigation into the non linear regime .",
    "in this work we have investigated the clustering properties of dde .",
    "we modeled the dde as a scalar field with a light mass , and have shown that in the vicinity of gravitationally collapsing matter , the dde develops inhomogeneities and forms voids .",
    "our results show a high sensitivity to the mass scale of the field . for a mass much larger or smaller than the hubble scale ,",
    "the field imitates the behavior of dust or the cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "the interesting dynamics is most prominent in the window where the mass and hubble scales are comparable .",
    "this window is within the relevant mass range for dark energy models . as the hubble function was larger in the past , heavier fields would have had comparable mass and hubble scales at some point in the past .",
    "our results should apply to any model of dde which achieves the present acceleration through a slow roll phase , as the slow roll assures that only a small patch of the potential is probed .",
    "we have shown this explicitly for the double exponential potential .",
    "whether our results apply to an even wider class of models which achieve accelerated expansion not through slow roll should be further investigated .",
    "one thing which is clear from our results , is that dde has potentially non - trivial behavior during the growth of inhomogeneities , though full non - linear analysis is needed to confirm whether the amplitude of the dde inhomogeneities is relevant to observations . as",
    "inhomogeneities of dark energy are a clear signature differentiating between the cosmological constant and dde , such possibilities should be fully explored and exhausted .",
    "a full treatment of the observational consequences of our results is beyond the scope of this work , but we would like to mention a few possibilities . some obvious places to look for dde inhomogeneities include lensing , the isw effect in the cmb , number counts , and mass functions . some of these directions are being pursued @xcite .",
    "our results show that both the energy density and the eos of dde develop a spatial dependence .",
    "thus any observation constraining either of the above which can separately be measured locally and globally is valuable . +",
    "another possibility which we would like to point out , is that it would be useful to quantify the effect of a statistical distribution of dde voids on the cmb , or , following reference @xcite , on the directional distribution of supernovae .",
    "for example , detecting an angular inhomogeneity in @xmath107 which is not in accordance with the matter distribution might suggest the presence of a dde void .",
