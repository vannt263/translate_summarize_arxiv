    "over the past few years we have been witness to vigorous experimental , phenomenological and theoretical investigations of the proton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure functions and some exclusive channels with small @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these comprehensive studies aim at establishing the applicability and possible need for a re - formulation of pqcd , as we know it , when approaching the kinematic interface with the less understood npqcd dominated domain .",
    "the standard procedure for the pqcd analysis of dis on a nucleon target has been to utilize the dglap evolution equations for the structure functions as the key ingredient for fixing the parton distribution functions ( p.d.f . ) .",
    "these p.d.f .",
    "are then used as input for the calculations of exclusive dis channels , usually executed in the color dipole approximation .",
    "the physics of small @xmath2 and small @xmath3 is associated with the search for the scale of gluon saturation implied by s - channel unitarity @xcite .",
    "one should remember , though , that gluon saturation signals the transition from perturbative to non perturbative qcd .",
    "this transition is preceded by sc signatures which are expected to be experimentally visible even though the relevant scattering amplitude has not yet reached the unitarity black limit . moreover , from our experience with soft pomeron physics , we know that different channels have different scales at which unitarity corrections become appreciable . specifically , the scale associated with the diffractive channels are considerably smaller than those associated with the elastic channel @xcite .",
    "inspite of significant theoretical progress in recent years @xcite , it is still not clear what the saturation scale in the present experimentally accesible kinematic region is .",
    "we recall that , while the global analysis of @xmath1 ( or @xmath12 ) data shows no conclusive deviations from dglap , there are dedicated hera investigations suggesting deviations from the dglap expectations in the small @xmath2 and @xmath3 limits .",
    "these signatures are observed in both the fine details of @xmath1 as well as in the diffractive channels , provided @xmath2 and @xmath3 are small enough .    in the following",
    "we present a detailed study of @xmath4 which is supported by a coupled analysis of @xmath5 photo and dis production .",
    "the strategy of our investigation is based on the observation that these observables ( in lla of pqcd ) are linear in @xmath6 and @xmath13 respectively , and being relatively well measured may serve as effective discriminators when we compare their detailed features with existing relevant theoretical approaches and models . in the first phase of our investigation , we found that none of the latest p.d.f .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite provides an adequate simultaneous reproduction , at small pqcd scales , of the recent hera data on the logarithmic slope of @xmath7 @xcite@xcite at small @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as well as the abundant high energy data on @xmath5 photo and dis production @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we then proceed to show that when grv98nlo is corrected for sc , as suggested in our previous publications @xcite@xcite , it gives a good description of these data .",
    "the sc calculation depends on one parameter , @xmath8 , which is directly deduced from the @xmath5 photoproduction forward differential slope .",
    "we elaborate on a recent suggestion @xcite that the gluon saturation scale may be determined by examining the behaviour of @xmath14 against @xmath2 and @xmath3 at fixed w values . in our opinion , this suggestion which was discussed also in a recent presentation of the zeus new data @xcite , reflects the particular kinematic relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath3 and does not provide an unambiguous determination of the desired scale .",
    "our approach can be tested in the high energy analysis of photo and dis exclusive production of @xmath5 .",
    "this is seemingly a straight forward procedure as the lla pqcd calculation of this cross section is proportional to @xmath16 , where @xmath3 and @xmath17 are determined from @xmath18 , the c - quark mass , and w , the c.m .",
    "a realistic calculation depends on a few corrections to the original pqcd estimate : @xmath19 due to the amplitude real part , @xmath20 due to the contribution of the off diagonal ( skewed ) gluon distribution @xcite and @xmath21 due to the fermi motion deviations from the simple static non relativistic estimate of the @xmath5 wave function @xcite .",
    "all of these corrections contribute to the final ( amplitude squared ) estimate .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of this channel which is consistent with our approach and input choices made in the analysis of @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude with some general comments and observations on the outstanding problems of gluon saturation and screening corrections .",
    "checking for unitarity corrections in @xmath7 studies is not simple . as is well known , a global dglap analysis of the data with the recent p.d.f .",
    "@xcite@xcite@xcite is adequate .",
    "a study @xcite comparing the screened and non screened dglap calculations of @xmath1 showed only a small difference due to sc even in the small @xmath2 and @xmath3 attained by present hera measurements .",
    "clearly , a unitarity study in the above kinematic limit requires a dedicated investigation , confined to small @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can magnify the presumed experimental signatures .",
    "we recall that in the small @xmath3 limit of dglap we have [ a ] = xg^dglap(x , q^2 ) .",
    "accordingly , a significant deviation of the data from , where @xmath22 is obtained from the global @xmath7 analysis , may serve as an experimental signature indicating the growing importance of unitarity corrections .",
    "this was first suggested by caldwell @xcite , showing a rather complicated plot of @xmath4 in which each point had different @xmath2 and @xmath3 values .",
    "the caldwell plot suggested a dramatic turn over of @xmath23 corresponding to @xmath2 of about @xmath24 and @xmath25 in contrast to the behavior expected from grv94 @xcite at sufficiently small @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the problem with this presentation is that , as suggestive as it may seem , it does not discriminate between different dynamical interpretations @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is actually compatible with an overall data generator @xcite as well as the latest p.d.f . which were re - adjusted to account for this observation .",
    "we conclude that , where as a reproduction of the cadwell plot is required as a pre condition for a serious consideration of any suggested model , the plot on its own can not serve as an effective discriminator between models even in the extreme case when they are fundamentally different .    a far better discrimination is obtained if we carefully study the small @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependences of @xmath23 at either fixed @xmath2 or fixed @xmath3 values being free from the kinematic correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 that plagued the caldwell plot .",
    "such preliminary hera data have recently became available @xcite@xcite . as we shall show , a pqcd analysis of these data is consistent with a sc interpretation @xcite .",
    "we follow the eikonal sc formalism presented in ref.@xcite , where screening is calculated in both the quark sector , to account for the percolation of a @xmath9 through the target , and the gluon sector , to account for the screening of @xmath6 .",
    "the factorizable result that we obtain is [ b ] = d_q(x , q^2)d_g(x , q^2 ) .",
    "sc in the quark section are given by [ c1 ] d_q(x , q^2)= db^2@xmath26 , [ c2 ] _ q = xg^dglap(x , q^2)(b^2 ) .",
    "the calculation is significantly simplified if we assume a gaussian parameterization for the two gluon non perturbative form factor , [ c3 ] ( b^2)=e^-b^2/r^2 .",
    "sc in the gluon sector are given by [ d1 ] xg^sc(x , q^2)=d_g(x , q^2 ) xg^dglap(x , q^2 ) , where [ d2 ] xg^sc(x , q^2)= _ x^1 _ 0^q^2dq^2 db^2@xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath28 defined in .",
    "an obvious difficulty in the above calculation of @xmath29 stems from the fact that the @xmath30 integration spans not only the short ( pqcd ) , but also the long ( npqcd ) distances . to overcome this difficulty we assume that [ d3 ] xg@xmath31=xg@xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "our choice of the above interpolation is motivated by the gauge invariance requirement that @xmath34 when @xmath35 .",
    "the sc calculation described above can be applied to any given input p.d.f . where the only adjusted parameters are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , @xmath38 is determined directly from the forward slope of @xmath5 photoproduction .",
    "@xmath37 is conveniently fixed at @xmath39 , the lowest @xmath2 value accessible for the input p.d.f .",
    "once we have chosen our p.d.f .",
    ", our sc calculation is essentially parameter free .",
    "we have checked that our output results are not sensitive to the fine tuning of these fixed parameters .",
    "our results are presented in figs .",
    "1,2 and 3 . throughout this investigation",
    "we have used as input the @xmath40 version of grv98nlo .",
    "using the grv98dis version provides very similar results . following are some comments relating to our calculations and results : 1 ) as can be seen , in the limit of small @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "there is a significant difference between the screened and non screened values of @xmath23 .",
    "as expected the sc results are smaller and softer than the non screened input .",
    "2 ) visibly , our overall reproduction of the experimental data is very good , in particular when considering that our input is essentially parameter free .",
    "a proper @xmath41 calculation requires the knowledge of the unknown theoretical errors .",
    "3 ) if we follow the standard procedure and replace the theoretical errors with the experimental ones , we obtain excellent @xmath42 for 21 h1 data points with the exception of 3 points which are visibly out of line .",
    "the zeus data has errors which are considerably smaller and as a result our @xmath43 is not as good , even though our reproduction of the zeus data is reasonable .",
    "4 ) the zeus @xmath44 and h1 @xmath45 data are somewhat softer than our predictions , which do not contain a soft non perturbative background .",
    "golec - biernat and wuesthoff @xcite have suggested studying the @xmath2 and @xmath3 behaviour of @xmath23 at fixed w as a method to determine the gluon saturation scales from the anticipated turn over in these plots .",
    "recent zeus low @xmath2 presentations @xcite of these plots show , indeed , the anticipated turn over structure in these figures , seemingly suggesting that gluon saturation is attained at @xmath46 . in our opinion the proper variables to study @xmath7 are @xmath3 and @xmath2 . trying to study the structure function by introducing other variables , such as w , may result in spurious effects which are predominantly kinematic . in the specific procedure suggested by golec - biernat and wuesthoff ,",
    "the combination of the kinematic relation between @xmath47 and w with the very general behaviour of @xmath6 is sufficient to produce a turn over .",
    "its exact location depends on the details of the numerical input .",
    "consequently , the suggested fixed w plots do not convey any new dynamical information even if such information is hidden in the analyzed data .",
    "actually , it seems that any @xmath7 ( or @xmath48 ) parameterization which factorizes the @xmath2 and @xmath3 dependences , such as the buchmueller- haidt model @xcite , is capable of producing the fixed w turn over effects .    to illustrate this point we consider the fixed w behaviour in two models which have very different dynamics : 1 ) our own glmn @xcite , which is a pure pqcd dipole model with sc .",
    "as such , our model relates indirectly to gluon saturation , even though it is constructed so as to include unitarity corrections below actual saturation .",
    "2 ) the dl two pomeron parametrization @xcite , which is based on the regge formalism , and consists of the coherent sum of contributions from a `` hard '' and a `` soft '' pomeron , a normal reggeon and an additional contribution from the charmed sector which is proportional to the `` hard '' pomeron .",
    "each of these fixed j - poles are multiplied by a fitted @xmath49 form factor .",
    "the parameters of the `` model '' were determined from the requirement of a `` best fit '' to the experimental @xmath50 data , and are not directly associated with the gluon distribution in the proton or `` saturation '' .",
    "the results obtained for the logarithmic slope of @xmath51 at fixed w for both parametrizations are compared to the zeus experimental results in fig.4 and 6 . in figs.5 and 7",
    "we also display the behaviour of @xmath52 at fixed @xmath49 and fixed x. we note that both `` models '' provide a reasonable description of the zeus data including the observed turn over in the fixed w plots.as grv98 is only applicable for @xmath53 , we have repeated the glmn calculation with grv94 which has @xmath54 and again reproduce the zeus fixed w turn over effect",
    ". from the above it appears that any model which provides a reasonable description of @xmath50 will exhibit a turn over in fixed w plots of the logarithmic derivative of @xmath50 , this occurs due to the relation between the kinematic variables x , @xmath49 and w , and is not related to `` saturation '' .",
    "however , the examples ( the buchmueller - haidt model and donnachie - landshoff approach ) which have been used to demonstrate that the  saturation \" is not a unique mechanism for a turn over at fixed @xmath55 , have one common feature : the  soft \" contributions are concentrated at a rather large typical scale @xmath56 .",
    "this observation supports the idea that the so called soft pomeron stems from rather short distances @xcite .",
    "therefore , an equally good description of the experimental data can be achieved either from gluon  saturation \" ( shadowing corrections ) or by matching soft and hard processes if the soft ones occur at rather short distances @xmath57 .    in conclusion , whereas we find strong support for the need for sc in the small @xmath2 and @xmath3 limits for @xmath52 we are unable , as yet , to determine the gluon saturation scale directly from the latest hera data .",
    "the gluon saturation scale may be theoretically estimated from the contours produced at the boundary of @xmath58 , as discussed in our papers @xcite@xcite .",
    "the t=0 differential cross section of photo and dis production can be calculated in the dipole lla approximation @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "when using the static non relativistic approximation of the vector meson wave function @xcite@xcite , the differential cross section has a very simple form , viz .    [ q ]",
    "@xmath59_0= @xmath60 ^ 2 @xmath61 ,    where in the non relativistic limit we have [ q1 ] |q^2= and [ q2 ] x=.    in the following we discuss in some detail the photo and dis production of @xmath5 .",
    "there is a lot of data available for this channel @xcite@xcite@xcite for the integrated cross section spanning a relatively wide energy range . from a theoretical point of view , its hardness ( or separation ) scale is comparable to the scales we have studied in our @xmath23 analysis . to relate the integrated cross section to we need to know @xmath62 , the @xmath5 forward differential cross section slope . for this we may use the experimental values , which are approximately constant .",
    "as we shall see , sc account well for the reported moderate energy dependence @xcite .",
    "the main problem with the theoretical analysis of @xmath5 is the observation that the simple pqcd calculation needs to be corrected for the following reasons : 1 ) a correction for the contribution of the real part of the production amplitude .",
    "this correction is well understood and is given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "2 ) a correction for the contribution of the skewed ( off diagonal ) gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "this correction is calculated to be r_g^2= @xmath66 ^ 2 .",
    "3 ) a more controversial issue relates to the non relativistic approximation assumed for the @xmath5 charmonium .",
    "relativistic effects produced by the fermi motion of the bound quarks result in a considerable reduction of the calculated pqcd cross section @xcite .",
    "we denote this correction @xmath21 and note that it is very sensitive to the value of @xmath18 .",
    "ref.@xcite assumes that @xmath67 and obtains @xmath68 with minimal energy dependence .",
    "a small change in the input value of @xmath18 changes the above estimate significantly .",
    "we suggest , therefore , to consider @xmath21 as a free parameter . in our calculations",
    "we have used @xmath69 which corresponds to a c - quark mass of approximately @xmath70 .    since the @xmath71 photo and dis cross sections are proportional to @xmath13 ,",
    "the study of this channel can serve as a compatibility check supplementing our study of @xmath23 .",
    "as noted in the introduction our sc approach was triggered by the observation that none of the latest p.d.f.s can provide a good simultaneous reproduction of the two channels under consideration .",
    "our calculation of sc for @xmath5 photo and dis production is rather similar to the @xmath2 logarithmic slope calculation presented in the previous section .",
    "we follow our earlier publication @xcite and define the damping factors due to the screening in the quark sector i.e. the percolation of the @xmath72 through the target .",
    "this is given by the following expressions for the longitudinal and transverse dampings [ scl ] d_ql^2= and [ sct ] d_qt^2=    our expression for @xmath73 , the damping in the gluon sector is the square of the gluon damping defined in the previous section .",
    "our final expression for the forward cross section is [ final ] @xmath74_0= c_r^2 c_g^2 c_f^2 @xmath75_0^pqcd d_q^2 d_g^2 , where @xmath76 denotes the l and t components as appropriate .",
    "our calculations as compared with the data are presented in figs.8 and 9 . as can be seen",
    ", our reproduction of the data is excellent with a @xmath77 which is well below 1 .",
    "these excellent @xmath41 values are maintained when calculating over the entire data base as well as limiting ourselves to the high energy hera data . note",
    "that @xmath8 , which is the essential parameter in the sc calculation is determined directly from the @xmath5 photoproduction forward slope . in a model such as ours",
    ", we expect a weak dependence of @xmath78 on the energy @xcite ( see fig.10 ) .",
    "we have shown that nlo grv98 when screened both for the percolation of a @xmath79 pair through the target , and for multigluon exchange provides an excellent repoduction of both the h1 and zeus data for the logarithmic derivative of @xmath50 structure function of the proton .",
    "the experimental data and our model are consistent with @xmath80 ( at fixed @xmath49 ) being a monotonic increasing function of 1/x .",
    "no deviation of this behaviour has been seen even at the lowest values of @xmath49 and x.    the suggested turn over seen in @xmath81 at fixed w , as a function of x or @xmath49 , does not appear to be connected with saturation effects , and can not be used as a discriminator , as it appears in all parametrizations of @xmath51 which provide a reasonable description of the data .",
    "the same screened nlo grv98 also provides an excellent description of the photo and dis production of @xmath82 , once corrections are made for the real part of the production amplitude , for the skewed ( off diagonal ) gluon distribution and for the fermi motion of the bound quarks in the charmonium wave function .    in a seperate publication @xcite",
    "we show that we are unable to obtain a simultaneous good description of @xmath52 and the photo and dis production of @xmath83 using other pdf s on the market e.g. mrs99 , cteq4 and cteq5 even after including screening corrections .",
    "only screened nlo grv98 is able to provide a satisfactory simultaneous description of the latest hera data available for @xmath84 and photo and dis production of @xmath82 .",
