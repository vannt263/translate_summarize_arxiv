    "the masses of heavy quarks , charm and beauty , provide hard scales for perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) calculations .",
    "measurements of heavy flavor production therefore have been and continue to be of great interest as a rich testing ground for the reliability of perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "hera , which collides electrons or positron of energy @xmath1 with protons of energy @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 before 1998 ) resulting in a center - of - mass energy of @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) , can test heavy flavor production in a unique way .",
    "two collider experiments , h1 and zeus , have accumulated approximately @xmath6 of integrated luminosity by the end of 2000 . after a major upgrade during 2001 and 2002 , hera is running at much higher luminosity with the polarized electron beam and is referred to as hera  ii for distinction .",
    "heavy flavor production at hera is dominated by boson - gluon - fusion ( bgf ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgf ] .",
    "when the virtuality @xmath7 of the exchanged boson , mainly photon , is very small , @xmath8 , the virtual photon resembles a real one and the collisions are referred to as @xmath9 or photoproduction , in which a certain fraction of the photons can be resolved with parton contents . for large @xmath7 , the collisions are called deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "only the most recent measurements are presented here .",
    "in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , single - particle inclusive cross sections in @xmath0 collisions can be factorized in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes convolution .",
    "the sum is over all relevant partons @xmath12 , while @xmath13 is a parton density function ( pdf ) of the initial proton , @xmath14 is the pqcd calculable cross section of hard scatter , and @xmath15 is the fragmentation function . in resolved photoproduction ,",
    "an additional pdf of the photon enters the calculation .",
    "these terms are evaluated at a renormalization scale @xmath16 as well as a factorization scale @xmath17 , which is often taken at the same value as @xmath16 .",
    "the pdfs and the fragmentation functions are non - perturbative and must be determined either experimentally or taken from models , but they are universal . in heavy flavor production , the mass of the heavy quark provides an additional hard scale hence yielding more accurate calculations .",
    "up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , the fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) or `` massive '' scheme from  @xcite for photoproduction and from  @xcite for dis and the zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zmvfns ) or `` massless '' scheme from  @xcite and from  @xcite are compared with the data .",
    "they differ in the treatment of mass of heavy quark . in the massive scheme ,",
    "the heavy quarks are non - active flavors in the proton and are produced through hard scatter such as bgf , while in the massless scheme , the heavy quarks are just the contents of the proton and can enter the reaction directly .",
    "the massive scheme works well near the threshold of heavy quark production and the massless scheme works better in the higher kinematic region .",
    "a scheme matching the two also exists but is not used for the measurements presented here .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) models , based on leading order qcd and parton shower approaches , are used for acceptance calculations in all measurements , and sometimes as alternative qcd predictions .",
    "they include pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite which differ in the treatment of parton showers and heavy quark fragmentation .",
    "inclusive jet cross sections and dijet correlations in @xmath18 photoproduction have been studied by zeus  @xcite .",
    "nlo predictions in the massive and massless schemes show reasonable agreement with the data in all inclusive jet cross sections as well as some dijet correlation cross sections , but the massive prediction shows a large deviation at low @xmath19 , azimuthal angular difference of two jets , and high @xmath20 , squared transverse momentum of dijet system .",
    "the discrepancy is enhanced in the resolved - enriched sample , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dijet]a",
    ". however , the herwig mc model describes the shape of the data well , fig .",
    "[ fig : dijet]b .",
    "this indicates the necessity of higher - order calculations or additional parton showers in current nlo calculations .",
    "open charm production in dis is directly sensitive to the gluon contents in the proton .",
    "measurements  @xcite of the charm contribution to the proton structure function , @xmath21 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftwocc]a .",
    "the results are well described by a qcd prediction based on a qcd fit of the inclusive structure function @xmath22 .",
    "a measurement exploring the transition region between dis and photoproduction has also been reported recently  @xcite as well as the first charm measurement from hera  ii data  @xcite .",
    "charm fragmentation is traditionally measured at @xmath23 experiments and the results are then adapted into mc simulations or theoretical calculations .",
    "recently , h1 and zeus made measurements on charm fragmentation ratios @xmath24 ( the ratio of neutral to charged @xmath25-meson rates ) , @xmath26 ( the strangeness suppression factor ) and @xmath27 ( the fraction of @xmath25-meson in a vector state ) as well as fragmentation fractions , @xmath28  @xcite . the results are compared to those of @xmath23 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ftwocc]b - d , and confirm the universality of fragmentation .",
    "measurements of the fragmentation function have also been made by h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite , and are in agreement with universality . too .",
    "because of the larger mass , the pqcd calculation for open beauty production should be more reliable than for open charm .",
    "some of the previous measurements  @xcite have found the prediction to be below the data by up to a factor 3 .",
    "recent measurements by h1 and zeus required events containing jets in addition to high @xmath29 muons , which are traditionally used to tag beauty quarks  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mujet]a , the measurements in photoproduction agree very well between the two collaborations and are well described by the nlo calculations although the h1 data is above the calculation at low @xmath30 . in dis ,",
    "similar agreement exists , although discrepancies at low @xmath30 as well as forward @xmath31 are observed by both collaborations , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mujet]b as an example .",
    "new measurements using inclusive impact parameters of tracks from decays of long lived charm and beauty hadrons have been performed in dis by the h1 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "they are the first measurements of @xmath32 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ftwobb ] .",
    "the data are well described by the nlo predictions and a recent calculation using nnlo structure functions  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath21 also confirm the previous data and have been put in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftwocc]a .",
    "significantly improved further measurements are expected from the increased hera  ii statistics and the corresponding detector improvements .",
    "first preliminary results on beauty in photoproduction using the new zeus micro - vertex detector have already been obtained  @xcite .",
    "at hera , measurements on heavy flavor production are getting more extensive and precise .",
    "new results improve the understanding of the heavy quark contributions to the proton structure function as well as the hadronic behavior of the photon .",
    "the universality of the fragmentation has also been confirmed by the recent measurements .",
    "the perturbative qcd calculation generally describes the data at next - to - leading order although discrepancies still exist in some threshold regions .",
    "therefore higher order corrections beyond the existing models and calculations might be needed .",
    "more exciting and accurate measurements are definitely expected in the future from hera  ii with higher luminosity and improved detector ability of the h1 and zeus experiments .",
    "i really appreciate the invitation from the conference organizers .",
    "i am also grateful to a. geiser and m. wing for productive discussions .",
