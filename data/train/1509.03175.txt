    "with more and more upcoming experimental data of rare isotope heavy ion collision at intermediate energies , people have opportunity to explore the properties of nuclear matter with high density and large isospin asymmetry by the tools of transport model . both the mean field and the in - medium two - body scattering cross sections , coming from the same nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction @xcite , should be treated self - consistently in the transport model .",
    "but it is very difficult to solve the dynamical equation and the g - matrix simultaneously , the most of transport models deal with the mean field and collision separately .",
    "so the accurate in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross sections ( nncs ) are required by transport model . on the other hand",
    ", the in - medium nncs can provide information which is very important to study the structure of nuclei especially rare isotopes .",
    "also the in - medium nncs are of interest for their own sake , as they are underly related to the viscosity , the mean free path of nucleon in nuclear matter , and other nuclear transport coefficients @xcite .    unlike the nncs in the free space which can be directly measured by experiment , the in - medium nncs can only be calculated by theory , such as the brueckner - hartree - fock theory , the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock theory , the green function approach , and the relativistic mean field model .",
    "the in - medium nncs depend on several quantities , such as density and isospin - asymmetry of nuclear matter , total momentum of the nucleon pair in the nuclear matter rest frame , the relative momentum of the nucleon pair , even the temperature .",
    "there have been many studies demonstrate that the nncs in medium should be suppressed compared to free nncs @xcite . however , the modification factors given from these works differ significantly , due to the different treatment on the dependence with different levels of approximations .    the other way to get the information of the in - medium nncs is to compare the simulation results from transport theory with experimental data of nuclear reactions . as the basic ingredients of transport model , some kind of simple parametrizations of the in - medium nncs are widely used . such as the parameterizations given by g. li @xcite and q. li @xcite , the phenomenological in - medium nncs scaled by effective mass @xcite @xmath0 ^ 2\\sigma^{\\rm free}_{\\rm nn } ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the reduced masses of colliding nucleon pairs in the vacuum and medium , respectively , and the empirical relation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "consistent with theory results , the most of experimental evidences , such as balance energy @xcite , stopping power @xcite , collective flow @xcite , etc , support a reduced in - medium nucleon - nucleon elastic cross sections ( nnecs ) .",
    "but the reduced factor has not been determined very definitely . since both the mean field and the two body collisions",
    "are convoluted , model dependent treatment of the nuclear potential as well as the collisions may yield considerable discrepancies in the model outputs even for the simplest box calculations .",
    "compared to the heavy ion collision , some kind of direct reactions involve less degrees of freedom in the reaction process may reduce the model dependence .",
    "so the nucleon - induced reaction is more suitable to study the in - medium nncs , not only because of its simple mechanism but also because it reflects just the in - medium nncs around the incident beam energy and below the saturation density @xcite .    in this work , with the improved quantum molecular dynamics ( imqmd ) model",
    ", we try to extract the in - medium nnecs from the experimental data of the nucleon - induced reaction cross sections ( rcss ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the model we adopted . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the form of medium modification on nncs , and the way to determine the modification factor . finally a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "within the imqmd05 model @xcite , the mean field acting on nucleon wave packets are derived from an energy functional where the potential energy @xmath5 includes the full skyrme potential energy with just the spin - orbit term omitted @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the coulomb energy , and @xmath8 d \\bm{r}$ ] .",

    "the coefficients utilized in equation can be transcribed , see @xcite , onto those usually specified for the skyrme interactions .",
    "the pauli principle is considered carefully in the collision term .",
    "the neutrons and protons are treated as different particles . according to the uncertainty principle",
    ", the final states of two particles are required to satisfy the relation @xmath15 the @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the distances between the centers of wave packets of two nucleons in coordinate and momentum space .",
    "the possibility being blocked at the final state @xmath18 and @xmath19 for each of the two scattering nucleons is calculated by @xmath20 the @xmath21 and @xmath21 are the probabilities for state @xmath18 and @xmath19 being occupied , which can be calculated by @xmath22   \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(\\bm{p}_{i}-\\bm{p}_{k})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{p}^{2}}\\right ] .",

    "the elastic scattering event is defined as event that the emitted nucleon has its energy close to the incident energy , without considering how many nn collisions are happening in the event . according to the analyzing method used in experiments , here @xmath24",
    "is calculated by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the probability of the events that the incident nucleon only passes through without changing its momentum direction and magnitude , namely , the unaffected events and @xmath30 is the probability of the events that the incident proton only changes its momentum direction but not its momentum magnitude , namely the elastic events , respectively .    as mentioned above ,",

    "all calculation results overestimate the experimental data below 500 mev .",
    "it means that the in - medium nnecs below 500 mev should be smaller than free nnecs and the in - medium nnecs above 500 mev should be very close to free nnecs . to obtain correct medium correction on nnecs , the reasonable eos tested by other method should be used in simulations .",
    "msl0 , one of skyrme parameter sets which best satisfy the current understanding of the physics of nuclear matter over a wide range of applications  @xcite , is used in the following calculations .    according to the above analysis and the other studies on nnsc , in this work ,",

    ", the excitation function of rcs calculated by fu3 and without momentum correction is shown in subfigure ( c ) marked by fu3fp0 .",
    "one can see that the momentum correction dose not obviously affects the results below 50 mev , while the rcss at high energies are underestimated if the momentum correction is absent .",
    "it proves our assumption and means the depressive effect provided by fu3 is a little strong while the one provided by fu2 is a little weak .",

    "[ na ] , the excitation functions of rcs for @xmath65a calculated with fu4fp6 are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
