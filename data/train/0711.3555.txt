    "astrophysical and cosmological measurements together with numerical simulation experiments indicate that the cold dark matter ( cdm ) constitutes most of the matter in the universe , even though the fundamental physical nature of such dark matter particles ( dmps ) remains unknown . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "these cold dmps are presumed to be collisionless and they interact with each other or with other baryons only through the mutual gravity at the present epoch . while the collisionless cdm model is successful in explaining the formation of large - scale structures in the universe , observational contradictions with numerical simulations appear inevitable regarding structures on sub - cluster scales , e.g. , the prediction of a higher number of dwarf galaxies than that actually observed .",
    "spergel & steinhardt ( 2000 ) revitalized the concept of strongly interacting massive particles ( simps ) to confront this issue and suggested a self - interacting cross section per unit dmp mass @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the collisional cross section among dmps and @xmath6 is the dmp mass . along this line of reasoning ,",
    "if dmps are strongly self - interacting , then similar strong interactions would also be equally expected to exist between dmps and baryons .",
    "elastic scatterings between dmps with nuclei could generate a recoil energy of the order of @xmath9 kev , which would then be detectable in underground and underwater particle experiments .",
    "such ` direct detection ' experiments currently limit the cross section to the order of @xmath10 @xmath11 for a cold dmp of mass in the range of @xmath12 gev ( e.g. , akerib et al . 2004 ) .",
    "limits on such collisional interactions in a wider mass range were investigated by various physical experiments and observations of several astrophysical processes , such as @xmath13 decays , cosmic - ray detections , the galactic - halo stability , the cooling of molecular clouds , proton decay experiments , the existence of old neutron stars and the earth ( e.g. , starkman et al . 1990 ) , satellite experiments in space ( e.g. , wandelt et al .",
    "2001 ) , primordial nucleosynthesis and cosmic rays ( e.g. , cyburt et al .",
    "2002 ) , and cosmic microwave background anisotropy and large - scale structure power spectrum ( e.g. , chen et al .",
    "these experiments and observations have provided a limit on the mass - dependent cross section per unit dmp mass between dmps and protons as @xmath14 @xmath11 gev@xmath15 for a dmp mass @xmath16 gev .",
    "recent high - resolution observations of the hot x - ray emitting gaseous intracluster medium ( icm ) by _ chandra _ ( e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "2001 ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( e.g. , kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ; tamura et al . 2001 ) satellites have revealed deficits of cool gases ( with gas temperatures much less than the virial temperature @xmath17 ) in the core of so - called ` cooling flow ' galaxy clusters , inconsistent with predictions of the conventional radiative cooling models ( e.g. , cowie & binney 1977 ; fabian & nulsen 1977 ; mathews & bregman 1978 ; stewart et al .",
    "1984 ; fabian 1994 and extensive references therein ) .",
    "several heating mechanisms have been proposed to resolve this ` cooling flow dilemma ' , such as the inward thermal conduction from hot outer regions ( e.g. , narayan & medvedev 2001 and references therein ) , energy injections associated with central activities by an active galactic nucleus ( e.g. , churazov et al .",
    "2002 ) , and outward or inward acoustic wave heating ( e.g. , pringle 1989 ; fabian et al .",
    "2003a , b ; fujita et al . 2004 ; feng , zhang , lou & li 2004 ) .",
    "the resonant excitation of internal gravity modes ( @xmath18modes ) in the icm by orbiting galaxies was explored by balbus & soker ( 1990 ) ; they examined the processes of excitation , propagation , amplification , damping of such galaxy cluster @xmath18modes in the context of providing thermal energy in ` cooling flow ' galaxy clusters .",
    "qin & wu ( 2001 ) proposed collisional interactions between baryons and heavy dmps ( @xmath19 with @xmath20 being the proton mass ) as a major nongravitational heating mechanism for icm in the core of a galaxy cluster .",
    "assuming dmps and baryons have comparable velocity dispersions , the kinetic energy of a single dmp would then be much larger than that of a baryon because of the presumed mass difference @xmath19 .",
    "therefore in numerous elastic collisions , kinetic energies of dmps can be systematically transferred to the baryonic icm to balance the radiative cooling in x - ray bands by hot electrons . by equating heating and cooling rates",
    ", they estimated a specific cross section of @xmath21 @xmath11 gev@xmath15 for @xmath22 .",
    "this is actually a requirement of compensating the radiation cooling and should not be regarded as a limit of any sort .",
    "it should also be noted that they took strong lensing cluster cl0024 + 1654 to infer the dmp - baryon interaction cross section for balancing the cooling , which may not be proper for the following reason .",
    "the significant discrepancy by a factor of @xmath23 between the mass profiles derived from x - ray observations and gravitational lensing effects shows that the icm may not be in a static equilibrium and might be still collapsing ( e.g. , kneib et al .",
    "2003 ; zhang et al . 2005 ) , and the bimodal velocity distribution of cluster galaxies indicates a merger of two systems with a mass ratio of @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( e.g. , czoske et al .",
    "the main heating mechanism of cl0024 + 1654 could well be the gravitational collapse .",
    "chuzhoy & nusser ( 2006 ) re - considered the icm heating scenario of qin & wu ( 2001 ) , corrected their calculations and derived a similar cross section for the heavy dmp - proton elastic collisional interaction .",
    "they found that , if @xmath1 is independent of the relative velocity @xmath26 of colliding particles , a thermal equilibrium state between heating by dmps and radiative cooling by hot electrons of icm would be always unstable .",
    "however , in galaxy clusters with @xmath27 kev , a stable energetic balance may be achieved for a relative velocity @xmath2dependent cross section @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "there are two major simplifications in both analyses of qin & wu ( 2001 ) and chuzhoy & nusser ( 2006 ) .",
    "first , they took the temperature and density of the icm and the density of dmps for typical values , rather than the relevant distributions determined by x - ray observations with high angular and spectral resolutions .",
    "secondly , they estimated the velocity dispersion of dmps either simply similar to that of baryons or by the results of numerical simulations , rather than a dynamically self - consistent ` true ' value obtained by solving the jeans equation ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; subramanian 2000 ; see also ikebe et al .",
    "2004 for the case of galaxy cluster a1795 ) . since the specific cross section limit they derived ( at the centre or at the virial radius ) is highly sensitive to the chosen parameters [ see equation ( 8) of qin & wu ( 2001 ) ] , it is crucial to investigate this icm heating mechanism more carefully using an actual sample of ` cooling flow ' galaxy clusters , well observed in x - ray bands by the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ satellites in space .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we set the upper limits for dmp - proton elastic collisional cross section per unit dmp mass . in  3 ,",
    "we demonstrate that the dmp - proton collisional interaction alone is unlikely to be a stable icm heating mechanism to compensate the radiative cooling of icm .",
    "discussion and conclusions are contained in  4 .",
    "details on the x - ray cooling function can be found in appendix a.    in our theoretical model consideration , we have adopted the currently favoured standard @xmath30cdm cosmology with the cosmological parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in conventional notations .",
    "the x - ray radiative cooling rate of the icm can be inferred observationally and may be approximately represented by the cooling function @xmath30 ( i.e. , radiative energy loss rate per unit volume ) in terms of temperature @xmath34 , baryon mass density @xmath35 and abundances @xmath36 of the icm as described in appendix a. the radiative ` cooling time ' @xmath37 of a galaxy cluster is then defined by ( e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) [ eq1 ] t_c|()^-1|=  , where @xmath38 is the icm internal energy per unit volume , @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath40 is the mean molecular weight of the icm , and @xmath20 is the proton mass .",
    "the cooling time @xmath41 is a function of radius @xmath42 in general . for ` cooling flow ' clusters , the estimated central cooling time is shorter than their cosmic age , or the hubble time @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the hubble constant .",
    "the so - called ` cooling radius ' @xmath45 is defined as the radius such that @xmath46 .",
    "the thermal conduction in icm across magnetic field may be negligible ( e.g. , cowie & binney 1977 ; stewart et al .",
    "1984 ; sarazin 1988 ; fabian 1994 ) due to small gyro - radii given by @xmath47 where @xmath48^{-1/2}$ ] is the relativistic lorentz factor , @xmath49 is the particle mass , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the particle velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the particle electric charge , and @xmath54 is the speed of light . for thermal electrons and an average @xmath55 in a typical icm , we estimate @xmath56 to be a few thousand kilometers .",
    "the central regions of ` cooling flow ' clusters will cool down substantially within a timescale of @xmath57 since their formation ; in the absence of other effective heating mechanisms to compensate the radiative loss in x - ray bands , the hot icm core would then collapse under self - gravity . although the icm behaviour in ` cooling flow ' clusters is inhomogeneous on smaller scales due to thermal instabilities ( e.g. , field 1965 ; mathews & bregman 1978 ; malagoli et al . 1990 ) , their main large - scale properties may be grossly modelled by smooth subsonic flows in a theoretical description ( e.g. , fabian et al . 1984 ) . assuming a quasi - spherical symmetry and a quasi - steady state , the icm evolution may be described by the following two equations ,",
    "namely , the mass conservation of baryons [ eq2 ] = 4_bvr^2and the energy conservation of baryons in icm ( see appendix b ) [ eq4 ] _ bv(h_b + + ) = -h  , where @xmath58 is the baryon mass accretion rate , the icm thermal pressure @xmath59 follows the ideal gas law , @xmath60 is the total gravitational potential ( including that of the dark matter halo ) , @xmath61 is the baryon kinetic energy per unit mass , and @xmath62 represents the possible heating function ( i.e. , the heating rate per unit baryon volume ) . the specific baryon enthalpy @xmath63 in energy conservation equation ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "is given by h_b =  , where the ratio of specific heats @xmath64 is taken to be @xmath65 for the icm .",
    "the estimated typical ` cooling flow ' speed @xmath66 is much less than the icm sound speed and thus @xmath61 is ignorable as compared to @xmath67 in energy equation ( [ eq4 ] ) .    we could have added a magnetic term @xmath68 within the parentheses on the left - hand side of energy equation ( [ eq4 ] ) with @xmath69 being the mean square of a completely random magnetic field @xmath70 transverse to the radial direction ( yu & lou 2005 ; yu et al .",
    "2006 ; wang & lou 2007 ; lou & wang 2007 ) .",
    "for a diffuse icm random magnetic field @xmath71 of strength @xmath72 g away from the core region ( e.g. , clarke et al .",
    "2001 ; carilli & taylor 2002 ) and a typical proton number density of @xmath73 ( e.g. , sarazin 1988 ; voit 2005 ) , we estimate a typical alfvn speed of @xmath74 much less than the icm sound speed",
    ". such a magnetic field strength may give rise to an anisotropic distribution of electrons but may not be significant in the sense of bulk flow dynamics . by the equipartition argument , a random magnetic field @xmath75 may reach strengths as strong as @xmath76 g in the icm core region of some galaxy clusters ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ; hu & lou 2004 ) . depending on the actual proton number density in the range of @xmath77 , magnetic pressure is less than ( e.g. , dolag & schindler 2000 ) or may be comparable to the thermal pressure in the core region for relaxed clusters of galaxies . for our main purpose of inferring the upper limit of dmp mass @xmath6 based on data of galaxy clusters , it suffices to examine the purely hydrodynamic case .",
    "now we consider the possible icm heating mechanism due to collisions between dmps and baryons . as usual , we assume maxwellian velocity distributions for both protons and dmps with ( one dimensional ) velocity dispersions @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively . for the case of @xmath26 independent cross section ,",
    "we have recalculated the energy transfer rate per unit volume through elastic collisions as [ transfer1 ] h=8 ^ 1/2 v_x^3_xp  , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the number densities of protons and dmps , respectively .",
    "for dmps much heavier than protons ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) and as @xmath82 in a gravitationally virialized system , the last factor in the form of a division on the right - hand side of equation ( [ transfer1 ] ) approaches unity .    for the case of @xmath26 dependent cross section @xmath1 , we take the case that the cross section has the form of a power law , namely @xmath83 . to avoid complicated calculations and as an example of illustration",
    ", we only consider the case of heavy dmps .",
    "adopting expression ( 9 ) of chuzhoy & nusser ( 2006 ) , we would then have [ transfer2 ] h62^a m_pn_pn_x v_x^3+av_0 ^ -a_0(1+v_p^2/v_x^2)^(1+a)/2 as an approximate heating function . in our model anaylsis ,",
    "the scattering cross section @xmath84 between a dmp and a proton is a free parameter to be constrained by several available x - ray observations of ` cooling flow ' galaxy clusters .",
    "the scattering cross section between dmps and helium nuclei @xmath85 is expected to be @xmath86 for incoherent scatterings , or @xmath87 for coherent scatterings , or 0 for the spin - dependent case ( e.g. , chen et al . 2002 ) . for simplicity , we shall take @xmath88 , noting that the other two alternatives would change the results only slightly .",
    "the mass density and temperature distributions of the icm can be inferred from x - ray observations independently .",
    "the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of icm protons is @xmath89 . under the approximations of quasi - spherical symmetry ,",
    "quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium and ideal gas law , the total enclosed cluster mass distribution obeys the following condition = - ( + )  , where @xmath90 is the total enclosed cluster mass ( dark matter and baryonic matter together ) inside radius @xmath42 , @xmath91 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the mass density of dmps can then be inferred from _",
    "x(r)= -_b(r )  .    in most model calculations for clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the dmp mass density distribution is fitted with the universal nfw mass profile obtained by numerical simulations ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) , namely [ nfwdensity ] _",
