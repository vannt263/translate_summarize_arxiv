    "this paper analyzes a retrial supermarket model with poisson arrivals , exponential service times and exponential retrial times and with two different probing - server numbers .",
    "it proposes a new analytic approach for discussing retrial queueing networks .",
    "this new approach is based on both differential equation approximation for markov chains and limiting structure for population processes , e.g. , see kurtz @xcite , wormald @xcite and darling and norris @xcite . a key result of this paper is an iterative algorithm for computing the fixed point , which is always important in the study of supermarket models . based on the fixed point",
    ", this paper uses numerical examples to indicate different influence of the two probing - server numbers on system performance including the fixed point and the expected sojourn time .",
    "recently , a number of companies ( e.g. , amazon , google etc . )",
    "are offering cloud computing service and cloud manufacturing technology .",
    "this motivates us to study efficient load balancing in large - scale networks with many computational and manufacturing resources .",
    "it is well - known that optimal task assignment is a key design issue when one can use different resources of large - scale networks . for such task assignment , there are two main approaches : push strategies and pull strategies .",
    "push strategies are mainly used in centralized systems , such as data centers allocate jobs to different processors ; while pull strategies are applied to send work from an overloaded processor to underloaded processors , or an underloaded resource will ask for work from overloaded resources . in the study of push strategies ,",
    "randomized load balancing is an important method , and specifically , retrial supermarket models provide a crucial task assignment mechanism in randomized load balancing schemes .",
    "randomized load balancing , where a job is assigned to a server from a small subset of randomly chosen servers , is very simple to implement .",
    "it has surprisingly good performance ( for example , reducing collisions , waiting times , backlogs ) in a number of applications , such as , data centers , hash tables , distributed memory machines , path selection in networks , and task assignment at web servers .",
    "supermarket models are extensively used to study randomized load balancing schemes . in the study of supermarket models , a key result by vvedenskaya , dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite indicated that when each poisson arriving job is assigned to the shortest one of @xmath0 randomly chosen queues with exponential service times , the equilibrium queue length can decay doubly exponentially in the limit as the population size @xmath1 .",
    "also , the stationary fraction of queues with at least @xmath2 customers is @xmath3 .",
    "this is a substantially performance improvement over the case for @xmath4 , where the tail of stationary queue length distribution in the corresponding m / m/1 queue is @xmath5 .",
    "further , such an exponential improvement is illustrated by li and lui @xcite for studying doubly exponential solution of the supermarket model with markovian arrival processes and phase - type service times , and by luczak and mcdiarmid @xcite for analyzing the maximum queue length in the supermarket model with poisson arrivals and exponential service times .    in the past ten years",
    ", supermarket models have been formulated by queueing theory as well as markov processes .",
    "much recurrent research dealt with the supermarket model with poisson arrival processes and exponential service times by means of density - dependent jump markov processes , which are applied to describe limiting behavior of the supermarket model as an infinite - size system of differential equations whose fixed point is doubly exponential .",
    "readers may refer to vvedenskaya , dobrushin and karpelevich @xcite and mitzenmacher @xcite .",
    "certain generalization of supermarket models has been explored in , for example , studying simple variations by vvedenskaya and suhov @xcite , mitzenmacher and vcking @xcite , mitzenmacher @xcite , azar , broder , karlin and upfal @xcite , vcking @xcite and mitzenmacher , richa , and sitaraman @xcite ; considering non - poisson arrivals or / and non - exponential service times by li , lui and wang @xcite , li and lui @xcite , bramson , lu and prabhakar @xcite and li @xcite ; discussing load information by mirchandaney , towsley , and stankovic @xcite , dahlin @xcite and mitzenmacher @xcite ; mathematical analysis by graham @xcite , luczak and norris @xcite and luczak and mcdiarmid @xcite ; using fast jackson networks by martin and suhov @xcite , martin @xcite and suhov and vvedenskaya @xcite .",
    "retrial queues are an important mathematical model for studying telephone switch systems , digital cellular mobile networks , computer networks and so on . during the last two decades",
    ", considerable attention has been paid to the study of retrial queues , for example , by survey papers of yang and templeton @xcite , falin @xcite , kulkarni and liang @xcite , artalejo @xcite and gmez - corral @xcite , and by three books of falin and templeton @xcite , artalejo and gmez - corral @xcite and li @xcite .",
    "note that the study of retrial queueing networks is difficult and challenging with few available results up to now , this paper proposes a novel approach for studying a class of important retrial queueing networks .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are threefold .",
    "the first one is to provide a novel approach to study a retrial supermarket model with poisson arrivals , exponential service times and exponential retrial times and with two different probing - server numbers .",
    "we describe the retrial supermarket model as a system of differential equations by means of density - dependent jump markov processes , and give an iterative algorithm for computing the fixed point which is shown to be super - exponential . the second one is to give an iterative algorithm for computing the expected sojourn time by means of the fixed point , and use numerical examples to illustrate different influence of the two probing - server numbers on system performance including the expected sojourn time .",
    "the third one is in analyzing exponential convergence of the current location of the retrial supermarket model to the fixed point .",
    "not only does the exponential convergence indicate existence of the fixed point , but it also explains that such a convergent process is very fast .",
    "furthermore , to study limiting behavior of the retrial supermarket model as its population size goes to infinity , we apply the kurtz theorem to study density - dependent jump markov process corresponding to the retrial supermarket model .",
    "this leads to a lipschitz condition under which the fraction measure of the retrial supermarket model weakly converges to the system of differential equations .",
    "different from previous works in the literature of retrial queues , this paper gives a more general analytical approach in the study of retrial queueing networks .",
    "we believe our approach can open a new door to performance evaluation of more complicated retrial queueing networks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe a retrial supermarket model with poisson arrivals , exponential service times and exponential retrial times and with two different probing - server numbers , and derive a system of differential equations based on density - dependent jump markov processes . in section 3",
    ", we provide an iterative algorithm for computing the fixed point of the system of differential equations , and show that the fixed point is super - exponential . in section 4 ,",
    "we provide an effective algorithm for computing the expected sojourn time , and use numerical examples to indicate different influence of the two probing - server numbers on system performance including the expected sojourn time . in section 5 , we study exponential convergence of the current location of the retrial supermarket model to the fixed point . in section 6",
    ", we apply the kurtz theorem to study density - dependent jump markov process corresponding to the retrial supermarket model , which leads to a lipschitz condition under which the fraction measure of the retrial supermarket model weakly converges to the system of differential equations .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "in this section , we describe a retrial supermarket model with poisson arrivals , exponential service times and exponential retrial times and with two different probing - server numbers , and derive a system of differential equations based on density - dependent jump markov processes .",
    "let us describe the retrial supermarket model .",
    "customers arrive at a queueing system of @xmath6 servers as a poisson process with arrival rate @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and the service times at each server are exponential with service rate @xmath9 .",
    "there is no waiting space before each server , but there is a total orbit of infinite size for all waiting customers .",
    "each primary arriving customer chooses @xmath10 servers independently and uniformly at random from the @xmath11 servers . if there is no customer in one of the @xmath12 chosen servers",
    ", then it enters the idle server immediately and receives service ; otherwise it enters the orbit and makes a retrial at a later time .",
    "each retrial arriving customer chooses @xmath13 servers independently and uniformly at random from the @xmath11 servers , if there is no customer in one of the @xmath14 chosen servers , then it enters the idle server immediately and receives service ; otherwise it enters the orbit again and makes a retrial at a later time .",
    "returning customers behave independently of each other and are persistent in the sense that they keep making retrials until they receive their requested service .",
    "successive inter - retrial times of each customer in the orbit are exponential with retrial rate @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that all the random variables defined above are independent of each other , and that this queueing system is operating in the region @xmath17 .",
    "in the retrial supermarket model , figure 1 provides physical structure of the retrial supermarket model , and figure 2 shows that each primary arriving customer and each retrial arriving customer can choose @xmath12 and @xmath14 servers independently and uniformly at random from the @xmath11 servers , respectively .",
    "we call @xmath12 and @xmath14 the two probing - server numbers . note that the two probing - server numbers have different influence on system performance including the fixed point and the expected sojourn time .         servers , respectively , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   servers , respectively , title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the following lemma , which is stated without proof , intuitively provides a sufficient condition under which the retrial supermarket model is stable . note that this proof can be given by a simple comparison argument with the queueing system in which each customer queues at a random server ( i.e. , where @xmath4 ) .",
    "when @xmath4 , each server acts like an m / m/1 retrial queue which is stable if @xmath18 , see falin and templeton @xcite or artalejo and gmez - corral @xcite .",
    "the comparison argument is similar to those in winston @xcite and weber @xcite , thus we obtain two useful results : ( 1 ) the shortest queue is optimal due to the assumptions on poisson arrivals , exponential service times and exponential retrial times ; and ( 2 ) the size of the longest queue in the retrial supermarket model is stochastically dominated by the size of the longest queue in a set of @xmath11 independent m / m/1 retrial queues .    for the retrial supermarket model with poisson arrivals , exponential service times and exponential retrial times and with two different probing - server numbers ,",
    "it is stable if @xmath19    for @xmath20 , we denote by @xmath21 the numbers of busy servers  with at least @xmath2 customers in the orbit at time @xmath22 , and @xmath23 the numbers of idle servers with at least @xmath2 customers in the orbit  at time @xmath22 . clearly , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath20 .    for @xmath20",

    "we write@xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 and@xmath46 let @xmath47 .",
    "then it is easy to see from the poisson arrivals , the exponential service times and the exponential retrial times that @xmath48 is also a markov process whose state space is given by@xmath49 if the initial distribution of the markov process @xmath50 approaches the dirac delta - measure concentrated at a point @xmath51 @xmath52 , then @xmath53 is concentrated on the trajectory @xmath54 .",
    "this indicates a law of large numbers for the time evolution of the fractions of busy servers and of idle servers .",
    "furthermore , the markov process @xmath40 converges weakly to the fraction vector @xmath55 as the population size @xmath1 , or for a sufficiently small @xmath56,@xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath59-norm of vector @xmath60 .",
