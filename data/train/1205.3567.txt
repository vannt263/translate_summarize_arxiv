    "along with the successful run of lhc at 8tev , many researchers now are anxiously waiting judgment on whether the 125gev possible excess displayed by atlas and cms experiments is the standard model ( sm ) higgs or some other particle(s ) or just a statistical fluctuation .",
    "if before the end of 2012 the excess is shown either not to be the sm higgs or just to disappear as more data accumulates , the sm higgs then will be simply ignored by the lhc experiments .",
    "this will be a very cheering result , since it offers the strongest direct experiment proof that the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism predicted by sm is not correct and new physics beyond sm is needed , despite any discovery of new physics yet .",
    "particle physics will enter a golden age full of excitements with prospects from various investigation ventures and potential discoveries of predicted or unexpected new physics .",
    "however , if by the end of this year , data from the atlas and cms experiments support the discovery of the sm higgs , sm then may become a perfect model not only theoretically but also experimentally . while celebrating the great success ,",
    "one disadvantage that particle physicists avoid talking about , emerges more and more realistically , i.e. , no new physics appears . some have shown that , with the 125gev higgs , sm survives all the way to the planck scale@xcite .",
    "particle physics in this scenario then has a bleak future without new phenomena emerging , apart from those predicted by sm .",
    "the conventional basis of unclear electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism that new physics searchers relied on may no longer exist .",
    "there are two different schemes to deal with this bad situation .",
    "the first is to insist on searching new physics in electroweak symmetry breaking sector of sm and it is already taken by many researchers . considering that the final verification of sm higgs will need many years of further experimental effort , along with ever - increasing amounts of data from the experiment",
    ", one can gradually narrow various higgs couplings to ordinary quarks , leptons and gauge bosons to their sm values to examine the possible left new physics spaces @xcite .",
    "the second is that we propose and emphasize in this paper . assuming the 125gev access is exactly sm higgs , we search new physics evidence in alternative fields instead of continuously precision check of the higgs profile .",
    "two apparent such facts are the existence of dark matter predicted from cosmology and massive neutrinos from their oscillation experiments . however",
    ", dark matter maybe only participates in gravitational interactions and a simple generalization of sm can introduce neutrino masses .",
    "these two evidences are not strong enough to ensure the existence of non - trivial new physics . to raise hopes for a future for those new physics believers",
    ", we have to find some extra evidence or clues requiring new physics .",
    "we know that sm fits experiments very well up to now ; based on present experimental data , we do not have strong evidence for new physics .",
    "we need to lower expectations to investigate effects that are not so strong .",
    "conventionally , the veracity of sm is tested by precision measurements in the electroweak sector .",
    "a well - known scheme is the global electroweak sm fit in which a series of observables at the z - pole and off z - pole are chosen to fit experiment results with theoretical predictions by tuning the input parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and other quantities which are irrelevant for this work .",
    "the complete global fit for z - pole observables in @xcite shows that the deviation of electroweak observables is smaller than 1@xmath11 .",
    "the exceptions are following seven observables : @xmath1 with 2.7@xmath11 , @xmath2 with 1.8@xmath11 , @xmath12 with 1.8@xmath11 , @xmath13 with 1.5@xmath11 , @xmath14 with 1.5@xmath11 , @xmath15 with 1.4@xmath11 , and @xmath16 with 1.3@xmath11 . in latest improved results with gfitter @xcite , there are still seven observables with the deviation of more than 1@xmath11 , especially @xmath1 and @xmath17 with the deviation of more than 2@xmath11 .",
    "since this is already the best fit of sm which leads unknown higgs mass @xmath18gev , any further variation of @xmath19 will worsen the result .",
    "this can be further seen from @xmath19 dependence of separate fitting for above five observables .",
    "gfitter shows that @xmath1 and @xmath20 prefer smaller while @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 prefer larger @xmath19 .",
    "so within sm itself , no matter what value of @xmath19 , it is impossible to further improve the present global electroweak sm fitting result . if we insist on reducing the deviation values for these observables , the only way is to add in new physics . in this sense ,",
    "the moderately large deviations in the global electroweak sm fit are the evidences that we seek re - demonstrate the existence of new physics",
    ". improving global electroweak sm fits can then provide a measure to judge the new physics models .    in the literature",
    ", we do not find many works treating the global electroweak sm fits in this way .",
    "one possible reason is that the deviation of the fit is not so large , and researchers have turned their attention to other observables , such as the oblique parameters @xmath7 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite , especially @xmath7 which often gives very strong constraints on new physics models .",
    "in fact , many years ago , when @xmath26 received a very large deviation @xcite , much work appeared trying to explain the result in terms of various new physics models .",
    "along with improvements in experimental results , the deviation in @xmath26 was reduced over time ; researchers were then no longer interested in those kinds of discussions .",
    "now , assuming that the sm higgs is confirmed , what we want to do is to re - initiate the investigation in this direction . with this application of global electroweak fitting to new physics models in mind",
    ", we examine below the simplest abelian extension of sm that can be used as an example of the new physics beyond sm . in this scenario , the conventional sm gauge group @xmath27",
    "is extended to @xmath28 .",
    "the neutral heavy gauge boson associated with the extra broken @xmath29 group is usually called the @xmath3 boson , assumed here to be the lightest new physics particle beyond sm .",
    "many new physics models have one such @xmath3 boson ( for details see ref.@xcite ) as a remnant of new physics interactions . for this paper , we take @xmath3 as a simplest case of new physics to study its effects on the global electroweak fit .",
    "we find three references in the literature that investigated such effects of a @xmath3 particle @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the author performed a complete electroweak fits to z extensions of sm and pointed out that presence of @xmath3 may solve @xmath30 anomaly problem .",
    "in ref.@xcite , it was shown that a @xmath3 based on gauged @xmath31 lepton number can improve the fit for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the author claimed that a @xmath3 , with suppressed couplings to the electron compared to the @xmath0 boson and couplings to the @xmath32 quark , provides an excellent fit to @xmath1 and @xmath2 and significant improvements in @xmath22 and @xmath26 at @xmath332gev scale . to make a relatively large contribution ,",
    "the @xmath3 mass was fitted close to @xmath0 boson mass , otherwise the contribution from @xmath3 exchange vanishes unless @xmath3 is near the @xmath0-pole .",
    "in ref.@xcite , only the simplest @xmath34 mixing was considered , while in the analysis of refs.@xcite , effect from @xmath35 mixing was ignored .",
    "this is ok for the fittings for those observables out of z - pole , where mixing effect is small .",
    "but for the z - pole observables we focused in this paper , fitting result is sensitive to the @xmath35 mixings . to avoid the unnatural @xmath3 mass near @xmath10 and include in important @xmath35 mixing effect",
    ", we consider the most general model - independent @xmath3 boson described by an electroweak chiral lagrangian given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in fact , from an effective field theory point of view , all coefficients appearing in the electroweak chiral lagrangian @xcite are free parameters which need to be fixed either from experiments or from underlying theoretical models .",
    "our global fit can be seen as a kind of procedure to extract out experiment constraints on these coefficients .",
    "in contrast to ref.@xcite , in this fit the @xmath3 mass needs not to close to z - pole due to some extra free parameters not fixed by the global fit .",
    "direct exchange at the @xmath0-pole discussed in ref.@xcite then becomes enough small to be neglected in our work .",
    "other @xmath3 bosons effects include modifications of @xmath0 couplings through @xmath35 mixings and @xmath3 couplings to sm fermions .",
    "they are the main sources to cause the change . in next section",
    ", we will discuss how to manipulate them and obtain our improved global electroweak fitting result .",
    "this is the main part of the paper",
    ". we will first discuss @xmath35 mixings and @xmath3 couplings to sm fermions separately , then describe our global fitting procedure .",
    "finally give our fitting result and make some discussions .",
    "for @xmath3 mixings with electroweak neutral bosons @xmath0 and @xmath4 , usually a lighter @xmath3 is possible at larger mixing angles ; smaller mixing angles arise only for heavier @xmath3 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "more detailed results depend on the form of the mixings set by the models . considering that the experimental constraint for the @xmath3 mass has already reached the tev energy region ,",
    "we assume here a small mixing ( order of @xmath36 ) @xmath3 . based on a model independent chiral lagrangian , we have already classified and parameterized the most general @xmath35 mixings in ref.@xcite . to include in @xmath3 mixings effects ,",
    "we define the rotation matrix between the gauge eigenstates of the neutral gauge bosons of @xmath37 and the corresponding mass eigenstates as follows : @xmath38 with weinberg angle @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "after rotation by @xmath25 , the neutral gauge fields will be diagonalized into their mass eigenstates .    for the @xmath3 coupling to sm fermions , we need to determine the @xmath29 charge assignments of the sm fermions .",
    "these are related to following neutral current interactions @xmath41 where @xmath42,@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the respective @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath29 gauge coupling constants and @xmath47f_i \\nonumber\\\\ j^\\mu_x&=&\\sum_i\\bar{f}_i\\gamma^\\mu[y'_{il}p_l+y'_{ir}p_r]f_i\\label{jxdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are neutral currents corresponding respectively to the third component gauge boson @xmath48 of weak isospin , hypercharge gauge boson @xmath49 and an extra @xmath29 gauge boson @xmath50 . in addition , @xmath51 are the left / right - handed @xmath29 charges for the sm fermion field @xmath52 with flavor index @xmath53 ; the electroweak gauge symmetry @xmath45 constrains these to eighteen charges in the most general case : three left - handed quark charges for each of the three generations @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ; six right - handed quark charges for each quark @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ; three left - handed lepton charges for each generation @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ; and six right - handed lepton charges for each leptons @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 . in the mass eigenstates basis ,",
    "the neutral currents become @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the renormalized electric charge incorporating @xmath3 contributions and @xmath74 . for the rotation matrix ( [ umatrix ] ) , the neutral currents in the mass eigenstates basis are related to those in the interaction eigenstates basis as : @xmath75 to keep the gauge symmetry , the assignments of the charges must satisfy the anomaly cancelation conditions .",
    "a generation independent solution has been discussed in our previous paper @xcite , in which only two charges are free due to cancelations of @xmath76 ^ 2u(1)'$ ] , @xmath77 ^ 2u(1)'$ ] , @xmath78 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath79 ^ 2u(1)'$ ] , @xmath80 ^ 3 $ ] and the mixing gravitational - gauge anomalies . to obtain the most general fitting result , we focused on making general generation dependent charge assignments .",
    "considering that some charges are very small in the fitting result , we further discuss a case in which these small charges vanish . in all , two cases arise :    1 .",
    "the anomaly cancels only when all three generations are included .",
    "we find that there are twelve free charges .",
    "2 .   within case 1",
    ", we further stipulate that the charges for the second - generation quarks , the first - generation left - handed lepton , and right - handed electron vanish , i.e. @xmath81 . six free charges exist .",
    "to simplify the fitting procedure and give prominence to our physical result , we performed a global electroweak fit by fixing the sm contribution with its predictions given by pdg2010 @xcite , and only investigated the possible @xmath3 tree order contributions . a more subtle alternative fit without fixing sm contributions , which will need more complex sm computations , will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "to realize this simplified global electroweak fit , we took three precisely measured observables , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as input parameters with which to express the three sm three parameters : @xmath42 , @xmath43 and electroweak vacuum expectation value @xmath82 in the sm lagrangian .",
    "other sm parameters , such as fermion masses @xmath83 , higgs mass @xmath84 , and strong coupling constant @xmath85 , are irrelevant in the fit to fix sm contributions .    at tree level , we fix @xmath9 .",
    "the fine structure constant @xmath86 and z boson mass @xmath10 are corrected by modifications including the respective contributions to @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 with vacuum expectation value @xmath90 and @xmath0 mass @xmath91 in sm .",
    "an electroweak observable @xmath92 , depending on @xmath9 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , can be divided into two parts : one is @xmath95 coming from sm fitting values in @xcite and depending on @xmath9 and sm @xmath8 and @xmath10 , and the other is @xmath96 coming from a @xmath3 correction depending on mixing parameters @xmath97 introduced in ( [ umatrix ] ) , sm fermion @xmath29 charges @xmath98 and constrained by the anomaly cancelation condition , i.e. , @xmath99 note , some of @xmath97 such as @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 do not enter into the formulae to those z - pole electroweak observables .",
    "therefore these @xmath97s are irrelevant to our global fit and we will not discuss their values in this paper . the difference between the present experimental data and sm fitting results will provide a narrow space for the @xmath3 correction @xmath104 .",
    "we solve for the minimum of @xmath105 function @xmath106 by tuning @xmath97 and @xmath98 to obtain our global electroweak fitting results , the smaller the @xmath105 , the better the results .",
    "here , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are experimental values and errors , respectively .",
    "we consider all @xmath0-pole observables listed in @xcite and @xcite ; their definitions and expressions at @xmath0-pole appear in the literature @xcite .",
    "the fitting result on the mixing parameters and sm fermion @xmath29 charges is given in table.[tab : parameters ] .",
    ".fitting result on the mixing parameters @xmath97 and sm fermion @xmath29 charges in @xmath3 effective theory . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the value of sm @xmath105 is @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 is not decided by fit independently .",
    "@xmath111 is the coefficient of @xmath112)^2 $ ] in chiral effective theory given in ref.@xcite .",
    "it comes from the relation @xmath113 to keep photon massless .",
    "the global fit result is given in fig.[fig.pull ] .",
    "pull ]    we see that the best fit is case 1 , for which the largest two deviations in sm fit , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are obviously reduced .",
    "the largest two deviations in case 1 is 1.2@xmath11 for @xmath2 and 1.1@xmath11 for @xmath114 , and deviations for other observables are below @xmath115 .",
    "this implies that the global fit of the electroweak observables does support case 1 .",
    "the @xmath3 mass can not be fixed in our fit due to following relation @xmath116\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath117gev and the coefficient @xmath118 of the term @xmath119)^2 $ ] in chiral effective theory @xcite . due to the undetermined parameters @xmath44 , @xmath101 , @xmath103 , and @xmath111",
    ", @xmath120 keeps free in our result .",
    "note heavy @xmath3 with @xmath121 leads large negative @xmath111 for small couplings @xmath44 and small mixing parameters @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "considering that case 1 predicts that some charges take very small values , we annul these charges by further assuming in case 2 null charges for the second - generation quarks , the first - generation left - handed lepton , and right - handed electron . for case 2 ,",
    "the largest deviation is still @xmath6 for @xmath114 with @xmath105 value of @xmath122 and we find relatively large couplings to the third generation which is matched with result of ref.@xcite .",
    "of course , one can continuing annulling more charges , but we find then either the absolute value of the largest deviation is larger than @xmath123half of the largest deviation for sm , or we may have @xmath3 mixings of order @xmath124 .",
    "we drop these cases anymore , because in further loosening the deviation value , the largest absolute value becomes @xmath5 signifying that all charges vanish and we have just reverted to sm .",
    "large @xmath3 mixings may yield light @xmath3 @xcite or contradict with electroweak precision data .",
    "it should be noted that the mixing parameters @xmath97 used in this paper are not and usually are larger than the conventional mixing angle used in literature .",

    "then the order of @xmath130 is @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath36 for @xmath133 10tev , 1tev and @xmath134gev respectively . and",
    "in case 1 and 2 the numerator of ( [ theta ] ) @xmath135 $ ] always is @xmath136 , which just matches our fitting results given in table.[tab : parameters ] .    except the magnitudes for the mixing parameters @xmath97 , in case 2 , there appear some null charges which implies that @xmath3 does not couple to the corresponding fermions .",
    "the implications of these decouplings on the new physics model building need further investigations .    with the above global fitting results",
    ", we can further check effects on the oblique parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the experiments prefer small negative values , whereas many unsuccessful new physics models contribute it positive corrections .",
    "thus we have a test for our global fit . the @xmath3 correction contribution to @xmath7",
    "is @xmath137\\label{s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for which we find a contribution of @xmath138 for case 1 and @xmath139 for case 2 .",
    "i.e. , our fitting result does push @xmath7 parameter to its experiment preferred negative region .",
    "to summarize , we pointed out and emphasized that even if lhc experiments would confirm sm higgs , the global electroweak fit always implies the existence of new physics . mixing of a hypothetical @xmath3 with @xmath0 and @xmath4 at order of @xmath36 and couples to sm fermions with suitable anomaly free charge assignments will really improve global fitting results .",
    "it can change @xmath105 substantially from @xmath109 of sm to @xmath140 , reduce the largest deviation from @xmath5 in sm to @xmath6 in our scenario , suppress all observables below @xmath115 except @xmath2 and @xmath114 , and make @xmath3 extra contributions to the oblique parameter @xmath7 to @xmath138 .",
    "global electroweak fits do not prefer @xmath3 couplings to the second - generation quarks , the first - generation left - handed lepton , and right - handed electron .",
    "our global fit is done for z - pole observables which is sensitive to @xmath35 mixing and leads typical correction at order of @xmath36 .",
    "this is only the part of the most general global fitting program which includes the fits for both z - pole and off z - pole observables , but any of new physics models must at least match z - pole observables .",
    "usually the new particles beyond sm are heavier than @xmath10 , which implies that their exchange effects at z - pole are small .",
    "to more detail analyze , the correction is at most at order of @xmath141 , with typical new physics particle mass @xmath142 at order of 1tev .",
    "this is one order of magnitude smaller than the correction from our @xmath35 mixing .",
    "therefore if there are not enough big mixings among new physics particles and sm electroweak gauge particles , we can not expect generally sufficient large improvements on global electroweak fit at z - pole from exchange of new physics particles . among various new physics particles ,",
    "the most important particle which mixes with the sm electroweak gauge particle is @xmath3 .",
    "the other possible charged vector particles @xmath143 are less important due to their relative simple mixings with @xmath144 , ref.@xcite gives the simliar result .",
    "further the loop correction from these new physics particles usually suppressed by loop factor @xmath145 which may be at the same order of our @xmath35 mixing depending on the detail value of coupling of the loop . for the global fit coming from the loop corrections of new physics particles and from those observables off the z - pole scale , we will leave the our corresponding discussions in future investigations .",
