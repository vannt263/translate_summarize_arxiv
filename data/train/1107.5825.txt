    "star formation begins with the collapse of an interstellar cloud core to form a protostar , which grows from infall of envelope material and later through an accretion disk , where planets may form .",
    "this physical evolution from cores to planetary systems is accompanied by a chemical evolution , which will affect planet and planetesimal compositions .",
    "much of this chemical evolution takes place in icy mantles on interstellar grain surfaces , and the aim of this paper is to consolidate the knowledge of ice evolution during star formation coming out of the _ spitzer _ space telescope mission .",
    "the first ices were detected in the interstellar medium almost 40 years ago @xcite and from previous work , mostly toward high - mass protostars , h@xmath1o , co and co@xmath1 ices are known to be common during the cold and dense stages of star formation , with abundances reaching 10@xmath6 @xmath7 .",

    "ch@xmath2oh and other ices are proposed sources of complex organic molecules @xcite and determining ice abundances and production channels in star forming regions is therefore of great interest for studies of prebiotic chemistry .",
    "most ices except for co are predicted to form _ in situ _ on interstellar grain surfaces through hydrogenation and oxygenation of atoms and small molecules @xcite .",
    "heat and uv radiation from protostars may result in additional ice processing and @xcite suggested that some co@xmath1 ice , and all ch@xmath2oh and xcn ice form through such processing based on observations toward high - mass protostars with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) .",
    "this has been challenged by observations of abundant ch@xmath2oh and xcn ice toward low - mass protostars @xcite , where ices are protected from strong uv fields during most of their life time .",

    "the contributions of the derived components are then used to characterize the spectral bands in all sources in the sample .",

    "when calculating the km estimate the detections and upper limits are ordered from low to high and the upper limits are given the values of the nearest lower detections .",

    "quartiles are favored over standard deviations since most ice abundances do not follow a normal distribution ( see below ) . for the species where the kaplan - meier estimate is @xmath1520% lower than the detection - based median , both are listed .",
    "co and co@xmath1 are the most abundant ices after h@xmath1o , with low - mass protostellar median abundances of 29% with respect to h@xmath1o .",

    "testing whether perceived differences between low- and high - mass protostars are significant requires an investigation of the ice abundance distributions within each sample of protostars , however , and this is done in  3.4 after presenting ice abundance variations toward low - mass protostars in  3.3 .",
    "ice abundance variations between different sources depend on how sensitive the ice formation and destruction pathways are to the local environment . investigating protostellar abundance variations thus puts constraints on when and where different ices form ( variations are not dominated by reported abundance uncertainties from fitting the observed spectra ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] demonstrates that some ice abundance distributions are skewed with a high - abundance tail .",
    "all abundance histograms are therefore log - transformed and then centered on the median detected low - mass protostellar ice abundance , with bin sizes proportional to the low - mass abundance variances . for ices",

    "appendix c contains figures that compare the distributions with and without upper limits included .",
    "differences between low- and high - mass protostellar abundances are discussed further below , while this section focuses on the larger low - mass sample .",
    "since ice abundances are with respect to h@xmath1o , a small variation of a species indicates co - formation with h@xmath1o , while large ice abundance variations are indicative of different formation and/or destruction dependencies than h@xmath1o ice .",

    "the pure co and co@xmath1 ice components have the broadest distributions , consistent with their expected dependence on the protostellar envelope temperature for ice evaporation and segregation .",
    "the 57 @xmath8 m components , c15 , span the full range of variations observed among the identified ice components , including the previously noted narrow c3 distribution ( paper i ) .    protostellar ice heating was explored in paper i and ii as explanations for observed abundance variations , using pure co / co : h@xmath1o and pure co@xmath1/co@xmath1:h@xmath1o as diagnostics of the amount of moderate ice heating , and h@xmath1o / silicate as a probe of complete ice sublimation .",
    "correlations between h@xmath1o / silicate and the different c1 - 5 components are extensively discussed in paper i and by @xcite for protostars and background stars .",
    "the main conclusion was that c3/c4 does depend on ice sublimation , supporting its identification with low- and high - temperature nh@xmath13 salts .",
    "moderate ice heating is predicted to reduce the abundances of volatile ices ( decreasing the pure co abundance ) , segregate previous ice mixtures ( resulting in pure co@xmath1 ) , drive ice crystallization , activate acid - base chemistry and cause diffusion of ice radicals and thus the formation of more complex species .",
    "none of the ice abundances in this study are however correlated with either ice temperature tracer ( not shown ) except for the previously found c5/h@xmath1o correlation with pure co / co : h@xmath1o ( paper i ) .",
    "moderate ( transient ) ice heating alone seems to play a minor role in simple ice formation .",
    "this result does not exclude that the combined differences in temperature and uv radiation around low- and high - mass protostars results in different ice chemistries . whether this is",
    "the case is the topic of next section .",
    "figures [ fig4][fig6 ] show that many ices are similarly distributed toward low- and high - mass protostars , but as noted in  3.2 , the total co@xmath1 , co and ch@xmath3 abundances are lower toward the high - mass sources .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] reveals that the difference in co@xmath1 abundances between low - mass and high - mass stars is due to a difference in the co@xmath1:h@xmath1o ice component , which typically dominate the spectra toward low - mass sources ( paper ii ) .",

    "no trend with distance to the core center is seen for any other ice component and is also not expected for ices forming early during cloud formation ( e.g. ch@xmath3 and nh@xmath2 ) , which are independent of cloud core time scales and co freeze - out , or of species dependent on protostellar heating ( e.g. pure co@xmath1 ice ) or of components with potentially multiple carriers , such as the c1 - 5 bands .",
    "ch@xmath2oh is only detected toward one of the sources and no trend can thus be extracted .",

    "the h@xmath1o column density has been shown to correlate well with dust extinction , assumed to trace the total dust mass and h@xmath1 column @xcite .",
    "this implies that the average abundance of h@xmath1o ice per dust grain is constant across the core . in an arbitrary line of sight ,",

    "third , while the 9.7 @xmath8 m band correlates well with the near - infrared color excess , the relations vary in different environments by factors of 2 @xcite , possibly because of variations in the grain size distribution or even variations in the grain composition @xcite . and",
    "fifth , the contribution of unrelated , ice - less foreground dust is often unknown .",
    "there are no significant positive correlations ( at the 95% confidence level ) between h@xmath1o and any ice abundance , x / h@xmath1o , when applying spearman s rank correlation test @xcite to the low - mass protostellar sample ; rank correlation tests are more robust to outliers compared to most parametric correlation tests and make no assumptions about whether the correlation is linear or non - linear .",

    "c4 has been associated with nh@xmath13 salts and its anti - correlation with h@xmath1o may be explained by an increasing salt fraction with ice sublimation because salts have higher sublimation temperatures than h@xmath1o ice ( paper i ) .",

    "these correlations are indicative of a co - related , single carrier of the entire xcn band with a spectral profile that depends on the environment .",
    "the simplest explanation is that ocn@xmath10 is responsible for the entire xcn band ( i.e. both the ocn@xmath10 component and the 2175 @xmath11 component ) and that the two components are due to ocn@xmath10 in a volatile ( co - rich ) ice toward some sources , and in a different ice mixture in warm environments .",

    ", the amount of o and c found in the ices approaches the abundances of non - refractory o and c ( table [ tab : con ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that additional o and n may be hidden in the ice in the form of o@xmath1 and n@xmath1 .",
    "direct constraints on o@xmath1 ice abundances are high , 50100% with respect to co ice , and constraints from o@xmath1 interactions with co ice are of a similar order @xcite .",
    "o@xmath1 ice is , however , unlikely to be abundant from the low upper limits on o@xmath1 in the gas - phase ; it is orders of magnitude less abundant than co and since the two molecules have similar freeze - out and desorption properties it is unlikely that o@xmath1 is differently partitioned between ice and gas compared to co @xcite .      toward low- and high - mass protostars alike ,",
    "the ices are dominated by h@xmath1o , followed by co@xmath1 and co (  3.2 ) .",
    "c and o are expected to react similarly with hydrogen .",
    "the low abundance of ch@xmath3 therefore implies that most c is not in atomic form when the bulk of the h@xmath1o ice is forming from o early in cloud formation or at low extinctions ( region 1 . in fig .",

    "the bulk of h@xmath1o formation is instead associated with continuous formation of co@xmath1 , probably from co+oh @xcite ; the co@xmath1:h@xmath1o abundance barely varies from source to source in the low - mass protostellar sample (  3.3 ) . h@xmath1o and co@xmath1 ice mapping confirms this scenario @xcite , as do the similar co@xmath1 abundances toward cloud cores and protostars (  3.5 ) .",
    "most co that is frozen out in this phase must be converted into co@xmath1 .    from its small abundance variations , nh@xmath2 is also inferred to form early with h@xmath1o (  3.3 ) .",
    "the c3 component may be associated with this stage as well and its identification with nh@xmath13 suggests that there exists a large amount of strong acids that can protonate nh@xmath2 in cold ices @xcite .",
    "anions are notoriously difficult to observe in the ice , however , and thus gas phase observations of non - thermally evaporated ices at the edges of clouds probably offer the best opportunity to confirm their existence .",
    "it is promising that hcooh has been detected toward translucent clouds @xcite and a more comprehensive study focusing on gas - phase hcooh and other acids toward cloud edges , where ice formation has began and photodesorption is efficient , is warranted .    at some point",
    "the co / o ratio becomes large enough that most frozen - out co is no longer converted into co@xmath1 and h@xmath1o is no longer the most efficiently formed ice .",
    "we mark this as the breaking point between early h@xmath1o dominated and late co - driven pre - stellar ice formation .",
    "the ices that form in this later stage ( region 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) are not expected to co - vary with h@xmath1o , but rather depend on the co - freeze - out efficiency .",
    "the latter is both temperature and density dependent and may vary greatly dependent on cloud structure , cloud collapse time scales and local radiation environment .",
    "this explains why many identified ice and ice components that are definitely present during the pre - stellar stage ( e.g. ch@xmath2oh ) have abundances that vary by orders of magnitude with respect to h@xmath1o (  3.3,3.5 ) both locally in a single core and when comparing different cloud complexes .",
    "in addition , the anti - correlation between h@xmath1o ice and the abundance of several co - ice components suggest that the time available for this co - based chemistry decreases when a longer time is spent in the h@xmath1o - ice formation stage , where o is converted into h@xmath1o and co@xmath1:h@xmath1o ice (  3.7 ) .    co@xmath1:co , co : h@xmath1o and the ocn@xmath10 feature are all associated with this co - ice chemistry (  3.5 ) .",
    "co@xmath1:co correlates with co freeze - out in the oph - f ice map , demonstrating a second , later production pathway of co@xmath1 .",
    "co@xmath1 may still form from oh+co , but at later stages co is more abundant than o , resulting in sparse h@xmath1o formation compared to co and thus in a co - rich co@xmath1 ice ( see * ? ? ? * for a similar discussion from a theoretical point of view ) . from the correlation studies in  3.7",
    ", ocn@xmath10 seems to similarly require co freeze - out and may form from co+nh , followed by proton transfer .",

    "ices are continuously exposed to cosmic rays and cosmic - ray induced uv photons @xcite and other ` late ' ice features may also depend on cosmic - rays , directly or indirectly . in general , observed ice features can however be explained by an early ice chemistry phase characteristic of hydrogenation of atoms , followed by atom - addition reactions in a co dominated ice phase .      though much of the observed ice evolution can be explained by prestellar processes ,",
    "some ice features are formed or destroyed by the protostar .",
    "the broadest ice distributions belong to pure co@xmath1 and pure co ice (  3.3 ) , whose variations are best explained by protostellar heating evaporating co ice and distilling or segregating co@xmath1-containing ices ( paper ii * ? ? ?",
    "this last and most source dependent ice chemistry phase is also predicted to result in complex ice formation that requires ice heating for diffusion of large radicals @xcite . while the spectra observed to date",
    "do not allow for definitive assignments to any specific complex species , the presence of e.g. a feature at 7.25  @xmath8 m belonging either to hcooh or ch@xmath2ch@xmath1oh , demonstrates that some complex organic ices are forming efficiently in the pre- or protostellar stage .",
    "most of the observed differences between low and high - mass protostars can be explained by protostellar ice heating (  3.4 ) .",
    "co is comparatively volatile and its low abundances toward high - mass sources is consistent with their higher envelope temperatures .",
    "the co : h@xmath1o contents toward low and high mass objects are comparable , consistent with experiments that show that 510% of co can be trapped in h@xmath1o ice up to the h@xmath1o evaporation temperature @xcite .    the low co@xmath1:h@xmath1o abundances toward high - mass protostars can also be explained by thermal ice processing .",
    "this component starts to segregate above 30  k resulting in a pure co@xmath1 ice component , which desorbs above 50  k. the luminosity of the star will determine the radii for ice segregation and desorption and the extent of the 3050  k shell where pure co@xmath1 ice will be common . toward low - luminosity stars",
    "the segregation and desorption radii will be closer to the star resulting in more unprocessed ice along the line of sight and thus more co@xmath1:h@xmath1o as compared to high - mass ysos .",
    "an alternative explanation for the low co@xmath1:h@xmath1o fraction toward high - mass stars is different cloud formation time scales and temperature structures during low and high mass star formation .",
    "recent work by @xcite shows that the switchover between co@xmath1:h@xmath1o and co@xmath1:co ice formation depends on temperature and different cloud temperature structures toward low- and high - mass forming clouds may account for the observed differences .",
    "the high co@xmath1 abundances toward the small sample of low - mass protostars in a high - radiation region ( ic 1396a ) seems more consistent with the protostellar processing scenario , however .    in the low - mass protostellar sample",
    "there is no correlation between pure co@xmath1 ice abundance and the total envelope mass as traced by h@xmath1o ice (  3.7.1 ) .",
    "there is thus no evidence that variations in pure co@xmath1 fractions can be explained by variable envelope sizes ( toward high - mass protostars , envelope temperatures and sizes anti - correlate , see * ? ? ?",
    "rather large amounts of pure co@xmath1 toward some low - mass protostars may be a remnant of past luminosity outbursts that heated up the envelope beyond its low - accretion temperature , since ice segregation is an irreversible process @xcite .",
    "episodic accretion resulting in luminosity outbursts has been invoked to explain the luminosity problem of low - mass ysos , i.e. the observation that most ysos are significantly less luminous than predicted by protostellar evolutionary models with steady accretion @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for a higher ch@xmath2oh or ocn@xmath10 content toward high - mass stars , except for the cases of overabundant ocn@xmath10 toward w33a and very abundant ch@xmath2oh toward gl7009s @xcite ; thus neither species seems to require stellar uv irradiation or thermal processing to form at typical abundances .",
    "the composition of the xcn band varies on average between low- and high - mass objects , but as discussed above the carrier is probably dominated by ocn@xmath10 in both cases . of the remaining ice components c4 and c5 seem to have higher abundances toward the high - mass protostars , indicative of at least a partial formation pathway involving heat or uv irradiation or both , in agreement with the analysis in paper i. still , most ice abundances are remarkably similar around low- and high - mass protostars , high - lighting the importance of the cold , protected stages for ice formation up to the complexity of ch@xmath2oh",
    "this is also the conclusion in @xcite .",
    "the protostellar stage includes the formation of an accretion disk , which is the formation site of planetesimals and eventually planets .",
    "these disks are observed to have cold midplanes , where ices should be abundant .",
    "it is often difficult to study these disk ices directly because of confusion between disk ices and ices in foreground clouds @xcite .",
    "comets in our own solar system should , however , carry a record of the ice composition in one such disk midplane .",
    "it is unknown whether cometary ices reformed in the disk or whether they are at least partly pre - solar or protosolar ; recent models suggest that much of the original ice will in fact survive accretion from the envelope into the disk @xcite .",
    "even if cometary ices originate from protosolar ices , the protostellar and protosolar ice abundance populations are not expected to overlap perfectly , since the comets originate around a single star , whereas the spread in protostellar ices show the differences in ice abundances between different protostars .",
    "assuming that the protosun resembled one of the observed protostars , what can be addressed is the question of whether comet ice abundances are consistent with a protosolar origin or whether additional ice chemistry in the protosolar nebula is required to account for the observed abundances . in light of this , figure [ fig12 ] shows a comparison between cometary and low - mass protostellar ch@xmath2oh , ch@xmath3 and co abundances with respect to h@xmath1o ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for all three ices , the cometary abundances are well below the median protostellar abundances .",
    "if the observed cometary ices are pre - solar , this comparison implies either that the ice composition in the protosolar envelope was similar to the most carbon - poor ices observed in the protostellar sample , or that some ice abundances with respect to h@xmath1o were reduced in the solar nebula .",
    "possible selective ice destruction processes include desorption of the most volatile ices and uv induced chemistry .",
    "the spread in cometary ice abundances is comparable to the spread found between _ different _ protostellar sources , suggestive either of a primordial variation in ice abundances within the protosolar envelope or of ice processing in the solar nebula , or a combination of the two .",
    "once a sample of cometary co@xmath1 ice abundances become available , the dominant source of variation should be possible to constrain , since co@xmath1 ice abundances vary little in the protostellar stage .",
    "already , however , the low ch@xmath3 abundances do suggest significant ice destruction during the disk stage , through chemistry or selective desorption .",
    "similarly , comets are known to be significantly depleted in nitrogen , and the small number of comets with directly measured nh@xmath2/h@xmath1o ratios reveal a loss of nh@xmath2 compared to low mass protostars ( * ? ? ?",

    "large samples of ice sources spanning diverse environments , evolutionary stages and luminosities are necessary both to determine ` typical ' ice abundances and to identify how ice processes depend on their environment .",
    "the main findings from combining the @xmath0 and other ice surveys carried out in a homogenous way are listed below :    1 .   the co and co@xmath1 abundance medians relative to h@xmath1o are both @xmath1229% toward low - mass ysos , while ch@xmath3 , nh@xmath2 and ch@xmath2oh are more than a factor of five less abundant .",
