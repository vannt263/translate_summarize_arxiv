    "in recent years , usage of wireless devices such as smart phones , and laptops has grown exponentially .",
    "a major concern over this growth is that a large number of wireless devices are now trying to access limited wireless spectrum .",
    "further spectrum measurement campaigns have shown that the fixed spectrum assignment policy for wireless devices has resulted in under utilization of the allotted bandwidth @xcite . hence , to solve this problem and to have better spectrum utilization ,",
    "researchers have proposed the technique of cognitive radio network ( crn ) . in crn ,",
    "the licensed bands are made available to unlicensed users , also called as secondary users ( sus ) whenever the licensed or primary user ( pu ) are not using the spectrum . in crn ,",
    "the channel sensing parameters of the sus such as sensing time , sensing interval , and sensing accuracy have an impact on the performance of both secondary and primary network .",
    "many works in literature @xcite and references therein have studied the effect of phy and mac layer sensing parameters on the throughput of the secondary network .",
    "most of these papers have assumed the on and off time distribution of channel occupancy of the pu to be exponential .",
    "however , an in - depth analysis of spectrum measurement traces reveals that the idle times of ism and gsm bands exhibit power law decay till some critical time after which it has exponential decay @xcite , @xcite . by power law decay , we mean that the log - log plot of probability density function @xmath0 of channel idle times , given by @xmath1 , will be a straight line with negative slope @xmath2 . the data sets with above behavior",
    "have been shown to be well modeled with hyper - exponential distribution ( he d ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "similarly , sharma  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have simulated 802.11 wlan clients - server model in opnet simulator and have observed that the channel idle times can be modeled using he d distribution .",
    "the authors of @xcite and @xcite have proposed an optimal su sensing / transmission strategy to maximize the throughput of su with constraint on pu packet collision for generalized as well as hyper - exponential pu idle time distributions .",
    "many of the existing works have made the unrealistic assumption that sus have full - duplex capability .",
    "a full duplex su can transmit signal and detect the reappearance of pu at the same time .",
    "however , the design of full - duplex system with acceptable pu detection probability is highly complex .",
    "further , it increases the energy consumption of the su .",
    "a promising use - case scenario of secondary network is the wireless sensor network wherein it is not cost effective to deploy full - duplex su . considering the practical difficulties in implementing full - duplex su , we look at the design of opportunistic secondary network that has half - duplex capability . in a full - duplex system",
    "the su can stop its transmission as soon as the pu is detected .",
    "thus the interference to pu can be kept minimal ( maximum of one pu packet as a result of packet header corruption ) .",
    "however in the case of half - duplex system the interference of su with pu is in general more than that of full - duplex case and can be as large as the inter - sensing duration .",
    "thus the problem of finding optimal sensing strategy becomes even more crucial in the half - duplex system .    the major contribution of our work which differs from the existing literature on channel sensing strategies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in crn are as follows : in contrast to @xcite , we model pu off times as he d which is more realistic . secondly , we have designed an optimal channel sensing interval framework considering half - duplex sus whereas @xcite , @xcite have assumed full - duplex sus .",
    "finally , we frame optimization problem that tries to minimise both the cost for number of channel sensing and the cost of interference to pu by choosing optimal channel sensing intervals .",
    "we have used dynamic programming to derive the optimal channel sensing interval policy in our work .",
    "interest readers can look into @xcite on applying dynamic programming to other optimization problems in crn .",
    "the important insight of our work is that the constant periodic sensing policy is not an optimal solution for non - exponential pu off times .",
    "we have proved the above point by deducing the structure of optimal solution using markov decision process ( mdp ) .",
    "we further suggest a new sub - optimal policy called  multishot sensing interval policy \" which outperforms existing sub - optimal channel sensing policies in the literature @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : a brief overview of system model is given in section  [ sec : sys_model ] . in section",
    "[ sec : opt_formulation ] , we formulate the optimization problem which balances the number of su channel sensing and interference to pu .",
    "the structure of optimal solution is derived using mdp in section  [ sec : mdp ] . in section  [ sec : suboptimal ] , the different sub - optimal channel sensing interval policies are proposed . section  [ sec : simulation ] compares the performance of sub - optimal policies under various channel traffic conditions through simulation .",

    "we consider crn having half - duplex sus . following the studies on spectrum measurement traces ,",
    "we model the off time distribution of pu to be heavy tailed .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the heavy - tailed idle times ( off times ) of pu are well - modeled as k - phase he d distribution , @xmath3 where @xmath4 s are the phase probabilities such that @xmath5 , and @xmath6 s are the rates of mixture of exponential distribution @xcite .",
    "is said to follow he d if x is , with probability @xmath4 , exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath6 for @xmath7 . ]",
    "the realistic spectrum measurement traces can be used to estimate the parameters @xmath4 s and @xmath6 s of he d as shown in @xcite .",
    "suppose the su sense the channel to be free from the primary user and occupies it .",
    "let @xmath8 be the time at which su occupies the channel .",

    "the residual pu off time at @xmath19 sensing instant , @xmath20 , also has he d distribution with same @xmath21 but with different @xmath4 s .",
    "for example , the phase probabilities of residual pu off time @xmath22 at first sensing instant @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , ... , @xmath26 , can be calculated as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is given as @xmath29 in general , the phase probabilities at @xmath19 sensing instant @xmath30 are given by @xmath31 which can be rewritten as @xmath32 let @xmath33 denote the cost per channel sensing .",
