    "during summer 2013 a preliminary waveform analysis was performed using two readout electronics systems , acqiris dc282 and wasa , to investigate their precision in measuring the collected charge by the devices using several types of amplifier configurations and different amount of injected charge .",

    "also , some discrepancy in the extracted adc resolution of few percents was observed when using different experimental setups .",
    "being the results preliminary , no further investigation was done on the source of this systematical uncertainty , although the measurements suggest a dependence on the correct adc calibration in the wasa ; this feature should , in principle , be a minor issue , due to the possibility to perform that calibration in a more controlled and stable experimental setup .",
    "quite interesting is the use of a new transimpedance amplifier with differential output in order to minimize , when locating the device close to the current source , the signal distorption when picking up noise from neighbouring instrumentation in an experimental hall like frm - ii .",
    "this device in the used experimental test - bench setup showed a linear response well below @xmath24 .",
    "as next evaluation , it is forseen to use the new transimpedence amplifier in single - ended mode in combination with the available 16 input channel acqiris daq crate ( which processes signals in single - ended mode ) to run a new anger camera prototype ( already built at zea-2 ) , based on scintillating plates , and made of 4x4 vacuum photomultipliers r268 by hamamatsu .",
    "the measurements will be made initially with the neutron @xmath68 source availabe in our laboratory , and the results will be published as soon as they will be available .",
    "the results presented in this work should ensure the possibility to use the wasa system in the waveform analysis , expecially in the case of need to build and run the anger camera with a larger spatial coverage and input channels , being the wasa crate ( by wiener  @xcite ) capable to host up to @xmath66 readout modules ( plus the interface module to the external computer ) , resulting theoretically in @xmath69 readout channels .",
