    "the experimental realization of strongly correlated systems with ultracold gases loaded in optical lattices @xcite has generated tremendous excitement during recent years .",
    "initially thought of as a way to simulate condensed matter model hamiltonians , like the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , loading atoms on optical lattices has enabled the creation of quantum systems that are unexpected in the condensed matter context . among these systems",
    "the realization of bose - fermi mixtures in optical lattices @xcite , where the inter- and intra - species interactions can be tuned to be attractive or repulsive @xcite , is a remarkable example of the scope of realizable models .",
    "theoretical studies of bose - fermi mixtures in one - dimensional lattices have been done for homogeneous @xcite and trapped @xcite systems .",
    "several approaches have been used : gutzwiller mean - field theory @xcite , strong coupling expansions @xcite , bosonization @xcite and exact analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies .",
    "recently , a mixture of bosonic atoms and molecules on a lattice was studied numerically @xcite .",
    "the landscape of phases encountered is expansive , and includes mott insulators , spin and charge density waves , a variety of superfluids , phase separation , and wigner crystals .",
    "however , the phase diagram in the chemical potential - interaction strength plane has not yet been reported .",
    "it is our goal in this paper to present a study of repulsive bose - fermi mixtures in one - dimensional lattices that generalizes previous studies , which focused on specific special densities , to more general filling . after mapping the phase diagram we will explore different sections in greater detail . since the particular case in which the lattice is half filled with bosons and half filled with fermions has been carefully studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will instead concentrate here on two cases : ( i ) when the number of bosons is commensurate with the lattice size but the number of fermions is not , and ( ii ) when the sum of both species is commensurate with the lattice size but the number of bosons and fermions are different . some of the phases present in these cases have been identified by sengupta and pryadko in their grand canonical study in ref .",

    "the hamiltonian of bose - fermi mixtures in one dimension can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the boson creation ( destruction ) operators on site @xmath2 of the one - dimensional lattice with @xmath3 sites .",
    "similarly , @xmath4 are the creation ( destruction ) operators on site @xmath2 for spinless fermions on the same lattice . for these creation and destruction operators @xmath5 are the associated number operators .",
    "the bosonic and fermionic hopping parameters are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , and the on - site boson - boson and boson - fermion interactions by @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this paper",
    "we will consider the case @xmath10 ( i.e.  when the boson and fermion hopping integrals are equal ) and choose @xmath11 to set the scale of energy .",

    "therefore the associated chemical potential @xmath15 is small .",
    "what happens when @xmath16 exceeds @xmath17 depends on the relative strength of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is less than @xmath18 then the extra bosons sit atop of the fermions and @xmath15 jumps by @xmath9 .",
    "the chemical potential stays at this elevated value of @xmath9 until all the sites with fermions also have a boson . at that point",
    "additional bosons start going onto sites with a boson already , and @xmath15 jumps to @xmath18 .",
    "thus in general there are incompressible phases where the boson chemical potential jumps both at commensurate @xmath19 ( as for the pure boson - hubbard model ) and also at @xmath20 . for @xmath9",
    "greater than @xmath18 and less than @xmath21 the incompressible phases still start at @xmath22 but the following potential jumps are shifted up by @xmath23 . turning on the hoppings @xmath24 introduces quantum fluctuations which will ultimately destroy these mott plateaus and introduce new , intricate phases .",
    "we perform quantum monte carlo simulations ( qmc ) using a recently proposed canonical worm algorithm @xcite .",
    "this approach makes use of global moves to update the configurations , samples the winding number , and gives access to the measurement of @xmath25-body green functions .",
    "it also has the useful property of working in the _ canonical _ ensemble .",
    "this is particularly important for the present application since working with two species of particles leads to two different chemical potentials in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "these prove difficult to adjust such that the precise , desired fillings are achieved . in our canonical simulations",
    "the bose and fermi occupations are exactly specified and the chemical potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27 are instead computed @xcite via appropriate numerical derivatives of the resultant ground state energy ( e.g.  @xmath28 ) .    the canonical worm algorithm is a variation of the prokofev _ et  al._grand - canonical worm algorithm @xcite . within the canonical worm approach one",
