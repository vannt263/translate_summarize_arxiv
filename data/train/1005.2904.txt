    "symmetry plays an important role in our understanding of nature and is the primary ingredient that goes into shaping of physical laws .",
    "symmetry dictates the dynamics in nature @xcite .",
    "this simple _ and _ powerful insight has shaped our current knowledge of physics , right from the galilean invariance of newtonian mechanics , through the lorentz invariance of special relativity , to the reparametrization or diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity .",
    "so understanding the role and systematic construction of symmetries through their generators is an important aspect in the study of any physical theory .    given an action ,",
    "a symmetry is some transformation of the fields of the theory involving arbitrary functions of time that leaves the action off - shell invariant .",
    "rotations and translations in global space - time consist two important examples of such symmetries that are observed in nature .",
    "together , these operations constitute the poincar group .",
    "to implement this poincar symmetry at the local level , whereby arbitrary functions of time and space are involved in the variations , new fields must be introduced which compensate for terms in the action not remaining invariant under this localization . these additional fields then are shown to represent the gravitational fields and the theory which describes this procedure and the corresponding dynamics is known as the poincar gauge theory ( hereafter referred to as pgt ) @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has been done since then till recent times studying various aspects of the theory .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the symmetries involved in pgt are motivated and derived by considering changes occurring due to local lorentz rotations and infinitesimal coordinate changes ( i.e. diffeomorphism ) . however , no canonical procedure of generating this symmetry through a set of generators exists till now .",
    "this problem was initially addressed in @xcite by computing the hamiltonian ( gauss ) generator following the approach of @xcite .",
    "however the off - shell symmetries that were obtained as a result , were different from the pgt symmetries .",
    "the two sets matched only on - shell .",
    "this mismatch was thought to be a consequence of the approach @xcite which , strictly speaking , is not a completely off - shell approach .",
    "recently , an attempt to remedy this situation was given in @xcite .",
    "a systematic and completely off - shell analysis of this issue was done in 2 + 1 dimensions , taking the 3d gravity model with torsion ( modelled on the mielke - baekler action @xcite ) and the dirac hamiltonian generator was computed . alas",
    ", the original conclusions of @xcite remained unaltered . here in this article , we adopt a totally different ( lagrangian ) approach and show how to systematically construct generators of the pgt symmetries .",
    "the symmetries obtained from these generators reproduce the pgt symmetries without using any equations of motion .",
    "the task of finding the symmetries of a given action is , in general , not trivial .",
    "they can not always be found on inspection , as is possible , say , in electrodynamics .",
    "there exist two approaches to systematically construct the symmetries inbuilt in a given action ; the hamiltonian approach and the lagrangian approach . in the hamiltonian approach @xcite ,",
    "one first undertakes the dirac classification of all constraints into first - class and second - class .",
    "then the generators of the symmetries are obtained as some suitable combination of first - class constraints containing time derivatives of arbitrary functions .",
    "the poisson bracket of the fields with these generators give us the symmetries as transformations .",
    "the lagrangian method @xcite , on the other hand , hinges on the condition that the existence of symmetries necessarily implies the existence of certain identities involving quantities given by variations of the action w.r.t .",
    "the basic fields  the euler derivatives .",
    "the lagrangian generators can then be found through comparison with the general expressions of such identities derived from a theory involving general symmetry transformation of fields in terms of arbitrary functions of time .",
    "we have used this later method of constructing generators here , after modifying it suitably for our model with vielbeins and connections as basic fields , that are written both in holonomic ( global coordinate ) and an - holonomic ( local coordinate ) indices .",
    "having constructed the generators first in 2 + 1 dimensions , we then repeat the process in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the construction of symmetries through the hamiltonian approach in 3 + 1 dimensions itself is a very difficult task and pure dirac analysis and classification of constraints is non - trivial for , say , just the einstein - cartan theory .",
    "however it is shown that the lagrangian version can be carried out more easily , leading to a systematic derivation of the symmetries even in 3 + 1 dimensions . to do this ,",
    "we first lift the gauge identities corresponding to pgt symmetries from 2 + 1 to 3 + 1 dimensions and then carry out the lagrangian analysis . however , at the end of the day , the symmetries obtained are the same as that found by directly lifting the 2 + 1 pgt symmetries in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this shows that the pgt symmetries , arising out of geometrical considerations of reparametrization and local lorentz symmetry , are beautifully consistent and useful in an extended sense .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : genform ]",
    "we give a general formulation of the lagrangian method to find out generators , starting from known gauge identities of a model .",
    "next , in section [ sec:2 + 1laggen ] , we identify the gauge identities , calculate the generators in 2 + 1 dimensions and thus systematically reproduce the pgt symmetries in a mielke - baekler type model in 2 + 1 dimensions . for finding symmetry generators in 3 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "we then lift the 2 + 1 dimensional gauge identities to 3 + 1 in section [ sec:3 + 1laggen ] and find out the lagrangian generators .",
    "these are shown to generate the usual pgt symmetries in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "subsequently , we also demonstrate that the 2 + 1 dimensional generators , when stripped of their dimension dependant form containing dual fields , have the same form as in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this suggests that our results may be extrapolated to any higher dimensions .",
    "the whole scheme is summarized in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclu ] .",
    "besides this , we have also included [ sec : appuseslaggen ] , where we comment on other possible applications of lagrangian generators .

    "the lagrangian method of finding generators was employed , and in the case of first - order formulations of gravity , was seen to be much simpler than its hamiltonian counterpart . to begin with",
    ", we took a 2 + 1 dimensional model of a pgt - invariant lagrangian which has been of recent interest @xcite  the 3d gravity model with torsion and a cosmological term .",
    "the starting gauge identities involving the euler derivatives that were required for the lagrangian analysis , were taken from a recent analysis @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian generators were subsequently computed and pgt symmetries were recovered using the same .",

    "finding the generators that yield the pgt symmetries systematically , through a canonical method , was necessary to put this much studied symmetry at a firm level as it was not even known whether it was possible to generate the pgt symmetries by a canonical and completely off - shell process . a recent attempt @xcite to generate the symmetries of a pgt invariant 2 + 1 dimensional mielke - baekler @xcite type model through pure dirac hamiltonian generator construction in a completely off - shell manner ( following @xcite ) had given symmetries which were distinctly different from pgt symmetries .",

    "in particular , the _ off - shell _ poincar gauge theory symmetries were reproduced through lagrangian generators for the 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensional mielke baekler type models of gravity .",
    "one might wonder about other possible applications of these generators . in this appendix",
    "we briefly comment on the issue .",
    "as is well known , the canonical generators derived in the hamiltonian formalism , apart from yielding the gauge symmetries , are also used to find the conserved charges and central terms in the poisson algebra of spacetime symmetries @xcite .",
    "since the hamiltonian and lagrangian formulations complement one another , it is expected that the lagrangian generators will also have a similar , though not necessarily identical , role .",
    "we now elaborate on this and related points .    the crucial ingredient in abstracting the lagrangian generators are the gauge identities .",
    "construction of these identities can be made from physical considerations .",
    "however , there also exist systematic schemes for arriving at these gauge identities from algorithms employing lagrangian constraints @xcite .",
    "so , given a model with some lagrangian , we can arrive at the gauge identities and the lagrangian generators systematically .",
    "now , some insight into these identities is gleaned from their connection with the bianchi identities of a model @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we adopt the einstein - hilbert action in 3 + 1 dimensions for the demonstration of this connection .",
    "the calculation follows @xcite closely .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action in 3 + 1 dimensions is written in terms of the basic field @xmath113  the metric  as : @xmath114 where the ricci tensor @xmath115 is defined in terms of the christoffel connections @xmath116 in the usual way as in einstein general relativity : @xmath117 varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath113 we get the euler derivative @xmath118 @xmath119 where , @xmath120 invariance of the action leads to the usual einstein s equation @xmath121 .",
    "the gauge identity may be subsequently defined as @xmath122 which may also be expressed as , @xmath123 now , the bianchi identity for einstein general relativity is well known and is written in terms of the riemann tensor @xmath124 as : @xmath125 contracting @xmath126 with @xmath127 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 in the above identity ( the metricity condition @xmath130 holds in einstein general relativity ) , we reproduce the gauge identity .",
    "this immediately shows that the gauge identity is nothing but a suitably contracted form of the bianchi identity in this model .    the gauge identity , or the contracted version of the bianchi identity , plays a significant role in the obtention of the noether central charges .",
    "as in the hamiltonian description , here too surface terms are important . if these terms are not dropped , then takes the form , @xmath131.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] explicitly using @xmath132 we obtain , @xmath133 = 0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in the integrand vanishes due to the gauge identity .",
    "this also implies the vanishing of the second term in the integrand .",
    "effectively , this leads to the covariant conservation of the noether current , @xmath134 corresponding to each vector @xmath39 it is now possible to construct a conserved noether charge from .",
    "this yields the standard komar s integral in general relativity @xcite",
    ".    a comment on the surface terms might be useful . in the hamiltonian approach ,",
    "these terms are determined by requiring the functional differentiability of the generators .",
    "the corresponding criterion in the present lagrangian formulation is to retain all surface terms in the variation of the action under a general coordinate transformation , eventually leading to the gauge identity .",
    "this is clearly manifested in where the first term in the integrand yields the gauge identity while the second is the cherished surface term .",
    "we thus observe how the gauge identity , which is directly connected with the lagrangian generators , leads to conserved noether charges .",
