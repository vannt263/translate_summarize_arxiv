    "photons in optical microcavities can strongly couple to excitons and form new quasi - particles : exciton - polaritons or simply polaritons @xcite .",
    "these unique half - light half - matter states exhibit rich physical properties and attract great interest from condensed matter and optics communities . inheriting a light effective mass from its photon component ,",
    "microcavity polaritons demonstrate high temperature bose - einstein condensation @xcite and superfluidity @xcite . at the same time , due to their excitonic component , microcavity polaritons interact much stronger than pure photons in typical photonic setups , and thus represent a competitive and promising platform for ultrafast signal processing applications .",
    "indeed , a range of fundamental nonlinear effects has been investigated with microcavity polaritons , including low threshold bistability @xcite , polarization multi - stability and switching @xcite , parametric scattering and pattern formation @xcite , excitation of dark- @xcite and brigth solitons @xcite .",
    "the existence of dark solitons is supported by the combination of the positive effective mass of polaritons with low momenta in the cavity plane , and the repulsive nonlinear interaction of polaritons .",
    "the two factors jointly ensure stability of a high amplitude background , which forms the tails of a dark soliton @xcite . in planar systems , such as polariton microcavities , these conditions also favor formation of vortices , and the two types of solutions- dark solitons and vortices , often coexist @xcite . in particular , vortices can emerge as the result of a transverse instability development of a dark soliton @xcite . spontaneous parametric scattering can also lead to formation of various types of rotating and stationary vortex - antivortex lattice arrangements in microcavities @xcite .",
    "excitation of vortices can be triggered by perturbations , such as an external pulse or polariton condensate scattering by an obstacle @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism underlines similarities of polariton dynamics in microcavities with hydrodynamics of super - fluids @xcite .",
    "the analogy has been further developed in the recent theoretical and experimental studies of hydrodynamical properties of vortices and dark solitons in polariton condensates @xcite . despite the above analogies with hydrodynamics and optics , polariton solitons and vortices have an important distinctive feature : they are inherently two - component states , and the effective masses of the photonic and excitonic components differ by many orders of magnitude .",
    "the fact that there are two components is somewhat obscured , when polaritons are described by a single order parameter function , but in this work we demonstrate that there are easily accessible regimes and solutions , where this approach breaks down .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that the dual - component nature of micro - cavity polaritons leads to the existence of the _ novel type _ of dark solitons and vortices which have no analogues in hydrodynamics , nonlinear optics and dynamics of atomic bose - einstein condensates .",
    "such solutions emerge as the result of the specific type of bistability of the system - so called _ intrinsic bistability_. this phenomenon has been known for sometime , though very rarely investigated , and it refers to the situation when material polarisation is bistable in the presence of a constant applied field @xcite . in our system , the intrinsic bistability manifests in multiple solutions of the excitonic wave function for a given amplitude of the intracavity electric field .",
    "we show that the intrinsic bistability provides the new and unique mechanism for localization of nonlinear excitations .",
    "we coin such solutions _ dual - core _ vortices and solitons .",
    "recently it was noted that polariton vortices have two distinctive characteristic lengths of localization ( healing lengths ) in the photonic and excitonic components @xcite .",
    "however , vortices and dark solitons reported in that work can be described within the framework of the polaritonic order parameter equation of the gross - pitaevskii type , and exist outside the parameter range where the intrinsic bistability and our solutions are possible .",
    "we also note here the analogy with abrikosov vortices in superconductors of the second type placed in magnetic field @xcite .",
    "abrikosov vortices have two very different scales : the so - called london length , which is the relatively large characteristic scale of the localization of magnetic field , and the coherence length , which is the small characteristic length of the variation of the superconducting electrons density .",
    "we adopt the well established dimensionless mean - field model describing dynamics of the exciton polariton condensate in an optical cavity @xcite in terms of coupled complex amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the photon and exciton fields : @xmath2 where time is measured in the units of the inverse rabi frequency @xmath3 , scaling of spatial coordinates @xmath4 is determined by the effective cavity photon mass @xmath5 : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the attenuation coefficients for the photon and exciton fields , respectively , @xmath9 is the detuning between the exciton resonance and the cavity resonance , @xmath10 is the coefficient describing the diffraction of the exciton field ( relative to the diffraction of photons ) : @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the exciton mass , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the amplitude and the detuning of the pump from the center of the gap between lower- and upper polaritonic branches . the coefficient of nonlinear interaction in the excitonic field is set to unity by the appropriate scaling of field amplitudes , see more details in ref .",

    "the homogeneous solution is linearly stable in @xmath37 and @xmath39 domains .",

    "then , eq .  ( [ 2d_stat_equiv ] ) is equivalent to the equation describing dynamics of a particle in a potential : @xmath45 where coordinate @xmath46 plays the role of the effective `` time '' , and the potential is given by : @xmath47 in the derivation of eq .",

    "[ fig_1_1 ] . approaching the boundary between @xmath37 and @xmath39 domains , this ratio gradually reduces , but remains non - zero everywhere inside @xmath37 domain , thus confirming that the soliton has a discontinuity of the @xmath22 field in its core .    crossing the boundary between @xmath37 and @xmath39 domains , the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath21 becomes unique ( no intrinsic bistability ) .",
    "inside @xmath39 domain , the potential @xmath72 and the corresponding phase plane now have three fixed points : the centre point at @xmath73 and two saddles at @xmath74 . in this domain , usual dark solitons @xcite ,",
