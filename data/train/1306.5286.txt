    "richness of solutions is a typical feature of nonlinear problems . since",
    "a complete characterization of a vast set of all solutions usually is not possible , a simpler problem of classification of admissible _ types _ of solutions of a nonlinear system becomes a relevant and still nontrivial task . in this respect",
    ", there is an important distinction between conservative and non - conservative ( i.e. dissipative ) systems .",
    "conservative nonlinear systems typically possess continuous _ families _ of nonlinear stationary solutions ( modes ) which exist for fixed values of the system parameters .",
    "a family of nonlinear modes can be parametrized by an `` internal '' quantity ( or few quantities ) , like , for instance , @xmath1-norm of the mode ( which can correspond to energy , number of particles , or total power , depending on the particular physical statement ) or its frequency ( i.e. propagation constant or chemical potential ) .",
    "the situation becomes different when one considers a dissipative system characterized by the presence of gain and losses . in order to admit a stationary solution ,",
    "such a system requires the absorbed energy to be compensated exactly by the gain .",
    "the requirement of energy balance imposes an additional constraint on the shape of the solution which has to have a nontrivial energy flow allowing for the energy transfer from the gain regions to the lossy ones . as a result , for",
    "given values of the system parameters , a typical dissipative nonlinear system does not admit continuous families of nonlinear modes .",
    "instead , isolated nonlinear modes appear . from the dynamical point of view",
    ", these isolated modes typically behave as attractors ( being stable ) or repellers ( being unstable ) . in order to obtain a continuous set of physically distinct dissipative nonlinear modes ,",
    "one has to vary parameters of the system , i.e. change the system itself .",
    "then , instead of continuous families , characteristic for conservative systems with fixed parameters , the dissipative system admits continuous _ branches _ of nonlinear modes which are obtained through variation of the system parameters .",
    "we thus distinguish between parametric families and branches .",
    "the described dichotomy is particularly well - known in the context of the discussion of dissipative solitons _",
    "vs. _ conventional solitons in the nonlinear schrdinger - like and complex ginzburg ",
    "landau equations  @xcite .    in this context , the physical concept of parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry  @xcite deserves a particular attention .",
    "this is because the nonlinear systems with @xmath0 symmetry appear to occupy an `` intermediate position '' between the conventional conservative and dissipative systems .",
    "whereas the systems governed by a @xmath0-symmetric operators are of dissipative nature and require a solution to generate a nontrivial energy flow in order to maintain itself , the exact gain and loss balance inherent to the @xmath0 symmetry allows for the system to possess in some cases continuous families of nonlinear modes apart from the branches typical to dissipative systems .",
    "there are numerous studies where both branches and families of the nonlinear modes in @xmath0-symmetric systems have been reported .",
    "in particular , exact solutions were reported for the nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric dimer ( a system of two coupled nonlinear oscillators ) in  @xcite .",
    "families of nonlinear discrete modes received particular emphasis in @xcite , while branches of the solutions were obtained for finite lattices like @xmath0-symmetric trimers and oligomers @xcite , as well as for infinite @xmath0-symmetric chains @xcite .",
    "localized modes ( or solitons ) are also known to exist in extended nonlinear systems , where they first were found in the presence of a periodic @xmath0-symmetric potential and cubic nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "families of nonlinear modes in continuous systems were intensively investigated for gap solitons in kerr  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite media , in @xmath0-symmetric parabolic potential  @xcite , in defect @xmath0-symmetric lattices  @xcite , in systems with @xmath3 nonlinearity with embedded @xmath0-symmetric defect  @xcite , and in the presence of a @xmath0-symmetric superlattice  @xcite .",
    "lattices with @xmath0-symmetric _ nonlinear _ potentials were proposed in  @xcite .",
    "combined effect of linear and nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric lattices was explored in discrete  @xcite and continuous  @xcite statements .",
    "models of two coupled waveguides ( so - called @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear couplers ) are also known to support solitons @xcite and breathers @xcite .",
    "solitons in a system consisting of a necklace of optical @xmath0-symmetric waveguides were recently addressed in  @xcite .    in the most of the mentioned studies ,",
    "the nonlinearity inherent to the system was fixed by the physical statement of the problem . in optical applications one usually considers the cubic ( namely , kerr type ) or quadratic ( @xmath2-type ) nonlinearities , while realization of @xmath0 symmetry bose - einstein condensates @xcite also implies the kerr type nonlinearity . in many situations ,",
    "however , the nonlinearity can be changed , which makes it relevant to study physical systems obeying the same linear properties but having nonlinearities of different types . in particular",
    ", we will study bifurcations of families of nonlinear modes from the eigenstates of the underlying linear operator ( i.e. the operator describing the linear part of the system ) and argue that the bifurcations are possible only if the nonlinear operator admits a certain symmetry which can be conveniently referred to as _ weak _ @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this terminology is to emphasize that the class of weakly @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear operators contains as a subset a class of @xmath0-symmetric nonlinear operators which ( by analogy with the definition of @xmath0 symmetry for linear operators ) commute with the @xmath0 operator .",
    "the _ second  goal _ of our paper is to study relevance of @xmath0-symmetric nonlinearities for dynamical properties of the system .",
    "in particular , we will study possibilities for the nonlinear system ( [ dyn_main ] ) to admit integrals of motion and show that if the nonlinearity is @xmath0 symmetric ( and has a certain additional simple property ) , then the nonlinear system does admit an integral of motion . on the other hand",
    ", we will also argue that integrals of motion can exist if the nonlinear operator is pseudo - hermitian @xcite .",
    "apart from the type of nonlinearity , properties of the nonlinear modes may strongly depend on the character of the spectrum of the underlying linear operator .",
    "most of the above mentioned studies dealt with the situations when the linear spectrum consists of simple real eigenvalues .",
    "recently , nonlinear modes bifurcating from the doubly degenerate linear eigenstates were reported in  @xcite . for both those cases we develop formal asymptotical expansions which describe bifurcations of the nonlinear modes from degenerate linear eigenstates . in order to construct the expansions",
    ", we explore the structure of the invariant subspace associated with the multiple eigenvalue . for the case of a semi - simple eigenvalue",
    ", we show that its invariant subspace can be spanned by a basis consisting of @xmath0-invariant linearly independent eigenvectors ( see proposition  1 ) .",
    "for the situation when the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvector is less than its algebraic multiplicity , we show that there exists a @xmath0-invariant generalized eigenvector ( proposition  2 ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] we specify the chosen model and make some general remarks related to the subject .",
    "next , we address the effect of the nonlinearity on bifurcation of nonlinear modes from the eigenstates of the linear lattice .",
    "we consider the essentially different situations of bifurcations from simple ( sec .",
    "[ sec : simple ] ) and ( sec .",
    "[ sec : semisimple ] ) eigenvalues , as well as the nonlinear modes in the presence of the exceptional point singularity ( sec .  [",
    "sec : exc ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : intergral ] we address the question about the nonlinearities allowing nonlinear @xmath0-symmetric systems to have integrals of motion .",
    "the outcomes are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "to proceed with our studies , we specify the chosen model . in the present work ,",
    "we study a nonlinear system of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a column - vector of @xmath6 elements , an overdot stands for the derivative with respect to time @xmath7 ( or with respect to the propagation distance in optical terminology ) .",
    "the linear part of the finite lattice ( [ dyn_main ] ) is described by a @xmath8 symmetric matrix @xmath9 .",
    "we consider @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians @xmath9 @xcite , meaning that there exist parity , @xmath10 , and time - reversal , @xmath11 , operators such that @xmath12 , @xmath13=0 $ ] and @xmath14=0 $ ]    as it is customary , we define the time reversal operator @xmath11 by the complex conjugation , i.e. @xmath15 ( hereafter an asterisk stands for the complex conjugation ) , and consider @xmath10 to be a matrix representation of the linear parity reversal operator .",
    "the above definition of @xmath11 ensures that entries of the matrix @xmath10 are real  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath0 symmetry implies @xmath16 , and hence @xmath17 i.e. the pseudo - hermiticity of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we also require the matrix @xmath10 to be symmetric ( for the discussion of the relevance of this requirement see @xcite ) : @xmath18    the nonlinear operator @xmath19 is a @xmath8 matrix whose elements depend on the field @xmath20 .",
    "we focus on the case of the cubic nonlinearity when the entries @xmath21 of the matrix @xmath19 are given as @xmath22 i.e. @xmath23 are @xmath8 matrices with time - independent entries @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in other words , @xmath26 is a linear combination of pair - wise products of the elements of the vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( some of the coefficients @xmath29 can be equal to zero ) .    stationary nonlinear modes of system ( [ dyn_main ] ) correspond to solutions of the form @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a time - independent column vector solving the stationary nonlinear problem @xmath32 reality of @xmath33 is required for the existence of stationary nonlinear modes , and equality @xmath34 readily follows from eq .",

    "( [ stationary ] ) is reduced to a linear eigenvalue problem for the operator @xmath9 : @xmath36 ( hereafter tildes stand to indicate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues belonging to the linear spectrum ) .",
    "let us now recall some relevant properties of the linear problem  ( [ linear ] ) ( more details can be found e.g. in  @xcite ) .",
    "in a certain range of values of the parameter @xmath37 , a non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric operator @xmath38 may possess purely real spectrum .",
    "however , for a certain value ( or values ) of @xmath37 the system undergoes a spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking , corresponding to the transition from the real spectrum to complex one ( in the latter situation the system is said to be in the phase of broken @xmath0 symmetry ) .",
    "the transition to the broken @xmath0 symmetry phase can be described in terms of _ exceptional - point _",
    "spectral singularity  @xcite .",
    "if an eigenvalue @xmath39 of @xmath9 is real and possesses exactly one linearly independent eigenvector @xmath40 , then the latter can be chosen to be _ @xmath0-invariant _",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath41 independently on whether the @xmath0 symmetry of @xmath9 is unbroken or broken .",
    "notice that condition ( [ ptw ] ) fixes the phase of the vector @xmath40 , while the model ( [ dyn_main ] ) is phase invariant thanks to the choice of the cubic nonlinearity of the form ( [ eq : f ] ) . instead of vector @xmath40 fixed by ( [ ptw ] ) , one can consider any eigenvector of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is real .",

    ", one should distinguish between two different cases .",
    "in the first case , the multiple eigenvalue @xmath39 ( with algebraic multiplicity equal to @xmath51 ) possesses an invariant subspace spanned by @xmath51 linearly independent eigenvectors .",
    "in other words , the eigenvalue @xmath39 is _ semi - simple _ , and the hamiltonian @xmath9 is diagonalizable ( provided that all other eigenvalues are also simple or semi - simple ) .",
    "this situation arises , in particular , when two eigenvalues of a parameter - dependent hamiltonian @xmath9 coalesce at some value of the control parameter @xmath37 but the two corresponding eigenvalues remain linearly independent .",
    "physically such situation appears , in particular , when two ( or more ) identical systems are linearly coupled : the degeneracy occurs when the coupling becomes zero .",
    "the second case corresponds to the situation when collision of the eigenvalues is accompanied by collisions of eigenvectors .",
    "then the geometrical multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath39 if less than the algebraic multiplicity , i.e. the dimension of the invariant subspace of the multiple eigenvalue @xmath39 is less than @xmath51 .",
    "this corresponds to so - called _ exceptional _ points  @xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the relevance of such points is in particular related to the transition to the phase of broken @xmath0 symmetry ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we start by considering families of nonlinear modes bifurcating from a linear eigenstate of the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath39 be a simple real eigenvalue and @xmath40 is the corresponding eigenvector solving linear problem ( [ linear ] ) . according to the discussion in sec .",
