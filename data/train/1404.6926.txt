    "galaxies with masses similar to that of the milky way ( mw ) are thought to have been most efficient of all galaxies in turning available baryons into stars @xcite . at @xmath0 , a majority of them",
    "are dominated by discs @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a key question in astrophysics to understand the formation histories of mw - like disc galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite ( d13 hereafter ) and @xcite ( p13 hereafter ) presented observational data on the growth and structural evolution of such galaxies from @xmath6 to @xmath0 . to achieve this , d13 selected samples of galaxies in six disjoint redshift intervals at the same cumulative co - moving number density , assuming that this would reproduce the typical formation history of a @xmath0 galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath7 .",
    "p13 selected samples of galaxies at six redshifts from @xmath8 to @xmath0 according to their star formation rates ( sfrs ) and masses under the assumption that a typical selected galaxy stays on the evolving main sequence of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) and has a @xmath0 mass of @xmath9 .",
    "+      both papers concluded that the galaxy populations under consideration grew only mildly in effective radius over the studied time .",
    "stellar mass growth in the centre occurs at all times with outer growth being only mildly more efficient at late times .",
    "this behaviour differs strongly from the stellar mass growth as observed in massive elliptical galaxies , some of which apparently formed dense cores at high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) , and which as a population grew strongly in outer mass and effective radius at later times @xcite . this evolutionary path has been explained as a result of the continuous accretion of stars in dry major and minor mergers @xcite .",
    "major mergers destroy thin galactic discs @xcite , so disc dominated galaxies are thought to form in haloes with quiescent merger histories from the cooling of gas from increasingly large radii .",
    "this leads to an inside - out formation process ( e.g. @xcite ) , for which observational evidence in the form of radial stellar age gradients has been presented ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "results from abundance matching support the idea that most stars in disc galaxies formed in - situ @xcite .",
    "additionally , it has been suggested that for @xmath2cdm haloes , feedback processes that preferentially remove low - angular momentum gas are needed to explain the observed structure of galactic discs @xcite .",
    "several processes that modify the simple inside - out formation picture for disc galaxies are , however , known and can lead to substantial star formation ( sf ) in the central galactic regions . these include clump migration in violently unstable discs @xcite , bar - induced gas inflows @xcite , gas - rich minor mergers @xcite , angular momentum loss due to the reorientation of the disc rotation axis @xcite and the infall of gas with misaligned angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of local disc galaxies show small bulge fractions or even no evidence for a classical bulge at all ( e.g. @xcite ) has , on the one hand , been identified as a possible challenge to hierarchical galaxy formation in a @xmath2cdm universe ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it has also been shown that discs can ( re)form after gas - rich mergers @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for this process has been presented in the form of peculiar morphologies , anomalous kinematics and episodic star formation histories ( sfhs ) of spiral galaxies at @xmath11 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , @xcite have shown that a semi - empirical model for the bulge growth through mergers in a @xmath2cdm universe can correctly reproduce the observed @xmath0 distribution of galactic bulge fractions .",
    "they have , however , ignored other channels of bulge growth .",
    "in this work we use recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite to better understand the observed structural evolution of disc galaxies .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the sample of simulated galaxies . in section 3",
    "we illustrate the diverse formation histories of the models . in section 4",
    "we discuss the influence of mergers and misaligned infall . in section 5",
    "we compare to recent observations .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 6 .",
    "for our analysis of simulated disc galaxies , we rely on the models recently presented in @xcite ( a13 hereafter ) .",
    "these re - simulations follow the formation of galaxies in a @xmath2cdm universe , including dark matter and baryonic physics .",
    "the simulations were run with the tree - smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-3 , last described in @xcite .",
    "models for baryonic physics were presented in @xcite and a13 .",
    "they include a schmidt - type sf law above a threshold density of @xmath12 .",
    "the comoving gravitational softening lengths for baryonic and dark matter particles are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the particle masses for baryons and dark matter are in the ranges @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the effects of the sub - grid physics implementation and the choices of parameters are in detail discussed in a13 . at the given resolution of the models , lower values for the sf threshold density @xmath17 lead to less efficient feedback and less prominent galactic discs , whereas higher values lead to spurious effects due to a lack of resolution .",
    "the coarse resolution also prevents the formation of sufficiently cold , thin gas discs , as gas velocity dispersions are limited to values above @xmath18 ( see also @xcite )",
    ".    simulations also include models for metal production by supernovae ( sne ) of types ii and ia and by asymptotic giant branch stars , and metal - line cooling based on individual element abundances @xcite .",
    "metals can also mix by a scheme modelling their turbulent diffusion .",
    "feedback energy ejected from sne into the ism is split into a kinetic and a thermal part and , additionally , a model for feedback from radiation pressure of massive young stars on the surrounding ism is included .",
    "the application of an explicit multiphase scheme for gas particles allows the coexistence of and the exchange of material between a cold , dense phase , from which stars can form , and a diffuse , hot phase .",
    "our sample includes 19 @xmath0 galaxies , 18 of which were already discussed in a13 and one additional galaxy ( aqe ) , which in all studied properties behaves very similarly to the other studied galaxies .",
    "the initial conditions include five aquarius haloes @xcite , which were specifically selected to be prime candidates for hosting disc dominated galaxies at @xmath0 and consequently have rather quiescent merger histories .",
    "the remaining initial conditions originate from the sample presented by @xcite and have diverse assembly histories .",
    "specifically , 15 of the 19 galaxies undergo merger events at @xmath19 , which have a destructive effect on the stellar disc ( cf .",
    "figure 13 in a13 ) . at @xmath0 , 15 of the 19 galaxies can be regarded as central galaxies , whereas two haloes each host two galaxies of similar mass , which are about to merge in the near future .",
    "the halo mass range of the model galaxies is @xmath20 and the model galaxies at @xmath0 have stellar masses of @xmath21 .",
    "a13 showed that the sfhs and the @xmath0 stellar masses of the model galaxies are in good agreement with recent results from abundance matching by @xcite .",
    "as was shown in a13 , all but one of the model galaxies show significant disc components and are actively star - forming at @xmath0 .",
    "they show realistic morphologies in gas and stars , realistic surface brightness profiles and flat circular velocity curves .",
    "the evolution of gas fractions , stellar and gas phase metallicities is also in good agreement with observational constraints .",
    "the model galaxies thus present an interesting sample to be compared to recent observations of structural evolution of disc galaxies .",
    "we begin our analysis of simulated disc galaxies by creating mock three - colour images of galaxies at various redshifts .",
    "we therefore rotate each galaxy at each considered redshift to face - on orientation and create square pixels with side lengths of @xmath22 pc . using the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite for a @xcite initial mass function , we determine @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 band luminosities for all pixels taking into account masses , metallicities and ages of star particles .",
    "we also take into account obscuration effects by calculating gas - phase metal mass distributions along the line - of - sight for each pixel from the masses , sph smoothing lengths and metallicities of gas particles with @xmath26 .",
    "we use these as a proxy for the dust mass distributions . for each star particle , we thus obtain a dust surface density according to its position along the line - of - sight , which we convert into an extinction factor following the relations presented in @xcite .",
    "we assume that their results for the milky way correspond to solar metallicity gas and replace hi mass , as used in their relation , by cold gas mass .",
    "the extinction corrected @xmath27 luminosities are then mapped to blue / green / red colours to create three - colour images .",
    "this procedure was motivated by the images presented by @xcite .",
    "similar image series without extinction corrections were recently also presented by @xcite for their cosmological simulations of disc galaxies .    .",

    "images with sizes of 40 x 40 kpc for ten galaxies at redshifts @xmath31 2.5 , 2.0 , 1.5 , 1.1 , 0.85 , 0.37 and 0.0 are presented in fig .",
    "[ evolution1 ] .",
    "we can compare these images to the observed images presented in fig . 2 of d13 taking into account that the observed galaxies show various orientations and are presented in two - colour @xmath32 band images .",
    "as in the observed galaxy sample , the model galaxies change significantly during their evolution and become redder at redshifts @xmath19 as the specific sfrs decrease with time .",
    "the total sizes of galaxies grow significantly .",
    "the galaxies also undergo morphological changes with spiral structures being common at low @xmath33 , but less prominent at high @xmath33 .",
    "spiral structure is typically flocculent and there are very few indications of bars . for several galaxies , the fading of spiral structure due to a decrease in sfr is visible at z=0 .",
    "the importance of mergers is indicated by pairs , tidal structures and other irregular morphologies displayed by several galaxies , preferentially at higher redshifts .        at low @xmath33 ,",
    "there are several galaxies having red central regions deficient in sf , and bluer outskirts with higher sfrs , but also a few galaxies with blue , actively star forming centres .",
    "some model galaxies display phases of disc growth around a redder centre after a phase of central sf , but typically discs do not assemble around ` naked ' bulges .",
    "phases of replenished central sf can also follow after inside - out growth phases . moreover , there are galaxies which do not show a strong colour gradient between inner and outer parts .",
    "we conclude , that there is considerable diversity in behaviour and good qualitative agreement between observed and mock images .",
    "one generic problem in comparing structural properties of galaxies in observations and simulations are conversions from observed surface brightness to stellar mass and from simulated stellar mass to surface brightness .",
    "moreover , d13 and p13 use different bands for their analysis of structural evolution , bands close to rest - frame @xmath24 band ( d13 ) and bands close to rest frame @xmath28 band ( p13 ) respectively .",
    "orientations of galaxies also complicate the picture , as profiles from edge - on and face - on galaxies give different results .",
    "we attempt to address these complications in fig . [ radial - light ] .    we create mock images in @xmath34 band , as detailed above .",
    "this gives us qualitative insight into the effects involved , but is less sophisticated than fully self - consistent radiative transfer post - processing @xcite , which would , however , also result in significant parameter uncertainties and large computational costs .",

    "[ radial - light ] compares face - on radial profiles of model 1192 at @xmath0 for mass ( black ) and for @xmath34 band light ( blue / green / red ) normalized to their values at @xmath35 .",
    "we note that in all bands , the outer disc of the galaxy appears more prominent compared to the central regions than in the mass profile .",
    "the effective scale - length is highest in @xmath36 band , decreases with increasing wavelength and is smallest for the mass profile .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with observations that find longer disc scale - lengths at shorter wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) and of half - mass radii that are smaller than optical half - light radii ( e.g. @xcite ) . the @xmath23 band , which is a good tracer for young stars , is also significantly less smooth than the mass profile due to the clumpy nature of sf .",
    "the spikes produced by sf regions are less pronounced at longer wavelengths .",
    "the asterisks in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ radial - light ] give the face - on extinction factors predicted by our procedure .",
    "these are typically below 2 , only for some sf regions , there are higher values in the @xmath23 band .",
    "the discrepancies between light and mass profile in 1192 are a bit stronger than average for galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "we find the strongest discrepancies for galaxies with old , red centres surrounded by blue star - forming ` rings ' .",
    "hardly any discrepancies are found for the spheroidal model 6782 , which has stopped sf after a merger at @xmath37 . at high @xmath33 , discrepancies are typically less distinct , as radial stellar population gradients are smaller .",
    "extinction effects are stronger at high @xmath33 due to higher gas fractions .",
    "a full discussion of discrepancies between light and mass profiles is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "if we redo the exercise for edge - on views and create profiles for a slit of 1 kpc width , the results are markedly different .",
    "the mass profile shows an almost identical exponential decline outside @xmath38 as in the face - on profile , but the central excess is weakened due to projection effects .",
    "however , the extinction caused by the significantly larger dust column densities severely affects the light profiles , which in all bands are shallower than the mass profile .",
    "the different bands differ primarily in variability for the reasons discussed above .",
    "the extinction factors , as shown by the diamonds in the lower panel of fig . [ radial - light ] , are typically of the order of 3 - 10 but can be as high as 50 in the @xmath23 band .    we conclude that both the selection of the colour band and the orientation can have a significant effect on the determination of structural properties for disc galaxies . we have shown that both @xmath24 and @xmath28 band profiles do not accurately trace mass profiles , with discrepancies being smaller in @xmath28 band . in our work ,",
    "we now restrict ourselves to face - on profiles and caution that the above findings should be kept in mind .    in fig .",
    "[ radial - g ] we depict the structural evolution of two galaxies with very different formation histories .",
    "we show profiles in mass , raw @xmath24 band and obscured @xmath24 band from @xmath6 to @xmath0 . for the light profiles",
    ", we normalize each profile to the same total ` mass ' as the corresponding mass profile .        the model galaxy 1192 ( seventh row in fig .",
    "[ evolution1 ] ) experiences its last significant merger at @xmath11 and develops a central bar afterwards .",
    "its stellar mass increases continuously at all radii , it does not experience classical inside - out growth .",
    "when analyzing raw and obscured @xmath24 band light profiles , we notice that these are more extended ( see discussion above ) and less smooth , but the continuous growth at all radii remains clearly visible .",
    "model galaxy aqc ( ninth row in fig .",
    "[ evolution1 ] ) evolves very differently .",
    "its central mass density only increases at early times and later decreases due to stellar mass loss .",
    "after @xmath39 , there is little change in surface density at @xmath40 .",
    "gas infall then happens predominantly in the outer regions , which leads to the formation of a star - forming ring of varying extent around the dead central region .",
    "the galaxy thus displays inside - out formation . in raw @xmath24-band light",
    ", the evolution looks significantly different ( see e.g. also the models of @xcite ) .",
    "the central surface brightness decreases continuously as no new stars form and bright stars die early . taking obscuration into account ,",
    "this behaviour is still visible , but it is weaker , as galaxies are richer in gas and dust relative to stars at earlier times . as it is the site of sf , and thus of bright young stars , the ring is significantly more distinct in surface brightness than in mass surface density , constituting a local maximum in surface brightness both in the raw and in the obscured light profiles .",
    "if such effects are not accounted for , the inferred structural history would differ significantly depending on whether mass or @xmath24-band light were used .",
    "having studied the differences between light and mass profiles , we use fig .",
    "[ radial - all ] to give an overview of the structural evolution of all 19 model galaxies , restricting ourselves to face - on surface mass density profiles . as was discussed in a13 ,",
    "the sfrs at redshifts @xmath41 of the model galaxies with the lowest and highest masses deviate from observations .",
    "the lower mass models tend to underproduce stars at these times , whereas the four highest mass galaxies overproduce stars at low redshifts ( the models are sorted by mass in fig .",
    "[ radial - all ] ) . for the high mass models , this overproduction is visible as the strong mass growth between @xmath42 and @xmath0 , which happens predominantly in central regions .",
    "this central growth disagrees also with recent observations by @xcite who find that galaxies with the highest central mass surface densities usually show low @xmath0 sfrs .",
    "one possible solution for this problem could be the inclusion of a model for agn feedback to stop the cooling of hot gas onto the galaxies at low @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see that all of the higher and lower mass models are more similar in evolution to 1192 than to aqc , as they show continuous mass growth at all radii .",
    "the detailed extent and distribution of mass growth varies significantly , but the majority of these galaxies show more complex evolution than simple inside - out growth .",
    "all the lower and higher mass galaxies are part of the halo sample first studied by @xcite .",
    "the remaining ten haloes are in equal parts made up of haloes from @xcite and of aquarius haloes @xcite .",
    "for these ten haloes a13 found sfhs in good agreement with abundance matching predictions by @xcite , as well as @xmath0 masses which are similar to the ones of the galaxies studied by d13 and p13 .",
    "the aquarius haloes were selected to be prime candidates for hosting disc galaxies and have rather quiescent merger histories .",
    "four out of five of these ( aqb is the exception ) host galaxies with kinematic disc fractions above @xmath43 , higher than any of the disc fractions found in non - aquarius haloes .",
    "the structural evolution of all aquarius haloes shows an inside - out behaviour with varying details .",
    "interestingly , the haloes from @xcite that are closest to simple inside - out formation are also in this mass range ( the two galaxies in halo 0977 , which are however about to merge after @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite recently presented an archaeological study of the growth of observed galaxies as a function of time and radius .",
    "they found that the inferred relative stellar mass growth histories for their lowest mass galaxies are similar at all radii with centres being tendentiously younger than outskirts , whereas in the most massive galaxies the centres have grown significantly earlier than the outskirts .",
    "if we exclude our most massive galaxies , which overproduce stars at late times , the remaining models cover a similar range in stellar mass as the observational sample .",
    "the corresponding panels in fig .",
    "[ radial - all ] indicate similar trends as in observations . splitting these model galaxies into three mass bins",
    ", we also find that the lowest mass galaxies show very similar growth rates for inner and outer regions . with increasing mass the difference between outer and inner growth rates increases with inner parts being significantly older .",
    "we do , however , not recover the trend of low mass galaxies having younger inner than outer regions .    in each panel of fig .",
    "[ radial - all ] , we give the sersic index @xmath44 we find when fitting one - component sersic profiles to the @xmath0 surface mass density profiles . in a13 , we have shown that most profiles show a down - bending break at outer radii .",
    "we attempted to fit the profiles out to the break radii .",
    "not all profiles are well fit by one - component profiles .",
    "the resulting indices @xmath44 scatter between 1 and 4 .",
    "interestingly , we find no correlation between @xmath44 and the kinetic disc fraction as determined in a13 .",
    "the four galaxies with highest kinematic disc fractions have @xmath44 values between 1.5 and 4 . in aqc ( @xmath45 ) , the high value results from the ring - like stellar disc structure around the central dispersion - dominated regions .",
    "there is a trend of increasing sersic index with galaxy mass , but not as clear as in real galaxies @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that simulated disc galaxies exhibit a variety in morphologies and formation histories when analyzed with mock three - colour images , or through the evolution of surface brightness / density profiles .",
    "for the latter , we find evolution ranging from inside - out growth of a disc around a central stellar population which hardly evolves after @xmath39 to continuous mass growth at all radii at all times .",
    "we find more extended discs in optical light than in mass , as in observations , and we identify complications in the interpretation of mass evolution from light profiles especially for edge - on galaxies and for galaxies that grow mainly inside - out .",
    "in our introduction we listed several mechanisms that lead to central mass growth in disc galaxies . in a13",
    "we already noted that our models contain only a small number of bars .",
    "[ evolution1 ] confirmed this and also showed no examples of unstable , clumpy discs .",
    "this leaves mergers and accretion of gas with misaligned angular momentum as possible mechanisms .",
    "we have shown that haloes selected to have more quiescent merger histories show less central mass growth . in a13",
    ", we already showed that misaligned infall of gas can lead to the formation of a counter - rotating disc on top of an existing disc . in this section",
    "we study in more detail , how mergers and misaligned infall influence the structural history of our model disc galaxies .",
    "reorientation of disc galaxies by large angles in these simulations is always connected to misaligned infall , which is why we do not analyze it separately here .    motivated by @xcite , we plot in fig .",

    "the model galaxies show a variety of structural evolution histories , ranging from inside - out growing discs around older , more centrally concentrated stellar populations to continuous sf at all radii .",
    "our models show only a small number of bars and no unstable , clumpy discs , so that not all known mechanisms for central mass growth in disc galaxies are well represented .",

    "we have shown that mergers or misaligned infall leave distinct features in the distributions of present - day radii , circularities and metallicities as functions of stellar age .",
    "observational detection of such features is complicated by the fact that the timescales of these events are smaller than the typical errors in age determinations of stars .    in our simulations , metallicities effectively increase during events that drive central sf , as these events enrich the ism . the evolution of metallicities in discs due to interactions has been studied in detail by several groups @xcite .",
    "all these papers discuss non - cosmological simulations of mergers of pairs of disc galaxies .",
    "they all apply sph codes without a prescription for the turbulent diffusion of metals , which is included in our fully cosmological models and has been shown to significantly change the metallicity distributions in discs @xcite and the circumgalactic medium @xcite .",
    "all these models find a strong initial dilution of central metallicities caused by the inflow of gas originating from the outer disc which , due to the metallicity gradients assumed in the set - up , is metal poor . in a13",
    "we showed that the discs in our simulations have gradients that are shallower than observed and @xcite recently showed that the details of feedback models significantly influence gradients . because of",
    "the shallow gradients , only very weak metallicity dilution features in the form of slightly lowered metallicities at the beginning of the events can be found in fig .",
    "[ archae ] . for the idealized simulations ,",
    "it has , however , also been shown that enrichment due to sf in gas - rich mergers leads to an effective increase of metallicities at the end of the merger , in agreement with our findings .",
    "we conclude that events which trigger central sf are likely to leave an imprint on the age - metallicity relation of stars in that region and possibly also throughout the whole disc , but the shape of this feature is uncertain on account of modelling uncertainties .",
    "when we compare our sample of simulated galaxies directly to observed samples , we have to take into account that the allowed scatter in the observers selection criteria on evolution histories is much narrower than the scatter of the evolution histories displayed by our simulated galaxies .",

    "agreement with the assumptions of p13 in terms of sfh at slightly lower galaxy masses is better .    nevertheless , independent of sample selection , the mean profiles of the simulated galaxies agree with observations at @xmath110 . at later times , galaxies show too little central mass growth and effective radii that increase too rapidly . at @xmath0 galaxies",

    "size growth is strongest for galaxies with masses similar to that of the mw and several of those models show strong inside - out growth . although our full sample of galaxies shows better agreement with observations , we caution that this behaviour is driven by the high central sfrs and high central stellar mass densities at @xmath0 of the most massive galaxies , which are likely unrealistic .",
    "@xcite recently showed that low - redshift galaxies with high central mass densities are preferentially quenched .",
    "the lack of a model of agn feedback in our simulations is a possible cause for this .",
    "it is interesting to note that our models agree best with observations at high @xmath33 , as , until recently , simulations matched observational data particularly poorly at early formation stages ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as already discussed in a13 , our new simulations show better agreement with a variety of observations at @xmath155 than at @xmath0 .",
    "one clearly identified problem is the lack of bars , which predominantly form at low @xmath33 and can lead to inflow of gas to the centres of discs .",
    "one reason for this are overly high velocity dispersions in our model discs ( see a13 ) , which can prevent the formation of dynamically cold structures .",
    "coarse resolution prevents low velocity dispersions ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but other simulations at the same resolution have produced many barred systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our models differ from these as they have lower surface densities and lower baryon conversion efficiencies .",
    "the main reason for the differences is the strong stellar feedback applied in our models .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , our feedback implementation is very efficient at removing low angular momentum material .",
    "in general , the angular momentum of accreted gas in our models also increases with time .",
    "moreover , low angular momentum gas that is blown out in early formation stages can re - accrete after several gyr , but then has on average gained angular momentum .",
    "all these points combine to keep central baryonic surface densities low and to reduce bulge fractions .",
    "they thus also help in preventing disc instabilities , which could lead to bar formation and thus enhance central surface densities , which in turn would make the discs more unstable due to the increase in surface gravity .",
    "@xcite recently simulated five of our haloes with a different galaxy formation code .",
    "interestingly , in these haloes , they found more massive and less extended galaxies compared to our models . on average ,",
    "their sizes lie mildly above the observed mass - size relation of @xcite .",
    "they used a very different prescription for stellar feedback and also find a higher fraction of bars .",
    "these arguments seem to suggest that the effects of the stellar feedback models applied in our simulations are too strong at low redshifts , as was also indicated by the underproduction of stars at low @xmath33 in lower mass galaxies , as discussed in a13 .",
    "it is interesting that the model for feedback from radiation pressure from young massive stars already invokes a significantly stronger feedback for high @xmath33 gas - rich , turbulent galaxies than for quiescently star - forming discs at low @xmath33 .",
    "it is possible that the calibration on galaxies similar in mass to the mw is problematic . at this halo mass",
    "the quenching mechanism needed for high mass galaxies , be it agn or something else , but not implemented here , probably already plays a role .",
    "moreover , in our simulations , feedback is particularly efficient in removing material during mergers @xcite , so that central mass growth during these events might actually be underestimated in our models .",
    "simulations of disc galaxy formation have long been struggling with removing sufficient amounts of low angular momentum material from the inner regions and avoiding the formation of overly compact galaxies .",
    "apparently our efforts in a13 to overcome this have led to the opposite problem .",
    "weakening feedback seems an obvious solution , but the success of the model at high redshifts suggests that this should only be effective at late times .",
    "evidently , our models are still far from capturing all relevant astrophysical processes accurately .",
