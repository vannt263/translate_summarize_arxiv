    "the concept of position - dependent mass comes from effective - mass approximation of many - body problem in condensed matter physics @xcite . in recent times a good number of articles have been published @xcite in this field .",
    "the schrdinger equation with position - dependent mass has been studied in the contexts of supersymmetry , shape - invariance , lie algebra , point - canonical transformation , etc .",
    "it is well known that the kinetic energy operator in this case belongs to the two - parameter family @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with the constraint @xmath3 however , the correct values of the parameters @xmath4 for a specific model is a long - standing debate @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of a potential step and barrier @xcite , and in some one - dimensional potential wells @xcite with varying mass , the following kinetic energy operator was chosen @xmath5 which corresponds to @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "then , it was shown that the reflection and transmission coefficients @xcite , as well as the discrete spectrum @xcite , are different compared to the constant - mass problem .    in this article",
    "we are going to study the following physical problem : the potential energy has the form of a well , both in symmetric as well as asymmetric form , and the kinetic energy is given by ( [ t ] ) with a mass function @xmath8 which has different constant values inside and outside the well .",
    "this problem has also interest from the point of view of applications in carbon nanotubes and quantum dots , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "our purpose is first to find an ordering of the kinetic energy term appropriate to this problem , and then , to study in full detail the bound states of this model and to compare the results with the conventional constant - mass case .",
    "several problems which resemble our model have been considered previously in the literature .",
    "for example , the scattering states of a potential step or barrier were studied in @xcite .",
    "other special square well potentials were analysed in @xcite , and the bound states for some finite and infinite wells were studied using other kinetic energy operator and matching conditions in @xcite .",
    "however , our approach is different from the very beginning because we propose an ordering for kinetic term based on a specific argument for the matching conditions .",
    "this ordering is also used in @xcite for studying connection rules for effective - mass wave functions across an abrupt heterojunction .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows .",
    "[ matching ] is devoted to fix the ordering in the kinetic term . in sec .",

    "now , let us assume that the mass @xmath8 has a finite discontinuity at @xmath22 of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are smooth functions and the unit step function @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 0,\\ & x<0 .",

    "( [ s2 ] ) , we see that it leads to strong discontinuities at @xmath22 as well as some terms that require a careful interpretation . for instance",
    ", we should take into account that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the dirac delta distribution . in order to eliminate these problems in eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) , we can choose @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 were given in ( [ en ] ) .",
    "from these conditions , we obtain the values of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 . with such values ,",
    "the kinetic energy operator ( [ t ] ) becomes @xmath35 and eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) takes the following simple form @xmath36 now , it is easy to get the matching conditions for @xmath18 at @xmath22 . to do this ,",
    "first we integrate eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) around the discontinuity point @xmath22 @xmath37 in the interval @xmath38 , the functions @xmath8 and @xmath11 have finite discontinuities at @xmath22 and @xmath39 is bounded .",
    "therefore , when @xmath40 goes to zero , the integral at the r.h.s . of ( [ cont1 ] ) tends to zero .",
    "this means that @xmath41 ( and also @xmath39 ) will be continuous at @xmath22 . in conclusion , using the transformation ( [ fi ] ) we have arrived at the following matching conditions : the wave function @xmath21 is such that the two functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 are continuous at @xmath22 .",
    "mathematically it may be expressed as @xmath44    @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an interior point in the domain of the problem .",

    "since @xmath73 , the roots of this equation also give the energy values of the bound states .    as the maximum value that @xmath69 could take is @xmath74 , from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , we get an inequality for the number of bound states @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",

    "when we consider ( [ nb ] ) as an equation for @xmath79 , @xmath80 we say that the parameters of the well arecritical \" , in the sense that by modifying slightly their values we will have one bound state less or one bound state more .    from ( [ nb ] ) , for @xmath81 we see that the first bound state of the asymmetric square well will appear when the following condition is satisfied : @xmath82 therefore , we can say that for @xmath83 , there are always some values of the parameters of the well that do not allow for bound states , as it is also the case for the conventional constant - mass problem .",
    "the influence of @xmath51 ( the mass outside the well ) on the number of bound states is not so important .",
    "let us call @xmath84 the function on the l.h.s . of ( [ nbb ] )",
    ", then @xmath85 this means that as we increase @xmath51 the spectrum of bound states either will remain the same or will have one value less .",
    "this is in sharp contradistinction to the influence of @xmath52 , that can change any number of levels in the discrete spectrum .",
    "the conventional constant - mass case is obtained by taking @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) to get the well known formula @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath70 the inequality for the number of bound states is obtained now from ( [ nb ] ) if we put @xmath86 : @xmath88 however , we must stress that in the position - dependent mass case the critical values given by formula ( [ nb ] ) for the number of bound states depend on both @xmath51 and @xmath52 , in particular , as @xmath89 , we see from ( [ nbb ] ) that no bound states will remain in the well .",
    "if @xmath90 , from ( [ k12 ] ) , we get the energy equations corresponding to even and odd eigenfunctions by replacing @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively @xmath93 in this case , we can also write for both even and odd solutions the transcendental eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , using @xmath94 , in the following way @xmath95 where @xmath70 here , the argument of the inverse sine is always less than @xmath96 for @xmath97 , and therefore the formula is well defined .",
    "if we make @xmath98 in ( [ e4 ] ) the number of bound states @xmath77 is given by the highest @xmath78 satisfying the inequality @xmath99 this means that there are always bound states for the symmetric well . even more , once the depth @xmath100 and the width @xmath101 of the well are fixed , the number of bound states does not depend on @xmath51 , it depends only on the mass inside of the well ( @xmath52 ) . the relation ( [ nbm1 ] ) for the number of bound states coincides with that obtained also by plastino _",
    "et al _ using different matching conditions . however , the energy equations ( [ ke])([e4 ] ) are different from @xcite .",
    "in fact , when the inside mass is bigger ( smaller ) than the outside mass , then our energy spectrum is lower ( upper ) than the spectrum given in @xcite",
    ".    the critical values of the well ( which determine when we have one bound state more ) are obtained from @xmath102 thus the critical values of @xmath46 are linear in the number @xmath103 of bound states , while the critical values @xmath52 grow as the square of @xmath104 . in conclusion ,",
    "the important parameter here is the mass @xmath52 inside the well , while the mass outside ( @xmath51 ) plays a secondary role .",
    "the number of bound states for the conventional constant - mass symmetric well are given also by ( [ nbm1 ] ) replacing @xmath105 .",
    "however , the energy of these bound states is defined through ( [ e4 ] ) by choosing @xmath86 @xmath106 hence the values of the energies will be different from the position - dependent mass .",
    "in this section we will discuss some numerical results and graphics obtained from the formulas of the previous sections , paying attention to the consequences of mass variation .",
    "consider the situation of a particle of mass @xmath51 in a square well potential , where we have altered the conditions inside the well to produce a different effective mass @xmath52 .",
    "we want to study the effects that this change of mass will produce on the bound states .",
    "the main characteristics of the asymmetric well may be summarized as follows :    1 .",

    "in this article we have studied a potential well both in symmetric and asymmetric form , with different constant mass inside and outside the well .",
    "we have proposed specific values for the ordering parameters in the kinetic term based on the simple argument that strong singularities in the effective - mass schrdinger equation should be avoided . however ,",

    "similar to the conventional constant - mass case we have obtained a transcendental equation for bound state energies .",
    "we have shown our numerical results for different values of the parameters .",
    "many interesting differences from conventional constant - mass situation have been pointed out . in particular , the bound states are controlled mainly by the mass inside the well , while the mass outside , in general acts simply as a tuning of the specific values of the energies in the spectrum .",
    "the experiments have also shown that the energy level spacing is very sensitive to the effective mass inside the well , while the effects of the other parameters are not so important @xcite . finally , we have remarked the influence of the matching conditions , related to the kinetic term , on the discrete spectrum by comparing our results with those of @xcite .",
    "we have also determined some critical values of the well , that is the values of the potential and mass functions giving rise to the new bound states in the well .",
