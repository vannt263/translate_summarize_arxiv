    "zwicky  3146 ( z3146 ) is an x - ray - luminous cluster of galaxies at a redshift of 0.29 .",
    "its soft ( 0.12.4 kev ) x - ray luminosity , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 km s@xmath8 . ] of @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 @xcite is one of the largest known , and based on the _ rosat _ data , z3146 was thought to exhibit one of the most massive cluster cooling flows @xcite . our analysis of _ chandra _ data confirms that the gas cooling rate is indeed large with an estimated mass deposition rate of @xmath10 @xmath11 yr@xmath8 within a 50 kpc radius from the cluster center @xcite .",
    "the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) is exceptionally active , showing a blue continuum and luminous nebular emission lines @xcite and an infrared luminosity of @xmath12 l@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the mid - infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) suggests that the source of the large infrared luminosity is star formation at a rate of @xmath1470 @xmath11 yr@xmath8 , broadly consistent with the mass deposition rate mentioned above .",
    "this may indicate that the active star formation is caused by cooling cluster gas accreting onto the bcg , i.e. , the cooling flow @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the bcg seems to contain a radio agn that may contribute to its luminosity @xcite .    to investigate the mid - infrared spectral properties in detail ,",
    "we have observed the bcg in z3146 using the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) on board the _ spitzer _ space telescope @xcite .",
    "the irs spectra of the bcg in z3146 covering 538 @xmath15 m were taken in the staring mode with the two low - resolution modules , short - low ( sl ; @xmath16 m ) and long - low ( ll ; @xmath17 m ) , with a resolving power of @xmath18 .",
    "the sl spectra were taken for 8 cycles of 60 s ramp durations for both the 2nd ( sl2 : 5.28.7 @xmath15 m ) and 1st ( sl1 : 7.414.5 @xmath15 m ) orders while the ll spectra were taken for 8 cycles of 120 s ramp durations for the 2nd order ( ll2 : 14.021.3@xmath15 m ) and 6 cycles for the 1st order ( ll1 : 19.5 38.0 @xmath15 m ) .",
    "the resultant integration times are 960 s ( sl1 and sl2 ) , 1920 s ( ll2 ) , and 1440 s ( ll1 ) , respectively , after coadding the spectra taken at the two nod positions .",
    "the slit width is 37 for the sl and 107 for the ll module .    starting with the reduced and coadded two dimensional spectral image at each nod position",
    ", we performed sky subtraction in two passes , first by taking the difference between the two nod positions ( spectral images targetting different orders were paired to avoid both the positive and negative spectra falling in the same order ) and second by fitting and subtracting a linear fit to the background along each row in the cross - dispersed direction ( only fitting the pixels well away from the source spectrum ) .",
    "then , pixels with an abnormal signal near the source spectrum were manually masked out from the subsequent processing . from the background - subtracted and cleaned spectral images ,",
    "the source spectrum was extracted at each nod position using the program spice with extraction apertures reduced to 75% of the default widths .",
    "all the spectra were combined by resampling them with a uniform resolving power of 130 over the whole wavelength range .",
    "finally , the combined spectrum was multiplied by 1.4 to match the irac 8.0 @xmath15 m and mips 24 @xmath15 m photometry .",
    "the final combined irs spectrum of the bcg in z3146 is shown in figure  [ irs ] .",
    "the measured line fluxes and rest - frame equivalent widths are listed in table  [ flux ] . along the spatial direction ,",
    "the lines and continuum are unresolved ( fwhm@xmath142 pixels ) , which sets an upper limit of 36 in sl and 102 in ll , respectively , on the size of the mid - infrared emitting region .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the z3146 bcg is barely resolved at 8 @xmath15 m with a spatial resolution of 2  @xcite .",
    "strong aromatic ( `` pah '' ) emission features are detected at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.3 @xmath15 m .",
    "these features indicate that the mid - infrared ( and therefore presumably the far - infrared ) luminosity of this galaxy has a significant component of active star formation .",
    "the spectrum also shows exceptionally strong emission lines from molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath2 ) .",
    "we have securely detected the 00 s(1 ) , s(2 ) , s(3 ) , s(4 ) , and s(5 ) pure rotational lines .",
    "although the 00 s(0 ) line is within the observed wavelength range ( @xmath19 m ) , the noise in the ll1 band increases dramatically beyond 35 @xmath15 m , preventing us from setting a meaningful upper limit on the line flux .",
    "the 00 s(6 ) line is blended with the bright 6.2 @xmath15 m pah feature nearby .",
    "a few atomic fine - structure emission lines are also detected in the spectrum such as [ ]  12.8 @xmath15 m and [ ]  15.5 @xmath15 m .",
    "the [ ]  18.7 @xmath15 m line is possibly detected as well , but because of the low signal - to - noise ratio , we treat it as a non - detection here . also , no high - ionization line ( e.g. , [ ]  15.6@xmath15 m ) is seen . the small [ ] / [ ]  line ratio of 0.2 is typical of a starburst galaxy @xcite although we can not rule out a significant contribution to these neon lines from a shock - excited gas as discussed below .",
    "there are possible detections of the [ ]  lines at 5.3 and 26.0 @xmath15 m .",
    "however , a longer integration time is needed to confirm the reality of these lines .",
    "in terms of the strength of the 6.2 @xmath15 m pah feature , the z3146 bcg appears to be a typical starburst - dominated infrared luminous galaxy .",
    "the rest - frame equivalent width of the feature ( 0.67 @xmath15 m ) as well as its luminosity ratio to the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath20 ) are both within the range found for starburst galaxies , @xmath21 @xmath15 m for the former @xcite and @xmath22 for the latter @xcite , respectively . given the absence of any agn - related features in the spectrum , the agn contribution to the infrared luminosity is likely to be small .",
    "the most striking feature of the spectrum is the exceptionally strong emission lines from molecular hydrogen .",
    "the luminosities of the pure rotational lines are on average 6.3 times larger than those of ngc  6240 , the most h@xmath2-luminous galaxy at @xmath4 .",
    "the h@xmath2  line strengths are even more remarkable when compared with the infrared luminosity of this bcg .",
    "figure  [ lum_ratio]a plots the line luminosity of the h@xmath2  00 s(1 ) emission line against the infrared luminosity of various galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath2  00 s(1)/infrared luminosity ratio of this bcg is extreme ( 0.25% ) , almost an order of magnitude larger than the ratio for ngc  6240 ( 0.03% ) , and a factor of 50 above the trend line for the other galaxies ( 0.005% ) .",
    "figure  [ h2 ] shows the h@xmath2  level population in the z3146 bcg . for comparison ,",
    "the level population in ngc  6240 is overplotted after being scaled by a factor of 6.3 .",
    "the level populations are quite similar in shape between the two galaxies in the lowest energy states ( @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ) .",
    "these lowest energy states are almost always thermalized ( i.e. , collisionally excited ) , and therefore the similarity suggests that although the total mass of warm h@xmath2  differs between the two galaxies , the fractional h@xmath2  mass distribution as a function of temperature is similar up to a gas temperature of @xmath14960 k ( i.e. , the h@xmath2  excitation temperature derived for the @xmath23 , @xmath25 and 7 states using the 00 s(4 ) and s(5 ) lines ) .",
    "assuming that this similarity of the level population extends down to the @xmath26 state , from which the 00 s(0 ) line originates , we estimate the total warm h@xmath2  mass in the z3146 bcg to be @xmath27 , i.e. , 6.3 times larger than that of ngc  6240 ( @xmath28 by @xcite ) .",
    "this mass is dominated by the @xmath14160 k component , a temperature derived from the 00 s(0)/00 s(1 ) line ratio measured for ngc  6240 .",
    "the cold h@xmath2  mass derived from the co observation is also large , @xmath5 @xcite , but the fraction of warm h@xmath2  mass is high , @xmath1410% , similar to the 15% fraction found in ngc  6240 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ h2 ] also shows that the h@xmath2  level population of the z3146 bcg in the @xmath29 vibrational state is highly suppressed ( by a factor of 30 ) with respect to that in the @xmath23 state when the ngc  6240 @xmath23 level population is used as a template .",
    "although part of this suppression is due to the slit loss with the near - infrared spectroscopy as well as internal dust extinction , these effects , even when combined , are unlikely to be sufficient .",
    "for example , the size of the mid - infrared emitting region is 2  at most as already mentioned , so the 15 slit used to measure the @xmath30 near - infrared h@xmath2  lines @xcite should capture most of the total line fluxes . also , in this bcg",
    ", the extinction derived from the balmer decrement is @xmath31 mag @xcite , and when corrected for this amount , the h@xmath32-derived star formation rate agrees well with the infrared - derived star formation rate @xcite , suggesting that the extinction can not be much larger .",
    "in fact , near-/mid - infrared h@xmath2  emission lines are known to show little extinction in infrared - luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suppression of the @xmath29 state suggests that the @xmath29 level population in the z3146 bcg is subthermal as is the case with ngc  6240 @xcite .",
    "although the cause of such a subthermal level population is not clear , one possibility is that the h@xmath2  molecules are excited by a continuous ( i.e. , c - type ) shock , which can produce subthermal level populations in the low vibrational states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that alternative excitation mechanisms such as a jump ( j - type ) shock or far - uv radiation would produce a @xmath29 level population at or above the thermal level with respect to the @xmath23 state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . figure  [ h2 ] shows that only a factor of @xmath147 scaling is required to bring up the @xmath29 level population in the z3146 bcg to that of ngc  6240 .",
    "this correction factor is much easier to account for than the factor of 30 mentioned above , which would be required if the @xmath29 state is thermalized .",
    "shock excitation is also consistent with the previous near - infrared spectroscopic studies of nearby cooling - flow cluster bcgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the [ ]  12.8 @xmath15 m line of this bcg is also strong .",
    "figure  [ lum_ratio]b plots the [ ]  12.8 @xmath15 m luminosity against the infrared luminosity for a sample of nearby infrared - bright galaxies . as shown by @xcite",
    ", there is a good correlation between the two luminosities among the starburst and seyfert galaxies , and the z3146 bcg again stands out by having an exceptionally strong [ ]  12.8 @xmath15 m line for its infrared luminosity ( 0.75% ) ,    this overluminous [ ]  emission line may also arise from a shock . however , the c - type shock invoked above to explain the h@xmath2  level population can not produce a substantial amount of the [ ]  line because the shocked gas in a c - type shock is largely neutral and molecular . to produce the [ ]  line , the shock must be a fast ( @xmath33 km s@xmath8 ) j - type shock , that can dissociate and ionize the shocked gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the z3146 bcg has an h@xmath32 velocity width of @xmath34 km s@xmath8 @xcite , so such a fast shock is plausible .",
    "this probably means that various types of shocks may coexist in the z3146 bcg .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached for ngc  6240 by @xcite to account for the strong [ ]  63 @xmath15 m line , which is also a sign of a j - type shock .",
    "indeed , such a coexistence of the c- and j - type shocks is also seen in some galactic outflow sources , in which both strong h@xmath2  and [ ]  lines are detected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "shock models can produce a wide range of [ ] / [ ]  line ratios depending on various shock conditions , and therefore it is possible to produce the starburst like [ ] /[]ratio with a strong shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "[ ]  lines may also be used to constrain the shock conditions if their strengths are measured accurately .    with respect to the [ ]  12.8 @xmath15 m line , the [ ]  18.7",
    "@xmath15 m line is abnormally weak ( [ ] / [ ]  @xmath350.05 ) . such a low [ ] / [ ]  ratio is often seen with ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , indicating that the gas phase abundance of sulfur is significantly below solar @xcite .",
    "starburst galaxies also show this sulphur `` deficiency '' although the [ ] / [ ]  ratios are less extreme , and this may suggest that the sulphur is depleted onto dust grains in high - metallicity star - forming systems @xcite .",
    "we present the _ spitzer_/irs mid - infrared spectrum of the infrared - luminous bcg in the x - ray luminous cluster z3146 .",
    "the strong aromatic features indicate that the dominant source of the infrared luminosity is star formation .",
    "the most striking feature of the spectrum , however , is the exceptionally strong h@xmath2  emission lines . to our knowledge",
    ", this bcg has the most luminous h@xmath2  pure - rotational emission lines and most massive warm h@xmath2  gas component ( @xmath27 ) known .",
    "together with the large amount of cold h@xmath2  detected previously ( @xmath5 ) , this indicates that the z3146 bcg contains disproportionately large amounts of both warm and cold h@xmath2  gas for its infrared luminosity .",
    "since the parent cluster z3146 has an exceptionally large gas cooling rate in the core , these massive warm and cold h@xmath2  components may be related to the intracluster gas cooling process .",
