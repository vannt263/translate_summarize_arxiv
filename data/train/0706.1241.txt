    "rim radii are too large to represent dust sublimation fronts , fueling speculation that inside the hole , either ( a ) grains have grown too large for the medium to remain optically thick , ( b ) planets have consumed or torqued away material , and/or ( c ) the inner disk has drained onto the central star by accretion .",

    "we propose that gas is leached from the inner disk rim by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) , a linear instability that amplifies magnetic fields in outwardly shearing disks and drives turbulence ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "x - rays emitted by the hyperactive corona of the central star irradiate and ionize the disk rim , activating the mri there .",
    "magnetically active gas diffuses inward from the rim to the star .",
    "the inner hole grows as the mri eats its way out .",
    "the accretion rate interior to the ever - expanding rim is steady ( constant with radius ) and entirely set by the accretion rate established at the rim .",
    "historically , whether the mri is relevant to t tauri disks has been a prospect fraught with doubt ( see , e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "2006 ) , as protoplanetary disk gas is typically too cold and/or too dusty to couple well to magnetic fields .",
    "the following two conditions must be met for the mri to be viable .",

    "transitional disks furnish an excellent first laboratory in which to investigate whether the mri plays a role , if any , in how t tauri disks accrete .",
    "transitional disk holes are less plagued by sub - micron - sized dust that threatens to scour the region of plasma .",
    "furthermore , the rim wall provides an especially simple geometry for analyzing how x - rays ionize disk material : if the wall is not severely shadowed from the star by material interior to the rim ( see  [ unresolved ] ) , one need only treat the 1-d radial transfer of radiation perpendicular to the rim wall .",
    "x - ray driven mri is not a new idea  it was originally introduced by glassgold , najita , & igea ( 1997 , hereafter gni97)but our study applies it for the first time to transitional disks and to identify the correct criterion for where the mri can operate under these conditions .",
    "we argue that the entire region interior to the rim , including the midplane , is mri - active .",
    "this contrasts with previous studies of x - ray driven ( gni97 ; igea & glassgold 1999 , hereafter ig99 ) or cosmic - ray driven ( gammie 1996 , hereafter g96 ; sano et al .",
    "2000 ) mri in which accretion is confined to the surface layers of a disk whose midplane properties can not be calculated from first principles .",
    "moreover , such surface accretion is unsteady ( g96 ) .",
    "the accretion rates that we derive here are steady and can be directly compared to observations . thus , transitional disks not only provide insight into the late stages of disk evolution , but also offer the first clean application of ideas  namely , mri triggered by non - thermal ionization processes ( g96 ; gni97)pioneered for more complex systems .    in  [ rim ] , we construct a simple model for the rate of mass flow from the x - ray illuminated rim . we solve the equations of ionization and energy balance to decide how much of the rim satisfies criteria ( [ re ] ) and ( [ am ] ) and accretes .",
    "in addition to accounting for the usual dissociative recombination of molecular ions with free electrons ( e.g. , gni97 ) , our treatment of ionization balance includes recombination onto dust grains ( umebayashi & nakano 1980 ) and charge transfer to free atomic metals ( oppenheimer & dalgarno 1974 , hereafter od74 ; fromang , terquem , & balbus  2002 ) .",
    "we show how criterion ( [ am ] ) , neglected in many studies of protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , g96 ; gni97 ; ig99 ; sano et al .",
    "2000 ; fromang et al .  2002 ; matsumura & pudritz 2003 ) , supersedes criterion ( [ re ] ) .",
    "we establish a relation between accretion rate @xmath29 and rim radius @xmath2 and compare to observations .    in  [ steady ] ,",
    "we demonstrate how the mri continues to transport gas inward at radii @xmath30 .",
    "though the midplane of the interior disk is optically thick to incident x - rays , compton scattering permits enough x - rays to reach the midplane ( ig99 ) that the mri operates there as well .",
    "accretion is therefore steady from the rim to the star .    in ",
    "[ rad ] , we study in a preliminary way how stellar radiation pressure blows dust grains out of accreting gas and can keep the disk inside the rim relatively transparent .",
    "we make a connection to the small but non - zero optical depth inferred for the inner disk from sed modelling ( c02 ; c05 ) to constrain the abundance of micron - sized grains in the rim .",

    "these ionization fractions correspond to @xmath167 at 1 au and @xmath168 at 0.1 au , values that satisfy criterion ( [ re ] ) , albeit marginally .",
    "finally , taking @xmath169 , we find that @xmath170 at 1 au and @xmath171 at 0.1 au .",
    "these values for @xmath134 , which marginally satisfy criterion ( [ am ] ) , are insensitive to variations in @xmath172 , which produce changes in @xmath24 that nearly cancel changes in @xmath71 . the margins of safety for @xmath155 and @xmath134 would increase by accounting for thermal ionization .",
    "we conclude that the mri plausibly operates everywhere interior to the rim , even at the disk midplane , carrying steadily inward all of the mass drawn from the rim .",
    "note how the mri - active vertical columns at 0.11 au , @xmath173 , are larger than the mri - active radial column at the rim , @xmath122 .",
    "this follows from criterion ( [ am ] ) , which assigns importance to the total density @xmath174 , not the fractional density @xmath71 .",
    "total densities increase dramatically from the rim to the star .",
    "gas drawn from the rim entrains dust grains . as the surface density of inspiralling gas increases towards the star , so , too , does the surface density of grains .",
    "left unchecked , the increasing concentration of grains would render the inner disk optically thick at infrared wavelengths , violating observations . here",
    "we explore how stellar radiation pressure can purge grains from gas ( see also eisner , chiang , & hillenbrand  2006 ) .",
    "sub - micron - sized grains around solar - type stars feel an outward stellar radiation force that just exceeds stellar gravity .",
    "then the time for such grains to travel from @xmath14 to @xmath0@xmath175 is @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the time for grains of radius @xmath80 and internal density @xmath178 to attain terminal velocity according to the epstein gas drag law , which applies here because the grain size is smaller than the collisional mean free path in gas ( e.g. , weidenschilling 1977 ) .",
    "radiation blow - out is faster than aerodynamic drift ( the latter caused by radial pressure gradients in gas ; e.g. , alexander & armitage 2007 ) by @xmath179 , and so we ignore the latter .",
    "we compare @xmath180 to @xmath181 , the time for gas to diffuse from @xmath14 to @xmath0@xmath182 . at the rim of the disk of gm aur ,",
    "the timescales match by coincidence : @xmath183 .",
    "this indicates that about half of the dust in @xmath143 is expelled , leaving the other half entrained with accreting gas and spread between @xmath2 and @xmath0@xmath53 .",

    "because radiation at a wavelength of @xmath186 originates from grains having temperatures of @xmath0300 k , observed @xmath186 spectra of gm aur constrain the optical depth in grains at @xmath01 au but not near the rim at 24 au , where starlight - heated grains would have colder temperatures of @xmath0100 k. therefore we can not directly compare our calculated @xmath185 with @xmath186 observations for gm aur .    for the case of tw hyd",
    ", however , we can more easily make this comparison , because its rim is located at @xmath04 au . scaling to the parameters of that system , we find @xmath187 and @xmath188 , which suggests that somewhat more than half of the dust in @xmath143 is expelled .",
    "reducing our estimate in ( [ tau ] ) by an additional factor of 2 , and accounting for the smaller aspect ratio @xmath189 , we estimate @xmath190 for tw hyd .",
    "observationally , the vertical optical depth of dust interior to the rim of tw hydra s disk is @xmath191 at a wavelength of @xmath186 ( c02 ) .",
    "this is essentially the same as the geometric optical depth for micron - sized grains because of the silicate resonance band at @xmath186 wavelength .",
    "thus , our crude estimate of @xmath190 , based on assumed values for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , is within a factor of two of the observed optical depth .",
    "such approximate agreement we consider acceptable , and helps to justify our choice earlier for @xmath192 in calculating the grain recombination coefficient @xmath79 (  [ ionbal ] ) .    to satisfy the observation that the disk remain optically thin at @xmath30",
    ", the order - half of rim dust that lies between @xmath2 and @xmath53 must fail to penetrate inside @xmath193 .",
    "radiation pressure ensures that dust does not continue to inspiral , provided that @xmath194 decrease with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "this seems likely to obtain because @xmath13 should drop sharply just inside @xmath53 once midplane gas becomes too dense to be heated effectively by x - rays .",
    "unfortunately , a conclusive statement can not be made without constructing a model that smoothly bridges conditions at @xmath195 with conditions at @xmath30 .",
    "this would require knowing in detail how gas heats and cools at all radii .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ sum ] and discuss topics for future research in  [ unresolved ] .",
    "how do t tauri disks accrete ?",
    "we have answered this longstanding question for the sub - class of objects known as transitional systems , disks having au - sized or larger inner holes cleared of dust .",
    "super - kev x - rays , emitted by the young star as a consequence of its enhanced dynamo , irradiate the inner disk rim .",
    "a portion of the rim is sufficiently ionized that it becomes unstable to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) and diffuses inward .",
    "the mri , sustained even at the disk midplane by hard x - rays , transports gas steadily from the rim all the way to the stellar surface .",
    "we infer transport parameters @xmath1 on the order of a percent ; such values are indeed yielded by the mri , according to contemporary numerical simulations .",
    "we feel the following features of our theory deserve emphasis .    1",
    ".   _ accretion rate vs.  hole size . _ all other factors ( e.g. , x - ray luminosity , stellar mass , free atomic metal abundance ) being equal , the accretion rate @xmath29 should increase nearly as the square of the rim radius @xmath2 , simply from the increased surface area of the rim wall that is exposed to stellar x - rays .",
    "late - breaking data ( c.  espaillat , personal communication ) for the transitional disks cs cha ( @xmath196 , @xmath197 ) and sz 18 ( @xmath198 , @xmath199 ) appear to support this trend of @xmath29 with @xmath2 as plotted in our figure 4 .",
    "of course , this trend is expected to apply only for transitional disks for which @xmath200 au ( see the last issue raised in  [ unresolved ] ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion vs.  ohmic dissipation .",
    "_ often it is assumed that ohmic dissipation controls where the mri can and can not operate .",
    "this criterion , embodied in equation ( [ re ] ) through the magnetic reynolds number @xmath201 , assigns importance to @xmath15 , the ratio of the density of the most mobile charge carriers ( electrons ) to that of resistive species ( neutral h@xmath20 molecules ) .",
    "large values of @xmath202 imply that magnetic flux is frozen into plasma , enabling the background shear flow to amplify magnetic fields .",
    "+ we have shown instead that ambipolar diffusion , not ohmic dissipation , dictates the boundaries of mri - active zones .",
    "magnetic flux can be perfectly frozen into plasma ; yet if the neutrals do not couple mechanically to the plasma , the neutrals would be immune to the mri .",
    "protoplanetary disk gas is overwhelmingly neutral .",
    "thus , as equation ( [ am ] ) states , a given neutral h@xmath20 molecule must collide with as many ( momentum - bearing ) ions as possible within a dynamical time for the mri to afflict protoplanetary disk gas .",
    "ambipolar diffusion limits the accretion flow from the rim , and is only marginally defeated at the midplane far inside the rim .",
    "+ while we have demonstrated that criterion ( [ am ] ) outweighs ( [ re ] ) only for transitional disks , we suspect the same conclusion holds for conventional t tauri disks as well .",
    "for example , consider figure 7 of ig99 , which seeks to describe the depth of the mri - active layer in disks without holes .",
    "at , say , @xmath203 , at the bottom of the supposedly active layer of their model , the number density is @xmath204 . by ig99 s equation ( 23 ) , the ionization fraction there is @xmath205 ( for their standard @xmath206 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath207 .",
    "this falls four orders of magnitude short of the critical @xmath208 seemingly demanded by numerical simulations ( mac low et al .",
    "1995 ; hawley & stone 1998 ) .",
    "therefore we disagree with ig99 s determination of the depth of the active layer ; their layer does not satisfy criterion ( [ am ] ) .",
    "+ because the ambipolar diffusion criterion ( [ am ] ) assigns importance to the total ion density rather than the fractional electron density , it is hardest to satisfy in the most rarefied regions of disks , either at large vertical heights or large radial distance .",
    "this is just opposite to what has been concluded in the literature , that mri - active zones are restricted to the surfaces and the outermost portions of disks .",
    "_ disk properties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside , since the mri can only draw a radial column of @xmath209 from the rim at any time . in other words , unlike the usual situation , estimating @xmath29 does not require specifying the detailed surface density profile of the disk @xmath60 ; we need only know those rim - specific variables in equation ( [ m_dot ] ) : @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 .",
    "our picture therefore provides a robust setting for theories of how planets form and how their orbits evolve ( e.g. , goldreich & sari 2003 ) within transitional disks .",
    "a protoplanet lying interior to the rim will interact with gas whose density , temperature , and transport properties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions .",
    "4 .   _ how disks dissipate .",
    "_ our study also supplies part of the answer to how disks dissipate . excepting matter that gets locked into planets , the inner disk drains from the inside out by the mri , while material beyond the rim photoevaporates by stellar ultraviolet radiation ( alexander , clarke , & pringle 2006ab ) .",
    "indeed , the models of alexander et al .",
    "( 2006ab ) require the disk inside a few aus to drain onto the star before ultraviolet radiation can photoevaporate the outer disk efficiently .",
    "their analysis did not specify the means by which the inner disk evacuates .",
    "our work identifies the mechanism : it is the mri , leaching material from the disk rim and causing the inner hole to grow .",
    "how long the mri takes to eat its way out depends on the unknown surface density @xmath59 of the original disk . the clearing time @xmath212",
    "if @xmath213 at @xmath214 , comparable to that of the minimum - mass solar nebula .        1 .",
    "_ radiation blow - out .",
    "_ we have established that a fraction on the order of 50% of the sub - micron - sized grains in the mri - active rim gets blown back into the rim by stellar radiation pressure .",
    "the remaining fraction , which gets entrained to @xmath0@xmath53 by the accretion flow , ultimately must also be blown back to ensure that transitional disk holes stay as transparent as observed . to prove this last point requires understanding in detail how gas heats and cools at all radii from @xmath2 to the stellar surface , and checking that @xmath194 decreases with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "self - shadowing .",
    "_ throughout this work we have assumed for simplicity that the accretion disk interior to the rim does not obstruct the rim wall from stellar x - rays . yet there must be some self - shadowing , which if sufficiently severe will convert the problem we have solved to one involving surface irradiation and the two - dimensional radiative transfer of x - rays ( ig99 ) . even if this were the case , however , midplane gas at the rim may still be mri - active by virtue of x - rays that compton scatter downward from the disk surface ( ig99 ;  [ steady ] ) .",
    "+ the rim might be tall enough that a good fraction of its lowermost vertical scale height escapes being shadowed . in our picture ,",
    "rim gas is optically thin to x - rays , and is therefore well - heated by them ( see also glassgold et al .",
    "this source of heating is not enjoyed by midplane gas in the inner disk , which is optically thick to x - rays .",
    "thus we envision a sharp drop in temperature and a concomitant drop in disk thickness just inside the rim . as was the case for radiation blow - out , addressing the problem of self - shadowing requires a global treatment of thermal balance .",
    "the value of @xmath1 .",
    "_ we have estimated that @xmath1 s on the order of a percent are required to explain the accretion rates of gm aur , tw hyd , and dm tau .",
    "such values are observed in numerical simulations of the mri under certain assumptions about the magnitude and geometry of the seed magnetic field .",
    "are these assumptions justified ? what sets the seed field parameters ? and how far can one trust the simulations themselves ? + using vertically unstratified simulations performed by sano et al .",

    "values of @xmath220 correspond to @xmath221 , or equivalently a plasma @xmath222 .",
    "is such a background state realistic ?",
    "can one determine analogous requirements based on simulations that assume a net toroidal field , and ultimately on simulations that include vertical gravity ?",
    "4 .   _ the value of @xmath26 . _",
    "is @xmath26 truly and exactly 100 ?",
    "what is the origin of this dimensionless number ?",
    "how sharp is criterion ( [ am ] ) in predicting the non - linear outcome of the mri ? according to our present calculations , criterion ( [ am ] ) for @xmath208 is only marginally satisfied at the rim and interior to the rim .",
    "we need to know the transport parameter @xmath1 as a function of @xmath123 ( see also point 3 above ) to calculate more precisely the rate of gas flow from the rim .",
    "the value of @xmath223 .",
    "_ how can one measure the abundance of gas - phase atomic metals in transitional disks ?",
    "our finding that the mri is viable depends on having more than 1 out of every @xmath0300 metal atoms such as magnesium remaining in the atomic gas phase .",
    "these free metals provide the ions that collisionally couple the neutrals to the mri .",
    "6 .   _ aerosols .",
    "_ what is the abundance of macromolecules / grains having sizes @xmath0@xmath224 to @xmath0@xmath225 and is it large enough to interfere with the standard electron - driven chemistry we have presented ?",
    "on the optimistic side , transitional disks are observed to have much less micron - sized dust than conventional t tauri disks .",
    "we have calculated that fractional electron densities in the rim are large enough to withstand , to some degree , the effects of electron adsorption and ion recombination onto grains . on the other hand ,",
    "radiation pressure can not purge gas of small aerosols because of their short aerodynamic stopping times and low efficiencies for intercepting radiation .",
    ".   _ accretion rate vs.  x - ray luminosity . _",
    "any mature theory of x - ray - driven mri should predict @xmath29 as a function of @xmath226 . but without knowing @xmath227 ( see points 3 and 4 above ) , we can not derive this relation with confidence . at the very least @xmath29 must increase with @xmath226 .",
    "is there observational evidence for such a trend ?",
    "in fact , @xmath29 is known to increase with @xmath61 ( e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "2006 ) . and @xmath226 is observed to increase with @xmath61 ( guedel et al .  2007 ; telleschi et al .",
    "but frustratingly enough , when @xmath29 is plotted against @xmath226 , whatever trend might be present is obscured by large scatter ( telleschi et al .  2007 ) .",
    "+ a shorter - term project would be to measure the hard , @xmath37 spectra of individual sources .",
    "the penetration depth of x - rays scales strongly with photon energy , as @xmath228 .",
    "_ from conventional t tauri disks to transitional disks .",
    "_ we have studied the equilibrium dynamics of transitional disks but have said little regarding origin .",
    "presumably transitional disks evolve from conventional t tauri disks .",
    "are transitional systems , as a group , older ?",
    "the age of tw hyd is estimated to be approximately 10 myr , which indeed is old for a t tauri star . + how does the evolution from conventional t tauri to transition system take place ?",
    "unfortunately , we can not answer this question by merely extrapolating our theory to earlier times .",
    "our theory is designed to explain systems with large , well - defined holes , and would break down as @xmath2 approaches the stellar radius , if only because rim gas would be ionized thermally rather than by x - rays .",
    "data for conventional t tauri disks clearly do not fit the relations plotted in figure 4 ; their rim radii are on the order of @xmath00.1 au but their accretion rates range up to @xmath0@xmath229",
    ". the origin of transitional disks will likely remain a mystery until we solve the decades - old puzzle of how conventional t tauri disks , objects without large holes , accrete ( see , e.g. , hartmann et al .",
    "the solution might involve some combination of the mri plus gravitational instability ( e.g. , g96 ) .",
    "we thank al glassgold , david hollenbach , uma gorti , eric feigelson , martin pessah , catherine espaillat , joanna brown , and colette salyk for informative discussions .",
