    "in lorentzian geometry , the spaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 containing , resp . , all the causal and timelike curves connecting two causally related points @xmath2 become of crucial interest . in particular , it is well - known that globally hyperbolic spacetimes can be characterized as those causal spacetimes where all the spaces @xmath0 become compact for a suitable topology ( see the review @xcite ) ; moreover , in these spacetimes , each space @xmath0 always contains an element ( necessarily a causal pregeodesic ) with maximum length .",
    "it is also natural to consider topological properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , such as their classes of homotopy and , more properly in the lorentzian context , the classes of _ causal _ or _ timelike _ homotopies , where the homotopy is mediated via paths ( the _ longitudinal curves _ of the homotopy ) that also lie in @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the purpose of the present note is _ to exhibit examples of globally hyperbolic spacetimes where @xmath0 and @xmath1 contain infinitely many classes of causal and timelike homotopy , resp . _",
    "the examples are robust , i.e. , independent of details such as dimensions , the global topology of the manifold or the existence of symmetries ( the latter appear just to make easier computations ) .",
    "moreover , they do not rely on any `` mathematical trick '' about the smoothability of the considered curves .",
    "indeed , the regularity of the curves will be optimal , in the sense that the infinitely many non - homotopic curves to be obtained will be @xmath3 differentiable , but each two of these curves will not be connected by a causal homotopy even if the longitudinal curves of the possible homotopies are allowed to be just causal - continuous ( the minimum regularity allowed for causal curves , see the section of preliminaries ) .",
    "even though quite a few of properties of these causal homotopy classes are known ( see for example @xcite ) , we are not aware of such a type of examples . as we will see , they allow for an interesting comparison with the finiteness of the ( purely topological ) homotopy classes for causal curves joining two points ( which was established in @xcite ) , and they also allow for a better understanding of some subtleties related to the existence of either an _ arbitrary close causal curve _ or a _",
    "variation by causal curves_.    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after some precise definitions on homotopy classes and a technical preliminary lemma concerning brouwer s topological degree in section [ s2 ] , the examples are constructed in section [ s3 ] .",
    "the construction of the examples is rather intuitive and easy to understand ; nevertheless , the formal proof of the intended properties is not so trivial , as it requires implicitly the previous topological tools included in section [ s2 ] .",
    "the example for causal homotopy classes is described first , while the case of timelike homotopy classes will be a ( somewhat burdensome ) modification of the previous one .",
    "finally , in section [ topologicalanddiscuss ] we compare these examples with the result in @xcite about ( purely topological ) homotopies , and in section [ lastsect ] a discussion on related questions and physical interpretations is carried out .",
    "we will follow usual conventions as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 denotes a spacetime , i.e. a time - oriented connected lorentzian manifold . for points",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , which are causally related ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath0 will denote the set of all the future - directed causal - continuous ( called non - spacelike in @xcite ) curves @xmath8\\rightarrow m$ ] from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "let us recall this concept , which is a natural generalization of the typical notions of _ causal _ for smooth curves , and can be also found in classical references such as @xcite .",

    "it is well - known that these curves , even if non - smooth , can be assumed to be parametrized so that they are locally lipschitz ( and globally lipschitz for any auxiliary riemannian metric , as @xmath19 $ ] is compact ) and , thus , absolutely continuous and almost everywhere differentiable ( cf .",

    "we consider a prescribed interval @xmath19 $ ] ( which could be taken equal to @xmath20 $ ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath1 will denote the subset of @xmath0 containing its piecewise - smooth @xmath21 timelike curves .",
    "such orders of regularity will be the most appropriate for the robustness of our examples , since the assumed low regularity for causal curves ( which permits homotopies with low regularity too ) , will not avoid the existence of infinitely many causal homotopy classes , each one containing smooth curves .",
    "moreover , the smooth timelike curves in infinitely many different timelike homotopy classes to be constructed will also remain in different causal homotopy classes ( recall that , in general , a single causal homotopy class may have more than one timelike homotopy class ) .    specifically , a",

    "we explain how this result will be subsequently used as an essential part to check the properties of our examples .",
    "first , recall the following intuitive consequence of brouwer s degree theory ( cf .",

    "for each @xmath41 $ ] elementary bolzano theorem ensures the existence of at least one @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "theorem [ brouwerdegree ] goes further ensuring that such points @xmath47 ( which appear in red ) include a connected set @xmath48 ( in bold red ) which connects the vertical lines @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "when applied to lemma [ lemma ] , @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent the polar angle of the endpoints of the longitudinal curves in the homotopy . ]",
    "let us apply this theorem in order to prove the ( simple ) property of the sphere stated in lemma [ lemma ] .",
    "let @xmath53 be the usual 2-sphere of radius 1 , and use spherical coordinates @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , with polar @xmath57 , and azimuth @xmath58 .",
    "the meridian non - covered by these coordinates will be denoted @xmath59 ; however , the polar map @xmath60 is well - defined and continuous everywhere . in the sequel , @xmath61 will denote the equator , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 the north and south poles .",
    "[ lemma ] let @xmath64\\to { \\mathbb{s}}^2 $ ] be curves from @xmath65 to @xmath66 which parametrize , resp . , the meridians of azimuthal angles @xmath67 , @xmath68 for some @xmath69 .",
    "let @xmath23\\times [ 0,\\pi ] \\to { \\mathbb{s}}^2 $ ] be a ( topological ) homotopy connecting @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "then , the image of @xmath28 contains at least one of the two following sets : @xmath72    putting @xmath73\\times [ 0,\\pi]\\to { \\mathds r}$ ] , one has a continuous function with@xmath74$}.\\ ] ] then , theorem [ brouwerdegree ] provides a connected subset @xmath48 of @xmath75 that intersects @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 is a connected subset of @xmath79 which contains points of azimuthal angle @xmath67 and @xmath80 , and the result follows ( lift and extend continuously the coordinate @xmath81 to the natural covering @xmath82 ) .",
    "[ r2.4 ] of course , the previous lemma can be improved because , as one would expect , even if the intersections with @xmath79 are not taken in and , one of the two regions delimited by meridians would be included in the image of @xmath28 .",
    "however , this would prolong the proof was used for each parallel @xmath83 as done for @xmath79 , then one should justify that the same region @xmath84 or @xmath85 can be chosen with independence of @xmath86 . ] and will not be necessary .",
    "what we would like to stress is that , at least for the examples below , a kind of topological discussion becomes necessary .",
    "indeed , the application of lemma [ lemma ] in the next section will ensure ( rigorously ) that either the piece or the piece of the equator must be swept when one meridian is deformed continuously into another .",
    "as we will see , such a piece will be used to introduce an appropriate conformal factor on the sphere .",
    "the latter will force some longitudinal curves of any homotopy in @xmath87 between the meridians to have a length bigger than @xmath88 , and this property will imply the required inexistence of causal homotopies between some lightlike geodesics in the spacetime @xmath89 .",

    "recall that , from a mathematical viewpoint , one says that a causal spacetime contains a _ naked singularity _ when it admits two points @xmath279 such that @xmath282 is not compact ( so that a causal spacetime is said globally hyperbolic when it does not contain naked singularities ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this property is as follows .",
    "if @xmath282 is not compact then it contains a nonconvergent sequence of points @xmath283 and , thus , any sequence of paths @xmath281 each one starting at @xmath9 , crossing @xmath284 and ending at @xmath10 satisfy : there exist a limit path @xmath285 that starts at @xmath9 but it can not arrive at @xmath10 ( as well as a dual one @xmath286 ending at @xmath10 but which can not start at @xmath9 ) .",
    "this impossibility to arrive means that @xmath285 `` disappears '' from the spacetime ( i.e @xmath285 arrives to some sort of singularity ) and , moreover , this disappearance can be observed from @xmath10 ( the singularity is naked ) .",
    "one could expect that the path @xmath285 were reachable continuously from paths @xmath137 but this was known to be false . in fact , one could think that the failure of this property was also a consequence of the existence of the singularity . however , as we have seen , this is not the case : even when a spacetime is free of naked singularities , a path @xmath212 obtained as a limit curve of paths @xmath137 may be non - reachable continuously from any @xmath137 .",
    "\\(5 ) a worthy property , known by riemannian specialists , holds for the riemannian part of our second example .",
    "namely , in the first example , the meridian of azimuthal angle @xmath287 from @xmath65 to @xmath66 attains both , its first conjugate and cut point , at @xmath66 . nevertheless , in the second one , its first conjugate point is still @xmath66 , but there exists a previous cut point , since meridians @xmath201 are shorter curves connecting @xmath65 with @xmath66",
    "moreover , the cut point approaches the first conjugate point when one consider small neighboords of the half lune delimited by @xmath125 and each @xmath134 .",
