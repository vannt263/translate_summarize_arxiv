    "the loewner equation describes a rather general class of growth processes in two dimensions where a curve starts from a given point on the boundary of a domain @xmath0 in the complex @xmath1-plane and grows into the interior of @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , the loewner equation @xcite is a first - order differential equation for the conformal mapping @xmath2 from the ` physical domain , ' consisting of the region @xmath0 minus the curve , onto a ` mathematical domain ' represented by @xmath0 itself .",
    "the specific form of the loewner equation depends both on the domain @xmath0 and on the point where the trace ends .",
    "the most studied cases are the chordal and radial loewner equations @xcite , where in the former case the trace ends on a given point on the boundary , while in the latter it ends on a point in the interior .",
    "other geometries such as the dipolar case @xcite and the channel geometry @xcite have also been considered in the literature .",
    "the loewner equation depends explicitly on a driving function , here denoted by @xmath3 , which is the image of the growing tip under the mapping @xmath2 .",
    "an important development in the field was the discovery by schramm @xcite that when @xmath3 is a brownian motion the resulting loewner evolution describes the scaling limit of certain statistical mechanics models .",
    "this result spurred great interest in the so - called stochastic loewner equation ( sle ) and the subject has now been widely reviewed , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "although the sle has attracted most of the attention lately , the deterministic version of the loewner equation remains of considerable interest both in a purely mathematical context @xcite and in connection with applications to growth processes @xcite and integrable systems theory @xcite .",
    "indeed , the deterministic loewner equation has been used to study laplacian fingered - growth in both the chordal and radial cases @xcite as well as in the channel geometry @xcite . in this class of models",
    ", growth takes place only at the tips of slit - like fingers and the driving function @xmath3 has to follow a specific time evolution in order to ensure that the tip grows along gradient lines of the corresponding laplacian field .",
    "although this thin - finger model @xcite was able to reproduce some of the qualitative behavior seen in experiments @xcite , treating the fingers as infinitesimally thin is a rather severe approximation .",
    "more recently , the growth of `` extended fingers '' @xcite or `` fat slits '' @xcite , meaning a domain encircled by an interface with endpoints on the real axis , was considered within the formalism of deterministic loewner evolutions in the upper half - plane . in particular , the interface growth model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite was shown to exhibit interesting dynamical features akin to the finger competition mechanism observed in actual laplacian growth @xcite .",
    "many growth processes , however , take place in a bounded domain , e.g. , within a channel @xcite , for which a loewner - equation approach was still lacking . to develop a formalism based on loewner evolutions to describe",
    "the growth of an interface in the channel geometry is thus the main goal of the present study .",
    "because the loewner function @xmath2 fixes the points @xmath4 ( the channel corners ) and @xmath5 ( the channel ` open ' end ) , we shall refer to growth processes in the channel geometry as _ tripolar _ loewner evolutions , to distinguish it from the dipolar case where two points are kept fixed @xcite .",
    "we begin our analysis by revisiting in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] the problem of fingered growth in the channel geometry , where a curve ( finger ) grows from a point on the real axis into a semi - infinite channel .",
    "we present a brief derivation of the corresponding tripolar loewner and report a new class of exact solutions for the case of multiple fingers with stationary driving functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we then discuss a general class of models where a domain , bounded by an interface , grows into a channel starting from a segment on the real axis . in our model , the growth rate is specified at a certain number of special points on the interface , referred to as _ tips _ and _ troughs _ , which then determine the growth rate at the other points of the interface according to a specific growth rule ( formulated in terms of a polygonal curve in the mathematical plane ) .",
    "a generalized tripolar loewner equation for this problem is derived and several examples are given in which the interface evolution is obtained by a direct numerical integration of the loewner equation .",

    "we shall consider for simplicity only cases in which @xmath200 we expect nevertheless that the qualitative behavior seen in this simpler situation ( see below ) should also be valid in more general cases . as a first example , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] a symmetrical growing interface , where the dashed lines represent the trajectories of the tips and the trough . in this figure",
    ", we started with symmetrical initial conditions , namely , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , and chose the growth factors of the two tips to be the same , @xmath204 , so as to preserve the initial symmetry , with the trough growth factor being @xmath205 .    if we break the symmetry , either by choosing an asymmetric initial condition or using different growth factors for the tips , then inevitably of the tips will grow faster and `` screen '' the other tip .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] we show a situation where the growth factors are the same as in fig .  [ fig:8 ] but the initial segment from which the interface grows is off - center , namely , @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 . in this case , the tip closest to the right channel wall grows slower and falls behind the other tip . here , however , the screening is partial in the sense that the slower tip continues to grow but with a velocity that is a fraction of that of the faster tip .",
    "( total screening , whereby the slowest tip eventually stops growing altogether , can be observed if the faster tip has a sufficiently large growth factor . )       for each interface .",

    "( [ eq : l ] ) can also describe the problem of multiple growing interfaces in the channel geometry . in this case each interface @xmath213 , for @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the number of distinct interfaces , will be mapped under @xmath2 to a corresponding interval on the real axis in the @xmath8-plane .",
    "similarly , each advanced interface @xmath216 is mapped by @xmath2 to a polygonal curve in the @xmath8-plane .",
    "one can readily convince oneself that the generic loewner evolution defined by ( [ eq : l ] ) and ( [ eq : dotai ] ) applies to this case as well , where @xmath123 is now the total number of vertices corresponding to the sum of the number of vertices for each interface .",
    "note that for each interface we have conditions analogous to ( [ eq : sumd ] ) and ( [ eq : sumd2 ] ) , but involving only the growth factors @xmath169 of the respective interface .",
    "but the initial segments from which the interface starts to grow were shifted to the right.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] we show numerical solutions for two growing symmetrical interfaces , with one tip each , where the interfaces are the images of one another with respect to the @xmath217 axis . here",

    "( the interfaces have the same growing factors , meaning that @xmath219 . )",
    "notice that , as time goes by , the inner sides of the two interfaces move towards one another leaving a narrow channel between them . for sufficiently large time , the width of such a channel becomes infinitesimally small so that for all practical purposes the resulting evolution will look like a single , symmetrical interface .",
    "if the symmetry between the two interfaces is broken , then one of them will eventually move ahead of the other one .",
    "for instance , in fig .  [ fig:13 ]",
    "we show the case in which the growth factors are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] but the initial positions of the interfaces are no longer symmetric with respect to the channel centerline . in this case , the interface closer to the centerline is the  winner , \" in the sense that its tips moves ahead of the tip of the second interface .",
    "this competition between the two growing interfaces resembles the so - called  shadowing effect \" in fingering phenomena , whereby the longer fingers grow faster and hinder the growth of the shorter ones in their vicinities .",
    "we have discussed a class of growth models in the channel geometry where the growth dynamics is described in terms of tripolar loewner evolutions . in the tripolar geometry ,",
    "the loewner mapping fixes the points @xmath4 and the point at infinity .",
    "the growing domain starts from a point ( in the case of a curve ) or from an interval ( in the case of a domain bounded by an interface ) on the real axis , ending at infinity ( for infinite time ) .",
    "in particular , a novel class of exact solutions of the tripolar loewner equation for multiple curves was obtained for the case of stationary driving functions . as for the more difficult problem of interface growth in the channel geometry",
    ", we introduced a generalized tripolar loewner equation and presented several numerical solutions , including the case of an interface with multiple tips as well as the case of multiple interfaces .",
    "it was argued that the behavior seen in the model is reminiscent of the phenomenon of tip / finger competition observed in fingering experiments .",
    "a natural extension of the work presented here would be to consider the problem of tripolar stochastic loewner equation ( sle ) and investigate its connection with statistical mechanics models and conformal field theory .",
    "although stochastic growth processes were not considered in this paper , it is nonetheless hoped that a better understanding of deterministic loewner evolutions in the channel geometry , which was the main thrust of our study , may be of some help in tackling the more difficult problem of tripolar sles . another possible direction for future",
    "work would be to consider more general geometries , such as `` quadripolar '' loewner evolutions where four points are kept fixed .",
    "this geometry would be of interest in connection , for instance , with growth processes in doubly periodic domains ."
