    "40004000  = 1000              gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are associated with the deaths of massive stars , as seen first in their association with blue galaxies @xcite ; the appearance of supernovae explosion ( sne ) -like lightcurves at late times @xcite ; and the recent convincing observation of a sne spectrum associated with a grb afterglow @xcite .",
    "however , what differentiates grbs from the 10@xmath3 more frequently observed core - collapse , or type - ii , sne remains uncertain .",
    "recently , it was reported ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cb03 hereafter ) that 8020% polarization in the prompt , or burst , gamma - rays of grb021206 was detected using the spectroscopic imager @xcite on board the _ rhessi _  satellite @xcite . although not designed for gamma - ray polarization measurements of grbs , the multiple detectors of _ rhessi _",
    "were used to search for simultaneous events in two detectors due to compton scattering , which then give a preferred scattering direction projected on the sky .",
    "an excess of scattered events in a particular direction on the sky was interpreted as due to angle - dependent scattering associated with intrinsic polarization of the gamma - ray photons .",
    "such a high polarization fraction in the gamma - rays may require a large - scale persistent magnetic field  of a strength observed thus far only from neutron stars , in particular the magnetars which are believed to account for 10% of the observed ns population . if this property of grbs is confirmed in future observations",
    ", then polarization would strongly constrain grb production models , and may provide important input physics to understanding the generalized sne phenomena .",
    "the reported detection has led to the wide discussion of mechanisms for producing the high polarization , which would constrain the emission and progenitor models @xcite , and has prompted discussion of detector development to better observe gamma - ray polarization @xcite .",
    "the analysis of cb03 used a mass - model for the _ rhessi _  satellite to calculate the satellite response to an unpolarized beam , in order to calculate the unpolarized lightcurve .",
    "it is first needed to calculate the `` null '' lightcurve ( that is , the lightcurve of an unpolarized grb ) to demonstrate detection .",
    "it is also needed to correct the detected signal , and dominates the error bar in the measurement of 8020% polarization .",
    "we describe the observation in  [ sec : obs ] , and give an overview of the analysis by cb03 in  [ sec : cb03 ] .",
    "to produce the polarization measurement , it is necessary that photons scattered between two detectors be observed in the data , and in  [ sec : double ] we estimate the number of observed scattered double - count events , finding it to be a factor of 10 lower than the previous estimate . in ",
    "[ sec : singlecounts ] , we examine the distribution of single counts and double counts as a function of the instantaneous position of the detectors where the counts are detected , and find that , while both single- and double- counts exhibit strong dependencies on this position , their ratio does not , suggesting the absence of a signal due to polarization . we nonetheless describe in  [ sec : anal ] a polarization detection analysis suitable for _ rhessi _  data which is limited in its sensitivity by poisson statistics ( that is , not dependent upon the space - craft mass model ) and apply it to the observation of grb  021206 , deriving a correction which accounts for the angle - dependent klein - nishina cross section in  [ sec : kn ] .",
    "the results of the polarization analysis are discussed in  [ sec : results ] , finding no evidence for a signal which could be due to polarized gamma - ray photons from grb  021206 . in  [ sec : bad ] , we reproduce the modulation reported by cb03 , finding that the reported signal is not observed using the new method , which does not rely upon the monte carlo radiative transfer through the _ rhessi _  mass model . in  [ sec : con ] we summarize our results , compare them with those of cb03 and conclude .      the observation of grb  021206  is described by cb03 .",
    "we recount pertinent information .",
    "the _ rhessi _  satellite is a gamma - ray imager primarily for solar observations using a rotation modulated collimator .",
    "it is in a low - earth orbit , with its imaging ( z ) axis staring within a few arc - minutes of the solar center .",
    "the entire satellite rotates approximately around this @xmath4 axis clockwise from north , with a period of @xmath54 seconds .",
    "the _ rhessi _  spectrometer detectors are an array of 9 separate , effectively identical detectors , each a cylinder roughly 7.1 cm diameter .",
    "each detector is electronically separated into two segments ( `` front '' and `` rear '' ) which have slightly different photon energy responses .",
    "a diagram of the detectors and their orientation within the spacecraft detector plane is given in @xcite .",
    "we give a similar diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : spex ] , and the mass - model coordinate centers of the detectors in table  [ tab : spex ] .",
    "the approximate start time of grb021206 measured with _ rhessi _  was 2002-dec-06 22:49:16 ut . the best gamma - ray localization of grb021206 was found @xcite to be an error ellipse centered at r.a.=240.195 deg ( 16h00m46.8s ) , dec.=@xmath29.710 deg ( @xmath209d42m36s)(j2000 ) , with a major axis of 20.4and a minor axis of 0.53 , position angle of -18   ( relative to the positive direction of declination ) .",
    "we adopt the position of a related radio transient @xcite .    at the time of the transient , the solar location was about r.a.=16h53m20.15s , dec.=-22d32m47.7s .",
    "the grb was localized at an angle @xmath6  clockwise from n of the sun , and offset from the direction of solar center by 17.98 .",
    "counts detected with the _ rhessi _  spectrometer are timestamped with resolution of @xmath7 s , or 1 binary micro - sec ( ) ; the detector segment ; and photon energy .",
    "a double - count scattering event takes place when a gamma - ray photon makes a single scatter off of detector @xmath8 , producing a count in that detector , then leaving that detector to be partially or fully absorbed in a second detector @xmath9 , producing a simultaneous count in detector @xmath9 .",
    "a double - count coincidence event , which appears identical to a double - count scattering event , takes place when two unrelated photons produce simultaneous counts in two different detectors .",
    "a single - count event takes place when a single photon is fully or partially absorbed in a detector @xmath8 , but is not followed by a detection in another detector within some period of time @xmath10 as measured by the on - board clock .",
    "when a double - count event is registered , the position angle on the sky ( @xmath11 ) of the line joining the centers of the detector pair is determined . from this , a lightcurve of double count events as a function of @xmath11 was produced .",
    "cb03 produced a null double - count event lightcurve to be subtracted from the observed lightcurve by monte carlo simulation ( s. boggs , w. coburn , priv .",
    "comm . ) . they simulated @xmath518,000,000 photons propagating through the spacecraft from the direction of the grb , to produce a library of double - event scatters between detectors .    following this subtraction , a sinusoidal modulation in the difference lightcurve",
    "was found , which was significantly different from a constant value .",
    "based on this sinusoidal residual , cb03 concluded that the incoming gamma - ray beam was polarized . using the scattering fractions found with the geant mass model ,",
    "the magnitude of the modulation was corrected to find the intrinsic polarization magnitude of 8020% .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by uncertainty in the geant mass model .      to estimate the sensitivity of the _ rhessi _  spectrometer to gamma - ray polarization ,",
    "it is critical to establish the presence and estimate the number of two - detector scattering events in the data , and to minimize , and also estimate , the level of contaminating two - detector backgrounds .",
    "it is possible to analyze the _ rhessi _  data for evidence of a polarization signature without investigating these effects . in",
    "most but not all cases ( see  6 ) , double - count event backgrounds will dilute the angular modulation signal but will not generate an angularly - modulated signal of their own , and thus will not mimic the effects of genuine gamma - ray polarization .",
    "however , even when modulation can be detected in this fashion , estimating the number of two - detector scatters and associated backgrounds still allows a valuable consistency check of the analysis to be made . moreover , converting a detection of modulation to an estimate of the polarization signal strength requires an accurate estimate of the signal and background .",
    "cb03 present estimates of the number of two - detector scatter events and backgrounds in their `` methods '' section .",
    "they find @xmath1 two - detector scatters , and estimate a background of @xmath12 two - detector coincidences and @xmath13 `` background scatter '' events , for a total of 14916 double - count events detected .",
    "the meaning of the `` background scatter '' category is not defined but would seem to refer to scattering events attributable to background sources other than grb  021206  itself .",
    "they also state that the number of two - detector scatter events is `` roughly 10% of the total 0.152.0  mev light - curve events , '' and that this proportion is in agreement with the results from their monte carlo simulations ; the nature and degree of this agreement is not quantified .    in this section",
    "we make a model - independent investigation of the fraction of two - detector scatter events in the _ rhessi _  data for grb  021206 .",
    "in particular , we determine the number of two - detector events which are due to events of each of the following types : ( a ) scattered events , which produce two counts in two different detectors from a single scattered photon ; ( b ) the coincident arrival of two unrelated photons in two different detectors ; ( c ) scattered events , which produce two events in the same detector ; and ( d ) events which take place in different detectors due to a detector effect .",
    "for the polarization measurement , events of type ( a ) permit measurement of polarization ; type ( b ) is the irreducible background ; and types ( c ) and ( d ) are background which , in principle , can be identified by their non - poissonian nature and removed from the data .      as a first step ,",
    "we examine the timing properties of _ rhessi_spectrometer data to establish an appropriate definition for selection of `` simultaneous '' events .",
    "we find that it is necessary to accept events within a time window of 5  to avoid discarding simultaneous events .",
    "[ fig : diffdt]a is a histogram of wait times between timestamps of consecutive counts ( @xmath10 ) ; for a pure poisson process  not the present case , because of the strong variations in the grb mean count rate  this histogram will exhibit the classical exponential form .",
    "we observe a clear non - poissonian excess near @xmath14 , that is , at @xmath10 greater than zero . since the light - travel time for 2  is 570 m , far larger than the separations between detectors , this can not be a physical effect , but rather must be due to behavior of the detector electronics , with simultaneous events not receiving identical timestamps .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffdt]b we have removed the 6732 event pairs which take place either simultaneously or consecutively ( with no intervening counts ) in the same detector ; the front and rear segments of a detector are considered to be the same detector for these purposes . note that double - count , same - detector events are not useful for polarization measurement . while these events are a significant fraction of those with @xmath15",
    ", we still observe a non - poissonian excess of counts at @xmath10=14 ; in addition , we can see non - poissonian excesses at @xmath10=8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 and 32 .",
    "these excesses indicate that the spacecraft timestamps are subject to systematic uncertainties at the @xmath16 level , and possibly even at the 32level .",
    "thus , we treat event pairs with @xmath17 as simultaneous in our subsequent analyses .    as a consequence of this definition ,",
    "if we observe more than two consecutive counts within 5  of each other , their simultaneity makes it impossible to extract a unique scattering event from the group .",
    "we therefore exclude all events within such multi - event groupings from our analysis .        to account for the highly variable nature of the grb light curve",
    ", we estimate the countrate in @xmath19s intervals , treating the count rate over each interval @xmath8 as constant for purposes of estimating the poissonian mean rate @xmath20 . for the entire selected portion of the grb light curve",
    ", we find the number @xmath21 of 5  bins containing @xmath9 counts to be @xmath22=969787 , @xmath23=72510 , @xmath24=5666 , and @xmath25=481 bins , respectively .    estimating the poisson mean rate @xmath26 in each interval from the number of single - event and zero - event time bins , we calculate the number of 5  time bins within that interval that will contain 2 ( @xmath27 ) or @xmath282 ( @xmath29 ) events , respectively , due to poisson fluctuations : @xmath30 summing over all @xmath31 intervals , we find @xmath32bins .",
    "the remaining excess of @xmath33 double - event bins are not due to coincidence ( event type b ) , and must be due to non - poisson processes ( event types a , c , or d ) .",
    "a disproportionate fraction of these arise from double - count events within a single detector ( event type c ) . of the @xmath34 events , 1313 are due to simultaneous events in the same detector , compared to the @xmath35 events expected from coincidence .    as a result ,",
    "when we require the two events in each double - event bin to rise from different detectors , we find an observed number of @xmath36 double - event , different - detector bins compared to an estimated number of @xmath37 due to poisson coincidence alone .",
    "this implies that @xmath38 double - event , different - detector bins may be due to scattering or unidentified detector effects ( event types a or d ) .      while we find the number of bins with @xmath39 events due to coincidence is @xmath29=1592 bins , we observe @xmath40=481  bins , for an excess of 32222 bins , which must be due to non - poisson processes ( event types a , c or d ) .",
    "if these non - poisson events were due exclusively to scattering processes , then the number of double - count events will be a fraction @xmath41 of single events @xmath42 , the number of triple scattering events @xmath43 , and number of @xmath9- scattering events @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath45 . taking @xmath46=(2.20.1 ) , we find @xmath47 , while we observe @xmath48 ( here , we have not corrected for double - count events due to scatters within a detector)2 between 1 mev and 150 kev . in a worse - case , the @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51  still discrepant with the observations . ] .",
    "thus , there are a factor 7.80.8 more @xmath40 events relative to the number of @xmath27 events than can be explained by scattering events .",
    "we compared the distribution of detectors and photon energy for counts included among the observed @xmath29 events , and found they do not differ significantly from the same distributions of all the grb data .",
    "specifically , the multi - count events typically occur in more than one detector .",
    "we performed an identical analysis on data from during a background period ( 43180 counts in 24 s ) , and found non - poissonian @xmath29 bins present in those data as well .",
    "the background period should have produced @xmath52 bins ( on average ) , but @xmath53=1013 .",
    "also during this period , @xmath54 , while @xmath55=3827 bins were observed .",
    "therefore , these non - poissonian excess events are not associated with the grb .",
    "we attribute this non - poissonian excess to an unknown process  perhaps particle background , or noise in the detector electronics or instrumentation  which we are unable to precisely model . nonetheless , based on the background period ,",
    "the non - poisson process produces a ratio of counts @xmath56 , significantly below the value of 5.90.5 observed during the burst .",
    "it seems reasonable that the same unknown process can also produce double - count events , contributing to the double - count event background ; however , the process is clearly non - poissonian , and we are unable to produce a demonstrably reliable estimate of the number of such events is constant between the background and the grb observation , then the number of double - count events during the grb which could be due to type a events is 190681 - 3.70.1@xmath57 ( 32222 ) = 715120 counts . ] .",
    "nonetheless , we note the effect and its uncertain contribution to the irreducible background as an event type d. [ sec : percent ]        1 .",
    "counts with time - tags different by @xmath58 5  should be regarded as simultaneous ; 2 .",
    "double - count events within a single detector contribute significantly , adding to the background of double - count events , but are easily identified in the data stream , and should be replaced with a single count at the earlier time - stamp ; 3 .",
    "an unknown effect produces multi - count groups ( @xmath59 ) of simultaneous counts in different detectors in excess of the number expected from coincidence , and which can not be attributed to a scattering process , both during the grb and during an earlier background period .",
    "these groups can be identified in the data - stream as occurring in a period @xmath585 ; since they can not be used for measuring polarization  as which two of the @xmath28 2 events were the sequentially first can not be determined  these events should be removed prior to analysis ; 4 .",
    "the same non - poissonian , non - scattering effect likely also produces double - count events ; we can estimate the number of double - count events based on the ratio @xmath60 ( correcting each value for the coincidence rate ) observed during the background observation .",
    "however since we can not model the non - poissonian process which is responsible for this ratio , the ratio has an unquantifiable systematic uncertainty .",
    "* replace all double - count events in the same detector with single - counts , at the earlier time stamp ( 83300 counts remaining afterwards ) .",
    "this removes `` echo '' counts in the detector @xcite . *",
    "remove groups of @xmath282 events which take place in @xmath585 , ( @xmath61719 such multi - count events , which is in excess of the @xmath29=474 such events expected from poisson statistics , leaving 81034 counts ) .",
    "following these selections , we have @xmath24=8230 double - count events remaining .",
    "this is fewer than the @xmath62 found by cb03 .",
    "we list the contributions of `` signal '' and the irreducible background to these totals in table  [ tab : bg ] .    to estimate the contribution to the irreducible background caused by coincidence of two unrelated photons in two different detectors , we use a similar approach as in   [ sec : coincidence ] .",
    "we use an integration time of @xmath630.005 sec , and find the number of single counts which have another which follows within @xmath64 . to do so , we calculate @xmath65 , the number of unbinned events which are a collection of @xmath66 counts within a period @xmath10 :      where @xmath68 is the number of detected counts in bin @xmath8 , and @xmath69 . using this",
    "we find @xmath27=664080 , after correcting by a factor 8/9 to account for the requirement that the counts be in two different detectors .",
    "this is greater than that found by cb03 ( @xmath70=448872 ) . if we were to assume a constant countrate throughout the burst we obtain @xmath71  lower than what we find for a variable intensity burst , but above that of cb03 .    to estimate the contribution to the irreducible background due to the `` unknown '' process",
    ", we performed the same analysis as in  [ sec : percent ] , but to the unbinned data , obtaining @xmath72=3.10.1 from the background period , giving us @xmath73 double - count events due to the unknown process ( this value has an unquantifiable systematic uncertainty ) .",
    "[ [ sec : simple ] ] a simpler method of determining the double - count event rate due to scattering between detectors ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    there is a method to estimate the fraction of double - count events which are due to scattering between detectors considerably more straightforward than attempting to identify all the backgrounds , as we do above .",
    "first , we note that for each detector the total solid angle subtended by secondary detectors varies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spex ] ) .",
    "in particular , the relative solid angle seen by the inner detectors ( numbers 1 , 2 , and 7 ) is significantly larger than that seen by the outer detectors ( numbers 36 , 8 , and 9 ) , and if scattering events represent a significant fraction of the total then this should be reflected in the number of double - count events involving each detector .    for the analysis in this sub - section only , we exclude detector 2 , due to its different electrical set - up .",
    "we calculate , for each detector , the total physical solid angle ( @xmath74 ) subtended by the other seven detectors , except where the lines of sight to the other detectors are blocked by detector 2 .",
    "we also examined the total number of single - counts in each detector @xmath75 observed during the grb  if all detectors were equally sensitive ( including shadowing by the spacecraft ) , they should have equal values of @xmath75 , but they do not , indicating different sensitivities during the grb .",
    "we use @xmath75 as a measure of the detector responses ( see table  [ tab : spex ] for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; note that we use the counts selected as described in ",
    "[ sec : dcounts ] ) .        where @xmath78 is held fixed at the observed number of counts for the double - events in detectors 1 and 3 - 9 ( 10906 ) . here , the coefficient on @xmath41 is due to the scattered events involving two detectors .",
    "the coefficient on @xmath79 is the random background .",
    "the value @xmath41 can be measured because the values of @xmath74 are different for different detectors .",
    "our analysis ignores two effects : the angular dependence of the klein - nishina cross section for scattering , and the absorption / scattering effects of passive material between detector units , which will decrease the effective @xmath74 by varying amounts , depending on the distance between detectors .    using a  minimization fitting technique ,",
    "we obtain an acceptable fit to the data ( = 9.28 for 7 degrees of freedom  dof ) , for @xmath800.03 . the best fit and residuals , including the proportion of double events associated with scattering and coincidence , respectively , for each detector , are shown in figure  [ fig : derekfit ] . therefore , we find 113% of the double - count events are due to scattering between detectors .",
    "comparing this with the value we found by attempting to eliminate all the reducible background sources we find ( 113%@xmath57823090 double - count events)=910250 double - count events due to scattering between detectors ( where here use double - count events in all detectors , including detector 2 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the value of 830130 double - count events we found from the detailed analysis of the different background contributions .",
    "[ fig : ddsolid]a presents the number of single counts @xmath81 as a function of detector angle @xmath11 , where for each event @xmath11 indicates the position of the detector at the time of the event , relative to the center of the detector array in a non - rotating celestial frame ( @xmath82 is celestial north ) .",
    "we see that there is a clear bias for single events to occur towards one side of the spacecraft",
    ". this could be due to a number of effects .",
    "for example , different detector sensitivities produce uneven exposure as a function of time over the range of @xmath11 which , combined with the grb intensity variability ( fig .  [ fig : lc ] ) , can produce such a bias . also , earth - scattered gamma - rays  which may constitute a significant fraction of the total events  will preferentially illuminate the side of the spacecraft towards the earth ( see for discussion )",
    ".    the increased rate of single events towards one side of the spacecraft will produce an increased rate of double events on the same side through the increased coincidence rate ( it will also produce an increased rate of double events through scattering ) .",
    "[ fig : ddsolid]b presents the distribution @xmath83 for the double events , where 2 values of @xmath11 are used ( one for each detector involved in the double ) .",
    "@xmath83 shows the same bias as the @xmath84 distribution .",
    "indeed , the @xmath11 angular variations in the single and double count rates are highly correlated .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ddsolid]c , which shows that although the @xmath85 values for a constant fit to the variations of @xmath84 and @xmath83 separately are both very high ( giving @xmath86 in both cases ) , the @xmath85 value for their ratio , @xmath87 , is close to unity , and acceptable for a constant fit ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "if the double count events were due entirely to coincidences of independent single - count events we would expect that @xmath89 .",
    "however , if a significant fraction of double - count events are due to scattering , and polarization of gamma - ray photons produces scatters toward a preferred direction in @xmath11 and @xmath90 , as suggested by the results of cb03 , then we should observe a @xmath83 that was significantly different than @xmath84 .",
    "our result here conflicts with this , suggesting instead that the variability observed by cb03 is not due to polarization - effected scattering , but due to systematic uncertainty in the calculation of their `` null '' lightcurve by mc simulation .    as a result ,",
    "the coincidence rate for any given pair of detectors will increase when they are both on the preferred side of the spacecraft , and this may allow the derived `` scatter angles '' for the coincidence events to pick out a preferred direction on the sky . in the next section we describe and perform a polarization analysis which is insensitive to contamination from angular structure in the coincidence events , which is clearly the dominant effect in the observed double - count event variability .            where @xmath92 is the time dependent flux ( ) and @xmath93 is the detector response ( counts erg@xmath94 ) , which we allow to be time - dependent due to the rotation of _ rhessi _  with respect to the sky .",
    "we assume that the probability that a count : ( 1 ) is a single - scattering event in detector @xmath8 ; ( 2 ) escapes detector @xmath8 ; and ( 3 ) is then partially or fully absorbed in a second detector @xmath9 , is a time - independent factor @xmath95 , dependent only on the materials and geometry of the _ rhessi _  spectrometer .    the number of double - count events due to unpolarized photons between detectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 at a time @xmath96 when the centers of those two detectors produce a line which has a position angle @xmath97 on the sky ( relative to the north celestial pole ) can be found :      if the beam is polarized , this produces a polarization pattern @xmath99 where @xmath100 is now the angle the detectors make on the sky as a function of time , and @xmath101 is the rotational frequency of the _ rhessi _   detector plane , and @xmath102 is the angle the detector pair @xmath103 makes on the sky at time @xmath104.20% of our 15  bins , and will not affect or conclusions . ]                    if @xmath113 ( unpolarized photons ) then @xmath114 is a constant , with no dependence on @xmath11 .",
    "however , if @xmath115 , then the observed function @xmath114 will have an angular dependence , as @xmath116 .",
    "the only contribution to the uncertainty in @xmath114 is photon counting statistics .",
    "more specifically , @xmath114 is independent of the mass model of the spacecraft , and the uncertainty of detection of polarization using @xmath114 does not depend on systematic uncertainties in the space - craft mass model as it does in cb03 .",
    "however , it should be noted that correcting a detected signal to find the intrinsic polarization magnitude ( that is , turning the detection into a quantitative measurement ) would still require using the mass - model .      here , we note an additional correction . as discussed in ",

    "even so , the uncertainty is dominated by the smaller number of double - event counts , which are in the range 610 - 770 in each bin .",
    "the grb was offset from the pointing axis , which is perpendicular to the plane of detectors , by 17.98 . assuming a thin detector plane , photons which first scatter in a detector on the side of the detector plane toward the grb can scatter through an angle ( to the second detector ) of up to @xmath141=90 + 18=108 ; while photons which first scatter on the side of the detector plane away from the grb could scatter through an angle of up to @xmath14290 - 18=72 .",
    "the difference in scattering geometry produces a varying scattering cross section for gamma - rays in the 0.15 - 2.0 mev energy range , dependent on @xmath11  the angle between a line connecting the centers of the two detectors and the projection of the direction of the grb from the optical axis in the detector plane  through the klein - nishina cross section :      this will produce directionally preferential scattering from a non - polarized beam of gamma - rays in the detectors . if the direction of the grb is @xmath144 ( where @xmath145 is 18 ) the line which joins two detectors as @xmath146 , then @xmath147 and @xmath148 .    in fig .",

    "it is notable that the kn cross - section produces an effect on the observed signal which is nearly identical to that expected from an intrinsically polarized beam .    the magnitude of `` apparent polarization '' ( that is , the value of @xmath156 which parameterizes @xmath154 using @xmath116 ; see fig .

    "we calculated the fractional magnitude and direction of the kn effect on the double - count scattering events , by averaging the magnitude of the effect at the energy of each detected count during the grb ( neglecting the 10% of counts due to background ) and finding the average and standard deviation , which were @xmath1580.0490.003 .",
    "we can represent the effect of the kn cross section on the intensity pattern produced by the grb by :        in the present data , the magnitude of @xmath162 will be decreased by a factor @xmath163 ( 90% confidence ) .",

    "a similar limit on @xmath162 is obtained holding fixed  @xmath168 , ( @xmath169 ) , which is consistent with our calculated upper - limit for this effect .",
    "we attempt to duplicate the results of cb03 .",
    "in particular , we are interested in duplicating their observed double - event lightcurve . while the methods of producing the double - event lightcurve of cb03 have not been described as of this writing , there are only a few variables which were not specified by cb03 : ( 1 ) @xmath10 ; ( 2 ) whether or not multiple - scattering events ( `` bunches '' ) are retained ; and ( 3 ) the zero point for @xmath11 .",

    "the residual counts lightcurve is the difference between the raw counts and their mc estimation for the double - event count rate ( @xmath170=@xmath2 ) , assuming zero intrinsic polarization , and using the geant mass model for radiative transfer through _ rhessi _  that of all photons which are detected as double - count events , 194% have not been scattered previously in spacecraft passive material , and thus have the polarization intact during measurement . ] .",
    "we note that the average values of  and  found by cb03 coincide within @xmath1710.1% .",
    "we obtain a good duplication of the cb03 double - event count curves , using @xmath172=8  ( as compared with @xmath10=5  in our previous analysis ) ; retaining all multi - count events ( `` bunches '' , including triples and higher ) ; and setting @xmath82 to coincide with 12.6  e of n in the ecliptic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cb03]b , top panel ) . here",
    ", we find @xmath27=15540 counts , which is close to the @xmath27=14916 found by cb03 .",

    "[ eq : r ] & [ eq : r2 ] ) . instead ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cb03]c ) , we see that @xmath114 is scattered , significantly different from a constant ( = 2.49/11 dof ; prob.=0.4% ) , but with no systematic trend approximating a sinusoidal modulation . the scatter in @xmath114 can not be due to a constant polarization signal as implied by cb03 ( as we presently show , the scatter is due to the `` bunches '' ) .",
    "we conclude from this that the signal observed by cb03 is not due to polarization in grb  021206 .",
    "we then dropped from the analysis all the `` bunches '' of counts ( multiplicities of 3 and greater ) .",
    "we do this , because we see no reason that polarized photons should be preferentially detected in events which involve @xmath1742 scatters .",
    "moreover , as we have shown above , the bunches do not follow a poisson distribution , and do not follow a simplistic distribution expected from scattering ; we therefore interpret these `` bunches '' as a background signal .",
    "there were a total of 1272 such bunches , producing a total of 4592 double - count counts ; after removal , there were 10948 double - count events remaining .",
    "we performed the analysis again :  and  in fig .",
    "[ fig : cb03]d , top panel ; with residual counts @xmath2 in the bottom panel . while the modulation of the residual counts is reduced , there remains a significant deviation ( in the range @xmath11=100 - 180 ) .",
    "however , the corresponding @xmath114 ( fig .  [ fig : cb03]e ) is consistent with a constant value ( = 0.66 , 11 dof , prob.=77% ) . applying the identical analysis as above , we again obtain a limit of @xmath175 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "this means that polarization is not detected ( and that the scatter in @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cb03]c is due to the presence of the `` bunches '' of counts ) .",
    "when we duplicate the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : simple ] on the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : cb03]b and c , we obtain a fraction of counts which may be due to double - count scattering events of @xmath41=92% ( = 6.0 , 6 dof ; prob.=3 ) and 83% ( = 13.9 , 6 dof ; prob.=0.03 ) , respectively .",
    "the fact that data which includes the `` bunches '' is not well - modeled by our scattering model is consistent with the conclusion that these events are not related to scattering .",
    "to what can the modulation reported in cb03 be due ?",
    "since the lack of modulation in @xmath114 implies that @xmath176 , yet @xmath177 is not constant in @xmath11 , the modulation must be in , and not in .",
    "we attribute , therefore , the modulation observed by cb03 to neglected systematic uncertainty in , which we explore in   [ sec : systematic ] .          where @xmath178 is the intrinsic fractional polarization of grb  021206 ; @xmath180 is the fraction of _ rhessi_-detected double - count photons which have not been previously scattered within the detector ; @xmath81 is the number of double - count events due to scattering , and @xmath181 is the number of background double - count events ( that is , not due to scattering ) .",
    "if our parameter @xmath156 is consistent with zero , then the intrinsic polarization @xmath178 is also consistent with zero ; thus , regardless of the magnitude of ( and uncertainties in ) @xmath180 , @xmath81 and @xmath181 , our upper - limit of @xmath175 implies a non - detection of polarization in the _ rhessi _  data of grb  021206 .",
    "this is in conflict with the claim of detection described by cb03 .",
    "cb03 finds @xmath185 from their monte carlo mass - model simulations , which we adopt . relying upon this value , @xmath186 ( fractional polarization , or @xmath171214% )  that is , an upper - limit which permits up to 100% intrinsic polarization for grb  021206 , implying that the observation is not sensitive to intrinsic polarization in grb  021206 .",
    "if we had found the fraction @xmath41 of total double - count events from scattering to be that found by cb03 ( @xmath187661% ; see table  [ tab : bg ] ) , we would would instead conclude that @xmath188 ( 90% confidence ) , compared with the @xmath189 ( cb03 ) .",
    "however , our analysis (  [ sec : dcounts ] ) finds that @xmath41=113% , which produces instead a limit on the intrinsic polarization of grb  021206well above 100% .",
    "our conclusion is that the _ rhessi _  dataset is not capable of detecting polarization in grb  021206 , due to the low signal - to - noise of the dataset ( that is , a relatively small number of double - count scattering events compared to that estimated by cb03 ) .      in our analysis ,",
    "the uncertainty in polarization _",
    "detection _ is due only to poisson noise ( in @xmath114 ) ; in the analysis of cb03 , the uncertainty in polarization _ detection _ ( @xmath190 ) is the sum of poisson noise and the systematic uncertainty in @xmath191 .",
    "cb03 neglect the systematic uncertainty in @xmath191 . here , we show that this systematic uncertainty is not negligible .",

    "@xmath19520 counts , or 1.6% per angular bin , given the @xmath196 counts / bin .",
    "we can estimate the uncertainty in @xmath194 in the analysis of cb03 from the uncertainty in its mean value ( @xmath197 ) , which has a 25% uncertainty . if we take the uncertainty in @xmath191 to be the same fractional value as the uncertainty in the average @xmath180 ( 25% per angular bin ) , we find approximately @xmath198310 counts / bin , much larger than the 20 counts limit , and which should appear directly in their difference lightcurve ( their fig.2 , or our fig .

    "however , their analysis shows only the poisson uncertainty ( @xmath20040 counts ) .",
    "moreover , the neglected @xmath201 counts / bin is greater than the reported modulation magnitude ( @xmath5120 counts / bin ) ; thus , we see no reason to neglect it .",
    "we conclude that the analysis for detection of polarization by cb03 incorrectly neglected the dominant uncertainty  the systematic uncertainty @xmath191 , which must be added in quadrature with the poisson uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty , from the above approximate analysis , is greater than the reported signal interpreted as due to polarization .      in selecting data to analyze",
    ", we found 8230 double - count events ( including signal and irreducible background ) .",
    "this is well below the 14916 double - count events found by cb03 ( table  [ tab : bg ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy appears to be due to two selections employed by cb03 : ( 1 ) an unjustifiably wide time window for `` simultaneous '' events ( @xmath202 , whereas we see only @xmath203 as being justified ) and ( 2 ) the inclusion of multi - count events ( `` bunches '' ) , in which @xmath282 counts are detected within @xmath10 .",
    "we described an analysis to detect polarization in _ rhessi _  data .",
    "we apply this analysis to the data for grb  021206 , and find no evidence for a signal which might be interpreted as due to polarization .",
    "the magnitude of polarization - like modulation in the lightcurve is @xmath2040.041 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "this corresponds to an upper - limit on the intrinsic polarization of grb  021206  of @xmath205214% ; that is , we find that the analysis is insensitive to polarization at any level in grb  021206 .",
    "the discrepancy between our derived upper - limit and the claimed detection by cb03 is due to two effects .",
    "first , during _ detection _ , cb03 neglected the systematic uncertainty in their null lightcurve , due to the monte carlo simulation of radiative transfer through the _ rhessi _  mass model ; the magnitude of this uncertainty is consistent with the magnitude of the observed modulation . in comparison , this systematic uncertainty does not play a role in the present @xmath114 analysis , since the mass model is unnecessary .",
    "we are instead limited by poisson noise .",
    "thus , we conclude that the modulation interpreted as due to polarization by cb03 is instead due to systematic uncertainty in their null lightcurve .",
    "second , during _ correction _ of the detection of polarization signals into the magnitude of intrinsic polarization in grb  021206  we find 113% of all detected double - count events in our selection are due to scattering events .",
    "this results in a low signal - to - noise ratio , and a resulting high upper - limit on @xmath178 , such that the observation does not constrain the intrinsic polarization of grb  021206 .",
    "we justified our data selections and demonstrate that the signal should be clean of irreducible background .",
    "in contrast , cb03 estimated that 661% of their detected double - count events were due to scattering events , while not describing or justifying their selection criteria .",
    "specifically , our duplication of the analysis of cb03 found an unjustifiably larger `` simultaneous '' window ( @xmath10=8 , vs. @xmath10=5  we used ) and included the multi - count events ( `` bunches '' )  both of which increase the background .    in our analysis ,",
    "the limiting sensitivity is the highest theoretically possible  set by photon counting statistics .",
    "we therefore believe our analysis is more robust , and we conclude that : ( 1 ) the _ rhessi_observation of grb  021206  is not sensitive to polarization , and ( 2 ) there is otherwise no evidence for polarization in the data .    in conclusion , we find that there is no existing constraint on the intrinsic polarization in the gamma - ray flux of grb  021206   or , for that matter , any gamma - ray burst .",
    "it seems unlikely that a constraint will emerge from further _ rhessi",
    "_  observations .",
    "grb  021206  was extremely bright ( brighter than any grb observed during 8 years of full - sky coverage with ulysses ; ) and detector deadtime already played a role in decreasing the signal - to - noise ratio at the peak of the burst , meaning an even brighter burst will only moderately improve the signal - to - noise ratio ; also , grb  021206  was located within 5% of the sky closest to the solar limb , as it must to take advantage of the polarization detection approach used herein ( distinctly different from that used to measure polarization in solar flares ) , further decreasing the likelihood of a useful constraint on grb polarization with _",
    "rhessi_. such a measurement must therefore wait for more sensitive instrumentation .",

    "<S> rather , the cb03 signal is consistent with the previously - neglected systematic uncertainty in the `` null lightcurve '' used for detection . </S>",
    "<S> due to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the _ rhessi _  data , our poisson noise - limited analysis results in an upper limit consistent with 100%-polarization of the gamma - ray flux from grb  021206 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no observational constraint on the polarization of grb  021206  can be derived from these data .    </S>",
