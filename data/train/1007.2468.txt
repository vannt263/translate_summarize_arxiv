    "as suggested by @xcite and confirmed by @xcite , there is a correlation between the distances and redshifts of galaxies that arises from the expansion of our universe : galaxies at greater apparent distance show more redshifted spectral features . the exact relationship between distance and redshift changes for different cosmological theories or different cosmological parameters .",
    "accurate measurements of the distance - redshift relation may therefore help to discriminate between models and to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "distance estimates based on the apparent magnitudes of type - ia supernova ( sn ) have provided constraints for the current expansion rate and the mean matter density of our universe , and substantiated the evidence for the currently favoured @xmath9cdm model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since sn observations indicated a cosmological constant or another dark - energy component is currently accelerating the cosmic expansion @xcite . in conjunction with other cosmological probes , current sn data",
    "even puts constraints on the properties of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "while type - ia sn can only be seen out to redshifts @xmath10 , gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) can be detected at much higher redshifts .",
    "there is growing evidence for correlations between observed and intrinsic burst properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with which grbs can provide distance estimates out to redshifts @xmath11 @xcite . when added to distance data at lower redshift , the higher - redshift bursts help to break parameter degeneracies in cosmological models and make grbs a valuable discriminant between dark - energy models @xcite .",
    "another promising way to obtain very accurate distance measurements in the future are observations of gravitational waves emitted by merging supermassive black hole binaries ( msbs ) @xcite . from the gravitational wave phasing , it is possible to determine the luminosity distance to the source and the redshifted mass , @xmath12 , to high precision .",
    "however , the redshift can not be measured from the gravitational waves alone , so the use of msbs as distance probes will rely on the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart to measure the redshift of the merger event @xcite .",
    "detection of the gravitational - wave signals from msbs is one of the main goals of the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "msbs are very luminous and can be observed out to the cosmic horizon .",
    "current estimates suggest that lisa will see a few tens of events per year , of which most will have distance measurements to less than @xmath13 , and of the order of two per year will have distance measurements to less than @xmath14 and sky localisation to within a square degree @xcite .",
    "the distance measurements for standard candles like type - ia sne , grbs , and standard sirens like msbs are based on the comparison of the electromagnetic or gravitational radiation energy emitted by the source ( assumed to be known at least statistically ) and the radiation flux or amplitude received by the observer s detector .",
    "apart from the emitted signal strength and the distance between source and observer ( and other factors ) , the received signal strength is also affected by gravitational lensing : gravitational deflection by intervening matter structures may focus or defocus the radiation towards the observer , resulting in an increased or decreased detector signal .",
    "this gravitational magnification induces an additional scatter in the distance estimates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "evidence for gravitational magnification has been found in the goods sn data @xcite and the supernova legacy survey @xcite .",
    "the lensing effect is small compared to other sources of uncertainty for current sn samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it will become significant for large future high - redshift ( i.e. with @xmath15 ) sn samples @xcite . in particular , pencil - beam surveys might be compromised by gravitational lensing because of the large spatial correlation of the magnification @xcite .",
    "there is also strong evidence that high - redshift grbs are significantly affected by gravitational lensing and magnification bias ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may lead to large biases in their deduced distances if not properly accounted for . moreover , magnification scatter will almost certainly be the dominant source of error in distance measurements using msbs @xcite .    while a source of noise for distance measurements , magnification of standard candles / sirens has also been considered a useful signal of the cosmic matter distribution .",
    "the observed scatter in sne brightnesses can be used to constrain the amount of dark matter in the form of massive compact objects @xcite , or to measure the power spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales @xcite and on larger scales @xcite .",
    "correlations between galaxies and sn brigtnesses can be used to constrain the properties of galaxy halos @xcite .    when measuring distances to standard candles / sirens , one can try to correct for the gravitational lensing effects by inferring the magnification from other observations .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite suggested modelling the matter distribution between the observer and a source using a model for the halos of the observed galaxies near the line of sight .",
    "these foreground models could reduce magnification scatter for high - redshift sn by up to a factor of 3 .",
    "however , the success of this technique relies heavily on the validity of many assumptions about the detailed relation between observed light and total matter .",
    "@xcite used convergence power spectra to estimate the correlation between the true convergence ( which is closely linked to the magnification ) and the convergence as reconstructed from background galaxy shear measurements .",
    "they found that even with a very high number density of galaxies for the convergence reconstruction , the reduction in the magnification - induced scatter was small . based on similar calculations",
    ", @xcite estimated that convergence maps reconstructed using galaxy flexion in addition to shear might help to reduce the lensing - induced distance errors by up to 50% , making this particular ` delensing ' approach promising .    in this work ,",
    "we use ray - tracing through the millennium simulation @xcite to investigate how accurately the lensing magnification of standard candles and standard sirens in a @xmath9cdm universe can be inferred from the shear and flexion measured in the images of distant galaxies .",
    "the accuracy with which the magnification can be estimated directly determines the lensing - induced uncertainty in the distances of type - ia sne , grbs , and msbs that remains after delensing , i.e. after a correction for the magnification effects has been applied . in a companion paper",
    ", we will discuss the consequences of delensing for the use of gravitational - wave sources as cosmological probes in comparison to other probes .",
    "compared to the magnification correction scheme suggested , e.g. , by @xcite , the method discussed here has the advantage that it does not require any assumptions about the relation between the distribution of visible and dark matter .",
    "this method consists of ( i ) reconstructing the convergence toward a sn , grb , or msb as accurately as possible from the shear and flexion measurements of galaxy images near the line - of - sight , ( ii ) estimating the magnification from the reconstructed convergence , and ( iii ) correcting the observed sn , grb , or msb signal using the inferred magnification .    as will be shown below , for the correction to yield satisfactory results",
    ", one must reconstruct the convergence on sub - arc - minute scales ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the non - gaussian nature of the underlying density field becomes important .",
    "moreover , a realistic description of the noise of the convergence reconstruction on these scales has to take into account the discreteness and randomness of the galaxy image positions . finally , the relation between the magnification and the noisy reconstructed convergence is non - trivial .",
    "such complications usually have to be neglected in a treatment relying on convergence correlations and gaussian statistics ( as was done , e.g , by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , all these effects can be included in the ray - tracing simulations used here .",
    "this approach not only provides more realistic predictions about the performance of magnification correction schemes , but also an optimised magnification estimate , and more detailed information about the residual magnification after correction .",
    "in particular , the simulations yield detailed probability distributions for the magnification and its residual as a function of the reconstructed convergence .",
    "such information is valuable as input for bayesian parameter estimation for cosmological models , and helps to further reduce lensing - induced errors and biases on cosmological parameters @xcite .",

    "there are several complications in practice .",
    "first , neither the shear @xmath61 , nor the flexion @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be directly measured , but only their reduced versions @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this complication can be taken into account , e.g. , by iterative reconstruction methods @xcite . moreover , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 for most parts of the sky .",
    "it is thus assumed in the following that galaxy shapes provide estimates for the shear and flexion ( and we postpone the proper treatment of reduced shear and flexion to forthcoming studies ) .",
    "even from a perfect shear or flexion map , the convergence can only be reconstructed up to a constant because of the mass - sheet degeneracy @xcite .",
    "in addition , the boundary conditions influence the reconstruction near the edges of finite fields .",
    "these problems can , however , be alleviated by using a large field of view for the reconstruction ( whose mean convergence is close enough to zero , as discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and special finite - field inversion techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the galaxies that can be used to measure the shear and flexion have a finite number density @xmath70 and thus only provide shear and flexion estimates at a finite number of discrete and randomly distributed points .",
    "moreover , the shape of a galaxy image provides a very noisy estimate for the shear and flexion .",
    "therefore , spatial interpolation and averaging are necessary to obtain a convergence estimate with acceptable signal - to - noise in the desired direction of a standard candle / siren . the smoothing erases real structure on small scales , which causes additional deviations of the reconstructed convergence from the ` true ' convergence .",
    "the optimal smoothing scale is determined by a trade - off between the aim to reconstruct as much small - scale structure of the convergence as possible and to average over as many galaxy images as possible , so as to reduce the noise due to the dispersion in their intrinsic shapes @xcite .    finally",
    ", the galaxies do not all lie at the redshift @xmath29 of the standard candle / siren , but have a certain redshift distribution @xmath71 depending on their intrinsic redshift distribution and on the depth of the survey .",

    "furthermore , we have studied the optimal smoothing scale for the weak - lensing reconstruction under various survey conditions .    for an advanced shear survey with @xmath101 , we find that the lensing - induced distance errors for standard candles / sirens at redshifts @xmath2 are reduced on average by @xmath4 .",
    "this confirms earlier findings by @xcite that reconstructions based on such surveys do not significantly reduce the lensing errors on average .",
    "however , in regions with low estimated convergence @xmath134 , the residual magnification uncertainty is substantially smaller than in regions of high convergence ( e.g. only @xmath247 of the uncorrected error for @xmath177 compared to @xmath248 for @xmath249 ) .",
    "thus a weak - lensing survey is useful to identify standard candles / sirens in regions with low ( high ) convergence and small ( large ) magnification errors , which can then be given larger ( smaller ) weights in a statistical analysis .    as already pointed out by @xcite , the correction from weak - lensing reconstruction",
    "can be improved considerably by including flexion measurements and greatly increasing the galaxy number density .",

    "the light distribution contains valuable information about the matter distribution and the magnification .",
    "a better magnification correction might be obtained by inferring the foreground matter distribution from both the observed properties of galaxies along the line of sight and the shear and flexion information from distant galaxies .",
    "additional information about the matter distribution at redshifts beyond those probed by conventional galaxy weak lensing and flexion could be gathered from observations of lensing of the cosmic microwave background @xcite or high - redshift 21-cm radiation @xcite .    in our simulations , we have fully taken into account many aspects of weak - lensing galaxy surveys that impact the accuracy of the correction .",

    "<S> such strongly reduced magnification uncertainties will greatly improve the value of high - redshift standard candles / sirens as cosmological probes .    </S>",
