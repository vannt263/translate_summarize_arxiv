    "a closer view on proposition 3 shows that the most general allowed diagram in the many - particle problem is of the form @xmath49=[l,2^{m-1},1^{k - m}]$ ] with the associated tableau :    @xmath97    the width @xmath98 of the first row is restricted to the values @xmath99 and @xmath100 , whereas the allowed @xmath101 and @xmath102 values depend on @xmath103 ( the numbers of @xmath31 and @xmath32 electrons ) .",

    "this means that there are states of different symmetries and spin values with the same energy .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by the term @xmath123 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "because the dimension of @xmath71 is one , the state @xmath69 is an eigenstate of @xmath76 . in the case",
    "a ( @xmath124 ) , it is convenient to use @xmath79 instead of @xmath70 and to change the order convention of proposition 3 into @xmath125 . we then obtain the eigenstates a : @xmath126 where @xmath127 creates a singlet pair on the sites @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath128 is the sublattice formed by the @xmath98 sites in the first row of @xmath51 . this is only one particular eigenstate of this level .",
    "in fact , as already stated in reference @xcite , a general eigenstate of level a with total spin @xmath42 is of the form : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is an arbitrary wavefunction of @xmath131 electrons with spin @xmath42 , @xmath132 creates an electron in the single - particle groundstate and @xmath13 projects out states with doubly occupied sites .",
    "an eigenstate of level b is given by @xmath133 @xmath134 being the set of permutations of @xmath135 ( the first column ) and @xmath136 the permutations of @xmath137 ( second column ) .",
    "again this is only one representative member of a large subspace of degenerate eigenstates .",
    "the others can in principle be calculated through the repeated application of permutation operators , the spin - lowering operator @xmath138 and linear combinations of them .",
    "whether there is a more compact characterization of these subspaces like in the case a is an open question .",
    "the diagrams with @xmath140 appear with multiplicity @xmath141 if @xmath142 and with multiplicity @xmath143 if @xmath144 .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath76 in @xmath71 leads therefore to two levels with total spin @xmath145 .",
    "@xmath71 is spanned by the two symmetrized wavefunctions : @xmath146    the odd combination of them @xmath147 with @xmath148 is easily seen to be an eigenstate of @xmath77 with @xmath149 because it is annulled by the raising operator @xmath150 .",
    "hence it has to be an eigenstate of @xmath76 as well .",

    "the second eigenvector with @xmath152 must be orthogonal to @xmath153 and therefore is given by the sum @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "these states correspond to the part d of the spectrum and the energies are @xmath156 .      for @xmath110 figures 1 and 2 remain valid exept that level b contains now only the ferromagnetic states with @xmath120 . to see this",
    ", we notice that the symmetrized states of level b correspond to a young diagram with @xmath115 .",
    "if only one hole is present , this means that @xmath157 and thus the only remaining diagram is @xmath158 $ ] .",
    "this diagram corresponds to the ferromagnetic state @xmath159 the only degeneracy is in this case the trivial spin degeneracy @xmath160 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath110 and a positive hopping parameter @xmath161 the ground state is ferromagnetic .",
    "this result is not surprising since it is a consequence of two well known theorems , both confirming a unique ferromagnetic ground state for this particular case .",
    "the first is tasaki s extension of nagaoka s theorem @xcite and the second is a theorem proven by mielke on flat band ferromagnetism @xcite .    in this model , we find an example of nagaoka ferromagnetism where the one - hole - condition is absolutely necessary , for we find always a complete spin degeneracy for @xmath162 .",
    "at this point it is worthwile to connect the present approach with that of kirson @xcite , who exploited the dynamical supersymmetry of the model .",
    "his classification of many - electron states in fock space @xmath163 is based on the irreducible representations @xmath164 $ ] of a certain superalgebra .",
    "the representation space of @xmath164 $ ] contains four possible pairs of quantum numbers , namely @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and @xmath42 is the total spin .",
    "we can identify the representation space of @xmath164 $ ] with @xmath170 , where @xmath49=[l,2^{m-1},1^{k - m}]$ ] is related to @xmath171 and @xmath42 by @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .    for a given @xmath44",
    "there are ( in general ) four classes of symmetrized states in fock space .",
    "these correspond to parts a to d of the spectrum with differing numbers of particles ( @xmath23 and @xmath175 ) , and can be identified with the four pairs of quantum numbers in @xmath164 $ ] : @xmath176",
    "the method developed in the previous sections can be generalized for other models which are invariant under permutations of the lattice sites .",
    "for instance the hubbard model with infinite range hopping , @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 can in principle be treated in the same way .",
    "the most important new feature is the appearance of doubly occupied sites .",
    "proposition 3 has to be modified in a way as to treat these sites as well .",
    "the procedure is the following :    1 .",
    "compute the admissible tableaux ( the basis states of @xmath71 ) without double occupation as explained in section [ method ] or in appendix a. 2 .",
    "replace a pair @xmath180 of symbols by @xmath181 and compute the symmetrized states with exactly one double occupation .",
    "the new symbol @xmath182 has to be included in the ordering convention , e.g. @xmath183 .",
    "3 .   replace another two symbols @xmath180 by @xmath181 and continue , until there is no pair @xmath180 left . in proposition 3 ,",
    "the symbols @xmath182 are treated like the holes , i.e. they must not be repeated within the same column .    a model which includes doubly occupied sites is much more difficult to solve than the model considered in this paper .",
    "nevertheless there is a particular class of diagrams where these complications do not matter .",
    "consider a diagram of the form ( [ klm ] ) where the number @xmath98 of boxes in the first row equals @xmath184 . in the tableaux of this kind",
    ", there is no way to produce a doubly occupied state without violating the rules , because there is no room for an additional hole .",
    "the only symmetrized states according to such a diagram are therefore the states b , eigenstates of @xmath76 , which contain no double occupation .",
    "we conclude that every eigenstate of @xmath76 belonging to case b is at the same time an eigenstate of the hubbard hamiltonian with the unchanged energy @xmath122 .    since in the case @xmath4 and @xmath26 we find @xmath185 and @xmath186 for every state @xmath187 , the states b are even the ( only ) ground states of @xmath188 .",
    "it is remarkable that the term @xmath123 splits the accidental degeneracy of level b , while this degeneracy remains exact in the hubbard model for every positive value of @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that the @xmath0 model does not capture correctly the behaviour of the hubbard model , even not in the asymptotic region @xmath189 .",
    "( in fact , a systematic large @xmath3 expansion of the hubbard model yields , in addition to the exchange term , another contribution , the so - called pair - hopping term . see e.g. @xcite . )",
    "we have shown that the permutation symmetry of the @xmath0 model with infinite range hopping allows to derive explicitly the energy spectrum , the eigenfunctions and their quantum numbers .",
    "the model is admittedly rather unphysical due to the complete lattice connectivity which leads to unusually high level degeneracies .",
    "nevertheless the many - body spectrum has a very rich structure , and therefore the model deserves to be added to the few nontrivial cases of exactly solvable strongly correlated fermion systems .",
    "our results for the spectrum and the degeneracies agree with those derived on the basis of a dynamical supersymmetry @xcite , but in addition we have also been able to obtain all the eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , we have found an exact correspondence between the two approaches .",
    "we are indebted to duncan haldane for initiating this study several years ago .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 model with constant @xmath1 and @xmath2 between any pair of sites is studied by exploiting the symmetry of the hamiltonian with respect to site permutations . for a given number of electrons and a given total spin the exchange term simply yields an additive constant . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the real problem is to diagonalize the `` @xmath1 model '' , or equivalently the infinite @xmath3 hubbard hamiltonian . using extensively the properties of the permutation group , we are able to find explicitly both the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates , labeled according to spin quantum numbers and young diagrams . as a corollary we also obtain the degenerate ground states of the finite @xmath3 hubbard model with infinite range hopping @xmath4 . </S>"
