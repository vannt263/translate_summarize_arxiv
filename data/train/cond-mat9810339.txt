    "the ability to fabricate small samples , thanks to the progress of the technology developped for the microelectronic industry , has opened a new field of research for the physics community .",
    "this field of research has been called mesoscopic physics since although the size of these systems is far bigger than the atomic scale , quantum mechanics is needed in order to understand their behavior .",
    "a new length scale has then been introduced , intermediate between the atomic scale and the macroscopic scale , namely the phase - breaking length @xmath2 @xcite . in pure metals at low temperature",
    ", @xmath2 can reach several micrometers @xcite .",
    "the best known examples of mesoscopic physics are the universal conductance fluctuations and the weak localization .",
    "the first effect arises from the interference of the one - electron wave - function using all the possible paths to travel through the sample .",
    "this interference gives rise to magnetoconductance fluctuations , whose amplitude @xmath3 has the remarkable property to be universal , i.e. independent of the sample conductance . in a loop geometry , this interference gives rise to the well known aharonov - bohm oscillations with a flux - periodicity @xmath4 @xcite .    in cylinder or arrays geometries with a total length exceeding @xmath2 , aharonov - bohm oscillations and universal conductance fluctuations average to zero .",
    "but at low magnetic field , a special class of event survives to ensemble averaging .",
    "when one considers a given path and its time reversed dual , the wave - functions along the two paths interfer constructively if time reversal symmetry is conserved @xcite . in that special case , interferences increase the probability to return to the origin of a loop , and one observes a decrease of the conductance . for the loop geometry ,",
    "the flux periodicity is @xmath5 since the loop is travelled twice by the electron @xcite .",
    "both conductance fluctuations and weak localization are mesoscopic effects in the sense that they appear on the length scale of the phase - breaking length @xmath6 .",
    "their amplitude corresponds to the conductance ( @xmath7 ) of one transport channel , even if many channels are involved .",
    "this comes from the fact that the different channels do not have a common phase reference .",
    "in the usual case of a sample made of an evaporated thin metallic film , the amplitudes of conductance fluctuations and weak localization are small compared to the total conductance .",
    "the mesoscopic effects are not intrinsically limited to a small amplitude .",
    "the most beautiful example is the `` mesoscopic superconductivity '' arising in a normal metal n from the andreev reflection of electrons at a superconductor s. the superconductivity in s results in a macroscopic phase - coherent pair condensate . in these n - s systems , the coupling of normal electrons to the pair condensate induces coherence effects which add constructively and reach a total large amplitude .    in this review paper",
    ", we will discuss the transport properties of devices made of a normal metal in metallic contact with a superconductor .",
    "this scientific area has met a remarkable new interest in the recent years , due to novel experiments on samples with new mesoscopic designs @xcite . here , we will restrict to the case of transport in diffusive metals in the presence of andreev reflection . the josephson effect @xcite",
    "will not be discussed as we will concentrate on non - equilibrium properties .",
    "we will focus on the regime where the resistance of the n - s interface is negligeable compared to the metallic resistance of the wire .",
    "let us consider a sample made of a normal metal in contact with a superconductor .",
    "at a temperature well below the superconducting transition of s and at low bias voltage , the thermal energy @xmath8 and the electrostatic energy @xmath9 are much smaller than the gap of s. as a consequence , normal electrons arriving on the n - s interface can not find any available states in s and are andreev - reflected @xcite .    in the andreev reflection ,",
    "the electron is reflected as a hole , while a cooper pair is transmitted in the superconductor , see fig .",
    "[ andreev ] .",
    "the spin and every component of the electron momentum are reversed . in this scope ,",
    "a n - s interface is similar to a phase - conjugating mirror in optics .",
    "as it has the opposite momentum , the reflected hole traces back the path of the incident electron .",
    "the phase acquired by the electron is `` eaten up '' as the hole retraces back the trajectory of the incident electron .",
    "the electron and the hole do not form a pair since they are not present at the same time in the metal , but the andreev reflection correlates two electron states in n. the reflection of the hole may also be seen as the absorption of an electron by the superconductor . in this scope , two electrons travel on the same path through the n metal and are absorbed as a cooper pair in s. this effect can be reversed , so that an electron pair from s can diffuse in the n metal . in the following , we will indifferently use both languages : reflection of an electron into a hole ( and vive - versa ) or diffusion of an electron pair in n.    = 13 cm    if one looks more precisely , the reversal of the electron momentum is perfect only at the fermi level .",
    "let us consider an electron with a small extra energy @xmath10 with respect to the fermi level energy @xmath11 .",
    "its wave - vector @xmath12 slightly differs from the fermi wave - vector @xmath13 .",
    "the reflected hole has a slightly different wave - vector @xmath14 , see fig [ andreev ] .",
    "the incident electron and the reflected hole have a difference @xmath15 in the perpendicular component of the wave - vector so that : @xmath16    let us now focus on the case where the normal metal is in the dirty limit .",
    "this limit is valid when the coherence length of electron pairs ( defined below ) is much larger than the elastic mean free path .",
    "we will also assume that the phase - breaking length @xmath6 is much larger than the sample length @xmath17 . by diffusing over a distance @xmath17 in n , the phase difference between the two electrons of the diffusing pair increases monotonically .",
    "after diffusion during a time @xmath18 over a distance @xmath19 from the interface , the phase shift is : @xmath20 where we introduce the energy - dependent coherence length : @xmath21 @xmath22 being the diffusion coefficient in n. the eq .",
    "[ dephasage ] means that the phase drift between the two components of the diffusing pair will be small as long as @xmath17 is small compared to @xmath23 . in this regime ,",
    "the two electrons are scattered in the same way by impurities and their trajectories are quite the same . as a consequence ,",
    "the two electrons appear as linked in pair .    at a distance of the order of @xmath24 ,",
    "the phase difference is non - negligeable . at the same time , the trajectories of the electron and the hole are separated by a distance or order of the fermi wavelength @xcite .",
    "further scattering of the two particles will therefore be decorrelated and the pair will break apart .",
    "for this reason , we call @xmath24 the coherence length of the electron pair .    it is remarkable that the coherence length @xmath23 coincides with the thermal length @xmath25 at the energy @xmath26 .",
    "the length @xmath25 is usually given in the textbooks @xcite as the characteristic decay length for the proximity effect .",
    "the thermal length @xmath27 is characteristic of a thermal equilibrium electron distribution while the coherence length @xmath24 is characteristic of electrons at a given energy . at the fermi level ,",
    "the coherence length @xmath23 is infinite , independently of temperature .",
    "the actual coherence length is limited by the phase - breaking length @xmath6 of a single electron . in conclusion ,",
    "the effective coherence length of an electron pair in n varies from about the thermal coherence length @xmath25 ( at @xmath28 ) to the phase - coherence length @xmath2 at low energy ( at @xmath29 ) .",
    "the phase drift between the electron and the reflected hole can also be written as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the thouless energy of a sample of length @xmath17 .",
    "the interpretation of eq .",
    "[ thouless ] is again very simple . at a given distance @xmath17 , only electrons with an energy below the thouless energy @xmath32",
    "are still correlated in pairs .",
    "the diffusion of superconductivity in any inhomogenous structure can be described by the gorkov green s functions . in the limit where all the experimentally - relevant length scales are much larger than the fermi wavelength ,",
    "the simplification of this fully quantum theory into the quasiclassical theory is valid . in the diffusive regime where the elastic mean free path is small , the usadel equations @xcite are obtained . in this framework ,",
    "the weak localization effects and the conductance fluctuations are neglected .",
    "the quasiclassical theory has been developped in its full integrity by many groups @xcite .",
    "a review of the applications of this theory to the field of mesoscopic superconductivity is included in this volume @xcite . here",
    "we would like to present a simplified version that keeps the essential physical features of the original theory .",
    "for instance , it is very convenient to linearize the usadel equation .",
    "this is acceptable in most of the experimental situations as far as the distance from the interface is not too small compared to the thermal length @xmath25 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the usadel equations reduce to an equation for the pair amplitude @xmath33 in the normal metal : @xmath34 the pair amplitude @xmath33 is a two - variables function of the position @xmath35 and the energy @xmath10 .",
    "we neglected here the pairing interaction in n and the inelastic scattering .",
    "the eq . [ diffusion ] can be intuitively understood as a diffusion equation for the pair amplitude . from the equation",
    ", one can derive the following facts : ( i ) the natural length scale of the pair amplitude diffusion is @xmath23 ; ( ii ) the diffusion is bound by an exponential cut - off at the distance @xmath2 .",

    "[ usadel ] shows the analytically - calculated real and imaginary parts of the pair amplitude .",
    "the units of the horizontal axis can be read either as the distance x from the s interface in units of the coherence length @xmath23 , or as the square root of the energy @xmath10 above the fermi level in units of the local energy scale @xmath37 related to the distance @xmath35 .",
    "this energy scale coincides with the thouless energy for @xmath38 .    as any of the two variables ( energy or position ) increases ,",
