    "chu and matsui  @xcite employed the concept of color screening  @xcite and presented a model to analyze the quarkonia suppression in quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . since then various experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies have been carried out on charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "bottomonium suppression is considered as a more preferred probe in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments since its enhancement in the qgp medium is expected to be negligible even at the energies available at the lhc .",
    "the lhc data on bottomonium suppression  @xcite at mid rapidity have been analyzed using a model based on color screening and gluonic dissociation along with collisional damping  @xcite .",
    "however , in the above model , the formation time of bottomonia was taken independent of the temperature .",
    "this is not strictly valid . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the @xmath3 bonding is weakened due to debye color screening , which leads to a decrease in the binding energy and hence an increase in the formation time .",
    "the formation time is a key ingredient for the color screening model .",
    "its modification can significantly impact bottomonia suppression and consequently it is important to model the modification of formation time due to qgp temperature .",
    "the incorporation of the temperature effect on the formation time to model the quarkonia suppression is currently lacking in the literature . here , we propose a method to estimate the formation time at different temperatures employing the solution of a time - independent schrdinger wave equation .",
    "we compare the outcome of this method with those obtained via the solution of a time dependent schrdinger wave equation .",
    "it is difficult to obtain the initial wavefunction for the time dependent schrdinger equation exactly .",
    "we heuristically arrive at the initial waveform .",
    "the heuristics and the associated uncertainties are described in detail in sec .",
    "iii ( b ) .",
    "it is expected that the gluonic dissociation and collisional damping play a prominent role only after the quarkonia is formed i.e. , after the quarkonia formation time .",
    "however , due to increased formation time with temperature , the separation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is considerable even before @xmath2 is fully formed . with a temperature - dependent formation time , the role of gluon - induced dissociation and collisional damping in bottomonia suppression before the bottomonium formation time may not be neglected . in view of the above facts ,",
    "it becomes necessary to put forward a suppression model based on temperature - dependent formation time in order to analyze the experimental data .",
    "furthermore , the cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects on bottomonia can contribute significantly at the energies available at the lhc .",
    "shadowing , nuclear absorption , and the cronin effect are the main components of cnm effects .",
    "there have been studies on the initial state collisional and radiative energy loss in cnm , which can affect the nuclear modification factor , @xmath6  @xcite . however",
    ", we do not include these initial - state energy - loss effects in the current work .",
    "it has been argued that , as energy increases from the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) to the large hadron collider ( lhc ) via the bnl relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) experiments , the absorption is expected to become less and less prominent  @xcite .",
    "the quark and antiquark in the @xmath7 pair immediately after being formed are very close to each other and hence the pair behaves almost as a color singlet and has negligible interaction with the nucleus , leading to almost no absorption . with higher energies , the @xmath7 pair size is expected to be even smaller when it crosses the nucleus leading to even smaller absorption . because we describe @xmath8 integrated suppression data , the modeling of the @xmath8 broadening due to the cronin effect is irrelevant .",
    "this leaves shadowing as the principal cnm effect that needs to be incorporated .",
    "there are various shadowing models available  @xcite in the literature . for the purpose of modeling the shadowing effect ,",
    "we explore two different approaches . in the first approach",
    ", we employ the framework developed by vogt  @xcite which is based on the shadowing parametrization first derived by eskola et al .  @xcite . from now",
    "onwards we refer to this shadowing parametrization as _",
    "eps09_. in the second approach , which is a new approach proposed by us , we use the shadowing obtained by _",
    "eps09 _ for the nuclei whose atomic mass is identical to or at least close to @xmath9 . for instance , if @xmath10 , then each nuclei provides @xmath11 nucleons for the reaction .",
    "the effective shadowing would mainly be a function of these @xmath11 nucleons .",
    "interestingly , we find that the two approaches yield similar results .",
    "the shadowing effect , being related to the parton distribution function in the heavy nuclei , is expected to be an initial - state effect and should have the same or similar effect independent of the final state of heavy quarkonium ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 etc ) .",
    "we use the same shadowing effect in all the final bottomonium states .    in the current work ,",
    "we describe a comprehensive model by incorporating the effect of temperature on formation time , color screening , gluon - induced dissociation , and collisional damping along with cnm effects .",
    "all these effects are modeled analytically .",
    "the results of the model are compared with the recent centrality dependent cms data  @xcite at mid rapidity obtained from the lhc experiments .",
    "the organization of the rest of the article is as follows .",
    "section ii , briefly describes the color screening , gluonic dissociation , and collisional damping that have been used in this work .",
    "section iii describes how the temperature dependent formation time has been modeled .",
    "cnm effects are also described in this section .",
    "section iv gives the results and the comparison with the cms data .",

    "the color screening model used in the present work is based on the pressure profile  @xcite in the transverse plane and the cooling law for pressure based on a quasiparticle model ( qpm ) equation of state ( eos )  @xcite for the qgp .",
    "it is described in detail in refs .",

    "is then averaged over a bose - einstein distribution function of gluons at temperature @xmath32 as : @xmath57 with @xmath58 = @xmath11 for gluons .",

    "the point of intersection gives the formation time as @xmath105 fm for @xmath85 for the most central bin .",
    "we now compare the above method of determining the formation time with another one based on the solution of a time - dependent schrdinger wave equation : @xmath106 \\psi_t(r , t_0),$ ] where @xmath107 is the hamiltonian with the potential term given in eq .",

    "2 ) we define the formation time as the earliest time at which the @xmath2 becomes stable .",
    "we say that the @xmath2 has become stable when the wavefunction ceases to expand , i.e. , when @xmath115    because the effect of temperature can only widen the wavefunction and thus increase the formation time ( as compared to formation time in vacuum ) , the simulation for a particular state of @xmath2 is started at a time equal to the formation time @xmath116 for that state in vacuum . at any point of time",
    ", the @xmath2 wavefunction influenced by the qgp medium would be expected to have much larger separation between the quark and antiquark , as compared to the quark - antiquark separation within the bottomonium wavefunction in vacuum which has evolved for the same amount of time .",
    "this is realized by the non zero value of the temperature @xmath117 , at which the initial wavefunction is determined .",
    "in fact , for this reason , there is a need to apply a lower bound on the value of @xmath117 to a value higher than @xmath88 mev . in view of the above arguments",

    "we find that the @xmath120 criteria exists when we start with @xmath121 at any small value of temperature @xmath32 , including @xmath122 mev .",
    "based on the above arguments , we choose @xmath123 mev .",
    "however , for @xmath87 and @xmath86 , the value of temperature varies from @xmath124 mev to @xmath125 mev depending upon the centrality .    with the above framework for the time dependent schrdinger equation ,",
    "the simulation results for the three states of @xmath85 , @xmath87 and @xmath86 are shown in figs . 3 , 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "we find that the method based on the time - dependent schrdinger equation follows the trend of the formation time as a function of centrality as determined by our proposed method , i.e. , by solving the time - independent schrdinger equation .",
    "differences in the two curves could possibly be due to the uncertainty in the initial conditions .",
    "for central collisions , the time interval for which the time - dependent schrdinger equation is simulated is large ( since the formation time is large ) , and errors in the initial conditions probably have a lesser impact .",
    "but for peripheral collisions where the time interval of simulation is much smaller , the impact of the initial conditions is much larger . in the results section ,",
    "we describe the @xmath2 suppression by using both the sets of formation time and we show that the difference is almost negligible . at the same time , we also show that the suppression obtained by ignoring the effect of temperature @xmath32 on the formation time and using the @xmath32-dependent formation time is significantly different .      as mentioned in the introduction , nuclear absorption",
    "is expected to be quite small and the cronin effect irrelevant , the main cnm effect is therefore shadowing .",
    "thus , only the shadowing effect has been used to determine the contribution of suppression arising due to the cnm effect .",

    "<S> the current model includes the modification of the formation time based on the temperature of the qgp , color screening during bottomonium production , gluon induced dissociation and collisional damping due to the imaginary part of the potential between the @xmath1 pair . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method for determining the temperature - dependent formation time of bottomonia using the solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation and compare it with another approach based on time - dependent schrdinger wave equation simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these two independent methods based on different axioms give similar results for the formation time . </S>",
    "<S> cold nuclear matter effects and feed - down from higher resonance states of @xmath2 have also been included in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of the bottomonium states at mid rapidity is determined as a function of centrality . </S>",
