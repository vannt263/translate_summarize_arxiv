    "tz  eridani ( bd -6@xmath13880 ) is an algol - type ea eclipsing binary of short period , @xmath14 days .",
    "the total primary eclipse is 2.5 mag deep in the @xmath11 band .",
    "the estimation of the spectral type of the two components is f ( cannon , 1934 ) , f8 ( brancewicz & dvorak , 1980 ) for the primary , and k0iv ( kaitchuck & park , 1988 ) , k0 ( yoon et al . , 1994 ) for the secondary .",
    "however , as shown in this paper , the most probable spectral types are a5/6  v for the primary and k0/1  iii for the secondary .    a first estimate of the physical parameters of the components is given by brancewicz & dvorak ( 1980 ) , in their `` catalogue of parameters for eclipsing binaries '' , in particular @xmath15 r@xmath1 ( primary component ) and @xmath16 r@xmath1 .",
    "recall that these values have not been obtained by a simultaneous treatment of the complete light and radial velocity curves .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to perform such a new analysis , by using the method and the computer programme of wilson & devinney ( 1971 ) .",
    "no complete light or radial velocity curves have been yet published for tz eri .",
    "for that reason , this star was measured intensively in the 7-colour geneva photometric system ( golay , 1980 ; rufener , 1988 ) using the swiss telescope at la  silla ( european southern observatory , chile ) equipped with the two - channel aperture photometer p7 ( burnet & rufener , 1979 ) . moreover",
    ", the radial velocity curve of the primary component has been determined with the spectrovelocimeter coravel installed on the 1.54  m danish telescope at la  silla , and with the illinois cassegrain ( `` white '' ) spectrograph attached to the 1  m illinois reflector at mount laguna observatory .",
    "in addition , one spectrum of the secondary component has been obtained by using the ntt 3.5  m telescope at la  silla , allowing the determination of the masses of the two components of tz  eri .",
    "tz  eri was discovered to have a disk ( kaitchuck & honeycutt , 1982 ) on the basis of emission in h@xmath17 and h@xmath18 lines observed during the eclipse .",
    "kaitchuck & park ( 1988 ) showed that this disk belongs to the class of the transient accretion disks which are produced by a collision of the gas stream with the mass - gaining star ( primary component ) .",
    "the radius of the disk was measured by the duration of the presence of h@xmath17 line in emission after the start of the primary eclipse ( second contact ) or before the end of the same eclipse ( third contact ) .",
    "the disk extension is variable from one eclipse to another , and in most cases between the trailing and leading sides . during the 12 eclipses studied , the disk extension @xmath19 varied from 1.0 to 1.64 .    in this paper ,",
    "the variation of the period of tz  eri will be analysed , the variability of the components will be examined , and the physical parameters of the two components will be determined from the analysis of the light and radial velocity curves .",
    "the orbital period listed in the gcvs ( kholopov , 1985 ) is @xmath20 days .",
    "however , we are dealing here with a semi - detached system which , by definition , has a variable period due to mass transfer . during most photometric observations done in 1984 - 1987 by dr .",
    "zdenek kviz , the period remained fairly constant , since it was possible to obtain a well - defined lightcurve with @xmath21 days .",
    "this value was obtained using the reciprocal @xmath22 test of renson ( 1978 )  see also manfroid et al .",
    "( 1991 )  which had been defined above all for ap stars ( which vary with small amplitudes ) but proved very efficient for a precise determination of the period of eclipsing binaries .",
    "the ephemeris we have adopted is  :    @xmath23    the orbital period has varied , as shown by the times of minima registered over decades by amateur astronomers .",
    "the @xmath24 values so obtained , and published in the bsag bulletin ( e.g. locher 1997 ) are shown in figure 1 together with a parabolic fit which gives  :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 = 2446109.6922 .",
    "the typical error on the epochs of primary minima in fig .",
    "1 is a few minutes ( 0.002 - 0.005 d. ) .",
    "therefore the fit only represents a mean trend , upon which are superposed sudden period changes that can not be accounted for by measurement errors ( see especially the very steep rise just before jd 2450000 ) .",
    "although the period changes are interesting by themselves , they are rather a nuisance in our context , because the radial - velocity measurements , which were made recently , have to be put in phase with the photometric ones , which are much older . for this reason we have not used the above formula for @xmath24 , but we have simply used additional photometric measurements kindly made by marc knzli in november 1996 with the same equipment .",
    "he has made 36 new multicolour measurements , several of which during the primary minimum . using the code ebop16 ( etzel , 1989 ) and the adopted ephemeris , we adjusted the @xmath27 parameter ( phase correction for the position of the primary minimum ) for these recent data , as well as for the old data alone .",
    "the difference is  :    @xmath28    and represents the phase correction to be applied to the 1996 data , to fit them into the adopted ephemeris .",
    "although the @xmath29 observations have been made one year earlier than the new photometric ones , we neglect the slight period change that may have occurred in between , compared to the change that has taken place between the old photometric measurements and the @xmath29 ones . therefore , the above phase shift was applied as such to the @xmath29 data .",
    "geneva 7-colour photometric measurements of tz  eridani were obtained from dec 10 , 1983 to dec 10 , 1996 , using the swiss 70  cm telescope at the european southern observatory ( eso ) , la silla , chile . during this period ,",
    "393 measurements of weight @xmath30 have been obtained ( see rufener , 1988 , for the definition of the weight q ) .",
    "these data are listed in table  1 , together with the 36 additional photometric measurements obtained in nov - dec 1996 ( see section  2 ) .",
    "the magnitudes in each of the seven filters are obtained from the visual magnitude @xmath11 and the six colour indices in the following manner :    @xmath31 + [ i - b]\\ ] ]    with i representing one of the seven filters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath11 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , g. remember that the geneva @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] indices are not normalized to zero for an a0v star as it is the case for the johnson ubv indices .",
    "it is possible to calculate the magnitude of the primary ( mass gainer ) by subtracting the flux of the secondary ( mass loser ) , at the bottom of the primary eclipse , from the flux of the both components measured together ( outside the eclipses ) .",
    "this calculation has been made for each of the seven geneva magnitudes . in order to minimize the effects of a possible long - term variability ( see the end of this section ) , only the data obtained in december 1983 and january 1984 have been used .",
    "the results are given in table  2 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the observed uncertainties with the mean precision of the measurements made in geneva photometry .",
    "rufener ( 1988 , fig .",
    "2 ) has shown the shape of the mean relation @xmath39 vs. @xmath11 obtained for the non - variable stars , in particular the progressive increase of @xmath39 with increasing @xmath11 , for stars fainter than @xmath40 .",
    "the same relation can be applied to the seven geneva magnitudes .",
    "2 of this paper shows a new calculation of this relation , based on the up to date version of our photometric database . on the same figure",
    "are plotted the observed values for tz  eri given in table  2 .",
    "a correction has been applied to the uncertainties of the magnitudes for the secondary , because the measurements obtained during the totality of the primary eclipse had shorter integration time than the other ones ( 4 minutes instead of 12 minutes ) .",
    "the conclusion is that the uncertainties on the measurements of tz  eri are in agreement with the expected precision .",
    "thus , the components do not exhibit a short - term variability , i.e on a time - scale shorter than about 20 orbital periods .",

    "a photometric classification of the components of tz  eri can be obtained because the primary eclipse is total , by using various calibrations based on the colour indices and reddening free parameters of the geneva photometric system .    from the magnitudes in table  2 ,",
    "the various geneva colour indices and reddening free parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see golay , 1980 ) have been calculated .",
    "then , the technique of the _ photometric boxes _ ( golay et al . , 1969 ; nicolet , 1981a ) has been applied to determine the intrinsic characteristics of the primary component . recall that this technique is specific to the geneva photometric system and depends on the homogeneity and precision of its measurements .",
    "the assumption in this technique is that the properties of the stars lying within a specified photometric neighbourhood ( see nicolet , 1994 ) can be equated with each other , provided that the radius of the photometric box is small enough .",
    "we applied the technique to the parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 of the primary and found in the entire photometric database 40 twin stars , i.e. stars having very similar values of the 3 parameters , the radius of the photometric box having been chosen equal to 0.015 mag .",
    "it is assumed that these stars are intrinsically similar to the primary of tz  eri .",
    "the same method was applied to the classification of the components of the eclipsing rs  cvn - type system rz  eridani ( burki et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "it is especially noteworthy that 6 of these twin stars belong to open clusters  : @xmath73per , hyades , praesepe , pleiades ( 2 stars ) and ngc  6405 .",

    "the primary s radial velocity curve has been measured with the coravel scanner ( baranne et al .",
    "1979 ) in december - january 1995 - 1996 .",
    "the cross - correlation dip is rather wide and shallow due to the fast axial rotation , so that the scatter of the residuals around the fitted curve is rather large ( several kms@xmath80 ) .",

    "the rotational velocity of the primary deduced from the standard calibration of the width of the correlation dip measured with coravel ( benz & mayor , 1984 ) , is @xmath93 which is slightly faster than the synchronous rotation value , since with a radius @xmath94 ( see section  6 ) , the expected equatorial velocity of the primary is 33.0 kms@xmath80 .",

    "we used the wd programme in mode  5 , adapted for semi - detached systems , allowing a simultaneous computation on the seven geneva photometric light curves , based on 393 measurements ( see section  3 ) , and the radial velocity curves of both components ( see table  4 ) .",
    "lobe filling of the cool loser component was assumed .",

    "orbital eccentricity is fixed to zero and longitude of the periastron to @xmath122 .",
    "primary star temperature was fixed to 7770  k as determined in section  4 .",
    "for both components , the stellar atmosphere models of kurucz ( 1994 ) integrated by nicolet ( 1998 ) through the geneva photometry passbands ( rufener & nicolet , 1988 ) have been used .",
    "the bolometric albedos for hot and cool components were taken at the theoretical value of @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively ( radiative and convective cases ) .",
    "noise was set to 1 because scintillation can been neglected , the photon noise being dominant ( see bartholdi et al . , 1984 ) .",
    "the grid resolution values were taken as 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 for n1 , n2 , n1l and n2l respectively ( see wd programme ) .",
    "for each of the seven geneva magnitudes , the passband mean wavelength @xmath125 was the one calculated by rufener & nicolet ( 1988 ) as shown in table 6 .",
    "we assigned the @xmath125 value for the @xmath33 filter to the passband of the spectrographs used for the radial velocity measurements .",
    "stellar rotation is assumed to be synchronized for both components .",
    "for both the primary and secondary components , a logarithmic limb - darkening law of the form  :    @xmath126    was assumed ( van hamme , 1993 ) . for the secondary",
    ", both @xmath127 and @xmath128 parameters were fixed to their theoretical values , interpolated from table 2 of van hamme ( 1993 ) . indeed , the secondary minimum is too shallow to allow the determination of @xmath91 . for the primary ,",
    "the @xmath90 parameter was fixed to its theoretical value , because it is not possible in practice to determine both @xmath129 and @xmath90 parameters since they are strongly correlated .",
    "the @xmath129 parameter , on the contrary , was left free and was fitted in the least - squares procedure , for each of the seven passbands .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are listed in table 7 , while the fitted values of @xmath129 are given in table 8 .",
    "the gravity darkening exponent @xmath130 is relevant to the secondary component and is defined by the expression ( wilson & biermann , 1976 )  :    @xmath131    where @xmath132 is the local effective temperature , @xmath133 is the temperature at a reference point which here is the component s pole , and @xmath134 , @xmath135 are the accelerations due to gravity at the same respective points .",
    "the adjustable parameters are then semi - major axis @xmath9 , inclination @xmath107 , mass ratio @xmath109 , cool star temperature @xmath105 , hot and cool star luminosities @xmath136 and @xmath137 in each passband , cool star gravity darkening exponent @xmath112 ( see wilson & biermann , 1976 ) , hot star limb darkening coefficient @xmath119 in each passband and potential @xmath110 at the hot star surface . in reality",
    ", @xmath138 is a non - dimentional parameter which is a linear function of the true potential @xmath139 ( kopal , 1959 ; wilson & devinney , 1971 ) .",
    "first , preliminary light curves were generated using the _ light curve _ sub - programme of wd until a satisfactory fit to the observed light curves was obtained .",
    "second , the method recommended by van hamme & wilson ( 1986 ) was applied for the determination of the temperature and luminosity of the cool component . in a first step ,",
    "@xmath105 was determined with ipb option ( see the wd programme ) equal to 0 , i.e. the luminosity is coupled to the temperature . in a second step , temperature and luminosity were de - coupled ( @xmath140 ) , and it was possible to determine @xmath137 .",
    "finally , the following sets of parameters were adjusted  : first , successively ( @xmath105 , @xmath110 , @xmath107 ) , ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) , ( @xmath9 , @xmath107 ) , ( @xmath119 , @xmath112 ) , and then simultaneously ( @xmath9 , @xmath107 , @xmath110 , @xmath86 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) , as recommended by the users of the wd programme .",
    "the solution was carried out to the point where the probable errors of all these parameters were smaller than the computed parameter corrections .",
    "since the photometric temperature of the primary star is determined with an uncertainty of @xmath141 k ( see section  4 ) , it is interesting to calculate the solution also for the two @xmath104 values 7670 k and 7870 k. the results are presented in table 8 .",
    "the differences are very small , except of course on @xmath105 .",
    "it is especially noteworthy that , for @xmath142 k , the value of @xmath105 ( @xmath143 k ) is very close to the value obtained in section  4 on the basis of the photometric calibrations .",
    "the mass ratio @xmath144 in table  8 is a little smaller than the value derived from the radial velocity analysis ( @xmath145 , see table  5 ) , but still well within the uncertainty of the spectroscopic determination .",
    "a similar difference can be noted on the semi - major axis of the relative orbit @xmath146 ( @xmath147 r@xmath1 in table  5 and @xmath10 r@xmath1 in table  8) .",
    "these differences are not surprising .",
    "we have to recall that the radial velocity curve for the secondary component is based on only one measurement .",
    "the constraints imposed by the photometric measurements of the eclipses produced an improvement of the orbital and physical parameters of tz  eri .",
    "the small difference between the photometric and spectroscopic values of @xmath86 could indicate that the lobe filling by the secondary is not complete .",
    "if this were true , the real value of the uncertainty on @xmath86 would be larger than the photometric value ( 0.0003 ) , may be as large as the spectroscopic value ( 0.013 ) .",
    "nevertheless , test solutions have been obtained with the cool star slightly detached from its roche lobe , and the results are less satisfactory than those obtained in mode  5 of the wd code  : as the cool star became farther detached from the lobe , solution errors grew .",
    "this confirms the semi - detached status of the system .",
    "the uncertainties on the derived parameters are of three types  :     intrinsic , i.e. resulting from the mathematical analysis of the light and radial velocity curves ( e.g. @xmath12 2 k on @xmath148 , see table  8) .",
    "note that the intrinsic errors on @xmath149 for @xmath9 fixed are an order of magnitude smaller than the values in table  9 .     strongly correlated with the determination of @xmath9 .",
    "for example , in table  9 , the errors on @xmath150 , @xmath149 and @xmath151 almost entirely come from the uncertainty on @xmath9 , and are pair wise strongly correlated ( as well as with @xmath9 ) .     depending on the photometric determination of @xmath152 .",
    "for example , the values of @xmath153 strongly depend on the adopted value for @xmath152 .",
