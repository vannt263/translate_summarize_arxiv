    "in recent years there has been a growing interest in quantum field theory over noncommutative spaces@xcite , that is spaces where the space - time coordinates @xmath11 , replaced by hermitian operators @xmath12 , do not commute : @xmath13=i \\theta_{\\mu \\nu}\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is a real and antisymmetric object with the dimensions of length - squared and corresponds to the smallest patch of area in physical space one may observe , similar to the role @xmath15 plays in @xmath16=i \\hbar \\delta_{ij}$ ] , defining the corresponding smallest patch of phase space in quantum mechanics . in this paper",
    "we define the energy scale @xmath17 ( where @xmath14 is the average magnitude of an element of @xmath18 ) which is a more convenient parameterization in constructing an effective theory at low energies .",
    "many researchers set @xmath19 to avoid problems with unitarity and causality , but since this is only an issue at energies above @xmath20@xcite , we do not use this constraint for the purposes of low - energy phenomenology .",
    "we may view @xmath18 as a `` background @xmath21-field '' which has attained a vacuum expectation value , hence appearing in the lagrangian as a lorentz tensor of constants@xcite .",
    "assuming that the components of @xmath18 are constant over cosmological scales , in any given frame of reference there is a special `` @xmath0 direction '' given by the vector @xmath22 .",
    "experiments sensitive to @xmath6 will therefore be measuring the components of @xmath23 , and it is necessary to take into account the motion of the lab frame in this measurement . since @xmath0 effects are measured in powers of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are some momenta involved in the measurement , it is possible that odd powers of @xmath14 will partially average to zero if the time scale of the measurement is long enough .",
    "effects of first order in @xmath14 vanish at a symmetric @xmath26-collider , for example , if the measurement averages over the entire @xmath27 solid angle of decay products .",
    "if the data is binned by angle then it is possible to restore the sensitivity to @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to any other averaging process over short time scales , terrestrial experiments performed over several days will only be sensitive to the projection of @xmath23 on the axis of the earth s rotation . of course binning the data hourly or at least by day / night , taking into account the time of year , can partially mitigate this effect .",
    "this axis , as well as the motion of the solar system , galaxy , @xmath28 , does not vary over time scales relevant to terrestrial experiments .",
    "the basic idea of @xmath6 is not new and has been known in the context of string theory for some time@xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to a few of the many excellent reviews of the mathematics of noncommutative space @xcite for a more rigorous understanding of the present material .",
    "noncommuting coordinates are expected on quite general grounds in any theory that seeks to incorporate gravity into a quantum field theory : the usual semi - classical argument is that a particle may only be localized to within a planck length @xmath29 without creating a black hole that swallows the particle , hence @xmath30 ; alternatively , one is led to think of space as a noncommutative algebra upon trying to quantize the einstein theory@xcite .",
    "much research has already gone into understanding noncommutative quantum field theory@xcite ; it is equivalent to working with ordinary ( commutative ) field theory and replacing the usual product by the @xmath31 defined as follows : @xmath32 with this definition ( [ nceqn ] ) holds in function space equipped with a @xmath31 : @xmath33_{\\star}=i \\theta_{\\mu \\nu}\\ ] ] this @xmath31 intuitively replaces the point - by - point multiplication of two fields by a sort of smeared product ( see fig . [ starfig ] ) . indeed",
    "the concept of smearing is borne out in more detailed analysis of 1- and 2- point functions@xcite : spacetime is only well defined down to distances of order @xmath34 so functions of spacetime must be appropriately averaged over a neighborhood of points . in each @xmath35 plane , we must replace @xmath36    examples of theories which have received attention include scalar field theory@xcite , ncqed ( the @xmath0 analog of qed)@xcite , as well as noncommutative yang - mills@xcite ; perturbation theory in @xmath14 is applicable and the theories are renormalizable@xcite . for gauge theories , a suitably adjusted definition of the gauge transformations @xcite permits the construction of @xmath37 theories .",
    "there has been no work explicitly proving that fermion representations are consistent with such theories , however we know that the proof must exist since @xmath6 is derived from a string theory which of course is self - consistent for all gauge groups and representations .",
    "a @xmath0 modification of the standard model(sm ) is possible as a working field theory , at least up to @xmath38 . replacing the ordinary product with the @xmath31 in the lagrangian , the appropriate feynman rules for this @xmath0 sm ( ncsm ) follow straightforwardly and are reproduced in the appendix .",
    "whatever the physics at the planck scale is like , we expect there to be some residual effect at low energies beyond that of classical gravity .",
    "if we parameterize this effect as in ( [ nceqn ] ) , then low energy physics will receive corrections in powers of the small parameter @xmath14 .",
    "several papers have addressed how these corrections may modify observations at an accelerator@xcite , precision tests of qed in hydrogen@xcite , and various dipole moments@xcite ; in general , if @xmath39 , there will be some observable effects in these systems at the next generation of colliders .",
    "this paper aims to investigate the @xmath3 potential of @xmath6 in low energy phenomenology .",
    "the method of computing @xmath0 field theory amplitudes is effected by replacing the ordinary function product with the @xmath31 in the lagrangian .",
    "the theory is otherwise identical to the commuting one ( i.e. the feynman path integral formulation provides the usual setting for doing qft ) : for example a yukawa theory with a scalar @xmath40 , dirac fermion @xmath41 , has the action @xmath42 ( here we have used the fact that @xmath43 , which follows straightforwardly from ( [ star ] ) ) gauge interactions likewise generalize from the standard form ; the action for ncqed for example is @xmath44 where @xmath45_\\star\\ ] ] note the extra term in the field strength which is absent in ordinary qed ; this nonlinearity gives ncqed a nonabelian - like structure .",
    "there will be , for example , 3- and 4-point photon self - couplings at tree level ( see appendix ) .    in momentum space",
    "the @xmath31 becomes a momentum - dependent phase factor which means that the theory effectively contains an infinite number of derivative interactions suppressed by powers of @xmath14 .",
    "this directly exhibits the nonlocal character of @xmath6 . from ( [ yukawa ] ) and ( [ ncqed ] ) we can derive the action for the @xmath0 version of the standard model ( ncsm ) .",
    "we present its content as the list of feynman rules in the appendix .",
    "a central feature of computations in the sm is the presence of divergences and the need to absorb them into counterterms .",
    "the ncsm is similar in this respect , yet it is necessary to renormalize carefully : if one simply uses dimensional regularization and sums virtual energies to infinity , bizarre infrared singularities appear in the theory which are difficult to handle@xcite . to illustrate , consider the loop integral @xmath46 which is finite for @xmath47 but is logarithmically divergent if @xmath48 .",
    "explicitly , we wick - rotate ( [ qloop ] ) , introduce the schwinger parameters@xcite , integrate over momenta , and obtain @xmath49 if we take @xmath48 now , dimensional regularization gives the usual @xmath50 $ ] which we would absorb into a counterterm of the theory .",
    "however for small finite values of @xmath51 we get an approximation of the integral ( [ loop2 ] ) in four dimensions : @xmath52 there is a @xmath53 divergence as @xmath54 which is expected since in this limit the theory tends to the commutative one and reproduces the @xmath50 $ ] divergence mentioned above . this is formally correct , however the theory in this limit is awkward to work with since some contributions will diverge as @xmath54 and must produce final results such as scattering amplitudes which are finite . for the computational purposes of this paper , in which @xmath55 @xmath56 , it is more convenient to regularize with a pauli - vilars regulator with mass @xmath57",
    ". then ( [ loop2 ] ) becomes @xmath58 taking the limit @xmath54 now gives @xmath59 note that in the limit @xmath54 the second term vanishes while the first term reproduces the ordinary(commutative ) loop integral divergence .",
    "we subtract this into a counterterm , while the remaining piece gives a small correction to the commutative theory of @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "renormalizing in this manner guarantees sensible results .",
    "in the sm , there are only two sources of @xmath5 : the irremovable phases in the ckm matrix and the @xmath62 term in the strong interaction lagrangian(the coefficient @xmath63 has to be miniscule to avoid contradicting experiment@xcite ) .    in the ncsm",
    ", there is an additional source of @xmath5 : the parameter @xmath14 itself is the @xmath3 object , which is apparent from the ncqed action ( [ ncqed ] ) considering the transformation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 under @xmath66 and @xmath67 and assuming @xmath68 invariance@xcite . physically speaking ,",
    "an area of @xmath38 represents a `` black box '' in which some or all spacetime coordinates become ambiguous , which in turn leads to an ambiguity between particle and antiparticle .",
    "more detailed work reveals that @xmath14 is in fact proportional to the size of an effective particle dipole moment@xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath6 can actually _ explain _ the origin of @xmath5 . at the field theory level , it is the momentum - dependent phase factor appearing in the @xmath0 theory which gives @xmath5 .",
    "for example , the ncsm w - quark - quark @xmath69 vertex in the flavor basis is @xmath70 once we perform rotations on the quark fields to diagonalize the yukawa interactions , @xmath1 @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the above becomes @xmath73 even if @xmath74 is purely real , there will be some nonzero phases @xmath75 in the lagrangian whose magnitudes increase as the momentum flow in the process increases .",
    "of course , the above phase factor has no effect at tree - level ( suitably redefining all the fields ) but will affect results at 1-loop and beyond .    experimentally , the signal for @xmath6 here is a momentum - dependent ckm matrix ( ncckm ) which we define as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 for quarks @xmath78 .",
    "this matrix is an approximation of the exact ncsm in the perturbative limit where we expand @xmath79 . in the limit @xmath80 , the @xmath81",
    "all go to zero and @xmath82 becomes the ckm matrix @xmath83 in the wolfenstein parameterization@xcite in terms of the small number @xmath84 .",
    "note that @xmath82 is not guaranteed to be unitary , since , in contrast to the sm ckm matrix , @xmath82 is not a collection of derived constants : a given matrix element will attain different values depending on the process it is describing . as an example , suppose we measure a non - zero @xmath85-polarization asymmetry in @xmath86@xcite ; this puts a constraint on the value of @xmath87 _ at the energy scale @xmath88_. we can get another constraint on @xmath87 through a @xmath89 oscillation experiment , but we must take into consideration that this is a measurement at the energy scale @xmath90 . in the former process we would find ( for @xmath91 ) @xmath92 whereas in the latter it would be @xmath93 , so these phases differ by a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "therefore we expect the phenomenology of @xmath82 to be rather different from that of the sm .",
    "in addition to @xmath5 from the weak interaction ( in @xmath82 ) , there will also be @xmath5 from the strong and electromagnetic interactions ( since there are phases entering any vertex with three ( or more ) fields ( see appendix ) ) .",
    "we now turn to the phenomenological implications of these .",
    "the @xmath3 observable of choice in the @xmath96-meson system is @xmath95 which is directly proportional to the imaginary part @xmath97 of the box graph ( see fig .",
    "[ boxfig ] ) : @xmath98 the mass splitting @xmath99 between the long- and short - lived @xmath96 eigenstates is @xmath100@xcite .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath101 in terms of the decay constants @xmath102 , and the loop factor . in the sm ,",
    "the loop factor is @xmath103    where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is a loop function ( see appendix ) . in the sm ,",
    "both charm and top quarks contribute roughly equally to the imaginary part of the loop , and the measured value for @xmath95 puts a constraint on the parameters @xmath106 of the ckm matrix .",
    "however , in the ncsm we must replace the entire loop since the momentum - dependent phases in @xmath82 change how the loop integral behaves .",
    "note the charm quark will dominate the imaginary part of the graph because the phase of the product @xmath107 is a factor of @xmath108 suppressed relative to the phase of @xmath109 ( see ( [ ncckm ] ) ) .",
    "we record the evaluation of the loop integral in the appendix .    if the kaons used in the measurement emerge from a beam with an average velocity @xmath110 in the lab frame , we must average over the motion of the internal constituents of the kaon , since the entire @xmath0 effect is proportional to @xmath111 , where @xmath25 are the momenta of the constituents .",
    "we assume that these momenta have random orientation in the rest frame of the kaon , subject to @xmath112 .",
    "the average over these internal momenta produces a result which is proportional to the velocity of the kaon in the lab frame : @xmath113 .",
    "therefore it is important that the @xmath114 of the beam not be so small as to wash out the signal .",
    "recent determinations of @xmath95 use a reasonable @xmath114@xcite , so we do not concern ourselves further with this caveat .",
    "experiments at an @xmath115 collider ( @xmath55@xcite ) where the center of mass is stationary in the lab frame should , however , see no signal for @xmath95 since @xmath116 . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the data may be sensitive to the time of day .",
    "if there is a component of @xmath23 along the axis of the earth , then given enough statistics there should be a `` day / night effect '' for @xmath95 which , as far as we know , no experiment has looked for .    in the case",
    "@xmath91 ( so the phase from @xmath82 is due entirely to @xmath6 ) , we obtain @xmath117 using @xmath118 , and the latest measurement of @xmath119@xcite , this implies @xmath120 ( see fig . [ epsilonfig ] ) ; in this scenario spacetime becomes effectively @xmath0 at energies above @xmath121 .",
    "direct @xmath5 is measurable in the neutral kaon system as a difference between the rates at which @xmath122 decay into @xmath123 states of pions : @xmath124 then the ratio of direct to indirect @xmath5 is @xmath125 the theoretical computation of this ratio is a challenge in the sm not only because the perturbative description of the strong interaction is not reliable at low energies but also because it is proportional to a difference between two nearly equal contributions , enhancing the theoretical error@xcite .",
    "the most naive way to estimate @xmath126 employs the so - called vacuum - saturation - approximation ( vsa ) which is based on the factorization of four - quark operators into products of currents and the use of the vacuum as an intermediate state ( for more details see@xcite ) .",
    "the estimate is @xmath127 where in the sm @xmath128 represents the @xmath3 phases from the ckm matrix , @xmath129 .",
    "the experiments measure @xmath130 which does not closely match the vsa number , but it is possible to use more elaborate models that agree closely with the measured value@xcite .    in the ncsm",
    "it is no less difficult to compute @xmath126 ; in particular , the extra phases from @xmath6 will become involved in the complicated nonperturbative quark - gluon dynamics .",
    "the best estimate we can make here is ( see appendix [ app : eps ] ) @xmath131 for @xmath132 , we get roughly the same vsa value as in the sm .      the only @xmath3 observation from the @xmath21-system to date , the asymmetry in the decay products of @xmath134 @xcite , is a measurement in the sm of a combination of ckm elements called @xmath133 : @xmath135               \\left[\\frac{v_{cs}^ * v_{cb}}{v_{cs}v_{cb}^*}\\right ]               \\left[\\frac{v_{cd}^ * v_{cs}}{v_{cd}v_{cs}^*}\\right ] \\right)\\ ] ] where the first bracketed factor is from @xmath136 mixing , the second from the observed decay asymmetry , and the third from @xmath137 mixing . in the wolfenstein parameterization ,",
    "@xmath138 which , for @xmath139 , corresponding to a point in the center of the allowed region of the @xmath140 plane@xcite implies @xmath141 .",
    "the most recent experimental world average for this quantity is @xmath142@xcite .    in the ncsm",
    "the corresponding quantity is ( [ sin2beta ] ) with each matrix element @xmath143 replaced by @xmath144 extracted from the relevant process : @xmath145          \\left[\\frac{\\overline{v}_{cs}^ *           \\overline{v}_{cb}}{\\overline{v}_{cs}\\overline{v}_{cb}^*}\\right ]          \\left[\\frac{\\overline{v}_{cd}^ *           \\overline{v}_{cs}}{\\overline{v}_{cd}\\overline{v}_{cs}^*}\\right ] \\right)\\ ] ] of course experiments do nt measure the precise value of a given @xmath144 but rather some combination of them integrated over internal momenta . if we again consider the scenario where @xmath146 then the imaginary parts of these quantities increase roughly proportionally to the momenta involved and we expect the first bracketed term in ( [ sin2beta2 ] ) to dominate since the size of the momenta involved in @xmath136 mixing exceeds that of @xmath147-decay or @xmath137 mixing , @xmath1 @xmath148 .",
    "we therefore set the second and third brackets to unity , obtaining @xmath149 if we use the measurement of @xmath95 to fix @xmath150 , then the ncsm predicts @xmath151 which is not excluded by experiment .",
    "the motion of the quarks inside the @xmath21-meson moreover partially washes out the signal ( see previous discussion for kaons ) as the asymmetry of the @xmath26 collider gives the @xmath136 center - of - mass only a modest boost of @xmath152 in the lab frame .",
    "we conclude that this model predicts that current @xmath21-physics experiments should see a value of @xmath133 which is consistent with zero .",
    "the other two @xmath3 observables commonly defined in @xmath21-physics are @xmath153 and @xmath154 : @xmath155 where @xmath156 can be extracted from @xmath136 mixing and @xmath157 , @xmath158 from neutral and charged @xmath21-decays such as @xmath159 and @xmath160 , for example . in the sm @xmath161 because the ckm matrix @xmath83 is unitary .",
    "the ncsm matrix @xmath82 is not unitary ( see section [ sec : cpviol ] ) , so we expect @xmath162 as these `` angles '' are defined ( by @xmath82 replacing @xmath83 in ( [ angles1 ] ) above ) .",
    "for @xmath91 the parameters @xmath163 in the ncsm assume the following form : @xmath164 in figure [ anglefig ] we plot the sum @xmath165 .",
    "the angles essentially add up to @xmath166 in the same range of @xmath167 which is required by the @xmath95-constraint .",
    "if all the matrix elements of @xmath82 could be measured at the same energy then the unitarity triangle would close exactly . the small deviation from exact closure",
    "is @xmath168 and represents the fact that the angles as defined in ( [ sin2beta2 ] ) and ( [ angles1 ] ) are a combination of amplitudes measured at different energies : @xmath169 ( for @xmath136 mixing ) and and @xmath170 ( for @xmath21 decays ) .",
    "nonzero values of the electric dipole moments ( @xmath171s ) of the elementary fermions necessarily violate @xmath172 , and hence @xmath173 ( assuming the @xmath68 theorem ) .",
    "this follows from the observation that a dipole moment @xmath174 is a directional quantity , so for an elementary particle it must transform like the spin @xmath175 , the only available directional quantum number .",
    "the interation with an external electric field @xmath176 is @xmath177 which is therefore @xmath173-odd .",
    "the presence of an @xmath171 for a particle @xmath41 implies an interaction with the electromagnetic field strength @xmath178 in the lagrangian of the form @xmath179 in the sm this operator is absent at tree level and even at one loop due to a cancellation of the ckm phases .",
    "for the electron , moreover , the @xmath171 ( @xmath180 ) vanishes at two loops and the three - loop prediction is miniscule , of order @xmath181@xcite . for the neutron @xmath171 ( @xmath182 )",
    ", gluon interactions can give rise to a two - loop contribution which is @xmath183 .",
    "upper limits from experiments exist : @xmath184@xcite , @xmath185@xcite .",
    "since the sm predictions of @xmath171s are almost zero , we might expect that new sources of @xmath3 physics from @xmath6 would be observable .",
    "the noncommutative geometry provides in addition a simple explanation for this type of @xmath5 : the directional sense of @xmath174 derives from the different amounts of noncommutivity in different directions ( @xmath1 @xmath186 ) and the size of the @xmath171 , classically proportional to the spatial extent of a charge distribution , is likewise in @xmath6 proportional to @xmath187 , the inherent `` uncertainty '' of space .",
    "the effects of @xmath6 will be proportional to the typical momentum involved , which for an electron @xmath171 observation is @xmath188 . a detailed analysis of the size of the @xmath171 appears in @xcite , but a simple estimate of the expected dipole moment is @xmath189 which gives an apparently strong upper bound : @xmath190 .",
    "although the phenomenologically interesting values of @xmath167 from the @xmath9-sector is well above this bound , we can not exclude the possibility that the actual @xmath171 is much smaller than the above naive estimate , a situation which can arise in supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "since @xmath0 effects are proportional to momentum , we might expect an even stronger constraint by considering the muon @xmath171 in an experiment using relativistic muons , however the experimental bound here is weaker : @xmath192@xcite .    the recent measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon@xcite , @xmath193 , although not a @xmath3 observable , does however provide an interesting constraint on the ncsm .",
    "experiments dedicated to @xmath193 have undergone continual refinement ( for history and experimental details , see@xcite,@xcite ) to the point where @xmath193 is now very precisely known : @xmath194 the experimental technique employs muons trapped in a storage ring .",
    "a uniform magnetic field @xmath21 is applied perpendicular to the orbit of the muons ; hence the muon spin will precess .",
    "the signal is a discrepancy between the observed precession and cyclotron frequencies .",
    "precession of the muon spin is determined indirectly from the decay @xmath195 .",
    "electrons emerge from the decay vertex with a characteristic angular distribution which in the sm has the following form in the rest frame of the muon : @xmath196 where @xmath40 is the angle between the momentum of the electron and the spin of the muon , @xmath197 measures the fraction of the maximum available energy which the electron carries , and @xmath198 are particular functions which peak at @xmath199 .",
    "the detectors ( positioned along the perimeter of the ring ) accept the passage of only the highest energy electrons in order to maximize the angular asymmetry in ( [ asymm ] ) . in this way",
    ", the electron count rate is modulated at the frequency @xmath200 .",
    "although @xmath201 does receive a sizable contribution from @xmath6 , it is a _ constant _",
    "contribution@xcite , @xmath1 the interaction with the external magnetic field @xmath202 is independent of the muon spin , and therefore the experiment described above is not sensitive to this perturbation of @xmath201 .",
    "the effect of @xmath6 on this measurement does however enter in the manner in which the muon spin is measured in its decay .",
    "specifically , the electron decay distribution ( [ asymm ] ) has a slightly different angular dependence due to the departure of the ncsm from the standard v - a theory of the weak interactions ( see figure [ muonfig ] ) .",
    "the electron distribution @xmath203 in the ncsm differs from the sm ( we reserve the details for a future publication ) : @xmath204 the effect of @xmath6 is greater than one would naively expect as , for reasons of efficiency , the muons are stored at highly relativistic energies : @xmath205 .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath206 .",
    "however , the frequency is measured over many cycles and a more conservative estimate of the effective size of the @xmath0 term is closer to @xmath207 the angular distribution is therefore not a pure @xmath208 and we expect the measurement of the precession frequency to differ from the sm prediction at the level of 1 part in @xmath209 .",
    "currently , the discrepancy between the measured value of @xmath201 and the sm prediction is @xmath210 which imposes the constraint @xmath211 .",
    "this bound accomodates the values of @xmath167 inferred from @xmath3 observables in section [ sub : cpviolob ] .",
    "we expect the value of @xmath167 determined from a @xmath10 experiment to be smaller than that from a @xmath9 or @xmath21-physics experiment since the circulation of the muons at their cyclotron frequency introduces an additional averaging of the components of @xmath23 . for a storage ring located at an earth lattitude of @xmath41 degrees , there will be a @xmath212 suppression factor .",
    "the standard model(sm ) is a highly successful effective theory for energies below the weak scale @xmath213 , but it must eventually give way to a description of nature that includes gravity .",
    "noncommutative geometry is one candidate for such a description , exhibiting some features of gravity such as nonlocality and space - time uncertainty .    in this paper",
    "we have considered the potential effects at low eneriges of a noncommutative geometry which sets in at some high scale @xmath20 .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath20 in the @xmath214- range , @xmath0 contributions to @xmath3 observables such as @xmath95 and @xmath8 are competitive with the sm contributions , whereas @xmath151 . if @xmath215 , the predictions of these observables from @xmath6 is consistent with data .",
    "moreover the recent @xmath216 deviation between the sm prediction of @xmath217 of the muon and data is explained in the @xmath0 scenario for this same value of @xmath20 .",
    "these perturbative results in terms of the small parameter @xmath218 are encouraging , but more work is needed in the treatment of the full , nonperturbative theory . nonetheless , noncommutativity of the space - time coordinates offers a more physical interpretation of @xmath5 which , if correct , suggests interesting physics at @xmath214 energies .",
