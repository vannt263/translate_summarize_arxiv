    "in recent years the effect of the spin of electrons on the transport properties of nanostructures have been studied intensively , both theoretically and experimentally . in the context of spin - based electronics ( spintronics ) the possibility to control electrical currents by a weak external magnetic field using the zeeman and/or the spin - orbit interaction is one of the main goals .    magnetic materials and especially half - metals are natural sources of spin - polarized electrons for spintronics .",
    "transport of spin - polarized electrons in nanostructures ( quantum dots , suspended nanowires , etc . ) in external magnetic field results in new phenomena where spin , charge and mechanical degrees of freedom are strongly inter - related . in this new field of investigations ( spintromechanics ,",
    "see ref .  )",
    "the presence of a mechanically  soft \" subsystem results both in a strong enhancement of spintronic effects and in magnetic control of the mechanical subsystem in the classical as well as in the quantum transport regimes .    vibrational effects are known to be important for the transport properties of molecular transistors ( see , e.g. , the reviews in refs .   and ) . in single - molecule transistors",
    "a strong electron - vibron coupling was observed in a @xmath0-based transistor with nonmagnetic ( gold ) leads @xcite .",
    "the measured current - voltage characteristics in this experiment revealed low - energy periodic step - like features .",
    "they were interpreted as a signature of vibron - assisted electron tunneling via the fullerene molecule .",
    "experimental @xmath1 curves were theoretically explained @xcite in the frames of a simple model of a single - level quantum dot strongly coupled to a single vibrational mode and weakly coupled to the source and drain electrodes .    later on @xmath0-based molecular transistors with magnetic ( ni )",
    "leads were fabricated @xcite . in samples",
    "where the tunneling coupling to the ferromagnetic electrodes were relatively strong ( @xmath2 tens of mev ) , kondo - assisted tunneling via the @xmath0 molecule was observed .",
    "these measurements also proved the presence of a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by the ferromagnetic electrodes in the nano - gap between them . in samples with weak tunneling couplings the usual coulomb blockade picture for a single - electron transistor was observed .    in the present paper",
    "we formulate the conditions for the appearance of a vibrational instability of a fullerene molecule suspended in the gap between two magnetic leads with opposite magnetization .",
    "electron shuttling of spin - polarized electrons produced by magnetic ( exchange ) forces was predicted in ref .   for the case of 100% polarization of the leads .",
    "in this limit ( realized for half - metals ) the electric current is blocked ( spin blockade ) in the absence of spin - flips induced by , e.g. , an external magnetic field .",
    "it was shown that in the absence of dissipation in the mechanical subsystem such a magnetic field triggers a shuttle instability even for vanishingly small fields @xcite . in the presence of dissipation a threshold magnetic field",
    "is determined by the rate of dissipation and it is small for a weak dissipation .",
    "one of our aims here is to develop a theory of magnetic shuttling for conditions corresponding to the experimental set - up of ref .  , where the electrons in the ferromagnetic leads were partially polarized ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the absence of a spin blockade in this case qualitatively changes the criterion for electron shuttling .",
