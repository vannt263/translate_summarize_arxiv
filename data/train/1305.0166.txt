    "in july 2012 , the cms and atlas experimental collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) announced the observation of a new boson @xcite , consistent with a higgs particle , the last undiscovered object in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the initial results were based on data corresponding to integrated luminosities of @xmath4fb@xmath5 taken at @xmath6tev and 5.3fb@xmath5 at @xmath7tev and the search was performed in six decay modes : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a @xmath145@xmath15 excess of events with respect to the background was clearly observed in the first and second of these decay modes , while the remaining ones yielded exclusion limits well above the sm expectation .",
    "both collaborations have since been regularly updating their findings @xcite , improving the mass and ( so - called ) ` signal strength ' measurements .    in these searches ,",
    "the magnitude of a possible signal is characterized by the production cross section times the relevant branching ratios ( brs ) relative to the sm expectations in a given higgs boson decay channel @xmath16 , denoted by @xmath17 ( i.e. , the signal strength ) . according to the latest results released by the two collaborations after the collection of @xmath1420 fb@xmath5 of data @xcite , a broad resonance compatible with a 125gev signal is now also visible in the @xmath18 decay channel .",
    "the mass of the observed particle is still centered around 125 gev but the measured values of its signal strength in different channels have changed considerably compared to the earlier results .",
    "these values now read + @xmath19 ,   @xmath20 ,   @xmath21 + at cms , and + @xmath22 ,   @xmath23 ,   @xmath24 + at atlas .",
    "the bulk of the event rates comes from the gluon - gluon fusion channel @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the signal has also been corroborated by tevatron analyses @xcite , covering the @xmath25 decay mode only , with the higgs boson stemming from associated production with a @xmath26 boson @xcite .",
    "however , there the comparisons against the sm higgs boson rates are biased by much larger experimental errors .",
    "if the current properties of the observed particle are confirmed after an analysis of the full 7 and 8tev data samples from the lhc , they will not only be a clear signature of a higgs boson , but also a significant hint for possible physics beyond the sm .",
    "in fact , quite apart from noting that the current data are not entirely compatible with sm higgs boson production rates , while the most significant lhc measurements point to a mass for the new resonance around 125gev the tevatron excess in the @xmath25 channel points to a range between 115gev and 135gev . while the possibility that the sm higgs boson state has any of such masses would be merely a coincidence ( as its mass is a free parameter ) , in generic supersymmetry ( susy ) models the mass of the lightest higgs boson with sm - like behavior",
    "is naturally confined to be less than 180gev or so @xcite .",
    "the reason is that susy , in essence , relates trilinear higgs boson and gauge couplings , so that the former are of the same size as the latter , in turn implying such a small higgs boson mass value .",
    "therefore , the new lhc results could well be perceived as being in favor of some low energy susy realisation .",
    "several representations of the latter have recently been studied in connection with the aforementioned lhc and tevatron data , including the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite ( also the constrained version @xcite of it , in fact ) , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , the e@xmath27-inspired supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath27ssm ) @xcite and the ( b - l ) supersymmetric standard model ( ( b - l)ssm ) @xcite .",
    "all of these scenarios can yield a sm - like higgs boson with mass around 125gev and most of them can additionally explain the excesses in the signal strength measurements in the di - photon channel .",
    "another approach to adopt in order to test the viability of susy solutions to the lhc higgs boson data is to consider the possibility of having cp - violating ( cpv ) phases ( for a general review of cp violation , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in ( some of ) the susy parameters .",
    "these phases can substantially modify higgs boson phenomenology in both the mass spectrum and production / decay rates at the lhc @xcite , while at the same time providing a solution to electroweak baryogenesis @xcite . in the context of the lhc ,",
    "the impact of cpv phases was emphasized long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite and revisited recently in ref .",
    "@xcite following the higgs boson discovery . in all such papers",
    "though , cpv effects were studied in the case of the mssm .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of similar cpv effects in the nmssm .",
    "in particular , we study the possibility to have higgs boson signals with mass around 125gev in the cpv nmssm , which are in agreement with the aforementioned lhc data as well as the direct search constraints on sparticle masses from lep and lhc .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the feasible cpv nmssm signals on the mass of the higgs boson as well as its couplings to both the relevant particle and sparticle states entering the model spectrum , chiefly , through the decay of the former into a @xmath28 pair .",
    "we thus aim at a general understanding of how such observables are affected by the possible complex phases explicitly entering the higgs sector of the next - to - minimal susy lagrangian .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will briefly review the possible explicit cpv phases in the higgs sector of the nmssm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : params ] we will outline the independent cpv nmssm parameters and the methodology adopted to confine our attention to the subset of them that can impinge on the lhc higgs boson data . in the same section , we further investigate the possible numerical values of the complex parameters after performing scans of the low energy cpv nmssm observables compatible with the lep and lhc constraints on higgs boson and susy masses . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our results on the higgs boson mass spectrum as well as signal rates in connection with the lhc . finally , we conclude in sec . [",

    "the cpv phases appearing in the higgs potential of the nmssm at tree - level @xcite can be divided into three categories :    1 .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 : the spontaneous cpv phases of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the up - type higgs doublet @xmath31 and the higgs singlet @xmath32 , respectively , with respect to the down - type higgs doublet @xmath33 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 : the phases of the higgs boson trilinear couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 : the phases of the trilinear soft terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    as explained in @xcite the phases in category 3 .",
    "above are determined by the minimisation conditions of the higgs potential with respect to the three higgs fields .",
    "furthermore , assuming vanishing spontaneous cpv phases in category 1 .",
    "( and real sm yukawa couplings ) , the only actual physical phases appearing in the tree - level higgs potential are those in category 2 as the difference @xmath42 . beyond the born approximation , the phases of the trilinear couplings @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 also enter the higgs sector through radiative corrections from the third generation squarks and stau ( assuming negligible corrections from the first two generations ) . also , in the one - loop effective potential , @xmath34   can contribute independently from @xmath35 .",
    "the complete one - loop higgs mass matrix can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only reproduce the tree - level higgs as well as sfermion mass matrices in appendix a.    the @xmath46 higgs mass matrix @xmath47 , defined in the basis @xmath48 ( after @xmath49-rotating the @xmath50 matrix to isolate the goldstone mode ) , is diagonalized with a unitary matrix @xmath51 to yield five mass eigenstates as @xmath52 where @xmath53 in order of increasing mass . for a nonzero value of any of the phases listed above ,",
    "these mass eigenstates become cp indefinite due to scalar - pseudoscalar mixing . moreover",
    ", these cpv phases not only affect the masses of the higgs states but also their decay widths , since the higgs boson couplings to various particles are proportional to the elements of the unitary matrix @xmath51 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "additionally , alterations in the masses of light neutralinos and charginos , in particular , due to the phases in category 1 above , can also have an indirect impact on the brs of the higgs bosons into sm particles .",
    "the decay widths and brs of the higgs boson in the nmssm with cpv phases can be calculated using the methodology implemented in ref .",
    "explicit expressions for higgs boson couplings and widths in the cpv nmssm can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which follows the notation of @xcite .",
    "these widths and brs can then be used to obtain the signal strength of the @xmath28 channel ( also called _ reduced _ di - photon cross section ) , @xmath54 , defined , for a given higgs boson , @xmath55 , as @xmath56 where @xmath57 implies a sm higgs boson with the same mass as @xmath55 . in terms of the _ reduced _ couplings , @xmath58 ( couplings of @xmath55 with respect to those of @xmath57 ) , eq.([eq : rxsct1 ] ) can be approximated by @xmath59 ^ 2[c_i(\\gamma\\gamma)]^2\\sum_x \\frac{\\gamma^{\\textrm{total}}_{h_\\textrm{sm}}}{\\gamma^{\\textrm{total}}_{h_i } } \\ ] ] where @xmath60 denotes the total width of @xmath57 .",
    "in light of the recent lhc discovery of a sm higgs boson - like particle we scan the parameter space of the cpv higgs sector of the nmssm using a newly developed fortran code . in our scans the lep constraints on the model higgs bosons are imposed in a modified fashion ; i.e. , they have to be satisfied by the scalar and pseudoscalar components of all the cp - mixed higgs bosons .",
    "also imposed are the constraints from the direct searches of the third - generation squarks , stau and the light chargino at the lep .",
    "we point out here that , in the cp - conserving ( cpc ) limit , the higgs boson mass and brs have been compared with those given by nmssmtools @xcite and have been found to differ from the latter by @xmath141% and @xmath145% at the most , respectively .",
    "although no limits from @xmath61-physics or from relic density measurements have been imposed we confine ourselves to the regions the parameter space regions which have been found to comply with such constraints ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    we study the effects of the cpv phases described in the previous section on the mass and di - photon signal rate of a higgs boson predicted by the model that is compatible with the higgs boson discovery data from the lhc .",
    "in particular , we consider the three most likely scenarios specific to the cpv nmssm that comply with the latter . in our analysis",
    ", we assume minimal supergravity ( msugra)-like unification of the soft parameters at the susy - breaking energy scale , such that    @xmath62 , + @xmath63 , + @xmath64 , +    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the soft susy - breaking squared masses of the third - generation squarks and sleptons , respectively .",
    "these parameters are then fixed to their optimal values based on earlier studies @xcite in order to minimize the set of scanned parameters .",
    "we then focus only on the effects of the higgs sector parameters , which include the dimensionless higgs boson couplings @xmath36 and @xmath37 along with their phases @xmath34  and @xmath35 , as well as the soft susy - breaking parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 . from outside the higgs sector , we only analyze the effect of the variation of the unified cpv phase of the third - generation trilinear couplings , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .    before we discuss the three scenarios mentioned above",
    ", we note that the two heaviest higgs boson mass eigenstates @xmath69 and @xmath70 always correspond to the interaction eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath72 in eq.([eq : h - states ] ) .",
    "sits in the position corresponding to @xmath71 in eq.([eq : h - states ] ) before ordering by mass , even though evidently it contains components of the other higgs fields also .",
    "in particular , a sm - like @xmath55 contains adequate components of both @xmath71 and @xmath73 to have sm - like couplings to fermions and gauge bosons . ] hence , a scenario is defined by the higgs state that conforms to the lhc observations , out of the three light mass eigenstates , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and by the correspondence between the latter and the interaction eigenstates @xmath73 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "however , note that such a definition is adopted only so that a distinction between different scenarios can be made conveniently .",
    "evidently , the behavior of the ` observed ' higgs boson , @xmath79 , with the cpv phases in a given scenario is a combined result of the set of parameters yielding that scenario rather than of its position among the mass - ordered higgs states .",
    "the criteria for choosing the ranges of the scanned model parameters as well as the values of the non - higgs - sector susy parameters thus depend on the scenario under consideration and are explained in the following .",
    "+ in this scenario the lightest higgs state , @xmath74 , is the sm - like one and corresponds to @xmath73 , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 correspond to @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the requirement of obtaining a down - type higgs state with mass close to 125 gev and with sm - like couplings necessitates large soft susy masses and @xmath80 .",
    "the values of @xmath81 ( @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the vev of @xmath32 ) and the gaugino masses are found to be in best agreement with the relic density constraints @xcite , giving a neutralino with a large higgsino component as the lightest susy particle .",
    "further , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are chosen such that there is enough mixing of the doublet with the singlet higgs boson so as to allow an @xmath74 with the correct mass while keeping its couplings close to their sm values .",
    "we test two cases for this scenario , corresponding to two representative values of the parameter @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the vevs of @xmath31 and @xmath33 , respectively ) , which is fixed to 8 in case1 and to 15 in case2 .",
    "+ this scenario is defined by the sm - like @xmath14125gev higgs boson being the second lightest higgs boson , @xmath75 , of the model .",
    "there are two possibility entailing such a scenario .",
    "it can be @xmath88-like with a large singlet component , in which case it has @xmath54  sm - like or bigger , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this possibility as case1 of this scenario .",
    "it requires relatively large values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , small values of the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 and moderate values of soft susy - breaking parameters .",
    "for case2 of this scenario , we take a slightly different region of the parameter space which yields a @xmath75 that is again @xmath73-like but with a much smaller singlet component , so that it has @xmath89  around the sm expectation .",
    "therefore , heavy unified soft squark mass and/or trilinear coupling are required in this case , but a light soft gaugino mass is preferred .",
    "@xmath36 can be small to intermediate while @xmath37 is always small .",
    "finally , in this scenario @xmath74 and @xmath76 are @xmath77- and @xmath78-like , respectively .",
    "+ there also exists the possibility that the observed @xmath14125gev higgs boson is the @xmath76 of the model which corresponds to @xmath73 , while both @xmath77- and @xmath78-like higgs bosons are lighter .",
    "such a scenario can be realized for very fine - tuned ranges of the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 for a given @xmath84 value , with large soft squark and gaugino mass parameters preferred .",
    "note that in this case the @xmath78-like @xmath76 of case2 of scenario2 turns into @xmath75 by becoming lighter than the @xmath73-like state which , consequently , turns into @xmath76 .",
    "these two cases thus overlap slightly in terms of the relevant parameter space of the model .",
    "+ note here that we do not consider a scenario with the @xmath14125gev higgs boson corresponding to the @xmath78 interaction eigenstate , since the pure ( or nearly pure ) pseudoscalar hypothesis is disfavored by the cms higgs boson analyses @xcite .",
    "moreover , in scenarios 2 and 3 above the masses of @xmath75 and @xmath76 can lie very close to each other .",
    "in fact , these two higgs bosons can be almost degenerate in mass near 125gev , in which case the signal observed at the lhc should be interpreted as a superposition of individual peaks due to each of them . however , in the nmssm , particularly in the presence of cpv phases , more than one possibilies with mass degenerate higgs bosons may arise ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "such possibilities warrant a dedicated study of their own , which is currently underway , and in this article we have , therefore , not taken any of them into account . for correctness of our results",
    ", we have thus imposed the condition of nondegeneracy during our scans , so that only those points are passed for which no other higgs boson apart from the signal higgs boson under consideration lies inside the mass range of interest , defined in the next section .",

    "we perform scans for each of the scenarios described earlier requiring the mass of @xmath79 ( i.e. , of @xmath74 in scenario1 , @xmath75 in scenario2 and @xmath76 in scenario3 ) to lie in the range 124gev@xmath94127gev .",
    "we additionally impose the condition @xmath95 on the signal higgs boson .",
    "furthermore , to each case in a given scenario corresponds a set of three scans , such that in each of the scans only one of the following cpv phases is varied : + ( i ) @xmath96 ,  ( ii ) @xmath97 ,  ( iii ) @xmath67 , + while fixing the others to @xmath98 .",
    "each scan thus checks the effect of a different cpv source at the tree - level and/or beyond . in each scan",
    "we vary the relevant phase in steps of 1@xmath99 between @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "the measurements of the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron , neutron , and various atoms @xcite put constraints on the allowed values of @xmath34  and @xmath67 . however , the trilinear couplings of squarks and sleptons contribute to the edms only at the two - loop level , and their phases are thus rather weakly constrained .",
    "one can , furthermore , assign very heavy soft masses to the sfermions of first two generations in order to minimize the effect of @xmath67  on the edms , as pointed out in earlier studies for the mssm @xcite .",
    "in fact , such constraints can be neglected altogether by arguing that the phase combinations occurring in the edms can be different from the ones inducing higgs boson mixing @xcite .",
    "the phase of @xmath37 , in contrast , has been found to be virtually unconstrained by the edm measurements @xcite .",
    "below we present our results separately for each of the five cases investigated . for evaluating the effect of the phases on @xmath101  and @xmath102qualitatively",
    ", we choose a set of four representative points ( rps ) , referred to as rp1 , rp2 , rp3 , and rp4 in the following , for every case . as explained in sect.[sec : cpv ] , at the tree - level the only independent cpv phase entering the higgs mass matrix is the difference @xmath103 . at one - loop level , although @xmath34  can appear separately from @xmath35 , the contribution from the corresponding terms is much smaller than the tree - level dependence on @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , since only @xmath104 appears in the diagonal cp - even and cp - odd blocks and only @xmath105 in the cp - mixing block ( see appendix a ) of the higgs mass matrix , the mass eigenstates show a very identical behavior when either of these two phases is varied while fixing the other to 0@xmath99 .",
    "only small differences arise for very large values of @xmath34  and @xmath35  due to the higher - order corrections .",
    "therefore , our rp1 for a given case corresponds to a point for which the effect of @xmath34  ( and equivalently @xmath35 ) on @xmath101  is maximized for that case .",
    "similarly , rp3 is chosen such that the variation in @xmath101  is maximal with @xmath67 , since this phase only appears at the one - loop level and can potentially cause a behavior different from that due to the tree - level cpv phase .",
    "the dependence on @xmath67  can , however , be expected to show an identical behavior across all cases , as it is largely independent of other higgs sector parameters ( except @xmath84 ) , which is indeed what we will observe in our results below .",
    "as already noted , the cpv phases also affect the higgs boson decay widths into fermions and gauge bosons , through the elements of the higgs mixing matrix @xmath51 .",
    "on the other hand , in the decays of a higgs boson into two lighter higgs bosons , the tree - level phase , @xmath103 , enters directly while the phase @xmath67  also enters through the one - loop cp - odd tadpole conditions at one - loop @xcite .",
    "rp2 and rp4 are , therefore , points with the largest effect on @xmath102  due to the variation in @xmath34/@xmath35  and @xmath67 , respectively , observed in our scans .",
    "note that in the discussion below the description of the behavior of a given rp may not be equally applicable to all other good points , since it is chosen only so as to understand the maximum possible impact of a given phase and to highlight some potentially distinguishing features of different cases and scenarios .      in fig.[fig",
    ": s1c1]a we show , for the small @xmath84 case of this scenario , the variation in the number of good points , i.e. , points surviving the conditions imposed on @xmath101  and @xmath102 , with varying @xmath34  and @xmath35 .",
    "the number of surviving points first falls slowly with increasing @xmath34/@xmath35  and then abruptly for @xmath106 after which it remains almost constant for a while before falling further .",
    "the number of surviving points reduces to 0 for @xmath34  and @xmath35  larger than 75@xmath99 and 77@xmath99 , respectively .",
    "however , very few , @xmath1410 , surviving points reemerge for @xmath34  and @xmath35  larger than 155@xmath99 and 150@xmath99 , respectively , although it is not apparent from the figure .",
    "the drop in the number of points is not continuous since there are other parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which are also scanned over for every value of a given phase .",
    "moreover , the number of good points evidently depends on the conditions on @xmath101  and @xmath102  so that while both of these may be satisfied for one value of a phase one of these may be violated for the next .",
    "although , as we shall see below , @xmath101  is almost always mainly responsible for the drop in the number of good points .",
    "note that the cpc case is also subject to the conditions on @xmath101  and @xmath102  and , on account of being defined relative to this case , the number of good points does not represent all possible solutions for all values of the phases .",
    "thus , it is likely that the cpc case for a given parameter set falls outside the defined ranges of @xmath101  and/or @xmath102 , but the conditions on these are satisfied for a different value of a particular phase .",
    "such a value of the phase can thus result in a considerable number of good points which would be absent in the cpc case . nevertheless , the aim here is to give an estimate of the effect of the cpv phases on the number of good points relative to the cpc case , rather than to present a truly holistic picture .",

    "in summary , we have demonstrated that the cpv nmssm offers some interesting solutions to the lhc higgs boson data , which differ substantially from well - known configurations of the cpc nmssm , thereby augmenting the regions of parameter space which can be scrutinized at the cern collider .",
