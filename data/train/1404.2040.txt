    "as shown in table  ii , the rixs scattering operator of the ir @xmath0-edge at @xmath79 has same symmetric property as that of the o @xmath1-edge .",
    "it can be also expected for the ir @xmath0-edge rixs to give rise to the magnetic peak at @xmath79 .",
    "accordingly our numerical calculation yields nonzero magnetic rixs peak of the ir @xmath0-edge at @xmath79 .",
    "figure  [ sfig1 ] presents the magnetic rixs peak of the @xmath80-edge at @xmath79 with respect to bond angle and x - ray polarization .",
    "overall features are totally same as those in the o @xmath1-edge ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) and 3(a ) ) .",
    "the magnetic peak at @xmath79 is only allowed when the ir - o - ir bond is buckled .",
    "the magnetic modes is dominantly picked up at @xmath81 and @xmath82 polarizations .",
    "neither @xmath83 , nor @xmath84 , nor @xmath85 polarization gives any magnetic peak .",
    "thus the broken inversion with oxygen center can induce the magnetic excitation at center of the bz even though its intensity is much more suppressed than that at the edge .",
    "the @xmath0-edge rixs process , however , is not directly related to o states .",
    "for this reason , the magnetic rixs intensity at the ir @xmath0-edge is almost independent with the ir - o hopping strength in contrast with the o @xmath1-edge , of which intensity is proportional to @xmath87 or @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ sfig2 ] describes this feature well . in weak hopping limit ,",
    "total magnetic rixs intensity is almost constant . in strong hopping limit , of course",
    ", even ir @xmath0-edge is remarkably affected due to considerable overlap between local ir multiplet states and charge - transfer states .",

    "<S> the recent discovery that resonant inelastic x - ray scattering can probe single - magnon ( sm ) dispersions in transition metal ( tm ) oxides when the x - ray energy is tuned to the tm @xmath0-edge , has put this technique on a par with inelastic neutron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally presumed that selection rules forbid sm - scattering at oxygen ( o ) @xmath1-edges . </S>",
    "<S> however , based on a symmetry analysis and exact diagonalization study , we show that sm - scattering at o @xmath1-edges becomes allowed when ( @xmath2 ) spin - orbit coupling is present in the tm @xmath3-shell and ( @xmath4 ) inversion symmetry at the o - site is broken . for cuprates </S>",
    "<S> the resulting sm - amplitude is very weak but in iridates both prerequisites can amply be fulfilled .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction  _ the theoretical prediction  @xcite and subsequent experimental observation  @xcite that the dispersion of magnetic excitations , in particular of elementary single - magnons , can be measured directly by resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) has fundamentally changed the field of inelastic magnetic scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has for instance lead to the discovery of distinct paramagnons in a large family of high - temperature cuprate superconductors @xcite , and established the presence of strongly dispersive magnetic modes in a number of iridium oxides  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> all these efforts to extract the dispersion of elementary magnetic excitations from rixs have focussed on the transition metal ( tm ) @xmath0-edge , where single spin - flip scattering is directly allowed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origin of this type of magnetic scattering is rather straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> when energy in rixs the incoming photon is tuned to a tm @xmath0-edge , an electron with spin @xmath5 is excited out of the atomic @xmath6-shell , deep inside the atomic core , into the tm @xmath3-shell . </S>",
    "<S> the core - hole that is created in this event can now flip its spin due its very large spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently a valence @xmath3 electron with spin @xmath7 can fill the core - hole and an outgoing x - ray is emitted . </S>",
    "<S> the net result of this rixs process is a spin - flip transition @xmath8 in the tm @xmath3-shell , which is the same as the net result of inelastic neutron scattering involving this @xmath3-shell electron .    when a @xmath1-edge is used instead of a @xmath0-edge , this direct spin - flip process is no longer allowed . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in @xmath1-edge rixs an electron is excited from a core - shell with @xmath9-symmetry , for which spin - orbit coupling is simply absent . </S>",
    "<S> it thus appears that for rixs at @xmath1-edges direct spin - flip scattering is forbidden and only higher order magnetic scattering processes  starting at double spin - flip ( e.g. bi - magnon ) scattering  are allowed  @xcite . indeed bi - magnon scattering is observed both at tm  @xcite and oxygen ( o ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1-edges  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent absence of single - magnon spin - flip scattering is unfortunate because the o @xmath1-edge is in a soft x - ray regime where the rixs resolution is particularly high ( even if in this situation only a limited part of momentum space is accessible ) and oxygen anions are obviously ubiquitous in magnetic materials .    </S>",
    "<S> however , in this letter we show that single - magnon ( sm ) scattering at o @xmath1-edges is allowed when spin - orbit coupling is present in the tm @xmath3-shell _ and _ inversion symmetry at the o - site is broken . </S>",
    "<S> our symmetry analysis and exact diagonalization study shows that the resulting sm - scattering is allowed for small momentum losses and forbidden for momenta close to the magnetic ordering vector , a situation opposite to magnetic rixs at the tm @xmath0-edge . as in iridates </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit interaction in the @xmath10 shell is large and the inversion symmetry at o - sites is often distinctly broken , as e.g. in the perovskites sr@xmath11iro@xmath12 , sr@xmath13ir@xmath11o@xmath14 , na@xmath11iro@xmath13 and the post - perovskite cairo@xmath13 , we predict pronounced sm - scattering at the o @xmath1-edge of for instance these magnetic oxides .    _ </S>",

    "<S> _ when an incident ( outgoing ) x - ray with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) polarization has the frequency @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and wave vector @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , the rixs intensity is described by the kramers - heisenberg relation  @xcite @xmath21 where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the dipole and fast collision approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitude @xmath24 is reduced to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective rixs scattering operator , which is defined by the product of two dipole operators , and @xmath27 is the core - hole broadening @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] . to be specific , we concentrate on iridates ( cuprates ) in the following symmetry analysis , in which the ir@xmath41 ( cu@xmath42 ) ions are in a @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) configuration . due to the strong spin - orbit coupling , ir@xmath41 ions in iridate form effective @xmath45 moments  @xcite so that the single - site ground - state multiplet is a kramers doublet , which we denote by @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> also in the case of cu@xmath42 in cuprates , a kramers doublet ( @xmath47 ) is the ground state as the tetragonal crystal field splits up the @xmath48 orbital degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> when one considers two of these moments , the magnetic interactions between them cause a splitting into a total singlet ( @xmath49 ) and a total triplet ( @xmath50 ) state . </S>",

    "<S> we denote such a charge - transfer state with a hole on oxygen as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents the ir @xmath59 ( cu @xmath60 ) state , in which all doublet states are occupied , and @xmath61 refers to the @xmath6-hole state of o.    we now introduce two different inversion symmetry operators @xmath62 and @xmath63 that represent inversion with respect to o and tm centers , respectively . when @xmath64 and @xmath63 are applied , local coordinates transform as @xmath65 and @xmath66 we note that @xmath63 is _ always _ a symmetry of the system , but @xmath62 is a symmetry operator _ only for @xmath67 _ , i.e. undistorted tm - o - tm bonds . because of @xmath63 symmetry , the hopping integrals between singlet / triplet and charge - transfer states obey the relations @xmath68 and @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the tm - o hopping part of the hamiltonian , so that the singlet ground state @xmath71 and triplet excites states @xmath72 become @xmath73 ) , triplet ( @xmath74 ) , and charge transfer ( @xmath57 ) states under two types of inversion , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . </S>",
