    "magnetite , fe@xmath1o@xmath2 , is the oldest magnetic material recognized 2500 years ago and is one of the most fascinating materials in present - day solid state physics .",
    "it is because fe@xmath1o@xmath2 exhibits many interesting physical properties @xcite such as mixed valence and a metal - insulator ( mi ) transition known as the verwey transition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fe@xmath1o@xmath2 has potential industrial applications in magnetic multilayer devices @xcite since it has full spin polarization with a high magnetic ordering temperature and its electronic structure at ambient conditions is predicted by band calculations to be half - metallic@xcite .    above the mi transition temperature , @xmath3 , fe@xmath1o@xmath2 has an inverse spinel structure with cubic symmetry where eight fe@xmath4 ions occupy the a sites with local tetragonal symmetry , while the b sites , which locally exhibit octahedral symmetry , are occupied by eight fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 ions in a simple ionic chemical formula .",
    "the results of resonant x - ray scattering @xcite show that the fe ions on the b sites are electronically equivalent for time scales lower than 10@xmath6 s. the mi transition occurs at @xmath3 @xmath7 120 k accompanied by a structural change where the conductivity decreases sharply by two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "early explanations of the mi transition invoked charge ordering on the fe b sites below @xmath3 . however , nmr relaxation results indicate that the states of fe ions on the b sites are mixed strongly even below @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent resonant x - ray and inelastic neutron scattering studies show a fractional charge ordering on the fe b sites below @xmath3 @xcite , which is predicted by band calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , some studies suggest that only the fe b sites are involved in the change in valence across the verwey transition @xcite while other investigations claim that the fe a sites play also an important role @xcite . therefore , despite continuing experimental and theoretical efforts in the last 70 years , many questions regarding the mi transition still remain open .",
    "magnetic compton scattering using synchrotron radiation is an established technique for probing the spin - uncompensated momentum density distribution in a material with spontaneous magnetization @xcite .",
    "the total electron momentum density , @xmath8 , is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 give the momentum densities of electrons in the majority and minority spin bands , respectively , and @xmath12 is the electron momentum .",
    "owing to the presence of spin - dependent terms in the scattering cross - section , the spin - uncompensated momentum density distribution , @xmath13 , can be measured using circularly polarized x - rays .",
    "it is obtained in the form of a projection of @xmath14 on the x - ray scattering vector , the so - called magnetic compton profile , defined as @xmath15 here the @xmath16-axis is taken to be parallel to the x - ray scattering vector and @xmath17 is the projection of @xmath12 on the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the integral of @xmath18 over @xmath17 yields the spin - magnetic moment of the material . for electronic structure studies in a material with spontaneous magnetization",
    ", a measurement of @xmath14 is very useful because @xmath14 reflects the spin polarization of occupied bands in momentum space .",
    "it is possible to image @xmath14 from a finite number of @xmath18s using a reconstruction technique .    in this work",
    "we report magnetic compton scattering studies of a single crystal of magnetite .",
    "the amplitude of the two - dimensional spin - uncompensated momentum density distribution is shown to develop negative excursions above the verwey temperature .",
    "we conclude on this basis that a substantial amount of @xmath19 minority electrons become itinerant on fe b sites above @xmath3 .",
    "a high - quality single crystal of fe@xmath1o@xmath2 was synthesized using the floating zone melting method .",
    "the crystal was annealed at around 1200 @xmath20c in the controlled atmosphere of a mixture of co and co@xmath21 in order to homogenize the composition of the specimen and to release internal strain .",
    "we used a disk - like single crystal sample of approximately 10 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness with its axis parallel to the cubic [ 101 ] axis .",
    "magnetic compton scattering experiments were carried out at 12 k and 300 k on beamline bl08w at spring-8 , japan .",
    "elliptically polarized x - rays emitted from an elliptical multipole wiggler were monochromatized to 174 kev by a bent si(620 ) crystal .",
    "energy spectra of compton scattered x - rays from the sample with a scattering angle of 178.0@xmath20 were measured using a 10-segmented ge solid - state detector with external magnetic field of 20 koe .",
    "the estimated momentum resolution is 0.50 @xmath22 0.01 a.u .",
    "full width at half - maximum .",
    "the directional @xmath18 is extracted from the difference between two spectra taken under the same experimental conditions with alternating directions of magnetization of the sample , aligned by an external magnetic field .",
    "the observed spectra were corrected for the energy - dependent scattering cross section , efficiency of the detector and absorption of the sample .",
    "since severe twinning occurs at @xmath3 in the single crystalline sample due to the structural change , de - twinning of the sample below @xmath3 was accomplished by simultaneous application of external magnetic field cooling and squeezing to extract directional magnetic profiles @xmath18 at 12 k. an external magnetic field of 20 koe was applied along the cubic [ 001 ] axis to establish the @xmath23-axis below @xmath3 .",
    "the use of a special cu sample holder enabled us to squeeze the sample along the cubic [ 11@xmath24 direction as a result of the larger cu thermal contraction .",
    "changes in the extracted @xmath18 at 12 k were observed below @xmath25 @xmath7 2 a.u .",
    "resulting from this mechanical de - twinning .",
    "thus the mechanical de - twinning is effective although we have not estimated the twin ratio in the sample at 12 k with and without mechanical de - twinning .",
    "figure 1 shows the extracted @xmath18 along the three cubic principal axes at 12 and 300 k. these profiles show a substantial directional dependence of the magnetic spin momentum density in good accord with the corresponding theoretical predictions discussed below .",
    "figure 2 shows the extracted @xmath18 at 12 k and 300 k between the cubic [ 001 ] and [ 101 ] axes .",
    "note that the dip in @xmath18 below @xmath17 @xmath7 1 a.u . observed from 9@xmath20 to 27@xmath20 at 300",
    "k disappears at 12 k. this result reveals that @xmath26 changes across @xmath3 even though the saturation magnetic moment changes by less than 0.1 % at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we have reconstructed the two - dimensional spin - uncompensated momentum density distribution , @xmath0 . for this purpose",
    ", we adopted the so - called direct fourier - transform method to reconstruct @xmath0 from several directional @xmath18s @xcite . in the reconstruction procedure , we assumed the cubic [ 010 ] axis to possess a four - fold rotational symmetry , even though fe@xmath1o@xmath2 at 12 k has a lower than cubic symmetry @xcite .",
    "this assumption was made as we measured @xmath18s only from the cubic [ 001 ] to the [ 101 ] axis due to the mechanical de - twinning using the special cu sample holder .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath0s are shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , which correspond to projections of @xmath26 on the cubic ( 010 ) plane . the reconstructed @xmath27 looks like a volcano at 12 and 300 k , where @xmath28 represents the projection of @xmath12 on the cubic ( 010 ) plane . at 300 k , the reconstructed @xmath27 in the crater region ( below @xmath29}|$ ] and @xmath30}|$ ] @xmath7 0.4 a.u . )",
    "is negative , while highly positive values are found in the region of @xmath31 @xmath7 1.7 a.u . with peaks at @xmath29}|$ ] = @xmath30}|$ ] @xmath7 1.2 a.u . , where @xmath32}$ ] and @xmath33}$ ] represent the components of @xmath12 along the cubic [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] axes , respectively .",

    "highly positive values in the reconstructed @xmath27 at 12 k appear in the region of @xmath31 @xmath7 1.6 a.u . with peaks at @xmath29}|$ ]",
    "= @xmath30}|$ ] @xmath7 1.1 a.u . ,",
    "similar to the situation at 300 k.",
    "in a 3@xmath34 transition metal compound with spontaneous magnetization , the spin - magnetic moment is the difference in occupancy between the majority and minority spin bands , which mostly have 3@xmath34 character .",
    "electrons in fully occupied majority and minority spin bands do not contribute to the spin - magnetic moment .",
    "however , at any point in momentum space spin components of these band electrons are not completely compensated because hybridization effects depend on the spin state of the band electrons .",
    "these uncompensated spin components contribute to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xmath26 is the spin - uncompensated component of all occupied band electrons and the area under @xmath18 is the spin - magnetic moment of the compound .",
    "fe@xmath1o@xmath2 is ferrimagnetic below 858 k where the magnetic moments of the fe a and b sites in the inverse spinel structure are antiparallel , resulting in a saturation magnetic moment of about 4 @xmath35/formula unit , which does not change drastically at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic electrons are mostly 3d electrons from the fe sites .",
    "consequently , the extracted difference in the reconstructed @xmath27 results from a change in the band electrons with mainly 3@xmath34 character .",
    "since the symmetry of fe@xmath1o@xmath2 above @xmath3 is cubic , the negative values below @xmath29}|$ ] and @xmath30}|$ ] @xmath7 0.4 a.u . in the reconstructed @xmath27 at 300 k stem from electrons in the minority spin bands below @xmath36 @xmath7 0.7 a.u . , a region in the first brillouin zone of the inverse spinel structure .",
    "accordingly , these electrons contribute to the electrical conductivity of fe@xmath1o@xmath2 because they have itinerant character .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath27 below @xmath29}|$ ] and @xmath30}|$ ] @xmath7 0.4 a.u .",
    "is positive at 12 k and the positive values in the reconstructed @xmath27 in the region of @xmath31 @xmath7 1.6 a.u at 12 k are smaller than those at 300 k. the population of electrons with itinerant character decreases discontinuously at @xmath3 reflecting the remarkable decrease in the conductivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observed difference in the reconstructed @xmath27 provides clear experimental evidence that electrons with @xmath36 @xmath37 0.7 a.u . in the minority spin bands",
    "are localized below @xmath3 and that the electronic structure of fe@xmath1o@xmath2 with the inverse spinel structure is half - metallic in character .",
    "the mi transition is characterized by the localization of the electrons in the minority spin bands which contribute to the spin magnetic moment of fe@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this mi transition with the structural change does not strongly affect the electrons with high momenta , which have a localized character even at 300 k. these results are consistent with a small change in the saturation magnetic moments at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the reconstructed @xmath27 at 12 k can not be understood using the simple ionic model with the inverse or normal spinel structure .",
    "we have evaluated the number of electrons , @xmath38 , whose wave functions localize from the positive region in the difference of reconstructed @xmath27 between 12 k and 300 k. the value of @xmath38 is found to be 0.590(2 ) per unit cell ( containing two fe b sites ) and should be compared to the charge ordering on the iron b sites of about 0.4 electrons per unit cell @xcite .",
    "the higher value of @xmath38 indicates that the iron - oxygen hybridization plays also a role in the mi transition .",
    "we have carried out kkr band structure and momentum density calculations on fe@xmath1o@xmath2 in the inverse spinel structure within the framework of the local density approximation ( lda ) in order to gain insight into the nature of @xmath0 @xcite . a reasonable level of agreement is seen in fig . 1 between the computed @xmath18 and the measured spectra at 300 k along the three cubic axes , especially above @xmath17 @xmath7 2 a.u . figure 3(c )",
    "shows the theoretical @xmath0 after it has been broadened to account for experimental resolution .",
    "the features of the calculated @xmath27 look similar to those of the reconstructed @xmath27 at 300 k. however , in contrast with the experimental spectrum , the positive peaks at @xmath29}|$ ] = @xmath30}|$ ] @xmath7 1.2 a.u .",
    "in @xmath0 are sharper in the calculations and the value of the calculated @xmath0 at @xmath31 @xmath7 0 is almost zero .",
    "these discrepancies can not be understood within the ionic picture , but could arise from exaggerated hybridization in the lda and/or correlation effects missing in our lda - based calculations . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , our computed spectrum before it is convoluted with the experimental resolution does display a negative value of the spin momentum density in the first brillouin zone due to the presence of minority @xmath19 itinerant electrons appearing above @xmath3 , but this negative excursion is smeared out by the effect of resolution broadening . the observed deeper crater - like feature in the reconstructed @xmath27",
    "could be explained by the partial occupation of @xmath39 orbitals reflecting correlation effects beyond the lda , since the majority spin @xmath39 orbitals give a positive contribution to @xmath27 at @xmath31 @xmath7 0 .",
    "correlation effects are known to produce partial occupation of the natural orbitals and smearing of the electron momentum density @xcite .",
    "we have carried out magnetic compton scattering experiments to investigate the spin - uncompensated electron momentum density @xmath26 of fe@xmath1o@xmath2 at 12 k and 300 k. mechanical de - twinning was used to overcome severe twinning in the single crystal sample below @xmath3 .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath27 below @xmath29}|$ ] and @xmath30}|$ ] @xmath7 0.4 a.u .",
    "changes from being negative at 300 k to positive at 12 k. this result reveals that electrons in the minority spin bands with @xmath36 @xmath37 0.7 a.u . are localized below @xmath3 , while electrons with high momenta , which have a localized character at 300 k , are not affected strongly by the mi transition .",
    "interestingly , the observed behavior of the reconstructed @xmath27 at 12 k can not be understood within the simple ionic model or the standard lda - based band theory picture , and indicates the presence of correlation effects beyond the lda leading to particularly strong smearing of the spin - uncompensated momentum density distribution .",
    "the experiments were performed at spring-8 with the approval of the japan synchrotron radiation research institute ( jasri ) under proposal numbers 2002b0381-nd3-np and 2003a0308-nd3-np .",
