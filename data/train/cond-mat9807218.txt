    "<S> we study a highly supercooled two - dimensional fluid mixture via molecular dynamics simulation . </S>",
    "<S> we follow bond breakage events among particle pairs , which occur on the scale of the @xmath0 relaxation time @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> large scale heterogeneities analogous to the critical fluctuations in ising systems are found in the spatial distribution of bonds which are broken in a time interval with a width of order @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the structure factor of the broken bond density is well approximated by the ornstein - zernike form . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation length is of order @xmath3 at the lowest temperature studied , @xmath4 being the particle size . </S>",
    "<S> the weakly bonded regions thus identified evolve in time with strong spatial correlations .    2    </S>",
    "<S> as fluids are supercooled below their melting temperature , their structural relaxations become very slow , resulting in a glass transition at @xmath5 characterized by a dramatic increase of the viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite recently much attention has been paid to the mode coupling theory , @xcite which is a self - consistent decoupling scheme for the density time correlation function and describes onset of glassy slowing down or slow structural relaxations considerably above @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant fluctuation contribution arises from the first peak wave number of the structure factor . for a long time </S>",
    "<S> , however , it has been intuitively expected @xcite that dynamics in glasses should be cooperative , involving many molecules , owing to configuration restrictions . </S>",
    "<S> adam and gibbs @xcite speculated that particle motions over the interparticle distance or the potential barrier can take place only collectively in _ cooperatively rearranging regions _ </S>",
    "<S> ( crr ) and such regions have a minimum size which grows as the temperature is lowered . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the mode coupling theory does not predict long range correlations .    in his recent experiments fischer </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has reported large excess light scattering with a correlation length @xmath7 ( @xmath8 nm ) which increases on approaching the glass transition from a liquid state . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the presence of large scale heterogeneities in supercooled liquids . to examine this effect , </S>",
    "<S> some authors used monte carlo simulations on a dense polymer melt . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite there , significant dependence of the diffusion constant on the system size was found , indicating correlations up to the system size . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite very recently , weber _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_@xcite have found that short range nematic orientational order produces enhancement of long range density correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the work of weber _ et al _ suggests that large scale density heterogeneities will not be produced in simple molecular systems .    in their md simulation on a simple two - dimensional fluid in a deeply supercooled state , muranaka and hiwatari </S>",
    "<S> @xcite visualized significant large scale heterogeneities in particle displacements in a relatively short time interval which corresponds to the so - called @xmath9 relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> in liquid states with higher temperatures , hurley and harrowell @xcite observed similar kinetic heterogeneities but the correlation length was still on the order of a few particle diameters . </S>",
    "<S> the characterization of these patterns has not been made in these papers .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a natural expectation that structural changes of the configurations of particles occur collectively @xcite , but it is rather surprising that the visualization of such long range correlations has been nonexistent in the structural or @xmath0 relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the aims here are to visualize them unambiguously and analyze the patterns qualitatively .    </S>",
    "<S> our system is composed of two different atomic species , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with the numbers @xmath12 , interacting via the soft - core potential @xmath13^{12}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the distance between two particles and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we take the size and mass ratios as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the particle sizes prevents crystallization . </S>",
    "<S> there is no enhancement of the composition fluctuations at any wave number and the system is effectively one - component . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is truncated at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the leapfrog algorithm@xcite is adopted to solve the differential equations with a time step of @xmath19 under the periodic boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the space and time are measured in units of @xmath4 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature is kept at a constant value using the gaussian constraint thermostat,@xcite and the density is fixed at @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we specify the thermodynamic states using the coupling parameter @xmath22 , @xcite where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the compositions and are equal to @xmath25 in our case , so it follows that @xmath26 data are taken at @xmath27 and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding temperature is @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , in units of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding pressure is @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , in units of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we realized these states by cooling the system very slowly in a stepwise manner from a liquid state with @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the equilibration time is @xmath36 after @xmath37 is changed from @xmath38 to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> there was no appreciable change in the pressure over computation times of order @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - shear viscosity @xmath40 is of order @xmath41 at @xmath42 and @xmath43 at @xmath44 in units of @xmath45 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was claimed that glassy behavior becomes apparent for @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in our analysis we follow bond breakage processes . for each atomic configuration given at time @xmath47 , a pair of atoms @xmath48 and @xmath49 is considered to be bonded if @xmath50 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 belong to the species @xmath0 and @xmath9 , respectively , and @xmath51 . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the particle density is so high that the pair distribution functions @xmath52 have a sharp peak at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the definition of bonds is very insensitive to the factor in front of @xmath54 as long as it is slightly larger than 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the polygons , which are composed of the bonds and cover the space , are mostly triangles as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . after a lapse of time @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> we count the number @xmath56 of surviving bonds which continue to satisfy @xmath57 if the initially bonded pair does not satisfy ( 2 ) , we regard it to have been broken . </S>",
    "<S> this definition of bond breakage is also insensitive to the factor in front of @xmath54 as long as it is considerably larger than 1 and smaller than 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we have confirmed that @xmath56 decays exponentially as @xmath58 this holds excellently in the whole time region for @xmath59 , but has been obtained from the fit in the short time region @xmath60 for @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we have not yet checked whether or not @xmath56 relaxes exponentially for @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> note that there are three kinds of bonds in our two - component fluid , but no significant differences can be found in their breakage processes . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we show that the bond breakage time @xmath63 grows strongly with increasing @xmath37 . our data may be well fitted to @xmath64 as well as to @xmath65 . because @xmath66 is the relaxation time of the glassy structures , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath66 should be of the same order as the @xmath0 relaxation time @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact for the same model muranaka and hiwatari @xcite obtained @xmath1 on the same order as our @xmath66 from the self part of the time correlation function @xmath67 at @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this coincidence is natural because @xmath67 at @xmath68 decays when a tagged particle moves over the interparticle distance .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 displays the bonds broken within the time interval @xmath69 $ ] at @xmath70 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the center positions @xmath71 at the initial time @xmath72 of the pairs broken within the time interval are depicted here . </S>",
    "<S> for the glassy case @xmath73 , the broken bond distribution is markedly heterogeneous , being composed of clusters with various sizes , whereas for the liquid case @xmath42 , the inhomogeneity is much weaker . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in the bond breakage we observe strings of broken bonds involving several particles even in liquid states , because of the high density of our system , and their large - scale aggregation in glassy states . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the heterogeneities is ascribed to the fact that particle motions over the interparticle distance can occur only collectively in glassy states . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite furthermore , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the broken bonds in two consecutive time intervals , @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] , at @xmath44 . the initial times at which the bonds are defined are @xmath72 and @xmath75 for the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that the clusters of broken bonds in the two time intervals mostly overlap or are adjacent to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this means that _ weakly bonded regions _ or _ relatively active regions _ migrate in space on the time scale of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 relaxation ends when most of the bonds are broken .    </S>",
    "<S> we next calculated the structure factor @xmath76 of the broken bond density @xmath77 defined by @xmath78 the summation is over the broken pairs , @xmath79 is the total number of the broken bonds , and @xmath80 is the angular average over the direction of the wave vector @xmath81 where @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the system length @xmath83 is @xmath84 here . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since @xmath76 from one configuration fluctuates at small @xmath85 , we have taken the averages of @xmath76 from 10 sequential configurations for @xmath86 and 4 sequential configurations for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> then , as shown in fig.5 , @xmath76 can be well approximated by the simple ornstein - zernike form , @xmath87 ,   \\label{5}\\ ] ] from which we can determine @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the raw @xmath76 from ( 4 ) tends to become 1 at large @xmath85 , so it has been subtracted in @xmath76 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this subtracted value is negligibly small for @xmath88 at long wavelengths @xmath89 , however . ) </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath90 and the large @xmath85 behavior of @xmath76 is insensitive to @xmath37 as in ising spin systems near the critical point . in fig.6 </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath7 vs @xmath91 for the two widths of the time intervals , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that @xmath7 is largely independent of the width except for the lowest temperature case , where @xmath44 . in this case , however , @xmath7 approaches the system length @xmath96 and a finite size effect should be present . </S>",
    "<S> also @xmath66 at the lowest @xmath97 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 seems to be affected by the same effect .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 3 - 5 suggest that the cluster structure in the highly supercooled states comprises clusters with various length scales , the minimum being @xmath4 and the maximum being @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it appears to be self - similar if we consider clusters with size @xmath98 in the region @xmath99 in the limit @xmath100 , which is also supported by the power law behavior @xmath101 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . this apparently contradicts adam - gibbs phenomenological speculation in which the _ minimum _ size of crr grows upon cooling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the heterogeneities are of purely kinetic origin and are dynamical objects . indeed , the small clusters with @xmath102 in figs . 3 and 4 evolve into larger ones or dissolve in the subsequent time intervals .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also calculated the structure factors of the density , composition and stress tensor , but no indication of large scale heterogeneities has been detected in such static quantities in accordance with previous papers.@xcite the kinetic heterogeneities found in this paper play a crucial role in response to externally applied perturbations such as sound waves or shear flow . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    a frequently disputed issue in the literature is whether or not there is an underlying thermodynamic phase transition at a nonzero temperature @xmath103 below @xmath6 in highly supercooled liquids . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 does not indicate any divergence of @xmath7 at a nonzero temperature , although this is not conclusive due to the finite size effect arising from @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> we mention a recent simulation on a three - dimensional lennard - jones mixture by ghosh and dasgupta , @xcite who used scaling relations of finite systems to conclude @xmath105 as @xmath106 without examining cluster structures . </S>",
    "<S> the limited data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 also yield @xmath107 .    in summary , by performing long time and large scale md simulations on a 2d soft - core mixture </S>",
    "<S> , we have examined bond breakage events to find large - scale heterogeneities in the changing rates of the amorphous structure , which are enhanced at low temperatures and surprisingly similar to the critical fluctuations in ising systems . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is a first step in the investigation of more complex situations and 3d cases . </S>",
    "<S> we should also clarify the relationship of our patterns in the @xmath0 relaxation and those by muranaka and hiwatari @xcite in the @xmath9 relaxation .    </S>",
