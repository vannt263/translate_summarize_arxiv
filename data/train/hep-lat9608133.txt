    "abelian projected qcd has been studied extensively in recent years , for elucidating the mechanism of quark confinement @xcite .",
    "the abelian projection of qcd@xcite is to perform a partial gauge - fixing such that the maximal abelian torus group remains unbroken .",
    "abelian monopoles appear as a topological quantity in such a partial gauge fixing , so that qcd can be regarded as an abelian theory with electric charges and monopoles .",
    "t hooft conjectured that if the monopoles made bose condensation , quarks could be confined due to dual meissner effect@xcite .",
    "there are some evidences on lattices that the abelian theory in the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge@xcite well represents the long range properties of qcd :    1 .",

    "the argument of the energy and the entropy indicates that qcd is in the monopole condensed phase@xcite .",

    "it is interesting to study what exponents are calculated from the abelian and the monopole polyakov loops at each critical point , since @xmath4 symmetry is not so directly understood in the framwork of monopole dynamics@xcite and there is no reason the exponents of those different polyakov loops agree with each other .",

    "[ crexp ] .",
