    "nanofluids are suspensions of nanometer - sized solid particles and fibers , which have recently become a subject of growing scientific interest because of reports of greatly enhanced thermal properties @xcite .",
    "filler dispersed in a nanofluid is typically of nanometer size , and it has been shown that such nanoparticles dispersed in a base fluid are able to endow it with a much higher effective thermal conductivity than pure fluid @xcite : significantly higher than those of commercial coolants such as water and ethylene glycol .",
    "in addition , nanofluids show an enhanced thermal conductivity compared to theoretical predictions based on the maxwell equation for a well - dispersed particulate composite model .",
    "these features are highly desirable for applications , and nanofluids may be a strong candidate for new generation of coolants @xcite . the use of nanofluids in many industrial sectors , including energy supply and production , transportation and electronics appears promising .",
    "a review about experimental and theoretical results on the mechanism of heat transfer in nanofluids can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where authors discuss issues related to the technology of nanofluid production , experimental equipment , and features of measurement methods .",
    "a large degree of randomness and scatter has been observed in the experimental data published in the open literature .",
    "given the inconsistency in these data , it is impossible to develop a comprehensive physical - based model that can predict all the trends .",
    "this also points out the need for a systematic approach in both experimental and theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "in particular , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have attracted great interest for nanofluid applications , because of the claims about their exceptionally high thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental findings about cnts report an anomalously wide range of enhancement values that continue to perplex the research community and remain unexplained @xcite . for example",
    ", some experimental studies showed that there is a modest improvement in thermal conductivity of water at a high loading of multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mw - cnts ) , @xmath235% increase for a 1 wt% mwnt nanofluid @xcite .",
    "these authors attribute the increase to the formation of a nanotube network with a higher thermal conductivity . on the contrary , at low nanotube content , @xmath30.03 wt% , they observed a decrease in thermal conductivity upon an increase of nanotube concentration . on the other hand",
    ", more recent experimental investigations showed that the enhancement of thermal conductivity as compared to water is varying linearly when mw - cnt weight content is increasing from 0.01 to 3 wt% . for a mwnt weight content of 3 wt% the enhancement of thermal conductivity reaches 64% of the base fluid ( e.g. water ) .",
    "the average length of the nanotubes appears to be a very sensitive parameter .",
    "the enhancement of thermal conductivity compared to water alone is enhanced when nanotube average length is increasing in the 0.5 - 5 @xmath4 m range @xcite .    clearly , there are difficulties in the experimental measurements @xcite , but the previous results also reveal some underlaying technological problems .",
    "first of all , the cnts show some bundling or the formation of aggregates originating from the fabrication step .",
    "moreover it seems reasonable that cnts encounter poor dispersibility and suspension durability due to the aggregation and surface hydrophobicity of cnts as a nanofluid filler .",
    "therefore , the surface modification of cnts or additional chemicals ( surfactants ) have been required for stable suspensions of cnts , because the base fluid for the coolant has polar characteristics . in the case of surface modification of cnts ,",
    "water - dispersible cnts have been extensively investigated for potential applications , such as biological uses , nanodevices , novel precursors for chemical reagents , and nanofluids @xcite . a popular solution for increasing dispersion of cnts",
    "is based on functionalization .",
    "oxygen - containing functional groups have been introduced on the cnt surfaces and more hydrophilic surfaces have been formed during this treatment , which enabled to make stable and homogeneous cnt nanofluids @xcite .",
    "alternative solutions relay on ultrasonic disrupting , which significantly decreases the size of agglomerated particles and number of primary particles in a particle cluster , such that thermal conductivity increases with the elapsed ultrasonication time @xcite . in any case , it is clear that many parameters affect the thermal conductivity including size , shape and source of nanotubes , surfactants , power of ultrasonic , time of ultrasonication , elapsed time after ultrasonication , ph , temperature , particle concentration and surfactant concentration @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a lot of room for technological optimization .    in the above brief review ,",
    "only the free suspensions of cnts have been considered , i.e. nanofluids were the highly thermally conductive filler is free to move .",
    "in fact , beyond the favorable aspect ratio , the cnts dispersed in nanofluids lead to enhanced thermal conductivity , which can not be explained by traditional conductivity theories such as the maxwell s mixing theory or other macroscale approaches .",
    "recently , jang & choi @xcite have found that the brownian motion of nanoparticles at the molecular and nanoscale level is a key mechanism governing the thermal behavior of nanoparticle - fluid suspensions .",
    "they have devised a theoretical model that accounts for the fundamental role of dynamic nanoparticles in nanofluids .",
    "essentially , these authors discovered a fundamental difference between solid / solid composites and solid / liquid suspensions in size - dependent conductivity . in the original reference @xcite",
    ", they claim that , even though the random motion of nanoparticles is characterized by zero time average , the vigorous and relentless interactions between liquid molecules and nanoparticles at the molecular and nanoscale level translate into conduction at the macroscopic level , because there is no bulk flow .",
    "however there is another way to exploit the concept of nanofluids , i.e. to modify the base fluid properties by nanostructures . essentially one promising way consists in fixing the relative position of the cnts on nanoengineered surfaces",
    "this means moving from _ nanotubes _ ( where the focus is on the shape of the nanostructure ) to _ nanofins _ ( where the focus is on the function of the nanostructure ) . in this way , the brownian motion of nanoparticles is gone , but there is still the possibility to enhance the heat transfer by increasing the effective cooling surface area .",
    "the fundamental technological advantage is that the dispersion of cnts is controlled by design and only limited by the manufacturing process .",
    "nowadays efficient cooling of silicon chips using microfin structures made of aligned mw - cnt arrays has been achieved @xcite .",
    "the tiny cooling elements mounted on the back side of the chips enable power dissipation from the heated chips on the level of modern electronic devices demands .",
    "nanotubes utilized as thermal fins ( nanofins ) are mechanically superior compared to other materials being ten times lighter , flexible , and stiff at the same time @xcite .",
    "nanofins are extensively investigated also from a modeling standpoint @xcite .",
    "the current challenge is to develop industrial manufacturing processes for macroscopic growth of carbon nanotube mats @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims to investigate by molecular mechanics based on force fields ( mmff ) the thermal performance of nanofins made of single wall cnts ( sw - cnts ) cooled by water .",
    "this work focuses on the astonishing thermal properties of these nanostructures , in particular , when they interact with the surrounding base fluid .",
    "the single wall cnts were selected mainly on the basis of time constraints due to our parallel computational facilities .",
    "the following analysis can be split into two parts .",
    "first of all , the heat conductivity of sw - cnts is estimated numerically by both simplified model ( section 1 , where this approach is proved to be inadequate ) and detailed three - dimensional model ( section 2 ) .",
    "this first step is required for tuning the numerical model and validate the vacuum results with literature results .",
    "next , the thermal boundary conductance between sw - cnt and water is computed by two methods : the steady state method ( section 3.1 ) , mimicking ideal cooling due to strong brownian motion , and transient method ( section 3.2 ) , taking into account only weak brownian motion .",
    "in order to significantly downgrade the difficulty of studying energy transport processes within a carbon nanotube , authors often resort to simplified low dimensional systems such as one - dimensional lattices @xcite .",
    "in particular , heat transfer in a lattice is typically modeled by the vibrations of lattice particles interacting with the nearest neighbors and by a coupling with thermostats at different temperatures .",
    "the latter are the popular _ numerical experiments _ based on non - equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) . in this respect , to the end of measuring the thermal conductivity of ( @xmath5 ) single wall nanotubes ( swnt ) , we set up a model for solving the equations of motion of the particle chain pictorially reported in fig . 1 where each particle represents a ring with 10 atoms in the real nanotube . in the present model ,",

    "<S> , nanofluids are studied in the sense of nanofins transversally attached to a surface , so that dispersion within a fluid is mainly dictated by design and manufacturing processes . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on single carbon nanotubes thought as nanofins to enhance heat transfer between a surface and a fluid in contact with it . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we first investigate the thermal conductivity of those nanostructures by means of classical non - equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> next , thermal conductance at the interface between a single wall carbon nanotube ( nanofin ) and water molecules is assessed by means of both steady - state and transient numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> numerical evidences suggest a pretty favorable thermal boundary conductance ( order of @xmath0 @xmath1 $ ] ) which makes carbon nanotubes ideal candidates for constructing nanofinned surfaces . </S>"
