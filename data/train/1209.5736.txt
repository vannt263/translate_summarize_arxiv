    "<S> the overall performance of the whole procedure can be quantified by the average of a figure of merit ( typically the fidelity ) over some a priori distribution of the parameters and over all possible outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> phase estimation with pure states of  @xmath0 qubits is a paradigmatic example of this endeavor and will serve as the main exemplification of our findings . in standard parameter estimation protocols   </S>",
    "<S> the experimentalist is expected to produce a conclusive answer ( maybe not right or accurate enough ) , at each run of the experiment . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that there are situations where the ultimate precision of the standard approach can be improved substantially if one allows for a number of inconclusive responses , where the metrologist abstains from producing a guess . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially relevant in situations where she can afford to re - run the experiment ( i.e. she can easily prepare a new instance of the problem ) or where she prioritises having high - quality estimates . </S>",
    "<S> abstention has already been used in the context of state discrimination  @xcite , where some fixed rate  @xmath1 of inconclusive outcomes can lower the probability of error significantly ( even down to zero , as in unambiguous discrimination  @xcite ) and can be seen as a particular example of post - selection  @xcite .    in the estimation framework </S>",
    "<S> the effects of abstention have hardly been considered . in the cases studied so far in the literature  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , abstention has limited impact for large samples unless the experimentalist refrains from producing an estimate most of the time . here </S>",

    "<S> can be tackled in the same way ( results will be given elsewhere  @xcite ) .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we also present a very general technique to obtain the asymptotic form of pure - state parameter estimation problems , with or without abstention . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea is that the components of the probe state can be viewed as a discretization of some continuous function @xmath2 on the unit interval @xmath3 $ ] , and the maximization of the fidelity as a constrained variational problem defined by a suitable action for @xmath2 , from which the solution can be worked out analytically in many physically relevant situations . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth mentioning that even in the standard approach to estimation ( without abstention ) analytical asymptotic expressions were known in just a few cases .    in phase estimation , </S>",
    "<S> one aims to optimally estimate the parameter @xmath4 of the covariant family of states  , where  @xmath5  stands for the unitary transformation  @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a normalized fiducial state that in the eigenbasis of @xmath5 can be written as @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity between the true phase @xmath4 and its estimate  @xmath9 can be written as  , where @xmath10 is a subscript specifying that the estimate is based on the outcome  @xmath10 of a generalized measurement . </S>",
    "<S> this is characterized mathematically by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 outputs a conclusive answer ( from which an estimate is proposed ) and @xmath14 outputs ` abstention ' . </S>",
    "<S> the probability of abstention taking place is @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the acceptance probability ( rate at which we provide definite estimates ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average fidelity for this rate of abstention is @xmath17 estimation with abstention can be reduced to a standard estimation problem by simply introducing the new povm @xmath18 , with elements given by @xmath19 , and the new family of ( normalized ) states </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20    this formulation brings forward an interpretation of the role of abstention here : each initial state @xmath21 is transformed into a new @xmath22 that ` encodes ' the unknown parameter @xmath4 in a more efficient way . </S>",
    "<S> this map improves the estimation precision by effectively increasing the distinguishability between the signal states , therefore it can only be implemented in a probabilistic fashion ( it succeeds with probability  @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this stochastic map is fully specified by the optimal choice of @xmath24 , i.e. , the one that maximizes  . </S>",
    "<S> although this may seem a difficult optimization problem , a huge simplification arises because of the covariance of the family of states . already from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ def q ] ) and one can easily see that the optimal povm can be chosen to be covariant under the set of unitaries  @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> hereafter it is assumed that the states have non - negative coefficients @xmath34 ( and hence @xmath35 ) , for any phases present in the coefficients @xmath36 ( or  @xmath37 ) can be absorbed by the above povm elements . with this , the calculation of the fidelity simplifies to @xmath38 where in the eigenbasis of @xmath5 the matrix of  @xmath39 is real and tridiagonal , with elements @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximization over  @xmath41 in  ( [ fidelity - general-3 ] ) can be turned into a maximization over the transformed states ,  , subject to the constraints @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the maximum fidelity for a given rate of abstention  @xmath1 is  @xmath45 .    for large enough abstention rates the inequality constraint has no effect ( provided @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 becomes the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath49 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath50 is the maximum fidelity that can be achieved by optimizing the components of the fiducial state ; these are given by the corresponding eigenvector  @xmath51 of  @xmath49 @xcite . from the inequality constraint </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the critical acceptance rate @xmath52 . </S>",

    "<S> when no abstention is allowed , no maximization is possible , hence @xmath54 and  . for intermediate values of @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> the calculation becomes more tricky . for moderate values of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> it can be easily cast as a semidefinite programming ( sdp ) problem ( see supplemental material ) , and hence solved efficiently to arbitrary accuracy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the main focus of this work is on asymptotics ( large @xmath0 regime ) and in particular on presenting an approach that enables obtaining analytical asymptotic expressions . with this aim , </S>",
