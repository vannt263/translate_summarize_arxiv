    "one of the least expected achievements of the infra - red astronomical satellite ( iras ; neugebauer et al .",
    "1984 ) was the detection of a large number of mid - ir point sources in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) just above its limits of sensitivity ( iras point source catalogue ; schwering & israel 1990 ) .",
    "many of these are candidates for intermediate - mass stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "their lives drawing to a close , these stars are shedding their stellar mantles at rates of up to @xmath1 m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 .",
    "their dusty circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) obscure the optical light from the star and become very bright ir objects .",
    "the details of the evolution and mass loss of agb stars are poorly understood .",
    "the study of galactic samples of agb stars is severely hampered by the difficulty to determine accurate distances to stars in the milky way .",
    "the distance to the lmc , however , is well known and hence luminosities and mass - loss rates of agb stars in the lmc may be determined with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "early explorations of the iras data in combination with ground - based near - ir observations resulted in the first identifications of mid - ir sources in the lmc with obscured agb stars ( reid et al .",
    "1990 ; wood et al .",
    "we have successfully increased the sample of known agb counterparts of iras sources in the lmc from a dozen to more than 50 stars ( loup et al .",
    "1997 ; zijlstra et al .  1996",
    "; van loon et al .",
    "1997 , 1998a : papers i to iv ) .",
    "we attempted to classify their photospheres and cses as oxygen- or carbon - dominated , but for the majority of the stars this could not be done conclusively .",
    "there remained therefore considerable uncertainty about the luminosity distribution of the obscured carbon stars .",
    "this information is important for testing current understanding of the evolution of agb stars , including dredge - up of carbon and nuclear burning at the bottom of the convective mantle ( hot bottom burning , hbb ) .",

    "<S> phot - p and phot - c photometry at 12 , 25 and 60 @xmath0 m and cam photometry at 12 @xmath0 m are used in combination with quasi - simultaneous ground - based near - ir photometry to construct colour - colour diagrams for all stars in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> phot - s and cam - cvf spectra in the 3 to 14 @xmath0 m region are presented for 23 stars . from the colour - colour diagrams and the spectra </S>",
