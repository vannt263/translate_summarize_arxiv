    "it helps explain why benefits of entanglement may survive entanglement - breaking noise ; and complements the recent interpretations of discord as a physical resource establishing its crucial role in quantum technology .    for simplicity , in our paper",

    "the performance advantage of quantum illumination @xmath55 still satisfies the equality @xmath79 in this completely general case .",
    "thanks to this versatility , our result can be applied to many variants of the orginal quantum illumination protocol .",
    "for instance , a prominent candidate is the adoption of quantum illumination as a cryptographic communication protocol  @xcite . in such a variant",
    ", one assumes that bob lives in the region of intense noise , and uses the reflector to distribute a secret - key with alice .",
    "more generally , this could be achieved by the application of appropriate unitaries , as in the original cryptographic protocols based on two - way quantum communication  @xcite .",
    "the application of our techniques would then connect the improved security of these protocols with the discord which is employed to encode the secret information .    in general ,",
    "quantum illumination is one among a broad collection of protocols aimed at determining certain properties of unknown quantum channels .",
    "there is quantum channel discrimination  @xcite , where a discrete set of channels encodes a multivariate random variable , to be retrieved by optimizing input probes and output detections .",
    "a simple example is the binary case of quantum loss detection , where one has to determine if a quantum channel is lossy or not .",

    "both measures carry operational meaning . in gambling scenarios where alice bets double or nothing on @xmath2 , for example ,",
    "the probability of success measures the chance that alice wins each round ; whereas the amount of information alice gains about @xmath2 dictates alice s expected earnings using kelly s optimal betting strategy  @xcite .",

    "* outline of the proof . *",
    "the key idea behind our proof is to first impose an additional restriction on the quantum illumination protocol . in standard quantum illumination",
    ", alice could use arbitrary measurements to distinguish between @xmath30_{ab}$ ] and @xmath97 . here , we impose a specific measurement procedure .",
    "alice is required to first make a local measurement on the idler @xmath19 , followed by a local measurement on the signal @xmath18 .",
    "this naturally restricts the amount of information she can access about @xmath33 to some maximal value @xmath98 .",
    "we then establish that :    * the optimal performance of quantum illumination , subject to this restriction , coincides with the best performance using conventional illumination @xmath99 . * the loss in performance in using this third approach over quantum illumination is @xmath100 .",
    "* proof of statement ( i ) . *",
    "recall that in the conventional approach , alice probes for the reflecting object with a pure qudit state @xmath7 .",
    "the target - variable @xmath33 is then mapped into the output codewords @xmath101_c = \\eta \\phi+ ( 1 - \\eta ) \\rho_e , \\qquad { \\rho^{(#1)}}_c = \\rho_e,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , with @xmath11 being the identity operator . since these codewords commute , their shannon distinguishability is equal to the holevo information , i.e. , we have @xmath102_c,{\\rho^{(#1)}}_c ) = \\chi(\\rhocode[0]_c,{\\rho^{(#1)}}_c),\\ ] ] where @xmath103_c,{\\rho^{(#1)}}_c):= s(\\bar{\\rho_c } ) -\\sum_x p_x s[\\rho_c^{(x)}],\\ ] ] with @xmath104 being the average output state , and @xmath93 the von neumann entropy .",
    "the optimal conventional performance is given by the optimization @xmath105 over all possible pure states @xmath9 .",
    "note that we are restricting such an optimization to pure states , since mixed states surely provide worse performance .",
    "this can be explicitly proven by _",
    "reductio ad absurdum_. assume that there exists some mixed state @xmath106 such that @xmath107 for all pure @xmath9 .",
    "then , let @xmath108 be a purification of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denotes a reference system . if we had access to @xmath110 , we can measure it in the @xmath111 basis .",
    "this would collapse the probe state to @xmath112 with probability @xmath113 , resulting in an average performance of @xmath114 . in comparison ,",
    "if the measurement result was lost , our performance would reduce to @xmath115 .",
    "clearly , since performance can only degrade upon loss of information @xmath116 therefore , there is a pure state @xmath117 for some @xmath118 such that @xmath119 , which contradicts our initial assumption .",
    "hence @xmath120 must attain its maximum on a pure state .",
    "it is now important to note that , since @xmath13 is completely mixed , symmetry considerations imply that @xmath121 is the same for any pure state @xmath9 , i.e. , all pure probes deliver equal performance , and this performance coincides with the best possible performance of conventional illumination @xmath76 .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the invariance of the holevo information under unitaries .",
    "in fact , let us apply an arbitrary unitary @xmath122 to the codewords @xmath123 just before detection .",
    "since @xmath13 is proportional to the identity , we have @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "these two codewords can equivalently be generated if we had started from the input state @xmath126 , which spans all the hilbert space by varying @xmath122 . at the same time , we note that the holevo information does not change , i.e. , for any @xmath122 we have @xmath127_c,{\\rho^{(#1)}}_c)= i_c ( \\phi).\\ ] ] thus , find that @xmath128 for an arbitrary pure state @xmath9 .    to demonstrate that the optimal conventional performance @xmath76 coincides with @xmath98 , we observe that all operations in the quantum illumination circuit commutes with a local measurement on the idler system @xmath19 .",
    "thus , there is no functional difference between measuring the idler beam after receipt of the reflected signal and measuring the same idler beam prior to sending out the signal .",
    "then , suppose that alice detects the idler system before transmission , by applying a rank-1 povm @xmath48 on the @xmath19-part of the maximally entangled state @xmath38 .",
    "given an outcome @xmath52 , with probability @xmath129 , the signal system @xmath18 is collapsed into a conditional pure state @xmath130 ( this because rank-1 povms project pure states into pure states ) . sending any pure probe",
    "@xmath131 attains the maximum conventional performance @xmath132 . on average , the performance of alice is therefore given by @xmath133    * proof of statement ( ii ) . *",
    "suppose that alice performs the quantum illumination protocol by probing the target with the @xmath18-part of a maximally entangled state @xmath38 .",
    "the target - variable @xmath134 is then mapped into the codewords @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "let @xmath137 be the maximum amount of information that alice retrieves about the target - variable @xmath33 using arbitrary quantum measurements .",
    "it is easy to check that , for @xmath38 maximally - entangled and @xmath13 maximally - mixed , the two codewords commute @xmath138=0 $ ] , so that their shannon distinguishability is equal to the holevo information , i.e. , @xmath139,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 and @xmath141 .    as before ,",

    "since these spectra do not depend on the pure state @xmath131 , they are identical for any measurement operator @xmath160 of any rank-1 povm @xmath48 . as a result",

    "<S> this can be viewed as a task in information retrieval . </S>",
    "<S> a distant region of space contains a bit of information that dictates the presence ( @xmath0 ) or the absence ( @xmath1 ) of the reflecting object . from this point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the goal of illumination is to retrieve the value @xmath2 of a random variable @xmath3 with binary alphabet @xmath4 and uniform distribution @xmath5 .    in the conventional approach </S>",
    "<S> , alice probes the distant region with a suitable quantum system ( where suitable implies a system that the reflector would potentially reflect ) , and monitors for a potential reflection . </S>",

    "<S> the second type , denoted by @xmath47 , quantifies the classical correlations and equals the maximal entropic reduction of system @xmath18 under positive operator - value measure ( povm ) measurements @xmath48 on system @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> explicitly , this is defined by optimizing over all povms as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the von neumann entropy of system @xmath18 and @xmath51 is the entropy of system @xmath18 given the outcome @xmath52 , achieved with probability @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , discord is defined by @xmath54 , therefore catching the quantum type of the bipartite correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have previously said , quantum illumination is able to work thanks to the discord @xmath45 present in the separable state @xmath26 , which is the effective state responsible for sensing the target according to the equivalent quantum circuit in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ discord_schematic ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to explicitly prove the role of discord as a physical resource for quantum illumination , we need to establish a direct connection between discord and the quantum advantage @xmath55 for the resolution of the target .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the global state @xmath56 after the encoding of @xmath2 . to someone completely ignorant of @xmath2 , </S>",

    "<S> thus , the difference @xmath61 represents the amount of discord which is associated with the knowledge of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , it represents the amount of discord which is expended for encoding @xmath2 , i.e. , storing the information about the target , in the effective state @xmath39 . for instance , if there were no encoding of the target , i.e. , target certainly present ( @xmath62 ) or absent ( @xmath63 ) , then we would have @xmath64 . </S>",
