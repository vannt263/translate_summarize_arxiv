    "it is well established that the crab nebula shines in synchrotron radiation .",
    "however the origin of the high energy particles has been a long - standing problem .",
    "the pulsar wind from the central pulsar is certainly the source of the particles and the magnetic fields .",
    "we nevertheless do not know what fraction of the wind energy is in magnetic field and in plasma kinetic energy .",
    "we sometimes introduce the @xmath1-parameter , which is the ratio of the magnetic energy flux to the kinetic one of the wind bulk motion just before the termination shock .",
    "kennel and coroniti ( kc ) ( 1984a , 1984b ) proposed a simple model in which the nebula is expanding hot plasmas after the termination shock of the wind . in their model ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the wind bulk motion converts into heat with non - thermal components .",
    "this picture results in a small value of @xmath1 , i.e. , dominance of the kinetic energy , to explain the observed synchrotron luminosity and the presumed expansion velocity of @xmath4 .",
    "one finds it difficult to reproduce the kinetic energy dominated wind by means of the axisymmetric ideal - mhd model ( michel 1969 , bogovalov 1998 , begelman & li 1994 , tomimatsu 1994 ) , although some possibilities for the small @xmath1 have been pointed out ( okamoto 2002 , vlahakis 2004 ) .",
    "this is referred to as the @xmath1-problem .    because the magnetic axis inclines to the rotation axis ,",
    "the magnetic neutral sheet in the equator is folded for each rotation to produce a series of current sheets flowing out with the wind .",
    "some authors attempt to solve the @xmath1-problem by introducing dissipation of the magnetic field in such current sheets ( coroniti 1990 , kirk & skjaeraasen 2003 ) .",
    "lyubarski ( 2003 ) has proposed that conversion of the magnetic energy to heat takes place when the current sheets come into the termination shock . with this picture ,",
    "poynting energy directly changes to plasma heat and non - thermal particles , so that the pulsar wind should not always be kinetic energy dominant , i.e. , the @xmath1-problem may not be a problem .",
    "magnetic field of the wind is essentially toroidal far beyond the light cylinder owing to rotation .",
    "the nebula field convected from the wind is also believed to be toroidal , indicated by highly axisymmetric structures in the crab nebula .",
    "however , if disruption of the numerous current sheets takes place at or after the termination shock , one may expect that the nebula field is not pure toroidal but it has strong disordered components .",
    "thus , the disordered magnetic field may be a good indicator for energy conversion from the toroidal magnetic field to plasmas . to diagnose disruptive processes of the magnetic field",
    ", it must be very much helpful to measure magnitude of the disordered field .",
    "disordered magnetic field can be detected by image analysis and by polarization analysis .",
    "shibata et al . ( 2003 ; paper i ) calculated images by use of the kc model and compared with the chandra observations",
    ". if the nebula field is pure toroidal , intensity along the major axis of the torus should be reduced , and the images look like ` lips ' rather than rings .",
    "the x - ray images , which appear as rings , indicate that disordered field may be comparable to the mean field .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present an expanding disc model to derive polarization properties of the crab nebula . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution function of the plasma and the energy density of the magnetic field are prescribed as function of the distance from the pulsar by using the model by kennel and coroniti ( 1984 ) with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ratio of poynting flux to the kinetic energy flux in the bulk motion just before the termination shock . unlike previous models , we introduce disordered magnetic field , which is parameterized by the fractional energy density of the disordered component . </S>",
    "<S> flow dynamics is not solved . </S>",
    "<S> the mean field is toroidal .    averaged polarization degree over the disc is obtained as a function of inclination angle and fractional energy density of the disordered magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is found for the crab that the disordered component has about @xmath2 percent of the magnetic field energy . </S>",
    "<S> this value is also supported by the facts that the disc appears not ` lip - shape ' but as ` rings ' in the intensity map as was observed , and that the highest polarization degree of @xmath3 percent is reproduced for rings , being consistent with the observation .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that because the disordered field contributes rather pressure than tension , the pinch force may be over - estimated in previous relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> disruption of the toroidal magnetic field with alternating direction , which is proposed by lyubarski ( 2003 ) , may actually takes place . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic flow speed , which is indicated by the front - back contrast , can be detected in asymmetry in distributions of the position angle and depolarization .    </S>",
