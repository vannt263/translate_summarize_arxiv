    "the recent plethora of scalar meson papers appearing in the los alamos archives  @xcite stresses once again the importance but difficulty in observing the ground state @xmath8 and @xmath9 scalar mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",

    "this is another way ( besides e.g. j/@xmath59 ) to circumvent the four spts discussed in this section .",
    "in most effective chiral field theories ( such as the l@xmath23 m ) , one usually computes consistently either quark loops alone or meson loops alone for a given process .",
    "sometimes one must add together quark and meson loops  @xcite .",

    "leads directly to a ` quark loops alone ' theory  @xcite , such as for @xmath67 .",
    "however for svv transitions , it turns out that _ only _ meson loop graphs contribute .",

    "2b around , if @xmath23 ( as a @xmath69 resonance ) decays to @xmath70 , this spt eats up the needed quark triangle due to the quark box .",
    "this leaves only the meson triangle @xmath71 dominating svv decay @xmath72 .",
    "a more practical example of this theorem is for @xmath73 decay .",
    "first we consider the inverse process @xmath74 , with the @xmath75 final state forming an @xmath76 resonance @xmath77 .",
    "so we should begin by first considering the quark box graph for @xmath78 followed by @xmath79 .",
    "again these quark box plus triangle graphs vanish in the soft pion limit by the spt of sec .",
    "all that remains are the meson loop graphs for @xmath6 decay .    here",
