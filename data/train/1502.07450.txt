    "in a now classical paper in bioinformatics @xcite , hannenhalli and pevzner showed that there is a polynomial time algorithm to sort signed permutations by reversals , i.e. , turn any signed permutation into the identity by reversing subwords ( and flipping their signs ) .",
    "this has important implications for computational phylogenetics : when comparing the sequence of genes of two related species , the shortest length of a sequence of reversals that transforms one into the other is one prominent measure of the evolutionary distance of the associated organisms .",
    "the authors strategy , and one that was improved upon in later work ( for example , @xcite ) , is to construct the so - called `` breakpoint graph '' for the permutation to be sorted , show that a certain operation on the breakpoint graph corresponds to reversals , and then use certain numerical invariants of subgraphs to guide the sequence of moves to the identity .",
    "this framework is now a keystone of bioinformatics algorithms , but it leaves many questions unanswered . in particular , the proposed methodologies generate just one successful sorting of the signed permutation under consideration , and it is understood that there are often many such minimum - length sorting sequences . since each is only representative of one _ possible _ evolutionary history , it would be valuable to be able to sample from all possible such sequences to obtain more sensitive statistical properties .",
    "as of yet , there is no full understanding of the space of possible histories , so markov chain monte carlo methods are valuable for approximately uniform sampling .",
    "such approaches present their own problems , however : it is necessary to obtain a proof of connectivity of the underlying graph of the markov chain to know that it will eventually reach every vertex ; and it is necessary to obtain bounds on the mixing time of the process to ensure that near - uniformity will be achieved in reasonable time .",
    "indeed , some researchers have investigated these very kinds of questions : see , for example , @xcite .    in order to state our results and situate it in the above discussion",
    ", we need the following definitions .",
    "a * bicolored * graph is a pair @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a simple graph , and @xmath3 is a coloring of its vertices .",
    "write @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "denote by @xmath6 the vertex set of a graph , @xmath7 its edge set , and @xmath8 $ ] the induced subgraph of a set @xmath9 ; let @xmath10 denote the neighborhood of @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 the closed neighborhood of @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "consider a bicolored graph , @xmath1 with a black vertex @xmath11 .",
    "`` pressing @xmath14 '' is the operation of transforming @xmath1 into @xmath16 , a new bicolored graph in which @xmath17 $ ] is complemented .",
    "that is , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( where `` @xmath20 '' denotes symmetric difference ) and @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the `` pressing game '' ( to use terminology from @xcite ) is played by pressing black vertices of @xmath2 iteratively with the ultimate goal of transforming @xmath2 into an all - white , empty graph .",
    "hannenhalli and pevzner showed ( @xcite ) that `` successful '' sequences of presses in the breakpoint graph of a signed permutation , i.e. , sequences that result in an all - white empty graph , correspond bijectively to minimum - length sequences of reversals that turn the permutation into the identity . therefore , sampling from successful pressing sequences is equivalent to sampling from the minimum length sequences of reversals that sort a signed permutation . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors make the following `` pressing game conjecture '' :    every successful pressing sequence can be reached from every other one by a sequence of edits that involve at most four deletions or insertions .",
    "if successful pressing sequences are taken to be the vertices of a graph @xmath25 , and the edges correspond to edits of at most four deletions or insertions , then the pressing game conjecture implies that @xmath25 is connected .",
    "then a simple random walk converges to a uniform distribution on the set of all successful pressing sequences , and markov chain monte carlo can be used to analyze typical pressing sequences .",
    "bixby , flint , and mikls @xcite proved the conjecture for paths . despite this , the current authors have doubts about the statement for general graphs .    in the present manuscript",
    ", we explore a few aspects of matrix theory over @xmath0 so as to better understand the successful pressing sequences of a graph . among other results : in corollary [ cor : rank_cor ]",
    ", we show that the rank of the `` augmented adjacency matrix '' of a bicolored graph is the length of every successful pressing sequence of a graph ; theorems [ thm : main_thm ] and [ thm : main_thm2 ] provide a substantial collection of equivalent characterizations of successful pressing sequences ; proposition [ prop : lpqu ] gives a matrix - theoretic formulation of the relationship between successful pressing sequences ; and theorem [ thm : average ] shows that the average number of successful pressing sequences of a random ( full - rank ) bicolored graph is large .",
    "the final section contains several open problems concerning these sequences that arose in connection with the present work .",
    "we note that some special cases of a few of our results are announced but left largely unproven in @xcite ; the authors refer to the matrix analogue of pressing as `` clicking '' and to the condition of the existence of a successful pressing sequence that consists of all vertices as `` tightness . ''",
    "the following result appears ( less explicitly ) in @xcite and @xcite , but we include the proof for completeness .    [",
    "prop : success_is_possible ] any graph with a black vertex in every component has a successful pressing sequence .    it suffices to prove the statement for connected graphs .",
    "let @xmath2 be a connected graph and @xmath26 be the set of black vertices with the fewest possible black neighbors .",
    "choose some @xmath27 such that @xmath28 is maximal in @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath29 is pressed , we obtain @xmath30 . we claim that each component of @xmath30 is either a white isolated vertex or has at least one black vertex .",
    "let @xmath31 be the set of neighbors of @xmath32 , let @xmath33 be the set of vertices in @xmath34 that were white in @xmath2 , and let @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath2 and @xmath30 are identical except on the induced subgraphs of @xmath36 .",
    "every vertex in @xmath37 is in a component with a vertex of @xmath34 ( in both @xmath2 and @xmath30 ) , so it suffices to show that each vertex of @xmath36 is in a component of @xmath30 with a black vertex or is an isolated white vertex .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath30 , @xmath29 is isolated and white and the vertices of @xmath33 are black , so we need only consider the elements of @xmath38 .",
    "pick some @xmath39 . if @xmath40 is adjacent to a black vertex outside of @xmath36 or @xmath40 is not adjacent in @xmath2 to some vertex in @xmath33 , then in @xmath30 , @xmath40 is adjacent to a black vertex .",
    "otherwise , in @xmath2 , @xmath40 is adjacent to all vertices of @xmath33 and its black neighbors are a subset of @xmath41 . by the choice of @xmath29",
    ", this implies that the closed neighborhoods of @xmath29 and @xmath40 are the same in @xmath2 , which implies that @xmath40 is a white isolated vertex in @xmath30 .",
    "the * augmented adjacency matrix * @xmath42 of a bicolored graph @xmath2 on @xmath43 vertices , is the adjacency matrix of @xmath2 where the entries along main diagonal correspond to the vertices @xmath2 and are indexed by the color of the vertex ; @xmath44 if white or @xmath45 if black .",
    "given a bicolored graph @xmath2 , we can define a ( loopy simple , uncolored ) graph @xmath46 to be the graph on the same vertex set with the same edges , but with a loop at each black vertex ( and none at white vertices ) .",
    "a perfect matching in such a graph is a set of edges incident to every vertex exactly once , where a loop is considered to be incident to its vertex only once . a special case of the following result ( that of zero diagonal ) appears in @xcite .    [ prop : matchings ]",
    "the number of perfect matchings in the loopy graph @xmath46 corresponding to a bicolored graph @xmath1 is odd if and only if @xmath47 is invertible over @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the permanent ( which is equal to the determinant in characteristic 2 ) of @xmath47 is equal to @xmath48 where @xmath49 ranges over all _ vertex circuit covers _ , i.e. , families of circuits ( closed walks ) in which each vertex appears exactly once and @xmath50 is the number of such circuits of length greater than two .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "therefore , over @xmath0 , the only terms which make a contribution to @xmath51 are those in which there are no circuits of length more than two , i.e. , every component is a loop or a single edge  precisely the condition of being a perfect matching .",
    "since @xmath52 if and only if @xmath47 is invertible , this is equivalent to there being an odd number of perfect matchings .",
    "define the function @xmath53 on @xmath54 nonzero matrices over @xmath55 as follows ; the action of @xmath56 will amount to a slight modification of gaussian elimination , wherein row - permutations are prohibited and the pivot row is added to itself as well .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the smallest row index of a left - most @xmath45 in @xmath58 , that is , the positive integer for which there exists a @xmath59 so that    1 .",
    "@xmath60 2 .",

    "let @xmath67 be the set of row indices which have a @xmath45 in column @xmath59 , i.e. ,    @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the @xmath54 matrix so that @xmath69 note that , for every matrix @xmath58 , there is a sequence of @xmath57 s and @xmath59 s that arise from the iterative application of @xmath56 to @xmath58 .",
    "that is , given @xmath58 , there is an increasing sequence @xmath70 and increasing sequence @xmath71 which serve as the indices in the above definition of @xmath53 , @xmath72 , etc .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that the sequence must eventually result in the all - zeroes matrix , so this process terminates at some finite @xmath73 .",
    "if , for each @xmath74 $ ] , @xmath75 , we call @xmath58 `` leading principally nonsingular ( lpn ) '' . if @xmath58 is lpn , then the sequence @xmath76 , @xmath77 , is precisely the sequence of matrices one obtains by performing gaussian elimination on @xmath58 , with the additional operation of adding pivot rows to themselves ( thus replacing them with the zero vector ) . furthermore , this elimination does not involve row permutations .",
    "therefore , @xmath58 is row - reducible to a diagonal matrix whose leading principle submatrix of size @xmath78 is the identity matrix @xmath79 , and whose other entries are zero .",
    "note that , if @xmath58 is symmetric , then @xmath53 is , as well .",
    "indeed , @xmath80 therefore , suppose that the @xmath58 above is @xmath47 and is lpn .",
    "then it is straightforward to see that @xmath53 is in fact @xmath81 where @xmath82 is obtained from @xmath2 by pressing its lowest - indexed ( black ) vertex . since @xmath47 being the all - zeroes matrix is precisely the condition that @xmath2 has no edges and all vertices are white , @xmath83 being lpn is equivalent to @xmath2 having a successful pressing sequence consisting of the vertices indexing the first @xmath84 columns of @xmath58 in increasing order .",
