    "<S> the instantaneous populated states from the optical transitions with @xmath131.61 ev should involve the second topological ss ( ss@xmath0 ) above the bulk conduction band ( bcb@xmath38 ) , as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> this scenario is also consistent with the theoretical works of refs . </S>",

    "<S> the spin dynamics characterized by @xmath34 only appears at small @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> in fact , as @xmath5 or @xmath6 decreases , the non - equilibrium spin - polarized electrons excited from ss@xmath38 to ss@xmath0 will be at the edge of bvb@xmath0 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trkr - pic](d ) ] , where strong coupling between ss@xmath0 and bvb@xmath0 exists @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energetic spin - polarized electrons can then efficiently transfer from ss@xmath0 to available bulk states in bvb@xmath0 , while maintaining the polarization direction as in the dynamics characterized by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation also leads to @xmath41 , as they both describe the spin relaxation of the spin - polarized electrons in bvb@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it naturally explains the unusual slow rise time ( @xmath2150 fs ) in the @xmath34 process , which is needed for the charge transfer .    as an intermediate conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our experiments unveil that generation of net spin polarization in three - dimensional tis using @xmath40 photons requires the participation of the topological sss , e.g. , ss@xmath38 and/or ss@xmath0 in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find that by properly tuning @xmath5 or @xmath6 , the spin - polarized electrons excited to unoccupied sss ( e.g. , ss@xmath0 in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ) can have distinct spin relaxation times , depending on whether they are strongly coupled to bulk states or not . </S>",
    "<S> such tunability is essential for the development of future ultrafast spintronic devices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the underlying mechanism behind it requires to be further explored .    in a ti system such as bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , the electron spin precessing around an effective magnetic field with corresponding frequency @xmath42 during a correlation time @xmath43 ( average timescale of spin precession along one direction ) may experience two different spin relaxation mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the dyakonov perel ( dp ) mechanism for sss with spin - momentum locking in absence of the inversion symmetry @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in sss induces the effective magnetic field with the corresponding @xmath42 given by the energy splitting between @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 @xcite , where @xmath47 is the electron wave vector , @xmath48 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath49 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath50 stand for spins with opposite directions . taking @xmath51 ev and @xmath52 fs from infrared transmission measurements @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we thus can obtain @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the second spin relaxation mechanism is the elliot - yafet ( ey ) mechanism for bulk states with inversion symmetry @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the spin - orbit interaction , altered by phonons , causes the couping of different spin states and leads to the spin flips via momentum scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation time @xmath43 is then determined by the momentum scattering time @xmath23 and the inverse of the frequency @xmath54 of relevant thermal phonons @xcite , both of which give @xmath55500 fs , taking @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath58 can be estimated by the strength of soc in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , with a typical value of @xmath59 ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the coupling strength between bulk states bcb@xmath60 and bvb@xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) can be as large as the energy gap ( @xmath62 ev ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 then can also be obtained for the bulk states in ey mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the relation @xmath53 implies that the electron spin precesses many full cycles during @xmath43 around the effective magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarization decays irreversibly after @xmath43 @xcite . </S>",
