    "although massive stars play a critical role in the production of turbulent energy in the ism , in the formation and destruction of molecular clouds , and ultimately in the dynamical and chemo - dynamical evolution of galaxies , our understanding of the sequence of events which leads to their formation is still rather limited . because of their high luminosities we can expect : a ) radiative acceleration will contribute significantly to the dynamical evolution during the formation process and b ) the thermal evolution time scales of massive pre - main sequence objects will be extremely short .",
    "thus , we can not simply `` scale up '' theories of low mass star formation .",
    "furthermore , ob stars form in clusters and associations ; their mutual interactions via gravitational torques , powerful winds and ionizing radiation contribute further to the complexity of the problem .",
    "even though no massive disk has yet been directly observed around a main sequence massive star , it is likely that such disks are the natural consequence of the star formation process even in the high mass case . in their radio recombination maser studies and",
    "co measurements martin - pintado et al .",
    "( 1994 ) do find indirect evidence for both an ionized stellar wind and a neutral disk around mwc349 .",
    "moreover , several other high luminosity fir sources  suspected embedded young ob stars  have powerful bipolar outflows associated with them ( e.g. , eiroa et al .",
    "1994 ; shepherd et al .",
    "such massive outflows are probably powered by disk accretion , and , similar to their low mass counterparts , the flow energetics appear to scale with the luminosity of the source ( see cabrit & bertout 1992 ; shepherd & churchwell 1996 ; richer et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the detailed structure and evolutionary history of massive circumstellar disks has important consequences with regard to the early evolution of these protostars .",
    "disks provide a reservoir of material with specific angular momentum too large to be directly accreted by the central object . only after angular momentum",
    "is transported outwards can this material contribute to the final mass of the star .",
    "the transition region disk - star will strongly influence the star s photospheric appearance and how the star interacts with the disk .",
    "the relative high densities in these disks provide the environment for the further growth and evolution of dust grains , affecting the disk s opacity and consequently its energetics and appearance .",
    "the disk can be expected to interact with stellar outflows and is likely to be directly responsible for the outflows associated with star formation .",
    "disks surrounding massive stars or disks associated with close companions to massive stars should be short - lived compared to their low mass counterparts .",
    "the uv environment within an ob cluster will lead to the photoevaporation of disks on a time scale of a few 10@xmath1  yr ( hollenbach , yorke , & johnstone 2000 ) . because this process operates on a time scale comparable to the formation of massive stars and is competitive to it , it is important to carefully model the transfer of radiation in the envelopes of accreting massive stars .",
    "numerical tools capable of this task are lacking at present .",
    "we consider the present investigation as an important step in this direction .",
    "we consider the simulation of the hydrodynamic collapse of a rotating molecular cloud clump , with wavelength - dependent radiation transfer , under the assumption of symmetry with respect to the rotation axis and the equatorial plane .",
    "our code contains all of the basic features of the 2-d code described in detail by yorke & bodenheimer ( 1999 ; hereafter yb ) . in the following",
    "we shall discuss only the deviations from and enhancements to the yb code .",
    "in addition to artificial viscosity for the treatment of shocks , physical viscosity has been implemented via an @xmath2 prescription ( shakura &  sunyaev 1973 ) : @xmath3 , where we have approximated the local disk scale height by @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the angular velocity and @xmath6 is the sound speed ) .",
    "all components of the viscosity tensor are included , as previously implemented in 2-d disk models by ryczka et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and yb .",
    "contrary to yb , who allowed @xmath2 to vary in time in order to mimic the effects of tidal torques due to the growth of non - axisymmetric gravitational modes , the value for @xmath7 is was kept constant in space and time for all cases considered .",
    "the details of this angular momentum transfer scheme  within certain limits  do not critically affect our results , however , because our central computational zone ( where angular momentum transfer is presumably very critical ) is so large .",
    "test calculations with @xmath8 yielded essentially the same results . by contrast , for @xmath9 ring instabilities developed in the disk which led to a premature ending of the calculations . as discussed by yorke , bodenheimer , laughlin ( 1995 ) , who did not include the effects of angular momentum transfer ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) , these ring instabilities are unrealistic",
    ". such a ring would be unstable on a very short ( dynamical ) time scale and the resulting clumps would exert tidal torques resulting in angular momentum transfer .    as in yb",
    "we utilize a series of hierarchically nested grids ( berger &  colella 1989 ; yorke &  kaisig 1995 ) . whereas yb considered nesting levels of 6 and @xmath11 grids , allowing the innermost grid to be @xmath121/2000 of the cloud radius , here we have considered nesting levels of 3 only and slightly larger grids ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we assume constant density @xmath14 along the outermost radius @xmath15 and allow material to enter into or exit from our computational grid @xmath16 ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the cylindrical coordinates ) , based on the sign of the radial component of the velocity .",
    "by contrast , yb assume a semi - permeable outer boundary at @xmath15 : material with positive radial velocity can leave the computational grid but no mass was allowed to enter .",
    "as in yb the boundary of the the innermost cell of our innermost grid is considered to be semi - permeable : material can flow into this cell but can not flow out of it .",
    "material entering this cell is assumed to accrete onto a single central object .",
    "we realize that this `` sink cell '' procedure is a gross simplification of the physics in the innermost regions of our computational domain and a number of possibly important effects are being ignored , e.g. fragmentation and accretion of material onto multiple objects and the interaction of the accretion flow with powerful outflows . for the cases f30 and g30 ( see section [ inicond ] ) , for instance , our innermost cell is a cylinder of radius 40  au and height 80  au , whereas for the cases f120 and g120 the cell is larger by a factor of four .",
    "although we can not follow the mass flow within and possibly out of this cell , our simulations do provide upper limits to the amount of material which is available to be accreted by the central object : if radiative acceleration prevents the flow of material into the central sink cell , then the central object can not accrete it .",
    "in contrast to yb we consider a slightly more sophisticated treatment of the radius @xmath19 , luminosity @xmath20 , and effective temperature @xmath21 of the central object .",
    "its mass @xmath22 is uniquely determined by integrating the mass flux into the center sink cell : @xmath23 we can express the total energy of the central core in terms of a `` structure parameter '' @xmath24 : @xmath25 in principal , @xmath24 , a parameter describing the compactness of the hydrostatic core , must be calculated by solving for the stellar structure of the accreting hydrostatic core . for polytropes of degree @xmath26",
    ", @xmath24 can be derived analytically ( e.g. kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) : @xmath27 a fully convective pre - main sequence protostar can be approximated by an @xmath28 polytrope and @xmath29 .",
    "as the star approaches the main sequence , a greater proportion of it becomes radiative , its core becomes more compact , and @xmath24 increases .    for purposes of discussion",
    "we shall assume for the moment that @xmath30 is a known function .",
    "in this case the intrinsic core luminosity @xmath20 ( which does not include the contribution to the total luminosity emitted in the accretion shock front and dissipated within the disk ) is given by : @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the contribution from nuclear burning .",
    "in the following we will assume that @xmath33 : the material accreted by the star is being added _ ever so gently _ at its current radius @xmath19 and that this material adds negligible entropy to the star .",
    "the energy gained by the star due to heating from the accretion shock ( `` backwarming '' ) or by dissipating rotational energy within the star is negligible . ] for the total bolometric luminosity of a spherically accreting star , however , we must include the contribution of the potential energy of infalling material as it is dissipated on its way to the stellar surface : @xmath34    equation [ lcore ] shows that for constant @xmath35 the star should increase or decrease its radius due to mass accretion , depending on the sign of the coefficient of @xmath36 . because @xmath37 and @xmath38 during the fully convective hayashi phase , this coefficient is negative ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "thus , mass accretion onto a fully convective star has a tendency to decrease the star s radius , whereas close to the main sequence , where @xmath24 is closer to unity , mass accretion has a tendency to cause the star to bloat up ( see kippenhahn & hofmeister 1977 for a more detailed discussion ) . in reality",
    ", the internal readjustment of the star after it has gained mass also affects the nuclear burning rate and thus has an effect on both radius and luminosity , depending on the magnitude of the mass accretion rate and the star s current position in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram .",
    "a classical problem of the mathematical theory of stellar structure is the question of whether for stars of given fixed parameters , say chemical composition , mass , and radius , there exists one and only one solution of the basic structure equations .",
    "there is actually no mathematical basis for the so - called `` vogt - russell '' conjecture of uniqueness and indeed , multiple solutions for the same set of parameters have been found numerically in some cases ( see discussion by kippenhahn & weigert 1990 ) .",
    "however , for the rather simple cases considered here , spherically symmetric , quasi - hydrostatic homogeneous pre - main sequence and young main sequence stars , knowledge of the star s mass and age at any given time does allow us to uniquely fix its position in the hr diagram , from which we can determine @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath32 .    for the pre - main sequence phase we shall account for deuterium burning only and use the following approximate expression : @xmath40      \\left [ { r_0(m _ * ) \\over r } \\right]^p \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the equilibrium deuterium burning rate and equilibrium radius for a star of mass @xmath22 at its `` birthline , '' @xmath43 is the cosmic mass abundance of deuterium , and @xmath44 is the star s net deuterium abundance . we have assumed @xmath45 , which  because the star s central density @xmath46  corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "this insures that a non - accreting star remains close to its birthline until a significant fraction of its deuterium is consumed .    assuming instantaneous mixing during accretion , the deuterium mass fraction @xmath44 can be calculated from the following equation : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the rate of deuterium consumption due to deuterium burning ( @xmath50 is a constant ) .    from equations [ lcore ] and [ ld ]",
    "we can derive an expression for @xmath51 : @xmath52^{-1 } \\times    \\cr     \\hspace{-2 mm } & & \\hspace{-2 mm }       \\left(\\left [ 2 - { \\beta \\over \\eta } + \\eta_m \\right ] { \\dot m _ * \\over m _ * }      + { l _ * -l_{\\rm nuc } \\over e_{\\rm tot } } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 from knowledge of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 we approximate the pre - main sequence evolution of an accreting protostar by integrating equations [ chid ] and [ drcore - dt ] simultaneously .",
    "how does one actually determine @xmath24 and @xmath20 from knowledge of @xmath22 and @xmath19 ?",
    "for the hayashi phase we have used published pre - main sequence tracks given for the published tracks as a parameterization of the curves .",
    "our evolutionary time @xmath58 results from integrating equation [ drcore - dt ] . ] for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and set @xmath29 . for the mass range 0.1  m@xmath0  @xmath61  m@xmath0   we use the evolutionary tracks of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) , which assume `` cm convection '' ( @xmath62 ) and alexander + ri opacities ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) . for 3  m@xmath0  @xmath65  m@xmath0  we use tracks published by iben ( 1965 )",
    ". both sets of tracks represent a series of stellar models which incorporate the detailed microphysics of convection and stellar atmospheres . for masses",
    "@xmath66  m@xmath0  we have assumed that the evolutionary tracks for non - accreting stars are horizontal lines at the main sequence luminosity , similar to the 15  m@xmath0  track ( see fig . [ fig - hrd ] ) , and the main sequence values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 were taken from allen ( 1973 ) .    as the contracting protostellar becomes radiative , @xmath24 increases .",
    "once the star reaches the main sequence hydrogen burning commences and @xmath69  const .",
    "we approximate @xmath24 during this phase by approximating the main sequence by polytropic models with the restriction that the main sequence value @xmath70 .",
    "obviously , this is a very rough approximation , but because we expect @xmath71 and @xmath72 on the main sequence , we are not making a significant error .",
    "our greatest error arises during the transition from @xmath29 ( fully convective ) to @xmath73 , where we have used interpolated values .    of course",
    ", we could obtain a much better approximation to these physical parameters by solving the full set of radiation hydrodynamic equations for an accreting hydrostatic object .",
    "this , however , goes far beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "we merely wish to obtain more realistic approximations for @xmath20 and @xmath19 than those used by yb which were based on the pre - main sequence evolution of non - accreting low mass protostars . because massive stars require at least one phase of high accretion rates , typically @xmath74",
    "m@xmath0  yr@xmath75 , the effects of accretion on the evolution of @xmath20 and @xmath19 can not be completely neglected . to illustrate this quantitatively we display the evolution of ( proto-)stars accreting at given constant rates in the hr diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig - hrd ] ) .",
    "these tracks compare very well with published , more detailed calculations by behrend & maeder ( 2001 ) and by meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) .",
    "not only do the tracks lie slightly below the equilibrium deuterium burning `` birthline '' in all cases , but the qualitative effect of rapid accretion  namely to shift the tracks to even smaller radii below the `` birthline ''  occurs both in our simplified model and the above cited calculations .",
    "the reason for this is the negative sign of @xmath76 for fully convective stars .",
    "the tracks of our simplified model converge to the main sequence in a manner similar to those of the detailed calculations .",
    "there are some differences , however .",
    "behrend & maeder and meynet & maeder _ begin _ their tracks assuming a fully convective 0.7 m@xmath0star taken to be @xmath77  yr old , whereas we show here that the equilibrium deuterium - burning position at cosmic deuterium abundance is never reached via accretion for masses @xmath78  m@xmath0 .",
    "if you add mass too quickly , the star s radius is reduced as discussed above . if you add it too slowly ( see @xmath79  m@xmath0  yr@xmath75 track in fig .",
    "[ fig - hrd ] ) , a significant amount of the deuterium is consumed even before 0.7  m@xmath0  has been accreted .",
    "other differences are accountable by the different time dependent accretion rates .",
    "we remind the reader that these tracks in the hr diagram do not reflect the actual observable bolometric luminosities of accreting protostars .",
    "much of the accretion luminosity will be indistinguishable from the intrinsic luminosity of the star . for our hydrodynamic simulations we will include the effects of the accretion luminosity when discussing the star s evolution within the hr diagram .",
    "as in yb we add the accretion luminosity @xmath80 ( adams & shu 1986 ) to the core s intrinsic luminosity to obtain the total luminosity @xmath81 equation [ ltot ] differs from equation [ lbol ] ( for @xmath82 ) , because approximately 1/4 of the total potential energy of the accreted material is dissipated within the disk and is already accounted for by our treatment of viscosity .    finally , knowing @xmath83 and @xmath19 allows us to determine @xmath21 from : @xmath84 @xmath85 is the stefan - boltzmann radiation constant .",
    "when discussing the evolution of the central star in the hr diagram , we use @xmath20 rather than @xmath83 in equation [ equ - ltr ] .",
    "the principal source of opacity is due to absorption and scattering by dust ( cf . yorke & henning 1994 ) .",
    "we have adopted the detailed frequency dependent grain model of preibisch et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which assumes a mixture of small amorphous carbon particles ( for grain temperatures @xmath86  k ) and `` astrophysical silicate '' grains ( for temperatures",

    "non - uniformly distributed frequency points between 5000 @xmath94 m and 0.1 @xmath94 m .",

    "the numerical problem can be greatly simplified by resorting to the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation ( see yorke &  kaisig 1995 , levermore &  pomraning 1981 ) .",

    "the accretion process has stopped and a cylindrical shell first forms , contracts to a smaller cylindrical radius with a more focused polar outflow ( frame [ fig - f120]e ) , and then reexpands ( frame [ fig - f120]f ) . whereas for earlier evolutionary times the gas density was higher in the equatorial regions than in the polar outflow regions , the final frame strongly resembles an expanding `` cocoon '' shell , punctured and elongated by a polar outflow .",
    "no disk - like structure is visible .      with the known density and equilibrium temperature distributions of each dust component calculated for each time step",

    ", we have made no attempt to model the emission from a hypothetical disk within the central cell ( see yb s `` central zone disk model '' ) , we will not be able to accurately model the emission from dust warmer than about 400  k. even in the rather late formation stages considered here  the central stars have evolved to main sequence o - stars , very little near infrared and no optical / ultraviolet radiation escapes the remnant molecular cloud .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that a non - homogeneous distribution of material within the central zone ( i.e. clumpiness or a flattened disk ) would have allowed at least some of the hard photons from the central source to escape .",
    "thus , the examples given here can only be illustrative of the basic method rather than an accurate model of the expected near infrared to ultraviolet flux .",
    "unfortunately , our ignorance of the goings - on within the central zone preclude a more definitive treatment .",
    "our improved frequency dependent radiation hydrodynamics code is able to track the infall of material within a molecular clump against radiative forces .",
    "we find that the `` flashlight effect '' first discussed by yorke & bodenheimer ( 1999 ) , i.e. the non - isotropic distribution of radiative flux that occurs when a circumstellar disk forms , is strongly compounded by the frequency dependent radiation transfer . the shortest wavelength radiation ( which is also the most effective for radiative acceleration ) is most strongly concentrated towards the polar directions , whereas the longer wavelength radiation ( less effective radiative acceleration ) is more or less isotropic .",
    "we conclude that massive stars can in principle be formed via accretion through a disk , in a manner analogous to the formation of lower mass stars . a powerful radiation - driven outflow in the polar directions and a `` puffed - up '' ( thick ) disk result from the high luminosity of the central source .",
    "we have developed a simplified model for following the evolution of accreting ( proto- ) stars , using existing tracks for non - accreting stars . with this model",
    "we have shown that in the case of massive star formation the energy released within the accretion shock front , the `` accretion luminosity '' , is _ not _ the dominant source of luminosity after a few thousand years of evolution .",
    "the accretion rate onto the central source is time - dependent .",
    "it rises sharply after one free - fall time to a maximum value and falls off gradually ( in the frequency - dependent cases ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the expectations of meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) and behrend & maeder ( 2001 ) , who have assumed mass accretion rates @xmath206 that increase monotonically in time up to a maximum value .",
    "we have also shown that the concept of `` birthline '' , the equilibrium position of fully convective , deuterium - burning stars in the hr diagram with cosmic deuterium abundance , is  strictly speaking  unattainable for stars more massive than 1  m@xmath0 .",
    "beginning with a protostar of a fraction of a solar mass and building up via accretion to 1  m@xmath0  and higher masses , it either accretes too rapidly ( shifting the hr position to smaller radii ) or it accretes too slowly ( significant amounts of previously accreted deuterium are consumed ) . for masses @xmath222  m@xmath0 , however , the contribution of the accretion luminosity may make the star _",
    "appear _ to lie on or above the birthline .    in this investigation",
    "we have not addressed the issues of the longevity of the circumstellar disk or the possible formation of a dense stellar cluster within our central computational zone rather than a single star . however , even without the assumption of ionizing radiation , we find that these disks are not long - lived phenomena . in the most massive cases",
    "the effects of radiative acceleration eventually disperse the remnant disks .",

    "<S> we calculate numerically the collapse of slowly rotating , non - magnetic , massive molecular clumps of masses 30  m@xmath0 , 60  m@xmath0 , and 120  m@xmath0 , which conceivably could lead to the formation of massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> because radiative acceleration on dust grains plays a critical role in the clump s dynamical evolution , we have improved the module for continuum radiation transfer in an existing 2d ( axial symmetry assumed ) radiation hydrodynamic code . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , rather than using `` grey '' dust opacities and `` grey '' radiation transfer , we calculate the dust s wavelength - dependent absorption and emission simultaneously with the radiation density at each wavelength and the equilibrium temperatures of three grain components : amorphous carbon particles , silicates , and `` dirty ice''-coated silicates . </S>",
    "<S> because our simulations can not spatially resolve the innermost regions of the molecular clump , however , we can not distinguish between the formation of a dense central cluster or a single massive object . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can not exclude significant mass loss from the central object(s ) which may interact with the inflow into the central grid cell . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with our basic assumption that all material in the innermost grid cell accretes onto a single object , we are only able to provide an upper limit to the mass of stars which could possibly be formed .    </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a semi - analytical scheme for augmenting existing evolutionary tracks of pre - main sequence protostars by including the effects of accretion . by considering an open outermost boundary , an arbitrary amount of material </S>",
    "<S> could , in principal , be accreted onto this central star . however , for the three cases considered ( 30  m@xmath0 , 60  m@xmath0 , and 120  m@xmath0   originally within the computation grid ) , radiation acceleration limited the final masses to 31.6  m@xmath0 , 33.6  m@xmath0 , and 42.9  m@xmath0 , respectively , for wavelength - dependent radiation transfer and to 19.1  m@xmath0 , 20.1  m@xmath0 , and 22.9  m@xmath0  for the corresponding simulations with grey radiation transfer . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations demonstrate that massive stars can in principle be formed via accretion through a disk . </S>",
    "<S> the accretion rate onto the central source increases rapidly after one initial free - fall time and decreases monotonically afterwards . by enhancing the non - isotropic character of the radiation field </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disk reduces the effects of radiative acceleration in the radial direction  a process we denote the `` flashlight effect '' . </S>",
    "<S> the flashlight effect is further amplified in our case by including the effects of frequency dependent radiation transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with the warning that a careful treatment of radiation transfer is a mandatory requirement for realistic simulations of the formation of massive stars . </S>"
