    "precessional activity has long been invoked to explain time variations occurring in the spectra of galactic x - ray binaries like lmc x-4 , her x-1 , ss 443 , cygnus x-1 , etc .",
    "observational evidences give support to the idea that these systems , and quite a lot of suspected others , consist of a disk - like system plus a third body .",
    "this is very suggestive of precession as being the effect due to the perturbing torque of a distant companion star in the the disk or , even , as the result in the disk of the secondary star precessing in the tidal field of the central compact object . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the scenario is not unique , and according to @xcite , there are , at least , five possibilities .",
    "this is so because there is uncertainty concerning the reason why the disk precesses , where and the extent on it that precesses .",
    "the possibilities explicitly dependent upon tidal torques under which the disk will precess can be summarized by the following two scenarios :    a- the disk has a permanently tilted edge that freely precesses in the tidal field of the companion star .",
    "this kind of scenario has been first exploited by @xcite , trying to explain the 35 day period on the light curve of her x-1 .",
    "this same model was used by @xcite to explain observational features in ss 443 ;    b- the companion star precesses in the tidal field of the central compact star , slavishly followed by the the outer tilted disk .",
    "this kind of scheme was proposed by @xcite , also to explain the 35 day period observed in her x-1 .    however , precession is not a exclusiveness of galactic x -ray binaries sources , its presence being suspected in a lot of other astrophysical systems .",
    "jet structures observed in agn , and also in protostars seem to be associated with a precessing disk ( @xcite ) . in the context of disks around supermassive objects , the reason why the disk precesses is still more unclear .",
    "@xcite suggested that observational data in oj 287 could be explained by a tidal torque due to the presence of another massive companion star , in a way similar to that employed to her x-1 and ss 443 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggests precession as a result of a warping instability caused by the central source irradiation .",
    "@xcite argue , in analogy with @xciteand @xcite , , aiming to explain the pattern of ejection observed in the quasar 3c 273 , that precession is due to a massive secondary black hole tidal torque on the disk , a model , subsequently , applied to 3c 345 by @xcite .",
    "it should be argued , however , that precession is a kind of solid - like response of the disk .",
    "a fluid - like response would be a more appropriate one for a fluid system like the disk . besides , in the case of fluid - like response , the tidal torque acts as a perturbation , which main consequence is the generation of different sort of waves .",
    "quite a variety of physical issues , suitable for a wave approach , such as several tidally driven instabilities , disk tidal deformation ( warping ) , horizontally and vertically driven resonances , angular momentum transport , and so on ( @xcite ) have been tackled quite successfully .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that , under this approach , for disks in systems with extreme mass ratio , precession may occur due to a coupling between an eccentric instability and lindblad resonances ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , extending @xcite result , argue that the axisymmetric part of the tidal potential is related to the disk solid - like response , while the disk fluid - like response is related to the non - symmetric part of the potential . in these works ,",
    "the the disk solid body - like response comes as an integrabil;ity condition .",
    "@xcite proposal to compute frequencies treats the disk as a ring , with no allowance given for the width in the plane of the ring , nor to the thickness perpendicular to that plane . by employing a suitable averaging procedure , he obtains for the for the precession angular velocity    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the keplerian angular velocity of the secondary",
    ", @xmath4 is the ring angular velocity , and @xmath5 is the inclination angle .",
    "this formalism , besides treating the disk as a rigid body , not taking into account its structure , assumes the disk angular velocity parallel to the disk angular momentum .",
    "though keeping @xmath6 parallel to @xmath7 , assuming thin disks obeying polytropic equation of state , the structure has been considered by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "decomposing the secondary tidal potential into odd and even z parts , with subsequent fourier decomposition , and arguing that the odd axisymmetric part is responsible for rigid precession , these authors , assuming @xmath8 constant , obtain    @xmath9    as an integrability condition . in this expression",
    ", n is the polytropic index and @xmath4 is the disk angular velocity evaluated at the outer edge of the disk , @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , they recover @xcite result . according to them ,",
    "the validity of this result holds whenever the disk does nt thicken , the perturbative tidal potential is weak , and , above all , the sound crossing time is shorter than the precession period",
    ". it should be argued , however , that the disk angular momentum and the precession velocity are not parallel . besides , heat generation , cooling and angular momentum transport do occur in accretion disks , a fact that makes not realistic the structure obtained from a polytropic equation of state .",
    "this imposes severe restrictions on the model of disk we want to consider.it is reasonable to expect the polytropic index varying from @xmath12 , for a ( monoatomic ) gas pressure dominated disk , to @xmath13 for a radiation pressure dominated one .",
    "disks with negligible temperature gradients would require a polytropic index much greater than 3 : @xmath14 is appropriate for an isothermal atmosphere ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in that situation , the mass content in the disk , the moment of inertia and the precession velocity are determined by values close to the inner radius rather than close to the outer radius , the disk structure being very susceptible to relativistic corrections and gravitational radiation losses may become important .",
    "besides , if one is interested in a region in parameter space @xmath16 where the disk thickens , the dynamics can not be dissociated from the structure , as is the case for the keplerian thin disk . in other words ,",
    "the azimuthal velocity depends on the disk height scale .",
    "in addition , for a given tidal potential , its relative strength increases as the disk thickens . for actual radiation pressure dominated , the height scale is constant , the polytropic index is negative , implying negative specific heat . besides this",
    ", in this case , one can not satisfy null boundary condition at the surface of the disk finally , the precession period diminishes relative to the sound crossing time as the disk gets thick . a final possible question concerning the applicability of of these results to disks is related to the precession velocity dependence on the outer radius of the disk , which yields proportionality with the mass of the disk . despite implying larger inertia moments , the larger the mass the faster the disk will precess .",
    "@xcite work consists essentially of the application of @xcite and @xcite to a binary system composed by a disk around a primary supermassive black hole , plus a supermassive secondary orbiting the primary in a keplerian way , not coplanar to the disk .",
    "it should be argued , however , that the formulation followed by these authors , besides suffering from the drawbacks , we just mentioned , of any precessing disk model , relies heavily on the above cited authors results for the precession angular velocity , which was obtained without considering the precession contribution to the total angular momentum . besides",
    ", this model is supposed to apply to disks eventually dominated by radiation pressure .",
    "in addition , account of the precession contribution to the angular momentum introduces some non - linearity in the problem , which , in turn , introduces conditions on the averaging procedure , imposing constraints on the density , on the disk unperturbed angular velocity , on the viscosity parameter as well as on the height scale of the disk . in that case",
    ", there will be a contribution from the precession velocity to a motion in a plane perpendicular to the plane containing the normal to the disk and the normal to the plane of the orbit of the secondary .",
    "this motion , depending on the magnitude of its time scale , will be periodic or not .",
    "in the following we shall address the question of precession in accretion disks in systems similar to that considered by @xcite . in our formulation ,",
    "however , we will be concerned to treat the secondary tidal torque on the disk as a perturbation , which means that the secondary never crosses the disk , being far away from any point in the disk .",
    "granted this , we will take into account the precession contribution to the total angular momentum and will discuss the conditions under which we may take an average of the euler equations , in such a way as to keep algebraic solutions to the precessional motion .",
    "deviations from the precessional motion will be treated by solving the equation for the time evolution of @xmath5 , the angle that measures the misalignment between the normal to the plane of the disk and the normal to the plane of the secondary orbit .",
    "the time evolution will be obtained assuming the time scale for this motion is large or comparable to the remaining time scales .",
    "we obtain results for the precession velocity for different disk models , taking into account deviations from geometrical thinness due to a relation between the angular velocity of the disk and the height scale .",
    "one of the main results of this work is to show that , if precession is to occur in the inner region of disks around a supermassive black hole , the disk is not keplerian , being very thick and luminosity deficient .",
    "the system we consider is a binary one composed by a primary compact object ( a black hole ) , of mass @xmath17 , a massive secondary object ( another black hole ) , of mass @xmath18 , and an accretion disk around the primary one .",
    "the secondary is orbiting the primary plus disk in a plane inclined of an angle @xmath19 relative to the normal of the plane of the disk . working in a reference frame tied to the disk , a point on",
    "it is at a distance @xmath20 from the center ( the primary star ) and has coordinates ( _ x , y , z _ ) or ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the line of nodes will be chosen coincident with the x - axis , and the position of the perturber ( secondary ) will be    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the angular velocity of the secondary .",
    "the potential at the point ( r , @xmath24 , z ) is    @xmath25    g being the gravitational constant .",
    "the first term is the potential due to the primary , the second is the tidal potential due to the secondary , and the last takes into account the acceleration of the coordinate system .",
    "the tidal force per unit mass will be    @xmath26    @xmath27    and    @xmath28    where a , b , c , e , n , and q are given by    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    to obtain the the precession angular velocity we must take into account its contribution to the angular momentum . in fig.1 , we present a schematic representation of the system we are considering .    where z is the coordinate normal to the plane of the disk and @xmath35 , the precession angular velocity , makes an angle @xmath36 with z. therefore , the angular momentum is no longer parallel to the normal to the plane of the disk , and we may write    @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively the moments of inertia relative to an axis normal to the plane of the disk and another that lies in the plane of the disk ( z=0 ) ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are angular velocities parallel to those axes . it is straightforward to see    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45 being the angular velocity in the disk .",
    "so , applying these considerations to an element of matter ( a ring ) in the disk , we obtain    @xmath46    @xmath47    or    @xmath48    with @xmath49 being the differential element of torque perpendicular to the angular momentum , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the moments of inertia of the ring .    to obtain the precession velocity for a ring , it suffices to solve only for an element of torque perpendicular to z , say @xmath52 .",
    "clearly ,    @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    finally , we may write    @xmath56    a rapid inspection in this equation tell us that :    a- there is a constraint on@xmath57 that should be satisfied in order to have a solution for the precession velocity . if this constraint is satisfied we may assume the angular precession velocity approximately constant in time , as long as the time associated to its derivative is much longer than the precession period .",
    "if these conditions are not met , we should solve the differential euler equations ;    b- if these constraints are satisfied , the precessing disk will admit double solutions .",
    "these solutions will be functions of @xmath58 .",
    "it should be remarked that this treatment differs , e.g. , from that of @xcite , @xcite in the sense that    - it takes into account the precessing angular velocity contribution to the angular momentum of the disk , - it obtains constraints , conditions to the validity of such a treatment , - and the solution is double valued .",
    "from equation ( 19 ) , of the previous section , one can easily see that the constraints on the precessing disk comes from the inequality    @xmath59    setting @xmath60 , where @xmath61 , the height scale of the disk , is related to @xmath62 , the density , through    @xmath63    with @xmath64 being the keplerian velocity , @xmath65 is the accretion rate , s a function that takes into account boundary conditions on the angular momentum and on the torque , and is given by    @xmath66    @xmath67 being the angular momentum in units of the keplerian one , @xmath68 being this ratio at the inner radius @xmath69 , the inequality may be worked out to read , approximately ,    @xmath70    @xmath71    and    @xmath72    where    @xmath73    the solution to the first inequality is , approximately ,    @xmath74    concerning the second inequality , if    @xmath75    it will hold everywhere in the precessing disk . therefore , using the definition of @xmath76 , we may rewrite    @xmath77    and    @xmath78    since @xmath79 , the solution is given by the last expression . otherwise , if    @xmath80    we obtain    @xmath81    or    @xmath82 which may be rewritten    @xmath83    it should be remarked that we may change inequality ( 32 ) into a condition on the masses , which reads    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the size of the disk in units of schwarzschild radius and the distance between the primary and the secondary is expressed in units of @xmath86 cm .",
    "our main interest are systems with @xmath87 , a situation in which we may treat the tidal torque as a perturbation . under this condition",
    "we may expand @xmath88 , given by ( eq.(6 ) , to second order in @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and since the constraints obtained in the previous section are satisfied , we may take the average over @xmath91 and t on eq.(21 ) .",
    "after some straightforward but tedious algebraic manipulations , we obtain    @xmath92    where @xmath3 is the keplerian velocity of the secondary .",
    "we now specialize this equation for the average on z and write it in terms of the density @xmath93 , i.e. ,    @xmath94    to see the behavior of @xmath95 in terms of the density , let us first define the parameter p as    @xmath96    and to have a better insight into the precession problem in accretion disks and to summarize the results we have obtained so far , we write the characteristic densities @xmath97 and the actual density , @xmath98 , in terms of p and @xmath99 , the value of p for disks , i.e. ,    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    for @xmath104 , there is no constraint and our treatment will be valid for any density . as p grows , but still @xmath105 , there is a characteristic density in the problem and our treatment only holds for @xmath106 . for @xmath107 , there appear two more characteristic densities in the problem , @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in the region",
    "@xmath110 our treatment does nt apply as well .    for disks we are interested in , such as the @xmath111-standard , slim and advective models , @xmath112 .",
    "the equality at the left occurs when the disk gets thick either due to a huge accretion rate or advection .",
    "in that situation , @xmath113    now , we plot @xmath114 , assuming @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "figure 2 above shows that , in the upper branch , @xmath118 decreases in the range @xmath119 , and then increases in @xmath120 ; in the other two branches , @xmath121 grows with increasing density . for @xmath122 , respectively , in the upper and middle branches . for @xmath123 , @xmath124 in the lower and upper branches . in the middle branch , @xmath125 .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath126 .",
    "angular velocities are in units of the keplerian one",
    ".    therefore , we will have , in the middle branch ,    @xmath127 in the lower branch ,    @xmath128    and , in the upper branch ,    @xmath129    from equations ( 38 ) to ( 40 ) , we can see a huge spread in the value of the precession velocity due to the effect of the density .    since for actual disks@xmath130 and @xmath131 ,",
    "the solutions are at the right of @xmath132 . as a matter of fact , for the @xmath133 standard model",
    ", the actual density is much greater than @xmath134 , the asymptotical behavior is a good approximation . using this limit",
    ", we may see that differential precession is drastically reduced as compared to katz 1973 result .",
    "it should be remarked that the constraints we have are much more restrictive than those obtained directly from equation ( 35 ) , which are , approximately ,    @xmath135    now , we ask ourselves if , within this formalism , it is possible to recover @xcite result for the precession velocity , i.e. ,    @xmath136    to answer this question we insert the above expression for the precession velocity into equation ( 35 ) , to obtain    @xmath137    since @xmath138 , it implies @xmath139 , or    @xmath140    therefore , we must conclude that , under our formalism , @xcite results only applies to disks with density profile quite different from that expected under the keplerian @xmath133 thin disk approximation . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the results are in complete disagreement with this approximation .",
    "differently from @xcite , in ou formalism , deviations from the mean precessional motion ca nt be treated as perturbations , i.e. , nodding motions . as will be shown ,",
    "the amplitude of these motions , though small for the precessional time scale , is quite large , as far as the appropriate time scale is considered . as a matter of fact",
    ", these deviations may not be periodic motions , but motions in which misalignment increases with time .",
    "the prevailing scenario will depend on the time scales involved .",
    "the importance of the misalignment motion in our formulation can be seen in the time evolution of @xmath5 . from equation ( 15 ) ,    @xmath141    now , suppose that for some unespecified reason , @xmath95 is given by the extreme right of the middle branch .",
    "then , the time evolution will be given by the solution of    @xmath142    which is    @xmath143    where b is an integration constant . from figure 1",
    ", we see that @xmath36 is the angle between z and z , respectively the normal to the plane of the disk and the normal to the plane of the secondary orbit .",
    "@xmath144 lies in the plane zz , and is normal to z. therefore , if @xmath145 is the angle between z and zat @xmath146 , we must have , at any time ,    @xmath147    where @xmath148 is the angle in a plane that contains z and is normal to @xmath149 . assuming that for @xmath150 , @xmath151 , we obtain    @xmath152    and    @xmath153    where    @xmath154    we see that , as time goes on , the misalignment increases .",
    "now , if we take our solution from the lower branch , assuming the unperturbed disk to be quasi keplerian ,    @xmath155    and    @xmath156    proceeding in the same way as we did before , imposing the same boundary conditions , we obtain @xmath157 and    @xmath158    it is easily seen that this solution holds for @xmath159 , where    @xmath160    and for @xmath161 , in a very fast way , @xmath162 .",
    "finally , let us analyse the situation @xmath67 very small in the middle branch .",
    "this implies    @xmath163    and    @xmath164    where a is defined in the previous equation . making the substitution @xmath165    yields    @xmath166",
    "since we are only interested in the behavior of the solution , we make the approximation    @xmath167    where @xmath168 stands for an average .",
    "then ,    @xmath169    @xmath170    @xmath171    again , the solution only holds for @xmath159 , where    @xmath172    to obtain the time evolution of @xmath5 we have assumed that the time scales associated to it are much longer than the remaining time scales in the problem , so any function of @xmath5 survives to the averaging process . in other words , even after the averaging process , for any@xmath173 , @xmath5 is considered the instantaneous value .",
    "however , if the time scales are comparable , equation ( 45 ) should be interpreted as    @xmath174    the solution being    @xmath175    and    @xmath176    clearly , we have not considered viscosity in our formalism .",
    "its inclusion certainly invalidates the use of eq.(45 ) to study the temporal evolution of the inclination angle @xmath36 .",
    "we should use , instead , a second order differential equation .",
    "most of the work on the literature assume an keplerian disk precessing under the perturbing influence of a third body , and to answer that question we shall take a naive approach to the angular momentum transport in the disk .",
    "if @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 are , respectively , the inwards angular momentum transport ( per unit time ) , the rate at which the angular momentum flows into the central compact object and the outwards flux of angular momentum , we have    @xmath180 and we may write    @xmath181    @xmath182 and    @xmath183    where @xmath184 is the stress tensor given by    @xmath185    @xmath186 being the rate of strain tensor , given by    @xmath187    where @xmath188 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "then , the angular momentum conservation may be written as    @xmath189    in the above equation , we have assumed null boundary condition for the torque at the inner radius @xmath190 .",
    "this yields for the energy dissipation , neglecting @xmath191 dependence on r ,    @xmath192    and for the density    @xmath193    now , we write the energy conservation , as matter in the disk moves from a point @xmath194 to a point r , as    @xmath195    where @xmath196 is the variation of potential energy , @xmath197 the variation of kinetic energy , @xmath198 is the variation of the internal energy and @xmath199 is the total amount of energy that leaves the system from @xmath200 to r. writing for the radial velocity @xmath201    we obtain , assuming @xmath202 , and that the heat produced by shear leaves the system ,    @xmath203    where , again , we have neglected @xmath204 dependence on r . collecting like terms , we get    @xmath205    which tells us that the keplerian approximation only holds for @xmath206 and @xmath207 . under the assumption of thin disk and @xmath208 , for @xmath209 , @xmath210 .",
    "now , assuming @xmath211 , and using inequality ( 29 ) , i.e. ,    @xmath212    leads to    @xmath213    and , since @xmath214 , this implies @xmath215 or , approximately , since @xmath216 , @xmath217 which means the breakdown of the keplerian and thin disk approximations . despite not having treated rigorously the angular momentum transport ,",
    "this result is quite general , as it may be seen by considering the r - component of the force equation ,    @xmath218    which , after using the expression for @xmath98 when the disk gets thick , is integrated to give    @xmath219    yielding    @xmath220    to analyse the situation @xmath221 , the sign of inequality ( 78 ) is inverted , i.e. ,    @xmath222    and since @xmath223 , a trivial solution is @xmath224 .",
    "therefore , we are led to the conclusion that @xmath225 implies @xmath226 , and @xmath227 , @xmath228 .",
    "it should be reminded that the inner region of accretion disks around supermassive black holes gets thicker either due to the radiation pressure dominance or to the ineffective radiative cooling , a situation in which advection becomes the dominant cooling mechanism , and @xmath229 .    from these results , and",
    "those of the previous section , we must conclude that advective disks will precess with a velocity close to that given by @xmath230 , i.e. ,    @xmath231    and the standard-@xmath232 keplerian thin disk will precess , roughly , with the asymptotic value of the precessing velocity , i.e. ,    @xmath233",
    "the rate of precession depends on the kind of disk model we are assuming .",
    "different models give different relations between p and @xmath234 , as a consequence different precession rates .",
    "besides , we have seen @xmath67 is related to the scale height of the disk through @xmath235    which means    @xmath236    inserting this relation into the definition of p , equation ( 62 ) , to rewrite it as    @xmath237    for the @xmath238-standard model , assuming black - body emission and gas pressure dominance    @xmath239    and    @xmath240    @xmath241 and @xmath242 are , respectively , the mass of the primary in units of @xmath243 solar masses and the accretion rate in units of 1 solar mass per year .    therefore , under these assumptions , the disk is keplerian and our formalism holds everywhere .",
    "the precession velocity will be given by the asymptotic limit of the middle branch , with @xmath244 ,    @xmath245    to finalize , we can easily conclude that the @xmath232-thin keplerian disk is not affected by the constraints on the density .",
    "this , certainly , is not the case if the disk is thick .",
    "let us now examine a disk radiative pressure dominated .",
    "let us also assume cooling due to radiation",
    ". in that case ,    @xmath246    @xmath247    @xmath248    this implies , using equation ( 72 ) , approximately ,    @xmath249    the solution being    @xmath250    or    @xmath251    where    @xmath252    and z , now , is the radial distance in units of @xmath253 .    in figure 3 ,",
    "below , we plot @xmath254 .    using equation ( 87 ) , and imposing @xmath255 , we obtain    @xmath256    which , using equation ( 94 ) above , changes to    @xmath257    @xmath258    expressing @xmath259 in terms of the precession period , @xmath260 , and z in terms of a , yields    @xmath261    inserting into equation ( 97 ) and defining    @xmath262    we get    @xmath263    below , a plot of @xmath264 .",
    "a glance at this figure shows that if we are looking for a solution with @xmath265 , we should choose around @xmath266 .",

    "it is worth remarking that an acceptable solution gives @xmath272 , or @xmath273 if the primary is a schwarzschild black hole , or @xmath274 for an extremely rotating kerr black hole . assuming these constraints do apply ,",
    "we may write    @xmath275    however , if they do nt apply , @xmath276 everywhere . then , use of equations ( 89 ) and ( 98 ) will lead to    @xmath277    since p given above has to be smaller than p given by equation ( 102 ) , we obtain a lower bound on @xmath260 , given by    @xmath278    below , we plot @xmath279 for @xmath280 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 .    finally , if the disk is radiation pressure dominated and cooled by advection , equation ( 92 ) changes to    @xmath283    the solution being    @xmath284    or    @xmath285    and equation ( 100 ) changes to    @xmath286    @xmath287    where y and a have been previously defined .",
    "below , we plot @xmath288 and @xmath289 .    proceeding as before , we look for a solution with @xmath290 . this will force us to look around @xmath291 , yielding    @xmath292 @xmath293 @xmath294 @xmath295 @xmath296 @xmath297    reasoning as we did before , @xmath298 if the primary is a schwarzschild black hole and @xmath299 for an extremely rotating kerr blak hole . the p profile in the disk",
    "is still given by equation ( 102 ) .",
    "again , if these constraints on the density do nt apply , p will be    @xmath300    and the lower bound on the precession period @xmath301    figure 5 gives @xmath302 for @xmath303 , @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
    "we have treated the problem of precession in accretion disks taking into account its contribution to the total angular momentum .",
    "we have looked for conditions under which the problem may be treated by solving the algebraic euler equations , i.e. , constant angular velocities . we have found that the problem is characterized by the parameter p , given by              for @xmath308 , the only constraint is @xmath309 , and the solutions , as a function of the density , lie in three branches : the upper one , with prograde precession velocities , at the upper left of @xmath310 ; the lower branch , with retrograde velocities , at the lower right of @xmath310 ; and the middle branch , between the upper and the lower , in which the solution is retrograde for @xmath311 , and prograde for @xmath312 .",
    "for @xmath313 , part of the @xmath76-space , @xmath314 , is not allowed .",
    "using simple energy and angular momentum transport arguments , together with constraints obtained in that formulation , it is shown that , for @xmath315 , @xmath316 and @xmath317 , leading to the breakdown of the keplerian and thin disk approximations .",
    "in that situation the disk is luminosity defficient . as a matter of fact , a very important contribution of this paper is to show the incompatibility between keplerian disk and thick disk .",
    "the procedure we have adopted is suitable for treating deviations from the mean precessional motion , the misalignment motion , as well . for different limiting expressions for the precession velocity",
    ", we have obtained the time evolution for @xmath19 , the angle that measures the misalignement of the plane of the disk and the orbital plane of the secondary star , the misalignment angle .",
    "it has been shown that the time evolution of @xmath36 depends on the magnitude of the time scale associated to this motion .",
    "periodic motions only occur if this time scale is comparable to the remaining ones .",
    "otherwise , there will be a tendency to force the plane of the disk to become normal to the secondary orbital plane .",
    "it is shown that , if the disk is keplerian , full misalignment , i.e. @xmath318 , is reached in a time comparable to the precession period , which means that the solution for the system is no longer given algebraically .",
    "we should make resort to the solutions of the differential euler equations , a formidable task far beyond our goal in this paper .",
    "finally , for different disk models we have shown that the constraints on the density will hold as long as @xmath319 .",
    "in that situation , we have found the properties of the precessing region as a function of @xmath242 and @xmath320 .",
    "an expression for the separation distance between the primary and the secondary is also found . otherwise , if @xmath321 , lower bounds on the precession period and on the separation distance are found .",
    "these bounds depend on @xmath322 .",
    "application of this formalism to different disk models , may be summarized as follows : 1- for the keplerian thin @xmath232 standard disk model , the precession period ( in years ) will be      for accretion disks in binary systems , we may take the size of the disk as the truncation radius , the point where the roche equipotentials first intersect . in our systems",
    "we are not allowed to do so but , in any case , we found in the literature that values for @xmath324 are not unusual . besides , expecting precessiuon periods of about hundred years , the system will reach full misalignment in a time of the order of the precession period .",
    "the disk is not affected by constraints on the density .",
    "2- for disk in which radiation dominates pressure and cooling , if @xmath325 for a schwarzschild black hole and @xmath326 for a kerr black hole , density in the disk may come close to the critical density @xmath109 .",
    "in that situation , @xmath327 , and the size of the disk can not exceed          a reasonable value for @xmath85 would imply a very large ratio @xmath329 .",
    "we are , therefore , led to the suspicion that the assumption @xmath331 , or @xmath265 , is very strong for this model .",
    "abandon of this assumption leads to a lower bound on the precession period , given by          again , if the system is not to be affected by gravitational radiation , otherwise it will live for a short period of time , @xmath319 .",
    "if @xmath329 is not too large , @xmath334 , and the constraints on the density will not be effective . again",
