    "observing deuterated species is useful for probing the physical and chemical conditions of star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the deuterium to hydrogen ( d / h ) ratio in the local interstellar medium is low , about @xmath3 , which is the d / h elemental abundance as predicted by the nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "by contrast , higher molecular d / h ratios have been observed from objects associated with star formation , such as molecular clouds @xcite , pre - stellar cores @xcite , and protostellar cores @xcite .",
    "many observations and chemical models showed that deuterium - bearing molecules are enhanced during the cold prestellar core phase and released into the gas when a heating event , such as the formation of a protostar or the passage of a shock , evaporates the ice @xcite .",
    "formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) is one of the key species in the synthesis of more complex organic molecules .",
    "the h@xmath0co  lines are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and used to infer temperature and density of gas @xcite .",
    "there have been debates on the dominant formation mechanism of deuterated h@xmath0co : whether singly or doubly deuterated species ( hdco or d@xmath0co ) of formaldehyde form via active grain surface chemistry @xcite or gas - phase reactions @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated deuteration in the protostellar outflow shock of l1157-b1 .",
    "they concluded that the measured deuterium fractionation provides a fossil record of the gas before it was shocked by the jet driven by the protostar .",
    "they noted that the deuteration ratios derived from the outer part of the l1157 dense envelope ( l1157-b1 ) are smaller than the ratios derived from the iras 16293 - 2422 spectra which is close to the protostar , where the density is expected to be higher .",
    "recently , high resolution observations with a @xmath12@xmath2 resolution toward l1157-b1 showed that the emission of hdco was detected mostly from the region of interface between the ambient material and the shock driven by active outflow from a low - mass class 0 protostar l1157-mm @xcite .",
    "the deuterated fraction [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] of @xmath10.1 was measured in the hdco emitting region .",

    "they are colder than the typical class 0 protostars in orion .",
    "@xcite proposed that the pbrs may be the youngest protostars identified and characterized to date , with relatively high envelope densities .",
    "the pbrs are , therefore , ideal objects for investigating the earliest stage of protostellar evolution .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate whether the youngest class 0 objects , pbrs , are different from non - pbrs class 0 protostars , by comparing the deuterated levels of h@xmath0co .    in this paper , we report the observations of the selected protostars in the h@xmath0co  @xmath7  @xmath8 @xmath9  transition and the hdco  @xmath7  @xmath8 @xmath10  and @xmath11  transitions with two antennas of the korean very long baseline interferometry network ( kvn ) used in the single - dish mode .",

    "the optical depth of the h@xmath0co  line can be estimated by comparing the fluxes between h@xmath0co  and its isotopologue for the same transition .",
    "unfortunately , our survey did not cover observations of the h@xmath0@xmath65co line .",
    "though a direct measurement of the optical depth ( @xmath66 ) is not available , we have roughly estimated the line optical depths using the solution of the line radiative transfer equation . @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the peak temperature , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the equivalent rayleigh - jeans excitation and background temperatures , respectively .",
    "the optical depths estimated in this way are between 0.3 to 1.9 .",
    "in other studies , the optical depths of 0.41.1 were estimated from low - mass protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath11.6 from the dense core in the horsehead pdr @xcite , based on the flux ratio of the h@xmath0co  and h@xmath0@xmath65co @xmath9  transition .",
    "larger line width is also known to be coupled with larger line optical depth @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig_fwhm ] , we compare the line widths of h@xmath0co  @xmath9and hdco  @xmath10 .",
    "most sources with large h@xmath0co  line widths do not show a good agreement , which is likely due to the optical depth in the h@xmath0co  @xmath9  transition . considering the optical depth of the h@xmath0co  estimated from our calculation",
    ", the column density of h@xmath0coshould be corrected by a factor of @xmath71 , then @xmath72(h@xmath0co ) increases by a factor of 1.1 for @xmath73 and 2.2 for @xmath74 .",
    "the last column of table [ table_cd_ratio ] lists [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios calculated assuming @xmath28 = 10 k. this ratio is not very sensitive to @xmath28 ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratio ranges from 0.03 to 0.31 , which is consistent with values derived from the low - mass class 0 protostars by @xcite .",
    "the average [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratio and standard deviation of the total target sample are 0.105 and 0.075 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig_dh_hist](a ) shows the distribution of the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios for the full sample . considering that the ratio is always positive and that the distribution is asymmetric , the distribution can be characterized better with the mode than the average .",
    "the mode value and fwhm are @xmath10.07 and @xmath10.02 , respectively .",
    "the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios of the three pbrs on the high end ( 090003 , hops 373 , and 097002 ) are significantly larger than the mode value .",
    "they may represent either a long tail of a unimodal distribution or a secondary peak of a bimodal distribution .",
    "more extensive studies are necessary to understand the detailed shape of the distribution .",
    "figure [ fig_dh_hist](b ) shows the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] distributions for the pbrs and non - pbrs samples separately .",
    "about 30% of pbrs ( 3/11 ) have high [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios ( @xmath75 ) , and 70% of pbrs ( 8/11 ) have ratios similar to non - pbrs .",
    "both pbrs and non - pbrs have the same mode ( @xmath10.07 ) as the full sample",
    ".    since the number of non - pbrs sources are relatively small , the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios of class 0 sources measured by @xcite may be helpful in understanding the distributions .",
    "figure [ fig_dh_hist](c ) shows the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] distribution of non - pbrs sources , including 7 sources from @xcite .",
    "the general properties of the distribution remain the same .",
    "the mode is @xmath10.07 , and the range of values is less than @xmath10.12 , which reinforces the finding that the pbrs distribution has a relatively large dispersion and that the three pbrs on the high end are outliers .",
    "however , note that five sources in the sample of @xcite are in regions closer than the orion cloud , which could introduce some unexpected effects to the distribution",
    ". therefore , a more extensive survey with a larger sample size will be helpful in understanding the distributions better .",
    "figure [ fig_tau](a ) shows a comparison of the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios with and without optical depth correction . although the optical depth corrections for the h@xmath0co observations make the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios decrease for all sources , changes of the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios are not much . in figure [ fig_tau](b ) ,",
    "the overall distributions of the @xmath66-corrected [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios show similar characteristics compared with figure [ fig_dh_hist](b ) .",
    "the three outliers with high deuterium fractionation are still far from the mode of the distribution .",
    "even if we consider the optical depth , the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios of 090003 , hops 373 , and 097002 are still high ( @xmath76 0.15 ) .",
    "therefore , in the subsequent discussions below , we will consider only the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] distribution derived with the assumption of optically thin lines .",
    "the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios are plotted against @xmath77 and @xmath78 in figure [ fig_dh_tbol ] . when plotted against @xmath78 in figure [ fig_dh_tbol](b ) , no obvious correlation was found .",
    "the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios for low - mass class 0 protostars reported by @xcite are also plotted in figure [ fig_dh_tbol](a ) . as suggested by @xcite , there is no marked correlation between the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios and the bolometric temperature ( a proxy of the evolutionary stage of protostars ) .",
    "though the pbrs and non - pbrs samples show similar mode values , the pbrs sample shows a significantly larger scatter .",
    "this difference suggests that either pbrs have an intrinsically large variation in the deuterium fractionation or the three outliers are chemically distinct from the majority of class 0 protostars .      to focus on the large variation of the deuterium fractionation in the pbrs sample",
    ", we calculate the fractional abundances of the pbrs sample .",
    "the fractional hdco and h@xmath0co  abundances were calculated by dividing the total hdco and h@xmath0co  column densities by the h@xmath0 column density i.e. , x(hdco ) = [ hdco]/[h@xmath0 ] and x(h@xmath0co ) = [ h@xmath0co]/[h@xmath0 ] .",
    "using the 870  flux density in table 5 of @xcite , the beam - averaged column density of pbrs can be computed with : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the beam solid angle , @xmath53 is the mean molecular weight of the interstellar medium , which we assume to be 2.8 @xcite , @xmath82 is the mass of the hydrogen atom , @xmath83 is the dust absorption coefficient ( 1.85 @xmath84g@xmath18 , @xcite ) , and @xmath85 is the gas - to - dust mass ratio ( assumed to be 100 ) . we assume a dust temperature of 20 k @xcite .",
    "the observed abundances of hdco and h@xmath0co range from @xmath86 to @xmath87 and @xmath88 to @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "the h@xmath0co abundances of pbrs are similar to the outer h@xmath0co abundances toward low - mass protostars reported by @xcite .",
    "they have explained that the outer regions of the envelopes of class 0 sources reflect the pre - collapse conditions based on the similarity of the values between the abundances of pre - stellar cores studied by @xcite and the outer h@xmath0co  abundances of low - mass protostars .",
    "the hdco and h@xmath0co abundances relative to h@xmath0 are plotted in figure [ fig_xh2co_xhdco ] . as the h@xmath0co  abundance increases",
    ", the hdco abundance increases for the pbrs with the ratio of @xmath90 .",
    "the highly deuterated pbrs ( [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] @xmath76 0.15 ) are significantly different from the other pbrs in that they have small h@xmath0co  abundances and that their h@xmath0co  line widths are quite narrow ( @xmath91 1 km s@xmath18 , figure [ fig_fwhm ] ) .",
    "the degree of deuterium fractionation is suggested to increase with increasing co depletion @xcite .",
    "the co and h@xmath0co  molecules are depleted by a similar factor in the outer envelope of class 0 protostar @xcite . the low h@xmath0co  abundance of highly deuterated pbrs is likely to be explained by depletion of h@xmath0co .",
    "the narrow line widths imply that these cores are quiescent , which is associated with early phases of core evolution .",
    "therefore , the pbrs with high [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios are probably in the very earliest stage of star formation .",
    "figure [ fig_masslum_dh ] shows the relation between [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] and the mass - to - luminosity ratio that is expected to decrease with time .",
    "the pbrs with high [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios have relatively large mass - to - luminosity ratio , supporting that they are in the earliest stage of star formation . however , two pbrs with the largest mass - to - luminosity ratio have low [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios . therefore , it is difficult to find a simple relation between the two quantities .",
    "if the mass - to - luminosity ratio is a good tracer of evolution , [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] seems to have a large dispersion at early stages and converge to a typical value of class 0 sources at later stages .",
    "the large variation of deuterium fractionation in the whole pbrs sample leads us to suggest that the pbrs form in diverse conditions or have diverse formation histories .",
    "indeed , the degree of deuterium fractionation of h@xmath0co  is sensitive to the initial d / h ratios of gaseous molecules determined before the collapse phase @xcite .",
    "pbrs 097002 and 090003 among the highly deuterated pbrs have flat visibility amplitude profiles in the 2.9 mm dust continuum observations by @xcite .",
    "they interpret that the pbrs with flat visibility amplitude profiles are the youngest in a brief phase of high infall / accretion .",
    "since pbrs 093005 and 082005 with the lowest [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratio also have flat visibility amplitude profiles , it is unclear if the variation of deuterium fractionation in h@xmath0cois due to the core evolution .",
    "additional observations in pure gas phase species , e.g. , n@xmath0d@xmath92 and n@xmath0h@xmath92 , can help understanding the chemical evolutionary sequence of pbrs .",
    "we observed 15 class 0 protostars ( 11 pbrs and 4 non - pbrs ) in the orion molecular cloud complex using the kvn in the single - dish telescope mode .",
    "the chemical properties of pbrs were investigated in the h@xmath0co  @xmath9 , hdco  @xmath10 , and @xmath10  lines .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "the h@xmath0co  @xmath9  and hdco  @xmath10  emission lines were detected toward all targets .",
    "the hdco  @xmath11  emission line was detected toward seven pbrs .",
    "the [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratio ranges from 0.03 to 0.31 .",
    "the deuterium fractionation of most pbrs ( 70% ) is similar to that of non - pbrs class 0 protostars , and three pbrs ( 30% ) have significantly high deuterium fractionation , greater than 0.15 .",
    "these findings represent a good hint that the deuterium fractionation of pbrs may have a distribution different from that of non - pbrs , but future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to reach a statistically more significant conclusion .",
    "the high [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios of the three pbrs imply that they are in the earliest phase of the star formation .",
    "the large variation of deuterium fractionation in the whole pbrs sample suggests that pbrs form in diverse conditions of temperature and/or density , because [ hdco]/[h@xmath0co ] ratios are usually interpreted as a fossil memory of the earlier , colder phase of star formation .",
    "no clear correlation between the deuterium fractionation of h@xmath0co  and the evolutionary state of cores could be found .",
