    "since many years considerable effort has been made to investigate the problem of nucleation and growth of a new phase upon martensitic transformation . despite these attempts , there is no clear understanding so far of the atomic scale mechanism of the bcc - hcp reconstructive transformation occurring even in non - magnetic materials . in the case of",
    "fe - considered here - there are convincing arguments , both from theoretical and experimental side , that magnetism plays a crucial role for the stability of bcc structure , making the problem more complicated @xcite .",
    "the bcc - hcp transformation observed in non - magnetic materials has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the corresponding mechanism suggested by burgers @xcite consists in two types of simultaneous distortions ( see appendix , fig .",
    "[ fig_burgers ] ):",

    "the shear modulus is determined by the slope of the @xmath1 phonon branch @xmath8 $ ] with @xmath9 $ ] polarization .",
    "note that even for non - magnetic materials a phenomenological description of this type of martensitic transformation is not straightforward : as pointed out in the literature @xcite , the transition is discontinuous , having large critical displacements and no group - subgroup relationship between the symmetries of the initial and final phases .",
    "this causes problems for a landau free energy expansion with respect to an order parameter . to deal with first - order transitions",
    "the phenomenological landau theory was extended @xcite using two order parameters representing shuffle and shear deformations and have been applied rather successfully to the bcc - hcp phase transitions in ti @xcite and zr @xcite , associated with the softening of the @xmath0 point @xmath1 phonon mode . according to these theoretical findings , already small phonon softening ( as it takes place in the case of ti and zr )",
    "can be sufficient for a first order transformation @xcite .",
    "the theoretical approach used for non - magnetic systems has been applied to fe , showing the important role of magnetism .",
    "in contrast to the non - magnetic bcc metals mentioned above , no softening of the @xmath0 point phonon modes have been observed under pressure neither experimentally up to @xmath10 gpa @xcite nor theoretically @xcite .",
    "however , some dft based theoretical investigations report about the key role of the shear stress in fe under pressure for the bcc - hcp transition @xcite . their role has been investigated by sanati et al .",
    "@xcite in application to ti and zr showing that the bcc structure in these materials is completely stable with respect to shear deformation and only the @xmath0 point phonon mode is responsible for bcc - hcp transformation .",
    "ab - initio investigations by ekman et al .",
    "@xcite clearly showed that the stability of the bcc phase of fe is due to magnetic ordering .",
    "they have shown that the burgers type of lattice distortion results in the transition to the paramagnetic state at a certain amplitude of the atomic displacements and that way to the instability of the bcc structure .",
    "liu and johnson @xcite have analyzed the potential - energy surface and minimum - energy pathway obtained within ab - initio calculations and have also found that the magnetization collapse during the shuffle - shear ( burgers type ) deformation leads to the instability of the bcc phase of fe under pressure .    to investigate experimentally the role of magnetism in the bcc - hcp transformation , mathon et al .",
    "@xcite have performed measurements of near edge x - ray absorption ( xanes ) including a determination of the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) for fe under pressure .",
    "the high sensitivity of xmcd allows very precise measurements of the ordered magnetic moment on the absorber at the magnetic phase transition and to observe its correlation with the local geometrical structure monitored via xanes .",
    "the pressure dependence of the xmcd and xanes spectra around the transition pressure suggests that the magnetic transition slightly precedes the structural one .",
    "this finding allowed the authors to ascribe a leading role in the bcc - hcp transformation to the magnetic order in the system .",
    "nevertheless , this interrelation requires further clarification , because , in general , the vanishing of magnetism should lead immediately to the instability of the bcc state and therefore , no difference in the transition pressure deduced from xanes and xmcd spectra should be expected .",
    "although these results give information on the origin of the pressure induced instability of bcc fe and showing the minimal - energy pathway for the transition , there is still the question how the instability condition which needs a certain phonon softening under pressure occurs while no softening could be found .",
    "one possible way has been suggested by vul and harmon @xcite in their fluctuation - less mechanism for martensitic transformations triggered by the defects presented in the crystal . in the present work",
    "we analyze the conditions which can result in the instability in perfect bcc fe via lattice fluctuations , in particular the effect of temperature induced spin fluctuations for the bcc - hcp transition .",
    "these investigations in particular give an answer to the question , why the decrease of the xmcd signal slightly precedes that of the xanes signal corresponding to bcc structure upon a pressure increase .",
    "spin - polarized electronic structure calculations have been performed using the spin - polarized kkr ( korringa - kohn - rostoker ) green s function method @xcite in the fully relativistic approach .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for density functional theory was used with the exchange - correlation potential due to perdew , burke , ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite .",
