    "dynamical galactic models serve a variety of purposes .",
    "they may be used to interpret the structural and kinematical observables of galaxies  surface brightness profiles , rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles  in terms of intrinsic three - dimensional density and velocity distributions .",
    "dynamical models also provide a starting point for controlled simulations of complicated processes such as the formation of bars and spiral structure . in short , galactic",
    "modeling provides the essential interface between observations and detailed theories of galaxy formation . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new dynamical model for late - type galaxies which comprises a disk , bulge , and dark halo .",
    "the model is derived from equilibrium solutions to the collisionless boltzmann and poisson equations .",
    "it extremely flexible and may be tailored to satisfy observational data and theoretical constraints .",
    "we use bayesian statistics and the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to implement these constraints and to determine the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the model in the full multi - dimensional parameter space .",
    "our model builds upon earlier work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the original kuijken & dubinski model consists of an exponential disk , a king - model bulge , and a lowered evans - model halo and has the attractive feature that the phase space distribution function ( df ) is built from analytic functions of the integrals of motion .",
    "no additional assumptions about the velocity - space distribution are made . by contrast , the widely - used approach described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) assumes that the local velocity distributions of the halo and bulge particles are gaussian with dispersions estimated from the jeans equations .",
    "this approach leads to models which are slighly out of equilibrium . when used as initial conditions in n - body experiments , they readjust to a different state from the one proposed ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two main disadvantages of the kuijken and dubinski models .",
    "first , the bulge and halo have constant density ( or weakly cuspy ) centers whereas actual bulges and dark halos may have central density cusps .",
    "second , the structure of the bulge and halo are determined _ implicitly _ by the model parameters .",
    "( by construction , the disk s structural parameters , namely its radial and vertical scale lengths , its mass , and its truncation radius , are determined explicitly by the model parameters . )",
    "@xcite built a galactic model with @xmath5-density cusps for both the bulge and halo but again , with a df that determines the structure of the bulge and halo implicitly .    for our new model",
    ", the closed - form df is abandoned in favor of a numerical df which is designed to yield , to a very good approximation , user - specified density profiles for the bulge and halo .",
    "that is , the density profiles of the bulge and halo are now _ explicit _ functions of the model parameters .",
    "the present version of the model allows for a sersic bulge and a halo with @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "our model is specified in terms of fifteen or so parameters .",
    "how are these parameters selected ?",
    "one approach is to choose models at random and identify the ones that satisfy certain general constraints ( e.g. , the tully - fisher and size - luminosity relations ) .",
    "the result would be a catalog of disk - bulge - halo systems which could be used to study kinematical and dynamical trends such as the circular speed - central velocity dispersion ( @xmath11 ) relation ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a catalog of this type could also be used for n - body studies of mergers or interactions between galaxies in a cosmological environment . a second approach , and the one pursued here , is to build models for specific galaxies .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we use the milky way as our illustrative example .    modeling the milky way",
    "is a time - honoured endeavor ; notable examples include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our construction of dynamical milky way models is in the spirit of the mass model survey by @xcite .",
    "their models comprise a multi - component disk , a bulge , and a halo and are characterized by ten parameters .",
    "twenty - two examples are presented , each the result of a maximum likelihood analysis in which some parameters are held fixed while others are allowed to vary .",
    "the dehnen & binney likelihood function is constructed by comparing model predictions with six sets of observational data : the inner and outer galactic rotation curves , the oort constants , the mass at large radii , the local vertical force , and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion in baade s window .",
    "the advantage of our models is that they not only describe the potential - density pair for the galaxy but also , the underlying df .",
    "we therefore have the ability to examine the stability of our galactic models using n - body simulations , an issue that is often ignored ( but see @xcite and @xcite ) .    for the most part , we adopt dehnen & binney s choice of observational data though we include more complete observations of the line - of - sight dispersion in the bulge region as well as photometric data from the cobe satellite .",
    "we also present what we believe to be a more balanced treatment of the likelihood function .",
    "most significantly , we bring to the problem the powerful tools of bayesian statistics and mcmc . these tools allow us to map out pdfs of both input parameters and derived quantities .    though our model represents an axisymmetric , equilibrium system , it is susceptible to non - axisymmetric instabilities and therefore provides a natural starting point for numerical studies of galactic dynamics .",
    "an n - body realization of the model can be easily generated from the df and then used as the initial conditions for a numerical simulation .",
    "the milky way models in our mcmc series all satisfy the observational constraints but vary considerably in their structural properties .",
    "we simulate a selection of twenty - five models which span a wide range in toomre @xmath1 @xcite and goldreich - tremaine @xmath2 @xcite parameters and find that a bar develops in virtually all of the cases .",
    "the onset of the bar instability can occur immediately or after several gyr , depending on the model .",
    "we present the model in section 2 , review the observational constraints in section 3 , and provide a summary of the essentials of bayesian statistics and the mcmc method in section 4 .",
    "we discuss some preliminaries including our choice of prior probabilities , in section 5 .",
    "we present the results of our mcmc analysis in section 6 and the results of our bar formation simulations in section 7 . in section 8",
    "we summarize our main conclusions and speculate on how we might improve upon and extend the models and mcmc analysis .",
    "we consider axisymmetric , collisionless systems whose df is of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the relative energy , @xmath14 is the angular momentum about the symmetry axis , and @xmath15 is the energy associated with vertical motions of stars in the disk @xcite . for time - independent , axisymmetric systems @xmath16 and @xmath14 are integrals of motion while @xmath15 is an approximate integral of motion for disk stars on nearly circular orbits .",
    "jeans theorem implies that a system generated by equation [ eq : totaldf ] will be in approximate equilibrium .",
    "integrating equation[eq : totaldf ] over all velocities yields the density in terms of the gravitational potential , @xmath17 , and the cylindrical coordinates @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the relative potential .",
    "( note that implicit in equation [ eq : totaldf ] is the assumption that the bulge and halo velocity dispersions are isotropic . )",
    "self - consistency requires that @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy poisson s equation @xmath24 which is accomplished , in practice , through an iterative scheme .",
    "( note that here and throughout , we set newton s constant @xmath25 . )",
    "@xcite chose @xmath26 to be the king model df @xcite and @xmath27 to be the lowered evans model df from @xcite .",
    "( the latter depends on @xmath14 as well as @xmath28 thereby allowing for flattened halos . )",
    "their models have two main shortcomings .",
    "first , bulges and halos may have central density cusps whereas the king and lowered - evans dfs yield density profiles with constant - density cores .",
    "second , the relationship between the model parameters and the density profiles of the bulge and halo is implicit rather than explicit and not particularly intuitive .",
    "@xcite built galactic models with cuspy ( @xmath29 as @xmath7 ) bulges and halos . specifically , they chose the @xcite df for the bulge and a df from @xcite for the halo .",
    "the latter was constructed to yield the so - called nfw profile @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "@xcite altered these dfs in an attempt to account for the gravitational potential of the other components though the modifications were somewhat _",
    "ad hoc_. consequently , the density profile of the halo differed from the nfw profile and likewise for the bulge .    a further drawback of the @xcite model is that the hernquist bulge and nfw halo are arguably too restrictive . the hernquist df yields a system whose surface density profile is well approximated by the @xmath31-law @xcite .",
    "the bulges of late - type galaxies are found to have surface brightness profiles which follow the more general sersic law , @xmath32 with sersic index @xmath33 between @xmath34 and @xmath10 @xcite . likewise , dark matter halos may have density profiles more general than the nfw form . since the work of @xcite , there has been considerable debate over the actual form of halo density profiles .",
    "@xcite find evidence in their simulations for steeper cusps ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite conclude that the logarithmic slope of the halo density profiles decreases steadily with radius though their results are still consistent with equation [ eq : nfwprofile ] . on the observational front",
    ", the rotation curves of dark matter - dominated low surface brightness galaxies appear to favour constant density cores @xcite though this interpretation of the data is being challenged on a number of fronts .    for our new models , we begin by choosing target density profiles , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for the bulge and halo .",
    "assume , for the moment , that the system is spherically symmetric .",
    "through the abel integral transform , @xmath38 @xcite , we can construct bulge and halo dfs which yield the target density profiles . in the case of an isolated halo or bulge",
    ", @xmath39 is the potential derived from @xmath40 or @xmath41 and equation[eq : abel ] reduces to the usual expression for the df of a spherically symmetric system with isotropic velocities .",
    "the df for a system following the sersic law was found with this method by @xcite .",
    "dfs for nfw halos were found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for a composite system or one with an external potential ,",
    "one simply replaces the @xmath23 derived from @xmath42 with the total gravitational potential .",
    "@xcite used this method to derive dfs for bulges with central black holes by setting @xmath43 .",
    "equation[eq : abel ] is only valid for spherically symmetric systems , a condition violated once a disk is included .",
    "our approach is to use a spherical approximation ( essentially , the monopole term of a spherical harmonics expansion ) for the disk potential in evaluating @xmath39 .",
    "we stress that equation[eq : abel ] is used to construct @xmath44 and @xmath45 , not to solve for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we can use @xmath44 and @xmath45 in equation [ eq : totaldf ] even though the composite system is not spherically symmetric ; a df of the form @xmath48 yields an equilibrium system in _ any _ time - independent potential regardless of the spatial symmetries of the potential . the bulge and halo of the final model are axisymmetric ( but not spherically symmetric ) since isodensity surfaces follow isopotential surfaces ( equation [ eq : totalrho ] ) , the latter being flattened by the disk . as we demonstrate below , the spherically - averaged density profiles of the bulge and halo are very close to the target profiles .",
    "we choose the target density profile for the bulge to be @xmath49 which yields the sersic law ( equation [ eq : sersic ] ) for the projected surface density profile provided one sets @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "note that here and in equation [ eq : sersic ] , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath33 are free parameters while the constant @xmath53 is adjusted so that @xmath52 encloses half the total projected light or mass . in our models ,",
    "we use @xmath54 rather than @xmath55 to parametrize the overall density scale of the bulge models . with this definition",
    ", @xmath56 corresponds to the depth of the gravitational potential associated with the bulge .",
    "we choose the target density profile of the halo to be @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a truncation function that smoothly goes from unity to zero at @xmath59 over a width @xmath60 .",
    "we use the function @xmath61 the halo profile is therefore characterized by five parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath60 , the halo scale length , @xmath63 , the velocity scale , @xmath64 , and the central `` cusp strength '' , @xmath8 . for @xmath65 , the mass interior to radius @xmath66 is given by    @xmath67    following @xcite , we adjust the disk s df so that its space density falls off approximately exponentially in @xmath18 and as @xmath68 in @xmath19 with radial and vertical scale lengths @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively",
    ". the disk is truncated at a radius @xmath71 with a truncation sharpness parameter @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , we choose a df where the radial dispersion profile is approximately exponential : @xmath73 for simplicity , we set @xmath74 in accord with observations by @xcite .",
    "we use nine sets of observational data as constraints on our milky way models .",
    "five of these data sets  the inner and outer rotation curves , the oort constants , the vertical force in the solar neighborhood , and the total mass at large radii  are largely taken from @xcite and references therein .",

    "two effects , one numerical and one physical , can lead to bar formation in the presense of an initial ilr .",

    "( recall that in some models , the radius of the ilr can be as small as @xmath310 . ) as the central halo relaxes , the peak of the @xmath311-curve can drop below the initial pattern speed .",

    ", explanation is that swing amplified spiral waves disturb the central region of the galaxy causing the ilr barrier to disappear , at least temporarily .",

    "we see that the surface density profiles of models with low values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dramatically deformed ; the redistribution of mass is so violent that the models almost certainly do not satisfy our observational constraints . on the other hand , models where the bar forms relatively late in the simulation show little evolution of the surface density profile .",

    "( previous analyses side - stepped this issue by using a spherically symmetric galactic potential . )",
    "our mcmc analysis provides an ideal starting point for studies of disk stability and bar formation in that we have some @xmath0 models , each of which can serve as initial conditions for a numerical experiment .",
