    "in strongly correlated electron systems , including high - transition temperature ( high-@xmath0 ) superconductors , the electric and magnetic behavior at the phase boundary between antiferromagnetic ( af ) and superconducting ( sc ) phases has attracted significant research interest . in iron - based high-@xmath0 pnictides ,",
    "the af state is a stripe - type spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state @xmath3 arising from interband nesting between hole and electron pockets , and the relationship between af and sc states is deeply connected with the pairing symmetry .",
    "some theoretical investigations predict that sdw and sc order parameters are compatible near the phase boundary @xmath4 , and the homogeneous coexistence of sdw and sc states is possible for superconductors with s@xmath5 symmetry @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , this coexistence is experimentally suggested for compounds that exhibit the crossover regime such as ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath7)@xmath8as@xmath8 ( ba122 series ) @xmath9 , which is a representative high-@xmath0 pnictide , or cafe@xmath1co@xmath2asf",

    "@xmath11 , which is a prototype of high-@xmath0 pnictides , sdw and sc phases are segregated in the phase diagram , although the crossover regime apparently exists in other @xmath121111 series ( @xmath12 = ce , nd , sm , etc . ) in which the highest @xmath0 is for the sm1111 series @xmath13 .",
    "the conditions in which phase segregation or homogeneous coexistence appear remain to be elucidated for a variety of pnictides .",
    "starting from the la1111 series , an empirical and systematic understanding is possible , which should aid in addressing this question .",

    "is attainable not by mechanical approaches , but by chemical approaches .",
    "the ba122 and ca1111 series are good examples of what can be attained by chemical approaches : the distance between feas planes is 0.65 and 0.8593 nm for the ba122 @xmath16 and ca1111 @xmath17 series , respectively , while that for the la1111 series is 0.8739 nm @xmath11 . with increasing uniaxial compression , ( i.e. decreasing the distance between feas planes ) ,",

    "in fact , at 3.0 gpa , the la1111 series is nearly equivalent to the ce1111 series @xmath19 in that the lattice constants are almost the same and the maximum @xmath0 is about 40 k. pressure application or rare earth replacement induces the overlap and shifts the maximum @xmath0 away from the phase boundary .",

    "a pressure of 3.0 gpa was applied by using a conventional clump - type pressure cell . before discussing the 2.6% doped samples , we show nmr spectra for the undoped samples measured at 35.1 mhz .",
    "figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show the spectra at ambient pressure and at 3.0 gpa , respectively . at high temperatures , the broad signal around 40 koe and the sharper peak around 46 koe",
    "correspond to the transitions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the sharper peak is split into a double - peak structure because of the second - order quadrupole effect .",
    "the signal corresponding to the transition , @xmath32 appeared at higher fields around 53 koe , making a symmetric powder pattern .",
    "however , the latter broad signal overlaps the @xmath33la nmr signal ; therefore , throughout this article , we discuss only the broad lower - field signal and the double peaks . for the af phase at low temperatures , the double - peak structure disappears and the signal corresponding to @xmath31 is distributed in a wide field region because the internal fields arising from the af ordering affect the resonance position .",
    "intriguingly , the paramagnetic - metal ( pm ) state survives even below af transition temperatures @xmath28 ( @xmath34 140 and 125 k at ambient pressure and 3.0 gpa , respectively ) , implying that a supercooling state is realized in these powder samples .",

    "the nmr spectra are qualitatively the same as the undoped spectra . at low temperatures below @xmath28 ( @xmath34 100 and 80 k at ambient pressure and 3.0 gpa ,",
    "respectively ) , the nmr spectra consist of two components : the broad signal originating from the af state , and central bumps originating from the pm state as highlighted in figs .",
    "3(b ) and 3(e ) .",
    "the central bumps are robust because they survive even at 10 k [ see fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , implying the occurrence of phase segregation or domain formation . at 3.0 gpa ,",
    "pm domains become superconducting at low temperatures as seen from the detuning of the nmr tank circuit [ see fig .",
    "the detuning measured at 45.1 mhz indicates a @xmath0 value of 18k .",
    "therefore , at 3.0 gpa , sc and af phases become segregated on a microscopic level , although af and sc phases apparently overlap in the phase diagram [ see fig .",
    "the phase segregation between the af and sc phases has been observed even for a doping level of 5.5% by mean of muon - spin rotation ( @xmath36sr ) , and pressure application causes an increase in the sc volume fraction against the af volume fraction .",
    "@xmath37 interestingly , at ambient pressure the absence of the detuning as shown in fig .",
    "3 ( f ) indicates that phase segregation between af and pm phases occurs , which is not expected from the existing phase diagram that indicates the af phase at the 2.6% doping level .",
    "the existence of the pm phase is the most important result from the present experiments and raises fundamental doubts about the existing paradigm that focuses only on the relationship between sc and af states",
    ". why does the pm phase occur at the doping level where the af phase is expected in the existing diagram ?",
    "the answer is deeply connected with the size of pm domains , which are not macroscopic but on the scale of several lattice units . at a doping level of 2.6% ,",
    "the pm domains are so small that some experimental techniques may not detect them .",
    "this assertion is supported by the fact that the relaxation rates ( @xmath38 ) has a maximum at @xmath28 reflecting af fluctuations from neighboring af domains [ see fig .",
    "4(b ) ] . note that pm domains are due to neither a nonuniform charge distribution nor some second phase .",
    "the former possibility is ruled out because domains with excess charge carriers would be not in a pm state but in a sc state .",

    "the phase segregation between pm and af phases can not be explained by the existing paradigm : to understand the phenomenon together with the phase segregation between sc and af phases at high pressure , two factors should be considered : ( i ) the growth of pm domains due to increasing electron doping level as illustrated in fig .",

    "a in figs .",
    "5(b ) ] , pm domains are maintained , even below @xmath28 , as isolated seeds because of supercooling ; however , they finally disappear at low temperatures . therefore , the ground state is the af state , which is consistent with existing observations . in the intermediate - doping regime [ regime b in fig .",
    "5(b ) ] , pm domains grow with increasing doping level and become robust even at low temperatures , causing phase segregation with af domains . whether the ground state is a sc or pm state depends on the location of the onset of superconductivity .",
    "the onset , which is at @xmath34 3.5% doping level at ambient pressure [ see fig .",
    "5(b ) ] , shifts to the underdoped regime upon applying pressure and crosses the 2.6% doping level at 3.0 gpa . therefore ,",
    "two kinds of segregation are possible depending on pressure . in the intermediate - doping regime , applying pressure would not change the size of pm domains if one considers the nmr spectral intensity shown in fig .",
    "taking account of a bulk volume fraction , pm domains would somehow link with neighboring pm domains , unlike in the underdoped regime . in the overdoped regime [ region",
    "5(b ) ] , pm domains cover the entire system and exhibit superconducting properties at low temperatures , independent of pressure application .",
    "the pm state is free from af , ( i.e. , sdw ) ordering , implying that a factor other than interband nesting is crucial .",
    "recently , a ferroquadrupole ( fq ) ordering state between sdw and s@xmath40 sc states has been suggested based on orbital fluctuation theory . @xmath41 a phase diagram based on the theory is shown in fig .",
    "af and pm domains in the central panel of fig .",
    "5(a ) correspond to different doping levels indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "pm domains at ambient pressure would be in the fq ordering phase , while they become superconducting at 3.0 gpa because the sc phase boundary shifts to the underdoped regime by applying pressure .",
    "the electronic phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) allows us to reproduce the phase diagram in fig .",
    "1 because the volume fraction of af domains is predominant around the phase boundary and therefore the contribution from af domains is apparently emphasized for some experimental techniques .",
    "in conclusion , we have observed phase segregation between af and pm domains at ambient pressure in the la1111 series by using @xmath20as nmr . by increasing the electron doping level , we observed growth of pm domains accompanied by the onset of superconductivity .",
    "the pm state is independent of the af ordering that arises from interband nesting , suggesting that the existing paradigm that focuses only on the relationship between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism is not valid .",
    "the fq state predicted by orbital fluctuation theory is a leading candidate to explain the anomalous pm domains .",
