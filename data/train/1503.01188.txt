    "throughout this paper , we consider oriented legendrian knots in @xmath0 with the standard tight contact structure @xmath1 .    a legendrian knot theory is the study of legendrian knots up to legendrian isotopy",
    "which is much more restricted compared to the smooth or piecewise - linear isotopy in the classical knot theory .",
    "more precisely , by considering the ambient space as the one - point compactification of @xmath2 and taking a suitable projection , these two theories are differ by whether _ positive and negative ( de)stabilizations _ are allowed or not .",
    "therefore for given topological knot type @xmath3 , there are infinitely many inequivalent lengendrian isotopy classes of topological knot type @xmath3 , and we denote by @xmath4 the set of legendrian isotopy classes of @xmath3 .",
    "there are two well - known legendrian knot invariants , _ thurston - bennequin number @xmath5 _ and _ rotation number @xmath6 _ that can be used to classify legendrian knots in @xmath4 , and they are called _ classical invariants_. refer to @xcite for details . then a topological knot type @xmath3 is said to be _ legendrian simple",
    "_ if legendrian knots in @xmath4 are classified by the classical invariants .",
    "the legendrian simplicity for unknot has been shown by eliashberg and fraser in 1995 @xcite , and for figure - eight and torus knots by etnyre and honda in 2001 @xcite . especially , etnyre and honda in their followed paper @xcite provided a complete combinatorial description for the connected sum of legendrian knots , and proved that the legendrian simplicity is not closed under the connected sum .",
    "on the other hand , they also proved in @xcite that the cabling operation preserves the legendrian simplicity under the _ uniform thickness property _ ( utp ) .",
    "the important benifits of ( utp ) are that it will be preserved not only by cabling with the certain condition , but also by the connected sum . hence ,",
    "if started with legendrian simple and utp knot , one may produce the arbitrarily many legendrian simple knots by the iterated cabling as studied in @xcite .",
    "however , as seen above , the legendrian simplicity may not be preserved under connected sum , and therefore the attempt of cabling after connected sum may fail .",
    "this paper provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for the connected sum to be legendrian simple as follows .",
    "[ thm : criterion ] let @xmath7 be a connected sum decomposition of @xmath3 with pairwise distinct prime knots .",

    "@xmath190 and @xmath225 , and therefore only possibility is that @xmath226 .",
    "however this is not possible either because the regions where @xmath143 s are lying are separated by lines @xmath227 . therefore @xmath228 and @xmath229 are different but share the classical invariants . hence @xmath166 is not legendrian simple .",
    "suppose @xmath230 , that is , @xmath4 has the greatest element @xmath23 and all legendrian knots in @xmath4 are of the form @xmath231 .",
    "moreover , these stabilizations can be relocated freely among the connected summands .",
    "hence any legendrian knot in @xmath137 is equivalent to @xmath232 for some @xmath233 , and its @xmath34 and @xmath40 determine @xmath234 and @xmath235 uniquely .",
    "therefore @xmath79 is legendrian simple .        as before , all legendrian knots in @xmath4",
    "are of the form either @xmath242 or @xmath243 , and any legendrian knot @xmath23 in @xmath137 is equivalent to @xmath244 for @xmath245 .",
    "we simply denote this by @xmath246 .",
    "then for @xmath247 ,",
    "@xmath248 @xmath249            conversely , the same result holds for @xmath267 by changing the roles of @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "therefore the classical invariants determine exactly one legendrian knot in @xmath137 , and so @xmath166 is legendrian simple .",
    "suppose @xmath270 , or @xmath271 for all @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath272 and @xmath201 be two stabilizations of @xmath200 such that @xmath273",
    ". then @xmath274 and @xmath275 are different by the essentially same argument as before and by lemma  [ lem : paths2 ] .",
    "therefore @xmath276 is not legendrian simple .",
    "suppose @xmath171 , and let @xmath23 be the unique maximal element of @xmath277 .",
    "then as before , all legendrian knots in @xmath277 are of the form @xmath231 , and so any legendrian knot in @xmath92 is equivalent to @xmath278 for some @xmath279 by moving all stabilizations to the second summand .",
    "therefore , the classical invariants for @xmath280 determine not only the classical invariants for @xmath211 , but also @xmath211 itself since @xmath84 is legendrian simple .",
    "this implies the legendrian simplicity for @xmath276 .",
