    "the fragmentation and ionization of d@xmath1 by intense optical laser fields has been an active area of theoretical and experimental studies during the past decades @xcite . in most of these experiments",
    "it was assumed that the d@xmath1 molecule is ionized in the early phase of the laser field producing d@xmath0 ion which is subsequently ionized by the laser .",
    "mechanisms for the ionization of d@xmath0 ion include bond softening ( so ) @xcite , charge resonance enhanced ionization ( crei ) @xcite , in addition to direct ionization by the laser field .",
    "the dissociation and ionization of d@xmath0 in the laser field result in d@xmath2 + d or d@xmath2 + d@xmath2 , with characteristic kinetic energies reflecting the internuclear separation of the breakup of d@xmath0 at the time when it is excited or ionized .",
    "thus bond softening and crei , which produce distinct peaks in the d@xmath2 ion kinetic energy spectra have been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically .",
    "these peaks can be understood without reference to the ionization of d@xmath1 itself initially , i.e. , the ionization of d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 can be treated as two independent events .",
    "however , recent experiments @xcite pointed out a new group of peaks in the d@xmath2 ion spectra at the higher energy ( about 5 ev to 10 ev per ion ) which has now been attributed to the rescattering process . in the rescattering process , the electron which is released by tunneling ionization",
    "is driven back by the laser field to collide with the residual d@xmath0 ion to ionize it or to excite it . if the d@xmath0 ion is excited , it can dissociate directly or be further ionized by the laser . in both cases ,",
    "the d@xmath2 ion will have kinetic energy ( the reflection principle ) characteristic of the internuclear separation where the ionization occurs .",
    "this paper is to examine all the elementary processes that lead to the emission of d@xmath2 ions by the rescattering process following the initial tunneling ionization of the d@xmath1 molecule .",
    "the calculation will be performed for d@xmath1 molecules only , but clearly the same model can be applied to h@xmath1 with minor modifications .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we first discuss all the elementary processes that lead to the dissociation or ionization of d@xmath1 molecules in a laser field .",
    "starting with the tunneling ionization of d@xmath1 , we address the following issues : ( 1 ) calculation of the ionization rates of d@xmath1 from its equilibrium distance using the molecular tunneling ionization ( mo - adk ) theory @xcite ; ( 2 ) the classical trajectory of the ionized electron in the laser field and the coulomb field of the d@xmath0 ion , with initial longitudinal and transverse velocity distributions following the description of the adk theory @xcite ; ( 3 ) the free propagation and spreading of the nuclear wave packet after the tunneling ionization of d@xmath1 from its equilibrium distance ; ( 4 ) semi - empirical formulae for electron impact excitation cross sections of d@xmath0 from the @xmath3 ground state to the first few excited electronic states , in particular , the first @xmath4 and @xmath5 states .",
    "these cross sections have to be evaluated at all values of internuclear separations and for different alignment angles of d@xmath0 with respect to the laser polarization direction ; ( 5 ) evaluation of tunneling ionization rates of d@xmath0 from the excited @xmath4 and @xmath5 states at each internuclear separation ; ( 6 ) follow the time evolution of dissociation and ionization dynamics to extract the kinetic energy spectra of the fragmentation products .",
    "while rates or cross sections for each of these elementary processes have been formulated , in the full calculation we only consider d@xmath1 initially aligned perpendicular to the direction of the laser polarization . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the resulting kinetic energy spectra of d@xmath2 are compared to the experiment of niikura _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite where d@xmath2 ions were detected without knowing whether the other fragmentation product is a d or a d@xmath2 . in contradiction to the conclusion of this work where the main peak in the d@xmath2 kinetic energy spectrum was attributed to the dissociation of d@xmath0 following excitation to the @xmath4 electronic state , we conclude from our calculation that the main peak is due to the further ionization of the excited d@xmath0 by the laser .",
    "this has the consequence that the molecular clock we read is at a different time from the one read in niikura _",
    "we further analyzed the contributions of the total kinetic energy spectra of d@xmath2 resulting from the different excited electronic states , from dissociation or ionization , and from rescattering at the first return , the third return , or higher returns .",
    "the simulated d@xmath2 kinetic energy spectra from ionization also were compared to the recent experiment of alnaser _",
    "_ @xcite . from our analysis",
    ", we conclude that the fragmentation of d@xmath1 can be used as a molecular clock based on the rescattering dynamics .",
    "the clock can be read more accurately if the laser pulse is chosen at the lower intensity and with a shorter duration .",
    "with such a clock , the time duration can be read with an accuracy of fraction of a femtosecond without the attosecond laser pulses .",
    "equivalently this means that the distance between the two nuclei can be read with an accuracy of fractions of an angstrom .",
    "this can be achieved experimentally by comparing kinetic energy spectra for experiments carried out at different mean laser wavelengths , or by comparing the kinetic energy spectra of d@xmath2 and h@xmath2 from the fragmentation of d@xmath1 and h@xmath1 , respectively , in the same laser pulse .",

    "the excited d@xmath0 can dissociate along these repulsive potential curves , or further ionized by the laser to produce d@xmath2 ions by coulomb explosion , to produce characteristic kinetic energy spectra of the fragments . for more detailed description ,",
    "see text.,height=336 ]    the d@xmath1 molecule is first ionized at t@xmath6 near the peak of the laser pulse , releasing an electron into the oscillating laser field . at t@xmath7",
    ", the electron is driven back to the molecular ion , to excite the other electron in the ion to one of the higher excited electronic states , or to ionize it .",
    "we will be dealing with peak laser intensities such that the returning electron does not have enough energy to ionize d@xmath0 . in the meanwhile ,",
    "the nuclear wave packet propagates from its mean internuclear distance r@xmath6=1.4 a.u . at t@xmath6",
    "to r@xmath7=1.6 a.u at t@xmath7 .",
    "thus the electron impact excitation probabilities of the molecular ion by the returning electron have to be calculated for d@xmath0 with a vibrational distribution @xmath8 .",
    "this distribution is indicated in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : sch ] .",
    "once the d@xmath0 is in the excited state , represented by the curve labelled @xmath4 and @xmath5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch ] , the d@xmath0 can dissociate directly to d@xmath2 + d , or it can be further ionized by the laser at t@xmath9 when the electric field of the laser returns to its peak value .",
    "if the d@xmath0 is ionized at t@xmath9 , then it will fragment by coulomb explosion to produce d@xmath2 + d@xmath2 ions .",
    "the total released kinetic energy for such a `` two - step '' process can be calculated .",
    "the rescattering does not have to occur only at the first return time t@xmath7 . due to the attractive field from the molecular ion ,",
    "the released electron can return to collide with the molecular ion at later times , i.e. , after more than one optical cycle , following the initial ionization .",
    "for example , the return can occur at t@xmath1 and t@xmath10 , in the second optical cycle , or at t@xmath11 and t@xmath12 , in the third optical cycle , and so on . at these",
    "later times excitation and ionization occur at larger internuclear separations , thus the kinetic energies of the fragmented d@xmath2 ion are smaller . in general",
    "the returning probabilities become small after three optical cycles . following the general convention",
    "we call t@xmath1 the second return and t@xmath10 the third return , etc ...    an important feature of the elementary processes described above is that the rescattering times t@xmath13 and the subsequent tunneling ionization time t@xmath14 are relatively well locked to the clock t@xmath6 of the initial ionization of d@xmath1 . since",
    "tunneling ionization occurs only near the peak of the laser field , t@xmath6 spans only a fraction of an optical cycle .",
    "similarly , t@xmath13 and t@xmath14 are also restricted to within sub - fs accuracy .",
    "these precise clocks in turn define precise internuclear separations . for laser pulses with mean wavelength at 800 nm , the mean internuclear distances r@xmath13 for t@xmath13 ( i=1,3,5,7 ) are shown in table  [ tab : return ] for h@xmath1 and d@xmath1 .",
    "note that at t@xmath15 , the center of the vibrational wave packet for h@xmath0 has already bounced back from the outer turning point , but not so for d@xmath0 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the clock or the mean internuclear separation can be probed directly by the characteristic kinetic energy peaks of the fragmented d@xmath2 ions .",
    "changing the wavelength of the laser clearly will change the clocks and the mean internuclear separations . replacing d@xmath1 by h@xmath1 will not change the clock but will change the mean internuclear distances .    to read the clock from the measured kinetic energy of the fragmented ion , however , there are a number of factors that make the clock `` fuzzy '' .",
    "first , the initial tunneling ionization occurs over an interval of about 0.3 fs near the peak of the laser field .",
    "the initial vibrational wave packet , taken to be the ground vibrational wavefunction of d@xmath1 , according to the frank - condon principle , has a width of 0.2 nm",
    ". this vibrational wave packet will broaden as it expands to larger internuclear separation .",
    "the electron impact excitation probabilities and the mo - adk rates also depend on internuclear separations",
    ". these factors would reduce the precision of the clock such that distinct peaks in the kinetic energy distribution of the fragmented ions are not as clearly separated .",
    "we model the rescattering process to check how accurately the molecular clock can be read from the kinetic energy spectra of the fragmented ions for different laser parameters .",
    "we now describe the models used for calculating the rates and probabilities for each elementary process .",
    "we first discuss how the ionization rates of d@xmath1 and d@xmath0 in the laser fields are calculated . from the rescattering model above , we need the ionization rates for d@xmath1 from the ground state , and for d@xmath0 from the excited @xmath4 and @xmath5 states over the whole range of r. the rates are needed for different alignment of the molecules as well .",
    "we calculated the tunneling ionization rates using the recently developed mo - adk model @xcite .",
    "it was obtained by extending the widely used adk @xcite theory for atoms in a laser field to molecules . in the mo - adk theory",
