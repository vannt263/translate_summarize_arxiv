    "the exact wavefunction for the @xmath2-particle non - relativistic electronic schrdinger equation can be expressed as an expansion of slater determinants which span a complete @xmath2-electron space in which the problem is posed .",
    "these slater determinants , in turn , are comprised of the antisymmetrized products of spin orbitals , the set of which form a complete one - electron space . in general , however , neither the complete @xmath2-electron space , nor the complete one - particle space can be represented exactly and unavoidably we must make do with @xmath1 spin orbitals , and , at most , the corresponding @xmath3 determinants in the @xmath2-electron fock space that these spin orbitals can construct .    even within this finite set of determinants ,",
    "it is extraordinarily difficult to construct exact solutions and in practice one has to resort to approximate theories which in quantum chemistry form the set of standard models@xcite .",
    "these range from the single slater determinant used in hartree - fock theory to the variationally optimised linear combination of the full set of slater determinants found by full configuration interaction ( fci)@xcite . the coupled - cluster and many - body perturbation series form two distinct hierarchies .",
    "the ground state energy retrieved by fci is the variationally lowest that can be achieved from this one - electron basis , within the wavefunction anstze prescribed , and so is often termed the exact solution in this basis .",
    "however , the true solution to the schrdinger equation can only be reached using fci in the limit that the finite one - particle basis spans all of space which typically entails @xmath4 . since this limit",
    "can never be reached in practice , schemes must be devised to find the behaviour of expectation values to allow for extrapolation to this limit .",
    "the complete basis set correlation energy , the difference between the hf and fci energies in the limit of @xmath4 , is an important goal in _ ab initio _ electronic - structure theory . here",
    ", we will concentrate on the convergence of the correlation energy noting that the convergence of the hartree - fock energy and orbitals is generally well - understood and in the case of real systems can be obviated with pseudopotentials or carefully chosen atom centred basis sets@xcite .",
    "however , the convergence of the correlation energy in a plane wave basis set , which has substantial contributions from electron - electron cusps , has not been widely investigated .    in studies of molecular systems",
    ", the cbs correlation energy can be reasonably well approximated by extrapolation . in doing so , a certain functional form of the correlation energy is assumed , which can be rationalised by a partial wave analysis of the wavefunction around the electron - electron cusp .",
    "most wavefunction based calculations of atoms and molecules employ correlation consistent gaussian type orbital ( gto ) basis sets , first developed by dunning and coworkers , that show systematic behavior for many atoms and molecules@xcite , converging as @xmath5 where @xmath6 refers to the cardinal number of the basis set@xcite .",
    "since this cardinal number refers to a principal expansion , the number of orbitals ( @xmath1 ) increases as @xmath7 , and this convergence is equivalent to @xmath0 .",
    "the application of quantum chemical wavefunction - based methods to the solid state is a young and emerging field.@xcite even within this body of work , most of the approaches have relied on a basis set expansion in periodic gtos , where the wealth of knowledge on the convergence properties of these basis sets is well established from decades of studies in molecular calculations .",
    "far less work has been undertaken on the convergence of determinantal wavefunction expansions in a plane wave basis , despite presenting a number of advantages when working in the solid state . by specifying a single cutoff parameter ,",
    "an arbitrarily large set of linearly independent and intrinsically periodic basis functions can be produced , which require no optimisation , are free of basis - set superposition error and well describe the nature of delocalised electrons , which are particularly difficult for expansion in a more localised basis .",
    "since wavefunction - based theories will inevitably be much more computationally expensive , it is imperative to develop methods in which the convergence with respect to the one - electron basis is as rapid as possible .",
    "although complete basis set results using extrapolation procedures have been presented for systems in a plane wave basis@xcite , a systematic analysis and rigorous justification for these schemes is still lacking .",
    "furthermore , the question arises as to whether more efficient basis set truncations exist within the complete plane wave set , which allow for a more reliable extrapolation to the complete basis set limit .",
    "this paper aims at a rigorous investigation of different extrapolation methods for the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) , which is taken to be the archetypal solid state model system , in order to extend the practicality of correlated wavefunction expansions in plane waves .",
    "the limiting behaviour of basis set convergence is due to the inability of determintantal expansions to describe the features of the electron cusp and this is independent of the precise parameterisation of the wavefunction arising from the underlying method .",
    "this allows scaling relationships to hold across the whole hierarchy of standard models . as such",
    ", this paper examines the behaviour of basis set incompleteness error in plane waves on the correlation energy of a finite @xmath2-electron gas by use of second - order mller - plesset theory ( mp2 ) , where analysis can be directly performed and numerically verified to gain a preliminary understanding of this error .",
    "this is possible due to the mp2 correlation energy of a finite electron gas being well - defined in spite of the divergent behaviour of this energy at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we show that a more natural interpretation of basis sets in momentum space can be found that relates to the momentum transfer vector .",
    "this discussion gives rise to a new type of basis set truncation that we can use to better eliminate basis set incompleteness error in mp2 and other theories .",
    "we then move away from the electron gas as a model system to show how these findings can be transferred back to real , solid - state systems .",
    "we hope that this provides the first thorough analysis of basis set incompleteness in calculations where a plane wave basis set is used and will allow for extrapolations to the cbs limit to be found , both more reliably and more efficiently .",
    "we note that extrapolation is not the only method by which basis set incompleteness error can be removed .",
    "it is now increasingly common practice in molecular quantum chemistry to use corrections based on including explicit functions of the inter - electronic distance into the wavefunction@xcite .",
    "furthermore , there have been significant advances in applying transcorrelated methods directly to the homogeneous electron gas@xcite .",
    "diffusion monte carlo , which is in general not particularly sensitive to basis set , has also been incredibly successful in describing ground - state energies and properties for the heg@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that simple complete basis set extrapolation techniques would enable reliable benchmarks to be obtained for the future development of wavefunction techniques in periodic systems .",
    "in this section we will use the archetypal model solid state system , the homogeneous electron gas , to better - understand basis set incompleteness in plane waves .",
    "we will introduce the heg hamiltonian and show how mp2 theory can be applied to produce an analytic expression for the correlation energy approaching the complete basis set limit , which we verify numerically .",
    "although it is well - known that the correlation energy arising from mp2 theory diverges in the thermodynamic limit due to long - wavelength excitations as the band gap closes@xcite , the qualitative cusp behaviour as inter - electronic distance goes to zero is inherently captured by short - wavelength excitations@xcite . as such , using mp2 as a model theory for correlation provides a good starting - point for our discussion of basis set incompleteness error .",

    "this can be solved directly for the non - interacting reference in the limit of both an infinite number of electrons and an infinite virtual k - space@xcite .",
    "however , the limit of a finite number of electrons is dependent on the form of potential @xmath44 and the shape of the real space unit cell .",
