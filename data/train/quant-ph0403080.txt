    "the phenomenon of avoided level crossing ( landau - zener effect ) is studied theoretically as well as experimentally for many years .",
    "it is a general property of the discrete states of a quantum system the energies of which will never cross when the interaction between them is nonvanishing .",
    "their wave functions are exchanged at the critical value of a certain tuning parameter where the avoided crossing takes place .",
    "the reason for the avoided crossing of two discrete levels follows from the expression for the two eigenvalues @xmath1 of the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the energies of the non - interacting states and @xmath5 is their interaction .",
    "since the square root contains only positive values , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are always different from one another with the only exception of vanishing interaction @xmath5 .    a crossing point of the two eigenvalues @xmath1 can be found by continuing into the complex plane , i.e. by adding a negative term into the square root .",
    "the mathematical properties of such a crossing point in the complex plane are discussed in many papers . according to kato @xcite",
    ", they are called exceptional points , since the spectrum is supposed to be incomplete at these points .",
    "the exceptional points are branch points in the complex plane @xcite . although the number of these points in the complex plane is of measure zero , their meaning for physical processes is large .",
    "they are related to the phenomenon of avoided crossing of discrete states as shown already in @xcite .    in recent studies , it turned out that not only discrete states avoid crossing , but also resonance states do not cross , as a rule @xcite . an avoided level crossing in the complex plane is accompanied by a redistribution of the spectroscopic properties of the resonance states .",
    "most interesting is the bifuraction of decay widths related to the avoided crossing of levels in the complex plane since it causes different time scales in the system .",
    "the long - lived ( trapped ) resonance states cause narrow resonances in the cross section on a weakly energy dependent background induced by the short - lived resonance states .",
    "a similar situation is discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "the resonance trapping phenomenon discussed in @xcite is a collective coherent resonance phenomenon as stated also in @xcite .",
    "the avoided level crossings may form a branch cut @xcite .",
    "this cut can be traced up to the avoided crossing of discrete states @xcite .",
    "often , the branch points in the complex plane are identified with double poles of the @xmath0 matrix @xcite when related to physical processes .",
    "it became possible directly to study the spectra of atoms in the very neighborhood of double poles of the @xmath0 matrix by means of laser fields @xcite .",
    "the results show a smooth behavior of the observables when crossing the double pole by tuning the parameters of the laser field .",
    "moreover , recent studies in the framework of schematical models have shown that the branch points in the complex plane separate the scenario with avoided level crossing from that without any crossing @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the double poles of the @xmath0 matrix are identified with points at which the eigenvalues of two states of the effective hamiltonian coalesce . in @xcite , the line shape of resonances in the very neighborhood of double poles of the @xmath0 matrix",
    "is studied .    in @xcite the @xmath0 matrix theory",
    "is applied to the transmission through double quantum dots ( qds ) consisting of two single qds and a wire connecting them .",
    "the study of these artificial molecules is of great interest since they display the simplest structures of quantum - computing devices that can be controlled by external parameters , e.g. @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting results obtained for a double qd system , is the appearance of transmission zeros of different order at energies that are related to the eigenvalues of the hamiltonians of the single qds @xcite .",
    "they appear even in cases when the transmission is large in this energy region .",
    "in such a case , they can be seen as narrow dips in the transmission probability .",
    "double dot systems provide a very powerful tool for studying the properties of branch points in the complex plane and their physical meaning .",
    "when leads are attached to them , the double dot systems allow further to study the relation of the branch points in the complex plane to both the double poles of the @xmath0 matrix and the points where two eigenvalues of the hamiltonian of the open quantum system coalesce .",
    "this is , above all , due to the symmetries involved in the system in a natural manner .",
    "moreover , the properties of a double dot system can be controlled by external parameters in a very clear manner .",
    "the double qd itself is characterized by the coupling strengths @xmath8 between the wire and the single qds , the spectral properties of the two single qds , as well as by the length and the width of the wire .",
    "the coupling of the double dot system to the environment is given by the coupling strength @xmath9 to the leads attached to it .",
    "all these parameters are well defined and can be controlled .",
    "one may call @xmath9 the external coupling of the double qd system ( via the leads ) and @xmath8 the internal coupling ( via the wire ) that is characteristic of the double dot system as a whole .    in the present paper , we will study a simple model for a double qd system with the aim to receive information on the branch points in the complex plane and their relation to physical processes such as transmission .",
    "we use @xmath0 matrix theory combined with the method of the effective hamiltonian which consists of two parts .",
    "the first part is the ( hermitian ) hamiltonian of the closed system and the second part is an additional ( non - hermitian ) term that takes into account the coupling of the states of the system via the continuum .",
    "the continuum is given by the modes propagating in the two half - infinite 1d - leads when attached to the system .",
    "the interplay between these two parts of the effective hamiltonian characterizes the different physical situations .    in sect .",
    "ii , we give the @xmath0 matrix for the transmission through a model double qd system by using the effective hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the double qd consists of two single qds with one state in each , a wire with a single eigenenergy that depends on the length of the wire , and with one channel for the propagation of the mode in the attached leads .",
    "we define the spectroscopic values @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the resonance states @xmath12 . in section iii",
    ", we study analytically the features of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors at the branch point in the complex plane . here , at a certain energy @xmath13 , two eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian coalesce . we show numerical examples obtained for branch points in the complex plane as well as for the transmission through the double dot system .",
    "the branch points can be seen by varying different parameters .",
    "the transmission scenario at small @xmath14 is characterized by transmission peaks which are spread over a certain energy region that is the larger the larger the internal interaction @xmath8 is .",
    "in contrast to this picture , the transmission peaks are no longer spread in energy when @xmath14 is large . here ,",
    "level attraction and width bifuraction take place with the consequence that one narrow resonance appears on a smooth background created by the two broad resonance states .",
    "the separation between the two different scenarios is provided by the branch point in the complex plane .",
    "this separation is independently of whether the eigenstates cross or avoid crossing in the complex plane at the energy @xmath15 .    in sect .",
    "iv , we consider the effective hamiltonian as well as the transmission through the double dot system when it is coupled with different strength to the two leads . in the following section v , we show numerical examples for transmission and eigenvalue trajectories of a double dot system with altogether five and eleven , respectively , states as a function of both , the length of the wire and the ( external ) coupling strength @xmath9 . the main features of the eigenvalue trajectories as well as of the transmission are the same as those discussed in sect .",
    "moreover , we draw some conclusions on the different bonds of the two single qds in the artificial molecule . the appearance of different bond types is also related to the positions of the branch points in the complex plane . in the last section ,",
    "we summarize the results obtained .",
    "in our study , we follow the paper @xcite where the @xmath0 matrix theory for transmission through qds in the tight - binding approach is formulated , and the paper @xcite where the @xmath0 matrix theory is applied to a double qd system consisting of two single qds coupled to each other by a wire . as in @xcite , we consider a simple model with a small number of states in each single qd and one mode propagating through the wire .",
    "this simple model is able to explain the characteristic features of the transmission through realistic double dot systems of the same structure , as shown in @xcite .",
    "first we will consider the simplest case with only one state @xmath16 in each single dot and one mode @xmath17 propagating in the wire of length @xmath18 .",
    "the wire and the single qds are coupled by @xmath8 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of such a system is @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hamiltonian of the closed double dot system , @xmath21 is the hamiltonian of the left ( @xmath22 ) and right ( @xmath23 ) reservoir and @xmath24 .",
    "the second term of @xmath25 takes into account the coupling of the eigenstates of @xmath26 via the reservoirs when the system is opened .",
    "it introduces correlations between the states of an open quantum system that appear additionally to those of the closed system @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 is non - hermitian",
    ".    the coupling matrix between the closed double dot system and the reservoirs can be found if both are specified .",
    "we take the reservoirs ( leads ) as semi infinite one - dimensional wires in tight- binding approach @xcite .",
    "the connection points of the coupling between the system and the reservoirs are at the edges of the one - dimensional leads . then the coupling matrix elements take the following form @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath12 is the wave vector related to the energy by @xmath28 ,  @xmath29 , are the eigenfunctions of ( [ hb3 ] ) , and @xmath9 is the hopping matrix element between the edge of the lead and the qd .",
    "the @xmath9 will be varied in our calculations .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ hb3 ] ) are real , @xmath30 and the eigenstates read @xmath31 as a result , we get the following expression for the effective hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath32 which is symmetric . its complex eigenvalues @xmath33 and eigenvectors @xmath34 are @xcite @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37    f & = & \\frac{v^2ue^{ik}}{\\sqrt{2}\\eta}\\ , , \\quad    \\omega=-\\eta+\\frac{\\delta\\varepsilon v^2e^{ik}}{2\\eta}\\ , , \\quad    \\xi^2=\\omega^2+f^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenfunctions are biorthogonal , @xmath38 with @xcite @xmath39 using the eigenvalues ( [ poles3 ] ) and eigenfunctions ( [ psiheff3 ] ) of the effective hamiltonian , the amplitude for the transmission through the double qd takes the simple form @xcite @xmath40 substituting ( [ vm ] ) , ( [ psib3 ] ) and ( [ psiheff3 ] ) into the matrix elements @xmath41 and @xmath42 we obtain @xmath43 the transmission probability is @xmath44 .",
    "the spectroscopic values such as the positions in energy of states are originally defined for the discrete eigenstates of hermitian hamilton operators that describe closed quantum systems .",
    "the decay widths do not appear explicitely in this formalism since the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian are real .",
    "they are calculated from the tunneling matrix elements by means of the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding values for resonance states are energy dependent functions since the eigenvalues as well as the eigenfunctions of the non - hermitian effective hamilton operator ( [ heffgen ] ) depend on energy .",
    "nevertheless , spectroscopic values for resonance states can be defined , and that by solving the fixed - point equations @xcite @xmath45 and defining @xmath46 the values @xmath10 and @xmath11 characterize a resonance state whose position in energy is @xmath10 and whose decay width is @xmath11 .",
    "this resonance state causes a resonance of breit - wigner type in the cross section when it is well separated from other resonance states . in the regime of overlapping resonances , the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 on the one hand , and the resonances seen in the cross section on the other hand , is less well defined .    in the denominator of the @xmath0 matrix ,",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath33 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 appear in their full energy dependence .",
    "that means that at every energy @xmath47 of the system , the contribution of every resonance state @xmath12 is taken into account in correspondence to the value @xmath48 .",
    "this fact becomes important when @xmath49 and the contribution of the resonance state @xmath12 can not be neglected at the energy @xmath50 , i.e. when the resonance states overlap .",
    "another definition of the spectroscopic values of a resonance state is by means of the poles of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "this ( standard ) definition of the spectroscopic values in the framework of the @xmath0 matrix theory is not a direct one since the poles of the @xmath0 matrix give information on the resonances , but not on the spectroscopic properties of the resonance states .",
    "the @xmath0 matrix has a pole only when the energy is continued into the complex plane .",
    "we remind however that the @xmath0 matrix describing physical processes is defined for real energies @xmath47 , and @xmath51 . it is not surprisingly therefore that the two definitions do not coincide completely . in the following",
    ", we will characterize the resonance states by the energy dependent eigenvalues @xmath33 and eigenfunctions @xmath34 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 as well as by the values @xmath10 and @xmath11 , but not by the poles of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "the reason for doing this , is the clear definition of the spectroscopic values @xmath10 and @xmath11 also in the regime of overlapping resonances @xcite , by means of the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 that describes the open quantum system .",
    "it may happen that , at a certain point , @xmath52 for two different states @xmath12 and @xmath53 .",
    "such a point might be considered as the analogue of a double pole of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "however , the coalescence of two eigenvalues @xmath54 at a certain energy @xmath15 does not mean that also the poles exactly coincide .",
    "therefore , we will not consider double poles of the @xmath0 matrix in the following , but will look at the points and their energies @xmath15 where the two eigenvalues @xmath55 coalesce .",
    "in such a case , the transmission is determined mainly by interferences between the two resonance states @xmath12 and @xmath53 .",
    "these interferences influence strongly the line shape of resonances @xcite .",
    "generally , two resonance states @xmath12 and @xmath53 avoid crossing in the complex plane , i.e. the eigenvalues @xmath33 and @xmath56 coalesce at an energy @xmath57 that is different from the energies @xmath58 .",
    "the phenomenon of avoided crossing of resonance states in the complex plane is in complete analogy to the well - known phenomenon of avoided crossing of discrete states . in the latter case ,",
    "the crossing point can be found by opening the system and varying the coupling strength of the discrete states to the continuum , i.e. by continuing into the complex plane . in both cases ,",
    "the crossing point influences strongly the properties of the states although it is hidden @xcite .",
    "the formalism for the description of double qds with more complicated structure is given in @xcite .",
    "we will not repeat it here .",
    "we will however use it to obtain some numerical results for the transmission through double qds with a larger number of states .",
    "let us define the value @xmath59 by which the two eigenvalues @xmath60 differ according to ( [ poles3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath61 is real only when @xmath62 . when @xmath63 , eq .",

    "the components of the ( complex ) eigenvectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 become infinitely large , and @xmath71 also the normalization condition ( [ biorth ] ) is fulfilled when @xmath67 due to the biorthogonality of the eigenfunctions , since the difference between two infinitely large numbers may be 0 or 1 .",
    "these relations between the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath25 that follow from the condition @xmath67 , hold not only for the special case considered here .",

    "this holds true also for the transmission zeros the positions of which are determined by the energies of the eigenstates of the two single qds .",

    ", the two outermost states do not approach each other completely .",
    "the lower state approaches one of the states out of the middle , and the upper state becomes trapped by these two states .",
    "as a consequence , the region with maximum transmission does not occur in the middle of the spectrum but at a somewhat lower energy .",
    "the reason for this asymmetry is the following : the functions @xmath231 of ten states are raising with energy while all the @xmath232 are vanishing at the two limits @xmath233 of the energy window ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the widths of the states at lower energy are larger than those of the states at higher energy so that they trap the higher - lying states . for details of the resonance trapping phenomenon see @xcite .     of the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 as a function of @xmath9 at @xmath129 .",

    "common to all the pictures shown in this section is that the single - channel transmission through a double qd is of resonant character although its structure depends strongly on the strength @xmath9 by which the dot is coupled to the attached leads .",
    "the point is that the evolution of the eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 as a function of external parameters changes fundamentally at branch points in the complex plane .",
    "the transmission through the double qd shows a correspondingly sensitive dependence on the external parameters .",
    "qualitative changes in the transmission picture are caused by branch points in the complex plane which separate the scenario with avoided level crossing from that without any crossing in the complex plane .",
    "while transmission occurs in the whole energy region with several peaks in the case with avoided level crossings , there is a smaller number of peaks of mostly different height in the case without any level crossings in the complex plane .",
    "the position of these peaks changes as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "common to both scenarios are only the @xmath18 independent transmission zeros ( for a detailled discussion of the transmission zeros see @xcite ) .",
    "the two coupling strengths @xmath9 and @xmath8 stand , respectively , for the coupling of the double qd as a whole to the leads ( environment ) and the coupling of the two single qds to the wire ( inside the double qd system ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 characterizes therefore the ratio between external and internal interaction of the states of an open quantum system .",
    "when the external coupling is much larger than the internal coupling , the external coupling of the levels via the modes propagating in the two leads , prevents the formation of a uniform qd . in the opposite case of large internal coupling , the relatively weak external coupling is unable to break the uniform qd .",
    "most interesting is , of course , the transition region between the two different types of bonds in double qds .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice the following .",
    "the two levels that are the outermost ones of the spectrum , cross or avoid crossing in the complex plane at @xmath129 .",
    "the distance in energy to the crossing or avoided crossing , that occurs between two other levels , is smaller than their decay widths .",
    "that means , effectively all states are involved in the scenario of avoided level crossing in the complex plane .",
    "additionally , we mention that the dependence of the transmission on the length @xmath18 of the wire is determined by the manner the wave propagates inside the wire .",
    "it can be replaced by another relation between @xmath237 and @xmath18 than that used in our calculations or by the analogue relation between @xmath237 and the width @xmath238 of the wire . in the last case ,",
    "@xmath18 can be kept constant in studying the dependence of the transmission from @xmath238 , see the discussion at the end of ref .",
    "the results considered in the present paper are obtained in the formalism worked out in @xcite for the description of a double qd system .",
    "the formalism is based on the @xmath0 matrix theory with use of the effective hamiltonian that describes the spectroscopic properties of the open quantum system .",
    "the formalism is applied in @xcite to the description of transmission zeros in the conductance through double qds .",
    "these zeros are determined by the spectroscopic properties of the constituents of the double dot system and by the manner the single qds are coupled .",
    "they appear at all ratios @xmath14 of the coupling strengths .",
    "our present study is devoted , above all , to the transmission peaks .",
    "their positions and widths depend on the ratio @xmath14 and are influenced by branch points in the complex plane . at these points ,",
    "the transition between the two scenarios with avoided level crossing and no crossing in the complex plane takes place . in any case , the transmission is resonant .",
    "as long as @xmath14 is small , the levels repel in energy ( as the discrete eigenstates of @xmath26 ) and the decay widths of the different states are of comparable value .",
    "this causes some spreading of the transmission probability over a relatively large energy region . at large @xmath14 , however , the levels attract in energy and the decay widths bifurcate .",
    "this causes transmission peaks at the positions of the narrow states that appear on the smooth background created by the broad states .",
    "the positions of the transmission peaks depend , in this case , strongly on the length of the wire or on another parameter that controls the propagation of the mode inside the wire .",
    "the two different scenarios are separated by a branch point in the complex plane . at such a point ,",
    "two eigenvalues ( @xmath33 and @xmath56 ) of the effective hamiltonian coalesce at the energy @xmath13 . sometimes , @xmath239 . mostly however @xmath240 and @xmath241 , and the branch point in the complex plane is not a double pole of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "we underline that the resonance phenomena appearing in the transmission through double qds are the same as those observed in , e.g. , the scattering on nuclei or atoms @xcite .",
    "the role of the branch points in the complex plane for the transmission through a double dot system agrees with that discussed in a schematical study @xcite and for a double - well system @xcite . in our model double qd",
    ", however , the energy dependence of the eigenvalues @xmath33 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath25 is relatively strong .",
    "especially @xmath88 shows a strong energy dependence due to the energy window with thresholds at a lower and an upper finite energy .",
    "the spectrum is therefore bounded from below and from above , and the eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian can not satisfyingly be approximated by the poles of the @xmath0 matrix .",
    "the results discussed here are true for single - channel transmission through a double qd system that consists of two single qds with similar energy spectra and a narrow wire that couples the two single qds and allows the propagation of only one mode .",
    "when the energy spectra of the two single qds are very different from one another and the coupling strength @xmath8 to the wire is small , the transmission picture at large @xmath9 differs from that discussed above .",
    "in such a case , the transmission is hindered at large @xmath9 , above all due to the energy gap between the levels of the two single qds through which the transmission takes place .    in the present paper , the behavior of a simple model",
    "is considered that reflects many characteristic features of realistic double qds with more complicated structure , see @xcite .",
    "the results obtained may guide the construction of double qds .",
    "the position of transmission zeros and transmission peaks can be controlled by varying the coupling strengths @xmath9 and @xmath8 as well as the propagation of the mode inside the wire .",
