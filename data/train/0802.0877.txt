    "the quantitative study of intrinsic galaxy shapes started with hubble ( 1930 ) , who measured the projected axial ratios of elliptical galaxies when classifying them into what would later become the hubble sequence . using the projected axial ratios measured from photographic plates of 254 spiral galaxies from the reference catalogue of bright galaxies (",
    "de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs 1964 ) , sandage , freeman & stokes ( 1970 ) concluded that the disks of spiral galaxies were circular , with a disk thickness ( defined as the ratio of disk height to diameter ) of @xmath15 . later estimates from photographic plate surveys",
    "were performed by binggeli ( 1980 ) , benacchio & galletta ( 1980 ) , and binney & de vaucouleurs ( 1981 ) , who concluded that galactic disks were consistent with almost circular ellipses , with a mean ellipticity of @xmath16 .",
    "these results , based on small samples of galaxies , have been superseded in recent years by much larger studies from ccd imaging and scans of wide - field photographic surveys ( fasano & vio 1991 ) .",
    "lambas , maddox & loveday ( 1992 ) analyzed a sample of @xmath17 apm galaxies , and found that the distribution of ellipticities was well fitted by a one - sided gaussian distribution centred on @xmath18 with a dispersion of @xmath19 and a mean of @xmath20 .",
    "rix & zaritsky ( 1995 ) studied a sample of kinematically selected face - on spiral galaxies in more detail , finding a typical ellipticity of @xmath21 in the galactic disk potential .",
    "spatially resolved observations of internal kinematics can sort out the three - dimensional shape of a galaxy ( binney 1985 ; franx  1991 ; statler 1994ab , statler & fry 1994 ; bak & statler 2000 ; statler , lambright , & bak 2001 ) .",
    "andersen ( 2001 ) and andersen & bershady ( 2003 ) applied this method to 24 largely face - on spirals and found a mean ellipticity of @xmath22 , similar to that of rix & zaritsky .",
    "however , in both cases the selection of face - on objects may have introduced systematic biases in the sample .",
    "future work with the sauron spectrograph ( bacon  2001 ; de zeeuw  2002 ) will allow detailed three - dimensional models to be created for a much larger number of galaxies .",
    "taking advantage of the large number of galaxies with high - quality photometry and shape measurements in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york  2000 ) , ryden ( 2004 ) selected a sample of spiral galaxies from the sdss data release 1 ( dr1 , abazajian  2003 ) , chosen to minimise systematics due to seeing .",
    "she found that the distribution of galactic disk ellipticities can be well fit by a gaussian distribution in @xmath23 with a mean of @xmath24 and a standard deviation of 0.89 .",
    "vincent & ryden ( 2005 ) extended this work using the sdss data release 3 ( abazajian  2005 ) , and fit the distribution of axis ratios of both ellipticals and spirals to triaxial models . assuming a uniform triaxiality ( i.e. all galaxies are either prolate , triaxial or oblate )",
    ", they found that both spiral and elliptical distributions are consistent with oblate spheroids .",
    "moreover , high luminosity elliptical galaxies show rounder shapes than do lower - luminosity ellipticals .",
    "elliptical galaxies were once believed to be axisymmetric oblate spheroids , until it was discovered that their rotation velocities were insufficient to support such a geometry ( bertola & capaccioli 1975 ) .",
    "binney ( 1976 ) suggested that ellipticals could be well described by a triaxial ellipsoid but davies  ( 1983 ) found that small ellipticals are better fit by oblate spheroids .",
    "this variety of intrinsic shapes for elliptical galaxies makes it difficult to obtain their intrinsic shapes using only their apparent images ; when this approach is used on large numbers of elliptical galaxies , it is often necessary to assume a triaxiality as in vincent & ryden ( 2005 ) , or to use the misalignment between the internal isophotes of individual elliptical galaxies as suggested by binney & merrifield ( 1987 ) .",
    "the study of intrinsic shapes of spheroids has been recently extended to bulges in spiral galaxies by mndez - abreu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; bulge shapes are found to be consistent with a mean axial ratio in the equatorial plane of @xmath25 .",
    "astronomers as early as holmberg ( 1958 ) realised that the shape distribution of spiral galaxies is affected by the presence of dust .",
    "optically thick dust obscuration aligned in the rotational plane of spirals will cause edge - on objects to appear systematically fainter , and thus they will be under - represented in magnitude - limited samples , biasing the estimates of intrinsic galaxy shapes .",
    "the dust extinction of galaxies is important for understanding the true luminosities of galaxies , the distribution of ism in galaxies , and the relationship between optical and infrared emission from galaxies ( for reviews , see davies & burstein 1995 and calzetti 2001 ) , and studies of the brightness of galaxies as a function of axial ratio should allow the effects of dust to be quantified .",
    "valentijn ( 1990 ) studied the shapes and surface brightnesses of @xmath26 galaxies from digitised photographic plates , and interpreted the data as indicating an optically thick component in disk galaxies , extending well beyond the apparent optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "burstein , haynes & faber ( 1991 ) and choloniewski ( 1991 ) however , showed that valentijn s results were due in part to selection effects , and found that the diameters of galaxies were independent of inclination ; see davies  ( 1993 ) and valentijn ( 1994 ) for further discussion of these issues .",
    "peletier & willmer ( 1992 ) expanded on the effects of selection biases with inclination , and emphasised that that the dust opacity may depend on galaxy luminosity .",
    "tully  ( 1998 ) , for example , found a 1.3 mag difference in the r band between face - on and edge - on luminous galaxies , but found a negligible effect for intrinsically faint galaxies .",
    "holwerda  ( 2005a , 2005b ) used a more direct method for obtaining the opacities of spiral disks , consisting of measuring the number of field galaxies seen through galactic disks using images from the hubble space telescope wfpc2 archival data .",
    "this method had previously been applied to ground - based data by many other authors , including zaritsky ( 1994 ) , nelson zaritsky & cutri ( 1998 ) , and keel & white ( 2001 ) .",
    "valotto & giovanelli ( 2005 ) followed a different approach to derive the dust extinction in galaxies , using the inner part of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "more recently , a number of groups have studied the variation of galaxy properties with the inclination angle with respect to the line - of - sight , or more directly with projected galaxy shapes , to draw conclusions regarding dust extinction in spiral galaxies .",
    "shao  ( 2007 ) measured dust extinction in spiral sdss - dr2 ( abazajian  2004 ) galaxies by studying the luminosity function of galaxies with different inclination angles , and using the intrinsic galaxy shapes as inferred from the distribution of projected axis ratios .",
    "they interpret the decrease in characteristic lf luminosity ( @xmath27 ) with increasing inclination as an effect of dust extinction , where the disk optical depth is roughly proportional to the cosine of the inclination angle .",
    "however , they did not take into account the influence of dust on the projected shapes of galaxies .",
    "unterborn & ryden ( 2008 ) also study the variation of the luminosity function with inclination using a subsample of @xmath28 galaxies from the sdss data release 6 ( dr6 , adelman - mccarthy  2008 ) , finding similar results for the dependence of extinction on projected shape .",
    "they use this to define an extinction - unbiased sample of spiral galaxies for which they estimate intrinsic shapes .",
    "even though their results indicate that these galaxies are consistent with flattened disks as was found by previous authors ( e.g. ryden 2004 ) , the definition of the sample makes it difficult to compare their results with previous estimates .",
    "maller  ( 2008 ) study the variations of galaxy properties with inclination and derive extinction corrections using the nyu - vagc ( blanton  2005 ) , which combines data from sdss and the two - micron all sky survey ( skrutskie  2006 ) .",
    "the median extinction over their whole sample ( all morphological types ) is @xmath29 magnitudes in the @xmath30-band .",
    "finally , driver et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also study the dependence of the luminosity function with inclination , by decoposing their sample of galaxies in the millenium galaxy catalogue ( liske et al . , 2003 , driver et al",
    ". , 2005 ) into bulge and disk components , and are able to deduce the residual face - on attenuation .",
    "dust has also been found in elliptical galaxies .",
    "ebneter , davis & djorgovski ( 1988 ) used colour maps to find evidence of dust in more than @xmath31 of their sample of elliptical galaxies ; @xmath32 of the galaxies showed evidence for a dusty disk .",
    "however , the amount of dust in ellipticals is rather smaller than in spirals .",
    "for instance , knapp  ( 1989 ) found that an elliptical galaxy contains between @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the dust content present in a spiral galaxy of similar luminosity ( see also leeuw 2004 , krause  2003 , goudfrooij 2000 ) .",
    "far - infrared observations of elliptical galaxies by temi  ( 2004 ) also place constraints on the mass of dust in ellipticals in the range @xmath35m@xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath38 .",
    "this mass is @xmath39 of the stellar mass , a much smaller fraction than seen in spiral galaxies , where the fraction is of order @xmath40 ( see for instance stevens , amure & gear , 2005 ) .",
    "this paper will use the sdss dr6 to derive the intrinsic three - dimensional shapes of spiral and elliptical galaxies using the apparent photometric shapes of galaxies .",
    "we will include an in - depth analysis of the effects of dust on the distribution of apparent shapes of spiral galaxies , which will explain most of the trend seen in the distribution of spiral shapes with luminosity and colour .",
    "our analysis weights galaxies by the inverse of the volume out to which they can be seen , thus simulating a volume - limited catalogue , and allowing us to use the full sample of galaxies available in the sdss dr6 .",
    "furthermore , the large number of galaxies present in this sample allows us to study the dependence of the intrinsic shapes of galaxies with luminosity , colour and physical size . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a standard @xmath41cdm cosmology , with matter density parameter @xmath42 and a cosmological constant corresponding to @xmath43 .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : gx ] we will briefly describe the sdss dr6 galaxies , and the parameters we consider when measuring the distribution of shapes . section [ sec : shapes ] explains our methodology , including our model for the effects of dust on the observed distribution of axis ratios .",
    "section [ sec : results ] shows our results , and section [ sec : discussion ] summarises the main conclusions drawn from this work .",
    "we select the @xmath44 galaxies from the @xmath45 magnitude - limited main spectroscopic galaxy sample of the sdss ( strauss  2002 ) from the sdss dr6 ( adelman - mccarthy  2008 ) .",
    "the sdss imaging data consist of ccd imaging data in five photometric bands ( @xmath46 , fukugita  1996 ) , taken with a drift - scan camera ( gunn 1998 ) on a dedicated wide - field 2.5 m telescope ( gunn  2006 ) .",
    "the properties of all detected objects in the images are measured ( lupton  1999 ; stoughton  2002 ) , and are calibrated astrometrically ( pier  2003 ) and photometrically ( smith 2002 ; ivezi  2004 ; tucker  2006 ) .",
    "we k - correct the galaxy magnitudes using v3.2 of the code described in blanton & roweis ( 2006 ) .",
    "the image of each galaxy in the sdss sample is fit to two - dimensional models of a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) surface profile and an exponential profile , each convolved with the psf of the image .",
    "this fitting procedure provides a measurement of the model axial ratios ( @xmath47 ) of each galaxy image in a way robust to seeing , as well as the effective radius and position angle of the galaxy .",
    "the sdss image pipeline also fits an ellipse to the 25 mag / arcsec@xmath48 isophote of each galaxy , and determines the so - called adaptive moments ( bernstein & jarvis 2002 ) ; while the axis ratios via these statistics are generally in good agreement with those from the model fits , they are affected by seeing , and thus tend to yield systematically rounder shapes than do the model fits .",
    "( 430,340 ) ( 0,-35 )    ( 430,370 ) ( 0,-20 )    we will infer the three - dimensional shapes of spiral and elliptical galaxies separately .",
    "park & choi ( 2005 ) presented a very accurate way to determine sdss galaxy morphologies using colour gradients that could be used to separate the dr6 catalogue into spiral and elliptical galaxies , but this would require analyzing the images of each individual galaxy separately .",
    "we use an alternative method : in fitting the exponential and de vaucouleurs models , the sdss imaging pipeline also asks for the best linear combination of these models ( abazajian  2004 ) , as quantified by the parameter @xmath49 .",
    "we use this parameter to distinguish spiral galaxies ( @xmath50 ) from ellipticals ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "it is not possible using these techniques to separate out lenticular or @xmath52 galaxies ; the definition of this morphological type is difficult using photometric data , out to the redshifts explored in this work .",
    "the axis ratios from the exponential and de vaucouleurs models are in excellent agreement , independent of the value of fracdev , with a scatter of about 0.05 around the identity line , but we adopt the axis ratios from the exponential fit when @xmath50 , and the de vaucouleurs parameters otherwise .",
    "all our analyses are carried out using model devaucouleurs or exponential @xmath8-band magnitudes and @xmath53 colours , depending on the galaxy type .",
    "in this section we will measure the distribution of projected axis ratios and present the model that will allow us to infer their intrinsic shapes .",
    "figure [ fig : badr3figs ] shows distributions of spiral galaxies on the left panels , and of elliptical galaxies on the right panels .",
    "the top panels show distributions of galaxy redshifts , and the middle and lower panels the distributions of projected axis ratios .",
    "in addition , the thick solid lines in the top and middle panels show the distributions of redshifts and projected axis ratios for the full sample of galaxies in the sdss - dr6 . in these panels ,",
    "the thin lines illustrate the variation of redshift and projected axis ratio distributions as the typical galaxy luminosity of the sample is increased .",
    "more luminous galaxies tend to show rounder apparent shapes ( axial ratios closer to unity ) , suggesting that the intrinsic shapes of galaxies are a function of luminosity .",
    "this is a flux - limited sample , and thus has a strong correlation between luminosity and redshift , as shown in the top panel . with this in mind",
    ", we simulate a volume - limited measurement of apparent shapes by simply weighting each galaxy by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the volume corresponding to the maximum distance out to which a galaxy of a given apparent magnitude enters the flux - limited catalogue , taking into account k - corrections weight is the larger sample size and the increased range of luminosities that can be explored ; using a true volume - limited sample would restrict our analysis to a sample almost @xmath56 times smaller composed only by intrinsically bright galaxies . ] . as a result of these procedures ,",
    "our final samples of spirals and ellipticals contain a total of @xmath57 and @xmath58 galaxies , respectively .",
    "there is an additional effect for spiral galaxies , whereby the internal extinction will cause edge - on objects to appear fainter than equally luminous face - on objects . we thus first volume - limited ignoring this effect , determined the inclination dependence of the extinction as described in ",
    "[ ssec : dust ] below , and then redefined our volume - limited sample taking this extinction into account and repeated our analysis .",
    "we found that the inferred extinction differed by only 0.1 mag between the two analyses , so we did not iterate further .",
    "the solid lines in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : badr3figs ] show the resulting distributions of axial ratios for spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "not surprisingly , the spiral galaxy distribution is skewed toward lower axial ratios ( @xmath47 values ) than are the ellipticals , which are rounder with @xmath47 closer to @xmath33 .",
    "( 230,250 ) ( 0,-20 )    ( 230,240 ) ( 0,0 )    the distribution becomes flatter when using the @xmath54 weighting .",
    "in particular , the weighted distribution of @xmath47 values for spiral galaxies is qualitatively similar to that of ryden ( 2004 ) , who found a flat distribution over a wide range of @xmath47 values from @xmath59 to @xmath60 for a volume limited sample of sdss - dr2 spiral galaxies .",
    "we use @xmath54 weighting in all the analyses that follow .",
    "galaxies fainter than @xmath61 have very small values of @xmath55 , and thus tend to dominate the noise of the estimate of the distribution function ; we therefore drop such low - luminosity objects in what follows . throughout this paper , error - bars",
    "were calculated using the jack - knife method .",
    "we model galaxies as triaxial ellipsoids of major axis @xmath62 , middle axis @xmath63 , and minor axis @xmath64 , parameterised by two axis ratios , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and we will determine the distribution of axis ratios of the spiral and elliptical populations separately . following ryden ( 2004 ) , we assume that the distribution of @xmath67 of the three - dimensional structure can be approximated by a gaussian with mean @xmath68 ( this parameter is related to @xmath69 in ryden 2004 , via @xmath70 ) and standard deviation @xmath71 .",
    "we also assume that there is a log - normal distribution in the quantity @xmath72 , with mean @xmath73 and dispersion @xmath74 .",
    "larger values of @xmath68 and @xmath73 correspond to more elliptical objects in the @xmath75 and @xmath76 planes , respectively . given values of axis ratios drawn from these distributions , and a random viewing angle @xmath77 , we compute the resulting apparent axis ratio , @xmath47 ( binney 1985 ) , using equations @xmath78 from ryden ( 2004 ) . repeating this multiple times",
    "gives a model distribution ( @xmath79 ) which can be compared directly to our measured volume - weighted distributions ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this model assumes that the dust extinction in galaxies is independent of the viewing angle . however , we can test for the effects of dust by exploring the dependence of the shape distribution on absolute magnitude and colour",
    ". the top - left panel of figure [ fig : absmdr3 ] shows the median @xmath47 of spiral and elliptical galaxies as a function of @xmath8-band absolute magnitude . both spiral and elliptical",
    "galaxies tend to be rounder at higher luminosities .",
    "spiral galaxies show a change of @xmath81 between absolute magnitude values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the variation in @xmath47 for ellipticals is smaller , @xmath84 .",
    "the top - right panel shows the median @xmath47 as a function of @xmath53 colour .",
    "red spiral galaxies show systematically larger axis ratios than do blue spirals .",
    "we interpret the colour and luminosity dependence of spirals as due to the reddening and dimming effects of dust , which becomes more prominent for edge - on systems .",
    "elliptical galaxies show only a mild variation in shape with absolute magnitude , and no significant effect in colour .",
    "thus , not unexpectedly , we see no evidence for a dust layer aligned with the principal plane of elliptical galaxies , and assume that the trend in the apparent shape of ellipticals with luminosity corresponds to a real variation of their intrinsic shapes .",
    "we study the dependence of projected and intrinsic properties of spiral and elliptical galaxies in more detail in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the middle panels of figure [ fig : absmdr3 ] show the luminosity and colour distribution functions ( left and right panels , respectively ) , both estimated using the @xmath54 estimator , for spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "the filled circles in the middle - left panel give the @xmath8-band luminosity function estimate from blanton  ( 2003a ) , with schechter parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; our results for the full sample ( black solid lines ) are in excellent agreement .",
    "as the effects of dust are more severe for edge - on objects , we also calculate the luminosity and colour functions for face - on objects ( @xmath87 ) only .",
    "these are shown as solid lines for the spiral galaxies in the bottom panels of this figure ; the dashed lines show the luminosity and colour functions for all the spiral galaxies for comparison .",
    "the break in the face - on luminosity function is shifted towards higher luminosities , as expected for the sample of galaxies least affected by dust .",
    "this measurement of the  unextincted \" luminosity function is in agreement with results from shao  ( 2007 ) , unterborn & ryden ( 2008 ) and , taking into account the range allowed by the analysis , with maller  ( 2008 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the colour function of spiral galaxies is shifted to the red due to the effects of dust .",
    "these estimates of unextincted luminosity and unreddened colour functions will be needed when we model the effects of dust , a subject to which we now turn .      in this section ,",
    "we develop a simple model for the impact of a planar distribution of dust on the distribution of apparent axis ratios of spiral galaxies .",
    "we assume no correlation between the dust column and the physical diameter of the galaxy , an assumption we will justify a posteriori . while unterborn & ryden ( 2008 ) use the inclination dependence of the luminosity function to define a sample of galaxies not affected by dust ( i.e. not biased towards face - on objects ) , our shape fitting solves for the dust effects self - consistently .    we follow the following steps to produce the predicted distribution of projected axis ratios , given our assumed distribution of axis ratios and our measured luminosity and colour distributions :    1 .",
    "we assume that the amount of extinction and reddening are roughly proportional to the path length of the light through the galaxy .",
    "therefore , we expect a minimum extinction when a galaxy is seen face - on , and an increasing extinction as the line - of - sight approaches the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "similarly , shao  ( 2007 ) , unterborn & ryden ( 2008 ) and maller  ( 2008 ) all find that the optical depth increases monotonically with inclination angle .",
    "the following parametrisation of the angle dependence of dust extinction is not intended as a physical model , but as a heuristic guess for the scaling . consider an oblate triaxial galaxy with axis ratios given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the total dust extinction as a function of inclination @xmath90 in our model is @xmath91 where @xmath9 is the edge - on extinction in magnitudes in a given band and @xmath92 is the galaxy height to diameter ratio extracted from a distribution of mean @xmath68 and width @xmath71 .",
    "the same can be assumed for the dust reddening , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the edge - on reddening in magnitudes . in the optically thin case",
    ", we can tie @xmath94 to the extinction via @xmath95 , as is appropriate for the @xmath8-band and @xmath53 colour .",
    "we find that our model results are not strongly dependent on this parameter and therefore can be applied to either the optically thin or thick case .",

    "similarly , we define @xmath100 as the ratio between the underlying and reddened distributions of galaxy colours .",
    "we calculate the ratio of the number of galaxies seen at inclination @xmath90 to the number expected without extinction , by multiplying the effects of reddening and extinction together , @xmath101 where @xmath102 , and the function @xmath103 contains the correlation between colour and @xmath104 .",
    "we assume that @xmath103 is gaussian with mean and dispersion extracted directly from the data ; this correlation is compatible with the results shown in figures @xmath105 and @xmath106 of blanton  ( 2003b ) .",
    "the sub - index @xmath107 indicates that the luminosity and colour functions correspond to a particular subsample of galaxies ; these subsamples are defined using sharp cuts in the allowed luminosity and colour ranges .",
    "this indicates that @xmath108 depends not only on the amount of extinction and reddening , but also on the range of luminosities and colours present in each subsample of galaxies .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ eq : psi ] ignores the presence of large - scale structure , which is justified given the large solid angle of the sdss sample .",
    "we then construct the model distribution of apparent axis ratios @xmath79 as described in section [ sec : shapes ] .",
    "rather than selecting the cosine of the viewing angle from a flat distribution , we select it from @xmath109 as given in equation  ( [ eq : psi ] ) . in the case where @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 .    in general , the effect of dust extinction and reddening is to decrease the number of galaxies seen edge - on relative to those that are face - on .",
    "this decrease depends strongly on the luminosity and colour functions , as well as on the selected range of luminosities and colours .",
    "the above process gives a prediction for the observed projected axis ratio distribution for a given set of triaxial galaxy parameter distribution functions and dust properties .",
    "note that for a given viewing angle , the model states that the dust affects the likelihood that a galaxy would enter the sample at that viewing angle , but does not affect the observed projected axis ratio .",
    "this is a good approximation as long as the dust is smoothly distributed within individual galaxies .    in the following section",

    "spirals and ellipticals have intrinsically different shapes , and we fit to the two separately . for spirals ,",
    "we also include the effects of dust via the extinction parameter @xmath9 which in turn defines the reddening @xmath94 .",

    "the grids include the full range of values suggested for these parameters in the literature .",
