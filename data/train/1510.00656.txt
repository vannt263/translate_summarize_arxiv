    "an assembly of hard squares in two dimensions presents a variety of potential spatial orders .",
    "hard particles form thermodynamic phases dictated solely by the entropy of their geometric packing ; temperature is irrelevant as the interaction potential has no finite energy scale .",
    "particles with asymmetric shapes have anisotropic constraints of self - avoidance and therefore pack in complex phases .",
    "squares are an obvious point of entry into this complexity because they can tile the plane without frustration .",
    "however , there has been relatively little investigation into the phases formed by this simple shape as a function of density , and still less of the dynamics within these phases .",
    "the phase diagram of isotropic hard disks  [ 13 ] offers a context for the ordering of asymmetric particles .",
    "a two - dimensional crystal of disks has correlations in particle positions with algebraic ( power - law ) decay . as density",
    "is decreased the crystal melts into the hexatic phase in which the orientation of `` bonds '' between neighboring particles has algebraic correlations , which finally melts into an isotropic liquid phase .",
    "anisotropic particles have both translational and rotational degrees of freedom , each of which may order independently or become coupled , providing the possibility of new classes of order .",
    "for example , particle ( or `` molecular '' ) orientations may order independently of their locations , giving rise to phases with global orientational order in the absence of translational order , e.g.  the nematic liquid crystal phase .",
    "these phases in two dimensions have been explored using various rigid shapes with a two - fold rotational symmetry , such as rectangles  [ 4,5 ] , ellipses  [ 6 ] , or rods  [ 79 ] .",
    "some of these two - fold symmetric particles yield phases with four - fold symmetry .",
    "this has also been demonstrated by density functional theories  [ 10,11 ] .",
    "minor differences in shape can have drastic effects on the phase diagram of such systems in two dimensions  [ 1214 ] , and three dimensions  [ 1517 ] .",
    "existing work on shapes with four - fold symmetry  such as squares  is limited , but raises interesting questions about the phase diagram .",
    "monte carlo simulations of an equilibrium hard - square system by wojciechowski and frenkel suggest a four - fold tetratic phase with longer - range orientational order than translational order  [ 18 ] .",
    "by contrast , in experiments on a colloidal suspension of square - shaped tiles osmotically constrained to a surface , zhao  _ et  al . _ found no evidence of an orientationally ordered state  [ 19 ] . at densities above that of the isotropic phase",
    ", they instead observed a `` hexagonal rotator '' phase where particles form a plastic crystal with hexagonal bond - orientational order but no molecular - orientational order . at higher densities ,",
    "the system enters a rhombic phase with a lattice angle that continuously approaches the 90 angle of a square crystal at full packing .",
    ".potential phases from combinations of translational , bond- , and molecular - orientational order . ``",
    " '' indicates short - range order with exponentially decaying spatial correlations ; `` x '' indicates quasi - long - range order with algebraic decay . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     bond - orientational order , determined by particle positions alone , increases in the same density range where molecular - orientational order sets in , though with smaller amplitude and shorter - ranged correlations .",
    "though these are distinct kinds of order in independent degrees of freedom , their coexistence is not surprising because position and orientation are not separable in the pair interaction  [ 23,24 ] .    to our knowledge , this is the first experimental study of the hard - square limit .",
    "this granular system displays a sequence of phases consistent with equilibrium monte carlo simulations reported in  [ 12 ] and  [ 18 ] . as in those studies ,",
    "the limited system size restricts structural analysis and smooths out transitions , making it difficult to pinpoint transition densities or study critical behaviour .",
    "however , measurements of the dynamics of the system  inaccessible by monte carlo  strengthen the evidence for the sequence of phases . in particular , the ratio of translational and rotational diffusion constants serves as a useful tool to show that orientational freezing precedes translational freezing ."
