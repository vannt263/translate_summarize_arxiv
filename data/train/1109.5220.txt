    "* corollary 2.4 ) : with certain mild hypotheses , there is at most one way to fill a torus boundary component of a 3manifold so that thurston norm decreases .",
    "lackenby @xcite , building on this work , proved a theorem relating dehn surgery properties of a knot to the intersection between the knot and essential surfaces in the 3manifold .",
    "lackenby used his results to study the effect of twisting the unknot along a knot having linking number zero with the unknot , and to study @xcite the uniqueness properties of dehn surgery on certain knots in certain 3-manifolds .",
    "lackenby @xcite and kalfagianni @xcite also used lackenby s theorem to study the unknotting properties of certain knots .    in this paper , we prove a version of lackenby s theorem for attaching a 2handle to a sutured 3manifold along a suture .",
    "like lackenby , we use scharlemann s combinatorial version of sutured manifold theory @xcite .",
    "although our method is inspired by the proofs of gabai s and lackenby s theorems , the proof is very different .    for the statement of the main result , let @xmath0 be a sutured manifold and let @xmath1 be a component of genus at least 2 .",

    "the main result of this paper is :    suppose that @xmath0 is taut and that the components of @xmath11 adjacent to @xmath5 are both thrice punctured spheres or are both once - punctured tori .",

    "the fourth conclusion is useful , since the inequality can be rearranged to be : @xmath29 thus , for example , if @xmath14 happens to be disjoint from @xmath30 , then twice the negative euler characteristic of the surface is an upper bound for the number of times the boundary of the surface intersects @xmath5 .",
    "the third conclusion of the theorem is of particular interest in that it is related to several well - known and very useful facts :    * if @xmath31 is an unknotting number one knot in @xmath32 and if @xmath20 is an arc in the knot complement defining a crossing change converting @xmath31 into the unknot then @xmath20 is isotopic into a minimal genus seifert surface for @xmath31 . *",

    "any minimal genus seifert surface can be used as the first surface in a taut sutured manifold hierarchy of the knot exterior , and so any minimal genus seifert surface can be thought of as part of a branched surface associated to a taut sutured manifold hierarchy of the knot exterior .",
    "since these facts have proven to be very useful , the third conclusion of the main theorem of this paper also has the potential to be useful and perhaps points to a connection between the various _ ad hoc _",

    "these three facts previously all had proofs which use sutured manifold theory , but the methods were different .",
    "the advantage of the new proofs is that they are all nearly identical .",
    "since some effort is required to rephrase the theorems in a way in which the main theorem of this paper can be usefully applied , we defer proofs for all but the last fact to @xcite ; the new proof of the last fact is given in this paper .",
    "indeed , we prove the following stronger theorem for tunnel number one knots and 2component links in any 3manifold admitting such a knot or link ( see section [ tunnels ] for the definitions ) :    suppose that @xmath33 is a knot or 2-component link in a closed , orientable 3-manifold @xmath7 such that @xmath33 has tunnel number one .",

    "an examination of the sutures @xmath51 shows that for all but at most one choice of @xmath5 , @xmath50 remains taut .",
    "one of the fundamental theorems of sutured manifold theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.9 ) ( see theorem [ thm : tautness up ] below ) implies that , except for the exceptional slope , @xmath44 and @xmath38 are taut .",
    "equivalently , we can begin with the dehn - filled @xmath20-taut sutured manifold @xmath52 where @xmath20 is the core of the surgery solid torus .",
    "the hierarchy for @xmath4 is then a @xmath20-taut sutured manifold hierarchy for @xmath52 where each decomposing surface is disjoint from @xmath20 .",
    "we conclude that for all but at most one choice of @xmath5 , the sutured manifold @xmath53 and the surface @xmath38 are not only @xmath20taut , but also @xmath54taut .",
    "there are two advantages to this viewpoint .",
    "one is that it is possible to see that if the hierarchy is taut then @xmath20 has infinite order in the fundamental group of @xmath55 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem a.6 ) .",

    ". some components of @xmath60 lie in @xmath62 . since @xmath16 is essential , @xmath63 is the union of discs with boundary on @xmath64 and annuli with at least one boundary component on @xmath64 .",
    "these boundary components must cross the sutures on @xmath64 . analyzing these intersections",
    "gives a lower bound on @xmath65 which is , therefore , a lower bound on @xmath66 .",
