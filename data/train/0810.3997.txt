    "recently the pax collaboration was formed @xcite with the aim to measure the proton transversity in the interaction of polarized antiprotons with protons at the future fair facility in darmstadt . in order to produce an intense beam of polarized antiprotons",
    ", the collaboration is going to use antiproton elastic scattering off a polarized hydrogen target ( @xmath8h ) in a storage ring @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is connected to the result of the filtex experiment @xcite , where a sizeable effect of polarization buildup was achieved in a storage ring by scattering of unpolarized protons off a polarized hydrogen atoms at low beam energies of 23 mev .    according to recent theoretical analyses @xcite the polarization effect observed in ref .",
    "@xcite has to be interpreted in such a way that solely the spin dependence of the hadronic ( proton - proton ) interaction provides the spin - filtering mechanism , i.e. is responsible for different rates of removal of protons from the ring for different initial polarization states . in other words @xcite , proton scattering on the polarized electrons of hydrogen atoms",
    "can not provide a sizeable effect of polarization buildup , as it was assumed before @xcite .",
    "indeed , the maximal scattering angle in this process , @xmath9 mrad , is less than the beam acceptance angle @xmath10 , which is defined so that for scattering at smaller angle @xmath11 the projectile remains in the beam . for this case , the beam - into - beam scattering kinematics of this process in a storage ring allows the proton polarization buildup only due to spin - flip transitions between the initial and final spin states of the beam proton @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since the coulomb interaction between the protons and electrons is spin - independent it can not provide spin - flip transitions and , consequently , does not contribute to the polarization buildup . the same argument ,",
    "obviously , is valid in case of antiproton scattering off a hydrogen target .",
    "therefore , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that only the hadronic interaction can be used to produce polarized antiprotons on the basis of the spin - filtering mechanism .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath12 case , the spin - dependent part of the @xmath13 interaction is poorly known experimentally at present .",
    "therefore , to investigate the polarization buildup mechanism in @xmath14h scattering a new experiment is planned at cern @xcite .",
    "the stored antiprotons will be scattered off a polarized @xmath8h target in that experiment @xcite and the polarization of the antiproton beam will be measured at intermediate energies .",
    "some theoretical estimations @xcite of the expected polarization effects were already performed employing a specific model of the @xmath15 interaction .    in this context , it is interesting and useful to explore other hadronic reactions as possible source for the antiproton polarization buildup too . therefore , in the present work we study polarization effects in antiproton - deuteron ( @xmath16 ) scattering for beam energies up to 300 mev .",
    "besides the issue of polarization buildup for antiprotons , @xmath17 scattering on a polarized deuteron , if it will be studied experimentally , can be also used as a test for our present knowledge of the @xmath18 and @xmath7 interactions .",
    "our investigation is based on the glauber - sitenko theory for @xmath0 scattering and it utilizes the @xmath5 interaction models developed by the jlich group @xcite as input for the elementary amplitudes . since there are data on ( unpolarized ) total and differential @xmath3 cross sections in the considered energy range we can examine the reliability of the glauber approach via a direct comparison of our results to experimental information .",
    "in addition we also present results for polarization effects for the @xmath19 system itself . with the @xmath19 potentials developed by the jlich group we have conceptually rather different models at our disposal than the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite and it will be instructive to see and compare the corresponding predictions . moreover , we consider here the @xmath7 as well as the @xmath18 case .",
    "let us mention here for completeness that very recently new qed calculations for polarization transfer in proton - electron ( and antiproton - positron ) elastic scattering were performed @xcite .",
    "these calculations predict very large polarization transfer from polarized electrons ( positrons ) to unpolarized protons ( antiprotons ) in elastic proton - electron ( antiproton - positron ) scattering at low beam energies , less than 20 kev @xcite . on this basis",
    "new sources for polarized antiprotons are under discussion @xcite . on the other hand , according to a calculation presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect of polarization buildup is negligible in this reaction , even at small relative velocites .",
    "a recent measurement performed at cosy @xcite intends to explore this method .",
    "finally , another method for buildup of polarized antiprotons at high energies , based on production of @xmath20 and its subsequentional decay @xmath21 , has been proposed in ref .",

    "( @xmath230 ) themselves are all roughly of comparable magnitude for energies from around 50 mev onwards .    while the predictions of the two models for @xmath73 are rather similar ( cf . figs .",

    "indeed , for @xmath76 at low energies even the sign differs in case of the @xmath169 channel .",
    "obviously , here the variations in the hadronic amplitude are also reflected in large differences in the coulomb - nuclear interference term .    for the total @xmath75 ( including the hadronic and the coulomb - nuclear interference terms ) model a predicts a maximum of 12 mb at the beam energy @xmath232 mev whereas model d yields a maximum of practically the same magnitude at @xmath233 mev .",

    "the results for @xmath76 for @xmath156 scattering are comparable for both models , reaching a maximum of roughly 30 mb around @xmath237 mev .",

    "in this section we present numerical results for @xmath3 scattering employing the jlich models a and d @xcite for the elementary @xmath22 interactions . in order to estimate the role of the double - scattering mechanism , which will be not taken into account in our calculation of the polarized total cross sections",

    "@xcite , in forward elastic scattering of antiprotons off nuclei the glauber theory , though in principle a high - energy approach , works rather well even at fairly low antiproton beam energies like 50 mev .",
    "this has to be compared with proton - nucleus scattering where the glauber theory is known to give reliable results only for energies in the order of 1 gev or above .",
    "the glauber theory is applicable at such low energies , because of the presence of annihilation channels in the @xmath238 interaction .",
    "due to strong annihilation effects , specifically in the @xmath239-waves , higher partial waves start to play an important role already fairly close to threshold . as a consequence , the @xmath22 elastic differential cross section is peaked in forward direction already at rather low energies @xcite and , therefore , suitable for application of the eikonal approximation , which is the basis of the glauber theory .",
    "in other words it can be seen from the optical theorem that the higher the annihilation cross section is , the larger is the modulus of the forward elastic scattering amplitude .",
    "indeed , the elastic spin - averaged @xmath22 scattering amplitude can be very well parameterized by @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the total unpolarized @xmath22 cross section , @xmath242 is the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath243 , @xmath244 is the slope of the diffraction cone , @xmath245 is the transferred 3-momentum , and @xmath134 is the @xmath22 cms momentum .",

    "but the shadowing effect generated by the @xmath22 double - scattering mechanism reduces the cross section by about that amount so that the final result ( solid line ) is in good agreement with the experiment . the results for model a are very similar .",

    "in the present paper we employed two @xmath19 potential models developed by the jlich group for a calculation of unpolarized @xmath3 scattering within the glauber - sitenko theory and found that this approach allows one to describe the experimental information on differential and total @xmath3 cross sections , available at @xmath255 mev , quantitatively . for those spin - independent observables the difference in the predictions based on those two models turned out to be rather small .",
    "the double - scattering corrections to the unpolarized cross section were found to be in the order of 15% in the energy range where the data are available .",
