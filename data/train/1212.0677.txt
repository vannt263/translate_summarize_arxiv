    "the authors also considered values of adsorbed polymer higher or lower than the equilibrium adsorbed amount . when the adsorbed amount was lower than the equilibrium one , the attraction was weaker . however , when the adsorbed amount was higher than the equilibrium one , the results show stronger attraction between the walls and also appearance of strong long - ranged repulsion , similar to those shown in fig .",

    "our modelling results , theoretical consideration and literature analysis @xcite show that the attractive interactions between if at low salt content occur only when @xmath89 or the if surfaces are slightly overcharged .",

    "the charge on the surface was then adjusted to neutralize the charge from the chains , @xmath92 for the aa model and @xmath93 for the pg model .",
    "when only n chains are present , the minimum becomes much deeper and is shifted closer to the surface .",
    "even with the addition of @xmath94 of salt this attraction minimum is still quite deep ( data not shown ) .",
    "the more hydrophobic n tails behave as a `` glue '' , holding together the two surfaces .",
    "in contrast , the c tails behave in the opposite way .",
    "the interaction potentials for a similar model including c - tails only result in much smaller attraction minimum , pushed away from the surface .",
    "the more polar c - tails contribute much less to the attraction between the if surfaces .",
    "it is tempting to propose that both n and c domains play important roles in the structure and interactions of skin keratin ifs . the more hydrophobic",
    "n chains bring about a strong attraction between the if surfaces while the more polar c tails push the surfaces away from each other , so that the two types of domains work together to keep ifs at the optimal separation .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is the combination of both types of the domains balances the interactions between the intermediate filaments .",
    "we have applied the scf approach to study interactions of the unstructured n and c terminal domains of skin keratin ( k1/k10 ) intermediate filaments .",
    "positively charged n and c domains were grafted onto negatively charged if cores , represented by planar surfaces .",
    "we have considered two models for n and c tails , characterized by a different level of detail : the coarse block - copolymer pg model and the more detailed aa model , which is based on the amino acid sequence . in spite of the apparent simplicity of the pg model",
    ", it qualitatively captures most of the effects observed for the more complex aa model .",
    "we have presented monomer density profiles for the n and c tails and , separately , profiles for their basic residues only .",
    "we have compared and discussed interaction potential profiles for if surfaces with attached tails at various surface charge densities , ionic strengths , and for the solution of free amino acids representing nmf .",
    "we have also attempted to clarify the role of each type of terminal domains considering n and c chains separately .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows .",
    "\\(a ) volume fraction profiles for n and c domains show that the monomers of both types of the chains are mostly concentrated near the surface , so the chain extension does not exceed @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "the basic residues of the terminal domains , which are located near the end of the chains , have the highest density at the ( oppositely charged ) surface ( fig .  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "these results indicate that the chains form either loops or bridges with another surface .",
    "such bridges lead to attractive interactions between the two if surfaces at short separations .",
    "n tails are more hydrophobic and the profiles for n tails are more narrow compared to those for c tails and extend for no more than @xmath96 from the surface .",
    "the interaction potential for surfaces covered by n domain type only reveals that the attractive interactions between the surfaces are stronger than those when both types of the domains considered together and appear at shorter separations ( fig .",
    "so we conclude that n tails work as the `` glue '' between if surfaces .",
    "c tails are slightly more polar than n tails and extend slightly further into the solution ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the interactions between surfaces with only c tails grafted show much weaker and more long - ranged attraction .",
    "so , we propose that c chains are `` responsible '' for keeping a certain distance between if . hence",
    ", each type of the terminal domains has its specific role and their combination retain if at certain distance .",
    "\\(b ) when the charge of the if surface is neutralized by the charge on the grafted chains and the ionic strength is low , ifs experience attractive force between each other at surface separations @xmath98@xmath99 ( 6@xmath100 ) due to bridging effect of grafted terminal domains . this attraction becomes weaker and turns into repulsion with increase of ionic strength as a result of electrostatic screening .",
    "the repulsion become stronger and longer ranged when simple aqueous electrolyte solution between the if surfaces is replaced by a complex `` broth '' of amino acids  a coarse grained representation of nmf in 30% water .",
    "however , we can not confirm experimental observations of jokura _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite that neutral amino acids alone produce a similar effect .",
    "we have found that charged small species such as ions or charged amino acids are necessary components of nmf and their role is to decrease electrostatic forces between if .",
    "the effect of salt when ions differ not only by their charge but also by size should be investigated using more complicated model for salt molecules or / and by other simulation methods .",
    "\\(c ) at low ionic strength the attraction between the if surfaces can be obtained only when the charge on the surface is fully compensated by the charge on the chains and ions .",
    "that occurs only when the surface charge is equal or slightly higher than the charge of the grafted terminal domains .",
    "therefore , we propose that : ( i ) negative charge of the if helical part is equal in absolute value or slightly higher than the positive charge of the if terminal domains ; ( ii ) the function of nmf is to prevent the attractive forces between protruding terminal domains and if helical cores .",
