    "copper compounds have been extensively studied as spin-@xmath7 quantum magnets , material prototypes of quantum spin models .",
    "while local properties of these compounds are usually similar and involve nearly isotropic heisenberg spins , the variability of the magnetic behavior stems from the unique structural diversity . depending on the particular arrangement of the magnetic cu@xmath8 atoms and their ligands in the crystal structure , different spin lattices can be formed . presently , experimental examples for many of simple lattice geometries , including the uniform chain,@xcite square lattice,@xcite shastry - sutherland lattice of orthogonal spin dimers,@xcite and kagom lattice,@xcite are available and actively studied .",
    "some of the copper compounds feature more complex spin lattices@xcite that have not been anticipated in theoretical studies , yet trigger the theoretical research@xcite once relevant material prototypes are available .    owing to the competition between ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) contributions to the exchange couplings ,",
    "compounds of particular interest are those with m - x - m bridging angles close to 90@xmath5 , with m being a transition metal and x being a ligand .",
    "such geometries are realized in the quasi-1d cuprates featuring chains of edge - sharing cuo@xmath9 plaquettes , which represent a simple example of low - dimensional spin-1/2 magnetic materials .",
    "independent of the sign of the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) coupling @xmath2 , its competition with the sizeable afm next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) coupling @xmath3 leads to magnetic frustration . depending on the ratio @xmath10 , such compounds exhibit exotic magnetic behavior like helical order,@xcite spin - peierls transition@xcite or quantum critical behavior.@xcite the difficulties in the microscopic description of such compounds originate from ambiguities and @xmath3=0 . in this case",
    ", the model is reduced to a uniform heisenberg chain . in the other limit ,",
    "@xmath2=0 with an afm @xmath3 , the system reduces to two decoupled uniform heisenberg chains .",
    "although the @xmath10 ratios are very different for these two cases , the physics is the same . ] in the experimental estimates of the ratio @xmath10 , leading to controversial modeling of the magnetic structure.@xcite thus , the combination of different sets of experimental data with a careful theoretical analysis of the individual exchange pathways is of crucial importance for obtaining a precise microscopic magnetic model .",
    "however , the search for new quantum magnets , as well as the work on existing materials , require not only the ability to estimate the couplings but also a solid understanding of the nexus between crystallographic features of the material and ensuing magnetic couplings .",
    "the goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka)@xcite rules are a generic and well - established paradigm that prescribes fm couplings for bridging angles close to 90@xmath5 and afm couplings else , where the bridging angle refers to the m  x  m pathway . in cu@xmath8 oxides , generally the gka rules successfully explain the crossover between the fm and afm interactions for cu ",
    "o  cu angles close to 90@xmath5 .",
    "the boundary between the fm and afm regimes is usually within the range of @xmath11,@xcite but may considerably be altered by side groups and distortions.@xcite    in addition to cu@xmath8 oxides , the systems of interest include copper halides,@xcite carbodiimides,@xcite and other compound families .",
    "although microscopic arguments behind the gka rules should be also applicable to these non - oxide materials , the critical angles separating the fm and afm regimes , as well as the role of the ligand in general , are still little explored .",
    "moreover , the low number of experimentally studied compounds impedes a comprehensive experimental analysis available for oxides .    more and more , density functional theory ( dft ) electronic structure calculations complement experimental studies and deliver accurate estimates of magnetic couplings.@xcite they are especially well suited for the study of magnetostructural correlations , as both real and fictitious crystal structures can be considered in a calculation .",
    "however , in a periodic structure the effect of a single geometrical parameter is often difficult to elucidate , because different geometrical features are intertwined and evolve simultaneously upon the variation of an atomic position .",
    "geometrical effects on the local magnetic coupling are better discerned in cluster models that represent a small group of magnetic atoms and , ideally , a single exchange pathway .",
    "additional advantages of cluster models , owing to their low number of correlated atoms , are lower computational costs and , most important , their potential for the application of parameter - free wavefunction - based computational methods , i.e. in a strict sense @xmath12 @xmath13 calculations . by contrast ,",
    "presently available band - structure methods for calculating strongly correlated compounds rely on empirical parameters and corrections where their choice is in general not unambiguous.@xcite",
    "there have been several attempts to describe the local properties of solids with clusters especially in combination with @xmath12 @xmath13 quantum - chemical methods.@xcite however , the construction of clusters is far from being trivial .",
    "on one side , to make the calculations computationally feasible , the number of quantum mechanically treated atoms has to be kept as small as possible . on the other side ,",
    "accurate results require that these atoms experience the `` true '' crystal potential .",
    "usually , this is achieved by embedding the cluster into a cloud of point charges@xcite and so called total ion potentials.@xcite but even for involved embeddings it was demonstrated , that the choice of the cluster may have significant effects on the results of the calculations and , thus , size - convergence has to be checked thoroughly.@xcite    here , we study the effect of geometrical parameters on the magnetic exchange in cu@xmath8 halides .",

    "f bonds , to chlorine and bromine that produce largely covalent compounds with cu@xmath8.@xcite presently , we do not consider iodine because no cu@xmath8 iodides have been reported . in our modeling",

    "we further perform a comparative analysis for clusters and additionally consider the problem of long - range couplings .",
    "the evaluation of such couplings requires larger clusters , thus posing a difficulty for the cluster approach .",
    "the observed trends for the magnetic exchange as a function of the bridging angle are analyzed from the microscopic viewpoint , and reveal the crucial role of covalency that underlies salient differences between the ionic cu@xmath8 fluorides and largely covalent chlorides and bromides .",
    "on the experimental side , the compounds and crystal structures under consideration are relevant to the cucl@xmath1 and cubr@xmath1 materials that show interesting examples of frustrated heisenberg chains.@xcite at low temperatures , these halides form helical magnetic structures and demonstrate improper ferroelectricity along with the strong magnetoelectric coupling.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    ", the transfer integral corresponds to half of the energy difference of the magnetic orbitals.@xcite these transfer integrals @xmath15 are further introduced into the half - filled single - band hubbard model @xmath16 that is eventually reduced to the heisenberg model for low - energy excitations , @xmath17 the reduction is well - justified in the strongly correlated limit @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the effective on - site coulomb repulsion , which exceeds @xmath15 by at least an order of magnitude ( see table  [ t_tj ] ) .",
    "this procedure yields afm contributions to the exchange evaluated as @xmath20 .    alternatively , the full exchange couplings @xmath21 , comprising fm and afm contributions , can be derived from total energies of collinear magnetic arrangements evaluated in spin - polarized supercell calculations axis with p2/m symmetry and five cu - sites defines the supercell .",
    "three different arrangements of the spins localized on the cu - sites were sufficient to calculate all presented @xmath21 : two with the spin on one cu - site flipped and one with the spins on two cu - sites flipped ( see supplemental material@xcite ) .",

    "we use a local spin - density approximation ( lsda)+@xmath0 scheme in combination with a unit cell quadrupled along the @xmath28 axis and a @xmath29-mesh of 64 points . the on - site repulsion and exchange amount to @xmath30=7@xmath310.5ev and @xmath32=1ev , respectively .",

    "the deviations ( @xmath103% ) , depending on the bridging angle and @xmath33 , slightly shift the bs states and thus affect the exchange couplings .",

    "x  cu pathways can be illustrated but also challenged by several experimental observations .",
    "it should be emphasized that ferromagnetic nn coupling requires not only sizeable ferromagnetic contributions but also small transfer integrals as were found for cucl@xmath1  and cubr@xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , the afm contributions will outweigh the fm terms even for covalent compounds .",
    "experimental data for cu@xmath8 chlorides and bromides indeed show the robust fm nn coupling for the bridging angles below @xmath63 .",
    "while the @xmath104 regime is not typical for the ionic oxides and fluorides , it is abundant in covalent systems and observed , e.g. , in cu - based fm spin chains.@xcite the fm nature of the nn coupling at @xmath105 is evidenced by cucl@xmath1 and cubr@xmath1 themselves.@xcite however , larger @xmath4 values are less common and require geometries other than the edge - sharing cux@xmath1 chains considered in the present study .",

    "our results identify the cu ",

    "the fact that the magnetostructural correlations weakly depend on the procedure of varying @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ j_ang_o ] ) entails the minor role of direct cu  cu interactions , because the coupling always evolves in a similar fashion , no matter whether the cu ",

    "although these compounds are still deep in the insulating regime , far from the mott transition ( @xmath18 , see table  [ t_tj ] ) , the sizable hybridization of ligand states with correlated cu @xmath44 orbitals challenges the dft+@xmath0 approach , with correlation effects restricted to the @xmath53 states .",
    "the microscopic evaluation of magnetic couplings in cu@xmath8 chlorides and bromides indeed leads to large uncertainties.@xcite hybrid functionals , on the other hand , tend to overestimate magnetic exchange couplings@xcite and provide a working , but empirical solution to the problem of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "this calls for the development and application of alternative techniques , as for instance _ ab initio _ quantum - chemical calculations , appropriately accounting for strong electron correlations .",
    "since the wavefunction - based quantum - chemical calculations are presently restricted to finite systems , they require the construction of appropriate clusters . this task has been successfully accomplished in our work .",
