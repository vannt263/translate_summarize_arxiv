    "the physics of light propagation is a topic of active research , due to its relevance to several technological applications and basic research .",
    "recent research on new materials has shown that it is possible to exercise an extraordinary control on the propagation of light pulses , which in turn has generated new interest in both practical and fundamental questions on light propagation . moreover , despite the fact that maxwell completed the formulation of the classical theory of electromagnetism in 1864 and einstein s special theory of relativity was presented in 1905 , some hot controversies continue to arise on the subject of superluminal propagation @xcite and its possible implications for both classical and quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "recent reviews on the subject can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite    one consequence of the special theory of relativity is that no signal can cause an effect outside the light cone of its source .",
    "violation of this principle of relativistic causality leads to paradoxes such as that of an effect preceding its cause @xcite .",
    "when dealing with light propagation in a material characterized by a given dispersion relation @xmath0 between the frequency @xmath1 and the wave vector @xmath2 , several _ velocities _ may be defined , such as the _ phase velocity _ @xmath3 and the _ group velocity _ @xmath4 .",
    "it is recognized that under certain conditions @xcite both velocities can exceed the speed of light in vacuum @xmath5 .",
    "this does not contradict the postulates of the special theory of relativity , for it has been recognized since the works of sommerfeld @xcite and brillouin @xcite that in order not to violate the principle of causality it is the _ information velocity _ that must not exceed @xmath5 .",
    "the question that arises then is what is an appropriate and operative definition of _ information velocity_. there have been several discussions and proposals on this subject , but the question is not yet settled @xcite .    the vast majority of the published work concerning superluminal pulse propagation deals with light propagation in material media , and the usual analysis attempts to explain how the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the medium affects the propagation of light pulses in such a way that they appear to travel superluminally . in a pioneering paper @xcite ,",
    "icsevgi and lamb performed a theoretical investigation of the propagation of intense laser pulses through a laser amplifier .",
    "apparent superluminal light propagation has been reported in gain - assisted systems @xcite as well as in birefringent crystals @xcite , composite media and photonic crystals @xcite and dispersive media @xcite .",
    "there have also been claims of evidence of superluminal propagation in free space @xcite and during _ optical tunneling _ in frustrated total internal reflection ( ftir ) configurations @xcite .",
    "optical tunneling has been studied by several authors , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "some of the observed results are still subject of debatable interpretation @xcite and do not close the subject of whether there are possibilities for superluminal transmission of information in such systems .",
    "we have therefore chosen to address this subject in way that leads to straightforward interpretation of the results while resorting only to classical electromagnetic theory .",
    "we claim that although some results may _ appear _ to indicate superluminal propagation , there is no real superluminal transfer of information .    in this paper",
    "we analyze mathematically the propagation of a pulse across a vacuum gap separating opposite flat parallel faces of two transparent dielectrics by means of an explicitly causal and retarded propagator constructed directly from the free - space wave equation .",
    "our results yield indeed an apparent superluminal propagation corresponding to the conditions of ftir , but they show explicitly that it is consistent with both casuality and with classical electrodynamics .",
    "our example shows superluminality effects inherent to light pulse propagation in free space which therefore does not depend on the particulars of light - matter interaction .",
    "the _ illusion _ of superluminality consists of transmitted pulses arriving to the far side of the gap in synchrony with the crossing of the front surface by the incident pulse .",
    "we explain this illusion of superluminal behavior in terms of a causal , subluminal propagation , taking into account the spatial extent of the incident pulse along its transverse as well as its longitudinal directions and we propose experiments to demonstrate the retarded nature of propagation in ftir .",
    "nevertheless , we find that for constrained pulses fully made up of evanescent fourier components , subluminal and superluminal propagation in ftir experiments are indistinguishable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce a propagator that will allow the analyzis of electromagnetic pulse propagation across a vacuum gap ( section [ secpropagator ] ) .",
    "this propagator is both casual and retarded and complies with the classical electromagnetic theory .",
    "we then study the propagation across the gap of pulses that arrive as plane waves with well defined angles of incidence . in section [ secnormal ]",
    "we study the case of subcritical angles , yielding non - evanescent transmitted waves . in section [ secevan ]",
    "we study the case of hypercritical angles , yielding evanescent waves .",
    "we conclude that the propagation of a light pulse in a ftir configuration may appear superluminal and acausal but that it is actually subluminal and that propagation has to account necessarily for the lateral wings of the incident pulse . in section [ secscreens ]",
    "we suggest experiments that might demonstrate the actual causal and subluminal nature of the apparent superluminal behavior by using sharp opaque screens that block parts of the incident wave so that its extent becomes finite along both its propagation and its transverse directions .",
    "nevertheless , as the borders of these screens produce propagating diffracted waves , in section [ secsmooth ] we eliminate them and we study incident pulses that are finite along several spatial directions but that have a smooth profile . we obtain that if they are comprised of evanescent fourier components only , they appear to propagate superluminally through the vacuum gap , even though their behavior is determined by our causal retarded propagator . in section [ secevprop ]",
    "we construct an alternative acausal , superluminal propagator , and prove that it is exactly equivalent to the causal and retarded propagator when applied to fully evanescent finite pulses .",
    "thus , for such constrained pulses , it is impossible to distinguish causal subluminal from acausal and superluminal propagation ; the illusion of superluminality appears to be not only a matter of interpretation of the _ result _ of the propagation , but may be also present in the description of the propagation process itself .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ secconclusion ] .",
    "consider two transparent dielectrics occupying the regions @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in this section",
    "we obtain the causal and retarded propagator that describes the motion of a pulse across a vacuum gap @xmath8 spanning from the interface at @xmath9 to that at @xmath10 ( fig . [ normal ] ) .",
    "pulse with arbitrary profile incident at an angle @xmath11 onto the surface @xmath9 of a dielectric with index of refraction @xmath12 .",
    "the pulse is transmitted into a vacuum gap and into a second dielectric at @xmath10 .",
    "the speed of propagation within each media , @xmath13 and @xmath5 , are indicated , as well as the speed of propagation of the wavefronts along the interfaces @xmath14 . ]    as we want to consider explicitly the angle of incidence onto the interface @xmath9 , we can not treat the problem beforehand as if it were 1d . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume full translational symmetry along the @xmath15 direction , so that our problem becomes 2d .",
    "thus , we start with the scalar wave equation @xmath16 with a unit singular point source fired at time @xmath17 at position @xmath18 , which is solved by the explicitly causal and retarded free space green s function @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the heaviside unit step function . using image theory",
    "we can construct a green s function that obeys dirichlet boundary conditions at the surface @xmath9 , @xmath21 in the half - space @xmath22 green s theorem yields the solution @xcite @xmath23 of the homogeneous scalar wave equation that is outgoing as @xmath24 and is null in the remote past , where @xmath25 denotes its previous values on the boundary @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the causal retarded propagator of the problem .",
    "we may identify the field @xmath28 with the component @xmath29 of the electric field @xmath30 in the case of a te or @xmath31 polarized incoming wave , and with the component @xmath32 of the magnetic field @xmath33 in the case of tm or @xmath34 polarization .",
    "the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) does not account for the presence of the two dielectrics bounding the air gap .",
    "thus , the field ( [ propagate ] ) has no information about the multiple reflections at the boundary of the gap . in principle , these can be incorporated by reflecting the field at the interfaces @xmath35 using the appropriate fresnel coefficient and propagating it back and forth across the gap with the propagator ( [ propagator ] ) for the @xmath9 surface and a similar one for the @xmath10 surface .",
    "the total field would then be the sum of all the multiply reflected fields and would have information about the electromagnetic properties of the reflecting surfaces . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to an analysis of the first crossing of the air gap @xmath36 , and thus our results will be unrelated to the nature of the bounding media .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) into ( [ g ] ) and ( [ propagator ] ) we obtain @xmath37 the field @xmath28 can then be written in terms of an ancillary function @xmath38 where @xmath39 plays the role of a potential and the integration is performed within the region @xmath40 .",
    "clearly , the procedure above yields a causal ( sub)luminal propagation from the @xmath26 plane to any point in the @xmath22 vacuum .",
    "we consider now that an arbitrarily shaped pulse impinges _ at a well defined angle _",
    "@xmath41 on the inside surface @xmath42 of a homogeneous non - dispersive dielectric with index of refraction @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ normal ] ) .",
    "the incident pulse is therefore described by an arbitrary function @xmath44 $ ] of a single variable @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a unit vector pointing along the angle of incidence @xmath41 and @xmath47 .",
    "notice that in this case the incident wavefronts have an infinite extension in the direction normal to @xmath48 . at @xmath26 and after being transmitted into vacuum , the outgoing field can therefore be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is related to the arbitrary function @xmath51 and the fresnel amplitude for transmission from the dielectric into vacuum . as we are concerned only with propagation across the vacuum gap",
    ", we will take @xmath50 as given and we will disregard its relation with @xmath51 , which would involve the dielectric properties of the incident medium .    the intersection of the pulse with the interface @xmath9 is therefore seen to travel along @xmath52 with velocity @xmath53 ( not to be confused with the parallel component of the incident velocity @xmath54 ) . for incidence angles smaller than the critical angle @xmath55 , @xmath56 and we have normal transmission , while for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and total internal reflection ensues .    in order to set up a reference with which to compare the evanescent case , in this section we employ our propagator to study a non - evanescent plane pulse .",

    "the results of the previous section suggest an experiment that could confirm that propagation of evanescent waves in the ftir geometry is not superluminal nor acausal . the experiment could be performed simply by partially covering the surface of the first interface with a couple of opaque screens as shown in fig .",

    "its maximum duration @xmath227 and size @xmath228 are @xmath229 for a fixed position and fixed observation time respectively , and it contains altogether about six nodes .    surprisingly , after crossing the gap , the pulse looks essentially the same ! it appears at the back @xmath10 face of the air gap at roughly the same time and the same position as at the front @xmath9 face .",
    "it also peaks at the origin at @xmath225 and disappears from the back surface in concordance to the incident pulse on the front face .",
    "thus , it truly appears to propagate instantaneously .",
    "the main difference between the incident and transmitted pulse is that the intensity of the later is suppressed by 12 orders of magnitude .",
    "another interesting difference is that the number of visible nodes in the transmitted pulse has decreased to about 4 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in ftir , the fourier components with higher frequencies are more damped than those with lower frequencies .",
    "finally , a more subtle difference is that the speed of propagation along the back face is slightly but noticeably larger than that on the front face .",
    "this is due to the fact that plane waves incident at angles closer to @xmath230 have a larger penetration length than waves incident at larger angles .",
    "thus , the angle of propagation of the transmitted pulse is smaller than that of the incident wave @xcite .    in sec .",

    "the peak of the transmitted pulse appears in the regions of largest overlap between the different widened transmitted components , i.e. , at the regions where their centers coincide .",
    "the peak of the transmitted pulse at the back face of the air gap is seen to appear at the same time as the peak of the incident pulse reaches the front surface .",
    "thus , it would seem as if the peak tunneled instantaneously in the direction normal to the gap .",
    "however , in the previous sections we have shown that each of the transmitted components of the transmitted wave originates causally from regions in the lateral wings of the incident pulse .",
    "thus , the peak of the transmitted field does not actually originate from the peak of the incident field ; it is formed by contributions from the lateral wings of the incident field , which reach the front face of the air gap first .",
    "the lateral wings of each component have enough time to cross the gap traveling at speed @xmath5 and combine to form the relatively small transmitted peak right at the time when the larger incident peak reaches the front surface .",
    "similarly , the different components of the field produced by the peak of the incident pulse get out of step as they cross the air gap and , therefore , do not contribute to the peak of the transmitted pulse , but rather , to its lateral wing .",

    "both yield exactly the same transmitted pulse when the incident pulse contains only evanescent components .",

    "the validity of the argument above in the presence of thermal or quantum noise has to be investigated .",
    "to study the propagation of a light pulse through a vacuum gap between two parallel dielectrics in a ftir configuration we constructed a propagator derived directly from the wave equation resulting from maxwell s equations .",
