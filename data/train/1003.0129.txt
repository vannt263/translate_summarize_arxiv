    "signatures of the past recurrent activity in nuclei of normal galaxies were presented by @xcite , but their paper was not really noticed and has only 24 citations to date .",
    "@xcite examined quasar models and suggested that their accumulate the mass during quiescent periods and then through the instability they transfer the mass onto a central black hole during a short period of an outburst of the activity .",
    "these are just a few examples of the agn intermittency that has been considered since the early days of studies of the nuclear emission in galaxies .",
    "it is now that we are looking closely at this behaviour as it becomes evident that it is an important component to our understanding of the evolution of structures in the universe . however , there are still many open questions about the origin of the intermittent behaviour .",
    "is it related to the unsteady fuel supply , or accretion flow ?",
    "are there many quiescent and outburst phases ? what is the mechanism regulating the intermittent behaviour ?",
    "observations show a range of timescales for the agn outbursts .",

    "many recently discovered x - ray jets associated with powerful quasars the continuous x - ray jet emission extends to hundreds of kpc distances from the core @xcite .",
    "these jets are straight , sometimes curved or bent , and have many knots .",
    "for example in pks  1127 - 145 jet associated with z=1.18 quasar the separation and size of the knots may indicate separate outbursts of jet activity with timescales @xmath5  years @xcite .",
    "host galaxy scale jets , smaller than @xmath6  kpc provide a direct information about the jet interactions with the ism and feedback .",
    "compact radio sources that are entirely contained within the host galaxy represent the initial phase of radio source growth and they are young .",
    "the most compact gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources have linear radio sizes below @xmath7  kpc .",
    "their age can be probed directly by studying the expansion velocity of symmetric radio structures and it is typically less than @xmath8  years @xcite .",
    "compact steep spectrum ( css ) radio sources are slightly larger , but still contained within the host galaxy .",
    "their age is given by synchrotron ageing measurements and is smaller than @xmath9  years @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observatory observations of a complete sample of compact gps galaxies .",

    "the gps sources cover an upper right corner of that diagram and the plotted regression lines indicate possible evolutionary path for the gps sources to grow into large scale radio sources .",
    "however , it is unclear which way and how the evolution of the gps radio sources proceeds .",
    "are they fade in radio and x - rays simultaneously or maybe only the radio fades while the x - ray emission remains unchanged indicating that the x - ray emission process is independent of the radio one ? on the other hand maybe the gps sources remain in this part of the diagram due to repetitive outbursts .",
    "@xcite show that there is an overabundance of compact radio sources , so they need to be short - lived or intermittent rather then evolving in a self - similar manner to explain their numbers .",
    "@xcite proposed a phenomenological model with the recurrent outbursts on timescales between @xmath10  years lasting for @xmath11 years that fits the observed numbers of radio sources and their sizes .",

    "accretion disk instabilities have been studied and shown to operate in binary systems . the ionization instability that causes large amplitude ( @xmath13 ) outbursts in galactic binaries on timescales between 1 and 1000 years may operate in accretion disks around supermassive black holes .",

    "this model includes the outflow that transports away the excess heating energy allowing the disk to transfer to a lower temperature stable state @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the luminosity variations due to the radiation pressure instability occurring in a disk around @xmath19 black hole with a steady flow of matter with the rate @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the critical accretion rate corresponding to the eddington luminosity .",

    "the outbursts timescales and durations are different . in general the effects of the instability",
    "depend on the size of the unstable disk region which scales with accretion rate . also , there is a lower limit to the accretion rate for this instability to operate because the radiation pressure instability occurs when @xmath23 in the systems with @xmath24 and accretion rates below a few percent of the critical eddington accretion rates the instability does not occur and the disk is stable .",
    "we associate the outbursts caused by the radiation pressure instability with the ejections of radio jets .",

    "there are several implications of the intermittent jet activity .",
    "the repetitive outbursts have potentially a very strong impact on the ism",
    ". the repetitive shocks on timescales shorter than the relaxation timescales may keep the ism warm , and also more efficiently drive the gas out of the host galaxy .",
    "there exists an intrinsic limit to the size of a radio source given by the timescales .",
    "evolution of a radio source proceeds in a non self - similar way .",
    "the outbursts repeat regularly every @xmath26 years .",
    "the jet turns - off between each outburst .",
    "each radio structure may represent one outbursts and a young source will indicate a new outburst .",
    "however , the timescales for fading of a radio source are longer than the separation timescales between the outbursts , and we should observe the fossil radio structure in addition to the compact one .",
    "10% of gps sources have faint radio emission on large scales , that is typically explained as a relic of the other active phase @xcite .    what is the radio source evolution between the outbursts ?",
    "the jet turns - off between each outburst and then the pressure driven expansion continues until the radio source energy is comparable to the thermal energy of the heated medium . if the outburst lasts about @xmath27  years then the radio source does not expand beyond the host galaxy .",
    "the hot spots can only travel to a distance of @xmath28  pc before the jet turns off and then the pressure driven expansion drives the radio structure only to a distance of 3  kpc for the typical ism density and jet power . at this point",
    "the re - collapse of the radio source starts and it continues for about a myr if there is no another outburst . in order for the source to escape",
    "its host galaxy the outburst needs to last longer than @xmath29  years .    re -",
    "collapse phase is typically longer than the repetition timescale and a `` tunnel '' made by the jet will not close between outbursts .",
    "it means that the repetitive jets outbursts will propagate into a rarified medium .",
    "as the timescales between outbursts are long we expect to observe fading compact radio sources with no active nucleus .    for high accretion rates ( @xmath30 )",
    "the jet outbursts can be governed by the radiation pressure instabilities . the observed radio power suggests high accretion rates that are consistent with the requirement for the instability to operate .",
    "thus the number of compact size radio sources with can be explained by the outbursts with timescales consistent with the radiation pressure instability .",
    "there are some open issues related to the theoretical understanding of the disk instability .",
    "the effects of the instability depend on the disk viscosity .",
    "the standard @xcite disk is unstable in the case of viscosity scaling with total pressure while it is stable for the viscosity scaled with the gas pressure . in the case of the mri viscosity",
    "the local disk simulations support some scaling of the effective torque with pressure .",
    "however , the effect of the radiation pressure instability is not clear in the global mhd simulations , although very recent simulations by @xcite confirm the existence of the instability .",
    "observationally the behaviour of microquasars strongly supports the radiation pressure explanation for the outbursts .",
    "observations indicate a complex behaviour of radio sources : continuous jets , signatures of repetitive outbursts in separated radio components , or the statistic of radio sources .",
    "the source complex behaviour may reflect different regimes of the accretion flow that depend on the black hole mass and accretion rate .",
    "we also note that for some parameters the radio source may never leave the host galaxy .",
    "large samples of radio sources are needed for statistical studies .",
    "we should be able to determine the number of sources , their lifetimes and sizes .",
    "we also need more sources with measurements of their age as well as indications for the intermittency in the sources radio morphology .",
