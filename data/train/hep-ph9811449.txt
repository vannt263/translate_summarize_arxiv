    "the qcd sum rules @xcite for the masses of the excited heavy meson doublet @xmath4 of spin parity @xmath5 have been studied in @xcite , where the indices @xmath6 denote the parity and spin of the light component @xmath7 .",
    "recently the @xmath8 correction to the @xmath9 sum rule has been calculated in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the masses of the @xmath5 , together with those of the doublet @xmath10 were calculated up to the order of @xmath11 in the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mass of the the doublet in the leading order of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the parity and spin of the light component of the heavy mesons in the doublet .",
    "the results in @xcite in the leading order of @xmath16 are @xmath17gev if the usual interpolating current of the lowest dimension is used and @xmath18gev . within errors",
    "the results in @xcite are consistent with these results .",
    "this would imply that @xmath19 state lies @xmath20 mev above @xmath21 state .",
    "the @xmath11 corrections calculated in @xcite does not change much this mass difference .",
    "this result is inconsistent with the new experimental data @xcite where @xmath22 is about @xmath23 mev larger than @xmath9 .",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath24 corrections can account for this discrepancy .",
    "recently blok et al . made the following observation @xcite . due to the @xmath25-wave nature of the @xmath0 intermediate state and the large coupling of the soft goldstone particle ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 continuum to the spectral density in the correlator of two @xmath19 currents is unusually large .",
    "it rises faster than the quark - gluon spectral density in the low energy region and exceeds it in magnitude in that region .",
    "thus , it may violate the naive quark - hadron duality if we integrate the spectra over a region below the lowest pole .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that this is the reason for the abnormal large value of the residue of the pole @xcite obtained in the standard `` lowest pole plus parton - like continuum model '' for the qcd sum rules .",
    "therefore , a better approach is to include the @xmath0 continuum in the soft pion region in addition to the lowest @xmath26 pole in the sum rule .    in this note",
    "we shall study in detail this effect in the sum rules for @xmath27 and the residue of the @xmath26 pole . besides",
    ", the decay rates of @xmath26 and @xmath28 have been studied in @xcite with the light cone qcd sum rules ( lcqsr ) @xcite . in view of the duality violation effect due to the intermediate states of @xmath0 continuum in the sum rule we shall also re - investigate the lcqsr for pion coupling of the @xmath1 doublet including the contribution of @xmath0 states .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is a short review of previous sum rules .",
    "new qcd sum rules with intermediate state contribution and the numerical analyses are presented in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "the last section is a short summary .",
    "the interpolating current for the doublets @xmath29 reads @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the heavy quark field in hqet , @xmath33 is the heavy hadron velocity , @xmath34 , the indices @xmath35 in @xmath36 are the total angular momentum , the parity and the light component angular momentum respectively .",
    "note there is a factor of @xmath37 in the definitions of the interpolating currents in our previous work .",
    "we consider the correlator @xmath38 and define the overlapping amplitude @xmath39 as @xmath40    assuming the standard `` pole plus parton - like continuum '' model we get @xmath41 here @xmath42 , which is a factor @xmath43 smaller than the @xmath44 used in @xcite .",
    "we derive the sum rule for the @xmath1 doublet @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 .    using the following standard values for the condensates @xmath47 and with @xmath48 gev , @xmath49 gev we get from ( [ mass-0 ] ) @xmath50 @xmath51    for comparison here",
    "we also write down the sum rules for the @xmath52 doublet . @xmath53 where the following interpolating currents for the @xmath52 doublet are used @xmath54 these currents are also a factor @xmath55 larger than those in @xcite .",
    "let us define the decay amplitudes of the doublet @xmath1 in full qcd @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 for charged and neutral pion respectively .",
    "the structure @xmath59 vanishes in the @xmath60 limit .    in hqet",
    "these amplitudes have the simple form @xmath61 where @xmath62    for deriving the sum rules for @xmath3 we consider the correlator @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    again after invoking the naive quark - hadron duality we have the double dispersion relation : @xmath69    expressing ( [ cor-2 ] ) with the pion wave functions @xcite we obtain the lcqsr for @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71mev , @xmath72gev at the scale @xmath73gev , @xmath74 etc are the light cone pion wave functions defined by @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the first derivatives of @xmath78 , @xmath79 at @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 are the borel parameters .",
    "we choose @xmath85",
    ". therefore @xmath86 .",
    "at this point @xmath76 and @xmath77 vanish .",
    "the factor @xmath87 is used to subtract the parton - like continuum contribution with the continuum threshold @xmath88 .    correcting a numerical error in @xcite we obtain from ( [ final ] )",
    "we have the dispersion relation for ( [ cor-1 ] ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the spectral density in the limit @xmath93 . at the quark level , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the color number .    due to the spontaneous chiral symmetry",
    "breaking , there exist @xmath96 massless goldstone bosons , where @xmath97 is the light quark flavor number . the s - wave combination @xmath0 has the same quantum numbers as the @xmath26 meson .",
    "so the interpolating current ( [ curr1 ] ) `` sees '' both @xmath0 and @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , the contribution due to @xmath0 intermediate states should be included explicitly when we write the spectral density at the phenomenological side .",
    "otherwise the @xmath26 pole contribution will be overestimated leading to an abnormal large residue .",
    "@xmath98 where the first term is the @xmath26 pole and the @xmath99 is the @xmath0 intermediate states contribution .",
    "the excited states and the continuum contribution is denoted by the ellipse .",
    "we start from the full qcd lagrangian to derive @xmath99 . it was shown in @xcite that @xmath100 where the sum is over all the possible goldstone bosons , @xmath101mev",
    ", @xmath102 is the interpolating current of @xmath26 in full qcd , @xmath103 is defined as , @xmath104 in the last step of deriving ( [ rho_pi ] ) the soft pion theorem has been used to calculate the matrix element .",
    "@xmath105 moreover the chiral limit @xmath106 has been used for all the light quarks and the @xmath107 flavor symmetry has been used to relate the amplitudes for different goldstone bosons .",
    "the factor @xmath108 in ( [ rho_pi ] ) is the result of summing over these states .    letting @xmath109 , @xmath110 and taking the heavy quark limit , i.e. , @xmath111 , we have @xmath112 where we have used the relation @xmath113 in the leading order of @xmath14 .",
    "note @xmath99 is a linear function of @xmath114 while the free parton level spectral density @xmath115 in ( [ d - q-1 ] ) is quadratic in @xmath114 .",
    "the latter is suppressed compared with the former in the lower energy region .",
    "so the spectral density is significantly disturbed by the presence of light goldstone bosons . in ( [ rho_pi-1 ] )",
    "we have introduced the factor @xmath116 .",
    "the reason is that the soft pion theorem does not hold any more beyond the region @xmath117mev .",
    "moreover it was conjectured in @xcite that @xmath118 drops when the total energy of @xmath0 becomes larger than the mass of @xmath26 so that the quark - hadron duality is restored after integrating the energy over a larger interval from zero to the continuum threshold .",
    "note @xmath119mev and @xmath120mev due to nonzero current quark mass .",
    "so in realistic case only @xmath0 intermediate states contribute to @xmath99 in ( [ rho_pi-1 ] ) corresponding to @xmath121 .",
    "now we arrive at the new sum rules after making borel transformation : @xmath122 where @xmath88 is the continuum threshold .",
    "starting from @xmath88 we have modeled the phenomenological spectral density with the free parton - like one .",
    "similarly we can write the double dispersion relation in the leading order of hqet for ( [ cor-2 ] ) as @xmath123 where the ellipse denotes the subtraction terms .",
    "the pole term is @xmath124 and the contribution of the @xmath0 intermediate states in full qcd is @xmath125 using the soft pion limit and @xmath126 symmetry we find @xmath127 taking the heavy quark limit ( [ wsx ] ) is reduced to @xmath128    finally we have a new sum rule for @xmath3 : @xmath129      as input we need @xmath130 gev and @xmath131 gev@xmath132 at the order @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath134 and @xmath135 in @xcite were obtained by first applying the operator @xmath136 to ( [ mass-0 ] ) and ( [ mass-2 ] ) to extract @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which were then used to obtain @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively .",
    "here we use a different procedure which appears to be better .",
    "this involves with simultaneously varying the parameters @xmath141 etc to find the best fitting of the left hand side ( l.h.s . ) and right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the sum rules .",
    "we work at the region @xmath142gev for eq .",
    "( [ mass-1 ] ) , where the power correction is under control .",
    "we allow the continuum threshold to vary from @xmath143 gev to @xmath144gev .",
    "numerically we have @xmath145 @xmath146 with these parameters the left hand side and right hand side agree within five percent in the region @xmath147gev as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 . typically at @xmath148 gev the sum of the @xmath26 pole and @xmath0 intermediate states constitutes about @xmath149 of the whole sum rule .",
    "the continuum starting from @xmath88 is about @xmath150 .",
    "it is important to notice that the @xmath0 intermediate states contribute about @xmath151 to the left hand side of ( [ mass-1 ] ) .",
    "if we use this fitting method in the numerical analysis of the old sum rules ( [ mass-0 ] ) we reproduce the results in @xcite @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 note in @xcite no error is given for @xmath39 .",
    "the value and error in ( [ fff-3 ] ) is the result of our reanalysis .",
    "we see that both @xmath39 and @xmath155 are significantly reduced after taking into account @xmath0 intermediate states .",
    "we can also apply the fitting method to the analysis of the sum rules for the @xmath52 doublet .",
    "the fitted curve of the l.h.s . and the parton level curve of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ mass-2 ] ) are shown in fig . 2 in the region",
    "@xmath142gev with the following most suitable parameters @xmath156 . @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 with these parameters the fitting is excellent , typically with an accuracy within one percent in the large interval @xmath160gev as can be seen from fig .",
    "the central value of @xmath155 is about @xmath23 mev lower than that of @xmath161 , in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "now we are ready to extract @xmath3 . using the same pion wave functions as in @xcite we have @xmath162 where the error refers to the variations with @xmath163 and @xmath88 .",
    "and the central value corresponds to @xmath164gev and @xmath165gev .",
    "the variation of the left hand side of ( [ final-1 ] ) with @xmath163 and @xmath88 is presented in fig .",
    "finally we get @xmath166    the decay width formulas in the leading order of @xmath14 are @xmath167 @xmath168 in order to include the large @xmath14 correction in the kinematical factors , we use the decay width formulas with finite @xmath169 instead of ( [ dd-1 ] ) , ( [ dd-2 ] ) .",
    "@xmath170 @xmath171|\\vec q|_\\pi\\;.\\ ] ]    numerically we have @xmath172 @xmath173 with @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "in summary , we have reanalyzed the qcd sum rules for both the @xmath1 mass and its pionic decay amplitude .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath0 intermediate states in the soft pion region are investigated in detail .",
    "the spectral density is disturbed significantly by the presence of goldstone bosons . after subtracting the contribution of these intermediate states",
    ", we have obtained new results for the binding energy @xmath176 and decay widths for the @xmath1 doublet in the leading order of hqet .",
    "numerically @xmath177 , which is about @xmath23 mev smaller than @xmath178 extracted with the same fitting method , in good agreement with the most recent experimental data @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 decay width is around 250 mev , which remains to be larger than the experimental result @xmath179 mev in @xcite .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not clear at present .",
    "we want to point out that the same contamination from the goldstone bosons exists for the sum rules for the @xmath52 doublet @xcite .",
    "but in this case the @xmath0 intermediate states disturb the spectral density only slightly for they are in the d - wave state .    the errors for our numerical results given in sec .",
    "[ num-33 ] include only those from the variation of the borel parameter @xmath163 and the continuum thresold @xmath88 in the window .",
    "they do nt include those from the uncertainty of the condensates and intrinsic errors of the qcd sum rule approach . in our analysis",
    "we have neglected the contribution of @xmath0 intermediate states to the spectral density for @xmath180 since the soft pion theorem does not hold any more and there is not a reliable way to estimate the matrix element @xmath181 .",
    "this is another source of uncertainty .",
    "after we submitted the original version of this paper , we learned that cleo collaboration have measured the @xmath182 mass and width to be @xmath183 mev and @xmath184 mev respectively @xcite .",
