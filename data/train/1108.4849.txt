    "approximately 10% of isolated white dwarfs form with magnetic field strengths in excess of @xmath1 g@xcite . based on zeeman measurements , surface field strengths for these high - field magnetic white dwarfs ( hfmwds ) range from a few to slightly less than a thousand megagauss ( mg)@xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the bulk of isolated white dwarfs with measured weak fields or non - detection upper limits of typically @xmath2  g@xcite .",
    "if the magnetic field strengths of white dwarfs were independent of binary interactions , then the observed distribution of isolated wds should be similar to those in detached binaries .",
    "remarkably , _ not a single _ detached , binary system in which the primary is a wd and the companion is an m - dwarf contains a hfmwd@xcite . within 20 pc",
    ", there are 109 known wds ( 21 of which have a non - degenerate companion ) .",
    "sdss has identified 149 hfmwds ( _ none _ of which has a non - degenerate companion ) .",
    "the maximum probability of obtaining samples at least this different from the same underlying population , assuming binomial statistics@xcite , is @xmath3 .",
    "this suggests at the 6.2-@xmath4 level that the two populations are different .",
    "furthermore , sdss identified 1253 wd+m - dwarf binaries ( _ none _ of which are magnetic ) . as was previously suggested ,",
    "the presence or absence of binarity is crucial in influencing whether a hfmwd results@xcite .",
    "these results initially seem to indicate that hfmwds preferentially form when isolated .",
    "however , unless there is a mechanism by which very distant companions prevent the formation of a strong magnetic field , a more natural explanation is that highly - magnetized white dwarfs became that way by engulfing ( and removing ) their companions@xcite .",
    "in the binary scenario , the progenitors of hfmwds are those systems that incur a common envelope ( ce ) phase during post - ms evolution .",
    "magnetic cvs may be the progeny of common envelope systems that almost merge but eject the envelope , leaving a close binary .",
    "isolated hfmwds may result from systems with less massive companions  as suggested by recent observations . in this case",
    ", the companion ca nt eject the envelope and thus , continues to in - spiral until it tidally disrupts .",
    "the formation of an accretion disk can both amplify magnetic fields and transport them to the wd surface .",
    "recently , this scenario was suggested and quantitatively investigated as a way to produce an isolated hfmwd@xcite .",
    "figure 1 sketches the evolutionary pathway to forming an isolated hfmwd . a close ,",
    "m - dwarf+main - sequence binary will enter a common envelope when the primary leaves the main - sequence either through direct expansion or tidal engulfment@xcite .",
    "the m - dwarf continues to in - spiral toward the natal wd core until it tidally disrupts and forms an accretion disk .",
    "the magnetic field is then amplified in the accretion disk and transported onto the wd surface .",
    "mass - loss proceeds during the post - main - sequence - giant phases until the natal , magnetized wd is exposed .    in this proceeding",
    ", we highlight recent results from this scenario@xcite and show that for a range of disrupted - companion masses , the fields generated in the disk are sufficient to explain the observed range of hfmwds .",
    "additionally , we discuss the possible evolutionary relationships that hfmwds have with related objects such as post - agb stars@xcite and planetary nebulae ( pne)@xcite . finally , we comment on high - mass stellar analogues@xcite .",
    "disks can form inside common envelopes for a wide range of companions .",
    "jupiter - mass planets@xcite , brown dwarfs and low - mass stars will tidally disrupt inside an agb star when the self gravity of the companion is overcome by the differential gravitational force of the white dwarf core .",
    "this occurs at the tidal shredding radius , which we estimate as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radius and mass of the companion and @xmath8 is the stellar mass interior to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "note that planetary and low - mass stellar companions to solar - type stars are significantly more plentiful than brown dwarfs@xcite .",
    "therefore , disks in the lower and higher mass ranges may be more common than those in the intermediate mass range .    once the disk forms , it is ionized and thus , susceptible to the development of magnetized turbulence ( e.g.  via the magneto - rotational instability ) .",
    "accretion proceeds on a viscous timescale given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the keplerian orbital period at radius @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the effective kinematic viscosity , @xmath14 is the disk scaleheight , @xmath15 is the midplane soundspeed , @xmath16 is the keplerian orbital frequency , and @xmath17 is the dimensionsless shakura - sunyaev parameter that characterizes the efficiency of angular momentum transport .",
    "initially , the accretion rate can be approximated as @xmath18 where @xmath6 is scaled to the radius of jupiter and @xmath19 to a large value @xmath20 because the disk can not is geometrically thick and can not cool efficiently at high accretion rates .",
    "additionally , since the companions under consideration lead to disks much more dense than the stellar envelope , we ignore any interaction between the disk and the star .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mdot0 ] ) illustrates that for @xmath21 , and for typical values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is initially a few to many orders of magnitude larger than the eddington accretion rate of the proto - wd ( i.e. , @xmath24  yr@xmath25 ) . at first",
    ", it might seem apparent that inflow of mass onto the wd surface would be inhibited by radiation pressure .",
    "however , this neglects the fact that , at sufficiently high accretion rates , photons are trapped and advected to small radii faster than they can diffuse out @xcite . in this ` hyper - critical ' regime , accretion is possible when @xmath26 .",
    "hyper - critical accretion may occur if the accretion timescale , @xmath27 , is less than the timescale for photons to diffuse out of the disk midplane , @xmath28@xcite .",
    "the location in the disk where this occurs is called the `` trapping radius '' and is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the opacity .",
    "an important quantity is the ratio of the trapping radius to the outer disk radius @xmath9 ( coincident with the tidal shredding radius ) : @xmath31 where we have used equation ( [ eq : mdot0 ] ) and scaled @xmath30 to the electron scattering opacity @xmath32 @xmath33 g@xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 and photons are advected with the matter .    from equation ( [ eq : trap_ratio ] )",
    "we conclude that @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "this implies that photon pressure will be unable to halt accretion initially and that the local energy released by accretion must be removed by advection@xcite .",
    "advection acts like a conveyor belt , nominally carrying the gas to small radii as its angular momentum is removed .",
    "if there is no sink for the hot gas , this conveyor may  jam \" .",
    "this is an important distinction between white dwarfs and neutron stars or black holes , as the latter two can remove the thermal energy by neutrino cooling or advection through the event horizon , respectively . for wds ,",
    "neutrino cooling is ineffective and thermal pressure builds , such that radiation pressure may again become dynamically significant .",
    "however , this scenario neglects the possibility of outflows , which can sustain inflow by carrying away the majority of the thermal energy , thereby allowing a smaller fraction of the material to accrete at a higher than eddington rate . though more work is needed to assess the efficiency of outflows in the present context , radiatively - inefficient accretion flows are widely thought to be prone to powerful outflows@xcite .",
    "even if accretion occurs at , or near , the eddington rate , the fields produced ( @xmath38  mg ) are still strong enough to explain the bulk of the magnetized wd population .",
    "the origin of the strongest field systems ( @xmath0100 - 1000 mg ) may be problematic if accretion is limited to the eddington rate .",
    "nevertheless , the material deposited outside the wd will be hot and virialized , forming an extended envelope with a lengthscale comparable to the radius .",
    "though hot , this material will eventually cool on stellar timescales and become incorporated into the stellar layers near the proto - wd surface .",
    "if this material cools at some fraction of the local eddington luminosity , it will be incorporated onto the wd surface on a timescale @xmath0@xmath39 years  much less than typical agb lifetimes .",
    "due to the presence of shear in the disk , the mri is a likely source of turbulence , and can supply the conditions by which magnetic field amplification can occur .",
    "large - scale fields produced by the mri have been modeled via @xmath40 dynamos at various levels of sophistication . however , for the purposes of estimating orders of magnitude of the fields , approximate values from less sophisticated treatments can be employed as we do now .",
    "the alfvn velocity in the disk obeys @xmath41 , such that the mean toroidal field at radius @xmath12 is given by@xcite @xmath42 where in the second equality we have substituted equation ( [ eq : mdot0 ] ) for @xmath23 , and multiplied by the factor @xmath43 to account for the possibility of outflows as described above . if an @xmath40 dynamo operates , the mean poloidal field @xmath44 is related to the toroidal field via @xmath45@xcite . however , regardless of whether a large scale field is generated , a turbulent field of magnitude @xmath46 is likely to be present and contributing significantly to the maxwell stresses responsible for disk accretion .    the toroidal field evaluated near the wd surface @xmath47  cm as a function of companion mass @xmath7 , calculated for two different values of the viscosity ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) is shown in fig .",
    "2 . in both cases , we assume that @xmath50 . + _ note that for the range of relevant companion masses @xmath51 @xmath52 , @xmath53  mg , in precisely the correct range to explain the inferred surface field strengths of hfmwds ( see fig .",
    "2 below ) .",
    "if the origin of highly magnetized wds lie in common envelope phases , then they may also exist around proto - planetary ( ppne ) and planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "for these systems , the link between close binary interactions and the formation of ppne / pne has been well established@xcite .",
    "it s interesting to also note that the presence of outflows inside the agb star , near the proto - wd surface is already coincident with the prevalence of outflows in proto - planetary nebulae .",
    "the direct detection of a hfmwd in a ppn or pn system would provide additional evidence for the binary scenario .",
    "recent , indirect evidence in the form of hot x - ray emitting gas in two post - ce pn systems has been discovered and could be due to magnetic activity or accretion onto the wd@xcite .",
    "additionally , observations of masers in post - agb water fountain sources show magnetically - shaped , bipolar jet - like structures@xcite .",
    "while @xmath54% of wds are highly magnetized , it s interesting to note that @xmath54% of neutron stars are highly magnetized .",
    "high - mass stars may also undergo common envelope interactions in the presence of close companions .",
    "if the common envelope field mechanisms described in this proceeding and in our previous paper@xcite operate in high - mass stars , then the result could be strong field neutron stars or magnetars ( neutron stars with magnetic fields in excess of @xmath0@xmath55  g ) .",
    "in particular , formation of an accretion disk from an engulfed companion during a red supergiant phase could produce a magnetized wd core . in the eventual core - collapse and stellar supernova explosion ( possibly driven by the neutrino mechanism ;",
    "@xcite ) , the magnetized wd core collapses to a neutron star . if simple flux freezing operates ( itself an open question ) and the initial magnetized core is on the order of @xmath0100 - 1000  mg , homologous collapse to a neutron star would generate @xmath0@xmath55  g fields .",
    "typical neutron stars that possess modest field strengths may originate from core - collapse supernova of single stars or stars without having incurred a ce phase .",
    "note that what we are proposing is an alternative to the neutrino - driven convection dynamo@xcite . in our scenario ,",
    "the engulfment of a companion and the formation of an accretion disk naturally provides fast rotation , magnetized turbulence and differential rotation  the same ingredients that are also needed for the neutrino - driven convection dynamo .",
    "in summary , common envelope evolution as the origin of highly - magnetized , white dwarfs is strongly supported by observations . for hfmwds , whether the scenario described in this proceeding and our previous paper@xcite is ultimately found to be viable will depend on the statistics of low - mass stellar and substellar companions@xcite to stars of similar masses to ( or somewhat higher masses than ) the sun .",
    "the numerous radial velocity searches of the last 20 years have revealed a number of such companions though the precise occurrence rate of companions in orbits that could lead to the kind of disk - dynamo mechanism remains unclear . further theoretical work into the binary origin of hfmwds and magnetars",
    "requires the development of multi - dimensional , magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ce phase .",
