    "the discovery and ongoing development of gauge / string dualities @xcite has opened up a new and exciting frontier for nonperturbative qcd .",
    "already the current , first generation of `` holographic qcd '' or `` ads / qcd '' duals with their bold approximations is beginning to provide new and often surprising analytical insights into the elusive infrared ( ir ) sector of the strong interactions .    by now a rather large set of static hadron properties has been calculated in the ads / qcd framework ( for recent reviews see e.g. ref . [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the majority of this work was based on the two currently most popular dual candidates , i.e. the hard- @xcite and soft - wall @xcite backgrounds .",
    "since even these rather minimal gravity backgrounds turn out to describe most calculated static hadron properties at an astonishing 10 - 30% accuracy level , it becomes increasingly important to explore their capacity and limitations in describing more detailed and sensitive qcd amplitudes .",
    "one such class of amplitudes comprises the hadron form - factors , and several of them have already been estimated holographically @xcite .",
    "another important set of hadron amplitudes are the @xmath0-point functions of hadronic interpolating fields , and among these the two - point correlators play a special role , not least because detailed qcd results are available for most of them .",
    "we have therefore recently advocated @xcite to put ads / qcd dual candidates to more stringent tests by evaluating their predictions for hadron correlators and by confronting those with qcd information from the lattice @xcite , the operator product expansion ( ope ) including hard instanton contributions to the wilson coefficients @xcite , a hypothetical uv gluon mass suggested to encode the short - distance behavior of the static quark - antiquark potential @xcite , and a scaling low - energy theorem @xcite based on the trace anomaly .",
    "( ads / qcd correlators were recently also studied in refs .",
    "[ 1113 ] . )",
    "in the following we will outline the main steps of implementing this program in the scalar glueball channel @xcite . to this end , we review the calculation of the scalar glueball spectra , decay constants and correlators in both hard- and soft - wall backgrounds , and we comment on a recent attempt @xcite to generalize the soft - wall correlator .",
    "the holographic hard- and dilaton soft - wall duals are both based on five - dimensional bulk geometries of `` poincar domain wall '' type@xmath1where @xmath2 is the four - dimensional minkowski metric and conformal invariance of the dual gauge theory in the uv requires @xmath3 .",
    "the soft wall additionally contains a bulk dilaton field @xmath4 .",
    "scalar qcd glueballs are interpolated by the lowest - dimensional gluonic operator carrying vacuum quantum numbers , @xmath5(where @xmath6 is the gluon field strength ) . since @xmath7 has conformal dimension @xmath8 ( at the classical level ) , the ads / cft dictionary @xcite prescribes its dual string modes @xmath9 to be the normalizable solutions of the scalar wave equation in the bulk geometry ( [ metric ] ) ( and possibly other background fields ) with the uv behavior @xmath10 .",
    "the latter implies that the square mass @xmath11 of the bulk field @xmath12 vanishes for @xmath13 , so that its minimal action takes the form@xmath14 = \\frac{1}{2\\kappa ^{2}}\\int d^{5}x\\sqrt{% \\left| g\\right| } e^{-\\phi } g^{mn}\\partial _ { m}\\varphi \\partial _ { n}\\varphi . \\label{sd}\\ ] ]    the four - dimensional fourier transform @xmath15 of the normalizable dual modes solves the reduced field equation@xmath16 \\hat{\\varphi}\\left ( q , z\\right ) = 0   \\label{fe}\\]]obtained by variation of the bulk action ( [ sd ] ) .",
    "the corresponding orthonormalized solutions @xmath17 have discrete momenta @xmath18 which determine the glueball mass spectrum of the boundary gauge theory .    for dilaton fields which vanish at the uv boundary ( as in the soft wall case ) , the glueball correlator has the spectral representation @xmath19where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath20 and regularizing contact terms for @xmath21 are not written explicitly .",
    "the pole residues of eq .",
    "( [ specrep ] ) contain the decay constants @xmath22of the @xmath0-th @xmath23 glueball excitation .",
    "since the @xmath24 can be regarded as the glueball ( bethe - salpeter ) wave functions at the origin , a smaller glueball size implies a higher concentration of the wave function and consequently a larger value of @xmath24 .",
    "evidence for such an enhancement of the ground - state decay constant was found in instanton vacuum models sch95 , in qcd sum rule analyses which include instanton contributions to the ope coefficients @xcite , and in ( quenched ) lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "the hard - wall geometry of polchinski and strassler @xcite is an ads@xmath25 slice with a randall - sundrum type cutoff @xmath26 at the ir brane , @xmath27which implements conformal symmetry in the uv and its breaking in the ir in a minimal fashion .",
    "the glueball decay constants in the hard - wall background can be calculated directly from the normalized solutions@xmath28(where @xmath29 ) of the field equation ( [ fe ] ) in the metric ( [ hw ] ) .",
    "the constants @xmath30 are determined by the normalization condition @xmath31 . for the dirichlet",

    "either way , the ground - state decay constant predictions remain in the range @xmath44 gev @xcite .      the hard - wall predictions ( [ mnd ] ) , ( [ mnn ] ) for the squared masses of scalar glueballs ( and of other hadrons )  grow quadratically with high radial ( and orbital ) excitation quantum numbers , in contrast to the linear trajectories expected from semiclassical models and data .",

    "it implies @xmath93 fm , i.e. almost twice the standard  value @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that the bulk dynamics ( [ sd ] ) is more suitable for pure yang - mills theory with it larger instanton sizes @xmath94 fm , and that the strongly coupled hard - wall uv dynamics describes the small - instanton physics beyond the conformal regime rather poorly .",
    "the above discussion implies that @xmath95 , i.e. that large instantons , which would contribute to the condensates , are absent since their duals do not fit into the ads@xmath96 slice .",
    "hence the hard wall reproduces the qcd result that the _ hard _ nonperturbative physics from small instantons ( instead of the soft condensate physics ) dominates the short - distance @xmath23 glueball correlator @xcite .",
    "moreover , the qcd low - energy theorem @xcite @xmath97with @xmath98 is trivially satisfied by the hard - wall correlator ( [ hwc ] ) which vanishes at @xmath99 .",

    "( [ est ] ) since large momenta @xmath109 probe the @xmath110 region where hard- and soft - wall correlators are governed by the same ads@xmath96-induced logarithm .",
    "besides the leading conformal and a second logarithmic term , the expansion ( [ c ] ) contains an infinite tower of power corrections .",
    "comparison with the ope suggests those to be related to the gauge - theory condensates @xmath111 of @xmath112 dimensional composite operators . for a first order - of - magnitude check one may equate the coefficients of the @xmath113 and @xmath114 terms in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) to the ( @xmath115 ) qcd wilson coefficients , yielding@xmath116for @xmath117 these are the rough magnitudes of the qcd condensates , but the sign of the qcd gluon condensate @xmath118 gev@xmath119 is positive . while qcd estimates of both signs exist for the three - gluon condensate , the above signs would also be at odds with the factorization approximation @xmath120 .",
    "the probably most intriguing prediction of the soft - wall correlator ( [ c ] ) is the additional power correction of dimension two which can not appear in the ope since qcd lacks a corresponding local operator .",
    "when linear contributions to the _ short_-distance heavy - quark potential are approximately described by a tachyonic gluon mass @xmath121 , however , one finds the correction @xcite@xmath122which has precisely the form of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) .",
    "comparison of the coefficients provides the holographic estimate @xmath123 and with @xmath124 further @xmath125 gev@xmath126 which is of the expected magnitude @xcite but again of opposite sign , i.e. not tachyonic .",
    "hence the expansion ( [ c ] ) completely reproduces the qualitative @xmath82 dependence of the qcd short - distance correlator ( to leading order in @xmath127 ) but fails to predict the sign of at least the two leading terms .",
    "this pattern can be better understood by recalling that the dimensions of the qcd condensates are generated by operators which are renormalized at @xmath128 gev and thus ir  dominated . the form and general @xmath82 dependence of the qcd power corrections",
    "is therefore governed by ir physics , which may explain why the strongly - coupled soft - wall dynamics can reproduce it .",
    "the deviations of size and signs of the holographic power corrections from their qcd counterparts ( and the absence of radiative corrections ) should then originate mainly from the poorer description of the weakly - coupled , perturbative wilson coefficients by the soft - wall dynamics which lacks @xmath129 corrections and remains strongly coupled in the uv .",
    "the above interpretation also suggests an approximate separation of the soft - wall power corrections into wilson coefficients and condensates . indeed , under the premise that the strongly - coupled soft wall dynamics approximately reproduces the qcd  condensate values , one may obtain holographic estimates for the wilson coefficients",
    "the gluon condensate coefficient , e.g. , becomes with @xmath130 @xcite and @xmath131 @xcite @xmath132its smaller size and opposite sign relative to the qcd result provides some intuition for the soft - wall deficiencies in describing weakly - coupled qcd physics .",
    "of course , the estimate ( [ cg2 ] ) is prone to further error sources , including uncertainties in the qcd condensate values and their sensitivity to light quark contributions .",
    "( the above separation into hard and soft contributions would fail for the two - dimensional power correction , incidentally , since both the gluon mass @xmath121 and its coefficient receive uv contributions . ) since the condensates are hadron - channel independent while the wilson coefficients are not , one would further expect to obtain inconsistent condensate estimates when trying to extract them in different channels by relying on the respective qcd wilson coefficients . finally , we note that the soft - wall correlator ( [ swc ] ) with @xmath133 violates the low - energy theorem ( [ let ] ) since eq .",
    "( [ g4 ] ) implies a finite rhs .",
    "recently an attempt has been made to generalize the soft - wall glueball correlator ( [ swc ] ) by adding to the bulk - to - boundary propagator @xmath134 the at small @xmath20 subleading solution of eq .",
    "( [ fe ] ) , multiplied by an a priori arbitrary coefficient function @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "the added solution blows up at large @xmath20 , i.e. it violates the standard `` regularity in the bulk '' condition @xcite and requires an ad - hoc ir cutoff prescription without obvious correspondence on the gauge - theory side ( in contrast to the standard uv renormalization whose `` dual '' tames the volume divergence of the on - shell bulk action ) . the resulting expression for",
    "the correlator differs from ours , i.e. eq . ( swc ) , by the addition of the arbitrary coefficient function @xmath136 .",
    "any desired behavior of the correlator could thus be chosen by hand , and independently of the soft - wall background , by adapting @xmath137 accordingly .",
    "[ 12 ] attempted to use this apparent freedom to equate the @xmath138 power corrections to their qcdvalues and to eliminate the two - dimensional power correction . )",
    "hence the prescription of ref .",
    "[ 12 ] gives up on the one - to - one duality between the gauge vacuum and the gravity background ( together with other parts of the ads / cft dictionary ) and results in a practically total loss of predictive power .",
    "moreover , it is internally inconsistent .",
    "indeed , it was shown to result in the same mass spectrum ( [ msw ] ) and the same decay constants ( [ fsw ] ) as in our case @xcite .",
    "hence it must reproduce our spectral density ( [ swsd ] ) and thus the physics content of the correlator ( [ swc ] ) , i.e. any remaining discrepancies have to originate from the unphysical contact terms which are needed to regularize the dispersion integral ( [ drel ] ) .",
    "this is in direct contradiction to the supposed freedom of adding an arbitrary function @xmath135 to the correlator .",
    "the loss of predictivity , uniqueness and consistency incurred when relaxing the regularity of @xmath68 in the bulk has a common origin .",
    "indeed , any given ( smooth ) function defined on the uv boundary @xmath139 of ( euclidean and compactified ) ads@xmath140 is known to have a _",
    "unique _ extension to a solution of the massless scalar field equation in the ads@xmath140 bulk @xcite . when applied to the boundary source @xmath141",
    ", this mathematical fact ensures the one - to - one correspondence between the gauge - theory operators and the dual string mode solutions .",
    "the inconsistency of the attempted generalization of the bulk - to - boundary propagator arises from the violation of this fact . in order to maintain the mathematically required uniqueness of the relation ( [ sln ] ) between a given boundary source @xmath142 and its dual mode solution @xmath143",
    ", the uv - subleading solution must not be added to @xmath68 .",
    "we have derived and analyzed the predictions of the two currently most popular ads / qcd duals , i.e. the hard - wall and dilaton soft - wall backgrounds , for the @xmath23 glueball correlation function and decay constants .    in their representation of specific nonperturbative glueball physics ( at momenta larger than the qcd scale )",
    "both holographic duals turn out to complement each other : the soft - wall correlator contains all known types of qcd power corrections , generated both by vacuum condensates and by a hypothetical uv gluon mass , while sizeable exponential corrections of the type induced by small - scale qcd instantons are reproduced in the hard - wall correlator .",
    "since the qcd power corrections to the @xmath23 glueball correlator are suppressed by unusually small wilson coefficients whereas the small - instanton contributions are enhanced , the hard - wall background may provide a more reliable approximation to the scalar glueball correlator . furthermore , the above complementarity , which helps to relate holographic predictions ( and their limitations ) to specific aspects of the gauge dynamics , should extend to other hadron channels .    while all our holographic estimates have the order of magnitude expected from qcd@xmath144 the signs of the two leading soft - wall power corrections are opposite to those of standard qcd estimates ( and in conflict with the factorization approximation for the four - gluon condensate ) .",
    "we have argued that this provides evidence for the short - distance physics in the wilson coefficients to be inadequately reproduced by the strongly - coupled uv dynamics of bottom - up models ( beyond the leading conformal logarithm ) .",
    "we have further shown that this problem can not be mended by admixing the uv - subleading solution to the bulk - to - boundary propagator ( as recently advocated )  without loosing consistency and predictive power .",
    "in addition , we have provided first holographic estimates for the @xmath23 glueball decay constants which contain glueball size information , are important for experimental glueball searches and probe aspects of the dual dynamics to which the mass spectrum is less sensitive . the hard - wall prediction for the ground - state decay",
    "constant @xmath145 is more than twice as large as its soft - wall counterpart .",
    "this is a consequence of the exponential contributions to the hard - wall correlator which reproduce the strong instanton - induced short - distance attraction in the qcd correlator .",
    "the hard - wall prediction @xmath146 gev implies an exceptionally small glueball size and agrees inside errors with iope sum - rule and lattice results .",
