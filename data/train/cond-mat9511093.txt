[ krho1/2:fig ] : the exponent @xmath63 at @xmath62 scales to a value somewhat larger than the critical value 1 , which is also the value of @xmath63 for the non - interacting hubbard model .",

    "the most remarkable feature is in the low density region @xmath221 , where superconducting correlations are found to be dominant up to positive values of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 comparable to the electronic bandwidth .",
    "we believe that the physics at small densities is robust .",
    "the bound states discussed in section [ low_dens : sect ] should lead to bose condensation of strongly localizes cooper pairs in @xmath222 .",
    "in @xmath223 no bound state is found but a superconducting instability should still occur in the presence of a fermi surface . on the other hand , other features of the model , like the presence of a spin gap over all the phase diagram  including the positive @xmath2 metallic regime ",
    "are probably confined to the low dimensionality @xmath0 case .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 phase diagram of a model of electrons which hop weakly between molecular sites . due to the berry phase mechanism",
    ", each molecular site possesses an unquenched orbital degeneracy , only when its electron occupancy is odd . upon electron",
    "hopping , the orbital degeneracies must correspondingly switch , as the occupancies of the initial and final states change . by adding adjustable on - site hubbard @xmath2 term",
    ", we can effectively remove from the problem all polaronic effects , and we can thus study the effect of orbital degeneracy , and of its hopping - induced switch , in isolation . the working model ( [ model : eqn ] ) is therefore hubbard - like , but embodies the orbital degeneracy part in the form of a pseudospin-1 on - site variable .",
    "we have studied its zero - temperature phase diagram as a function of electron filling and of hubbard @xmath2 .    through a series of mappings  all of which are exact for what concerns the asymptotic behavior of correlations in @xmath0  we find that the problem is equivalent to a particular variant of two coupled @xmath0 chains , whose behavior is generally well studied@xcite .",
    "this mapping predicts that there will generally be no charge gap ( except at half filling for @xmath13 ) while there will always be a spin gap , for all @xmath224 and all @xmath2 .",
    "the zero charge gap is related to either sliding cdw conductivity or superconductivity , and we have distinguished these two different regions in the phase diagram .",
    "a quantitative study of the phase diagram , conducted by exact diagonalization and finite size scaling , has led to the overall picture of fig . [",
    "diagram : fig ] .",
    "the most interesting fact in the phase diagram is the dominance of superconductive behavior extending even into the ( moderately ) repulsive-@xmath2 region .",
    "pairing is associated with new orbital correlations  as foreshadowed by an exact 2-electron solution  which permit a lowering of kinetic energy through an enhanced nearest neighbor pair scattering .",
    "this feature represents an important novelty brought about by orbital degeneracy , and should reasonably carry over to more complex and realistic situations in higher dimensions .",
    "this pairing mechanism is not easily destroyed by a repulsive @xmath2 , it is more effective at low carrier density , and is apparently immune from the polaron self - trapping , which depresses @xmath225 in strongly coupled electron - phonon systems .    another new feature found in this model in @xmath0 is the presence of an overall spin gap , including the nonsuperconductive region of the phase diagram , where sliding cdw @xmath12 correlations dominate .",
    "it is at this stage not clear in what way this behavior ( which appears rather specific of 1d ) will change in higher dimensions .",
    "the notation adopted here differs from that of ref .",
