    "the evolution of white dwarfs is essentially a cooling process that lasts for @xmath0 gyr . since the study of white dwarfs allows to obtain information about the age of the galaxy ( winget et al .",
    "1987 , garca - berro et al .",
    "1988a , b , hernanz et al .",
    "1994 ) , it is important to identify all the sources of energy as well as the mechanisms that control its outflow .    the vast majority of white dwarfs ( those with masses in the range @xmath1 ) are made of a mixture of carbon , oxygen and some impurities coming from the metal content of the parent star .",
    "the most important of these impurities is @xmath2ne , which results from he - burning on the ashes of the cno cycle , and reaches @xmath3 2% by mass in population i stars . since during the cooling process the star experiences a phase transition , it is natural to wonder if a change of solubility at the onset of crystallization can provide an extra source of energy ( schatzman 1958 , stevenson 1980 , mochkovitch 1983 ) .",
    "segretain and chabrier ( 1993 ) and segretain et al . (",
    "1994 ) computed phase diagrams for arbitrary binary mixtures in terms of the modern density - functional theory of freezing .",
    "they showed that the shape of the phase diagram was completely characterized by the charge ratio of the mixture , @xmath4 .",
    "their diagrams evolve from the spindle form for @xmath5 , into an azeotropic form for @xmath6 and finally into an eutectic form for @xmath7 . using these phase diagrams , hernanz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) showed that the chemical differentiation of pure carbon - oxygen mixtures could introduce a delay of up to @xmath8 gyr , depending on the adopted initial profiles of carbon and oxygen in the white dwarf before freezing .",
    "the settling of @xmath2ne was much more spectacular since it could keep the white dwarf warm during several billion years , if the abundance of neon was assumed to be @xmath9 ( isern et al .",
    "1991 , segretain et al .",
    "the deposition of @xmath10fe , the second impurity in importance , turned out to be less important ( xu and van horn 1992 , segretain et al .",
    "1994 ) because of its smaller abundance , @xmath11 . in any case , and contrary to the carbon - oxygen case , these impurities should not affect the determination of the disk age from white dwarfs since their abundances are expected to be negligible in the oldest objects ( hernanz et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "although the importance of the mechanical and thermodynamical consequences of the solidification of alloys has been recognized in geophysics ( loper 1978 , chen 1995 ) , this is not the case in astrophysics and very often these phenomena are either completely ignored or sometimes , misinterpreted . in this paper",
    "we reexamine the efficiency of convective mixing , which is responsible for the redistribution of the chemical elements during crystallization , and we provide a suitable formalism to compute the subsequent energy released during this process .",
    "due to the spindle shape of the phase diagram of c / o mixtures , the solid formed upon crystallization is richer in oxygen than the liquid and therefore denser . using the condition of pressure continuity",
    ", the density excess can be estimated to be : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the ionic and electronic pressures respectively , @xmath15 is the electron adiabatic index and @xmath16 is the number of electrons per nucleon . for a @xmath17 white dwarf with equal amounts of carbon and oxygen , @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , as the solid core grows from the center of the star the lighter liquid left behind can be redistributed by rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( stevenson , 1980 ; mochkovitch 1983 ) .",
    "the local energy budget of the white dwarf can be written as : @xmath19 where all the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "assume now that the white dwarf is made of two chemical species with atomic numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 , mass numbers @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and abundances by mass @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively @xmath26 .",
    "in the following , the suffix 0 will always refer to the heavier component . using the first principle of thermodynamics",
    ", the right hand side of equation ( 2 ) can be written as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the internal energy per unit mass and @xmath29 .",
    "we can also write @xmath30 using the elementary thermodynamic relation @xmath31 equation ( 2 ) can now be written as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the latent heat of crystallization and @xmath34 is the rate at which the solid core grows ; the delta function indicates that the latent heat is released at the solidification front .",
    "notice that chemical differentiation contributes to the luminosity not only through compressional work , which is negligible , but also through the change in the chemical abundances , which leads to the last term of this equation .",
    "notice , as well , that the largest contribution to @xmath35 due to the change in @xmath28 exactly cancels out the @xmath36 work for _ any _ evolutionary change ( with or without a compositional change ) .",
    "this is , of course , a well known result ( mestel 1952 , kovetz and shaviv 1975 , lamb and van horn 1975 , dantona and mazzitelli 1990 ) that can be related to the release of gravitational energy ( see below ) .    finally , integrating ( 6 ) over the whole star ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath37    the first term of equation ( 7 ) is the well known contribution of the heat capacity of the star to the total luminosity ( mestel 1952 ) .",
    "the second term represents the contribution to the luminosity due to the change of volume .",
    "it is in general small since only the thermal part of the electronic pressure , the ideal part of the ions and the coulomb terms other than the madelung term contribute ( kovetz and shaviv 1975 , lamb and van horn 1975 ) .",
    "however , when the white dwarf enters into the debye regime , this term provides about the 80% of the total luminosity preventing the sudden disappearence of the star ( dantona and mazzitelli 1990 ) .",
    "the third term represents the contribution of the latent heat to the total luminosity at freezing .",
    "since the latent heat of coulomb plasmas is small ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the solidification temperature ) , its contribution to the total luminosity is modest although not negligible .",
    "the fourth term represents the energy released by the chemical readjustement of the white dwarf , i.e. the release of the energy stored in the form of chemical potentials .",
    "this term is usually negligible in normal stars , since it is much smaller than the energy released by nuclear reactions , but it must be taken into account when all other energy sources are small .    the last term in equation ( 7 ) can be further expanded .",
    "consider that the crystallization front is at mass coordinate @xmath40 , that in a time interval @xmath41 the crystallization front advances by @xmath42 , and that the extension of the convective shell driven by the rayleigh - taylor instability is @xmath43 . then the change in the chemical abundance of the mixing region @xmath44 can be related ( assuming perfect mixing , see  3 below ) to the difference between the chemical abundances of the liquid and the solid : @xmath45 besides , we can write @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the partial derivative evaluated at the edge of the solid core . taking into account equation ( 8) , we can now write @xmath48\\frac{dm_{\\rm s}}{dt}\\ ] ] where @xmath49    from equation ( 10 ) we can define the total energy released per gram of crystallized matter due to the change in chemical composition as : @xmath50\\ ] ] the square bracket is negative since @xmath51 is negative and essentially depends on the density , which monotonically decreases outwards . the internal energy per unit mass can be divided into the electronic and the ionic components , so we can write @xmath52 . for the sake of simplicity we are only going to use here",
    "the completely degenerate nonrelativistic expression for the electrons @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( cgs units ) , and the ideal contribution plus the madelung term of the coulomb energy for the ions @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the gas constant and @xmath57 is the coulomb coupling constant , with @xmath58 .",
    "since the contribution to the electron mole number of carbon and oxygen are very similar @xmath59 is dominated by the ionic contribution ( see  4 below ) . thus , we can obtain a more transparent expression for @xmath59 showing that it also corresponds to a release of gravitational energy .",
    "we first write @xmath60 where we have introduced the parameter @xmath61 the ionic pressure associated to the madelung energy is @xmath62 so that @xmath63 @xmath64 being the change of ionic pressure at crystallization .",
    "the last term in the above equation has been obtained by taking into account pressure continuity , which leads to @xmath65 .",
    "finally , using the virial theorem in the form @xmath66 where the average is taken over the white dwarf mass and where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are , respectively , the white dwarf gravitational energy , surface gravity and radius ( @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) , we obtain @xmath72 the factor k is of the order of unity except close to the surface of the white dwarf where @xmath73 rapidly decreases . with this expression for @xmath59",
    ", it is clearly seen that it corresponds to a release of gravitational energy .",
    "before computing the energy released by chemical segregation it is convenient to check the efficiency of convective mixing . let @xmath74 be the propagation velocity of the solidification front into the c / o mixture .",
    "this velocity , which can be obtained from the models , is very small , @xmath75 cm / yr . the mass flux of carbon released by the front in the liquid phase is : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the carbon mass fractions in the liquid and the solid respectively .",
    "the criterion for convective instability taking into account heat conduction from the convective eddies is ( stevenson and salpeter 1977 ) : @xmath79 with @xmath80 @xmath81\\ ] ] @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the pressure scale height , @xmath84 is the sound velocity , @xmath85 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the conductive and the convective characteristic times , respectively . if @xmath89 is the mixing length , the convective velocity can be written as @xmath90 and the characteristic times are given by : @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the thermal conductivity . if the carbon mass flux released at the crystallization front is to be efficiently carried by convection we have @xmath94 together with a small superadiabaticity @xmath95 if the superadiabaticity is indeed small ( which will have to be checked on the final results ) , the gradient of carbon mass fraction in the white dwarf is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 the value of q has been computed for a 0.6 @xmath98 crystallizing c / o white dwarf and is typically a few @xmath99 .",
    "now it is possible to obtain the peclet number , @xmath100 , as @xmath101 where @xmath102 @xmath103s@xmath104 is a typical value of the conductivity in the white dwarf .",
    "then @xmath105 and the gradient of carbon mass fraction @xmath106 is so small that @xmath107 varies by less than 1% in the convective region .",
    "we now check that the small superadiabaticity hypothesis is correct , i.e. : @xmath108 we first compute @xmath109 with the simplified equation of state described in  2 . for a crystallizing c / o white dwarf",
    "we get    @xmath110    an upper limit of the superadiabacity can be obtained by assuming that , due to the interaction of convection with rotation , the rossby number @xmath111 is equal to unity , where @xmath112 is the angular velocity of the white dwarf ( stevenson and salpeter 1976 ) .",
    "then , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the rotation period .",
    "we therefore conclude that , even when rotation is considered , convection is indeed an efficient mechanism to redistribute the carbon rich fluid out from the crystallization front and that the liquid phase can be considered well mixed .",
    "figure 1 displays the evolution of the energy released per unit mass crystallized as the solidification proceeds . for the sake of simplicity we have assumed in these calculations that the white dwarf is made of an homogeneous 50:50 ( by mass ) mixture of carbon and oxygen .",
    "the energy released near the center of the white dwarf is @xmath115 erg / g and the partial contribution of electrons and ions are , respectively @xmath116 erg / g and @xmath117 erg / g .",
    "the electron term is negative and different from zero only due to the mass defect of oxygen ( @xmath118 ) relative to carbon .",
    "if we had considered other species with a higher number of neutrons as compared with protons , as is the case of @xmath2ne or @xmath10fe , the situation would have been the reverse .",
    "the total energy released during this process is @xmath119 erg .    since , to a good approximation",
    ", the luminosity of a white dwarf can be considered to be a function of the temperature of its nearly isothermal core , @xmath120 , it is possible to estimate the delay introduced by the solidification as : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the core temperature when the crystallization front is located at @xmath123 .",
    "the extra time to reach a luminosity @xmath124 is 1.81 gyr . to compute it",
    "we have used the same relationship between the luminosity and the core temperature as in segretain et al .",
    "of course , the total delay essentially depends on the transparency of the envelope .",
    "any change in one sense or another can amplify or damp the influence of solidification in the cooling of white dwarfs and for the moment there are not completely reliable envelope models at low luminosities ( mazzitelli 1994 ) .",
    "we have provided a new formulation of the thermodynamics of phase separation upon crystallization that proves that chemical differentiation results in a net release of heat that is radiated away thus delaying the cooling of the star .",
    "this extra heating is not due to compressional work , but to the local changes of chemical abundances .",
    "this formulation is very simple and is suitable for introduction in evolutionary codes .",
    "we have also shown that the hypothesis of perfect rehomogeneization of the liquid is reasonable and can be used to simplify the problem .",
    "notice that if this was not the case , this would result in a decrease of the efficiency of the redistribution process as an energy source but would not invalidate the result that if there is some redistribution there is a release of heat .",
    "finally , we want to emphasize that the total delay introduced by this extra source of energy depends on the phase diagrams , on the initial chemical compositions and on the transparency of the outer envelope .",
    "any change in these factors can produce noticeable changes in the final outcome .",
