    "<S> the development of a new era of quantum devices requires an understanding of how paramagnetic dopants or impurity spins behave in crystal hosts . here , we describe a new spectroscopic technique which uses traditional electron spin resonance ( esr ) combined with the measurement of a large population of electromagnetic whispering gallery ( wg ) modes . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the characterization of the physical parameters of paramagnetic impurity ions in the crystal at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we present measurements of two ultra - high purity sapphires cooled to 20 mk in temperature , and determine the concentration of fe@xmath0 ions and their frequency sensitivity to a dc magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> our method is different to esr in that it is possible to track the resonant frequency of the ion from zero applied magnetic field to any arbitrary value , allowing excellent measurement precision . </S>",
    "<S> this high precision reveals anisotropic behaviour of the zeeman splitting , which has not been previously reported . in both crystals , </S>",
    "<S> each zeeman component demonstrates a different @xmath1-factor .    since the development of the first whispering gallery maser oscillator based on fe@xmath0 ions in sapphire </S>",
    "<S> , the system has been the focus of research at several institutions.@xcite however , the physical parameters of these paramagnetic ions in sapphire have never been characterised with sufficient accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> several experiments have attempted to measure the spin - spin relaxation time , or the number of ions involved in the maser process , but have given results which contradict the values given by the manufacturer of the crystals , or those found in the literature.@xcite this difference is essentially due to the method used to interact with the ions in sapphire , namely the excitation of high-@xmath2 whispering gallery modes at frequencies coincident with the esr frequency of the ion . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial distribution of these modes acts as filter , selecting only the population of ions which fall inside its field pattern . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the inhomogeneous broadening of the ion s esr bandwidth makes the characterization of their physical parameters difficult . until now </S>",
    "<S> , values in the literature have not been confirmed by another method.@xcite the present work describes a new technique for measuring these parameters , which in principle is valid at any temperature . in our work , crystals are cooled to near 20 mk in a dilution refrigerator , and all wg modes within a few ghz of the esr frequency of fe@xmath0 in sapphire ( 12.04 ghz ) are identified . </S>",
    "<S> then , a magnetic field is applied parallel to the cylindrical @xmath3-axis of the crystal , and swept in value . at each value of magnetic field , the reflection and transmission coefficients of the wg mode population are measured . </S>",
    "<S> characterisation of the frequency and quality factor of the modes allows the esr bandwidth and the concentration of the ions to be determined accurately enough to confirm the work published previously . </S>",
    "<S> this step is very important for such a system , because it is an excellent candidate for use in a host of quantum devices , with sapphire typically containing many species of residual paramagnetic spins compared to the current engineered quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> due to the inhomogeneous broadening effect , different spin packets are dispersed to different frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that these may act independently , with a coupling between the spin packets governed by the hyperfine interaction with the aluminium in sapphire lattice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these ` self ' interactions have also been observed exhibit non - linear behaviour . combining this with the high @xmath2-factors of the wg modes </S>",
    "<S> , sapphire is an attractive material for future quantum devices.@xcite it is therefore important to fully characterize the physical parameters of any ion defect centers in the crystals . </S>"
