    "in recent years , a new class of artificially engineered materials , so  called metamaterials @xcite , has attracted considerable attention , particularly because of their potential for super - resolution imaging @xcite . following different engineering approaches ,",
    "researchers have demonstrated metamaterials - based superlenses that have resolutions well below abbe s diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "for the various superlenses , the resolution has been experimentally estimated by imaging two subwavelength slits at a distance _ d _ apart ( where @xmath3 : wavelength ) .",
    "successful recovery of the image of the slit objects with the smallest possible gap _",
    "@xmath1 _ indicates the resolution @xmath0 of the lens ( i.e. @xmath2 ) .",
    "the drawback of this method is that it is time - consuming to determine",
    "_ @xmath4 _ exactly , and trial and error may be required . by using a trial and error technique ,",
    "it is easy to miss _ @xmath1 _ , which can be exemplified from cases in the literature ( discussed later in this letter ) .    in this letter",
    ", we present an analytical method to obtain a more quantitative estimate of the resolution of a superlens by analyzing the near - field imaging data of a two - slit void object , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bdfc_fig1](a ) .",
    "the idea is to numerically compute the near - field distribution of a two - slit object in the vicinity of a theoretical flat lens ( with known resolution ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ bdfc_fig1](b ) , and vary the resolution of the theoretical lens , in small increments , to obtain a near - field profile which is as close as possible to the one experimentally obtained from near - field scanning optical microscope ( nsom ) data .",
    "the advantage of our method is that it is possible to obtain a more accurate value for the resolution of the lens and that it is no longer necessary to find _",
    "@xmath4 _ experimentally by trial and error .",
    "the method yields the correct resolution of the fabricated prototype even with data obtained with a slit gap _",
    "@xmath5_. we demonstrate that the method is robust by tackling 3 case examples of superlensing from the literature and accordingly extracting the resolution of the superresolution lenses from transmitted near - field data .",
    "to understand the methodology , we review pendry s theoretical `` perfect '' lens concept @xcite .",
    "pendry s perfect lens with @xmath6 has infinite spatial resolution and will transmit all the @xmath7 components .",
    "an imperfect lens will only transmit a finite set of @xmath7 components , i.e.@xmath8 .",
    "the resolution @xmath9 of such an imperfect lens is then given by @xcite @xmath10 for tm polarization , the magnetic field of a two - slit object @xmath11 can be written as @xcite : @xmath12 with the coefficient @xmath13 given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; @xmath16 .    here ,",
    "2__b _ _ is the distance between the two slits and 2__a _ _ is the width of the individual slit , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bdfc_fig1](a ) .",
    "the waves will propagate freely in the vacuum for @xmath17 . since @xmath18 _ _ is purely imaginary for evanescent waves with @xmath19 , the near - field part of @xmath20 of the two - slit object is real .    from eq .",
    ", the transmitted near - field of the two - slit object @xmath21 from a flat lens of resolution @xmath0 reads @xmath22    here , @xmath23 is the transmission coefficient",
    ". the imaging performance or resolution of the metamaterials nanolens can be deduced by fitting the transmitted intensity profile curves from the theoretical flat lens , with different values of @xmath0 , to the experimental near - field scanning optical microscope intensity profile .",
    "the best fit will represent the actual resolution of the lens .",
    "the analytical equations discussed in this letter were computed using matlab @xcite .    as a first case example , we consider the three - dimensional ( 3d ) metamaterials nanolens by casse _",
    "et al . _ in ref @xcite .",
    "the two - slit object in this case is composed of two 600 nm slits spaced 400 nm ( 0.26@xmath24 ) and imaged at @xmath25=1550 nm .",
    "the intensity profile of the source object resembles two square - shape pulses , indicating an ideal profile ( with a very large resolution ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the diffraction - limited profile has a gaussian - like shape , where the gap can not be distinguished . as for the intensity profile of the image",
    ", it has the shape of the letter ` m ' . for the 3d metamaterials nanolens , the intensity profile curve obtained with a theoretical flat lens with @xmath26 resolution fitted very well the experimental data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bdfc_fig2](a ) . a corresponding analytical intensity plot of the two - slit image at the exit of the theoretical lens is shown in fig .  [ bdfc_fig2](b ) .",
    "experimentally , the resolution was found to be _",
    "@xmath27_. for this particular case , the authors determined @xmath1 accurately .",
    "_ it is important to note that fitting the two peaks is not as critical as fitting the middle part of the curve_.    the next example that we consider is the far - field optical superlens by z. liu _ et al . _ in ref @xcite . in this case , the object imaged is a nanowire pair with 50 nm wide slits , having a 70 nm gap , at @xmath25=377 nm , indicating a resolution of @xmath28 . the theoretical curve which fitted the experimental data is the theoretical lens that has a resolution of @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bdfc_fig3](a ) . a corresponding analytical intensity plot of the two - slit image at the exit of the theoretical lens is shown in fig .",
    "[ bdfc_fig3](b ) . the curve for a hypothetical lens with @xmath30",
    "is also shown for comparison .",
    "our method showed that @xmath1 has not been reached in this case , indicating that @xmath31 60 nm instead of 70 nm .",
    "the final example that we discuss is the far - field optical hyperlens by z. liu _ et al .",
    "_ in ref @xcite .",
    "the object imaged at @xmath25=365 nm was a 150-nm - spaced line pair object with slits of 35 nm width .",
    "the experimental prediction of resolution is @xmath32 . in this case",
    ", the curve which fitted the experimental data is the one with the theoretical lens having a resolution of @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bdfc_fig4](a ) . a corresponding analytical intensity plot of the two - slit image at the exit of the theoretical lens is shown in fig .  [ bdfc_fig4](b ) .",
    "for reference purposes , the theoretical curve for a lens with resolution of @xmath34 is plotted .",
    "this suggests that @xmath1 is 135 nm instead of 150 nm .",
    "note that the two peaks do not fit exactly simply because of the magnifying property of the hyperlens . nevertheless , as mentioned above",
    ", the magnification does nt impact the way the resolution is determined , since it s only the middle dip of the curve which matters .",
    "in summary , we presented an analytical method for determining the resolution of a metamaterials - based superlens by analyzing the transmitted field profile of a two - slit object .",
    "the experimental data of the near - field image profile was compared to analytical simulations of the transmitted near - field profile of a hypothetical two - slit object in the vicinity of a theoretical negative - index flat lens .",
    "the theoretical flat lens resolution can be varied , with small increments , to fit the experimental data . and",
    ", the best fit will reveal the resolution of the superlens . to demonstrate the validity of the method , we have computed the resolution of 3 superresolution lenses from the literature .",
    "moreover , for the last 2 example cases , we showed that the resolution predicted experimentally is slightly lower than the actual resolution of the lens .",
    "in other words , imaging would still be possible with slit object gaps reduced by 1015 nm .",
    "the method introduced in this letter is a useful and robust tool for accurately determining the resolution of fabricated superlenses .",
