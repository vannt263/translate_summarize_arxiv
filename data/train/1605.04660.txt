    "recently , `` ultra - long bursts '' , a subclass of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with unusually long central engine activity ( @xmath0 hours ) compared to typical grbs ( tens of seconds ) , have been paid great attention @xcite . in some references ,",
    "the  ultra - long \" grbs refered to the grbs with @xmath1-ray duration @xmath2 extending to @xmath3 s or even larger @xcite .",
    "some authors @xcite , on the other hand , argue that @xmath2 is not a reliable measure for defining  ultra - long \" grbs , taking into account the prolonged central engine activity time of some grbs , indicated by flares @xcite and shallow decay plateaus @xcite in the early x - ray afterglow light curves .",
    "they propose to redefine the burst duration as @xmath4 by taking into account both @xmath1-ray and the aforementioned x - ray light curve features .",
    "based on both observational analysis and numerical simulations , they found that bursts with duration @xmath2 of order @xmath5 s can be reproduced with a normal central engine , while bursts with @xmath6 s require an extended central engine activity , may be classified to the `` ultra - long '' population @xcite .",
    "even though lack of a clear definition , it is generally considered that the ultra - long grbs may have either a special central engine or a special progenitor @xcite .",
    "for instance , some authors @xcite proposed a blue supergiant - like progenitor for ultra - long grbs @xcite , considering their much larger radii could naturally explain the unusually long durations . on the other hand , it is also proposed that the ultra - long grbs may have a special central engine , such as a strongly magnetized millisecond neutron star ( a magnetar ) @xcite .",
    "research on the physical origin of ultra - long grbs would potentially promote our understanding of the central engine and progenitor of grbs .",
    "most recently , @xcite reported the first discovered association between an ultra - long grb and a supernova , i.e. , grb 111209a / sn 2011kl .",
    "based on the observed properties of sn 2011kl , such as its spectra and light curve shape , they rule out a blue supergiant progenitor and a tidal disruption interpretation for grb 111209a .",
    "nevertheless , based on the unexpected high luminosity of sn 2011kl , which is intermediate between canonical overluminous grb - associated supernovae and super - luminous supernovae @xcite , they suggest that @xmath7ni is not responsible for powering the luminosity of sn 2011kl , but an additional energy input is required .",
    "they thus propose that the central engine of grb 111209a might be a millisecond magnetar .",
    "considering the comprehensive observations of grb 111209a / sn 2011kl , especially that the late - time x - ray light curve of grb 111209a exhibits a grb 121027a - like fall - back bump @xcite , rather than obey the dipole radiation profile , the central engine of grb 111209a is more like a black hole ( bh ) instead of a magnetar .",
    "the question is could the bh central engine serve as the energy reservoir to power the abnormally luminous sn 2011kl ? in this work , we intend to interpret the broadband data of grb 111209a / sn 2011kl within the collapsar model : the grb central engine is a bh ; a fraction of the materials in the envelope would fall back and reactive the accretion onto the bh , tapping the spin energy of the bh to give rise the unusually long central engine activity timescale ; the energy and angular momentum could also be extracted magnetically from the revived accretion disc , depositing energy into the supernova ejecta to give rise the unusually high luminosity of sn 2011kl . in section 2 , we describe the observational features of grb 111209a .",
    "a general picture of the fall - back accretion model is given in section 3 and we apply this model to the broadband data of grb 111209a / sn 2011kl in section 4 . in section 5 , we briefly summarize our results and discuss the implication .",
    "grb 111209a was discovered at @xmath8 = 2011:12:09 - 07:12:08 ut on 9 december 2011 by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on board _ swift _ , and was later accurately located by xrt at a position of ra(j2000)=00@xmath9 57@xmath10 22.63@xmath11 and dec(j2000)=-46d 48@xmath12 03.8@xmath13 , with an estimated uncertainty of 0.5 arcsec @xcite .",
    "grb 111209a showed an extraordinarily long prompt duration , and was monitored up to @xmath14 s until bat entering the orbital gap region .",
    "it was also detected by the konus detector on the wind spacecraft @xcite .",
    "as shown in the ground data analysis of the konus - wind instrument , grb 111209a was recorded with a continuous coverage extending from 5,400 s before to 10,000 s after the swift trigger @xmath8 .    both very large telescope ( vlt)/x - shooter ( 2011 december 10 at 1:00 ut ) and gemini - n / gmos - n detected the early spectroscopy of the transient optical light of grb 111209a .",
    "a redshift of @xmath15 was suggested by the identify of absorption lines and emission lines from the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "based on the konus - wind results , grb 111209a had a fluence of @xmath16 erg @xmath17 @xcite , inferring an isotropic gamma - ray energy release @xmath18 erg .",
    "here we adopt the concordance cosmology with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    _",
    "swift_/xrt observations started at 425 s after the bat trigger @xcite , revealing a bright afterglow mainly with several components :    * an initial plateau phase overlapping with the prompt @xmath1-ray emission ; * after an observational gap , from @xmath22 s to @xmath23 s , the light curve rapidly rise back and then gradually steepen to a  steep decay \" phase with decay index of @xmath24 , behaving very likely the grb 121027a - like fall - back bump @xcite .",
    "* at very late time ( @xmath25 s ) , the tail of steep decay phase is superposed by another power - law component with decay index of @xmath26 , which is usually denoted as",
    " normal decay \" phase in the canonical picture of x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "the afterglow of grb 111209a was also clearly detected in the optical - uv band by _ swift_/uvot and other ground based instruments , such as the tarot - la silla @xcite and the seven - channel optcial / near - infrared imager grond @xcite .",
    "after the prompt optical flashes , the earlier optical afterglow shows a normal power - law decay until day 15 .",
    "and then , the optical light curve starts to deviate from the power - law decay and remains essentially flat between days 15 and 30 .",
    "after day 30 , the light curve starts to decay again , approaching the host - galaxy level .",
    "most recently , based on its temporal and spectral features , this excess emission is identified as a supernova , designated sn 2011kl , associated with grb 111209a @xcite .",
    "the bolometric peak luminosity of sn 2011kl is intermediate between canonical over - luminous grb - associated supernovae and super - luminous supernovae .",
    "in this work , we intend to use the collapsar model to interpret the broadband afterglow data of grb 111209a . the physical picture is as follows : the progenitor star has a core - envelope structure , as is common in stellar models .",
    "the bulk of the mass in the core part collapses into a rapidly spinning black hole ( bh ) , and the rest mass forms a surrounding accretion disc .",
    "the grb prompt emission can be powered by the blandford - znajek ( 1977 , hereafter bz ) mechanism , in which the spin energy of the bh is extracted via the open field lines penetrating the event horizon .",
    "an alternative mechanism for powering grb jet is the neutrino annihilation process , which is too `` dirty '' and inffective to account for long - term activity of grb , like ultra - long grbs ( fan et al .",
    "2005 ; lei et al .",
    "2009 , 2013 ; liu et al .",
    "the energy and angular momentum could also be extracted magnetically from accretions discs , by field lines that leave the disc surface and extend to large distance , centrifugally launching a baryon - rich wide wind / outflow through the blandford - payne ( blandford & payne 1982 , hereafter bp ) mechanism .",
    "the bounding shock responsible for the associated supernova and the bp outflow would transfer kinetic energy to the envelope materials . during the fall - back ,",
    "only a portion of the fall - back mass accretes onto the bh , while the rest is ejected in a disc wind @xcite .",
    "the more energetic the supernova shock , the less envelope material falls back into the center . for a parcel of gas of the progenitor star at radius @xmath27 , the fall - back time",
    "could be estimated as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the bh mass .",
    "the fall - back of the envelope materials may form a new accretion disc , powering the shallow decay phase or late flares seen in x - ray afterglow . the bp outflow from the new disc",
    "would further deposit energy into the supernova ejecta .",
    "based on some analytical and numerical calculations , the fall - back accretion rate initially increases with time as @xmath30 until it reaches a peak value at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "and then the late - time fall - back accretion behavior would follows @xmath32 , as suggested by @xcite until time @xmath33 , when most of the fall back materials fuel out and the accretion behavior could be described with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 depends on the stellar structure and rotation rate of progenitor star is inferred from the x - ray afterglow steep decay index . ] .",

    "as the first reported association between ultra - long grb and supernova , grb 111209a / sn 2011kl system provides us a good chance to study the properties of central engines or even progenitors for ultra - long grbs . in this work , we apply a fallback accretion scenario within the collapsar model to interpret the broadband data of grb 111209a / sn 2011kl .",
    "we find that with all standard parameter values , both x - ray and optical observations could be well explained . in our interpretation , the central bh mass , the fallback material mass and the supernova ejecta mass",
    "are adopted as @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath148 respectively , inferring that the total mass of the progenitor star is in order of @xmath150 .",
    "moreover , the outermost radius of the fallback material is estimated as @xmath151 cm , 5 times of solar radius . therefore , we suggest that the progenitor of grb 111209a is more likely a wolf - rayet star instead of blue supergiant star , which is consistent with the observational implications from @xcite , although we argue that the central engine of this ultra - long burst is a bh rather than a magnetar .",
    "the required magnetic field strength around bh is @xmath152 g , similar to the magnetar magnetic field properties ( @xmath153 g ) as proposed by @xcite .",
    "but the black hole spin period is around 0.3 ms , almost 2 orders of magnitude faster than the assumed magnetar spin ( @xmath154 ms ) .      under the framework of collapsar model , the central engine ( bh )",
    "activity timescale could have a wide range , depending not only on the size of the progenitor star , but also on the stellar structure and rotation rate of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the latter property would mainly affect the fallback process of the envelope material , which could largely extend the central engine activity time , having chance to give rise to the ultra - long grbs .",
    "on the other hand , the bounding shock responsible for the associated supernova and the bp outflow from the initial accretion disc would transfer kinetic energy to the envelope materials . if the injected kinetic energy is less than the potential energy of the envelop material , the starting time of the fallback would be delayed , which may even prolong the burst duration . however , if the injected kinetic energy is larger , which might be the majority cases , the fallback process is vanished and the central engine activity is relatively short , corresponding to the normal long grbs .",
    "it is worth noting that besides grb 111209a , the other grb that exhibits a fall - back bump in x - ray light curve , namely grb 121027a , is also an ultra - long burst @xcite .",
    "regardless of the fallback process , bp outflow would always deliver additional energy to the supernova ejecta , which may explain the fact that grb associated supernovae is usually a energetic hypernovae ( * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "for ultra - long grbs , where fallback accretion might perform , the associated supernovae could be even brighter , like sn 2011kl , since the bp outflow injection is largely prolonged .",
    "it is worth noticing that given the ejecta properties , such as its radial density profile , metallicity content and so on , the supernova spectrum is essentially determined by the total injected energy from the central engine , no matter the central engine is magnetar or black hole . for the case of sn 2011kl ,",
    "@xcite have carefully reproduced its spectrum within the magnetar central engine scenario and interpreted the observations . with the parameters presented in table 1 , it is easy to show that around the sn peak time ( @xmath155 s ) , the total injected energy from the bp outflow is similar to the magnetar injection with parameters adopted in @xcite .",
    "we thus claim that the sn spectrum from our model is expected to be similar with the results calculated in @xcite .    during the fallback ,",
    "the disk accretion rate ( @xmath156 ) is too low to ignite significant neutrino emission ( popham et al .",
    "1999 ; chen & beloborodov 2007 ) . as a concequence",
    ", the accretion flow could be dominated by advection at this stage , i.e. , an adaf , which has strong mass outflow due to its positive bernoulli constant .",
    "therefore , not all of the fallback mass accrete onto the black hole .",
    "in contrast , the majority are ejected in the disk wind ( kumar et al .",
    "macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 ) found that energy dissipation in the disk can launch a wind with significant @xmath7ni .",
    "the investigating by li et al .",
    "( 2016 ) indicate that large @xmath7ni mass are also produced in the magnetic outflow .",
    "this may give rise to the @xmath7ni mass observed in the nebular spectra of hypernovae through fe emission ( e.g. mazzali et al 2001 ) .",
    "numerical simulations suggested that the bz mechanism can power highly collimated grb jets .",
    "however , additional simulations will be needed to see whether the magnetically - driven disc wind could drive a more isotropic hypernova blast .",
