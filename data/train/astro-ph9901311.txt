    "deep surveys of the submillimeter sky using the submillimeter common  user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope have uncovered a population of distant dust  rich galaxies ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; blain et al .",

    "follow - up optical spectroscopy places the sub - mm source at a redshift of approximately @xmath6 ( barger et al .",
    "1999 ; ivison et al.1999 ) .",
    "smmj14011 appears to be a merger / interacting system which has optical and radio properties consistent with an ultraluminous starburst ( ivison et al .",
    "1999 ) , albeit the presence of a heavily obscured agn can not be ruled out .",
    "the amplification factor for smmj14011 is @xmath7 , where the uncertainty comes from the allowed range of detailed mass models of the foreground cluster .",
    "smmj14011 was observed using the owens valley millimeter array between 1998 october and december .",
    "a total of 41 hours of usable integration time on source was obtained in two configurations of six 10.4 m telescopes .",
    "the phase center for the co observations was the position of the brightest optical component of the smmj14011 system ( j1 ) ; @xmath8(j2000)=@xmath9 ; @xmath10(j2000)=@xmath11 ( ivison et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the co(3@xmath02 ) line was observed using a digital correlator configured with @xmath12  mhz channels centered on 96.9975 ghz in the lower side  band , corresponding to co(3@xmath02 ) emission at the h@xmath8 redshift of @xmath1 ( ivison et al .",
    "typical single  sideband system temperatures were approximately 300350 k , corrected for telescope losses and the atmosphere .",
    "in addition to the co line data , we recorded the 3 mm continuum data with a 1 ghz bandwidth for both the upper ( line  free , centered on 99.9975 ghz ) and lower sidebands .",
    "the nearby quasar 1413 + 135 was observed every 25 minutes for gain and phase calibration .",

    "the co position ( table  1 ) is consistent with the optical position of smmj14011 within the uncertainties of the data sets .",
    "the co map shows marginal evidence for emission extended toward the south , but observations at higher resolution are required to test this possibility .",

    "the inferred molecular gas mass of smmj14011 is @xmath29 , which is consistent with that of the most massive low  redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the implied gas  to  dust ratio for smmj14011 is @xmath30200900 , assuming a reasonable range of possible dust temperatures ( 3070k ) .",
    "these gas  to  dust ratios are similar to those seen in spiral galaxies ( devereux & young 1990 ) , local uligs ( sanders et al .",
    "1991 ) , and other high  redshift co sources .",
    "the similarities of the derived gas  to  dust ratios at high  redshift reflect the small scatter ( only a factor of 23 ) in their @xmath31 luminosity ratios .",
    "these results are somewhat remarkable considering that some of the sources are more likely dominated by agns than others and considering the possibility of different dust temperatures .",
    "the observed line width for smmj14011 ( fwhm=@xmath32 ) is much narrower than that observed for smmj02399 ( @xmath33 ) , but is within the range of values typically observed for uligs ( 200@xmath34 ; solomon et al .",
    "the narrow line ",
    "width may indicate that we are viewing the system somewhat face - on . by using the observed line width and the upper limit on the co source size of @xmath35",
    ", we can constrain the total dynamical mass contained within the co emission regions .",
    "the angular size limit corresponds to a maximum linear diameter of @xmath36 kpc at @xmath1 , or @xmath37 kpc after correcting for lensing .",
    "the dynamical mass is @xmath38)^2/g$ ] , where @xmath39 is the observed fwhm line width and @xmath40 is the inclination .",
    "we find @xmath41 which is consistent with the derived gas mass , provided @xmath42 .",
    "the intrinsic far  infrared luminosity of smmj14011 is approximately @xmath43 . if its luminosity is powered by star ",
    "formation , as suggested by the optical data ( ivison et al .",
    "1999 ) , the implied star  formation rate of massive stars ( @xmath44 ) is @xmath45 ( condon 1992 ) . including the presence of low mass stars , the total star formation rate would be of order @xmath46 .",
    "the co data is consistent with this view by showing the presence of enough gaseous material to support a high level of star formation .",
    "the large molecular gas mass and the high star - formation rate suggest a starburst time scale of order @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , the far - infrared  to  radio flux ratio for smmj14011 is the same as that found for nearby starburst galaxies ( condon , frayer , & broderick 1991 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if smmj14011 is powered by an agn , the agn could not be a powerful radio source ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the success of the first two searches for co from the high  redshift submillimeter  selected galaxies is encouraging .",
    "unlike smmj02399 , whose uv / optical spectral properties show significant agn activity , there is currently no evidence for an agn in smmj14011 .",
    "however , the presence of a dust  enshrouded agn can not be completely ruled out . even though the uv / optical characteristics of smmj14011 and smmj02399 appear different , their radio , submillimeter , and co properties are fairly similar and suggest that star formation is important in the far  infrared emission of both sources . smmj14011 and",
    "smmj02399 share many of the same properties of the local population of uligs , such as ( 1 ) high infrared luminosities , ( 2 ) associated with mergers , ( 3 ) large reservoirs of molecular gas , and ( 4 ) comparable co line widths .",
    "the most important distinction is that the high - redshift sub - mm galaxies are about a factor of @xmath49@xmath50 times more numerous per unit co  moving volume than the low redshift uligs ( kim & sanders 1998 ) .",
    "the sub - mm galaxies may also have slightly larger amounts of molecular gas ( by factors of 23 ) than typical uligs .",
    "figure  3 shows the co luminosities plotted as a function of redshift .",
    "when lensing corrections are taken into account , the high  redshift sources have similar co luminosities to the most luminous low redshift uligs .",
    "these consistencies could suggest roughly similar gas masses in the progenitor systems or may indicate the importance of self  regulating mechanisms such as galactic winds ( heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ) .",
    "for comparison , theoretical evolutionary curves are also presented in figure  3 .",
    "we show three models based on numerical calculations of chemical evolution ( frayer & brown 1997 ) .",
    "the models are designed to represent a spiral galaxy , an elliptical galaxy , and a merger event .",
    "all three models start as purely gaseous systems with zero metallicity .",
    "the spiral galaxy model uses an infall model ( run  11 of frayer & brown 1997 ) which starts at @xmath51 and reaches a final mass similar to that of the current milky way disk ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the co luminosity of a disk with the mass of the milky way is never expected to reach the high co luminosities ( @xmath53 ) observed in the high - redshift systems .",
    "for the elliptical galaxy model , we assume a closed - box model ( run  8 of frayer & brown 1997 ) with a mass of @xmath54 which begins its evolution at @xmath51 .",
    "although galactic systems are not expected to evolve in such a simple manner , the closed - box model is able to match the high co luminosities detected at high redshift and the low co luminosities ( @xmath55 ) observed for local elliptical galaxies ( wiklind , combes , & henkel 1995 ) .",
    "the third model in figure  3 is a more realistic model for smmj14011 and smmj02399 .",
    "it assumes a starburst resulting from the merger of two @xmath56 gaseous systems at @xmath57 .",
    "this starburst model uses the parameters of run  8 in frayer & brown ( 1997 ) , except for a factor of 10 increase in the star formation efficiency and assumes a formation time scale of @xmath58 for the merger ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) .",
    "these theoretical calculations only show the approximate evolution expected for different types of galactic systems and depend strongly on the parameters governing star formation , the initial mass function , infall , and cosmology .",
    "an important unanswered question is what will smmj14011 evolve into at the present epoch . by using the",
    "observed near  infrared k - band flux density ( ivison et al .",
    "1999 ) and assuming the burst model from bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , smmj14011 has already formed of order @xmath59 of stars .",
    "there is enough molecular gas present to form an additional @xmath60 galaxy ( adopting @xmath61 per @xmath60 ) , suggesting that smmj14011 will evolve into a @xmath62@xmath63 galaxy .",
    "given that the low ",
    "redshift uligs may eventually evolve into elliptical galaxies ( kormendy & sanders 1992 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) , the high - redshift sub - mm population could represent luminous elliptical galaxies in their formative phases ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ; eales et al .",
    "the consistency of this hypothesis can be checked by comparing the number density of the sub - mm population represented by smmj14011 and smmj02399 with that of luminous ellipticals at low redshift . within an effective source plane area of 25 square arcminutes , smail et al .",
    "( 1998b ) have detected 9 distant , non - cluster , sub - mm sources above the @xmath64 noise level .",
    "smmj14011 and smmj02399 represent about 20% of this sample .",
    "the corresponding number density of such sources per unit co - moving volume within the redshift range of @xmath655 is approximately @xmath66 .",
    "the number density of luminous elliptical galaxies found at low redshift is roughly similar ( loveday et al.1992 ) .",
    "although no definitive conclusions can be made due to the small sample size , the current data are at least consistent with the sub - mm population evolving into the luminous elliptical galaxies at the present epoch .",
    "we report the detection of co in a second ultraluminous galaxy , smmj14011 , selected from a submillimeter survey of the distant universe ( smail et al .",
    "the co emission is coincident in position and redshift with the optical counterpart of smmj14011 and indicates the presence of approximately @xmath67 of molecular gas .",
    "both smmj14011 and the first high - redshift sub - mm galaxy , smmj02399 , show co emission and are thought to be associated with a major burst of star formation .",
    "the massive molecular gas reservoirs of smmj14011 and smmj02399 and their co - moving number densities are consistent with these sources evolving into present day luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "further observations are needed to constrain the redshift distribution and the molecular gas masses of sub - mm population in order to test the generality of these early results .",
    "we thank our colleagues at the owens valley millimeter array who have helped make these observations possible .",
