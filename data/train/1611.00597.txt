    "among numerous different nuclear many - body models , the nuclear density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite is the only one , which can describe nuclear properties microscopically throughout the entire nuclear landscape  @xcite .",
    "the cornerstone of the nuclear dft is the energy density functional ( edf ) , which incorporates nucleonic interactions and many - body correlations into a functional constructed from one - body densities and currents .",
    "the skyrme edf , for its part , relies on local nuclear densities and currents , together with a set of coupling constants as model parameters . due to the lack of suitable _",
    "ab - initio _ methods to compute these coupling constants , they must be determined through adjustment to experimental data , such as nuclear binding energies and radii .    during the last couple of decades ,",
    "numerous skyrme parameterizations have been obtained from various adjustment schemes , see e.g. the list in  @xcite .",
    "the standard skyrme edf has proven to be quite successful , but its limitations have also become apparent . for the sake of better accuracy , more reliable predictive power , and for a spectroscopic - quality level , one has to move beyond the the standard skyrme edf  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , by studying the performance and predictive power of the present edfs , valuable information can be obtained which can be used and applied in the work towards forthcoming novel edfs  @xcite .",
    "as with every model parameters optimization procedure , one of the main challenges is to find the best set of input observables , in order to constrain the parameter space of the model .",
    "the predictive power of the edf highly depends on the input data .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive analysis of the impact of input observables on the parameter space and on the model predictions provides valuable information . naturally , the nuclear bulk properties are crucial for general constraining and the data especially relating to odd - mass nuclei is important for spectroscopical properties  @xcite .",
    "binding energies , surface thickness , charge radii , single particle energies and energies of giant resonances are essential properties of nuclei , and used in various edf optimization schemes .    all model predictions contain several sources of uncertainties .",
    "roughly speaking , these can be divided into two main categories , the systematic model uncertainties and the statistical model uncertainties .",
    "the systematic model uncertainty stems from sources like the model deficiency and input data bias .",
    "the statistical uncertainty results from the model parameter optimization process .    despite the importance of uncertainty analysis ,",
    "error estimate is a rather novel topic in low - energy nuclear physics  @xcite . during the last few years",
    ", efforts have been made to improve this situation in the edf calculations  @xcite , as well as in the domain of _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite .",
    "various statistical tools have been applied from traditional methods to more modern ones ( e.g. the bayesian framework  @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the fact that uncertainty quantification is an important topic in itself , with the help of statistical analysis , information about shortcomings of theoretical models and optimization procedures is also obtained .    in this work ,",
    "we present the quantitative results for statistical uncertainty propagation for three existing unedf skyrme edf models : the unedf0  @xcite , the unedf1  @xcite , and the unedf2  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we quantify contributions from the model parameters to the total error budget of binding energy in isotopic and isotonic chains of nuclei . by analyzing the obtained information we may recognize potential frailties of these models . in the present study ,",
    "two - neutron separation energies are also considered and the related uncertainties are worked out . in addition to",
    "even - even nuclei , uncertainties related to odd - even nuclei are studied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theorframe ] we briefly review the theoretical framework related to the topic : namely , the skyrme energy density functional and the error propagation . in sec .  [ sec : results ] we present our results and , finally , conclusions and future perspectives are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the unedf models are based on the skyrme energy density .",
    "the ground state of a nucleus is determined in the framework of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory  @xcite .",
    "the three parameterizations considered in this work , unedf0 , unedf1 and unedf2 , were adjusted on a experimental data consisting of binding energies for deformed and spherical nuclei , odd - even mass differences , and charge radii .",
    "in addition , latter parameterizations include data on fission isomer excitation energies and single - particle energies .",
    "the skyrme edf has a form of local energy density functional , stemming from skyrme energy density .",
    "it can be written as @xmath0 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the energy density @xmath1 is a time - even , scalar , isoscalar and real function of local densities and their derivatives . in the equation  ( [ eq : skyrmee ] ) , the skyrme energy density has been split into kinetic term @xmath2 , isoscalar ( @xmath3 ) and isovector ( @xmath4 ) particle - hole skyrme energy densities @xmath5 , pairing energy density @xmath6 and coulomb term @xmath7 .",
    "the time - even part of the isoscalar and isovector particle - hole skyrme energy densities is given by @xmath8 in the equation  ( [ eq : phterm ] ) , @xmath9 is the isoscalar or isovector kinetic density and @xmath10 is the spin - current density tensor .",
    "definitions of these densities can be found in reference  @xcite . with the unedf models ,",
    "only the time - even part of the total energy density was defined and time - odd part of the energy density was set to zero .",
    "the energy density is always time - even , also the part called  time - odd  - the time - odd energy density means that this part of the energy density is built by using time - odd densities .",
    "the pairing energy density @xmath6 used here has the form of @xmath11 \\widetilde{\\rho}_q^2 ( \\mathbf{r } ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the pairing strength parameters for neutrons and protons , respectively , and @xmath14 was set to the equilibrium density @xmath15@xmath16 .",
    "all the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath12 are real constants , except the coefficients @xmath18 which depend on the isoscalar density so that @xmath19 altogether , there are 13 independent constants from skyrme energy density and two constants from pairing , namely @xmath20 seven of these parameters for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , can be written with the help of the infinite nuclear matter parameters  @xcite .",
    "all in all , the model depends on 15 independent parameters , namely @xmath25 which were optimized in the previous works , in references  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath26 is the saturation density , @xmath27 represents the total energy per nucleon at equilibrium , @xmath28 is the nuclear matter incompressibility , @xmath29 is the symmetry energy coefficient , @xmath30 describes the slope of the symmetry energy , @xmath31 is the isoscalar effective mass and the last one , @xmath32 , is the isovector effective mass .    in the present work ,",
    "we have compared calculated theoretical binding energies to the experimental ones from  @xcite . in order to obtain experimental nuclear binding energies ,",
    "the experimental atomic masses were corrected by taking into account the electron binding energies , approximated as @xmath33      lccccccccccc edf & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 + unedf0 & x & x & & x & x & &  & x & x & x & ",

    "+    [ tab : unedfpara ]    the unedf parameterizations were accompanied by sensitivity analysis , providing covariance matrix of the model parameters .",
    "this allows to calculate the standard deviation of any observable predicted by the model . in the present work we consider the statistical errors on binding energies and on two neutron separation energies .",
    "the statistical standard deviation @xmath42 of an observed variable @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 \\left[\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_j}\\right ] \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the covariance matrix element between the model parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the number of model parameters .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath45 is related to the corresponding correlation matrix @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the standard deviations of parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the correlation matrices of the unedf models and the standard deviations of the model parameters are given in [ app : appendixa ] .",
    "some of the unedf model parameters have been excluded from this sensitivity analysis .",
    "table  [ tab : unedfpara ] lists those unedf parameters which were included in the sensitivity analysis  @xcite ( marked with @xmath53 ) , those which were fixed during the whole optimization procedure ( - ) and those which ended up at their boundaries during the optimization ( empty space ) .",
    "sensitivity analysis can not be performed for fixed parameters or those which drifted onto the boundary during the optimization .",
    "however , those parameters which were included in sensitivity analysis have a visible contribution to the statistical error of an observable and their contribution to the total error budget can be calculated from equation  ( [ eq : sigma2 ] ) .      in the present work we used the code hfbtho  @xcite to calculate observables and their statistical errors .",
    "the program solves the hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations for skyrme edfs in the axially symmetric harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "time - reversal and parity symmetries were assumed . because particle number is not a good quantum number in hfb theory",
    ", we used the lipkin - nogami method to restore it approximately .",
    "the hfb equations were solved in a basis consisting of 20 oscillator shells and the convergence criteria was set to @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the desired accuracy has been reached when the norm of the hfb matrix difference between two iterations is less than @xmath54 .",
    "both of the coulomb terms , @xmath55 and @xmath56 were used , but the exchange term was calculated by using slater approximation . a rough position of the energy minimum , with respect of quadrupole deformation , was first located from a constrained hfb calculation .",
    "then , an unconstrained hfb calculation was performe in order to converge to the precise position of the energy minimum .    in order to obtain standard errors",
    "one has to calculate the derivatives of an observable @xmath57 with respect to the model parameters @xmath46 , as in equation  ( [ eq : sigma2 ] ) . in the present work",
    "these derivatives were approximated by a finite differences .",
    "that is @xmath58 where value of @xmath59th parameter has been shifted by amount of @xmath60 from the model base values .",
    "the rounded values of unedf parameters and corresponding shifts @xmath60 have been listed on table  [ tab : parsteps ] .",
    "we tested that the computed statistical errors remained essentially the same when shift parameters @xmath60 were slightly varied .",
    "lastly , we recall that standard deviation does not measure the total uncertainty of a model . another main ingredient , namely the systematic error , is much more challenging to assess . it can be addressed e.g. by studying a dispersion of different predictions given by various skyrme edf models  @xcite .",
    "however , due to lack of exact reference model , precise systematic errors are not within one s reach .",
    "the differences between the theoretical and experimental binding energies for even - even gadolinium and dysprosium isotopes are shown in figure  [ fig : gddy_residuals ] .",
    "the error bars represent the calculated theoretical standard deviations , and they are also given as a function of the mass number in the graphs on the right .",
    "the uncertainties are given for all the calculated binding energies , including also those nuclei for which the experimental binding energy is not currently known .",
    "as it can be seen , unedf0 gives more consistent results with the measured experimental energies for lighter isotopes , whereas unedf1 and unedf2 seem to improve their accuracy considerably for heavier isotopes .",
    "most of the theoretical results do not overlap with the experimental values , even when including error bars .",
    "two interesting points can be seen in the graphs on the left : @xmath61gd and @xmath62dy . both of these nuclei have neutron number of @xmath63 , that is , one of the magic numbers . here , the theoretical predictions for the binding energies given by unedf1 and unedf2 are comparatively farther away from the experimental results .",
    "however , there is no visible increase in the standard deviation of the binding energy of these two nuclei .",
    "this suggests that the increased residual is due to underlying model deficiency , and not due to the parameter optimization procedure .",
    "the calculated standard deviations of binding energies are found to be around 0.53.0mev , 0.41.7mev , and 0.31.5mev for unedf0 , unedf1 and unedf2 , respectively .",
    "even though the standard deviations have a magnitude of one thousandth of the total binding energy , the theoretical uncertainties are still far larger compared to experimental precision , which can be of the order of few kev s  @xcite .",
    "however , uncertainties of the unedf models have decreased after every model : the obtained standard deviation for unedf0 is larger compared to two later parameterizations .",
    "the behavior of uncertainty is relatively smooth and the uncertainty of binding energy grows quickly when going towards neutron rich nuclei .",
    "in addition , one can also see that uncertainties grow when going towards the other extreme , namely proton rich nuclei .",
    "this is an indication that isovector part of the edfs is not as well constrained as the isoscalar part .",
    "but for two neutron separation energy @xmath64.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the residuals of the two neutrons separation energy , @xmath65 , are shown in figure  [ fig : gddy_sep_res ] .",
    "two neutron separation energies were calculated for even - even dy and gd isotopes .",
    "similarly to the previous figure , theoretical errors are marked as error bars in the graphs on the left hand side panels , and also given as a function of mass number on the right hand side panels .",
    "the theoretical statistical error is calculated similarly , through finite differences of @xmath65 values to compute the derivatives . for neutron",
    "rich nuclei , all three parameterizations give essentially the same result for @xmath65 , within the error bars .",
    "otherwise , the latest unedf2 parameterization seems to differ most from the experimental results when compared to previous two parameterizations .",
    "since @xmath64 is defined as a difference of two binding energies , the partial derivatives are also calculated from energy difference between two nucleus . as a consequence",
    ", some of the parameter uncertainties can cancel each other . in particularly , the uncertainty coming from a relatively less constrained isovector part of the edf is now partly canceled , resulting to more moderate uncertainty in the neutron rich region compared to the uncertainty of binding energy .",
    "similar observation was also done at  @xcite .     as a function of mass number @xmath66 .",
    "right panel : calculated statistical error of @xmath67 when using either lowest or secondary energy minimum of @xmath68gd.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    one common feature for all unedf models is an existence of a few high peaks in the statistical error of @xmath64 .",
    "these peaks are located mainly around the same neutron numbers for gd and dy isotopes .",
    "for instance , the two highest peaks given by unedf2 are located at the nuclei @xmath68gd and @xmath69dy .",
    "the explanation for all of the high peaks can be found in a sudden change in deformation .",
    "figure  [ fig : betas_minimum ] , in panel a , shows how deformation parameter @xmath70 varies with mass number @xmath66 for gd . when comparing this to that of @xmath67 , shown in figure  [ fig : gddy_sep_res ]",
    ", one can notice similarity between uncertainty peaks and large change in the deformation .",
    "if there is a significant difference in deformation between two consecutive even - even nuclei , this results to a larger statistical error of two neutron separation energy .    .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the relationship between @xmath67 and a sudden large change of @xmath70 can be tested by by looking at the secondary local minimum of the deformation energy landscape . for the calculated gd and dy nuclei , there usually exists two energy minima , the oblate one and the prolate one , as shown in figure  [ fig : dy_defe_behav ] . by picking always the lowest minimum results to large statistical error of @xmath64 when deformation has a large change between two even nucleus .",
    "however , if one uses the secondary minimum , in which case the two nuclei appearing in the expression of @xmath64 have similar deformation compared to the each other , one obtains substantially smaller @xmath67 . in figure",
    "[ fig : betas_minimum ] , panel b , the black line describes the same peak at @xmath71 given by unedf2 as in figure  [ fig : gddy_sep_res ] , calculated with the lowest energy minima .",
    "the second ( red ) line corresponds to case where second minimum of @xmath68gd was used , resulting a much smaller @xmath67 for @xmath68gd .",
    "indeed , a large difference in deformation of involved nuclei seems to give large uncertainty on two neutron separation energy .",
    "a possible explanation is considerably different shell structure between these two nuclei due to deformation .",
    "the largest impact on the extremely high peaks in @xmath67 given by unedf2 is due to the parameter @xmath72 , whereas for unedf1 the main contributors are @xmath31 , both @xmath73 together with @xmath74 and @xmath75 parameters .    , but for the isotonic chain with the neutron number @xmath76.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the binding energy residuals between theory and experiment for isotonic chain of @xmath76 can be found in figure  [ fig : isotonic_residuals ] .",
    "only even - even nuclei are studied .",
    "the unedf1 and unedf2 parameterizations give rather similar results , but the binding energy behavior of unedf0 parameterization is notably different .",
    "compared to the unedf0 optimization procedure , in the optimization of unedf1 the same set of 12 edf parameters were optimized but seven additional data points were included in the database and the center of mass correction was neglected  @xcite . the other important remark is the fact that even though the trend of unedf1 and unedf2 models is incorrect  the calculated binding energies for proton rich nuclei are getting further far away from the experimental ones when mass number increases  the uncertainties do not nevertheless become larger .",
    "but for even - even and even - odd sn isotopes.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we have also considered the statistical error of odd - even nuclei . the binding energy residual for sn isotopic chain",
    "was computed by using all three unedf models .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : sn_residual ] .",
    "the odd - even nuclei were calculated by using the quasiparticle blocking procedure with the equal filling approximation  @xcite .",
    "the same blocking configuration , which corresponded the lowest energy with unshifted parameterization , was used for calculation of all partial derivatives .",
    "the same set of results for even sn isotopes , with unedf0 , was calculated in  @xcite .",
    "the results show that the binding energy residuals of even - even nuclei are relatively greater compared to those of odd nuclei . on this account",
    ", the binding energy residuals stagger between the odd and even nuclei .",
    "nevertheless , there are no visible odd - even effects in the standard deviations of binding energy .",
    "this can be explained by the lack of time - odd part in the used edfs .",
    "one of the goals of present work is to study contributions of the model parameters to the total error budget of binding energy . in practice ,",
    "the components of the total error are calculated by using equation  ( [ eq : sigma2 ] ) so that contributions from each 2nd summation index are given term by term whereas the 1st summation index is summed over all parameters .",
    "thus the total squared standard deviation is a sum of all these components .",
    "some of these components have a negative sign , due to a negative partial derivative or a negative covariance matrix element .",
    "the total squared standard deviation is always , nevertheless , a positive number .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the contribution of a parameter to the standard deviation is visible only if this parameter was included in the sensitivity analysis , as mentioned before .",
    "for even - even dy isotopes with unedf0 , unedf1 and unedf2 edfs.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]     but for the isotonic chain @xmath76.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the results for the model parameters contributions are shown in figure  [ fig : dycomponents ] for the binding energies of even dy isotopes and in figure  [ fig : isotonic_components ] for the binding energies of even @xmath76 isotones .",
    "the error budget for unedf0 binding energy is mainly composed of only a few contributing parameters . for the nuclei close to the valley of stability ,",
    "two dominant sources of uncertainty are the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath77 , whereas in the neutron rich dy isotopes parameters @xmath30 and @xmath29 dominate .",
    "in other words , model parameters related to symmetry energy become more important with neutron rich nuclei .",
    "it was found earlier that @xmath30 has also a strong impact on the statistical error of neutron root - mean - square radii and neutron skin thickness  @xcite .",
    "the most dominant sources of uncertainty are the same for isotopic and isotonic chains .    contrary to unedf0 ,",
    "the error budget of latter two parameterizations is more split among various model parameters . generally speaking",
    ", @xmath78 , both @xmath79 parameters , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 have a significant impact on the total error budget with unedf2 .",
    "it should be noticed that the correlation between @xmath77 and @xmath81 is strong : in principle , if one can reduce the uncertainty on @xmath77 , it should also reduce the uncertainty of @xmath81 . the isovector parameters , for their part , are difficult to constrain , but they impact on the stability of the functional : for instance @xmath82 is the coupling constant of the gradient term , which has been found to trigger scalar - isovector instabilities  @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have calculated statistical errors of the unedf models for binding energy and for two neutron separation energy by using the knowledge of the covariance matrix of the model parameters . the standard deviation has been interpreted as a statistical error .",
    "we have also quantified the contributions of each model parameters to the total error budget and checked if there are any visible odd - even effects in the uncertainties of the unedf models .",
    "we found out that the standard deviation grows quickly when going away from the valley of stability towards proton rich or neutron rich nuclei .",
    "that is , the predictive power of unedf models becomes weaker when going further away from known nuclei to the region where the models are used for extrapolating .",
    "for the sn isotopic chain , even though there exists odd - even staggering in the residuals of binding energies , no visible odd - even effect is seen in the related errors .",
    "the error budget of the unedf parameterizations becomes more evenly split among various model parameters with unedf1 and unedf2 parameterizations .",
    "the most dominant contributors to the error budget of neutron rich nuclei with unedf0 were @xmath83 and @xmath78 , that is to say , coefficients related to the symmetry energy . in the case of unedf1 , @xmath83 and @xmath78 still have a significant contribution and , in addition , the role of @xmath84 and @xmath81 becomes important .",
    "with unedf2 , the role of other model parameters becomes even more prominent .",
    "a comparison of the standard deviations to the residuals seems to point out that the underlying theoretical model is missing some important physics .",
    "one clear indication of this is the increase of the binding energy residuals close to the semi - magic nuclei .",
    "however , calculated standard deviation does not usually reflect this kind of behavior .",
    "similar observation was also done in  @xcite .",
    "also , the systematically incorrect trend of unedf1 and unedf2 with the binding energy residual in the @xmath76 isotonic chain does not appear in theoretical uncertainties , as shown in figure  [ fig : isotonic_residuals ] .",
    "the trend in the unedf statistical errors is such that the calculated standard deviation decreases as more data is included in the optimization procedure . from a statistical point of view , the larger uncertainty of the isovector parameters reflects to the increasing uncertainty when going towards both isospin extremes .",
    "unfortunately , new data may not always help to reduce uncertainties .",
    "a sophisticated parameter optimization within bayesian framework showed that new data points on nuclear binding energies at neutron rich region were not able provide a better constraint for the unedf1 model parameters  @xcite . on the other hand , data on the neutron skin thickness",
    "could potentially help to reduce uncertainties related on isovector model parameters  @xcite .    as was concluded for the unedf2 parameterization ,",
    "the limits of standard skyrme - edfs have been reached and novel approaches are called for  @xcite .",
    "information about the shortcomings and uncertainties of present models will provide valuable input for development of novel edf models .",
