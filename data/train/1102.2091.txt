    "modern man is exposed to a constant stream of news which we resorb , read , digest , discuss , disseminate and forget .",
    "most news items are of relatively little impact .",
    "they receive a small amount of public attention over a short time and quickly descend into public oblivion",
    ". however , occasionally news reports have a massive impact so that they can overthrow public opinions , heralded beliefs and even governments .",
    "a recent example are the 2010 - 2011 tunisian protests being sparked by reports of police use of tear gas against young demonstrators .",
    "of course , the reasons for these protests go far beyond this single incident , they involve multiple political , social and economical dimensions .",
    "it is remarkable how reports about such relatively small incidents propagate under certain circumstances through a society ",
    "i.e. a strongly interconnected system  and trigger a nation - wide revolution , while under under circumstances the news will practically vanish unheard .",
    "it is tempting to see such media events as a human , social excitable medium .",
    "one may view them as a social analog to earthquakes @xcite .",
    "external stimuli trigger relaxation events where accumulated `` energy '' is discharged or spread within a complex , networked system .",
    "this phenomenon can also be observed in other excitable media such as the brain @xcite , oscillating chemical reactions like the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite or the mexican wave ( or _ la ola _ ) at sport events @xcite .    are there quantitative patterns in the way societies react to the arrival of breaking news",
    "? how can the impact of a news items be quantified ?",
    "how long and with which intensity do people devote their attention to current news ?",
    "such research questions become amenable to quantitative study through online news discussions . in recent years",
    "weblogging ( or blogging ) has emerged as a new publishing medium at the grassroots level of society .",
    "a blog is usually defined as a web page with entries listed in reverse chronological order , maintained by one or several writers .",
    "blogs are often devoted to a unique topic , such as politics , finance or sports , and provide news or commentaries , often several times per day . in fall 2007",
    "the blog search engine technorati.com stopped tracking the number of active blogs once it exceeded 100 million .",
    "this rapid development sparked academic interest .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the _ blogosphere _ , defined as the collection of all blogs at a given time , has been studied from a network perspective @xcite , where nodes are blogs which are connected if one blog possesses a hyper - link or url to the other one .",
    "the spreading of news items can be seen as a diffusion process on this network @xcite .",
    "the accelerating shift of human conversations and discussions toward online media like blogs , twitter , etc . has reached a point where web data mining techniques @xcite can be used to e.g. predict spikes of sales ranks of books @xcite , measure public sentiments towards societal issues @xcite or predict stock market movements @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the impact of news reports on a small segment of the blogosphere by looking at timeseries of word frequencies .",
    "the sample contains blogs covering us domestic politics over a period of nearly two years .",
    "blogs are typically not the first to report a story .",
    "they pick up developing news topics and offer comments and subjective points of view .",
    "they are therefore an ideal candidate to measure how the public digests news .",
    "we show that the public reception of news reports follow a similar statistic as earthquakes do .",
    "the intensity of fore- and aftershocks can be described by a power law in analogy to omori s law @xcite , the size distribution of media events follows a gutenberg - richter law @xcite .",
    "it has been reported previously that omori s law holds for the round - trip times of data packages in the internet @xcite .",
    "power law signatures in human activity have recently been found in the distributions of waiting times between a catastrophe and humanitarian responses @xcite or between contributions to a discussion in online forums @xcite .",
    "a dataset of 168 large and massively popular blogs devoted to us domestic politics covering the entire political spectrum was compiled .",
    "the blog authors include popular political journalists ( e.g. glenn beck or taylor marsh ) as well as a number of self - pronounced political commentators labeling themselves everything from far right to liberal curmudgeons. we recorded the content of each blog entry with a time stamp with a resolution of one second .",
    "we focus on the time period of 670 days between july 1@xmath0 2008 and may 3@xmath1 2010 . as the dominant themes this period contains the 2008 us presidential elections , the advent of sarah palin , the health care reform and the iraq torture scandal .",
    "we developed a proprietary web crawler that continually crawls specified websites .",
    "the crawler can be targeted to a web page of a blog containing a blog entry of a given date .",
    "the content of this site is automatically parsed and checked for hyper - links to other blog entries .",
    "if a new link is found the linked page is downloaded and stored .",
    "the software then analyzes the structure of the blog entry , identifying and storing its date , headline , and entire content .",
    "once all links in the web page containing the blog entry have been identified the initial blog page is searched for a link to another web page containing older entries of the same blog .",
    "this procedure is repeated as long as older entries are found .",
    "the crawler is implemented in the java programming language in a fully object oriented fashion .",
    "all collected data is stored in a sql database allowing efficient subsequent sorting and filtering .",
    "filtering and pre - precessing was done by removal of all short high frequency words e.g. the or and , and removal of plural - s and other frequent endings such as ing or ed.    we will refer to words surrounding political topics actively discussed in the blogosphere by keywords. they were extracted by the following procedure .",
    "the frequency of all @xmath2 possible letter triplets ( that is aaa , aab , @xmath3 , zzz ) was counted over all blog entries for each day .",
    "nearly 50% of these triplets where discarded since they never occurred . from the remaining triplets we extracted the time series of daily frequencies and looked at their co - occurrences with words .",
    "in particular , for each remaining triplet we searched for the day with the highest frequency , assume this day is @xmath4 . for this day",
    "a list of all words containing the triplet was made .",
    "for each word from this list the time series of daily word frequencies in the range between thirty days before and after @xmath4 was extracted .",
    "the word was kept for further analyses only if its daily word frequency has a maximum value within this range at @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure left us with approximately 4000 keywords .",

    "an event is ( somewhat arbitrarily ) identified as a strong increase in word frequencies over a short period of time , with a subsequent decay to ( usually ) the previous levels .",
    "the time at which the peak occurs within an event is @xmath4 .",
    "the _ event - size _ @xmath8 is defined by the peak level of word frequency relative to the average level within a timespan @xmath9 before and after the peak level during the event .",

    "the event - size for word @xmath6 at peak - time @xmath4 is @xmath11 two classes of response functions in social systems have been previously identified : endogenous and exogenous , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "endogenous events start with a phase of pre - cursory growth , exogenous ones by a sudden burst in word frequencies .",
    "both types of events are followed by a relaxation process after the peak is reached .",
    "it usually follows a power law .",
    "an example for an exogenous event is the nomination of sarah palin as vice presidential candidate in the 2008 us presidential elections .",
    "[ exoendo](a ) , shows the word frequencies of palin before and after her nomination .",

    "the exogenous case ( blue circles , dotted line ) can be fitted by a gutenberg - richter law with exponent @xmath14 ( green solid line ) .",
    "the exponent for the endogenous event sizes ( red squares , dashed line ) is @xmath15 ( black dash - dotted line ) , close to the typical value for earthquakes.,height=188 ]    it has been suggested @xcite that word frequencies before and after an endogenous event at time @xmath4 follow power laws of the form @xmath16 where in general the growth exponents before the peak at @xmath4 , @xmath17 , and the decay exponent after @xmath4 , @xmath18 , can be different . for the exogenous case",
    "there is no clear functional form for the word frequencies before @xmath4 , the relaxation dynamics often is of power law type @xcite , @xmath19 exogenous events  translated into a seismological language  can be identified with the omori law where @xmath20 is interpreted as the analog to the aftershock rate .",
    "the idea is that the frequencies of mentionings of a keyword before ( after ) @xmath4 can be regarded as foreshock ( aftershock ) rates of that particular event . for endogenous events",
    "we also observe foreshocks following an omori law .    for each event in a timeseries of word frequencies in our database",
    "it was checked whether it is endogenous or exogenous . for this we segmented each timeseries ( often containing several events ) into windows of @xmath9 days and located the local maxima within this timespan .. the range of the fit was chosen between @xmath21 with @xmath22 . for each value of @xmath23 in this range",
    "the akaike information criterion was computed .",
    "the exponent of the fit with minimal value of this criterion was used for further analyses . ]",
    "the event was classified as endogenous or exogenous if the residual sum of squares for the fit was below 0.15 , computed by fits to eqs .",
    "( [ endoeq ] ) and ( [ exoeq ] ) around @xmath4 , and normalized by @xmath24 .",
    "with the above procedure we ended up with approximately 150 endogenous and 1000 exogenous events , i.e. an average of @xmath25 endogenous and @xmath26 exogenous events per day . note that exogenous events are about an order of magnitude more frequent .",
    "one media event generally corresponds to events in several word frequencies of related keywords .",
    "this effect should be the same for endogenous and exogenous types .",
    "the gutenberg - richter law is an empirical power law describing the frequency of earthquakes of a given radiated seismic energy @xmath27 , @xmath28 with a typical exponent of @xmath29 @xcite .",
