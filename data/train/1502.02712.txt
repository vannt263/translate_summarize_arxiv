    "the class of stars known in the literature as luminous blue variables(lbvs ) are an important phase in the final evolution of evolved massive stars .",
    "they may represent a short high mass losing stage in which the star sheds much of its outer envelope prior to becoming a wolf - rayet star , or as some authors have suggested , they may be the immediate progenitors of some types of type ii supernovae . a classical lbv or s dor variable in quiescence ( minimum light ) resembles a moderately evolved hot star usually with the spectrum of a b - type supergiant or an of / late wn star @xcite . during an lbv eruption , the mass loss rate increases ,",
    "the wind becomes opaque and cool , and its absorption spectrum resembles an a to f - type supergiant . since this is a shift in the bolometric correction , the star brightens in the visual and appears to move to the right , to lower temperatures on the hr diagram .",
    "this is the lbv s optically thick wind stage or maximum light .",
    "the origin of the instability that leads to this dramatic change is not understood , but most suggestions involve an instability close to the eddington limit .",
    "the mass loss event can last for several years or even decades , and afterwards the star returns to it previous state .",
    "many stars are called lbvs or candidate lbvs , but few are confirmed probably due to the infrequency of the lbv `` eruption '' or maximum light stage .",
    "for example , there are only four confirmed classical or normal lbv / s dor variables in m31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus the discovery of a new lbv in its eruption state is important for understanding their relation to the larger massive star population , the frequency of the lbv eruption , and the duration of this unstable phase .",
    "j004526.62 + 415006.3 was described by @xcite as a  hot lbv candidate \" its normalized spectrum from 2006 ( fig 12 in @xcite ) showed strong h emission lines with p cygni profiles and weak fe ii emission lines . in a survey of luminous stars in m31 and m33",
    ", @xcite noted that its 2010 spectrum closely resembled that of the warm hypergiant j004444.52 + 412804.0 @xcite with prominent p cygni profiles in the multiplet 42 fe ii emission lines , strong hydrogen emission with broad wings and p cygni profiles , and the absorption line spectrum of an early a - type supergiant .",
    "a spectrum from 2011 published by @xcite clearly showed that the fe ii lines had weakened .",
    "they also noted the change from 2006 and suggested that it is an lbv .",
    "a second star j004051.59 + 403303.0 was identified as an lbv candidate .    in this paper",
    "we discuss recent spectra and photometry of j004526.62 + 415006.3 that confirm it is an lbv currently in an optically thick wind state or maximum light .",
    "in addition to the spectrum described in @xcite , it was observed again on 25 and 26 september 2013 with the hectospec multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) @xcite on the 6.5-m mmt on mt .",
    "the hectospec has a 1@xmath1 fov and uses 300 fibers each with a core diameter of 250@xmath2 m subtending 1@xmath35 on the sky .",
    "we used the 600 l / mm grating with the 4800 tilt yielding @xmath4 2500 coverage with 0.54  / pixel resolution and r of @xmath0 2000 .",
    "the same grating with a tilt of 6800 was used for the red spectra with @xmath4 2500 coverage , 0.54 / pixel resolution and r of @xmath0 3600 .",
    "the spectra were reduced using an exportable version of the cfa / sao specroad package for hectospec data .",
    "the spectra were all bias subtracted , flatfielded and wavelength calibrated .",
    "recent broadband ccd photometry was obtained by j. c. martin with the 20-inch telescope at the barber observatory in 2013 and 2014 , and by sholukhova et al.(2014 ) in 2011 .",
    "we also measured additional magnitudes from _ hst_/acs / hrc images observed august 2010 ( hst - go-12056 ) and january 2012 ( hst - go-12106 ) .",
    "the magnitudes are zero pointed to vega and comparable to johnson b and cousins i.    all of the spectroscopic and photometric observations discussed here are summarized in table 1 .",
    "phil massey kindly provided his spectrum from 2006 @xcite reproduced here in figure 1 .",
    "@xcite described j004526.62 + 415006.3 as a  hot lbv candidate \" .",
    "the spectrum is dominated by strong hydrogen emission with broad wings and p cygni profiles and fe ii and [ fe ii ] emission .",
    "some weak absorption lines of he i @xmath54026 , o ii @xmath54070 - 4076 and s iv @xmath5 4116 are visible , suggestive of an early b - type star .    the blue and red spectra from 2010 and 2013 are shown together in figures 2a and 2b , respectively .",
    "they not only illustrate the dramatic change from the hot emission line star in 2006 but also the transition to a cooler temperature from 2010 to 2013 and the formation of the optically thick cool wind in the 2013 spectrum .",
    "@xcite classified its 2010 spectrum as an early a - type supergiant ( a2eia ) . with its strong p cygni profiles in the multiplet 42 fe",
    "ii emission lines they noted its close resemblance to the warm hypergiant j004444.52 + 412804.0 @xcite .",
    "the 2013 spectra show the continued evolution of the wind to cooler temperatures .",
    "metallic absorption lines have replaced the fe ii emission spectrum , strong ca ii h and k lines are conspicuous , and the p cygni profiles are gone except for h@xmath6 .",
    "the blue absorption line spectrum of the optically thick wind is consistent with an early f - type supergiant ( @xmath0 f2 ) . in the red spectrum , the luminosity sensitive o i @xmath57774 triplet and the n i ( multiplet 3 ) absorption lines are much stronger .",
    "the differences between the 2010 and 2013 spectra illustrate the spectroscopic transition and the formation of an optically thick wind typical of lbv / s dor variables .    like other lbvs @xcite",
    ", its spectral energy distribution has a small near - infrared excess due to free - free emission , but it was not detected in the irac survey of m31 @xcite or the wise source catalog .",
    "so it apparently does not have a near- or mid - infrared excess due to dust ( see figure 11 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , the relative strengths of the [ n ii ] @xmath55755 and @xmath56584 emission lines compared to the [ s ii ] lines in the 2010 spectrum indicate the presence of a relatively dense circumstellar nebula , much denser than expected for an h ii region @xcite .",
    "the outflow velocities from the stellar wind measured from the absorption minima in the p cygni profiles in these spectra are summarized in table 3 .",
    "lbvs not only have slow wind velocities during their maximum light , dense wind state , but during their quiescent hot state their winds are also slower than those measured the same way in normal supergiants of similar spectral type @xcite .",
    "j004526.62 + 415006.3 shows the same pattern , although the outflow measured in the 2010 spectrum is interestingly higher when the star was in transition to the dense wind state .",
    "the light curve is shown in figure 3 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have either spectra or photometry between 2006 and 2010 to determine the onset of the lbv / s dor eruption . however ,",
    "our spectra demonstrate that the star was in transition to its cool dense wind state in 2010 , so the outburst probably began in 2010 or shortly before that .",
    "based on the photometry from 1999 - 2003 to 2012 - 2014 , @xmath7v is surprisingly , at most , only 0.9 mag which is too small for the implied change in apparent temperature between the 2006 and 20102013 spectra .",
    "thus we suspect that the earlier photometry is not representative of its minimum light or quiescent state , and it may have been in an elevated state at that time .",
    "previous photometry also shows that it has had other eruptions ; it was measured at v = 16.3 in 1992 @xcite .",
    "adopting the interstellar extinction , a@xmath8 = 1.5 mag from @xcite , measured from three different indicators , its visual luminosity at maximum light is m@xmath8 -9.65 with a distance modulus of 24.4 mag for m31 @xcite . at maximum light , the bolometric correction will be quite small , corresponding to the early f - type spectrum of the dense wind .",
    "m@xmath9 is therefore also @xmath4 -9.65 mag .",
    "the corresponding parameters for the star in its quiescent or hot state are less well determined , but its spectrum from 2006 suggests an early b type supergiant with a surface temperature on the order of 20,000 k or hotter . on the hr diagram , j004526.62 + 415006.3 will thus lie very close to ae and in m31 , var c in m33 , and the well studied progenitor of the class s dor , see figure 12 in @xcite .    given the lack of photometric data between 2000 and 2010 , any additional data from that period or earlier would be appreciated to better define the properties of the progenitor and the onset of the current eruption , as well as future photometric and spectroscopic monitoring .",
    "we are especially grateful to phil massey for sharing his spectrum of j004526.62 + 415006.3 from 2006 and to olga sholukova and her collaborators for a preprint of their paper .",
