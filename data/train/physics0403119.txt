    "condensation of a dusty plasma @xcite into a crystalline state was proposed by ikezi in 1986 @xcite and demonstrated experimentally eight years later by a number of research groups @xcite . the subject has been reviewed by morfill et al .",
    "@xcite and most recently an experiment to test dusty plasma physics has been set up on the international space station @xcite .",
    "the original model @xcite for this process was motivated by monte - carlo calculations @xcite which predicted that a coulomb crystal would form when the coulomb interaction energy between two adjacent charged particles in a one - component - plasma exceeded their thermal energy by some factor .",
    "the coulomb interaction energy for charged particles with density @xmath0is the electrostatic energy of one particle in the potential of an adjacent particle located at the wigner - seitz interparticle separation distance @xcite@xmath1 according to the monte - carlo calculations , condensation of charged particles into a crystal should occur when @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the charge on each particle and @xmath4 is the temperature of the particles . as noted by ikezi @xcite ,  eq.([gamma ] ) could be a very poor estimate for dusty plasmas ( which are a three - component - plasma ) , but lacking a better model , eq.([gamma ] ) has often been used as a benchmark for dusty plasma crystallization experiments .",
    "the experiments show @xcite that the actual value of @xmath5 required for condensation is two to three orders of magnitude larger than that predicted by eq.([gamma ] ) .",
    "thus , while ikezi s original postulate that dusty plasmas can condense into crystals has been experimentally validated , there has not been a quantitative model predicting the value of @xmath5 necessary for condensation to occur .",
    "interactions between adjacent particles in a plasma are intimately related to the concept of debye shielding . according to this concept ,",
    "any plasma particle can be considered to be a test particle surrounded by a screening cloud of adjacent particles .",
    "the screening completely cancels the test particle field at distances much greater than the debye length .",
    "screening may be accomplished by adjacent particles of either the same polarity as the test charge or opposite polarity , but is subject to the constraint that the test particle can not be moving faster than the thermal velocity of the shielding particles @xcite .",
    "for example , if the test particle is an electron , it is shielded by the repulsion of other electrons in the presence of a uniform neutralizing ion background , but it is not shielded by ions because it is moving too fast for ions to respond . on the other hand ,",
    "ions are shielded by both electrons and ions . in a dusty plasma",
    "one might thus reasonably expect dust grains to be shielded by electrons , ions , and other dust grains .    the standard model of debye shielding is based on the boltzmann relation , an equilibrium solution to the fluid equation of motion for each species @xmath6 such that the force due to the electric field balances the force due to the gradient of an isotropic scalar pressure , i.e.,@xmath7 three critical assumptions are intrinsic to the standard model of debye shielding , namely : ( i )  it is assumed that the plasma is sufficiently collisional that the concept of an isotropic scalar pressure @xmath8 @xmath9 is valid , ( ii )  it is assumed that a boltzmann dependence @xmath10 exists relating the local density @xmath11 to the system - averaged density @xmath12 , and ( iii ) it is assumed that @xmath13so that the boltzmann relationship may be linearized giving @xmath14 .",
    "the standard model for debye shielding of a test particle with charge @xmath15 results when the linearized boltzmann relationships of the various species are substituted into poisson s equation giving the yukawa - type solution @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 the summation in eq.([debye sum ] ) is restricted to species that participate in the shielding and so excludes all species having thermal velocity slower than the species of the test particle .    when @xmath19the yukawa solution diverges , violating assumption ( iii)@xmath20 that @xmath21 and causing the standard model to fail to be internally self - consistent .",
    "this failure of the standard model of debye shielding has been noted previously , e.g. , see lampe , joyce and ganguli @xcite for criticism regarding assumptions ( i)-(iii ) . in addition , hansen and fajans @xcite have shown that trapping can affect debye shielding in a pure electron plasma while goree @xcite , zobnin et al .",
    "@xcite , and lampe et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that trapping of ions can affect shielding of a dust grain .",
    "the issue of how to treat debye shielding when @xmath22 is especially critical for the dust condensation problem , because @xmath23 is essentially the same as @xmath5 .",
    "consensus does not exist on how to address this issue .",
    "furthermore , the form of eq.([debye sum ] ) is such that the sum on the right hand side is dominated by the term having the smallest @xmath24 and , since dust particles are both cold and highly charged , the dust debye length is typically much smaller than both the electron and ion debye lengths .",
    "one might expect that the system debye length @xmath25 should be very nearly the dust debye length @xmath26 , but this point of view has usually been rejected .",
    "the dust debye length @xmath26 is typically so small that it is less than @xmath27 , and questions have been raised as to whether such a short shielding length has physical significance since the standard debye argument is based on the implicit assumption that there is a statistically large number of particles in a sphere having the debye radius .",
    "this is clearly not true for dust particles in a sphere with radius @xmath26 if @xmath26 is less than @xmath28 nevertheless , wang and bhattarcharjee @xcite and also otani and bhattarcharjee @xcite argued that some sort of shielding does occur at the scale of @xmath26 but the only support for this point of view was demonstration @xcite of some time - averaged correlation effects at the scale of @xmath26 in a one - dimensional numerical simulation that would only crystallize if artificially annealed .",
    "most other authors ignore dust self - shielding on the presumption that the debye shielding concept does not make sense when a debye length is smaller than @xmath28    we present here a model for a dusty plasma on the verge of condensation .",
    "this model takes into account both collisional and collisionless behavior in three dimensional geometry , avoids inappropriate use of fluid theory , shows that the dust debye length has important physical significance even though it is much smaller than @xmath29 and predicts a condensation threshold in good agreement with experimental measurements .",
    "the derivation identifies four physically distinct concentric regions surrounding a test charge .",
    "the ions are collisionless in the innermost three regions but collisional in the outer , fourth region ( the collisionless nature of ions in the inner three regions is consistent with the assumptions inherent in dust grain charging theory ) .",
    "the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to locate the two interfaces between the first three regions and knowledge of these interface locations is then used to give the criterion for condensation .",
    "the @xmath30 temperature regime of typical dusty plasma condensation experiments is assumed @xmath20 and ions are assumed to be singly charged ( the theory could be extended to arbitrary temperatures without great difficulty , but this would unnecessarily complicate the model ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  section ii reviews relevant aspects of dust charging theory and sets up a dimensionless parameter space suitable for comparing the model to experiments .",
    "section iii uses collisionless vlasov theory to calculate the ion , electron , and dust grain densities and shows that when @xmath31 , the ion density differs from the boltzmann model ; this difference demonstrates the inappropriateness of fluid models in this regime and resolves the paradox associated with divergence of the yukawa solution at small @xmath32 section iv  shows that the vicinity of a test particle can be divided into three concentric spherical regions each having distinct physics determined by the magnitude of @xmath33 .",
    "section v  derives approximate solutions to the vlasov - poisson system for these three regions and section vi derives matching conditions across the two interfaces between the three regions . section vii uses the matching conditions to deduce a condition for dust condensation and compares the model predictions with experiments .",
    "section viii provides a summary and discussion .",
    "two independent parameters characterize the dust grains in a dusty plasma :  the grain radius @xmath34 and the wigner - seitz radius @xmath28 in order to develop a model based on dimensionless parameters , the ion debye length @xmath35 will be used as the ` yardstick ' by which all lengths are measured .",
    "a bar will be used to denote lengths normalized to the ion debye length so that the normalized wigner - seitz radius , for example , is@xmath36 the two quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 constitute the coordinates for a dimensionless dusty plasma parameter space .    in order to  avoid confusing minus signs ,",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath39 will be replaced by the positive dimensionless variable @xmath40 and @xmath41 will denote the potential on the surface of a dust grain .",
    "thus , positive @xmath42 attracts ions but repels both electrons and dust grains .    when dust grains are placed in an electron - ion plasma ,",
    "some fraction of the electrons attach to the dust grain surface , causing the dust grains to become negatively charged and reducing the density of free electrons . the quantitative theory of",
    "dust charging , summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , combines collisionless vlasov theory with an analysis of trajectories of individual particles as they approach a finite radius charged sphere .",
    "the particle trajectories are assumed to be governed by orbital - motion - limited ( oml ) theory @xcite wherein particle trajectories are assumed to be collisionless and completely determined by considerations of conservation of angular momentum and conservation of energy",
    ". there has been some question @xcite about the extent to which the standard dust charging model applies to dust grains in an electrode sheath , the typical situation for terrestrial dusty plasma condensation experiments , but not for the zero - gravity dusty plasma condensation experiment on the international space station .",
    "we assume in this paper that the standard dust charging model is applicable so that the effect , if any , of electrode sheaths on dust charging is small .    the standard dust",
    "charging model shows that dust grain charging is governed by the dimensionless parameter@xmath43 where @xmath44 has the functional dependence@xmath45    global quasineutrality gives @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of electrons captured by a dust grain .",
    "we define the electron capture factor@xmath48 so that @xmath49 corresponds to having all the electrons attached to the dust grains while @xmath50 corresponds to having no electrons attached to the dust grains .",
    "the quasineutrality condition , eq . ( [ qn ] ) , can thus be expressed as@xmath51 and dust charging theory @xcite shows that @xmath52 since @xmath41 and @xmath53 are functions of @xmath54 they have functional dependence @xmath55 and @xmath56    combining eqs .",

    "this result is actually slightly incorrect for a shielded dust grain , because , as shown in the next paragraph , the shielding cloud surrounding a dust grain depresses the potential at the grain surface to a value below the value given by eq.([zd ] ) .    to understand this potential depression effect due to shielding , consider the potential @xmath39 on the surface of a sphere with charge @xmath61 and radius @xmath62 surrounded by a shell of shielding charge @xmath63 at radius @xmath64 the potential on the surface of the shielded sphere",
    "is given by @xmath65 a result obtained by taking into account the contributions to @xmath66 from both the sphere and its shielding charge .",
    "the ratio of the surface potential of the shielded sphere to the potential of an identical unshielded sphere is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the surface potential of the unshielded sphere . if @xmath69 where @xmath25 is the nominal debye length , then @xmath70 so the potential of the shielded sphere will be greatly depressed from its vacuum value if @xmath71 this indicates that being highly charged is insufficient for a dust grain to have a large potential ;  it also needs to have @xmath72 the model of dust charging thus has the implicit assumption that @xmath38 is small compared to unity and this assumption will be made in the remainder of this paper",

    "@xcite , a typical dust crystallization experiment . since dust grains in a given experiment have a fixed ratio @xmath76 a specific experiment is characterized by a sloping straight line in @xmath77 parameter space .",
    "moving up and to the right along such a line corresponds to making @xmath78 smaller whereas moving down and to the left corresponds to making @xmath78 larger .",
    "densities in an experiment are typically measured by  langmuir probes which have an uncertainty of -50% , + 100% , so that the density of @xmath79 @xmath80 reported in @xcite would actually be in the range @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 this factor of four range of densities @xcite corresponds to the straight line segment labeled ` expt ' in figs.1(a)-(c ) .",

    "a typical dust grain will be considered as a test particle inserted in a plasma consisting of electrons , ions , and other dust grains .",
    "the origin of a spherical coordinate system will be defined to be at the center of this test particle .",
    "typical dust condensation experiments have neutral pressures @xmath87 pa ( corresponding to a neutral density @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath20@xmath80 ) .",
    "since neutral cross - sections are @xmath90 @xmath91 , the mean free path for ion - neutral collisions is @xmath92 mm@xmath93 which is at least an order of magnitude larger than shielding scale lengths .",
    "the last collision experienced by an ion in the vicinity of the test particle will have occurred outside a sphere having a normalized diameter of the order of @xmath94 ; such a sphere is shown schematically in fig . 2 and lies at the interface between regions 3 and 4 . thus ions can be considered collisionless inside regions 1 to 3 and collisional in region 4 ; the details of regions 1 to 3 will be discussed later .",
    "this separation of space into collisional and collisionless regions is similar to the arguments used in dust grain charging theory ( the oml assumption underlying dust grain charging theory is based on angular momentum conservation which can only be true if a particle has no collisions ) .",

    "collisions @xmath20make the distribution function maxwellian in region 4 and this provides a boundary condition for the collisionless distribution function in regions 1 to 3 .",
    "the distribution function in regions 1 to 3 must satisfy the collisionless vlasov equation and so must be must be a function of constants of the motion @xcite .",
    "the relevant constant of the motion here is the particle energy @xmath96 , and so the distribution function in regions 1 to 3 is @xmath97 this is the right choice because @xmath98 is not only a function of a constant of the motion @xmath99 but also joins smoothly to the region 4  maxwellian solution where @xmath95 and the plasma is collisional .    electrons and dust grains experience a repulsive force upon approaching the negatively charged dust grain test particle and so are slowed down with some particles being slowed down to zero velocity and reflecting .",
    "thus , electrons or dust grains near the dust grain test particle can have zero velocity . the respective electron and dust grain densities in the vicinity of the dust grain test particle are thus given by @xmath100 using eq.([psi defn ] ) , the electron and dust grain densities normalized to their average values are@xmath101 and@xmath102 these densities are identical to the boltzmann relation and so demonstrate that collisionless kinetic theory agrees with fluid theory for negatively charged particles near a negatively charged test particle .",
    "ion behavior is fundamentally different because ions , being positive , are accelerated as they approach the negatively charged dust grain test particle ; this means that there are no zero velocity ions near a dust grain .",
    "the slowest ion is one that has fallen into the negative @xmath39 well with zero initial velocity at the edge of the well and the velocity of such an ion will satisfy @xmath103 using eq.([psi defn ] ) it is seen that this minimum possible ion velocity can be expressed as @xmath104    evaluation of the ion density in the vicinity of the dust grain test particle therefore requires invoking a lower limit at @xmath105 for the velocity integration over the distribution function",

    "equation ( [ inner ion ] ) thus demonstrates a failure of fluid theory and its associated boltzmann relationship when @xmath116 .",
    "this failure occurs because the concept of ion pressure no longer makes sense when @xmath116 .",
    "the pressure concept is based on the assumption that particles have an isotropic gaussian distribution of random velocities about some mean velocity whereas when @xmath119 ions in reality are falling into a deep potential well and do not have a random distribution of velocities about some mean velocity .",
    "equation ( [ ni ] ) and the distinction between its small and large @xmath42 limits have been previously discussed by laframboise and parker @xcite in the context of electrostatic probes and by lampe , joyce and ganguli @xcite in the context of dusty plasmas .",
    "the lower limit of the integral in eq.([ni calc ] ) causes the ion distribution to have an @xmath120 phase - space ` hole ' in the vicinity of the dust grain since @xmath121 for velocities below @xmath105 .",
    "it has been argued by bernstein and rabinowitz @xcite , laframboise and parker @xcite , and lampe @xcite that for a certain class of radial potential profiles , another sort of phase - space hole can also exist .",
    "this additional hole results from a rather subtle barrier that can occur because for a certain range of the angular momentum @xmath122 the effective potential @xmath123 can have a small local maximum .",
    "this barrier prevents access to small @xmath124 by particles having a certain range of @xmath99 and @xmath122 .",
    "if such a barrier exists , the radial ion density profile will differ somewhat from the predictions of oml  theory , because the ions that can not pass by this barrier will have a radial turning point at a larger radius than predicted by oml .",
    "however , since poisson s equation shows that @xmath42 is essentially a double integral of the net charge density up to a radius @xmath125 changes in the turning point of small classes of ions should not have a major effect on the @xmath42 profile , i.e. , small corrections to the oml  model should not result in a significant collective effect .",
    "lampe @xcite has shown that the error introduced by omission of consideration of these centrifugal force barriers is very small for dusty plasmas and so we will ignore this correction to oml  theory .",
    "another correction to oml theory results from consideration of ion capture by the dust grain which also causes a hole in phase - space @xcite . as shown in ref.@xcite capture of ions by the dust grain reduces the number of ions moving radially outward from the dust grain in comparison to the limiting situation where the dust grain does not capture any ions so that all ions are perfectly reflected from the dust grain . taking into account",
    "the reduction in the number of outward moving ions compared to inward moving ions would require replacing the distribution function prescribed by eq.([f soln ] ) by a distribution function of the form @xcite @xmath126 where  @xmath127 is the phase space density of ions moving radially outwards from the dust grain and @xmath128 is the phase space density of ions moving radially inwards .",
    "if ions are perfectly reflected at the dust grain then @xmath129  in which case eq.([f soln ] ) is appropriate , but if ions are captured by the dust grain then @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 and a more complicated prescription than eq.([f soln ] ) would have to be used .",
    "we will assume that the fraction of ions incident at @xmath133 which are captured by the dust grain is so small that eq.([f soln ] ) is a reasonably accurate prescription for the ion phase space density .",
    "we are thus assuming that the @xmath124 projection of ion motion has a reflecting trajectory so that there are equal numbers of ions moving radially inwards and outwards in the dust grain shielding cloud .",
    "this assumption will be validated later .",
    "finally , we will also ignore ion trapping @xcite , but will later make some brief comments about the extent to which trapping might be important .",
    "poisson s equation @xmath134 relates the densities of the various species to the electrostatic potential . assuming spherical symmetry about the dust grain test particle and using eq.([psi defn ] ) , poisson s equation can be recast as@xmath135 using eqs.([ne ] ) , ( [ nd ] ) , ( [ ni ] ) for the normalized densities and also eq.([define alpha ] ) , the normalized vlasov / poisson system becomes@xmath136 where @xmath137 is presumed to be large compared to unity since the dust grain is highly charged and @xmath138 equation ( [ grand pe ] ) is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation for @xmath42 and is consistent with the collisionless vlasov equation .",
    "since the densities were obtained using the collisionless vlasov equation , this system will be called the vlasov / poisson system to distinguish it from the fluid / poisson system .",
    "we now argue that three distinct regions exist for @xmath42 such that in each region the vlasov / poisson system has a different form .",
    "the location of these regions is sketched in fig.2 and , going outwards from the surface of the dust grain test particle , these regions and their interfaces are defined by :    region 1 is where @xmath139 @xmath140 and exists because the grain potential @xmath41 is large compared to unity [ see fig.1(a ) ] .",
    "region 1 is a sheath - like inner region where the ion density has the non - boltzmann behavior given by eq.([inner ion ] ) .",
    "region 2 is where @xmath141 and is depleted of dust grains . shielding in this region is provided mainly by ions .",
    "region 3 is where @xmath142 and this region extends to region 4 where collisions set in and where the potential goes to zero . shielding in region 3 is done mainly by dust grains and this shielding takes place over a very short characteristic length , causing an extremely sharp cut - off of the potential .",
    "the radii of the respective interfaces between regions 1 and 2 and between regions 2 and 3 will be called @xmath143 and @xmath133 as indicated in fig.2 ( the subscripts @xmath144and @xmath145 stand for inner and outer interfaces ) .",
    "the values of @xmath143 and @xmath133 will be unknowns to be solved for ; determining these radii is the crux of the problem .",
    "the three collisionless regions will now be discussed going from the outermost ( region 3 ) to the innermost ( region 1 ) .      in region 3 , eq.([grand pe ] ) can be approximated as@xmath147 using @xmath20 @xmath148 this has the yukawa - type solution @xmath149    the coefficient in eq.([small psi soln ] ) has been chosen so that @xmath150 at @xmath151 the effective shielding length in region 3 is the dust debye length@xmath152 which is much smaller than the ion debye length since @xmath53 is of order unity [ see fig.1(b ) ] and @xmath153      the @xmath155 term is dropped from eq.([grand pe ] ) in region 2 because @xmath156 is large .",

    "examination of the parametric sensitivity of the model predictions shows that intersection of the hayashi / tachibana experiment with the predicted condensation curve occurs if the assumed electron temperature is increased to @xmath253 ev or if the assumed grain diameter is doubled . increasing the assumed atomic mass number to values larger than 16",
    "also causes the experiment curve to approach the condensation curve but this effect is minimal in the relevant parameter range .",
    "reference @xcite reported an ion temperature which was not measured , but assumed , and an electron temperature which was estimated based on earlier measurements @xcite made in another plasma under similar conditions .",
    "it is possible therefore that the slight discrepancy between the model predictions and the hayashi / tachibana experiment results from an inaccurate estimation of the electron to ion temperature ratio in the region of the dust grains .",
    "better agreement would be obtained with a higher @xmath254 ratio and the values of @xmath255 and @xmath246 used in table i were chosen to correspond to room temperature ions and the electron temperature measurement given in fig.4 of ref.@xcite .",
    "comparison with a scanning electron microscope measurement has shown that the mie scattering technique used by hayashi / tachibana to measure the dust grain diameter is quite accurate @xcite , so it is unlikely that the discrepancy between the model predictions and the hayashi / tachibana experiment is due to a factor of two error in measurement of the dust grain diameter .",
    "another question to be addressed is the  possible importance of ( i )  barriers due to local maxima in the effective potential @xcite and ( ii ) ion trapping / detrapping due to collisions@xcite .",
    "the model presented here argues that the amount of net charge in region 1 is so small that the potential in region 1 is nearly the same as the vacuum potential that would be produced by a bare , unshielded dust grain [ see eq.([psi - homo ] ) ] . changing",
    "the amount of charge in region 1 by factors as large as order unity would not affect this argument .",
    "thus any reduction in the amount of charge in region 1 because of effective potential barriers will make no difference to the region 1 solution , because it is already assumed that there is no charge in region 1 .",
    "so long as the number of trapped ions in region 1 is small compared to @xmath256 the potential in region 1 is mainly due to the dust charge and again it is reasonable to use the vacuum potential in region 1 . as for region 2 ,",
    "the ion density predicted by collisionless theory in region 2 is identical to the linearized boltzmann relation obtained from collisional theory [ see eq.([pe region2 ] ) ] . since trapping and detrapping result from collisions , trapping and detrapping should tend to make the system more boltzmann - like , but",
    "since the system is already boltzmann - like in region 2 , trapping and detrapping should not cause significant changes to the region 2 ion density profile and thus should not significantly affect the @xmath42 profile in region 2 .",
    "effective potential barriers in region 2 may rearrange the radial charge distribution in region 2 slightly , but this should cause only a small effect on @xmath42 because @xmath42 is a double integral with respect to radius of the net charge distribution [ see eq.([poisson norm ] ) ] . as for region 3 ,",
    "the normalized potential @xmath42 is so small in region 3 @xmath20that ions are unaffected by any spatial dependence of the potential ; any corrections to the region 3 potential profile should therefore have negligible effect on ion trajectories .",
    "thus , while effective potential barriers and trapping / detrapping may modify the net charge radial profile somewhat , these should have a much reduced effect on the @xmath42 profile and so should not cause any substantial changes in the values of @xmath143 or @xmath213 small changes in the @xmath42 profile should not affect the basic premise that there exist three concentric collisionless regions each with distinct physics nor  the conclusion that dust grains condense when the radius @xmath133 of the interface between regions 2 and 3 exceeds @xmath257 the nominal intergrain spacing distance .    at this point in the discussion it is possible to revisit the assumption made at the end of section iii that ion capture by dust grains",
    "may be ignored when characterizing the collisionless ion velocity distribution function in regions 1 - 3 . ignoring ion capture by the dust grain",
    "is tantamount to saying that all ions entering the collisionless region are reflected radially so that there are equal numbers of ions moving radially inward and outwards ; if some ions were captured by the dust grain , there would be fewer ions moving radially outwards than inwards .",
    "the number of captured ions can be estimated using oml  theory @xcite which shows that the effective cross - section for ions entering from a radius where the potential is zero and then being captured by a dust grain is @xmath258 .",
    "this capture cross - section is to be compared to @xmath259 the cross - section for ions to enter region 2 from outside ( the outer boundary of region 2 is used because this denotes the edge of the potential well seen by the ions ) .",
    "of  the ions that enter region 2 , the fraction that are captured by the dust grain is given by the ratio @xmath260 @xmath261 .",
    "evaluation of this ratio using the chu and i parameters in table i ( @xmath262 @xmath263 @xmath264 ) gives @xmath265 which shows that the fraction of ions captured is small enough to be neglected ( similar results hold for the other experiments listed in table i ) .",
    "this validates the assumption made in section iii that distinctions  @xcite between the outward and inward ion velocity distributions @xmath266 @xmath132 may be neglected and confirms that eq.([f soln ] ) is a suitable representation for the ion distribution function .",
    "the standard linear fluid analysis of debye shielding fails  when @xmath267 exceeds unity because the linear debye shielding model is based on the assumption that @xmath268 is small compared to unity .",
    "this issue is important for condensation of dusty plasmas , because condensation requires having @xmath269 exceed unity .",
    "dusty plasmas can be characterized by an @xmath257 @xmath38 parameter space where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the inter - grain spacing distance and grain radius normalized to the ion debye length .",
    "an experiment corresponds to a point in this parameter space and if the density of the experiment is not known precisely , then the range of densities within experimental error corresponds to a slanted line segment in this parameter space .    because shielding distances are much smaller than an ion collision mean free path , ions can be considered as collisionless in the shielding sphere surrounding a dust grain .",
    "a collisionless vlasov model is used to calculate particle densities in the electrostatic potential of a dust grain test charge .",
    "this collisionless theory gives the same results as does boltzmann theory for electrons and for dust grains because they are negatively charged but gives results different from boltzmann theory for ions in the vicinity of the dust grain .",
    "ions near a highly charged dust grain test particle fall into a deep potential well and are accelerated to high velocities .",
    "this means that no ions have zero velocity near the dust grain test particle and so integrals over the velocity distribution have a lower velocity limit corresponding to the minimum velocity of an ion falling into the deep potential well .",
    "this invalidates the fluid theory concept of pressure because pressure is based on the assumption of the existence of random velocities about some mean . for @xmath270",
    "the ion density corresponds to the boltzmann prediction , but for @xmath271 the ion density is much less than that predicted by the boltzmann relation .",
    "the potential in the vicinity of a dust grain test particle has three distinct types of behavior .",
    "these behaviors occur in concentric spherical regions consisting of ( 1 )  an inner region where the potential is vacuum - like , ( 2 )  a middle region where the potential includes both growing and decaying yukawa - like terms with characteristic scale lengths of the order of the ion debye length , and ( 3 )  an outer region with a rapidly decaying yukawa - type solution having a scale length of the order of the dust debye length .",
    "region 1 physics differs from fluid theory , is consistent with dust charging physics , and avoids the paradoxes intrinsic to fluid theory at large @xmath272 .    for any point @xmath257 @xmath38 in dusty plasma parameter space ,",
    "the requirement for smooth matching of the solutions at the interfaces between the three inner regions determines the locations @xmath143 and @xmath273of these interfaces .",
    "condensation occurs when @xmath274 and occurs on the line @xmath275 which gives a ` condensation curve ' in dusty plasma parameter space ; @xmath276 is less than @xmath133 above this curve and in this region the dusty plasma is crystallized .",
