    "a principal insight into schrdinger theory arrived at is that the schrdinger equation can be written in self - consistent form . to explain what we mean , consider first the stationary - state case .",
    "it is proved via the ` quantal newtonian ' first law , that the hamiltonian @xmath5 for the system of electrons in a static electromagnetic field is a functional of the wave function @xmath6 , _",

    "other understandings achieved show that the scalar potential energy of an electron @xmath17 is the work done in a conservative field @xmath18 .",

    "the constituent property - related components of the potential @xmath17 are thus known .",
    "the components of the field @xmath19 are expectation values of hermitian operators taken with respect to the wave function @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the potential @xmath2 , ( and hence the hamiltonian ) , is a known functional of the wave function .",
    "finally , the presence of the lorentz field in the expression for @xmath17 , admits a term involving the magnetic field @xmath20 in the schrdinger equation as written in self - consistent form .",
    "these insights all lead to a fundamentally different way of thinking of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the new physics is explicated for the stationary - state case by application to the ground and first excited singlet state of a two - dimensional quantum dot in a magnetostatic field . for the time - dependent case ,",

    ", are simply the time - independent functions shifted in time .",
    "in conclusion , we have arrived at new insights into the schrdinger theory of electrons in electromagnetic fields via the ` quantal newtonian ' first and second laws for each electron .",
    "a principal understanding is that the scalar potential energy of an electron @xmath161 is a known functional of the wave function @xmath162 .",
    "as such the hamiltonian @xmath163 is a functional of the wave function : @xmath164/\\hat{h } [ \\psi ( { \\bf{x } } ) t ] \\}$ ] .",
    "thus the schrdinger equation can now be thought of as one whose solution can be obtained self - consistently . a path for the determination of the exact wave function is thus formulated . such a path is feasible given the advent of present - day high computing power .",
    "a second understanding achieved is that it is now possible to write the scalar potential @xmath165 $ ] as the sum of component functions each of which is representative of a specific property of the system such as the correlations due to the pauli exclusion principle and coulomb repulsion , kinetic and magnetic effects , and the electron density .",
    "such a property - related division of the scalar potential is shown by the example of the quantum dot in a magnetostatic field given in the text .",
    "another interesting observation is that in its self - consistent form , in addition to the vector potential , which appears in the schrdinger equation as a consequence of the correspondence principle , the magnetic field now too appears in the equation because of the ` quantal newtonian ' laws . _",
    "ex post facto _ , we now understand that this must be the case as the hamiltonian itself is being determined self - consistently .",
    "it is interesting to compare the self - consistent method for the determination of the wave function in the stationary ground state case to that of the variational method .",
    "the latter is associated principally with the property of the total energy .",
    "an approximate parametrized variational wave function correct to @xmath166 leads to an upper bound for the energy that is correct to @xmath167 .",
    "such a wave function is accurate in the region where the principal contribution to the energy arises .",
    "however , all other observables obtained as the expectation of hermitian single- and two - particle operators are correct only to the same order as that of the wave function , _",
    "viz_. to @xmath166 .",
    "a better approximate variational wave function is one that leads to a lower value of the energy .",
    "there is no guarantee that other observables representative of different regions of configuration space are thereby more accurate . on the other hand ,",
    "in the self - consistent procedure , achieved say to a desired accuracy of five decimal places , _ all _ the properties are correct to the same degree of accuracy .",
    "an improved wave function would be one correct to a greater decimal accuracy .",
    "as a point of note , the constrained - search variational method @xcite expands the variational space of approximate parametrized wave functions by considering the wave function @xmath6 to be a functional of a function @xmath168 , _ i.e. _ @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "one searches over all functions @xmath168 such that the wave function @xmath170 $ ] is normalized , gives the exact ( theoretical or experimental ) value of an observable , while leading to a rigorous upper bound to the energy . in this manner ,",
    "the wave function functional @xmath170 $ ] is accurate not only in the region contributing to the energy , but also that of the observable .",
    "the self - consistent solution of the schrdinger equation , however , is accurate to the degree required , throughout configuration space .",
    "we do not address here the broader procedural aspects of the self - consistency , nor the implications of the explicit presence of the magnetic field in it .",
