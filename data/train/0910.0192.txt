    "the techniques based on the factorization method , which try to identify the class of hamiltonians whose spectral problem can be algebraically solved , have attracted for years people s attention . in these lecture notes",
    "we will elaborate a brief survey of this subject ; since we shall show that the factorization method , supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) , and intertwining technique are equivalent procedures for generating new solvable potentials departing from an initial one , these names will be indistinctly used to characterize the technique we are interested in . for a collection of books and review articles concerning factorization method and related subjects the reader can seek @xcite-@xcite .",
    "i would like to emphasize that these lecture notes on susy qm are a sequel of those delivered by myself in 2004 at the latin - american school of physics @xcite .",
    "for people wanting to have a global view of the way our group addresses the subject , and to know more details of our achievements , i recommend to read both , this article and @xcite , because they complement to each other .    from a historical viewpoint",
    ", it is nowadays accepted that the factorization method was introduced for the first time by dirac in 1935 in order to derive algebraically the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator @xcite . in coordinates",
    "such that @xmath0 the oscillator hamiltonian admits the following factorizations : @xmath1 from these equations it is straightforward to derive the intertwining relationships , @xmath2 which lead to the commutators ruling the standard heisenberg - weyl algebra : @xmath3 = - a , \\quad [ h , a^+ ] = a^+ , \\quad [ a , a^+ ] = 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these expressions and the fact that @xmath4 is positive definite allow to generate the eigenfunctions @xmath5 and corresponding eigenvalues @xmath6 of @xmath4 .",
    "the second important advance in the subject was done by schrdinger in 1940 , who realized that the factorization method can be as well applied to the radial part of the coulomb problem @xcite . in this case",
    "the explicit factorizations in appropriate units read : @xmath7 as in the previous case , these factorizations imply some intertwining relationships : @xmath8 from which it can be derived once again the radial eigenfunctions @xmath9 and eigenvalues @xmath10 for the hamiltonian @xmath11 .    in a set of works starting from 1941 , infeld and collaborators put forward the method @xcite , culminating their research with a seminal paper in which it was classified a wide set of schrdinger - type hamiltonians ( indeed four families ) solvable through the factorization method @xcite . the main tool for performing this classification",
    "were the factorizations @xmath12 , \\quad a_m^+ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ - \\frac{d}{dx } + \\beta_m(x)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which lead straightforwardly to the intertwining relationships @xmath13 with these ingredients , infeld and hull were able to derive elegantly the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the hierarchy of hamiltonians @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the very technique allowed them to determine the several forms of the potentials @xmath15 admitting the factorization treatment . in this way , after @xcite the idea that the factorization methods was exhausted started to dominate ; indeed , at some time it was thought that for a potential @xmath16 to be solvable through factorization , it just has to appear in the infeld - hull classification .",
    "revealing himself against this idea , in 1984 mielnik performed a simple generalization of the factorization method @xcite .",
    "he proposed to look for the most general first - order differential operators @xmath17 factorizing the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian in the way : @xmath18 , \\quad b^+ = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left [ -\\frac{d}{dx } + \\beta(x ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] mielnik was able to determine the most general form of @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the product @xmath20 supplies a new hamiltonian @xmath21 hence , the following intertwining relationships are valid : @xmath22 which interrelate the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath4 with those of @xmath23 and vice versa .",
    "mielnik s work was a breakthrough in the development of the factorization method , since it opened new ways to explore exactly solvable potentials in quantum mechanics .",
    "in particular , his generalization was quickly applied to the radial part of the coulomb problem @xcite .",
    "the important resultant expressions for that system become : @xmath24 they allow to generate the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath25 departing from those of @xmath11 .",
    "notice that , in the same year the connections between the factorization method with the darboux transformation and witten s supersymmetric quantum mechanics were established by andrianov et al @xcite and nieto @xcite respectively .    in 1985",
    "sukumar @xcite pushed further mielnik s factorization by applying it to general one - dimensional potentials @xmath16 and arbitrary factorization energies @xmath26 in the way @xmath27 , \\",

    ", several particular cases and applications of the generalized factorization of @xcite have been performed successfully @xcite-@xcite . up to this point , however , the factorization operators , becoming the intertwiners in the equivalent formalism , were differential operators of first order .",
    "a natural generalization , posed in 1993 by andrianov and collaborators @xcite , requires that eq.([intertwining ] ) be valid but @xmath29 are substituted by differential operators of order greater than one . through this higher - order case ,",
    "it is possible to surpass the restriction arising from the first - order method that we can only modify the ground state energy of the initial hamiltonian . in 1995",
    "bagrov and samsonov proposed the same generalization , and they offered an alternative view to this issue @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", our group arrived to the subject in 1997 @xcite-@xcite , although there were several previous works related somehow to this generalization @xcite-@xcite .",
