    "qcd sum rules @xcite represent one approach towards understanding the masses of hadrons .",
    "hadronic parameters , among them the masses , are linked to expectation values of qcd operators , the condensates .",
    "the nonzero values of condensates point to a complicated structure of the qcd vacuum , i.e. , of the ground state of strong interaction .",
    "there are a few particularly important condensates : ( i ) the chiral condensate , @xmath2 , is connected with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "together with the explicit chiral symmetry breaking by nonzero quark masses @xmath3 , the pion mass @xmath4 is related via the gell  mann - oakes - renner relation @xmath5 @xcite to the pion decay constant @xmath6 and the chiral condensate .",
    "( ii ) the gluon condensate @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 as chromodynamic field strength tensor ; @xmath9 is the strong coupling ) is anchored in the qcd trace anomaly and the breaking of the dilatation symmetry .",
    "( iii ) the quark - gluon condensate @xmath10 may also be considered as order parameter of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "there are ( infinitely ) many other condensates which may be ordered according to their mass dimension .",
    "these quantities occur in the evaluation of the current - current correlator by means of an operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "since organized as corrections in increasing powers of inverse hadron momentum , the ( poorly known ) higher - order condensates are expected to be of minor importance , so that the few low - dimension condensates suffice .    however , there are special circumstances , for instance in the borel transformed qcd sum rules for light vector mesons , in which the low - order condensates are numerically suppressed .",
    "specifically , the chiral condensate enters in the renormalization invariant combination @xmath11 being a tiny contribution due to the smallness of @xmath3 . instead",
    ", the four - quark condensates become important . in a flavor - symmetric vacuum",
    ", there are 10 independent four - quark condensates @xcite , all with highly unsettled values .",
    "the situation becomes even more dramatic when extending the qcd sum rule approach to a strongly interacting medium @xcite . at finite baryon density @xmath12 and temperature @xmath13 the condensates",
    "are modified , as exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] for the chiral and the gluon condensate , and further condensate structures arise .",
    "this modification is expected to be reflected in hadron properties @xcite . in particular , the approach to chiral symmetry restoration was thought to be measurable by investigating hadrons embedded in a strongly interacting medium @xcite .",
    "the qcd sum rule approach provides , however , a more involved relation .",
    "the in - medium modifications of light vector mesons depend crucially on the density dependence of a certain combination of four - quark condensates @xcite . in a strongly interacting medium ,",
    "there are 44 independent four - quark condensates in the @xmath14 sector @xcite ; if flavor symmetry is satisfied this number reduces to 20 .",
    "these enter the qcd sum rules for different hadrons in different combinations .",
    "therefore , one can hope that a systematic investigation of various hadrons may shed light on the important four - quark condensate combinations .",
    "density and temperature dependence of chiral condensate ( left panel ) and gluon condensate ( right panel ) .",
    "the employed approximation is reliable only for small values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "note the different slopes in @xmath12 direction.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   density and temperature dependence of chiral condensate ( left panel ) and gluon condensate ( right panel ) .",
    "the employed approximation is reliable only for small values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "note the different slopes in @xmath12 direction.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    formally , four - quark condensates are qcd ground state expectation values of hermitian products of four quark operators which are to be dirac and lorentz scalars , color singlets and are to be invariant under parity and time reversal ( the latter for equilibrated systems ) .",
    "physically , the four - quark condensates quantify the correlated production of two quark - antiquark pairs in the physical vacuum .",
    "in contrast to the square of the chiral ( two - quark ) condensate , which accounts for uncorrelated production of two of these pairs , the four - quark condensates are a measure of the correlation and thus expose the complexity of the qcd ground state .",
    "especially , deviations from factorization , i.e.the approximation of unknown four - quark condensates in terms of the squared chiral condensate , justified in the large @xmath15 limit @xcite , represent effects of these more involved correlations .    as mentioned above , the chiral condensate @xmath16 is often considered an order parameter for the @xmath17 chiral symmetry of qcd and , therefore , its density and temperature dependence is investigated extensively . the change of @xmath16 ,",
    "however , might partially originate from virtual low - momentum pions and thus could not clearly signal partial restoration of chiral symmetry in matter @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of four - quark condensates as order parameters for spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is still an open issue . in @xcite a specific combination of four - quark condensates arising from the difference between vector and axial - vector correlators",
    "is proposed as such an alternative parameter .",
    "this combination ( shown to agree with vacuum factorization in the analysis of @xmath18 decay data @xcite ) is distinct from the four - quark condensates in the nucleon channel as well as from the combination in the @xmath0 sum rule @xcite .",
    "for instance , in vacuum qcd sum rules for the nucleon @xcite the four - quark condensate combination contains a chirally invariant part when assuming flavor symmetry ( @xmath19 is a flavor vector ) @xmath20 - \\frac34 \\left [ \\text{color structures with } \\ , \\lambda^a \\right ] , \\nonumber\\ ] ] since the condensates @xmath21 and @xmath22 are invariants w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath17 transformation @xmath23 and contains another part @xmath24 - \\frac34 \\left [ \\text{color structures with } \\ , \\lambda^a \\right ] \\nonumber\\ ] ] including condensates which break the @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the vanishing of the four - quark condensates in this second part would restore the broken @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the combinations are weighted by polynomials of the mixing parameter @xmath25 allowing general forms of the nucleon interpolating field . in the preferred case @xmath26 ( the ioffe current for the nucleon ) only the chirally invariant part survives and thus this remainder can not be used as an order parameter .",
    "additional insight into the change of four - quark condensates and their role as order parameters of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking could be acquired from other hadronic channels .    nevertheless , when identifying chiral symmetry restoration with degenerating vector ( @xmath27 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath28 ) spectral functions the four - quark condensates occur as order parameter  @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 showing ( i ) that four - quark condensates are important for chiral symmetry restoration in the sense of degeneracy of vector and axial - vector currents , and ( ii ) that such formulations refer to moments , i.e. , weighted integrals .",
    "our contribution is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : disprel ] , we consider a dispersion relation being the starting point of the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "section  [ sec : probes ] is devoted to specific cases : the status of the @xmath0 meson is recapitulated  ( [ sec : probes].1 ) and the nucleon is discussed  ( [ sec : probes].2 ) .",
    "the case of the @xmath1 meson as an example for the light - heavy flavor sector is dealt with  ( [ sec : probes].3 , where a brief remark is made on the @xmath31 as example for the heavy - heavy sector ) .",
    "the summary can be found in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "let be given the analytical properties of the correlation function @xmath32 of a selected hadron ( actually , all hadronic excitations with a given set of the same quantum numbers ) , such that it can be expressed through its spectral function @xmath33 via the dispersion relation @xmath34 this leads to the celebrated form employed in qcd sum rules .",
    "the l.h.s .  contains the hadronic spectral function , while the r.h.s .",
    "is evaluated , for large euclidian energies @xmath35 and fixed momenta @xmath36 , by means of the ope .",
    "we assume for the moment being that the r.h.s.is settled . in order to attempt the isolation of the contribution of the lowest hadronic excitation one can perform the following chain of reformulations .",
    "define even (  e  ) and odd (  o  ) contributions @xmath37 and split the integrals with respect to the low - lying hadron under consideration in the intervals @xmath38 for positive energy and @xmath39 for negative energy @xmath40 the integrals on the r.h.s .  can be converted into expressions similar to the ope by exploiting the semi - local duality hypothesis .",
    "defining further the moments @xmath41 the even and odd sum rules can be rephrased to formulate relations which rather depend on ratios than purely on absolute spectral integrals . in a combined resulting sum rule @xmath42 the integral over",
    "the negative energy contribution seems to be  eliminated  .",
    "( this contribution , however , is still included in the ratio @xmath43 . )    in the special case of an anti - symmetric spectral function , @xmath44 , e.g. for @xmath45 and @xmath0 , one obtains with @xmath46 that @xmath47 , @xmath48 and ( using @xmath49 ) @xmath50 .",
    "therefrom one can define a normalized moment for the borel transform @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the borel mass .",
    "determined by the ratio of @xmath53 and its logarithmic derivative , this quantity is model independent ( but suffers from the ad hoc introduced continuum threshold @xmath54 ) .",
    "its meaning becomes obvious for a pole ansatz , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 follows .    in the generic case , however , the excitation spectrum of particles and anti - particles in a medium is asymmetric , and the dispersion relation ( [ eq : dispersionrelationansatz ] ) alone seems not to allow separate model - independent statements about the low - lying excitation at positive energy .",
    "this appears as a severe limitation of this form of the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath45 mesons , including their mixing , have been dealt with in @xcite in detail . in @xcite",
    "the combined four - quark condensates contributing to the ope terms @xmath57 in the qcd sum rule for the @xmath0 meson have been assigned a strong density dependence , at least @xmath58 .",
    "otherwise the numerically large landau damping term would push up the weighted strength @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the experiment @xcite finds a lowering of the @xmath0 strength .",
    "[ fig.2 ] exhibits the density dependence of the mass parameter ( [ mass_parameter ] ) .",
    "note that this parameter coincides only in zero - width approximation with the @xmath0 pole mass squared ; in general it is a normalized moment of @xmath59 to be calculated from data or models .",
    "-3 mm      the nucleon qcd sum rule is more involved since several dirac structures need to be considered @xcite : @xmath60 i.e. , besides the even and odd parts one has @xmath61 with @xmath62 , where @xmath63 refers to the four - velocity of the medium .",
    "we evaluate the qcd sum rule by utilizing the ansatz @xmath64 , \\ ] ] with the implication @xmath65 the quantities @xmath66 are related , in the ansatz , to the scalar and vector contributions to the self - energy , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "changes of the self - energies under individual variations of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 are reported in @xcite .",
    "the variation of the genuine chiral condensate @xmath2 causes only tiny changes .",
    "the @xmath1 meson qcd sum rule is entered @xcite by the combination @xmath80 , i.e. , the charm mass @xmath81 acts as magnifier of the chiral condensate .",
    "the evaluation of the sum rule for the @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 multiplet involves the renormalization of non - perturbative condensates in order to compensate the parts of perturbative contributions , which are dominated by the non - vanishing mass scales .",
    "these parts are of non - perturbative origin and thus should be covered by the appropriately defined non - perturbative condensates ( usually called  non - normal ordered ",
    "condensates @xcite ) @xmath85 \\right \\rangle,\\ ] ] which quantify the non - perturbative regime @xcite .",
    "the integral denotes the perturbatively calculated contribution @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath86 is a function of the covariant derivative and contains general dirac structures , @xmath28 is the gluon gauge field in fixed - point gauge and @xmath87 its fourier transform ; @xmath88 denotes normal ordering , and @xmath89 is the quark propagator in the gluonic background field",
    ".    application of this condensate renormalization cancels mass logarithms in ope calculations @xcite and causes a mixing between different types of condensates , e.g. , the chiral condensate mixes with the gluon condensate ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) @xmath90 which relates in the heavy quark sector the heavy quark condensate ( e.g.  @xmath91 for the charm condensate ) to gluon condensates @xcite @xmath92 this is utilized in the qcd sum rule for the @xmath31 meson entered by the combination @xmath93 , which one expects to exhibit the weak density dependence of the gluon condensate , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in fact , the evaluation of the qcd sum rule for @xmath31 shows only a tiny change of the in - medium mass @xcite .    in finite density qcd sum rules for the @xmath1 meson ,",
    "medium - specific condensates appear and introduce , via their mixing , further gluon condensates into the ope .",
    "an example is @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the renormalization scale , already introduced in ( [ eq.17 ] ) . the complete reevaluation of the in - medium @xmath1 meson qcd sum rules , in particular the complete ope side up to mass dimension 6 for products of quark masses and condensates , is under investigation .",
    "in summary we survey the qcd sum rules for the @xmath0 meson and the nucleon .",
    "the sum rules allow for a direct relation of hadron properties to qcd condensates which change at nonzero baryon density .",
    "the genuine chiral condensate has numerically a small influence in the borel transformed sum rules . instead , the four - quark condensates determine to a large extent the density dependence of these hadrons composed of light quarks .",
    "in contrast , in the heavy - light quark sector , e.g. , represented by @xmath1 mesons , the impact of the chiral condensate is expected to become noticeable . a systematic investigation of various hadron species is needed to investigate the role of the many four - quark condensates entering the qcd sum rules in different combinations .        99 -2pt m.a .",
