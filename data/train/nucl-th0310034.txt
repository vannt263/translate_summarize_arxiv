    "the production of @xmath0 mesons in two - nucleon collisions depends strongly on the final state interaction ( fsi ) as has been stressed in previous work  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding this fact , the interaction between the final particles was treated in quite an approximate way .",
    "only the @xmath1 interaction has been considered in a more precise manner .",
    "the interaction of the @xmath0 meson either was not considered at all or simulated by means of a watson enhancement factor . in view of this apparent lack of a correct treatment of fsi",
    "we want to study this reaction by using a rigorous three - body model .",
    "the properties of the @xmath3 system , containing three free particles in the asymptotic region , were investigated in @xcite where fsi effects in @xmath4 reactions as well as in @xmath0 photoproduction on a deuteron were studied . as was shown in detail ,",
    "the three - body aspects of fsi are very important , at least near the threshold region where @xmath5 waves give by far the largest contribution to the production process .",
    "it is obvious that the three - body @xmath5 wave part is most sensitive to fsi in view of the dominance of the @xmath5 wave interaction in the @xmath1 and @xmath6 subsystems at low energies .",
    "furthermore , it is intuitively clear that primarily the central region of the system , where @xmath5 waves dominate , is distorted by multiple scattering events . as a consequence , close to threshold",
    "the @xmath3 interaction strongly enhances the @xmath7 cross section . at higher energies , where the large spatial extension of the deuteron comes into play , an essential fraction of higher partial waves contributes increasingly to the @xmath0 production mechanism",
    "this rapidly reduces the relative @xmath5 wave contribution to the reaction amplitude , so that the role of fsi diminishes considerably with increasing energy . as a result , already in the region of c.m .",
    "excess energies above 100 mev the behavior of the cross section is well explained in the plane wave approximation for the final state  @xcite .",
    "turning now to the process @xmath8 , firstly we would like to note that in this case the influence of fsi must be even more important . here",
    "the characteristic radius @xmath9 of the reaction , determined by @xmath10 with @xmath11 as typical momentum transfer , is only about 0.3  fm .",
    "this value is much smaller than in photoproduction , where not too close to the threshold the characteristic range is given by the deuteron radius @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 2  fm .",
    "therefore , one may expect that for energies for which @xmath14 is valid , with @xmath15 denoting the maximal c.m.momentum of the final particles , the final state will be dominated by @xmath5 waves , for which the role of the @xmath3 interaction is crucial .",
    "indeed , as will be shown below , in the region from threshold up to an excess energy @xmath16 mev , the contribution of higher partial waves in the final state is of much minor importance compared to the @xmath5 wave contribution . in this connection",
    ", the reaction @xmath17 seems in general to be more suited for studying the interaction in the @xmath3 system than @xmath0 photoproduction , where fsi has a smaller influence .",
    "this advantage is however strongly reduced by a poor knowledge of the @xmath0 production mechanism in @xmath1 collisions .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the reactions @xmath18 and @xmath2 in the region of excess energy up to @xmath16 mev which is covered in recent experiments as well as in theoretical studies ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the two questions which we address here are :    \\(i ) to what extent are the three - body aspects essential for a quantitative description of fsi ?",
    "as was already stressed in  @xcite , the importance of a three - body treatment of fsi is dictated by the proximity of a virtual pole in the @xmath3 amplitude to the physical region  @xcite . because of this property a perturbative approach to the @xmath3 dynamics , where only the interactions in the two - body @xmath1 and @xmath6 subsystems are taken into account , is of little use . in the present study we would like to demonstrate this fact for @xmath0 production in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "\\(ii ) what is the role of higher @xmath1 partial waves ? according to nakayama @xcite , the puzzling second bump in the @xmath19 invariant mass distribution of @xmath2 measured at @xmath20 mev in  @xcite could be understood as arising mostly from a contribution of the @xmath21 state of the final nucleon pair .",
    "however , the size of @xmath22 wave contribution appears to be comparable with that of the @xmath23 one ( see e.g.  fig .  4 in  @xcite ) .",
    "such a large @xmath22 wave effect in the region where the @xmath1 c.m .",
    "kinetic energy is limited to @xmath24  mev ( and in fact the maximum of the distribution of @xmath25 is located at even a considerably lower value because of the preference of higher @xmath0 momenta ) is quite surprising . therefore , we have investigated again the influence of @xmath5 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 partial @xmath1 waves in both isospin states using the paris @xmath1 potential .",
    "another point , closely connected to this , is the role of the short range behaviour of the @xmath1 interaction which is enhanced by quite large momentum transfers accompanying the @xmath0 production .",
    "as will be shown below , this leads in particular to an important role of the tensor force in the final @xmath27 triplet state for @xmath18 because the @xmath28 state , excited in the @xmath0 production process , couples to the @xmath29 partial wave during subsequent @xmath1 rescattering .",
    "first we review briefly in the next section the most essential formal ingredients on which our calculation is based . for the driving @xmath30 transition potential",
    "we take a meson exchange model including @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath0 exchanges .",
    "the two - body @xmath6 and @xmath1 interactions are parametrized in terms of separable @xmath33 matrices .",
    "the dominant @xmath5 wave part of the @xmath3 wave function is calculated using three - body scattering theory . in sect .  [ sect2 ] our results",
    "are compared with experimental data and in sect .",
    "[ sect4 ] the most important conclusions are summarized . in an appendix we list detailed expressions for the @xmath34 amplitude .",
    "in the center of mass system the reaction to be studied reads in detail @xmath35 where the energies and momenta of the participating particles are explicitly defined for later purpose .",
    "the reaction is governed by the transition matrix element @xmath36 where initial and final states are characterized by the total spin @xmath37 and isospin @xmath38 of the nucleon pair .",
    "the calculation is done in the region of c.m .",
    "excess energy @xmath39 up to 60 mev .",
    "thus the use of nonrelativistic expressions for the energies of the final particles is justified , whereas for the initial state relativistic expressions are taken .",
    "the c.m .",
    "cross section for @xmath2 is then given by @xmath40 where the relative momentum of the two final nucleons @xmath41 is introduced .",
    "the factor @xmath42 results from the average over initial spin states .",
    "the corresponding @xmath18 cross section is obtained from ( [ 20 ] ) by the substitution @xmath43 for the @xmath0 production mechanism we have adopted the usual model where first an @xmath44 resonance is excited on one of the nucleons which subsequently decays into the @xmath6 channel .",
    "the submatrix @xmath45 associated with the transition @xmath34 is expressed as a linear combination of eight pseudoscalar operators @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) built from the vectors @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and spin operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath49 denotes the relative momentum of the @xmath53 system .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath54 are functions of only @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and their specific form depends on the model for the @xmath0 production mechanism . for the operators",
    "@xmath46 we have chosen the following forms @xmath58 }   \\otimes(\\vec{p}^{\\,\\,(\\prime)}\\otimes(\\vec{p}\\times\\vec{p}\\,'))^{[2 ] } \\right\\}^{[0]}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter two operators are tensor operators in two - nucleon spin space describing a spin transfer of 2 in the transition to the @xmath53 state .",
    "for the impulse approximation ( ia ) , where fsi is ignored , the amplitude @xmath59 ( [ 15 ] ) is given by @xmath60    @xmath61 describes the propagation of the @xmath53 configuration followed by the decay @xmath62 .    with respect to the spin structure of the amplitude ,",
    "only three types of transitions are possible , namely @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . the transition @xmath66 is excluded since it does not conserve parity .",
    "it is easily seen that the operators @xmath67 through @xmath68 contribute to all three types of transitions .",
    "the operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 , being antisymmetric under exchange of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , appear only in channels with a change of spin , i.e.  @xmath63 and @xmath64 , whereas @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which require flipping of the spins of both nucleons , contribute only to @xmath65 .    at low energies ,",
    "the channel @xmath64 is strongly favored in the @xmath2 reaction since it allows the final nucleons to be left in a relative @xmath5 wave whose contribution is further increased by fsi . for the reaction @xmath18 both spin changing transitions are possible near threshold .",
    "apart from a trivial isospin factor 3 appearing for @xmath73 , their relative importance depends crucially on the interference between @xmath31 and @xmath32 exchange  @xcite . the transition @xmath65 , which requires either the nucleons to be in a relative @xmath22 state or the @xmath0 meson to be emitted at least in a @xmath22 state is suppressed at low energies .    after these more formal considerations we will now turn to the outline of the @xmath0 production model used in the present work . the @xmath0 production mechanism via @xmath44 excitation through meson exchange was considered in a variety of previous studies  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have adopted this approach including only @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath0 mesons whose contributions was investigated in greater detail than those of @xmath74 , @xmath75 and other mesons .",
    "the corresponding lagrangians are taken in the customary form @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the four momentum of the exchanged meson and @xmath78 the relative meson nucleon three momentum with @xmath79 .",
    "further , each meson nucleon vertex @xmath80 with @xmath81 contains a form factor of monopole type @xmath82 the corresponding @xmath83 transition vertices with @xmath84 are regularized by form factors of the form @xmath85 for the @xmath86 vertex the same form factor as for @xmath87 is used . with this meson exchange model",
    "the functions @xmath54 appearing in ( [ 25 ] ) can be written as a sum over the participating mesons @xmath88 detailed expressions for @xmath89 @xmath90 are listed in the appendix .    following the work of @xcite , the main calculation is based on the assumption that the @xmath34 transition is dominated by @xmath32 exchange .",
    "the contribution of @xmath31 meson exchange to the amplitude is about three times smaller .",
    "the @xmath0 meson with an @xmath3 coupling @xmath91 from  @xcite provides only a tiny correction at the level of about 3  % .",
    "the @xmath86 coupling constant @xmath92 was treated as a free parameter .",
    "it was adjusted in such a way that the total cross section in both channels , @xmath19 and @xmath27 , is normalized to the corresponding data with the same normalization factor @xmath93 .",
    "this factor takes effectively into account the damping of the initial beam via inelastic collisions other than @xmath94 .",
    "the parameters appearing in ( [ 45 ] ) to ( [ 47 ] ) are listed in tables [ table1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "those for the @xmath80 couplings , used also in  @xcite are given in  @xcite , except for @xmath95 which was taken from  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath96 and @xmath97 parameters are taken from  @xcite and @xcite as is explained below . with this set of parameters we obtain as normalization factor @xmath98 , which is appreciably smaller than the value @xmath99 of  @xcite and also less than the values 0.23 and 0.2 obtained respectively in  @xcite and @xcite . in view of some obvious limitations adopted here for the production potential , e.g. , neglect of direct emission of an @xmath0 meson by one of the nucleons as well as the contribution of other mesons ,",
    "we do not put too much significance on this quite small value for the damping factor @xmath100 .    clearly , the present model is only one of possible ways to parametrize the @xmath34 transition amplitude . as was discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the isovector exchange with a dominance of @xmath32 over @xmath31 exchange is consistent with the observed ratio of about 6.5 of the @xmath18 to @xmath2 cross section @xcite as well as with the characteristic @xmath101-dependence of the @xmath0 angular distribution @xcite . for this model",
    "the transition with @xmath73 strongly dominates over @xmath102 and , among others , results in a large probability of deuteron formation  @xcite in agreement with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "however , as has been shown in  @xcite and @xcite , more sophisticated treatments of the initial state interaction as well as inclusion of genuine two - body meson production mechanisms favour @xmath31 dominance .",
    "therefore , in order to broaden our theoretical basis , we consider in addition the second type of @xmath34 potential , where the @xmath32 meson is neglected .",
    "another purpose of using such an extreme approximation is to see to which extent the fsi effects depend on the details of the @xmath34 transition .",
    "one might anticipate the result that due to the short - range nature of the @xmath34 interaction such a dependence can not be very significant .",
    "however , in view of the basic theoretical uncertainties with respect to the production mechanism , this question has to be investigated quantitatively . indeed , as will be shown below , the sensitivity of fsi effects to the variation of the relative strength of @xmath31 to @xmath32 exchanges in the production potential , although not very dramatic , results in a variation of fsi effects of about 30  % .",
    "our method of solving the three - body equations is based on separable representations of the driving two - body forces . for the @xmath6 interaction we use the isobar model of @xcite , where the resonance parametrization of the partial wave amplitudes is fitted to the @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 channels . in particular in the @xmath106 channel only the @xmath107 resonance was taken into account . apart from the original set of @xmath106 parameters presented in @xcite , which gives for the @xmath6 scattering length @xmath108  fm",
    ", we considered another parametrization listed in table  [ tab2 ] , which gives a value twice as large , namely @xmath109  fm , and at the same time allows one to describe well the above - listed reactions .",
    "more details are given in  @xcite .",
    "these two sets of parameters are used to study the sensitivity of the result to the @xmath6 interaction model .",
    "the @xmath1 interaction is included in @xmath5 , @xmath22 and @xmath26 waves in both isospin states , namely @xmath23 , @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , and @xmath112 waves for @xmath102 and @xmath29 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) for @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding off - shell amplitudes were obtained using the separable representation of the paris potential from  @xcite .",
    "the remaining higher partial waves of the @xmath1 subsystem were taken as plane waves .",
    "the faddeev equations for the @xmath3 system were solved only for the states of lowest angular momentum where a relative two - particle @xmath5 state , either @xmath116 or @xmath117 , is coupled with an @xmath5 state of the third particle relative to this pair , resulting in the partitions @xmath118 or @xmath119 , respectively .",
    "as the explicit calculation shows , in the energy region of current interest , @xmath120 mev , these @xmath5 waves are almost totally overlapping .",
    "the other partial waves were treated perturbatively up to first order in the @xmath6 and @xmath1 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the separable representation of the two - body @xmath33 matrices allows one to reduce the original faddeev equations to a set of two integral equations in one variable only , presented schematically in fig .",
    "their structure is identical to the usual lippmann - schwinger equation for the two coupled channels @xmath121 and @xmath122 , where the notation `` @xmath123 '' is used for the interacting @xmath1 subsystem .",
    "the reaction amplitude @xmath124 is then expressed in terms of the auxiliary quasi - two - body amplitudes @xmath125 and @xmath126 as is presented in the same figure . with respect to the application of three - body scattering theory to reactions with three free particles in the final state",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "some technical points concerning the @xmath3 problem are described in @xcite .",
    "we begin the discussion of our results with the total cross section shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] for @xmath2 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "as already noted , the three - body result is normalized to the data at one point , namely at @xmath127 mev to @xmath128b using promise - wasa data  @xcite for @xmath19 and to @xmath129b with celsius data  @xcite for @xmath27 .",
    "of course , the ratio between the different curves is fixed by the model .",
    "therefore , apart from the fact that the same normalization factor is used for both reactions , the only nontrivial result in figs .  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] is the energy dependence of the cross sections . for obvious reasons ,",
    "detailed experimental data are available for the @xmath2 reaction only , which , however , is much more difficult for a theoretical study of the near threshold region because of the coulomb interaction between the protons . in the present work we have not included the coulomb force , which fact , of course , hampers to some extent a quantitative comparison with the data . nevertheless , the results shown in figs .  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] allows us to draw the following conclusions :    the three - body model reproduces quite well the energy dependence of the experimental cross section in the @xmath19 channel .",
    "the deviation very close to threshold must primarily be ascribed to the neglect of coulomb repulsion . as for the @xmath27 channel",
    ", the agreement with the data of @xcite appears to be less satisfactory .",
    "the theory exhibits a more flat form of the cross section .",
    "clearly , for a meaningful conclusion about the quality of the present model a greater amount of data is needed , especially in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "the first - order calculation , where the fsi is reduced to only @xmath6 and @xmath1 rescatterings , does not reproduce the form of the @xmath2 cross section as predicted by the three - body treatment and also observed in the experiment . as was noted in the introduction ,",
    "it is expected that the leading terms associated with @xmath6 and @xmath1 rescatterings do not constitute a reliable approximation of the whole multiple scattering series , due to the slow convergence of this series in the vicinity of the virtual @xmath3 pole .",
    "the strong difference between the first order and the exact three - body calculation even at @xmath16 mev demonstrates the crucial importance of higher order terms .",
    "we consider this result as a direct evidence for the fact that a three - body approach is definitely needed for a correct treatment of the @xmath3 interaction .",
    "thus , the first - order approximation , although seemingly reasonable in view of the weak @xmath6 interaction as compared to the @xmath1 one , is in general not relevant .",
    "the question of a correct treatment of fsi in @xmath0 production is closely related to the relative fraction of @xmath5 waves in the final state . as was mentioned above , in accordance with the short range hypothesis for the @xmath0 production mechanism ,",
    "the @xmath5 waves in the @xmath3 system are expected to provide the major part of the cross section in the threshold region , thus making the fsi effect to be of particular importance in this reaction . in this context",
    "it is instructive to compare the relative contribution of the @xmath5 waves to the total cross sections of @xmath130 and @xmath2 .",
    "the results of the ia for both processes are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the @xmath131 contribution  @xcite is shown separately . because of the relatively long range nature of the mechanism for @xmath0 photoproduction on the deuteron , the contribution of higher partial waves in the final state increases rapidly and already at the energy @xmath16 mev the @xmath5 wave provides only a 10 @xmath132 fraction of the total cross section .",
    "in contrast to this , the @xmath131 configuration strongly dominates the reaction @xmath2 in the whole energy region , so that even at @xmath16 mev it produces about 77 % of the cross section . in conclusion ,",
    "the role of the final state interaction depends not only on the phase space available for the final particles ( which is the same for both reactions ) but much more crucially on the range of the primary @xmath34 transition interaction .    on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the dependence of the results on the model ingredients is exhibited .",
    "firstly , we would like to note a visible sensitivity of the cross section to the choice of which meson exchange governs the production potential .",
    "namely , @xmath31 dominance tends to make the form of the total cross section more convex as compared to the full curve where @xmath32 exchange prevails , whereas the ia gives in both cases practically indistinguishable results except for the normalization factor @xmath100 . using a weaker @xmath6 interaction from @xcite ,",
    "we obtain , as expected , a weaker influence of fsi as is shown by the dash - dotted line in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we compare our calculation for the @xmath19 invariant mass distribution with the cosy-11  @xcite and tof  @xcite data . at the excess energy @xmath133 mev the three - body result was normalized to the experimental integrated cross section @xmath134 @xmath135b of  @xcite .",
    "the distribution at @xmath20 mev is given in arbitrary units and the theoretical full curve was normalized to the area enclosed by the data points . for a lower excess energy @xmath136 mev one finds a reasonable agreement of the three - body calculation with the data , although one notes a systematic slight underestimation of the experimental cross section in the region above @xmath137  ( gev)@xmath138 .",
    "at least some part of the deviation stems again from an overestimation of the @xmath19 interaction effect at the lower end of the spectrum due to the neglect of the coulomb force . in view of the overall normalization",
    ", inclusion of the coulomb repulsion would reduce the @xmath23 peak near @xmath139 , and would enhance the other part of the distribution .    however , at the higher excess energy @xmath140 mev the shape of the theoretical distribution is in strong disagreement with the data . in particular ,",
    "the broad maximum around @xmath141  gev@xmath138 is not explained . of course , in order to reach at a definite conclusion , the coulomb interaction must be included in addition , but it is very unlikely that this would have such a strong effect as to explain the shape .",
    "moreover , our results are at variance with those of  @xcite where an appreciable contribution of higher angular momentum states in the @xmath19 subsystem is predicted , whereas our calculation does not indicate a sizeable influence from @xmath22 and @xmath26 partial @xmath1 waves . the corresponding contributions can be estimated by comparison of the full and the dash - dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in the latter calculation",
    "only the lowest @xmath131 configuration in the @xmath3 final state was included .    on the other hand",
    ", it is worth to underline the importance of the @xmath1 tensor force , which increases quite appreciably the transition to the @xmath29 state from an intermediate @xmath28 after @xmath0 production .",
    "the relevance of this intermediate @xmath28 state is related to the strong momentum transfer accompanying @xmath0 production and emphasizing the high momentum components of the @xmath1 wave function .",
    "one of the consequences of this fact is that the enhancement by the @xmath1 interaction for the @xmath73 transition is even slightly stronger than that for @xmath102 .",
    "this result is at variance with  @xcite , where a ratio of the enhancement factors of @xmath102 to @xmath73 of 1.85 at relative @xmath1 momenta @xmath142 @xmath143 was found . according to our results in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , this ratio is reduced from 1.35 to only 0.98 at @xmath144 @xmath143 if the transition @xmath145 is included .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the calculated distribution with respect to the @xmath0 kinetic energy @xmath146 in @xmath2 is plotted together with the celsius data @xcite .",
    "one readily notes quite a good agreement except for a very small region close to the maximal kinetic energy .",
    "we do not consider this discrepancy as a serious defect because , as was noted in  @xcite , some fraction of the events must have been lost .",
    "furthermore , we would like to point out that the data of the @xmath19 mass distribution at @xmath140  mev in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] appears to be in conflict with the data at @xmath147  mev in the right panel of fig .",
    "the latter increases monotonically with meson energy except very close to the maximal kinetic energy @xmath146 , whereas the tof results for @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] exhibit a pronounced broad maximum at intermediate @xmath19 masses . in view of the simple relation @xmath149 one would expect on the other hand a similar behaviour for both distributions , because the small difference in the energies can hardly result in a very different form of the spectrum .",
    "thus new experimental data for the @xmath146 and/or @xmath150 distributions in the region @xmath151 mev are needed in order to resolve this discrepancy .    finally , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the angular distribution of an emitted proton for two excess energies .",
    "the dominance of @xmath32 exchange in the production mechanism leads to a pronounced isotropy of the cross sections .",
    "this becomes apparent by comparison with the angular distributions using a pure @xmath31 exchange .",
    "they exhibit a much stronger angular dependence with a more pronounced peaking at forward and backward directions , which is consistent with a more periferal character of the @xmath31 exchange mechanism . in general , the proton angular distribution with a weak @xmath152 dependence is consistent with the almost isotropic form of the experimental results of @xcite , although the observed magnitude at @xmath140 mev is overestimated by about 20 % .",
    "furthermore , one should keep in mind the pronounced disagreement between theory and the tof data for the @xmath153 spectrum at the same energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . with respect to the @xmath0 angular distribution",
    ", we did not analyze it here in view of its obvious sensitivity to higher @xmath6 resonances , predominantly @xmath154 , which were omitted in the present calculation .",
    "in the present paper we have investigated @xmath0 production in @xmath1 collisions in the near threshold region .",
    "the main attention was focussed on the understanding of the role of fsi , which is expected to strongly influence the reaction dynamics near threshold .",
    "we believe that in conjunction with previous work  @xcite the present study was necessary in order to establish a unified picture of this reaction .",
    "in particular , it can be quite useful for the planning and analysis of future experiments . from our results",
    "we draw the following conclusions :    \\(i ) the three - body treatment of the @xmath3 interaction provides a satisfactory , quantitative explanation of the energy dependence of the total cross section for @xmath2 .",
    "however , the dependence of the results on the details of the @xmath34 transition introduces some uncertainty .",
    "in particular , assuming a pion exchange dominance in the production potential leads to stronger energy dependence of the cross section and requires , therefore , a weaker @xmath6 interaction in order to bring the theory into agreement with the data .",
    "\\(ii ) there is a discrepancy between our results and the data of  @xcite for the @xmath153 distribution at a c.m.excess energy @xmath140 mev .",
    "namely , the broad peak of the data is not described by the theory . comparing to other theoretical work",
    ", we do not reproduce the result of  @xcite , where this broad structure is explained by the contribution of higher partial waves in the @xmath1 subsystem . on the contrary , according to our findings the contribution of @xmath22 and @xmath26 waves in the final @xmath19 subsystem plays a minor role only , at least in the region up to @xmath16 mev considered in the present work .",
    "\\(iii ) even close to threshold , where the final @xmath1 system is predominantly in an @xmath5 wave state , the tensor @xmath1 force in the @xmath155 channel must be taken into account .",
    "as we have shown , the intermediate transition to a @xmath28 configuration with subsequent rescattering into the @xmath29 state enhances sizeably the @xmath1 interaction effect in the triplet state .    before concluding",
    ", we would like to note that the sensitivity of the fsi effect to the @xmath34 transition mentioned in ( i ) indicates that in principle the short range part of the final state wave function must be calculated more thoroughly than is done here .",
    "obviously , the most straightforward way would be a three - body treatment of the whole @xmath94 process without restriction to the final state .",
    "however it seems to be very difficult in view of the great amount of channels which have to be included in such an approach , not to mention the pure theoretical ambiguity in treating the @xmath1 system within the three - body formalism . on the other hand",
    ", one can expect that short range mechanisms may be included perturbatively .",
    "for example , the @xmath156 configurations could be considered in first order only ( apart from the driving meson exchange potential ) by including the additional mechanism where a pion , created in an @xmath1 collision , produces in turn an @xmath0 via rescattering on one of the nucleons .",
    "clearly , such an approach , which would allow us to adopt the same fsi concept , is practically much easier to manage than a rigorous solution of the three - body coupled channel model .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 443 ) .",
    "in this appendix we give the explicit expressions for the amplitudes @xmath157 , @xmath158 for the transition @xmath34 determining the transition matrix element @xmath159 .",
    "the latter was defined in the c.m.system with @xmath48 and @xmath49 denoting the momenta of the initial and final states , respectively . in the following expressions",
    "we have introduced the notations : @xmath160    the expressions for @xmath32 exchange are obtained by using the on - shell gordon decomposition of the nucleon current @xmath161 u(\\vec{p}\\,)\\ ] ] and the analogous relation for the @xmath86 coupling . in the present paper the invariant energy @xmath162 of the @xmath44 or @xmath6 subsystem was determined according to the spectator on - shell scheme @xmath163 which is consistent with the nonrelativistic three - body treatment of the @xmath3 system .",
    "furthermore , this choice of @xmath162 justifies the use of the gordon decomposition for the tensor part in the @xmath87 coupling since in this case the nucleon remains on - shell after emission of a @xmath32 meson . the only approximation , whose validity is not justified is the gordon relation for the @xmath86 coupling .",
    "we believe , however , that , since the coupling constant @xmath164 is treated here as a free parameter , it is a reasonable approximation .",
