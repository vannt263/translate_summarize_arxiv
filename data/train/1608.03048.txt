    "study of superheavy elements ( she , nuclear charge @xmath1 ) is an important area of research motivated by the search of hypothetical stability island ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "experimental work focuses mostly on production and detection of she and study of their chemical properties , while there is also some progress in the measurements of the atomic properties .",
    "the heaviest element for which ionization potential has been measured is lawrencium ( @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "there is good progress in the measurements of the frequencies of strong electric dipole transitions including hyperfine structure and isotope shift for nobelium ( @xmath3 )  @xcite . for heavier atoms the information about their atomic properties comes mostly from atomic calculations .",
    "the calculations may help in experimental progress and predict chemical properties of she .",
    "apart from that the she represent an interesting objects from pure theoretical point of view due to strong interplay between correlation and relativistic effects .",
    "for example , strong relativistic effects often lead to breaking similarity in chemical properties between she and their lighter analogs ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we study she uut , fl and uup ( @xmath0=113 , 114 and 115 ) . these elements are in the vicinity of the hypothetical stability island and have relatively simple electron structure .",
    "they can be considered as atoms with three ( uut , uup ) or four ( fl ) valence electrons .",
    "for such systems accurate calculations are possible .",
    "the atoms were studied before mostly by multi - configuration hartree - fock and and coupled cluster methods  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply a recently developed method which combines linearized single - double couple cluster ( sd ) and configuration interaction ( ci ) methods .",
    "we present detailed study of the energy levels , ionization potentials , static scalar polarizabilities , and electron densities for the superheavy elements and their ions .",
    "we discuss the role of relativistic and correlation effects .",
    "atomic calculations always start from calculating the energy and the wave function of the ground state",
    ". then they may proceed to calculation of excited states , their lifetimes , transition amplitudes , etc . since there are no experimental data on atomic properties of superheavy elements considered in this paper we should decide which properties",
    "should be calculated with higher priorities .",
    "ionization potential ( ip ) and polarizability of an atom are obviously important parameters since they determine its interaction with environment and thus , its chemical properties .",
    "this can be illustrated by the following example .",
    "a way of detecting she and studying their chemical properties ( e.g , volatility ) is by observing the she absorption to an inert surface .",
    "the energy of the interaction of the she with the surface is given by the formula  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is atomic polarizability and @xmath6 is its ionization potential ; @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the substance of the slab , @xmath8 is the ionization potential of the slab atom , and @xmath9 is the surface - atom distance .    other important characteristics of she include frequencies of strong electric dipole transitions from the ground state since they are likely to be measured first .",
    "it is also instructive to have other excited states and electron densities and compare them to lighter analogs of she to study the role of relativistic effects .",
    "obtaining reliable results for superheavy elements ( she ) require accurate treatment of relativistic and many - body effects .",
    "the inclusion of the most important relativistic effects associated with the dirac equation is pretty straightforward .",
    "these relativistic effects are responsible for the difference between she and lighter atoms .",
    "inclusion of other relativistic corrections such as breit interaction , quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) corrections are also important for accurate results but they bring little difference in electron structure of she compared to lighter atoms .",
    "the main challenge for the calculations and largest uncertainty in the results comes from the treatment of the correlations .",
    "accurate results can be obtained for atoms with simple electron structure with few valence electrons .",
    "the highest accuracy can be achieved for fr - like and ra - like atoms and ions which have only one or two valence electrons well separated from the core in space and on energy scale  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider atoms and ions with three and four valence electrons from 13th to 15th groups of the periodic table .",
    "the method of treating correlations is presented in next section . note",
    "that while accurate treatment of correlations is very important for accurate results , the correlations for she are very similar to those of the lighter atoms and usually do not cause any significant difference in the atomic properties of she .",
    "for accurate treatment of correlations we use the combinations of the single - double ( sd ) coupled cluster method and the configuration interaction ( ci ) technique developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the sd+ci method ) . here",
    "we give its brief summary .",
    "all atomic electrons are divided into two categories , the core electrons , which occupy the closed - shell core of the atom , and valence electrons , which occupy outermost open shells .",
    "the wave function of the valence electrons is assumed to be in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of valence electrons ( @xmath11=3 for tl , e113 , bi and e115 , @xmath12 for pb and e114 ) , @xmath13 is a single - determinant basis state constructed from single - electron orbitals @xmath14 .",
    "for example , for two valence electrons @xmath15 the expansion coefficients @xmath16 in ( [ e : psi ] ) are found by solving the eigenvalue problem for the effective ci hamiltonian , @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 are one and two - electron parts of the hamiltonian .",
    "the one electron part is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are dirac matrixes , @xmath23 is the self - consistent potential of the atomic core ( including nuclear part ) , @xmath24 is the single - electron correlation operator responsible for the correlation interaction of a valence electron with the core",
    ".    two - electron part of the hamiltonian is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the correlation correction to the coulomb interaction between valence electrons caused by core electrons .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath26 operators represent core - valence correlations .",
    "they can be calculated in the lowest , second order of the many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) .",
    "inclusion of the second - order @xmath27 into the ci calculations leads to significant improvement of the accuracy of the calculations compared to the ci method with no @xmath27 .",
    "further improvements in accuracy is achieved when @xmath24 and @xmath26 are calculated to all orders using the sd approach  @xcite .",
    "this approach also includes core - core correlations .",
    "the sd equations for the core do not depend on valence electrons and remain the same regardless of whether the sd and ci methods combined together or not .",
    "these equations can be found elsewhere ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . the sd equations for valence states in the sd+ci method can be written in the form @xmath28    here parameters @xmath29 are coulomb integrals @xmath30 parameters @xmath7 are the single - electron hartree - fock energies , @xmath31 is an external parameter related to the energy of valence state of interest  @xcite .",

    "equations ( [ e : sdv ] ) are solved iteratively starting from @xmath39 the right - hand side of ( [ e : sdv ] ) contains only terms which do not change in the iterations .",
    "corresponding @xmath32 and @xmath33 coefficients are found from solving the sd equations for the core ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    after solving the sd equations , matrix elements for the @xmath24 and @xmath26",
    "operators can be found by @xmath40 and @xmath41    a complete set of single - electron states is needed for solving the sd equations ( [ e : sdv ] ) and for construction of the many - electron valence states ( [ e : psi ] ) .",
    "we use the same b - spline technique  @xcite in both cases .",

    "are solved for few ( usually three ) states above the core in each partial wave up to @xmath47 .",

    "non - relativistic limit corresponds to @xmath58 . varying the value of @xmath56 in ( [ e : dirac ] ) and corresponding computer codes allows us to study the role of relativistic effects in atoms .",
    "for example , it was used to search for the manifestations of the hypothetical space - time variation of the fine structure constant in atomic spectra ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "iterating hartree - fock equations with the breit term in the potential corresponds to the inclusion of the important relaxation effect ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . note that this also leads to inclusion of the higher - order breit corrections which have no physical meaning . in principle",
