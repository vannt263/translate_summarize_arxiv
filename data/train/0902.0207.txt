    "optical imaging system with large depth of field ( * dof * ) is required to produce sharp images@xcite . in photography ,",
    "the * dof * is the portion of a scene that appears sharp in the image , for example , the region denoted by * a * in fig .",
    "[ fig : dof ] . ordinarily , a lens focuses parallel rays of light at one distance known as the focal point , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ordinary_lens ] .",
    "therefore , not all points within the * dof * can be claimed as focused per se .",
    "however , due to a gradual decrease in the sharpness of the image from the focused spot , the amount of blurring within the * dof * is imperceptible to human eyes under normal viewing conditions . as such , in particularly for films and photography , the image region",
    "can be subdivided into two , where one lies within and the other lies external to the * dof*. in the photograph of fig . [",
    "fig : dof ] , the region * a * , wherein the image appears sharp and focused , is said to lie within the * dof * ; whereas the region * b * , in which region the image is blurred , is said to lie external to the * dof*.     illustration of depth of field .",
    "region * a * is within the depth of field ( * dof * ) , whereas the region * b * is outside of * dof*. the image is blurred drastically in region * b*. ]    alternatively , but equivalently , the * dof * in an imaging system is defined as the distance in the object space in which objects are considered to be in focus .",
    "the distance over which objects appear sharp can be increased by extending the * dof * of an imaging system .",
    "traditionally , the * dof * of an imaging system can be increased by either decreasing the size of lens aperture or by increasing the shutter speed , or through tweaking of the both .",
    "these methods , however , drastically reduces the amount of light passing through the lens and require extra lighting . for developing still images ,",
    "the required extra lighting can be accommodated by the use of a flash . for motion pictures , however , this approach proves to be inadequate , as typical video involves about thirty frames of images per second .",
    "in addition to this difficulty , the smaller lens aperture increases diffraction and this places a practical limit on the extent to which the * dof * of an optical imaging system can be enhanced by the aforementioned methods .",
    "that being said , can the * dof * of an imaging system be increased ( a ) without sacrificing the intensity of light passing through the lens and ( b ) without increasing the diffraction ?",
    "the answer to this question is yes and this approach involves some sort of digital filtering .",
    "an ideal ordinary lens is characterized by a single focal point . ]",
    "the digital filtering method requires a scheme for the image reconstruction algorithm based on the principles of wave optics@xcite .",
    "the image reconstruction code is often hardcoded in the accompanying digital processing unit ( * dpu * ) and , for this reason , the imaging method based on digital filtering is coined as the software assisted imaging technology or * sait * for short .",
    "the * sait * solution for an imaging system is a promising technology in that it has potential to increase the * dof * while encompassing altogether the processes of which ( a ) drastically reduce the amount of light passing through the lens and ( b ) those problems associated with increased diffraction due to the reduced diameter of the lens aperture .    the software assisted imaging technology is not as perfect as it sounds and it has some of its own problems to offer . among them , one directly relates to the image processing speed . in the traditional imaging solutions based on lenses , which i refer to as the analog technology , complex arrangement of lenses function to focus image at the focal plane from wherein",
    "the image is developed .",
    "as such systems based on analog technology by - pass the digital filtering stage altogether , images are developed instantaneously in analog imaging systems .",
    "however , due to the aforementioned problems and limitations of the traditional method for increasing the * dof * , the analog technology provides only a limited solution when concerning the image quality .",
    "the systems based on * sait * principle face problems that are exactly the opposite in nature from that of the analog systems . in principle , the reconstructed image by a way of image reconstruction algorithm can be made to resemble the original image to any level or degree of resemblance , provided the image processing speed is of no concern .",
    "but , such methodology would limit systems based on * sait * to still imagery applications and the video sector of the market must be discarded , which is a bad idea for business .",
    "naturally , for systems based on * sait * principle , a trade off must be made between the image quality and the image processing speed .    among the early pioneers to successfully commercialize imaging system based on * sait * are cathay and dowski , who did much of their work at the university of colorado@xcite . in the modern literature , their work is cited as `` wavefront coding . ''",
    "the * sait * solution based on wavefront coding has been trade marked by cdm optics , inc . , and it is known as the @xmath0 the imaging solution based on wavefront coding basically involves two stages : the input and the output stages .",
    "the input stage involves the optical element and this represents the hardware contribution side of the * sait * solution .",
    "the output stage involves the * dpu * , wherein the image reconstruction code base is hardcoded , and this represents the software contribution side of the * sait * solution .",
    "the optical element in * sait * solution is distinguished from the input stage of traditional imaging system , which is just complex series of ordinary lenses , in that it produces many focal points along the optical axis instead of just one at the focal plane .",
    "such optical element is referred to as lens having extended depth of focus ( or * edof * for short ) and this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : edof_lens ] .",
    "both the quality of reconstructed image and the image reconstruction speed are critically important in * sait*. in principle , the ordinary lens , such as the one illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ordinary_lens ] , can just as well serve as the input stage for the * sait * imaging systems .",
    "however , this must be done at the cost of overly complicated algorithm routines for the software side of the system .",
    "the length of image reconstruction code directly relates to the number of transistors in a * dpu*. as a simple rule of a thumb , more transistors there are in a * dpu * , more energy it requires to operate . and ,",
    "more lines of coding for the image reconstruction algorithm implies the slower processing speed for the reconstructed image output .",
    "the full-*hd * quality of a video involves sixty image frames every second .",
    "this implies , the application of sait system to full - hd video processing would require the image reconstruction time span of @xmath1 or less .",
    "the demand for very fast processing speed and low power consumption make ordinary lenses inadequate for the input stage of the * sait * system , which leave open for an alternate solution for the optical element to be used as the input stage .",
    "lens with extended depth of focus has many focal points , @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 and so on .",
