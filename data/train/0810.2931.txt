    "the origin of accretion process is still not well understood , but is it clear that it is strongly linked to the evolution and lifetime of the surrounding circumstellar accreting disk .",
    "it appears likely that , in the t - tauri phase , the inner disk is disrupted by the magnetic field of the central object in which the disk material is channelled along magnetic field lines to crash onto the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "the accreted material falls onto the star in accretion ring or spot , assuming that magnetospheric accretion column covers only a small fraction of the stellar photosphere .",
    "one of the main physical quantity controlling accretion material through the disk is the mass accretion rate , @xmath1 .",
    "recent observations of young low mass stars and brown dwarfs formation regions derived accretion rates increasing with the stellar masses : @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the derived sub and/or stellar masses depend on evolutionary tracks .",
    "however , these evolutionary models at young ages suffer from several uncertainties , mainly due to unknown initial conditions resulting from prior cloud collapse and accretion phases .",
    "the evolutionary tracks need to be modified to take into account accretion process that build up stars ,    the purpose of this poster is to present theoretical evolutionary models analyzing the effect of accretion on the evolution of young very low mass pre - main sequence stars and young brown dwarfs and the resulting uncertainties on the determination of masses and ages , based on detailed input physics describing the structure and evolution of such low mass objects and to extend it to the brown dwarfs regime .",
    "one of the main idea is to analyze the sensitivity of evolutionary tracks to different accretion rates in the stellar sub - stellar mass regime .",
