    "the higgs mechanism breaks electroweak symmetry in the standard model , giving mass to particles through its couplings .",
    "current data from electroweak precision measurements points to a light higgs ( @xmath3 gev @ 95% cl @xcite ) .",
    "however , the higgs has never been definitively observed ( @xmath4 gev at 95% cl @xcite ) .",
    "a standard model higgs suffers from the so - called hierarchy problem .",
    "the theory needs fine - tuned parameters to accomodate a light higgs mass .",
    "supersymmetry offers a solution to this problem , through a symmetry between fermions and bosons .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains two higgs doublets , leading to five physical higgs bosons : two neutral cp - even states ( h and h ) , one neutral cp - odd ( a ) , and two charged states ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . at tree - level , the masses are governed by two parameters , often taken to be @xmath7 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath8 , a is nearly degenerate with one of the cp - even states ( denoted @xmath9 ) . where @xmath10 gev ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .    in this same large @xmath0 region ,",
    "the cross sections for some production mechanisms such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 are enhanced by factors of @xmath16 .",
    "for example , with @xmath17 tev , @xmath18 and @xmath19 gev , the cross sections for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are each of order 10 pb@xcite .",
    "the cross section for @xmath22 is smaller , but within the same order of magnitude . in the same region ,",
    "the branching ratios to @xmath23 and @xmath24 dominate , at @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , independent of mass .",
    "due to their similar masses , cross - sections and branching ratios in the high @xmath0 region , we search for both a and @xmath9 simultaneously . at the tevatron ,",
    "we search for @xmath27 ( the @xmath28 final state is expected to be overwhelmed by dijet background ) and @xmath29 .",
    "this search is underway at cdf .",
    "the dominant issues for this analysis are : tau identification , ditau mass reconstruction , irreducible background from @xmath31 , and event loss at the trigger level .    wherever not specified , we use the benchmark case of @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 to quote efficiencies and cross - sections .",
    "compared to qcd jets , taus are highly collimated , leaving narrow jets with low track and photon multiplicity , and low mass .    in cdf ,",
    "when selecting taus , one typically requires a jet with high visible @xmath34 containing a high @xmath35 track .",
    "the jet is required to be isolated in a @xmath36 annulus around the high @xmath35 track .",
    "the visible energy in a @xmath37 cone is required to satisfy low track and photon multiplicity requirements and to reconstruct a mass @xmath38 gev .",
    "additionally , a requirement is made on the charge of the tracks in the @xmath37 cone when appropriate . in run",
    "i , cdf acheived fake rates in the range 1.2 - 0.7 % for jet @xmath34 between 20 and 200 gev@xcite .",
    "the full mass of a ditau system may be reconstructed @xcite if the neutrinos are assumed to travel in the same direction as their parent taus , by solving the following system of equations :    @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41 are the x and y components of the measured event missing energy , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the missing energy from each tau .",
    "equations [ eq : mass1 ] and [ eq : mass2 ] do not give a meaningful solution when the taus are back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "therefore , we require that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the azimuthal angle between the tau candidates .    when the solution to equations [ eq : mass1 ] and [ eq : mass2 ] gives @xmath46 or @xmath47 , the event is thrown out , causing about 50% of the higgs signal to be lost",
    ". however , 97% of w+jets events are rejected in this way , which would otherwise be a formidable background .",
    "we generate @xmath48 events in pythia 6.203 with @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 .",
    "after simulation of the run i cdf detector , a ditau mass distribution is reconstructed with a mean value of 93.7 gev with an rms of 24.1 gev .",
    "the dominant _ reducible _ backgrounds to this analysis are qcd , @xmath49 , and w+jets .",
    "@xmath31 is an irreducible background , but higgs events are more efficient for this search than z s for a couple of reasons .    first",
    ", in the high @xmath0 region , @xmath50 s have a high branching ratio to taus ( 9% ) compared to z s ( 3.7% ) .",
    "second , an @xmath50 is typically produced with a stiffer @xmath35 than a z. this means that the requirement @xmath44 , which is nearly equivalent to @xmath51 gev , is @xmath52 more efficient for higgs events than z events .",
    "since there was no @xmath53 trigger in run i at cdf , the analysis uses a lepton trigger requiring @xmath54 gev , seeking events with one leptonic and one hadronic decay .",
    "since only half of the signal events decay in this way , and of these , only 20% contain a lepton which satisfies the @xmath35 requirement within the acceptance , the signal rate is greatly diminished at the trigger level .",
    "this major loss at the trigger level is problematic , since the cross section drops by a factor of 4 from @xmath32 gev to @xmath55 gev , before the mass reconstruction , with an rms of 24 gev , can discriminate from @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , in run ii , cdf and d0 are both implementing triggers designed for tau physics",
    ". lowered @xmath35 thresholds and new decay modes available will greatly increase the acceptance for this search .    in run",
    "ii , cdf and d0 both have lepton + track triggers and @xmath56 triggers .",
    "in addition , both experiments are triggering on events with two hadronic taus .",
    "cdf s trigger is calorimeter - based , while d0 s is track - based .",
    "the run i search for @xmath48 is still work in progress , and the run ii analysis is also in the works .",
    "cdf performed this search in run i. both experiments expect to improve on the analysis in run ii .",
    "the run i search at cdf @xciteutilized a 4-jet trigger requiring @xmath58 gev .",
    "three b - tags were required based on displaced vertices , and the b jets were required to be separated in azimuthal angle , @xmath59 . to optimize sensitivity , the @xmath34 cuts on the jets varied with mass hypothesis . for mass hypothesis below 120 gev ( above 120 gev ) , the second and third b - tagged jets ( first and second jets ) ordered in @xmath34 were chosen for the mass reconstruction .",
    "the search is performed in mass windows dependedent on mass hypothesis .",
    "the product of branching ratio and acceptance ranged from 0.2 to 0.6% in the mass range 70 and 300 gev . for a mass hypothesis of 70 gev ,",
    "5 events were observed with 4.6 @xmath60 1.4 expected .",
    "only these 5 events appear in the higher mass windows .",
    "no excess above predicted is observed .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath61 region excluded .",
    "region exluded by the cdf search.,height=192 ]      at cdf , studies of @xmath62 events show an improved dijet mass resolution after correcting for muons , @xmath63 , and nonlinearities in the hadronic calorimeter .",
    "separate studies of qcd jets using similar techniques show a 30% improvement in jet resolution .",
    "b - tagging in run ii at cdf will be improved with the new ability to reconstruct three - dimensional tracks . extended coverage from @xmath64 ( run i ) to @xmath65 means improve b - jet and lepton acceptance . additionally , new triggers will also recover acceptance , including a displaced track trigger , and an improved multijet trigger .    with a new silicon detector , d0 will also be performing this search in run ii , expecting a 12% dijet mass resolution .",
    "both experiments perform a study of their expected sensitivity to @xmath57 in run ii , and obtain similar results@xcite .",
    "we present the d0 study here .",
    "d0 also uses a multijet trigger , requiring four jets , each with @xmath66 gev . to maximize sensitivity ,",
    "mass dependent @xmath34 cuts are made on the jets .",
    "at least 3 b tags are required .",
    "all mass combinations are plotted , and a 2.5@xmath67 @xmath28 mass window is used . with 2@xmath68 , d0 concludes that the tevatron is expected to exclude @xmath69 gev for @xmath33 at 95% cl , and a 5@xmath67 discovery for @xmath70 gev for the same @xmath0 .",
    "run i results of the search for @xmath48 at cdf are to be completed soon , and a first glimpse of run ii data is on the way .",
    "the run i search for @xmath57 derives lower mass limits for @xmath0 in excess of 35 . in run",
    "ii with both experiments searching for this decay mode , the tevatron is expected to exclude ( or make a discovery in ) a significant region of mssm parameter space .",
    "both experiments are optimistic about improvements from triggers , jet resolution , and b - tagging to make this search even stronger than the current projections .",
