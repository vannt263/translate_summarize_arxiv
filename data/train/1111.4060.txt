    "the search for alternative axiomatizations of quantum theory ( qt ) is an old topic that goes back to birkhoff and von neumann  @xcite .",
    "more recently , initiated by hardy s work  @xcite , there has been a wave of contributions taking a more operational and less mathematical approach  @xcite .",
    "each axiomatization emphasizes different definitorial aspects of qt , providing a new perspective from which to look at the physical content of the theory , and potentially improving our understanding of it and its relations to other theories .",
    "modifications and generalizations of qt are of interest in themselves , and could be essential in order to construct a theory of quantum gravity . some well - known modifications of qt which are based on straightforward alterations of its mathematical formalism  @xcite lead to inconsistencies  @xcite .",
    "but here we use a different method to obtain modifications and generalizations of qt which always provides consistent theories : we choose some desirable physical features of qt and classify all theories which satisfy them .",
    "this is a double - win project : if only qt satisfies the requirements then we obtain a new axiomatization for it ; on the contrary , if other theories also satisfy the requirements , then we obtain consistent alternative theories which still keep the physical features that we have chosen .",
    "this classificational approach has also been used in  @xcite .    in our journey beyond",
    "qt we do not want to go excessively far in theory space , so we keep within the framework of generalized probability theory  @xcite , which is based on operational notions .",
    "for instance , the state of a system can be represented by the probabilities of some pre - established measurement outcomes , which suffices to predict the probabilities for all measurements performable to that system . on top of this foundation ,",
    "the quantum features that we want to preserve are : _ continuous reversibility _ ( for every pair of pure states there is a continuous reversible transformation which maps one state onto the other ) and _ tomographic locality _",
    "( the state of a composite system is characterized by the statistics of measurements on the individual components ) .",
    "these two axioms were introduced in  @xcite and also considered in  @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations to assume the reversibility and continuity of time - dynamics is that the most fundamental theories that we know  classical or quantum  enjoy it .",
    "the axiom of tomographic locality has a well - defined operational meaning , but additionally , it is mathematically very natural , since it endows state - spaces of multipartite systems with the familiar tensor - product structure .    in this work",
    "we classify all continuously - reversible and locally - tomographic theories for bipartite systems where each subsystem has a state space with the geometry of the euclidean ball ( like the bloch ball of a quantum binary system but with its dimension not being necessarily equal to three ) .",
    "it turns out that in all such theories , with the exception of qt , binary systems do not interact , hence , they can not be entangled nor violate any bell inequality .",
    "these findings push forward the results obtained in  @xcite : the toy theory called box world , which violates all bell inequalities maximally , does not admit any entangling reversible dynamics .",
    "the requirement that a state space has the geometry of the euclidean ball does not look , at first sight , physically motivated . however , some axiomatizations of qt derive this fact from physical principles as an initial step  @xcite , before obtaining the full structure of qt . also , this fact is a consequence of each of the following proposed principles individually : information causality  @xcite ( see  @xcite ) , branch locality  @xcite , and  no information gain implies no disturbance \"  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we see the results in this paper as a kind of module which can be used in many derivations of quantum theory : as soon as a physical principle implies that the state space of a system is a euclidean ball , one can supplement this with tomographic locality and continuous reversibility , and use our results to get most of the structure of qt .    in mathematical language , the reversibility axiom is equivalent to the transitivity of the group of reversible dynamics when acting on the set of pure states . in other words ,",
    "the set of pure states is a compact homogenous space  @xcite , and the state space itself is an orbitope  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of our problem provides new ways to look at these mathematical objects , and opens new questions within the theories of homogenous spaces and orbitopes that are very relevant for the foundations of qt .",
    "in this section we explain the results without introducing the framework of generalized probability theory , which is left for section  [ axiomatization ] . in this work",
    "we only consider bipartite systems where each constituent is a binary system .",
    "a binary system contains two perfectly distinguishable states and no more , hence , it is the generalization of a quantum two - level system or qubit .",
    "states of two - qubit systems are represented by @xmath1 hermitian matrices @xmath2 that are positive , @xmath3 , and have unit trace @xmath4 .",
    "these can be written in the following basis @xmath5 , \\quad      \\sigma_2 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }           0 & -\\i \\\\",
    "\\i & 0      \\end{array}\\right ] , \\quad      \\sigma_3 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }           1 & 0 \\\\          0 & -1      \\end{array}\\right ] ,   \\quad      \\id = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }           1 & 0 \\\\          0 & 1      \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] that is @xmath6 hence , a two - qubit state @xmath2 is specified by the three vectors @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the condition @xmath3 translates to some algebraic constraints for @xmath10 .",
    "the reduced states for each of the qubits represented by ( [ rho ] ) are given by the partial traces @xmath11 the reduced states are characterized by the bloch vectors @xmath12 , which satisfy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the euclidean norm .",
    "local reversible transformations act on the state as @xmath15 \\rightarrow      \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc }           b & \\zm & \\zm \\\\",

    "\\bfc      \\end{array}\\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 , since @xmath17 is the adjoint action of @xmath18 .",
    "the matrix group corresponding to all reversible transformations of two qubits ( local and non - local ) is the adjoint action of @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "( see @xcite for a characterization . )",
    "product states are the ones such that @xmath21 , and as it is shown below , have no correlations .",
    "it is convenient to write product states and local transformations ( [ rev loc trans ] ) in tensor - product form ; this can be done by adopting the hat notation : @xmath22 , \\quad      \\hat a= \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }           1 & \\zm \\\\",
    "\\zm & a       \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the zero matrix ( or vector ) with dimensions specified by the context . in accordance with the claimed form of product states and local transformations , we get @xmath24 ,   \\quad      \\hat a \\otimes \\hat b =      \\left [ \\begin{array}{cccc }           1 & \\zm & \\zm & \\zm\\\\           \\zm & b & \\zm & \\zm\\\\           \\zm & \\zm & a & \\zm\\\\           \\zm & \\zm & \\zm & a \\otimes b\\\\       \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] note that here , the ordering of the components under the @xmath25-action is not the standard one .",
    "the redundant  1 \" in ( [ hat rep ] ) and ( [ hat rep 2 ] ) is equivalent to the redundant information that @xmath2 contains , since it obeys @xmath4 .",
    "a single - qubit projective measurement is characterized by a unit - length bloch vector @xmath26 ; the probabilities for the two corresponding outcomes `` @xmath27 '' and `` @xmath28 '' when the state is @xmath29 are @xmath30 for two - qubit systems , the joint probability of the local measurement outcomes @xmath31 is @xmath32.\\ ] ] as mentioned above , product states give product distributions , and hence no correlations .",
    "the above representation of two - qubit systems generalizes to a very natural family of theories for bipartite systems .",
    "these theories have arbitrary bloch dimension @xmath33 but still satisfy equations ( [ rev loc trans])-([joint prob ] ) with @xmath34 , @xmath13 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( below we also consider groups of reversible transformations which are proper subgroups of @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , what is not immediately clear , is how the set of non - product states and the set of non - local reversible transformations generalize .",
    "we address these two issues in the following paragraphs .",
    "one of the definitorial properties of these theories is that the state space of a subsystem has the geometry of a euclidean ball , that is , states can be represented by bloch vectors of arbitrary dimension ( @xmath39 with @xmath40 ) .",
    "one can see that these state spaces have two perfectly - distinguishable states and no more ( as with qubits)so we refer to them as binary systems .",
    "joint states for two binary systems are represented by vectors @xmath41 \\in                      \\reals^{1+d}\\otimes\\reals^{1+d},\\ ] ] which , according to equation  ( [ joint prob ] ) , must satisfy @xmath42      \\in [ 0,1]\\ , \\ ] ] for any bloch vectors @xmath31 .",
    "joint reversible transformations for two binary system are @xmath43 real invertible matrices , which map a state  ( [ generic state ] ) onto another state  ( [ generic state ] ) . since physical transformations can be composed , they form a group , denoted by @xmath20 . we consider theories where the sets of states and reversible transformations have related geometries , since we impose the following axiom .    * * continuous reversibility : * in each type of system , for every pair of pure states there is a continuous reversible transformation mapping one state onto the other .",
    "this was introduced in the axiomatization for qt given in  @xcite , under the name continuity axiom .",
    "the continuity of reversible transformations is suggested by the apparent continuity of time - evolution in the physical world .",
    "it means that every reversible transformation is part of a continuous one - parameter subgroup @xmath44 , where @xmath45 can be interpreted as time .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the group of reversible transformations is connected .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , classical probability theory violates this axiom , since the set of reversible transformations is the group of permutations which is not connected  .",
    "continuous reversibility implies that once the group of reversible transformations @xmath20 is given , the set of states  ( [ generic state ] ) is fixed , since the set of pure states is @xmath46 for any fixed @xmath39 with @xmath47 ; and the set of all states ( pure and mixed ) is the corresponding convex hull  @xcite .",

    "continuous reversibility applies to all types of systems , and in particular to a single binary system .",
    "the group of reversible transformations for a binary system , denoted by @xmath50 , comprises @xmath51 real matrices @xmath52 which map states to states ( @xmath53 ) , and map any point in the unit sphere to any other .",
    "table  [ groups trans ] in section  [ trans groups ] contains the list of all such groups , which consists of @xmath54 and some of its subgroups .",
    "following the hat notation  ( [ hat rep ] ) , we denote by @xmath55 the representation of @xmath50 which acts on the @xmath56-dimensional vector @xmath57 .",
    "the group of local transformations for two binary systems is @xmath58 , where the hat notation works as in  ( [ hat rep 2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , local transformations constitute a subgroup of general reversible transformations @xmath59 . except for this and  ( [ c1 ] ) the group @xmath20",
    "is totally unconstrained .    in summary ,",

    "as mentioned above , the adjoint action of @xmath70 corresponds to qt for a 4-level system .",
    "partially - transposed quantum theory and ( standard ) quantum theory are two representations of the same theory ; since there is a reversible linear map for states , transformations and effects mapping one theory onto the other .",
    "actually , in  @xcite , they show a generalization of result 2 for an arbitrary number of binary systems .",
    "results 1 and 2 imply that     _ the only theory from the family under consideration + which has interacting dynamics is qt . _",
    "in this section we axiomatize the family of theories under consideration . but before , we introduce a framework which allows to represent states , measurements and transformations independently of the theory that we are considering .      in classical probability theory there can always be a joint probability distribution for all random variables under consideration . in the framework of generalized probability theory  @xcite",
    "this is relaxed , by allowing the possibility of random variables that can not have a joint probability distribution , or can not be simultaneously measured ( like non - commuting observables in qt ) .    in this framework",
    ", a state can be represented by the probabilities of some pre - established measurement outcomes @xmath71 which are called _ fiducial _ :",

    "we include the possibility that the system is absent , indicated by the fact that a measurement gives no outcome , hence the state space contains the null vector @xmath73 .",

    "another example is a spin-@xmath75 particle in qt , where the fiducial probabilities can be @xmath76 $ ] , and the probability that the system is present is @xmath77 .",
    "note that in classical probability theory , all fiducial outcomes are simultaneously measurable , while in qt this is not the case .",
    "also , note that the set of fiducial outcomes need not be unique , since any three linearly independent spin directions characterize the state of the spin-@xmath75 particle .",
    "the set of all allowed states @xmath78 is convex @xcite , because if @xmath79 then one can prepare @xmath80 with probability @xmath81 and @xmath82 otherwise , effectively preparing the state @xmath83 .",

    "the probability of a measurement outcome @xmath85 when the system is in state @xmath86 is given by a function @xmath87 .",
    "suppose the system is prepared in the mixture , then the relative frequency of outcome @xmath85 should not depend on whether the label of the actual preparation @xmath88 is ignored before or after the measurement , hence @xmath89 this and the fact that when there is no state there is no outcome , @xmath90 , imply that @xmath91 is linear .",
    "linear functions mapping @xmath92 $ ] are called _ effects _ and can be written as a scalar product @xmath93 .",
    "one can always measure whether there is a system or not , by checking that a measurement gives one outcome .",

    "the _ pure states _ are the extreme points of @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "each type of system has associated to it : a state space @xmath78 , a set of measurements , and a set of transformations .",
    "a transformation is a map @xmath98 which , for the same reason as outcome probabilities , has to be linear .",
    "a transformation @xmath99 is reversible if its inverse @xmath100 exists and belongs to the set of transformations allowed by the theory .",
    "the set of reversible transformations of a particular state space @xmath78 forms a group @xmath50 .",
    "motivated by the physical interpretation , we assume that @xmath78 and @xmath50 are both topologically closed .    note that the geometry of the state space depends on the choice of fiducial outcomes .",
    "for example , the state space of a spin-@xmath75 particle in qt is a euclidean ball when the fiducial outcomes correspond to three orthogonal spin directions ; otherwise the state space becomes an ellipsoid .",
    "however , both geometries are related by a linear transformation .          to a setup like figure 1 we associate a system if , for each configuration of the preparation , transformation and measurement devices , the relative frequencies of the outcomes tend to a unique probability distribution . two systems",

    "naturally , system @xmath103 can be considered on its own or as part of a composite system @xmath102 , hence , for any state @xmath106 there is a state @xmath107 which has @xmath106 as its reduced state .",
