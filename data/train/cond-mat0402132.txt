    "the ziff - gullari - barshard(zgb ) model @xcite for the oxidation of carbon monoxide ( co ) on a catalytic surface exhibits phase transitions between an active steady state and absorbing or `` poisoned '' states , in which the surface is saturated either by oxygen ( o ) or by co. this model and its variants have stimulated much interest ; many studies of the zgb model have been published using deterministic mean - field equations @xcite and monte carlo simulations . for reviews see @xcite . ) in the present work we analyze quasi - stationary properties of the model . in the process , we revisit the one - site mean - field theory and formulate an improved version thereof .",

    "mean - field - like descriptions based on cluster approximations @xcite reproduce qualitatively the behavior of the system in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "large but finite systems appear to be stationary on any reasonable time scale ( away from the phase boundaries ) , but eventually end up in one of the absorbing states ( o - poisoned or co - poisoned ) , via a fluctuation with a very small , but nonzero probability .",
    "mean - field theories ignore such fluctuations , and so are incapable of treating finite systems . since simulations and other numerical methods usually study finite systems , it is useful to develop approximate theoretical descriptions that account for finite system size .",
    "experimental study of nanoscale catalytic systems is also of current interest @xcite .",
    "the notion of a quasi - stationary ( qs ) distribution has proved to be a powerful tool in this context . for such models ,",
    "the qs distribution describes the asymptotic ( long - time ) properties of a finite system conditioned on survival @xcite .",
    "the quasi - stationary properties converge to the stationary properties when the system size @xmath9 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite qs distributions ( qsd ) are derived for various continuous - time markov processes , e.g. , the contact process and the malthus - verhulst process . in ref .",
    "@xcite the qsd for a discrete - time process is derived , using the domany - kinzel cellular automaton as an example . in all of these studies ,",
    "mean - field - like approximations are used to find the qsd .",
    "previous studies have focused on continuous phase transitions to an absorbing state , with the exception of schlgl s second model @xcite , known to exhibit a discontinuous transition in mean field approximation , which was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to exhibit a bimodal qsd at the transition . such a bimodal distribution ( e.g. , of the order parameter ) is a hallmark of a discontinuous phase transition .",
    "the phase transition in schlgl s second model , with nearest - neighbor interactions , is however known to be _ continuous _ in @xmath10 dimensions @xcite .",
    "hence , aside from the particular interest of the zgb model in the context of catalysis , the present work presents a qs analysis of a model known to exhibit a discontinuous transition .",
    "the balance of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the mean - field theory for the zgb model at the site level , introducing modifications that take into account the prohibition against o - co nearest - neighbor ( nn ) pairs on the surface . in sec .",
    "iii , we define the qs probability distribution and show how to derive it in an efficient way . this method is used to generate the results reported in sec .",
    "iv ; results for the case of noninstantaneous reactions ( ni model ) are also presented .",
    "v contains a summary of our results .",
    "the appendix treats the zgb model on a complete graph .",
    "the simplest mean - field description of the zgb model is the site approximation . by assuming spatial homogeneity and neglecting all correlations between the occupancies of different sites , one obtains a closed description in terms of the co and o coverages , i.e. , the fraction of sites occupied by co(o ) . to simplify the notation , from this point",
    "we will denote a co molecule by @xmath11 , a vacant site by @xmath1 , and an o atom by @xmath12 .",
    "the coverages will be denoted by @xmath13 , for @xmath14 @xmath1 or @xmath12 , with the normalization @xmath15 .    in the zgb model reactions between adsorbed @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "are instantaneous , so that there is a strict prohibition against @xmath11-@xmath12 nn pairs .",
    "previous formulations of the site approximation @xcite effectively ignored this prohibition , leading to the appearance of an absorbing state in which a small fraction ( about 0.2% ) of the sites are occupied by @xmath12 , while the rest bear @xmath11 molecules .",
    "elimination of this nonphysical effect is one motivation for reformulating the approximation ; providing a systematic basis for the qs analysis is another . in the absence of any prohibitions ,",
    "the site approximation treats each site as statistically independent , so that the joint probability @xmath16 for a nn pair of sites to be in states @xmath17 and @xmath18 is @xmath19 .",
    "our problem is to formulate an approximation that treats sites as independent , _ except _ for the fact that @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath45 marks a spinodal point , the limit of stability of the active phase @xcite .",
    "the site approximation does not reproduce the o - poisoning transition , yielding @xmath46 .",
    "the present formulation is an improved version of the one - site approach presented in @xcite . in the latter formulation",
    "one finds @xmath47 , but , as noted , the final state ( for @xmath48 ) has a small admixture of @xmath12 in the @xmath11-poisoned phase , in contradiction to the prohibition against @xmath11-@xmath12 nn pairs .",
    "the present formulation eliminates this flaw and provides a slightly improved estimate for @xmath49 .    in the preceding discussion we consider the thermodynamic limit ( there is no reference to the system size ) .",
    "the model exhibits an active phase below the spinodal value @xmath50 . in finite systems",
    "it is not possible to avoid poisoning .",
    "but for large system sizes , we expect , for a range of @xmath4 , a long - lived metastable state , which we call the quasi - stationary state . increasing the system size , the lifetime of the qs state goes to infinity , and its properties become equivalent to that of true active stationary state . in the next section we use the qs probability distribution in order to study finite systems .",
    "the dynamics of a stochastic process such as the zgb model is governed by a master equation ( me ) for the probabilities in state space ; the latter consists of all possible configurations of the system . since the transition rates of the model do not satisfy detailed balance",
    ", one can not determine the steady - state probability distribution without solving the me .",
    "we may write a simplified me , based on a cluster approximation , which , depending on the truncation level , includes certain fluctuations .    in the simplest case , one truncates the me at the site level .",
    "this means that the state of the system is specified by the site occupation numbers @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 , without regard to the relative positions of the adsorbed species on the surface .",
    "( evidently , the fluctuations preserved at this level are those in the total occupancy . )",
    "consider a square lattice of @xmath22 sites , so that @xmath51 .",
    "the state of the zgb model in the site approximation is given by the pair @xmath52 ; the model defines a markov chain in the @xmath11-@xmath1 plane ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , with @xmath53 , etc .",
    "the o - poisoned and co - poisoned ( absorbing ) states are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .    in the site approximation , the probability distribution @xmath56 follows the me    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the transition rate . in terms of the zgb rates shown in table 1",
    ", we have : @xmath59    in eq .",
    "( [ me1site ] ) it is understood that each of the @xmath60 is to be evaluated for the same values as the associated probability factor ( that is , in the first term , @xmath39 must be evaluated for @xmath61 , etc . ) .",
    "`` poisoning '' in the zgb model corresponds to the system falling into one of the absorbing states ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this means that , for a finite system , the stationary probability distribution is nonzero only for absorbing configurations , that is , @xmath62 ( the weight @xmath63 depends on @xmath22 , @xmath4 , and the initial distribution . )",
    "we introduce the qsd via the hypothesis that , as @xmath64 , the probability distribution _ conditioned on survival _ attains a time - independent form .",
    "then the qs probability distribution @xmath65 is given by    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the _ survival probability _ , i.e. , the probability that the system has not fallen into the absorbing state up to time @xmath68 . in the appendix , we present results on the qs distribution for the zgb model on a _ complete graph _ , which admits an exact description in terms of a single variable .",
    "one method for generating the qsd is by integrating the master equation until the distribution @xmath69 , ( with @xmath70 ) attains a time - independent form . for moderately large systems ( @xmath71 ) , standard schemes such as the fourth - order runge - kutta method @xcite ,",
    "require long integration times , because a small time step is needed to avoid numerical instabilities .",
    "an alternative method is available @xcite , based on writing the evolution in the form :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 and @xmath74    suppose the probability distribution has attained a qs form at some time @xmath68 . using normalization , @xmath75 and eq .",

    "we have @xmath81    which suggests the following iteration scheme : @xmath82    where @xmath83 is a parameter and @xmath84 is evaluated using the distribution @xmath56 the new distribution @xmath85 must be normalized after each iteration . in this way",
    ", one can construct the qs state from any normalized initial distribution @xmath56 .",
    "this _ iterative method _ exhibits good convergence for @xmath86 .",
    "we construct the qs distributions for the zgb model at the one - site level , via both the runge - kutta method and the iterative scheme , which as expected yield the same qs distribution . using @xmath86",
    ", we find that the iterative method converges to the qs distribution about 100 times faster than via the rk method using the same precision .",
    "this gain in efficiency is associated with the small time step required to maintain numerical stability in the rk scheme . in fig .",
    "2 , we show a typical qs distribution , @xmath65 , for the zgb model near the spinodal point .",
    "it is clearly bimodal , with one maximum at @xmath87 , near the co - poisoned state , and another , broader one that corresponds the active state .",
    "figure 3 shows the time evolution of the coverages ( conditioned on survival ) , for two different initial conditions , and @xmath4 fixed at the spinodal value @xmath50 obtained from the mf theory of sec .",
    "it is clear that , although the relaxation to the qs values is very different in the two cases , both reach reach the same qs coverages .",
    "the relaxations to the qs state for @xmath88 and @xmath89 are compared in fig .",
    "4 ( since the iterative method provides only the qs distributions , the evolution is calculated via the runge - kutta method in this case . )",
    "it is also possible to discuss qs properties for @xmath90 , where an active stationary state does not exist , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a finite - size effect , analogous to a nonzero magnetization in the ising model above the critical temperature , on a finite lattice .",
    "this effect was also reported for the contact process on a complete graph @xcite .    the marginal qs distribution @xmath91 ( fig .",

    "one of many possible extensions for the zgb model that have been proposed relaxes the condition of instantaneous reactions between adsorbed o and co. @xcite .",
    "the key difference between this ni model and the zgb model is that there is no longer any prohibition against @xmath11-@xmath12 nn pairs .",

    "this value is different from the spinodal found in the site - approximation for the zgb model , which involves instantaneous reactions . since @xmath112 ,",
    "the limit of infinite reaction rate is singular .",

    "the maximum lifetime ( i.e. , varying @xmath4 ) tends to a finite value , different from that from the original zgb model , when @xmath118 .",
    "this is because the flux to the absorbing configurations , which determines the lifetime of the qs state , and which , in the site approximation , is given by @xmath119 , is reduced as @xmath105 increases , since the latter reduces the qs probabilities @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    figs . 9 and 10",

    "as @xmath105 increases the transition becomes progressively  harder , \" i.e. , the coverage @xmath115 just below the transition approaches zero while that just above approaches unity .",
    "in the limit @xmath118 , the @xmath11 coverage is a step - function : @xmath122 . as before",
    ", the qs coverages tend to the macroscopic curves ( furnished by mean - field theory ) when @xmath9 . due to the low @xmath11 coverage in the active phase for large @xmath105 , the moment ratios @xmath101",
    "differ strongly from those of the zgb model .",
    "but as always , the peak in @xmath101 tends to the spinodal as @xmath93 ( see fig .",
    "we study the quasi - stationary properties of the zgb model for the catalytic oxydation of co , and of a related model with noninstantaneous reactions .",
    "the qs distribution is constructed numerically via a bivariate extension of the iterative method @xcite . for the simple case of a complete graph",
    ", we obtain exact ( numerical ) results for qs properties .",
    "although our analysis of the models with nn reactions on a square lattice is based on site - approximations , which can not capture critical fluctuations , the approach allows one to put some fluctuations `` back into '' mean - field theory , specifically , fluctuations in the overall coverages , since we assume spatial homogeneity .",
    "this enables us to investigate finite - size effects and moment ratios that are out of reach with other approaches .",
    "we derive a revised site approximation for the zgb model that respects the prohibition against @xmath11-@xmath12 nn pairs , eliminating the inconsistency noted in previous formulations @xcite , while providing a reasonably good estimate of the spinodal point .",
    "the present study confirms two fundamental properties of the zgb and ni models : ( 1 ) the discontinuous phase transition is signaled by a bimodal qs probability distribution ; ( 2 ) the lifetime of the qs state grows exponentially with system size , in the reactive phase .",
    "the latter implies that the system will typically spend a long time in the qs state , following a relatively brief transient , except near the spinodal , where relaxation slows down .",
    "we have also noted sharply increased values of the moment ratios @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the vicinity of the transition . since the co@xmath2 production rate is closely related to @xmath103 , one should expect to observe large fluctuations in product concentrations in the gas phase , as the spinodal is approached .",
    "one may envision using these fluctuations as part of a control scheme that adjusts the co partial pressure ( represented by the parameter @xmath4 in the models ) , to optimize production while avoiding poisoning .",
    "an interesting result is that at the level of mean - field theory , the zgb model is not equivalent to the infinite - reaction - rate limit of the model with noninstantaneous reactions .",
    "the zgb model is characterized by the constraint that any @xmath11-@xmath12 nn pair react before any further adsorption events , a condition that is also realized in the ni model , for sufficiently large @xmath105 .",
    "mean - field theory is however incapable of representing this situation , since , in the absence of a prohibition against @xmath11-@xmath12 pairs , the ni model in the @xmath113 limit simply prohibits simultaneous nonzero coverages of o and co. since truly instantaneous reactions do not exist , one might suppose that the ni model , with an appropriately large rate @xmath105 , provides the correct description of fast ( but not instantaneous ) surface reactions . in mean - field approximation",
    "however , the large-@xmath105 limit of the ni model appears _ less realistic _ than the zgb model , which permits simultaneous presence of adsorbed o and co. in this sense , the choice of model in the description of cooperative kinetics should involve the approximation that one intends to use , not only the intrinsic nature of the model .",
    "qs analysis promisses to be a useful technique in the study of catalysis models on nanometer scales @xcite .",
    "possible directions for future work include the study of metastability via qs distributions , and monte carlo simulations of the qs state , in catalytic models and other processes exhibiting absorbing states .      a _",
    "complete graph _ is one in which all sites are neighbors .",
    "when formulated on such a structure , a stochastic lattice model defines a stochastic process defined by one or a few variables , thereby permitting an exact analysis , as in the case of the contact process @xcite .",
