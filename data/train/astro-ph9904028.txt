    "the stage leading up to dynamic collapse of a magnetically subcritical cloud core to a protostar or a group of protostars is believed to be largely quasi - static , if the responsible process is ambipolar diffusion ( e.g. , mestel & spitzer 1956 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to describe the transition between quasi - static evolution by ambipolar diffusion and dynamical evolution by gravitational collapse",
    ", @xcite introduced the idea of a pivotal state , with the scale - free , magnetostatic , density distribution approaching @xmath8 for an isothermal equation of state ( eos ) when the mass - to - flux ratio has a spatially constant value , a condition that @xcite and @xcite termed `` isopedic '' .",
    "numerical simulations of the contraction of magnetized clouds justify the assumption of a nearly constant mass - to - flux ratio in the pivotal core .. outside the starred point , the mass - to - flux value exhibits greater variation , but this occurs only because @xcite impose starting values for the mass - to - flux in the envelope that are @xmath9 times the critical value ( see also figs . 4a and 8b in @xcite ) . such small ratios for the bulk of the mass of a molecular cloud are probably ruled out by the zeeman oh measurements summarized by crutcher ( 1998 ) . ]    the small dense cores of molecular clouds that give rise to low - mass star formation are effectively isothermal ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". the situation may be different for larger regions that yield high - mass or clustered star formation .",
    "it has often been suggested that the eos relating the gas pressure @xmath10 to the mass density @xmath11 of interstellar clouds can be represented by a polytropic relation @xmath12 with negative index @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite pointed out the utility of this idealization within the context of the classic two - phase model of the diffuse interstellar medium [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] , while @xcite published extensive tables analyzing the stability of non - magnetized , self - gravitating spheres of such gases .",
    "@xcite examined the linewidth - size and density - size relations of molecular clouds , first found by @xcite and subsequently studied by many authors [ e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "maloney pronounced the results consistent with the properties of negative index polytropes . for a polytropic eos , the sound speed @xmath13 increases with decreasing density if @xmath14 .",
    "the latter behaviour may be compared with the empirical linewidth - density relation for molecular clouds , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 for low - mass cores ( @xcite ) and @xmath17 for high - mass cores ( @xcite ) , implying that @xmath0 lies between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , or that a static @xmath20 lies between @xmath21 and 0.7 .",
    "the case @xmath22 is of particular relevance for the equilibrium properties of molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite found that the pressure of alfvn waves propagating in a stratified medium , @xmath23 , a consequence of conservation of the wave energy flux @xmath24 .",
    "this result was later derived more rigorously by @xcite in the wkb approximation for mhd waves propagating in mildly inhomogeneous media , and , more recently by @xcite and @xcite in a specific astrophysical context . in numerical simulations of the same problem",
    ", @xcite found indication of a much shallower relation ( @xmath25 ) for a self - gravitating medium supported by nonlinear alfvn waves . on the other hand , for the adiabatic contraction of a cloud supported by linear alfvn waves",
    ", @xcite found a dynamic @xmath26 larger than 1 .",
    "@xcite confirmed a similar behaviour in numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse of clouds with an initial field of hydrodynamic rather than hydromagnetic turbulence .    in the limit of @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) , the eos becomes `` logatropic , '' @xmath29 , a form first used by @xcite to mimic the nonthermal support in molecular clouds associated with the observed supersonic linewidths .",
    "the sound speed associated with the nonthermal contribution , @xmath30 becomes important at the low densities characteristic of molecular cloud envelopes ( as contrasted with the cloud cores ) since the thermal contribution is independent of density if the temperature @xmath31 remains constant .",
    "this nonthermal contribution decreases with increasing density and will become subsonic at high densities as recently observed in the central regions of dense cores ( @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite",
    "have modeled the equilibrium and collapse properties of unmagnetized , self - gravitating , spheres with a pure logatropic eos and claim to find good agreement with observations .",
    "adams , lizano , & shu ( in 1987 ) independently obtained the similarity solution for the gravitational collapse of an unmagnetized singular logatropic sphere ( sls ) , but they chose not to publish their findings until they had learned how to magnetize the configuration in a nontrivial way ( see the reference to this work in fuller & myers  ( 1992 ) , who considered the practical modifications to the protostellar mass - infall rate introduced by `` nonthermal '' contributions to the support against self - gravity ) .",
    "magnetization constitutes an important program to carry out if we try to justify a nonthermal eos as the result of a superposition of propagating mhd waves ( see also holliman & mckee 1993 ) . in this paper , we extend the study of li & shu ( 1996 ) to include the isopedic magnetization of pivotally self - gravitating clouds with a polytropic equation of state . as a by - product of this investigation , we obtain the unanticipated and ironic result that the only way to magnetize a singular logatropic configuration and maintain a scale - free equilibrium is to do it trivially , i.e. , by threading the sls with straight and uniform field lines ( see  6 ) .",
    "a basic consequence of treating the turbulence as a scalar pressure , coequal to the thermal pressure except for satisfying a different eos , is that we do not change the basic topology of the magnetic field .",
    "this assumption may require reassessment if mhd turbulence enables fast magnetic reconnection ( @xcite ) and allows the magnetic fields of highly flattened cloud cores ( mestel & strittmatter 1967 , @xcite ) or pseudodisks ( @xcite ) to disconnect from their background .",
    "recent mhd simulations carried out in multiple spatial dimensions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) find turbulence in strongly magnetized media to decay almost as fast as in unmagnetized media .",
    "such decay may be responsible for accelerating molecular cloud core formation above simple ambipolar diffusion rates ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although this result also cautions against treating turbulence on an equal footing as thermal pressure , we attempt a simplified first analysis that includes magnetization to assess the resulting configurational changes when we adopt an alternative eos for the pivotal state .",
    "in particular , different power - law dependences of the radial density profile translate immediately to different time dependences in the mass - infall rate for the subsequent inside - out collapse ( @xcite , mclaughlin & pudritz  1997 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we formulate the equations of the scale - free problem and show that each solution depends only on the polytropic exponent @xmath6 and a nondimensional parameter @xmath5 related to the cloud s morphology . in ",
    "3 we present the numerical results . in  4 ,  5 , and  6",
    "we discuss the limiting form of the solutions .",
    "finally , in  7 we give our conclusions and discuss the possible implications of our results for star formation and the structure of giant molecular clouds .",
    "to begin , we generalize the singular polytropic sphere in the same way that @xcite generalized the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) . in the absence of an external boundary pressure , the only place the pressure @xmath10 enters in the equations of magnetostatic equilibrium is through a gradient .",
    "consider then the polytropic relation @xmath32 by integrating equation ( [ dpdrho ] ) we recover for @xmath33 the isothermal eos , @xmath34 , ( where @xmath35 is the square of the isothermal sound speed ) and for @xmath36 the logatropic eos , @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt axial symmetry in spherical coordinates and consider a poloidal magnetic field given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the magnetic flux .",
    "force balance along field lines requires @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gravitational potential and @xmath42 is the bernoulli `` constant '' along the field line @xmath43 constant .",

    "figures  1 and 2 demonstrate that for @xmath105 ( the logatropic limit ) , @xmath5 is not a measure of the strength of the magnetic fields since @xmath106 diverges as @xmath107 ( see  5 below )",
    ".    for fixed @xmath6 , a sequence from small @xmath5 to large @xmath5 progresses through configurations of increasing support by magnetic fields , as demonstrated explicitly for the isothermal case by @xcite .",

    "the equilibria have nearly spherically symmetric isodensity contours and weak quasiuniform magnetic fields that provide little support against gravity . with increasing @xmath5",
    ", the pivotal configurations flatten . the case @xmath109 is already quite disklike : the pole to equator density contrast is @xmath110 . for a thin disk ,",
    "the analysis of @xcite demonstrates that magnetic tension provides virtually the sole means of horizontal support against self - gravity , with gas and magnetic pressures being important only for the vertical structure . in the limit of a completely flattened disk ( @xmath111 ) ,",
    "@xmath112 independent of the detailed nature of the gas eos ( see next section ) .",

    "since the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath1 is a fundamental quantity that will not change unless magnetic field is lost by ambipolar diffusion , in figure  4 we consider sequences where @xmath1 is held fixed , but @xmath6 is varied .",
    "this figure shows the locus of the set of equilibria with @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) plane .",
    "equilibria with @xmath115 are highly flattened when @xmath105 even for small but fixed values of @xmath5 ( see  6 ) .",
    "in fact , to obtain incompletely flattened clouds when one takes the limit @xmath105 , one also needs simultaneously to consider the limit @xmath116 .",
    "unfortunately , because both the density and the strength of the magnetic field at the midplane diverge as the equilibria become highly flattened , we are unable to follow numerically the limit @xmath105 to verify if these sequences of constant @xmath115 will hook to a finite value in the @xmath5 axis , or will loop to @xmath117 , consistent with our demonstration in  4 that flattened disks do not exist in the logatropic limit . or large @xmath5 , it becomes necessary to determine the constants of the expansions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 near the origin with prohibitively increasing accuracy . ]",
    "we speculate that the results for @xmath115 have the following physical interpretation . according to the theorem of shu & li ( 1997 ) ,",
    "only if @xmath118 itself rather than @xmath1 is less than unity , the magnetic field is strong enough overall to prevent the gravitational collapse of a highly flattened cloud .",
    "however , for moderate @xmath5 and @xmath6 when @xmath115 , even the singular equilibria are probably magnetically subcritical , since there can be little practical difference between the spherical mass - to - flux ratio @xmath1 and the `` true '' mass - to - flux ratio @xmath118 for highly flattened configurations .",
    "the latter is formally infinite when @xmath119 only because the mass column goes to zero a little slower than the field column when we perform an integration along the central field line ( see footnote 3 ) . in this interpretation ,",
    "scale - free clouds with @xmath115 and intermediate values of @xmath6 can become highly flattened because magnetic tension supports them laterally against their self - gravity while the soft eos does not provide much resistance in the direction along the field lines .",
    "the squeezing of the cloud toward the midplane is compounded by the _ confining _ pressure of bent magnetic field lines that exert pinch forces in the vertical direction .",
    "both the magnetic tension and the vertical pinch of magnetic pressure disappear when the field lines unbend , as they must to maintain the scale - free equilibria in the limit @xmath105 ( see below ) . as a consequence ,",
    "logatropic configurations become spherical for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "we leave as an interesting problem for future elucidation the determination whether there is still a threshold in @xmath1 below which the sls , embedded with straight and uniform field lines , will not collapse dynamically .",

    "consequently , the density function @xmath179 also diverges in @xmath198 , and the configuration again approaches a thin disk threaded by an uniform , infinitely strong , magnetic field .",
    "we conclude that scale - free logatropic clouds can not exist as magnetostatic disks except in some limiting configuration . in the absence of such limits , the equilibria are spherical and can be magnetized only by straight and uniform field lines ; i.e.",
    ", the magnetic field is force - free and therefore given by @xmath59 .",
    "the inside - out gravitational collapse of such a sls would still proceed self - similarly as in the solution of mclaughlin & pudritz ( 1997 ) , but the frozen - in magnetic fields would yield a dependence with polar angle that eventually produces a pseudodisk ( galli & shu 1993a , b ; allen & shu 1998a ) .",
    "we have solved the scale - free equations of magnetostatic equilibrium of isopedic self - gravitating polytropic clouds to find pivotal states that represent the initial state for the onset of dynamical collapse , as first proposed by @xcite for isothermal clouds .",
    "compared to unmagnetized equilibria , the magnetized configurations are flattened because of magnetic support across field lines .",
    "the degree of this support is best represented by the ratio of the square of the sound to alfvn speeds @xmath82 , or the overdensity parameter @xmath74 , since they are always monotonic functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "configurations with @xmath33 become highly flattened as the parameter @xmath5 increases . when @xmath104 ( softer eos ) the equilibria get flattened even faster at the same values of @xmath5 , since along field lines there is less support from a soft eos than for a stiff one .",
    "however , it seems that in the logatropic limit flattened disks do not exist : the singular scale - free equilibria can only be spherical uniformly magnetized clouds .",
    "figure  7 shows a schematic picture of the @xmath199 plane indicating the topology of the solutions for scale free magnetized isopedic singular self - gravitating clouds .    in self - gravitating clouds , the joint compression of matter and field",
    "is often expressed as producing an expected relationship : @xmath200 , with different theorists expressing different preferences for the value of @xmath201 ( e.g. , mestel 1965 , fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ) .",
    "no local ( i.e. , point by point ) relationship of the form @xmath202 holds for the scale - free equilibria studied in this paper . however , if we average the magnetic field strength and mass density over ever larger spherical volumes centered on @xmath203 , we do recover such a relationship : @xmath204 , where angular brackets denote the result of such a spatial average and @xmath205 .",
    "we may think of the result @xmath206 as arising physically from a combination of two tendencies .",
    "( a ) slow cloud contraction in the absence of magnetic fields and rotation tends to keep roughly one jeans mass inside every radius @xmath68 , which yields @xmath207 , or @xmath208 if @xmath209 . ( b )",
    "slow cloud contraction in the absence of gas pressure tends to keep roughly one magnetic critical mass inside every radius @xmath68 , which yields @xmath210 = constant , or @xmath211 if gas pressure ( thermal or turbulent ) plays a comparable role to magnetic fields in cloud support .",
    "notice that our reasoning does not rely on arguments of cloud geometry , e.g. , whether cloud cores flatten dramatically or not as they contract ; nor does it depend sensitively on the precise reason for core contraction , e.g. , because of ambipolar diffusion or turbulent decay .",
    "crutcher ( 1998 ) claims that the observational data are consistent with @xmath212 .",
    "if we take crutcher s conclusion at face value , we would interpret the observations as referring mostly to regions where the eos is close to being isothermal @xmath213 , which is the approximation adopted by many theoretical studies that ignore the role of cloud turbulence .",
    "the result is not unexpected for low - mass cloud cores , but we would not naively have expected this relationship for high - mass cores and cloud envelopes , where the importance of turbulent motions is much greater .",
    "unfortunately , the observational data refer to different clouds rather than to different ( spatially averaged ) regions of the same cloud , so there is some ambiguity how to make the proper connection to different theoretical predictions .",
    "there may also be other mechanisms at work , e.g. , perhaps a tendency for observations to select for regions of nearly constant alfvn speed , @xmath214 constant ( bertoldi & mckee 1992 ) .",
    "thus , we would warn the reader against drawing premature conclusions about the effective eos for molecular clouds , or the related degree to which observations can at present distinguish whether molecular clouds are magnetically supercritical or subcritical .    if molecular clouds are magnetically supercritical , with @xmath1 greater than 1 by order unity ( say , @xmath215 ) , then an appreciable fraction ( say , 1/2 ) of their support against self - gravity has to come from turbulent or thermal pressure ( elmegreen 1978 , mckee et al . 1993 ,",
    "crutcher 1998 ) . modeled as scale - free equilibria ,",
    "such clouds with @xmath82 of order unity are not highly flattened ( see tables 1 , 2 and figs . 2 , 3 ) .",
    "suppose we try gravitationally to extract a subunit from an unflattened massive molecular cloud , where the cloud as a whole is only somewhat supercritical , @xmath216 . if the subunit s linear size is smaller than the vertical dimension of the cloud by more than a factor of 2 , which will be the case if we consider subunits of stellar mass scales , then this subunit will not itself be magnetically supercritical .",
    "magnetically subcritical pieces of clouds can not contract indefinitely without flux loss , so star formation in _ unflattened _ clouds , if they are not highly supercritical , needs to invoke some degree of ambipolar diffusion in order to produce small dense cores that can gravitationally separate from their surroundings .    on the other hand ,",
    "if molecular clouds are magnetically critical or subcritical , with @xmath217 , then almost all scale - free equilibria are highly flattened , with @xmath82 appreciably less than unity . on a small scale , any subunit of this cloud , even subunits with vertical dimension comparable to the cloud as a whole ,",
    "would also be magnetically critical or subcritical .",
    "for such a subunit to contract indefinitely , we would again need to invoke ambipolar diffusion to make a cloud core magnetically supercritical .",
    "thus , although the decay of turbulence can accelerate the formation of cloud cores , the ultimate formation of stars from such cores may still need to rely on _ some _ magnetic flux loss ( but perhaps not more than a factor of @xmath218 ) to trigger the evolution of the cores toward gravomagneto catastrophe and a pivotal state with a formally infinite central concentration .    on the large scale ,",
    "if gmcs are modeled as flattened isopedic sheets , @xcite proved that magnetic pressure and tension are proportional to the gas pressure and force of self - gravity .",
    "their theorems hold independently of the detailed forms of the eos or the surface density distribution . if gmcs are truly highly flattened  with typical dimensions , say , of 50 pc @xmath219 50 pc @xmath219 a few pc or even less  then many aspects of their magnetohydrodynamic stability and evolution become amenable to a simplified analysis through the judicious application and extension of the theorems proved by @xcite ( e.g. , see allen & shu 1998b , @xcite ) .",
    "this exciting possibility deserves further exploration .",
