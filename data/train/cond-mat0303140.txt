    "the energy gain in a superconductor compared to the normal state at the same @xmath1 , smoothly increases below @xmath2 and at @xmath3 reaches @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the volume , @xmath6 is the superconducting gap and @xmath7 is the fermionic density of states",
    ". @xcite the decrease in the total energy upon pairing results from a fine competition between an increased kinetic energy and a decreased potential energy , both of which are much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "the bcs condensation energy can be experimentally extracted from the jump of the specific heat at @xmath2 as within the bcs theory @xmath8 .",
    "since the fermionic density of states is only weakly dependent on doping , the application of the bcs formula for the condensation energy to cuprate superconductors would imply that @xmath0 and @xmath9 scale in the same way . however , the measured gap increases monotonically with decreasing doping  @xcite , while the jump of the specific heat has a non - monotonic doping dependence . in the overdoped regime",
    "it initally increases with reduced doping , but below optimal doping further underdoping leads to a _ decrease _ in the specific heat jump @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between the trends in @xmath10 and in @xmath6 as functions of doping clearly makes the applicability of the bcs formula to the cuprates questionable .    in view of this fact , and the general consensus that the cuprates are strongly coupled systems",
    ", it comes as no surprise that effort has already been made to explain the cuprate condensation energy as a result of non - bcs physics .",
    "scalapino and white  @xcite conjectured that at strong coupling , the dominant contribution to the condensation energy comes from a feedback effect on the magnetic excitations of the system .",
    "on the other hand , norman  _ et al _ argued  @xcite that the condensation energy likely has an electronic origin , and is driven by a gain in the kinetic energy which at strong coupling is negative ( in contrast to bcs theory ) because of a strong `` undressing '' of fermions which bear a greater resemblance to free particles in the superconducting state than they do in the normal state .",
    "similar ideas were expressed by hirsh and marsiglio  @xcite .",
    "a different idea , related to the lowering of the coulomb energy in the superconducting state has been proposed by leggett  @xcite .    in this communication",
    "we argue that these apparently disparate viewpoints are in fact consistent with each other , and describe the same strong coupling physics .",
    "we argue that at strong coupling , the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath6 is qualitatively different from bcs theory and is consistent with the experimental trends in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "we show furthermore that the strong coupling effects are in large part the result of mutual feedback between the fermions and bosons .",
    "we make the case that the contributions to the condensation energy from these two channels may not be considered independently from each other , and that only the sum of the two contributions has physical meaning .",
    "our point of departure is the general equation for the free energy of an interacting electron system , derived by luttinger and ward  @xcite for the normal state and extended to a superconductor by eliashberg  @xcite .",
    "we first review strongly coupled phonon superconductors .",
    "we discuss the validity of the eliashberg formula and describe the bcs , bardeen - stephen @xcite and wada @xcite expressions for the condensation energy ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the bcs expression neglects both bosonic and fermionic self - energies ( apart from a trivial renormalization of the dispersion ) .",
    "the bardeen - steven and wada expressions include the fermionic self - energy and its change between the normal and the superconducting states , but neglect the feedback from superconductivity on phonons .",
    "the two expressions are generally considered to be identical , however we argue that this is only true as long as the feedback from fermions onto phonons is neglected .",
    "we review bardeen and steven s arguments for the validity of this approximation for phonon superconductors .",
    "we next modify the eliashberg equation for @xmath0 to the case of magnetically mediated superconductors .",
    "we argue that in qualitative distinction to the phonon case , the feedback effect from the superconductivity onto the bosons may not be neglected if the pairing is magnetic .",
    "we derive the relevant equations and explicitly compute @xmath11 assuming that the pairing is due to spin - fluctuation exchange and is described by the spin - fermion model .",
    "we show that when the feedback on bosons is non - negligible , the calculations require care as both electronic and spin parts of the condensation energy are ultraviolet divergent .",
    "we explicitly show that these divergencies are cancelled out between the two terms , and the total @xmath0 ( which turns out to be the only physically meaningful quantity ) is free from divergencies .",
    "we furthermore demonstrate that one can avoid the divergencies by performing the computations in real frequencies .",
    "we apply the results to the cuprates and show that our theoretical @xmath0 agrees with the data both in magnitude and in the doping dependence .",
    "we view this agreement as a support for the spin - fluctuation scenario for the cuprates .",
    "the condensation energy @xmath0 is the difference between the free energies in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "@xmath12 in the greens function technique one evaluates the grand free energy @xmath13 .",
    "the difference @xmath14 coincides with @xmath15 provided that the chemical potential @xmath16 does not change between the two states . in the eliashberg theory that we will be using , this is the case as the fermi energy is assumed to be much larger than @xmath6 , and the corrections to @xmath16 due to pairing , which scale as powers of @xmath17 , are neglected  @xcite .",
    "there are two ways to compute @xmath0 using green s functions .",
    "the first approach is to use the general formula for the ground state energy of the interacting fermionic system in terms of the integral over the running coupling constant  @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the free energy for free fermions , @xmath20 is the full self - energy , and @xmath21 is the full green s function .",
    "both are functions of a 4 vector of momentum and matsubara frequency @xmath22 and the running coupling constant @xmath23 .",

    "still , we tried this formalism , and will discuss the results in the appendix a. the approach which we will be using in the bulk of the paper was suggested by luttinger and ward  @xcite who demonstrated that it is possible to re - express @xmath13 in the normal state via a series of closed linked skeleton diagrams with fully dressed fermionic and bosonic propagators .",
    "their approach was extended to the superconducting state by eliashberg @xcite .",

    "its use for the calculation of @xmath0 takes into account not just the introduction of the pairing vertex @xmath42 but also changes in the fermionic self energy @xmath20 and the polarization bubble @xmath43 .",
    "thus it calculates the contributions to @xmath0 from both the fermions _ and _ bosons .",
    "the approximations made in the phonon case are associated with the smallness of the sound velocity @xmath44 compared to the fermi velocity @xmath45 .",
    "it turns out that higher order closed linked diagrams form series in powers of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the dimensional coupling constant which scales with @xmath48 ( see below ) .",
    "the approximation , attributed to migdal  @xcite and eliashberg  @xcite , is to neglect @xmath49 terms without assuming that @xmath47 is by itself small .",
    "this would imply neglecting all terms labled as dots in ( [ phononom ] ) .",
    "the physics behind the migdal - eliashberg approximation is best revealed by analyzing the perturbation series for @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these series can be separated into terms that scale as powers of @xmath47 and terms that scale as powers of @xmath46 .",
    "the perturbative series in powers of @xmath46 arises from the actual electron - phonon scattering , and the factor @xmath52 results from the fact that in this process electrons are forced to vibrate at phonon frequencies far from their own resonance .",
    "this gives rise to vertex corrections ( at typical pairing frequencies ) , and to an equal renormalization of fermionic @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. the quasiparticle residue is renormalized , but the quasiparticle mass remains a bare one .",
    "the vertex correction diagrams for @xmath55 and @xmath51 , embedded into the closed linked diagrams , gives rise to higher - order skeleton diagrams for the free energy , and it is these diagrams which are dropped .",
    "the terms that form series in @xmath47 are different and they are not considered to be small . in the normal state , they can be understood as coming from phonon - induced interactions between electrons and their own zero - sound collective modes .",
    "these terms do not contribute to the vertex renormalization ( at typical frequencies for the pairing ) , and gives rise to a @xmath50 that only depends on frequency .",
    "the @xmath56 terms also contribute to the pairing problem and in the superconducting state give rise to @xmath51 that again depends only on frequency .    neglecting the higher order skeleton diagrams",
    ", eliashberg obtained the closed - form expression for @xmath57 given in eq .",
    "[ phononom ] .",
    "the closed form , coupled equations for the fermionic self - energy @xmath58 and the pairing vertex @xmath59 then follow from the condition that @xmath60 given by ( [ phononom ] ) is stationary with respect to variations in @xmath55 and @xmath51 .",
    "the conditions @xmath61 yield @xmath62 the migdal - eliashberg approximation has two further implications .",
    "first , the fermionic dispersion may be approximated by @xmath63 , as typical pairing frequencies should be much smaller than @xmath64 if @xmath65 is to be small .",
    "second , the momentum integration over @xmath66 can be factorized : the integration over momenta transverse to the fermi surface involves only normal and anomalous fermionic propagators , via @xmath54 , while the integration along the fermi surface involves only the bosonic propagator in which one can set @xmath67 , i.e. , deviations from the fermi surface are neglected leading to a bosonic propagator dependant only on frequency",
    ". corrections to this approximation again scale as @xmath46 .",
    "finally , it is assumed ( without justification ) that the fermi surface is isotropic in the sense that @xmath45 is considered to be independent of @xmath68 . under these approximations ,",
    "the momentum integration in the equations for @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be performed exactly . approximating the momentum sum by an integral over energy and an associated density of states @xmath71 as @xmath72 ,",
    "inserting equations [ greensfunctions ] into equation [ 2ndord ] and performing the integration we obtain @xmath73    an essential feature of the above equations is that apart from the assumption of the smallness of @xmath46 , it is assumed assumed that the phonon polarization bubble @xmath74 , which accounts for the effects of the electrons on phonons , may be neglected .",
    "analagously to the derivation of equation [ 2ndord ] , an expression for @xmath74 can be formally obtained from the feature that @xmath60 given by ( [ phononom ] ) is also stationary with respect to variations in @xmath74 .",

    "@xmath77 reflecting the decay of a low - energy bosonic mode into a fermionic particle - hole pair .",
    "this decay term obviously can not be neglected at the lowest frequencies as it accounts for the leading low - frequency dependence of @xmath78 .",
    "i.e. for an einstein phonon , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the debye frequency ( we recall that @xmath78 is dimensionless , hence @xmath81 at the lowest frequencies . however , for @xmath82 , the frequencies relevant to the pairing problem are of order @xmath80 , typical momenta are of order @xmath83 , and hence @xmath74 at typical frequencies is small to the same extent as @xmath46 and other similar terms in the eliashberg theory . in the superconducting state",
    ", the low - energy phonons are gapped , and at frequencies smaller than @xmath6 , @xmath84 this difference between @xmath74 in the normal and superconducting states reflects a fundamental change in the bosonic dynamics at small frequencies due to the gapping of low - energy fermionic excitations . still , however , at typical frequencies for the pairing , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and the polarization operator can be neglected compared to the bare phonon propagator .",
    "this was shown explicitly by bardeen and stephen  @xcite who evaluated the contribution to @xmath0 from the change of the bosonic dynamics between normal and superconducting states and demonstrated that in the phonon problem the bosonic piece in @xmath0 is small compared to the electronic piece and hence can be safely neglected .",
    "we will see below that neglecting the bosonic contribution to @xmath0 is _ not _ a justifiable approximation if one is dealing with magnetic superconductors where the bosonic mode is a collective mode of the fermions .",
    "this is the main difference between phonon and magnetic superconductors , and we will examine this issue in the next section .",
    "for completeness , we present several useful forms for @xmath87 and @xmath0 for the phonon case . for simplicity , we assume that the electron - phonon coupling is independent of frequency , and the phonon spectrum consists of a single einstein boson with a frequency @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89    integrating over momentum in eq .",
    "( [ phononom ] ) as before , we obtain @xmath90 where we introduced @xmath91 .",

    "we obtain @xmath96 thus we see that the free energy for a phonon superconductor is dependent only upon the form of the gap @xmath97 and is not explicitly upon the self energy @xmath98 .",
    "a comment is in order here .",
    "the luttinger - ward result for the free energy as a series of closed linked skeleton diagrams is , strictly speaking , only valid for the minimum of @xmath13 , i.e. , for the self - energy that satisfies the stationary condition .",
    "otherwise , the luttinger - ward generating functional ( which is what they actually calculated ) does not necessarily coincide with the free energy . in the normal state , this does not cause a problem with eq .",

    "if this is the case , then eq . [ phononsoln2 ] can be used for the study of the profile of the free energy , i.e. how it evolves for different solutions of the gap . in particular",
    ", we verified that for the bcs case , the expansion of eq . [ phononsoln2 ] near @xmath102 to order @xmath9 yields the sign change of the slope at exactly the bcs transition temperature @xmath2 .",
    "for the remainder of this communication , we will only be considering @xmath13 evaluated at the equilibrium solution of @xmath97 when the applicability of the luttinger - ward formalism is rigorously justified . to this end , the eliashberg equation for the equilibrium solution @xmath97 may be obtained by minimizing equation [ phononsoln2 ] with respect to @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath107 let us clearly state what the wada expression calculates .",
    "it is the strong coupling result for the condensation energy at thermodynamic equlibrium , under the assumption that there are no appreciable changes in the bosonic mode between the normal and superconducting states . in other words ,",
    "it accounts for the appearance of the pairing vertex , as well as any changes to the fermionic self energy , but ignores any feedback effects between bosons and fermions .",
    "an equivalent expression for @xmath0 , more advantageous for numerical calculations due to a faster convergence at high frequencies was obtained by bardeen and stephen  @xcite .",
    "they noticed that there exists an integral relation between @xmath108 and @xmath109 @xmath110 that in turn is the consequence of the fact that @xmath111 as both quantities can be re - expressed as a cross - product @xmath112 using equation ( [ relation ] ) , bardeen and stephen obtained the following expression for @xmath113 .",
    "@xmath114 the practical importance of bardeen - stephen result is that at high frequencies , when @xmath115 , the integrand in ( [ bardeen ] ) behaves as @xmath116 , and the frequency summation rapidly converges .",
    "this makes the bardeen - stephen expression more convenient for numerical computations than wada s expression .",
    "we emphasize again that the equivalence of the two forms for @xmath0 is the consequence of the fact that in the phonon case , the change of the bosonic self - energy @xmath117 between normal and superconducting states can be neglected , and the accuracy of this approximation is governed by the same parameter @xmath46 as the accuracy of the eliashberg theory . in the next section we show that this is _ not _ the case for spin mediated pairing .",
    "we will see that for superconductors with an electronic pairing mechanism , the feedback on the pairing boson plays a crucial role , and the wada s expression for @xmath0 would give competely erroneous results .",
    "instead , the full expression [ phononom ] must be used .",
    "we pause now to connect with the bcs result for the condensation energy .",
    "bcs is a weak coupling theory .",
    "it assumes that the only change between the normal and superconducting states is the introduction of the pairing vertex @xmath42 which is given by the bcs gap @xmath6 .",
    "( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the fermionic and bosonic self energies are both taken to be negligable .",
    "the bcs condensation energy is therefore calculated from the wada equation with the substitution @xmath119 .",
    "taking the zero temperature limit we obtain after some simple algebra @xmath120 this is the result that we already cited in the introduction .",
    "we also see that the frequency integration in ( [ bcs1 ] ) is confined to @xmath121 , i.e. , the condensation energy comes from fermions in a narrow region around the fermi surface .",
    "although this result looks rather straightforward , the issue of which fermions contribute to the condensation energy in the bcs case is nontrivial , and we discuss it in detail in appendix b.",
    "we now proceed to the case of _ magnetically _ mediated pairing .",
    "the bosonic mode that mediates the pairing is now the low - energy spin susceptibility .",
    "the luttinger - ward formalism , which deals with an arbitrary bosonic mode is still valid , i.e. , the free energy has the same form as in eq .",

    "we begin by briefly discussing the validity of the eliashberg approximation for anti - ferromagnetically mediated superconductivity and how the assumptions inherent in the luttinger - ward condensation energy formalism are justified . for the purposes of calculating the condensation energy ,",
    "there are two main issues to be discussed .",
    "first , as with phonons , it is possible in the spin - fermion model to separate the perturbative series such that the terms resulting from vertex corrections and higher order diagrams are `` small '' and therefore irrelevant .",
    "second , since the effects of pairing are greatest near `` hot spots '' ( points on the fermi surface connected by @xmath156 ) one can invoke an effective _ momentum independence _ for the problem , while still retaining the @xmath155 pairing symmetry .",
    "we briefly emumerate the reasoning leading to the above conclusions here .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in ref.@xcite .    1 .",
    "spin fluctuations are collective modes of fermions , hence there is no difference between the fermi velocity and the spin velocity , i.e. , @xmath157 . then @xmath158 , i.e. , there is no way to separate perturbative series based on the difference between velocities . from this perspective",
    ", there is no migdal theorem for spin fluctuations , and the perturbation theory with the _ bare _ spin propagator just holds in powers of the coupling @xmath47 .",
    "the absence of small @xmath52 implies in turn that the polarization operator @xmath159 is not negligible , as it is for phonons , but is rather dominant for @xmath160 .",
    "the consequence of this is that one must simultaneously solve for both the fermionic and bosonic self - energies .",
    "3 .   in the normal state ,",
    "@xmath161 at low frequencies , i.e. , when @xmath162 dominates the frequency dependence of the spin susceptibility ( strong coupling ) , spin fluctuations become diffusive .",
    "this transmutation of the spin dynamics from propagating with @xmath157 for @xmath163 to diffusive for @xmath154 implies that at strong coupling bosons become soft compared to electrons .",
    "such softness of bosons , is precisely the physics behind the migdal theorem .",
    "not surprisingly then , the diagramatic series for fermionic @xmath55 obtained with a diffusive bosonic propagator again can be separated into two different subsets of terms : one set of terms now scales as powers of @xmath164 instead of powers of @xmath47 , and the reduction of the expansion parameter is a direct consequence of the softness of bosons compared to fermions . as for phonons , the series in @xmath164 gives rise to vertex corrections and to the renormalization of the quasiparticle residue .",

    "although magnetically mediated superconductors are often compared to dirty superconductors , we point out that at @xmath3 , the physics of the two is already qualitatively different .",

    "however , in a dirty superconductor with non - magnetic impurities , the condensation energy retains its bcs form despite of the fact that the superfluid stiffness is renormalized down  @xcite . obviously , this is not what we found .",
    "as we stated in the introduction , several groups have argued  @xcite that the condensation energy is driven by a gain in the kinetic energy which at strong coupling is negative ( in contrast to bcs theory ) because of a strong `` undressing '' of fermions which bear a greater resemblance to free particles in the superconducting state than they do in the normal state .    in this section",
    "we consider , within our model , the change in the kinetic energy when the system enters the superconducting state .",

    "as the first term in @xmath213 is equal to @xmath337 ( see eqs .",

    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:3 ] shows that this is just another way to interpret strong coupling effects that affect _ both _ the fermionic and bosonic propagators via mutual feedback .",
    "= 3.2 in    a simple explanation of why this is so is the following . in the superconducting state , the spin decay into fermions is forbidden at energies smaller than @xmath338 .",
    "this _ simultaneously _ gives rise to two effects .",
    "first , the spin propagator develops the excitonic ( resonance ) peak at @xmath339 .",
    "the energy released by the creation of an exciton results in a gain in the magnetic part of the condensation energy .",
    "secondly , the fermions can not decay until their frequency exceeds @xmath340",
    "( this is the magnetic analog of the holstein effect ) .",
    "the elimination of fermionic scattering at low frequencies implies that the fermionic self - energy @xmath69 in the superconducting state is reduced compared to that in the normal state .",
    "this lowers the kinetic energy .",
    "obvously , the two effects ( the gain in the magnetic part and the lowering of the kinetic energy ) come from the same physics .",
    "our goal in this paper was to emphasize the importance of taking all contributions to the condensation energy into account when considering a strongly coupled superconductor . specifically , we considered the case of @xmath155 pairing mediated by the exchange of near - critical overdamped antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "we demonstrated that although eliashberg theory is valid for a strongly coupled magnetic superconductor , the reason for its validity is qualitatively different from that for phonon superconductors as the spin velocity and fermi velocity are of the same order . due to this fact ,",
    "approximations appropriate for phonon superconductors are generally _ not _ valid in magnetic superconductors .",
    "specifically , we demonstrated that the assumption that the bosonic polarization bubble can be neglected , which was rigorously justified by bardeen and stephen for phonon superconductors , breaks down for magnetically - mediated superconductors and makes the wada and bardeen - stephen formalisms invalid .",
    "we obtained the full expression for the condensation energy within the spin - fermion model and showed that the spin and electronic parts of the condensation energy are of the same order @xmath341 and both depend only on the dimensionless coupling @xmath47 .",

    "the condensation energy is highly non - bcs .",
    "the electronic contribution to the condensation energy is _ positive _ , while the spin part is negative and larger in magnitude than the electronic part which makes the full @xmath0 negative . as in the bcs limit",
    "the electronic condensation energy is negative and equal to @xmath342 , this implies that the electronic condensation energy changes sign at a rather small @xmath47 .",
    "we found that at large @xmath47 , both the spin and the electronic parts of the condensation energy nearly saturate . as a result",
    ", the full condensation energy flattens at @xmath318 , and decreases at large couplings despite the fact that the pairing gap increases monotonically with @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is very counterintuitive from a bcs perspective , where the condensation energy scales with @xmath9 and is also inconsistent with the behavior of @xmath0 in dirty superconductors .",
    "this behavior results from the fact that there is a substantial cancellation between the spin and electronic parts of the condensation energy and the total @xmath0 is thus substantially smaller than either the spin or electronic parts .",
    "we argued that the reduction of @xmath0 at large coupling is likely the result of the fact that at strong coupling the pairing is predominantly due to an energy conserving exchange of on - shell ( real ) bosons as opposed to the bcs theory in which the pairing is caused by the energy non - conserving exchange of virtual bosons .",
    "the reduction of @xmath0 at strong coupling also indicates that in this limit coherent superconductivity becomes fragile , and a large @xmath6 only indicates that the system needs a finite energy to destroy spin singlets .    finally , we computed the kinetic energy and found that at strong coupling it is negative which indicates that at high couplings the change in the self - energy due to the `` undressing '' of fermions , which lowers @xmath325 overcomes the effect of particle - hole mixing which tends to increase @xmath325 .",
    "this behavior has no analog for phonon superconductors .",

    "however , our results show that the lowering of @xmath0 may be thought of as being due to either the the lowering of the kinetic energy , _ or _ the interplay between the lowering of @xmath343 and the increase of @xmath213 .",
    "both explainations are valid interpretations of the strong coupling effects which affect the fermionic and bosonic propagators via mutual feedback .    by taking into account _ all _ contributions to the self energy , and taking @xmath344 as typical for near optimally doped cuprates",

    "we caution , however , that the relation between @xmath0 and the amount of the jump in the specific heat at @xmath2 , from which the experimental @xmath0 was extracted may be more complex than in the bcs theory which was used to extract @xmath0 from the data .",

    "the condensation energy can then be straightforwardly obtained by simply averaging both the normal and anomalous terms in ( [ a1 ] ) expressing the average products of the pairs of operators in terms of frequency integrals of normal and anomalous freen functions , and taking care to avoid double counting of the anomalous term , we obtain the zero temperature result @xmath388 where @xmath389 we know that the correct result is @xmath390 . however , a naive integration treating both @xmath225 and @xmath391 in ( [ a3 ] ) on an equal footing , results in a vanishing integral .",

    "the physical implication of this result is that in the bcs theory , the condensation energy can be equally viewed as coming from the energy levels near the fermi surface , as implied in eq .",

    "the gap vanishes at infinite frequency , the integrals are convergent , and the condensation energy can only be viewed as coming from the levels near the fermi surface .",
    "the peculiar nature of the bcs limit also explains the apparent sign difference between the expressions for the condensation energy in refs .",

    "the authors of ref  @xcite , on the other hand , assumed that the condensation energy is not due to phonons , and that @xmath136 is nearly zero , as in the near optimally doped cuprates .",
    "they argued that in this situation , the condensation energy should be given solely by the first term in ( [ aaa1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath420 where @xmath421 is the quasiparticle spectral function .",
    "this expression has opposite sign compared to eqn ( [ aaa2 ] ) .",
    "still , the authors of ref.@xcite argued that their expression also reproduces the bcs result @xmath419 .",
    "the consideration in the previous subsection of this appendix shows that both expressions are correct in the bcs limit ( despite the fact that the one is minus the other ! ) .",
    "the way in which the condensation energy was obtained in ref @xcite implies that the momentum and frequency integral must be physically motivated , i.e. , if the momentum integral over @xmath422 is extended to infinite limits , one has to integrate first over momentum and then over frequency .",
    "on the contrary , the wada expression for the condensation energy implies that the momentum integral comes first , and the frequency integration comes second . as we already know , in the bcs limit , interchanging the order of the integration changes the result by a factor @xmath423 .",
    "this explains why the two apparently opposite results for @xmath0 actually yield the same condensation energy .",
    "a comparison of the two results shows that that in the bcs limit , the change in the ion kinetic energy merely sets the proper regularization of the ultraviolet divergent integral for @xmath0 .",
    "if one regularizes the integral by restricting the momentum integration to @xmath424 ( this is what we called the physically motivated regularization ) , the ion kinetic energy may be completely neglected .",
    "reversing the ordering of the integration is equivalent to imposing a constraint on the frequency integral .",
    "this constraint can only come from the frequency dependence of the phonon propagator , i.e. , from the kinetic energy of ions .",
    "obviously in this situation , the ion kinetic energy can not be neglected .",
    "away from the bcs limit , the correct way to proceed in the general case is to use the luttinger - ward - eliashberg expression for free energy , eq .",
    "( [ phononom ] ) .",
    "this expression is valid for arbitrary @xmath172 and it also includes the full feedback on bosons . note that the expression for @xmath13 is more general than the eliashberg theory for phonon superconductivity as eqn ( [ phononom ] ) actually does nt assume that @xmath20 depends only on frequency , and that one can factorize the momentum integration in the expressions for the self - energy and the pairing vertex , eqs ( [ 2ndord ] ) .",
    "the only approximation in the eliashberg formula is the neglect of vertex corrections ( which account for higher - order terms labled by dots in ( [ phononom ] ) ) .",
    "still , it is of interest to understand which of the two expressions for @xmath0 , eqn [ aaa2 ] or [ aaa3 ] , one should use for the situation where the feedback effect on the bosonic propagator can , for one reason or another , be neglected .",
    "we argue that the answer depends on whether the self - energy predominantly depends on @xmath68 or on @xmath53 .",
    "indeed , in the bcs limit , the physical motivation for the ordering of the momentum and frequency integrations ( first over frequency and then over @xmath54 ) was associated with the fact that , for a constant gap , the ultraviolet divergence of the momentum and frequency integral for @xmath0 was cut by that the integration over @xmath54 can not extend to @xmath425 .",
    "suppose now that the eliashberg theory is valid , i.e. , @xmath426 , and @xmath417 .",
    "as we already said , this @xmath427 vanishes above some characteristic frequency @xmath428 which decreases when fermion - boson coupling increases .",
    "once this frequency becomes smaller than @xmath400 , the cutoff of the ultraviolet divergence is provided by the frequency integral , rather than momentum integral . in this situation ,",
    "the physically motivated ordering of the integrations should be integration over @xmath54 first ( in infinite limits ) , and the integration over frequency afterwards",

    "in this situation , the ionic kinetic energy can be neglected , and eqn .",

    "<S> we consider the condensation energy , @xmath0 of strongly coupled , magnetically - mediated superconductors within the context of the spin - fermion model . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that although experimentally obtained values of @xmath0 are of the same order of magnitude as would be expected from bcs theory in optimally and overdoped cuprates , this agreement is coincidental . the actual physics behind the condensation energy is much richer . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we argue that it is vital to take both the fermionic and bosonic contributions to the condensation energy into account when considering such materials , and that it is only the sum of the two contributions , @xmath0 , which has physical meaning . both the experimental and our theoretically calculated condensation energies exhibit a _ decrease _ with further underdoping past optimal doping , e.g. in the mid to strong coupling regime . below optimal doping , </S>",
    "<S> the physics is qualitatively different from bcs theory as the gain in the condensation energy is a result of the feedback on spin excitations , while the fermionic contribution to @xmath0 is positive due to an `` undressing '' feedback on the fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the same feedback effect accounts for a gain in the kinetic energy at strong coupling . </S>"
