    "the data points of the three low - metallicity galaxies ( ngc  1569 , ngc  4214 and ngc  6822 ) follow closely the same distribution as the combined data set of the higher metallicity galaxies m51 and m81 ( green triangles and blue diamonds , respectively ) . the hii  regions of ngc  6822 , representing the lowest luminosities , show a larger scatter than the rest of the hii  regions",
    ". a possible reason could be the fact that the surface brightness of the hii  regions in ngc  6822 is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the surface brightness of the hii  regions in the other objects . in order to search for differences as a function of metallicity",
    "we have derived a linear fit including the hii  regions of the high metallicity galaxies ( m51 and m81 ) and the ulirg sample of alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) yielding : @xmath8 the slope of this fit is similar to the linear fit obtained by calzetti et al .",

    "in the inner plot of fig",
    ".  [ lumi ] ( top panel ) we show the residuals of the 24@xmath0 m  luminosity ( i.e. the difference between the logarithm of the measured 24@xmath0 m  luminosity and the logarithm of the expected luminosity from the linear fit given in eq .  1 ) _ versus _ the metallicity of each hii  region . for m81 and m51",
    "we estimate the metallicity of the hii  regions using the metallicity gradients of each galaxy derived by pilyugin et al ( 2004 ) . for the hii  regions in m51",
    "we derive a metallicity variation of @xmath90.1dex for the radial range of their galactocentric radius , and therefore we adopt the central metallicity value for all of them . for the rest of the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ lumi ] ( top panel ) , there is no appreciable metallicity gradients ( see references in table  1 ) .",
    "no trend with metallicity is visible , with the mean of the residuals for the hii  regions of each galaxy being practically constant over the whole metallicity range .",
    "thus we conclude that , within the metallicity range investigated here , the relation between the 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  luminosities of hii  regions shows no dependence on metallicity .",
    "the situation changes when the integrated galaxy luminosities are considered . in fig .",
    "[ lumi ] ( bottom panel ) we compare the data for hii  regions with the integrated luminosities of the galaxy sample of table  1 , which includes dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and ( u)lirgs with high metallicities . for these additional galaxies , data for individual hii  regions",
    "is not available .",
    "we find a trend that low metallicity galaxies fall below the linear fit shown in eq .  1 , whereas the high metallicity galaxies follow it . in the inner plot of this figure",
    "we show again the residuals of the 24@xmath0 m  luminosity ( with respect to the fit of eq .  1 ) _ versus _ the metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "a trend of lower metallicity galaxies to have a lower ratio of measured - to - expected values is visible , with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 .",
    "we expect that the uncertainties in the extinction correction of the h@xmath1  fluxes will not change this trend for two reasons : the low metallicity dwarf galaxies , uncorrected for internal extinction , would be located even further away from the regression fit if we had applied an internal extinction correction , which would further emphasize the observed trend .",
    "the rest of the galaxies ( except m81 and m51 ) show only small uncertainties in the adopted extinction values .",
    "the higher uncertainties in the case of m81 and m51 is not able to change the general trend observed in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "it is surprising that the relation between the 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  luminosities for individual hii  regions does not show any dependence on metallicities for the range investigated here ( galaxies with metallicities between 12+log(o / h ) = 8.1 and 8.9 ) .",
    "a possible reason might be the existence of a lower threshold for the accumulation of dust in hii regions in order to support sfrs as large as the ones measured in our hii regions ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 yr@xmath12 ) .",
    "this would result in the dust content of hii regions being independent of the global metallicity of the entire galaxy .",
    "support for this hypothesis comes from a detailed study of the balmer decrement in the major hii  regions of ngc  1569 ( relao et al .",
    "2006 ) , where locally a high intrinsic extinction ( a@xmath13mag ) was found , in spite of the low metallicity of this galaxy .",
    "further studies for higher and lower metallicity galaxies are needed to show how far the universality of the relation between the 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  luminosity extends .",
    "the situation is very different for the ism outside the hii  region , the diffuse ism , which we take into account when considering the 24@xmath0 m  and h@xmath1  emission integrated over the entire galaxy . here , the 24@xmath0 m  emission depends directly on the dust content and opacity and hence on the metallicity .",
    "recently , calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) studied the relation between the 24@xmath0 m  and the extinction corrected pa@xmath1  surface densities of the star forming regions in a sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "they found a slight trend for hii  regions of low - metallicity galaxies to have a lower 24@xmath0 m  emission for a given pa@xmath1  surface density than higher metallicity regions .",
    "their use of a fixed aperture size for the hii  regions in all galaxies migh have included some diffuse emission , especially for distant galaxies .",
    "this would explain the similarity of their results and ours for the integrated emissions .",
    "a deeper analysis of the results presented in this letter , including a larger sample of hii  regions and separating clearly the diffuse emission from the emission coming from the hii  regions is needed ( relao et al . in prep . ) .",
    "we have studied the role of the metallicity in the use of the 24@xmath0 m   luminosity as a sfr indicator by analyzing the data for a sample of dwarfs and spirals covering a wide range of metallicities .",
    "we found that the extinction corrected h@xmath1  and the 24@xmath0 m  luminosities correlate tightly for all hii  regions , independently of the global metallicity of the galaxy .",
    "this demonstrates that the 24@xmath0 m  luminosity is a good tracer of the _ local _ sfr , independent of the metallicity .",
    "this is not the case when considering the integrated emission of galaxies . in this case ,",
    "metal  rich galaxies present a higher 24@xmath0 m   luminosity for a given h@xmath1  luminosity than low metallicity galaxies .",
    "our results indicate that the 24@xmath0 m  luminosity can be used as a sfr tracer when taking into account : ( i ) whether the emission from hii  regions or the integrated emission from entire galaxies is considered , and ( ii ) the metallicity of the galaxy .",
