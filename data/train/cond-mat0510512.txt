    "mass transport models encompass a large class of systems wherein ` mass ' , or some conserved quantity , is transferred stochastically from site to site of a lattice .",
    "well known examples of such models are the zero - range process ( zrp ) @xcite , and the asymmetric random average process ( arap ) @xcite .",
    "these are simple fundamental models which have been used to describe such diverse physical situations as traffic flow @xcite , clustering of buses @xcite , phase separation dynamics @xcite , force propagation through granular media @xcite , shaken granular gases @xcite and sandpile dynamics @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the zrp and related models and applications see @xcite .",
    "condensation is manifested in such models when , in the steady state , a finite fraction of the total mass condenses onto a single lattice site . at low global mass densities",
    "the system is in the fluid phase where the mass is distributed evenly over all sites . here , the single site mass distribution @xmath2 typically decays exponentially with @xmath3 implying a finite amount of mass at each site with the mean being the global mass density @xmath4 . on increasing the global density above a critical value , @xmath5 ,",
    "an extra piece of @xmath2 emerges which represents the condensate i.e. a single site which contains the global excess mass @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the system size .",
    "thus in the condensed phase the condensate coexists with the background fluid .",
    "note that the condensation occurs in real space and , in principle , in any number of dimensions . in this paper",
    "we will analyse in detail the structure of the condensate , elucidating when it occurs , its shape and its fluctuations .",
    "a short communication of some of our results has been given in @xcite .",
    "in general mass transfer models form examples of systems exhibiting nontrivial nonequilibrium steady states . since the models are defined by stochastic dynamical rules , their steady state distributions are not a priori known .",
    "however it turns out that a large class of models , which we shall discuss below , enjoy the convenient property of having a factorised steady state .",
    "this means that the steady state probability @xmath7 of finding the system with mass @xmath8 at site 1 , mass @xmath9 at site 2 etc is given by a product of ( scalar ) factors @xmath10  one factor for each site of the system  i.e. @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a normalisation which ensures that the integral of the probability distribution over all configurations containing total mass @xmath13 is unity , hence @xmath14 \\,\\delta \\!\\left ( \\sum_{l=1}^lm_l - m\\right ) \\;.   \\label{z}\\ ] ] here , the @xmath15-function has been introduced to guarantee that we only include those configurations containing mass @xmath13 in the integral .",
    "the single - site weights , @xmath16 are determined by the details of the mass transfer rules .",
    "thus when the steady factorises , the analysis of condensation reduces to the evaluation of ( [ z ] ) , a problem first addressed in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ z ] ) defines a canonical partition function in that the delta function imposes the constraint of fixed total mass @xmath13 . as we shall discuss in detail below analysis of ( [ z ] )",
    "has only been carried out in the fluid phase and effectively in the grand canonical ensemble where the total mass is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "our aim here is to present a full analysis of ( [ prob],[z ] ) in the canonical ensemble .",
    "in particular this shall elucidate the mechanism of condensation within factorised steady state .",
    "although our focus in this paper is on the analysis of the steady state ( [ prob],[z ] ) , it is relevant to briefly review some particular models and dynamics which give rise to such steady states , and previous studies of condensation phenomenon .",
    "firstly we mention the backgammon model @xcite where unit masses hop under dynamics respecting detailed balance with respect to an energy function which is simply minus the number of unoccupied sites in the system .",
    "when the temperature @xmath17 a condensate , where all masses are on the same site , dominates the steady state .",
    "since the model and dynamics are constructed so that an energy functions exists , the steady state automatically factorises into the form ( [ prob],[z ] ) ( but with discrete mass variables ) .",
    "the motivation for the backgammon model was actually to study a simple model for glassy dynamics since in the late time regime at low @xmath18 entropic barriers and slow dynamics arise .",
    "in @xcite the factorised steady state of the backgammon model was generalised to the form ( [ prob],[z ] ) with single - site weights @xmath16 that could have an asymptotic power law dependence @xmath19 it was shown that a condensation transition would occur if @xmath20 .",
    "mean - field dynamics for this general factorised steady state were constructed from the detailed balance condition and the mean - field dynamics of condensation was studied in @xcite . here `",
    "mean field ' is used in the sense that a particle can hop from a given site to any other .",
    "on the other hand it has long been known that the zrp , a stochastic model defined by _",
    "stochastic dynamics and without respect to any energy function , has a factorised steady state @xcite . in a heterogeneous system , where the rules for mass transfer depend on the site , the condensation may occur at the site with lowest outgoing mass transfer rate @xcite . in this case",
    "the mechanism for condensation ( in real space ) is exactly analogous to bose - einstein condensation in momentum space in an ideal bose gas and the slowest site plays the role of the ground state in the quantum system .    for homogeneous dynamical rules for the transfer of mass , which we will focus on in this work , the condensation mechanism in the zrp was first studied , to our knowledge , in @xcite where the zrp was used as an approximate description of a model of bus routes .",
    "it was shown that if the hop rate @xmath21 for a mass to move from a site with @xmath3 masses to its neighbouring site decays as @xmath22 then the single - site weight decays as ( [ f(m ) ] ) so that a condensation transition occurs if @xmath20 .",
    "condensation in the zrp has been further studied in @xcite .",
    "another model with a factorised steasy state is the arap @xcite .",
    "although usually this does model does not exhibit condensation , condensation may be induced by imposing a maximum threshold on the amount of mass that may be transferred between sites @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the zrp and arap may be unified by considering a very general class of one - dimensional mass transport models@xcite : a mass @xmath23 resides at each site @xmath24 ; at each time step , a portion , @xmath25 , chosen from a distribution @xmath26 , is chipped off to site @xmath27 . choosing the chipping kernel @xmath26 appropriately recovers the zrp , the arap and the chipping model of  @xcite .",
    "moreover the class of models encompasses both discrete and continuous time dynamics and discrete and continuous mass .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for a factorised steady state is that the chipping kernel is of the form@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary non - negative functions .",
    "then the single site weight is given by @xmath31 this result may be generalised to arbitrary lattices in all dimensions @xcite .",
    "given a chipping kernel @xmath26 , sometimes it is hard to verify explicitly that it is of the form ( [ ffact ] ) and thereby to identify the functions @xmath21 and @xmath32 in order to construct the weight @xmath16 .",
    "this problem was circumvented by devising a test  @xcite to check if a given explicit @xmath26 satisfies the condition ( [ ffact ] ) or not .",
    "further , if it `` passes this test , '' the weight @xmath16 can be found explicitly  by a simple quadrature @xcite . finally , for any desired function @xmath16 , one can construct dynamical rules ( i.e. , @xmath33 s ) that will yield @xmath16 in a factorised steady state .",
    "condensation has also been noted and studied in mass transport models without factorised steady states . in the chipping model defined in @xcite all the mass at a site",
    "can move to a neighbouring site .",
    "condensation in the model was studied in a mean - field approximation for the steady state which amounts to approximating the true ( unknown ) steady state by the factorised form ( [ prob],[z ] ) .",
    "it turned out that in the true steady state condensation is actually only observed in the case of symmetric hopping @xcite . however a generalisation which includes both the chipping model and zrp as special cases does appear to exhibit condensation for asymmetric hopping @xcite .",
    "finally we mention more complicated condensation scenarios such as the two species zrp @xcite where , for example , one species may induce condensation in the other .",
    "so far we have reviewed models exhibiting condensation which comprise hopping particles .",
    "condensation phenomena have also been observed in the context of the rewiring dynamics of networks with a fixed number of nodes and links @xcite . there",
    "the condensate corresponds to a node which is ` hub ' which captures a finite fraction of the links .",
    "also , models of macroeconomies may exhibit ` wealth condensation ' where the wealth is the conserved quantity and condensation corresponds to a single individual capturing a finite fraction of the wealth@xcite .",
    "a further important application of the condensation mechanism is to determine a criterion for phase separation in one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "phase separation , or indeed the lack of it , has been reported in a number of one - dimensional and `` quasi-1-d '' systems typically involving three species of charged particles with an exclusion interaction @xcite . by mapping the domains between the neutral particles onto the sites of a zrp",
    ", the zrp can be used as an effective description of domain dynamics and the criterion for condensation in this effective description determines when phase separation will or will not occur .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : gce ] we review the grand canonical approach which correctly predicts the critical density , but does not shed light on the nature of the condensate . before embarking on the canonical analysis we interpret in section  [ sec : rv ] the canonical partition function in the framework of sums of random variables and deduce rather quickly some key properties of the condensate . in section  [ sec : nat ]",
    "we summarise the results of the full canonical analysis which are detailed in sections  [ sec : exact ] and [ sec : cangen ] : in section  [ sec : exact ] we present an exactly solvable case where a closed expression can be found for the canonical partition function and in section  [ sec : cangen ] the asymptotic analysis of the canonical partition function in the general case is presented . in section  [ sec : oc ] we consider other forms of @xmath16 such as ( [ f(m ) ] ) with @xmath34 for which condensation does not occur , and stretched exponential @xmath16 for which condensation does occur but with some differences .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "assuming that the steady state of mass transport model is of the factorised form ( [ prob],[z ] ) , one next turns to the issue of condensation within this factorised steady state .",
    "in particular , we ask : ( i ) when does a condensation transition occur , i.e. , the criterion for condensation ( ii ) if condensation occurs , what is the precise nature of the condensate ?",
    "the factorization property allows ( i ) to be addressed rather easily within a grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) framework  an approach similar to the one used in traditional bose - einstein condensation in an ideal gas of bosons , though there are some important differences in the present case . in this approach",
    "one takes the thermodynaimc limit ( @xmath35 with fixed _ overall _ density @xmath36 ) .",
    "then ( [ prob ] ) becomes a product measure state where the sites are decoupled from each other and the single site mass distribution is simply given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the negative of the chemical potential and is chosen to fix the density , giving rise to the relation @xmath39 the criterion for condensation can be derived easily by analysing the function @xmath40 defined in eq .",
    "( [ cp1 ] ) .",
    "the behavior of @xmath41 depends on @xmath16 .",
    "we consider three cases separately .    1 .",
    "first consider the case when @xmath16 decays faster than exponential for large @xmath3 . in this case , @xmath38 is allowed to take any value in @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath40 is monotonic in @xmath38 , ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath4 , one can always find a suitable @xmath38 to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ cp1 ] ) and there is no condensation .",
    "2 .   we next consider the case when @xmath16 decays slower than @xmath45 for large @xmath3 . in this case , the allowed range of @xmath38 is @xmath46 $ ] , in order that the integrals in ( [ cp1 ] ) converge .",
    "the function @xmath40 diverges as @xmath47 , and then decreases monotonically to @xmath48 as @xmath49 . once again , for any given @xmath4 , there is always a solution of @xmath38 from eq .",
    "( [ cp1 ] ) and there is no condensation .",
    "3 .   finally consider the case when @xmath16 decays ( a ) slower than exponential but ( b ) faster than @xmath45 . in this case , the allowed range of @xmath38 is @xmath46 $ ] over which @xmath40 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath38 .",
    "however , the crucial difference here from the two previous cases is that @xmath50 is finite .",
    "indeed , @xmath50 sets the critical density @xmath51 . when the given @xmath52 , a positive @xmath38 satisfying ( [ cp1 ] ) exists .",
    "however , when @xmath53 , there is no real solution to ( [ cp1 ] ) , signalling a condensation transition . in this phase , the extra mass @xmath6 forms a condensate .    a natural choice of @xmath16 satisfying the criterion of condensation in 3 .",
    "above is @xmath54 for the majority of this paper , we stay with the choice of @xmath16 s in ( [ fm1 ] ) and set , without loss of generality , @xmath55 . for brevity",
    ", we also assume that @xmath56 is non - integer although our analysis can be easily extended to the integer case . in section  [ sec : oc ]",
    "some other forms for @xmath16 will be explored .    the single - site probability distribution @xmath2 is given by @xmath57 which exhibits a characteristic mass @xmath58 . as the critical density is approached @xmath59 decreases to zero and the characteristic mass diverges giving rise to a power law @xmath60 at the critical density . for @xmath61",
    "the grand canonical approach can not be used to determine @xmath62 .",
    "this last point is in contrast to usual bose - einstein condensation where one can work in the gce even in the condensed phase .",
    "this is done by letting the @xmath59 tend to zero as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the volume of the system i.e. any density of bosons can be achieved by carefully letting @xmath65 in a way dependent on system size .",
    "however , in the present case letting @xmath66 in ( [ cp1 ] ) always results in a fixed critical density @xmath67 .",
    "before proceeding with a detailed analysis of the canonical partition function ( [ z ] ) it is instructive to discuss the problem from the perspective of sums of random variables .    first note that if @xmath16 is normalised then @xmath68 is the probability that @xmath1 independent and identically distributed ( iid ) positive random variables , each drawn from a distribution @xmath16 , take the values @xmath69 which we denote by @xmath70 . moreover , the partition function @xmath12 in ( [ z ] ) is precisely the probability that the sum of the random variables is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "equivalently one can think of an ensemble the configurations of which are defined as masses @xmath71 whose sum is @xmath13 , with the weights of the configurations being @xmath68 .",
    "the question of condensation then reduces to the study of the statistical properties of the largest of the @xmath1 random variables .",
    "let us define the moments of @xmath16 as @xmath72 if the mean @xmath73 exists ( e.g. , ( [ fm1 ] ) ) and is such that @xmath74 , we expect the ensemble to be dominated by configurations where @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "however , if @xmath77 then we expect the ensemble to be dominated by configurations where @xmath78 random variables are @xmath79 and one is @xmath80 .",
    "thus , for @xmath81 and @xmath20 we expect condensation at a critical density @xmath82 .",
    "this recovers the results given in section  [ sec : gce ] .",
    "we can also obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the partition function ( [ z ] ) by noting that the large random variable could be any of the @xmath1 possible ones and that its probability @xmath83 .",
    "therefore we expect in the condensed phase @xmath84 it turns out that this simple argument gives the correct asymptotic behavior to be derived in section  [ sec : cangen ] ( see eqs .",
    "( [ pfcon2 ] ) , ( [ pfntail ] ) ) .",
    "let us now consider the fluctuations of the condensate in the case @xmath85 . since we have the constraint of total mass @xmath13 we can equally well consider the fluctuations of the total fluid mass which is essentially the sum of @xmath78 random variables drawn from @xmath16 : @xmath86 now if @xmath87 , then @xmath88 is finite and @xmath89 is the well defined width of @xmath90 .",
    "the standard results of the central limit theorem applies to this fluid component , with @xmath91 ^{1/2 } \\\\ & \\simeq & \\left [ ( \\mu _ 2-\\mu _ 1 ^ 2)l\\right ] ^{1/2}\\quad \\mbox{for}\\quad \\gamma > 3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by constraint , the fluctuation of the condensate will be controlled by @xmath92 .",
    "however if @xmath93 , then @xmath94 does not exist .",
    "instead , @xmath95 will be dominated by the largest of the @xmath78 random variables in the fluid .",
    "therefore @xmath96 in this case the fluctuations of the condensate are large @xmath97 and we refer to this as an anomalous condensate .    in fact , using the sums of random variables interpretation we obtain very quickly the scaling behaviour of our main results . in the following sections we will obtain more precise and detailed results .",
    "the gce analysis of section  [ sec : gce ] correctly predicts the criterion for condensation and even the critical density @xmath98 ( whenever condensation occurs ) , but provides little insight into the condensed phase itself where @xmath53 . in this section",
    "we explore the condensed phase in detail by staying within the framework of a ` canonical ensemble ' and analyzing the single site mass distribution @xmath99 in a finite system of size @xmath1 and total mass @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath2 depends on @xmath1 , though we have suppressed its @xmath1 dependence just for notational simplicity .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ prob ] ) and ( [ z ] ) , we have @xmath101 the rest of this section is devoted to the analysis of @xmath2 in ( [ pm1 ] ) with @xmath16 given by ( [ fm1 ] ) .",
    "we have thus two parameters @xmath56 and @xmath4 .",
    "our goal is to show how the condensation manifests itself in different behaviors of @xmath2 in different regions of the @xmath102 plane .",
    "we will show that for @xmath20 , there is a critical curve @xmath103 in the @xmath102 plane that separates a fluid phase ( for @xmath104 ) from a condensed phase ( for @xmath105 ) . in the fluid phase the mass distribution decays exponentially for large @xmath3 , @xmath106 $ ] where the characteristic mass @xmath107 increases with increasing density and diverges as the density approaches its critical value @xmath5 from below . at @xmath108",
    "the distribution decays as a power law , @xmath109 for large @xmath3 . for @xmath53 , the distribution , in addition to the power law decaying part , develops an additional bump , representing the condensate , centred around the `` excess '' mass : @xmath110 furthermore , by our analysis within the canonical ensemble , we show that even inside the condensed phase ( @xmath111 ) , there are two types of behaviors of the condensate depending on the value of @xmath56 . for @xmath112 , the condensate is characterized by anomalous non - gaussian fluctuations whereas for @xmath87 , the condensate has gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this leads to a rich phase diagram in the @xmath102 plane , a schematic picture of which is presented in fig .",

    "it turns out that in certain cases , to be discussed in section [ sec : exact ] , one can invert ( [ lt1 ] ) exactly .",

    "therefore when @xmath13 is on the scale ( [ pcscale ] ) the constraint of fixed total mass leads to non - trivial @xmath2 .",
    "in this work we have presented an analysis of the partition function ( [ z ] ) of a factorised steady state within the canonical ensemble .",
    "the analysis has revealed the structure of the condensate as summarised in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the two types of condensate occurring when @xmath378 with @xmath379 or @xmath87 correspond to condensates with anomalous ( non - gaussian ) and gaussian fluctuations respectively and each has a distinct scaling function for the shape of the condensate . in both cases",
    "the nonequilibrium phase transition to the condensed phase is continuous in the sense that the characteristic mass of the exponential site mass distribution of the fluid phase diverges as the transition is approached from below .",
    "we have also analysed the case of stretched exponential @xmath16 where condensation occurs but the transition is somewhat different : even though there is a diverging scale one gets a stretched exponential rather than power law distribution @xmath2 at the critical point and in the fluid component of the condensed phase .",
    "finally we have shown that in the case where @xmath378 where @xmath380 a pseudocondensate appears at superextensive critical density , but there is no phase transition .",
    "our results may easily be generalised to the case of discrete mass , exemplified by the zrp where the occupation of each site is @xmath381 and the total mass @xmath13 is a positive integer . in this case",
    "the relevant expression for the canonical partition function is @xmath382^l\\ ; , \\label{zint}\\ ] ] where the integral is around a closed contour about the origin in the complex @xmath383 plane and @xmath384 the phase transition occurs when the saddle point of the @xmath383 integral reaches the radius of convergence of ( [ fdef ] ) . for @xmath16 of the form ( [ fm1 ] ) the radius of convergence is @xmath385 , therefore we let @xmath386 and expand @xmath387 for @xmath388 small as @xmath389 where @xmath390 is the integer part of @xmath238 and @xmath391 the second term in ( [ fb1u ] ) is the leading singular part and the coefficient @xmath166 is again @xmath392 .",
    "the general analysis and results then follow analogously to that of section  [ sec : cangen ] .",
    "the structure of the condensate also has implications for the dynamics within the steady state . in the steady state",
    "a site must be randomly selected to hold the condensate thus the translational symmetry is broken .",
    "however on any finite lattice there will be a timescale @xmath393 over which the condensate dissolves and reforms on another spontaneously selected site . in systems with symmetry breaking , the ` flip time '",
    "@xmath393 @xcite is of interest .",
    "a recent study @xcite has shown that for the zrp with asymmetric mass transfer and dynamics which yield @xmath378 the flip time grows as @xmath394 .",
    "this result was found numerically and also from a simple effective desciption for the condensate dynamics .",
    "that effective description requires a structure for @xmath2 , in particular a dip to the left of the condensate bump , which is borne out by the exact results presented here .",
    "finally we mention that it would be interesting to analyse condensation in steady states that are not factorised , such as in the chipping model of  @xcite . generally , such steady states exhibit stronger correlations than a factorised one . in such cases a factorised steady state",
    "is often used as a ` mean - field ' approximation in the sense that some of the correlations in the true steady state are ignored .",
    "condensation is known to occur in some cases of non - factorised steady states  @xcite , on the other hand there are some examples where the mean field approximation predicts a condensation transition but in the true steady state there is none  @xcite .",
    "it is of importance to further investigate these issues .",
