    "there are a number of problems to face and study within the present approach .",
    "let us make an incomplete list :    0.3 truecm    \\(i ) there is the possibility that more than one heavy right - handed neutrino decays out of equilibrium , contributing to the leptogenesis , a point that , in particular , has been suggested rather clearly in ref .",
    "if we guess a temperature @xmath213 below which all heavy neutrinos decay out - of - equilibrium , then not only the lightest @xmath71 decays out - of equilibrium after the level crossing , but also @xmath115 is in the same situation . on the other hand , the heavy neutrino spectrum being rather compact , the natural thing to do would be to consider the contributions to @xmath173 of all three heavy neutrinos @xmath71 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , i.e. to compute @xmath67 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 and the relevant washout factors .    for the moment we just expect that the consideration of the three neutrinos will not spoil the good features of the calculations of the present paper , that take only into account the lightest neutrino @xmath71before the crossing .",
    "we have given an argument going in this sense in section 10 where we have seen that , before the level crossing , the contribution of the next - to - lightest neutrino @xmath115 is negligible compared to the one of the lightest one @xmath71 .",
    "0.2 truecm    \\(ii ) one should take into account also the level crossing region and therefore the finite width of the right - handed neutrinos , as well as the delicate question of their interference .",
    "these problems have been treated in great detail by a. pilaftsis and collaborators @xcite that , to be complete , need to be adopted within our approach",
    ".    0.2 truecm    \\(iii ) the flavor effects , thoroughly studied by a. abada et al .",
    "@xcite are also a delicate question to study in this region of compact right - handed neutrino spectrum , and this should also be performed .    0.2 truecm",
    "\\(iv ) it would be worth to study the more general case for cp violation outlined in section 9 , and make a detailed scan of the results in the case of general complex inhomogeneous terms - or equivalently general light neutrino majorana phases - , with the constraint of having a compact heavy neutrino spectrum .",
    "0.2 truecm    \\(v ) it could be that the homogeneous equations ( [ 5.1e ] ) correspond to some symmetry , the inhomogeneous terms ( that we have introduced to get a large enough cp violation @xmath67 ) being a breaking of this symmetry , a possibility that would be interesting .",
    "our demand of a compact @xmath10 spectrum , and of an approximate quark - lepton symmetry implying a hierarchical spectrum for the dirac neutrino masses with a similar structure between @xmath59 and the ckm mixing matrix , brings to a scenario where the lepton asymmetry comes out naturally , producing the required order of magnitude for the baryon asymmetry @xmath214 .",
    "we have assumed and justified that @xmath173 is dominated by the contribution of the lightest neutrino @xmath71 .",
    "there are three cp - violating phases in the whole approach , the phase @xmath2 of the @xmath59 unitary matrix , and the light neutrino majorana phases @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we take @xmath2 to be of the order of the kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath77 .",
    "we have thoroughly studied in a quantitative way a particular case in which all cp violating effects are computed in terms of @xmath2 , in particular @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting that one can get a baryon asymmetry of the right order of magnitude taking @xmath215 . of course ,",
    "this result is not obtained in the standard model , but in a new physics scheme under particular assumptions : baryogenesis via leptogenesis , @xmath0 grand unification , approximate quark - lepton symmetry and compact heavy @xmath10 spectrum . in the limit @xmath185 ,",
    "one gets indeed @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "let us emphasize that @xmath2 induces also small cp violating corrections to the light neutrino majorana phases , that turn out to be naturally close to @xmath220 . the effective neutrino mass , relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay , comes out to be rather small , of the order of @xmath218 , because of strong cancellations due to the majorana phases .      in the region of quasi - degeneracy",
    ", the heaviest @xmath10 has a mass of the order @xmath221 , roughly consistent with the expected scale of @xmath27 symmetry breaking , so that @xmath0 breaks down to the pati - salam group @xmath6 at the expected natural intermediate scale .",
