    "it was in the 1980s , when the idea of exploiting quantum degrees of freedom for information processing was envisioned .",
    "the central question at the time was whether and how it was possible to simulate ( efficiently ) any finite physical system with a man - made machine .",
    "deutsch @xcite argued that such a simulation is not possible perfectly within the classical computational framework that had been developed for decades .",
    "he suggested , together with other researchers such as feynman @xcite , that the universal computing machine should be of quantum nature , _",
    "i.e. _ , a quantum computer .    around the same time",
    ", developments in two different areas of research and industry took a tremendous influence on the advent of quantum computing . on the one hand , it was experimentally confirmed @xcite that nature indeed does possess some peculiar non - local aspects which were heavily debated since the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "schrdinger @xcite coined the term ` entanglement ' , comprising the apparent possibility for faraway parties to observe highly correlated measurement results as a consequence of the global and instantaneous collapse of the wave function according to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the existence of entanglement is crucial for many quantum computations . on the other hand",
    ", the booming computer industry led to major progress in semiconductor and laser technology , a prerequisite for the possibility to fabricate , address and manipulate single quantum systems , as needed in a quantum computer .",
    "as the emerging fields of quantum information and nanotechnology inspired and motivated each other in various ways , and are still doing so today more than ever , many interesting results have been obtained so far , some of them we are about to review in this work .",
    "while the theories of quantum complexity and entanglement are being established ( a process which is far from being complete ) and fast quantum algorithms for classically difficult problems have been discovered , the control and manipulation of single quantum systems is now experimental reality .",
    "there are various systems that may be employed as qubits in a quantum computer , _",
    "i.e. _ , the basic unit of quantum information . here , we will focus on the idea of using the spins of electrons confined in quantum dots , a proposal made in 1997 @xcite .",
    "most knowledge for realizing qubits in the fashion of the spin - qubit proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite has so far been obtained for quantum dots formed in a two - dimensional electron gas at the interface of a gaas / algaas heterostructure .",
    "therefore , this is the main type of quantum dot we will turn our attention to .",
    "we would nevertheless like to mention that many other systems are investigated intensively at present , such as carbon nanotubes @xcite , nanowires @xcite , molecular magnets @xcite , quantum dots in graphene @xcite , and nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond @xcite .",
    "the idea behind this work is to review quantum computing starting at its very roots , and ending at the current state of knowledge of one of its many branches , here being the spin - qubit proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite for electron spins in gaas quantum dots .",
    "we approach the subject in the second section by beginning with classical computing and complexity theory , mainly to see the concepts that inspired the so - called standard model of quantum computing discussed later , and to encounter examples of problems that are assumed to be too involved to ever be solved in reasonable time on a classical computer .",
    "we then review a set of requirements that every quantum computing proposal should fulfill in order to be usable on a large scale @xcite . after discussing the actual spin - qubit proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , we end the chapter with some recent alternative models of quantum computing and a section about entanglement measures and their numerical evaluation .    while the second section is quite general , we focus in the third section on spin manipulation in gaas quantum dots .",
    "we discuss the latest experimental achievements and we will see that it recently became possible to define , initialize , manipulate , and read out single electron spin qubits with an already quite remarkable rate of success .",
    "although anticipated to some extent in the third section , the last section intensively discusses the various mechanisms of decoherence and possible ways to reduce its effects , which is a necessary prerequisite for large - scale quantum computing . in greater detail , we investigate the role of the spin - orbit and the hyperfine interaction .",
    "we show how these mechanisms cause relaxation of the electron spin , but also how they can be exploited to perform such beneficial tasks as all - electrical single spin manipulation or full polarization of the quantum dot s nuclear bath .",
    "computers are devices that solve problems in an algorithmic fashion .",
    "the church - turing hypothesis @xcite claims that every function which we would naturally regard as being computable by an algorithm ( _ i.e. _ , a procedure that solves a given problem in finite time ) can be computed by the universal turing machine ( _ i.e. _ , a hypothetical , mathematically formalized , programmable discrete machine ) .",
    "fortunately , the rather cumbersome notion of a turing machine turns out to be computationally equivalent to a more human - friendly description of algorithms , namely the circuit representation .",
    "the basic unit of information , the bit , is a physical system that can be in exactly one out of two states , usually denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "information ( or data ) is stored in binary form using many bits which are represented as lines in the circuit .",
    "the data is processed by consecutively applying logical gates to the bits , depicted symbolically as elements acting between the lines in the circuit , such that the desired algorithm is     a ) classical xor gate .",
    "b ) its quantum analog , _",
    "i.e. _ , the cnot gate . the truth table of the xor gate is shown in the lower part of a ) and simply comes from adding the two input bits modulo 2 ( this is the @xmath2 operation ) . by replacing @xmath0 with @xmath3 and @xmath1 with @xmath4 one obtains the truth table for the target qubit ( lower wire ) in cnot if the computational basis states are used as input . however , the cnot gate is also the source of entanglement ( see also subsect .  [",
    "sec : entanglement measures ] ) in the standard model of quantum computing , as indicated in the lower part of b ) by the fact that , generally , two states can not be written as a product state @xmath5 anymore after cnot has been applied.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    performed and the solution to the problem is stored in the bits .",
    "examples of such gates include the 1-bit not gate which flips the state of a bit from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and vice versa , and the 2-bit xor gate that outputs @xmath1 if and only if exactly one of the input bits is @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gates ] ) .",
    "an important result here is the fact that there exists a set of gates with which one can implement any algorithm in a circuit , provided one can freely distribute and copy information",
    ". for classical information , the latter constraint is trivial and the so - called universal set of gates consists in fact of only the nand gate ( yielding @xmath0 if and only if both input bits are 1 ) .    having set the playground to implement algorithms tackling computational problems , one of the most profound questions one can ask is the following : what is the _ most efficient _ algorithm to solve a particular task ?",
    "it is the field of computational complexity theory @xcite that deals with such kind of issues .",
    "we will briefly discuss the most important complexity classes , focussing on time rather than space complexity .",
    "imagining that every gate in a circuit requires a finite execution time , one can study the total time required to run an algorithm as a function of the input or problem size , _",
    "e.g. _ , the number of input bits @xmath6 .",
    "a procedure is called efficient ( or tractable ) if its running time is upper - bounded by some polynomial in @xmath6 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the complexity class consists of all problems known to have efficient algorithms .",
    "sorting or searching lists are examples thereof .",
    "however , there is also a vast amount of problems solved by algorithms that are not efficient ( typically exponential in @xmath6 ) , but once a possible solution has been proposed , it can be efficiently checked for its validity .",
    "the class of these types of problems is called .",
    "an important example thereof is integer factorization : given an @xmath6-bit integer , the best known classical algorithm to find its prime factors is exponential in @xmath6 , but given a proposed factorization one can quickly check whether it is correct by doing the required multiplications .",
    "the observation that there are problems that can be solved efficiently , and others , for which the best known solution is still worse than polynomial , cumulates in the famous question : it is clear that is a subset of , but is this inclusion strict ?",
    "in other words , have we just not yet discovered efficient algorithms for supposedly ` hard ' problems , or is there something fundamental within these problems that prevents us from finding such ?",
    "this puzzling question has not been answered yet with a formal proof , but it is widely assumed that and are not equal .    another important complexity class is -complete , a subset of consisting of all problems that are at least as hard as all other problems in .",
    "this means that every problem in can be cast into an instance of a problem in -complete in polynomial time . with this transformation being efficient ,",
    "a polynomial - time solution to any one of the problems in -complete would render the whole class tractable and it would follow that .",
    "integer factorization is widely suspected , but not proven , to be both outside of _ and _ -complete .",
    "finally , we remark that there is a complexity class of high practical interest , which we include here merely because it has a quantum analog that we will encounter in subsect .",
    "[ sec : quant algo and quant complexity ] .",
    "decision problems in the class ( for bounded - error probabilistic time ) have efficient algorithms that are allowed to make random choices ( ` coin flipping ' ) during the computation and yield the correct answer with probability @xmath7 , and a wrong solution with probability @xmath8 .",
    "the choice of @xmath9 is essentially arbitrary , since the chernoff bound @xcite guarantees that the error probability in a majority vote drops exponentially with the number of repetitive executions of the algorithm .",
    "typically , however , one finds @xmath10 or @xmath11 in the literature .      in a seminal work by deutsch @xcite",
    ", he proposes to strengthen the church - turing hypothesis into a `` manifestly physical and unambiguous '' form .",
    "his church - turing principle reads : `` every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means '' , arguing that `` it would surely be hard to regard a function ` naturally ' as computable if it could not be computed in nature , and conversely '' .",
    "it is further shown that the universal turing machine does not fulfill this principle , while the ` universal quantum computer ' , proposed in the same work , is compatible with the principle .",
    "a maybe less theoretic reasoning for studying computing machines operating in the quantum regime is the mere fact that classical computers are governed by newtonian mechanics , being valid only in a limiting case of the underlying quantum theory @xcite .",
    "quantum computers must therefore have at least the same , if not a greater , computational power than classical computers .",
    "historically understandable , the now so - called standard model of quantum computing @xcite follows closely the circuit model discussed earlier ( for alternative proposals of quantum computing , see subsect .  [",
    "sec : alternative qc ] ) .",
    "the basic unit of information is the _ qubit _ , being a two - level quantum system with basis states usually denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 according to its classical counterpart .",
    "qubits are displayed as lines in the circuit to which quantum gates are applied successively , thereby performing the computation .",
    "the final result is obtained as a readout ( a measurement ) of the qubits in the computer s final state .",
    "the following features distinguish quantum from classical computing .",
    "firstly , quantum states can not be copied perfectly ( this is the no - cloning theorem @xcite ) . secondly , the nature of a quantum computer is ultimately an analog one .",
    "quantum gates operate on amplitudes such as @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the state @xmath14 . apart from being properly normalized , amplitudes are arbitrary complex numbers and as such analog .",
    "thirdly , qubits can be in superpositions and may form intricate entangled states .",
    "this fact is heavily exploited in existing quantum algorithms and is essentially the key ingredient to the majority of them .",
    "these first three points all contribute to the drawback that error correction , a necessity in the presence of imperfect gates and decoherence , is a non - trivial thing to do .",
    "quantum error correction , however , turns out to be possible if the error probability per gate is smaller than some finite value for all gates ( see criterion 3 in subsect .  [",
    "sec : divcriteria ] ) . and lastly , quantum gates must be time - reversal , _",
    "i.e. _ , unitary operators , in accordance with basic principles of quantum mechanics . apart from the latter , there are no other constraints imposed on quantum gates .",
    "analogous to the classical case , and quite remarkably , there exist finite sets of gates which can be used to approximate any unitary evolution ( _ i.e. _ , the computation ) of the quantum machine to arbitrary precision @xcite .",
    "an example thereof is the universal set @xcite consisting of the two single - qubit gates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the two - qubit cnot gate which performs the operation @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the gates are represented as usual in the standard computational basis , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the @xmath21- and @xmath22- gates",
    "are used to approximate arbitrary single - qubit rotations @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a real unit vector and @xmath25 is the vector of pauli matrices . if arbitrary rotations are available on their own , one can together with the cnot gate implement any unitary evolution _",
    "exactly_.      having the new quantum machine at hand , what is its computational power , and how does it perform compared with classical computers ?",
    "such questions have given birth to the new field of quantum complexity theory @xcite , resulting in a plethora of new quantum complexity classes along with the goal of understanding their relations both between each other , and to classical complexity classes .",
    "this is an active field of research and the goal mentioned before is far from being reached . instead of going into the details of the theory , which would be out of the scope of this work , we sketch an overview of the subject using the most prominent examples .",
    "one of the first algorithms demonstrating that quantum computers may be able to drastically outperform classical computers is the deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite .",
    "let @xmath26 be a function from @xmath6 bits to one bit that can either be constant or balanced , the latter meaning that there are exactly @xmath27 unknown input strings yielding the output @xmath0 .",
    "the function is supposed to be implemented in an oracle , _",
    "i.e. _ , a black box without any further internal specification . the deutsch - jozsa algorithm can determine the function s type ( _ i.e. _ , constant or balanced ) with probability @xmath1 by querying the oracle just once .",
    "a deterministic classical algorithm requires @xmath28 queries in the worst case , as one may coincidentally pick all the @xmath27 input strings that yield the same output queries and returning the wrong result with arbitrary low probability ( dropping exponentially with @xmath29 ) . ] .",
    "the deutsch - jozsa algorithm obtains its power from bringing a register of @xmath6 qubits into an equally weighted superposition of all possible bit strings using a hadamard transform which is a special case of a so - called quantum fourier transform @xcite . using this state as the input for the oracle ,",
    "the function can be evaluated simultaneously on all strings in the superposition with just one query .",
    "this functionality in quantum computing is referred to as quantum parallelism . without going into further details ,",
    "the deutsch - jozsa algorithm manages to output the correct result with certainty using these techniques .",
    "however , one has to be cautious not to get the impression that one can calculate and obtain all function values of an arbitrary function with just one query of an oracle .",
    "in general , one is left with a superposition of results collapsing upon measurement and yielding just one function value .",
    "the deutsch - jozsa algorithm is cleverly designed to work with certainty for a particular type of problem .",
    "these ideas are not straightforwardly adapted to problems involving other kinds of functions .",
    "the constant / balanced problem is an example from the class ( exact quantum polynomial - time ) @xcite , denoting all problems solved in polynomial time by a quantum algorithm with success probability equal to @xmath1 .",
    "is the analog to the classical complexity class .    on the other hand ,",
    "the set of problems having tractable algorithms on a quantum computer with error probability smaller than @xmath30 is denoted by ( bounded - error quantum polynomial - time ) @xcite , its classical counterpart being .",
    "it contains more interesting problems whose solutions are of greater relevance than the deutsch - jozsa algorithm .",
    "famous examples thereof are grover s @xcite and shor s @xcite algorithms .",
    "grover s algorithm searches an unsorted database in time upper - bound by a function proportional to @xmath31 and has a probability of failure scaling as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of database entries .",
    "although the speed - up with respect to the classical database search which runs in time proportional to @xmath33 is not exponential , it is still of great benefit especially for large @xmath33 .",
    "grover s algorithm could be used to speed up brute - force search attempts for finding solutions to computationally hard problems . however , probably the most prominent problem in is integer factorization .",
    "shor @xcite has shown that a quantum computer can factor an integer in polynomial time , a task which is supposed to be exponentially hard on a classical computer .",
    "these kind of discoveries have resulted in a tremendous increase of interest in quantum computing .",
    "for example , shor s algorithm can be used to break present - day public - key cryptosystems who rely on the hardness of factorizing integers being a product of two large prime numbers ( such as rsa @xcite ) .    a quantum complexity class that has recently called attention is @xcite ( quantum merlin - arthur ) , which can be seen as a quantum analog of .",

    "a ` yes ' instance can be verified by providing an eigenstate with energy smaller than @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , one can show that polynomial verifiers can be constructed that accept ( reject ) ` yes ' instances ( ` no ' instances ) with sufficient probability .",
    "it is now known that @xmath29-local hamiltonian is -complete for @xmath50 @xcite , meaning the following : given an instance @xmath38 of any problem @xmath51 in , one can find ( in time poly(@xmath6 ) ) an instance of @xmath29-local hamiltonian ( by constructing a @xmath29-local @xmath21 and specifying properly chosen parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , such that , if @xmath38 is a ` yes ' instance of @xmath51 , the ground state energy of @xmath21 is smaller than @xmath47 , and if @xmath38 is a ` no ' instance , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath21 is larger than @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath29-local hamiltonian ( for @xmath52 ) is as hard as any other problem in .",
    "this ` hardness ' suggests that calculating the ground state energy , and possibly other ground state properties , is intractable even on a quantum computer .",
    "the study of @xmath29-local hamiltonian is also important in the context of adiabatic quantum computing , see subsubsect .",
    "[ sec : adiabatic qc ] .      in this section ,",
    "we review the five divincenzo criteria @xcite for the physical implementation of quantum computing .",
    "these are the most fundamental requirements any proposal for a quantum computer must fulfill in order to work with an arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "starting from sect .",
    "[ sec : spin manipulation in gaas ] , we will examine the experimental and theoretical progress toward realizing these criteria for the spin - qubit proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see the next section ) .",
    "_ 1 . a scalable physical system with well characterized qubits . _",
    "we have already defined the notion of a qubit as simply being a two - level quantum system . in this review",
    ", we will focus solely on the electron spin in quantum dots .",
    "the word ` scalable ' plays an important role : even if current fundamental experiments are performed with only few qubits , they must at least in principle be preparable or manufacturable in large numbers , since only in this case interesting and useful quantum computations can be performed .",
    "a qubit must also be ` well characterized ' in the sense that one has a good theoretical description not only of the qubit itself ( in terms of an internal hamiltonian , accurate knowledge of all physical parameters , etc . ) , but also of all relevant mechanisms that couple qubits among each other and to the environment .",
    "on the one hand , this is necessary to explore the possibilities of manipulating qubits and letting them interact , but also , on the other hand , in order to understand and fight the various forms of decoherence a qubit may suffer from ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : relax ] ) .",
    "_ 2 . the ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple fiducial state . _",
    "it is clear that every computation needs to be started in an initially known state such as @xmath53 .",
    "but this is not the end of the story .",
    "having a fast initialization mechanism at hand is crucial for quantum error correction ( see next criterion ) , typically requiring large amounts of ancillary qubits in known initial states in order to perform its job properly . if a fast zeroing of qubits is not possible , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the initialization time is long compared to gate operation times , then ref .",
    "@xcite proposes to equip the quantum computer with `` some kind of ` qubit conveyor belt ' , on which qubits in need of initialization are carried away from the region in which active computation is taking place , initialized while on the ` belt ' , then brought back to the active place after the initialization is finished . ''    in spin qubits , initialization could be achieved by either forcing the spins to align with a strong externally applied magnetic field , or by performing a measurement on the dot followed by a subsequent rotation of the state depending on the measurement outcome .",

    "may be corrected , depending on what kind of code is used .",
    "there is however still a limit on how faulty elementary gates are allowed to be : the accuracy threshold theorem @xcite states that error correction is possible if the error probability per gate is smaller than a certain threshold .",
    "this threshold comes about the fact that encoding , verification , and correction steps require an additional overhead of quantum gates , which introduces new possible sources of errors .",

    "i.e. _ , encoding logical qubits recursively , where using different codes per concatenation level is allowed , the effective error on the top level of concatenation can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "the threshold value depends on the error models studied and on the details of the codes considered .",

    "it is also important to note the fact that faulty gates may introduce systematic or random errors in a calculation .",
