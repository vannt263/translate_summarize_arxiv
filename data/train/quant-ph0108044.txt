    "<S> it is shown that radiation pressure can be profitably used to entangle _ macroscopic _ oscillators like movable mirrors , using present technology . </S>",
    "<S> we prove a new sufficient criterion for entanglement and show that the achievable entanglement is robust against thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> its signature can be revealed using common optomechanical readout apparatus </S>",
    "<S> .    2    the fundamental role of _ entanglement _ @xcite in quantum mechanics has been re - emphasized in recent years @xcite . in this context , an important point is to asses whether this peculiarity of the quantum world , i.e. , the entanglement , could be applicable to macroscopic bodies and , moreover , measurable .    </S>",
    "<S> literature focused on methods to prepare atoms in entangled states already exists @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experiment generating entanglement of two gas samples @xcite is a striking achievement . </S>",
    "<S> then , a real challenge is to devise the possibility of applying similar arguments to macroscopic , massive oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> here we propose an experiment , which could be realized with present technologies , to show that it is possible to entangle massive oscillators exploiting the radiation pressure force .    </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed usually believed that , being a superposition of states , the entanglement between massive , macroscopic , objects is practically impossible to detect because of the fast diagonalization of the system s density matrix due to the coupling with the environment @xcite . on the contrary , by using a new sufficient criterion for entanglement , we shall derive the parameter region for which two massive , movable , cavity mirrors can be entangled by the radiation pressure exerted by a cavity mode , and we shall show how to measure the degree of entanglement . beside foundation interest , the ability to place such oscillators in entangled states may even result useful in applications , as in high precision measurements @xcite .    to be concrete , as a specific model we consider two end mirrors of an optical cavity , which can both oscillate under the effect of radiation pressure force . </S>",
    "<S> cavities with one movable mirror have already been studied @xcite , and a wide class of quantum states resulting from optomechanical coupling was proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , due to recent technological developments in optomechanics , this area is now becoming experimentally accessible @xcite .    as pointed out in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , under the assumption that the measurement time is either less or of the order of the mechanical relaxation time , it is possible to consider a macroscopic oscillator , i.e. , a movable mirror in our case , as a quantum oscillator . then , for not too high oscillation frequency , with respect to the inverse round trip times of photons within the cavities , we can write the hamiltonian of the system sketched in figure [ fig1 ] as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the destruction and creation operators of the electromagnetic fields corresponding to the meters mode and @xmath3 their frequency ( assumed equal for simplicity ) . </S>",
    "<S> instead , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are those of the _ entangler _ mode ( the use of this terminology will become clear in the following ) and @xmath6 its frequency </S>",
    "<S> . finally , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the dimensionless position and momentum operators of the mirrors @xmath9 , both oscillating at frequency @xmath10 , and having mass @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the first row of equation ( [ h ] ) simply represents the free hamiltonian , whereas the second represents the effect of the radiation pressure force which causes the instantaneous displacement of the mirrors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constants are @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 are related to the cavity mode frequencies , to the equilibrium length of the cavities , and to the reflection angles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last two rows represent the driving fields action in the usual rotating wave approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that both meters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are driven at frequency @xmath18 , while the entangler mode @xmath4 is driven at frequency @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the classical fields characterizing the input laser powers @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the cavity linewidths .    by considering , the unitary evolution of the two mirrors and the entangler , neglecting the meters modes and the driving terms in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) , it can be easily checked that the formers become entangled once a von neumann projection onto the @xmath4-mode quadrature is performed ( this is why we named such mode entangler ) . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of the problem , however , must include photon losses , the thermal noise on the mirrors , and the measurement backaction . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the interaction of all optical modes with their respective reservoirs and the effect of thermal fluctuations on the two mirrors , not considered in hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , must be added to this equation . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished in the standard way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting hamiltonian gives rise to nonlinear langevin equations whose linearization around the steady state leads to @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and all the operators now represent small fluctuations around steady state values . </S>",
    "<S> these are @xmath28/\\omega , \\\\ \\\\    </S>",

    "<S> \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are the radiation phase shifts due to the detuning and to the stationary displacement of the mirrors . both radiation fields used as meters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are damped through output fixed mirrors at the same rate @xmath31 , while the entangler mode @xmath4 is damped at rate @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath32 is the mechanical damping rate for the mirrors brownian motion . without loss of generality , we choose @xmath33 real and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the vacuum ( white ) noise operators at the cavity inputs . </S>",
    "<S> the noise operator for the quantum brownian motion of the mirrors is @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the non - vanishing noise correlations are @xmath38 }   { e^{i\\omega(t - t ' ) } } \\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath40 the equilibrium temperature ( </S>",
    "<S> the two mirrors are considered in equilibrium with their respective bath at the same temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the used approach for the brownian motion is quantum mechanical consistent at every temperature @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the unitary evolution under the linearized hamiltonian leading to system of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lineqs ] ) gives entanglement , as in the non - linearized case discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the main task is to see whether such quantum correlations are visible or blurred by noisy effects . to accomplish this task </S>",
    "<S> , we first solve the system ( [ lineqs ] ) in the frequency domain by introducing the pseudo fourier transform @xmath41 for each operator @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the measurement time assumed to be large compared to all the relevant timescales of the system dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now consider the measured current at each meter output . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary relations for the meters radiation fields @xcite , i.e. , @xmath44 , yield the phase quadratures @xmath45 at the output , namely @xmath46 thus , the measurement of the output quadrature @xmath47 , in the detection box @xmath48 , indirectly gives the mirror position @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in homodyne detections , the positive and negative frequency components of the quadrature being measured are combined through a proper modulation , in order to achieve the measurement of a hermitian operator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , it would be possible to indirectly measure either @xmath50 $ ] or @xmath51 $ ] , which implies the possibility to measure position or momentum for each macroscopic oscillator .    </S>",
    "<S> these measurements can be used to establish when the two oscillating cavity mirrors are entangled . </S>",
    "<S> sufficient criteria for entanglement of continuous variable systems already exist @xcite , but here we shall introduce a _ </S>",
    "<S> new _ sufficient inseparability criterion , involving the _ product _ of variances of continuous observables :    _ theorem_. if we define @xmath52 and @xmath53 , then , for any separable quantum state @xmath54 , one has @xmath55\\rangle|^2 \\,.\\ ] ] see the appendix for the proof .    </S>",
    "<S> this theorem allows us to establish a connection with refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which showed that when the inequality @xmath56\\rangle|^2\\,,\\ ] ] is satisfied , an epr - like paradox arises@xcite , based on the inconsistency between quantum mechanics and local realism . notice that the sufficient condition for inseparability of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e3 ] ) is weaker than condition ( [ infer ] ) , but this is not surprising , since entangled states are only a necessary condition for the realization of an epr - like paradox .    </S>",
    "<S> the theorem ( [ e3 ] ) can then be used to establish the conditions under which the two massive oscillators are entangled . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , defining the hermitian operator @xmath57/2 $ ] for any operator @xmath58 in the frequency domain , and using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e3 ] ) , we define the degree of entanglement @xmath59 as @xmath60 \\rangle\\right|^2}\\,,\\ ] ] ( we use the fact that @xmath61 in our case ) which is a marker of entanglement whenever @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> if , moreover , it goes below @xmath63 , that indicates the presence of epr correlations .    to calculate the function @xmath59 we evaluate the correlations @xmath64 and use the solutions of ( [ lineqs ] ) and correlations ( [ noise ] ) in the frequency domain </S>",
    "<S> . in doing that , we require @xmath65 and @xmath66 because a strong interaction between mirrors and entangler is desirable . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the system - meter interaction , instead , has to guarantee only a sufficient measurement gain . </S>",
    "<S> this condition , by referring to eq.([yout ] ) , corresponds to @xmath67 .    in fig.[fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show the behavior of the degree of entanglement ( [ edef ] ) as function of frequency and temperature for massive oscillators with @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum entanglement is always obtained at the frequency @xmath10 of the oscillating mirrors where the mechanical response is maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the useful bandwidth becomes narrower and tends to disappear as the temperature increases . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , a large amount of entanglement is available at reasonable temperatures e.g. @xmath72 @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> it means to have purely quantum effects at macroscopic scale notwithstanding @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the values of parameters here employed are essentially those already used in experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , considering single mode oscillators , as we have done here , is not a restrictive assumption because the various internal and external oscillating modes of the mirrors have different oscillation frequencies and they can be easily distinguished and addressed when measurements are performed in the frequency domain . </S>",
    "<S> other promising candidates for the realization of entanglement between two massive objects are given by mesoscopic resonators , such as microfabricated cantilevers @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> as can be evicted from fig.[fig2 ] , at low temperatures , @xmath75 lies below the limit @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the studied system also provides an example of _ macroscopic _ epr correlations , though with the experimental set - up of ref.@xcite , a further condition , concerning the spatial separation between the two systems , is required to test the paradox @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . however , other possible set - ups could be devised permitting even such test . </S>",
    "<S> demonstration of entanglement is instead much less demanding .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have exploited the ponderomotive force to entangle macroscopic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> reliable conditions to achieve this goal are established by also accounting for a measurement of the degree of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results appears quite robust against the thermal noise and could be challenging tested with current technologies opening new perspectives towards the use of quantum mechanics in macroscopic world . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the possibility to prepare entangled state at the macroscopic level may prove to be useful for high precision and metrology applications . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it is possible to see that a scheme similar to that of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 can be used to improve the detection of weak forces @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ appendix _    </S>",
    "<S> we prove the sufficient criterion for inseparability for the pair of continuous variable operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is an arbitrary ( nonzero ) real number . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath79 and using the same first steps of the proof of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we have @xmath80 where the symbol @xmath81 denotes average over the product density operator @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> by applying the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath83 we can rewrite @xmath84 then using the fact that @xmath85 , we have @xmath86 we then use again the cauchy - schwartz inequality and get @xmath87^{1/4}\\right)^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which gives the final inequality of eq .  </S>",
