    "table 1 of this paper presents self - consistent parameter sets for muon collider storage rings at center - of - mass energies of @xmath1 , 30 and 100 tev .",
    "the parameter sets have benefitted and evolved from previous attempts at defining plausible parameter sets for many - tev muon colliders .",
    "it is helpful to begin by reviewing these previous studies and their motivation in order to provide a context for the discussion of the current parameters .",
    "parameter sets for muon collider rings at energies up to @xmath2 tev were presented in 1998  @xcite and 1999  @xcite . following this",
    ", a much improved level of understanding was then obtained from the first substantial dedicated study of such many - tev muon colliders , which took place at the week - long hemc99 workshop  @xcite . the majority of the studies at hemc99 either assumed or critiqued straw - man parameter sets  @xcite , one at @xmath3 and two at 100 tev , that were provided expressly for this purpose .    besides presenting an overview of the hemc99 parameter sets , reference  @xcite also reviewed the feed - back on the parameters that was provided by the workshop .",
    "this paper should be referred to for many discussions that remain relevant for the current parameter sets of table 1 .",
    "the 48 participants at hemc99 considered side - by - side the accelerator challenges and the high energy physics ( hep ) potential of many - tev muon colliders .",
    "the hep motivation for the workshop was very strong because experimental discoveries in hep normally come from advances in energy reach , as has been emphasized and discussed in , for example , references  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "hep discussions specific to many - tev muon colliders can be found in  @xcite and , mainly , in the hemc99 proceedings  @xcite .    of the three many - tev parameter sets in table 1 , those at 10 tev and 100 tev evolved directly from the corresponding 10 tev and ( the first of the ) 100 tev parameter sets for hemc99 , taking into account the constructive criticisms that emerged from the workshop .",
    "a mid - point energy was considered valuable for examining parameter trends with increasing energy , and the 30 tev parameter set provides such an interpolation between the lower and higher energy sets .",
    "invaluable benchmarks for all of these many - tev studies were provided by lower energy parameters that have been studied and evaluated  @xcite by the muon collider collaboration ( mcc ) .",
    "the first column of table 1 shows , for comparison , the range of parameters for the muon colliders in the range @xmath4 , 3 tev from the mcc s status report  @xcite .",
    "the energy scale and some other parameter choices in table 1 were strongly influenced by considerations of synchrotron radiation .",
    "this imposes a natural cut - off scale for circular muon storage rings in the range @xmath5 tev since the synchrotron radiation loss at such energies has risen rapidly to become comparable to the beam power . at hemc99",
    ", telnov made the additional observation  @xcite that the quantum nature of the sychrotron radiation could lead to beam heating , rather than cooling , for sufficiently high beam energies and small emittances .",
    "this observation effectively invalidated the more aggressive of the two hemc99 parameter sets at 100 tev  which therefore wo nt be discussed further in this paper  and also cast some doubt on the 100 tev parameter set with the larger emittance .",
    "the synchrotron radiation concerns were addressed in the 100 tev parameter set in table 1 by :    1 .   raising the emittance in each of the transverse coordinates by the large factor of 90 .",
    "this should comfortably address telnov s concern and result in net synchrotron cooling by raising the horizontal emittance to well above the quantum break - even value 2 .",
    "increasing the collider ring circumference by a factor of two and , correspondingly , reducing the average bending magnetic field by a factor of two , to 5.3 tesla 3 .   reducing the average beam current by nearly a factor of 2 , to 4 ma .",
    "the combined effect of the second and third changes was to reduce the synchrotron radiation to 50 mw , down from the previous , somewhat problematic level of 195 mw in the hemc99 parameter set . although still a factor of 2.5 larger than the synchrotron power at lep ii , this reduced level was considered very appropriate for a far future collider at the energy frontier .",
    "these changes should also help to address reservations expressed by harrison  @xcite at hemc99 about the feasibility of 10 tesla cosine theta dipoles in the presence of large amounts of synchrotron radiation . besides lowering the average required magnetic field by a factor of two",
    ", it is noted that the synchrotron radiation power deposited per unit length around the collider ring has fallen by almost a factor of 8 from the hemc99 parameter set at 100 tev .",
    "in addition to the adjustments just mentioned that were specific to the 100 tev parameter set , all three many - tev parameter sets in table 1 were made more conservative than the hemc99 parameter sets in several areas :    * in recognition of the difficulty and novelty of ionization cooling , the phase space densities in table 1 were all scaled back to coincide with the upper end of the parameter choices from reference  @xcite for lower energy muon colliders , i.e. @xmath6 @xmath7 . *",
    "the final focus parameters are perhaps the most difficult of all for a non - specialist to evaluate . as has been discussed in references  @xcite , the final focus difficulty can be usefully benchmarked to other muon collider and @xmath8 collider parameter sets according to the value of 3 parameters in particular : the @xmath9 in the x and y coordinates and of two other defined parameters , the so - called `` demagnification factor '' and `` chromaticity quality factor '' .",
    "all three benchmark parameters have been somewhat relaxed in response to feed - back  @xcite from the studies by final focus lattice experts at hemc99 .",
    "further explicit magnet lattice designs , now for each of the three parameter sets in table 1 , would be invaluable for assessing whether the new , more relaxed parameters have reached an acceptable level of plausibility * the average beam currents and resulting beam powers were reduced so that the worst case , at 100 tev , had a summed beam plus synchrotron power of 180 mw , i.e. comparable to the 170 mw beam power that has been under consideration for the accelerator production of tritium project  @xcite * the beam - beam tune disruption parameter was lowered slightly for all three sets to a value , in the worst case , of @xmath10 .",
    "this is not far above the impressive new lep ii record of @xmath11 that was reported in this conference  @xcite .",
    "the unavoidable cost of these relaxed machine parameters was to lower the luminosity to @xmath12 @xmath13 for each of the 10 , 30 and 100 tev parameters .",
    "this is a reduction to 30% of the luminosities , @xmath14 @xmath13 , of the corresponding hemc99 parameter sets for 10 tev and 100 tev . to put this in perspective ,",
    "the new luminosities are still orders of magnitude higher than at any existing colliders and are also higher than any speculated parameters the author is aware of for plausible future machines other than muon colliders .",
    "the extremely high constituent particle energies and luminosities of the parameter sets presented in table 1 continue to emphasize the impressive potential of muon colliders for exploring the energy frontier of elementary particle physics .",
    "therefore , further paper studies and simulations for many - tev muon colliders should continue to play a valuable role in our field . more specifically",
    ", the parameter sets presented in this paper would certainly benefit from feed - back and constructive criticism by experts in areas such as the design of final focus lattices .",
