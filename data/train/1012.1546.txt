    "<S> the heating of carriers in an intrinsic graphene under an abrupt switching off a dc electric field is examined taking into account both the energy relaxation via acoustic and optic phonons and the interband generation - recombination processes . </S>",
    "<S> the later are caused by the interband transitions due to optical phonon modes and thermal radiation . </S>",
    "<S> description of the temporal and steady - state responses , including the nonequilibrium concentration and energy as well as the current - voltage characteristics , is performed . at room temperature , a nearly - linear current - voltage characteristic and a slowly - varied concentration take place for fields up to @xmath020 kv / cm . </S>",
    "<S> since a predominant recombination of high - energy carriers due to optical phonon emission at low temperatures , a depletion of concentration takes place below @xmath0250 k. for lower temperatures the current tends to be saturated and a negative differential conductivity appears below @xmath0170 k in the region of fields @xmath010 v / cm . </S>"
