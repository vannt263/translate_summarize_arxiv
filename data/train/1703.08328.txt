    "the superconductor ( sc ) @xmath3 has attracted much attention as a topological sc , since exotic quantum states such as a majorana state are expected in the vortex and surface states .",

    "the helical @xmath0-wave state also has been suggested as another scenario  @xcite .",
    "this is because the detailed structure of @xmath4-vector in @xmath3 remains unclear .",
    "in addition , the difference of condensation energy between chiral and helical states is very small compared to the transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need methods to distinguish between chiral and helical states in experiments for @xmath3 or other candidate materials for spin - triplet sc . for the purpose ,",
    "it is necessary that we study a unique behavior of physical quantity depending on the symmetry of @xmath4-vector .    in the bulk state of chiral sc ,",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is broken because of the angular momentum of cooper pair @xmath5 .",
    "the chirality of chiral @xmath0-wave state , i.e. , @xmath6 can be distinguished via coherence effect in the vortex state .",
    "in fact , previous theories suggested that the impurity effects on the local density of states ( ldos ) and local nmr relaxation rate @xmath7 show different behaviors between @xmath8 and @xmath9 states  @xcite .",
    "this chirality dependence is caused by the interaction between the chirality and the vorticity , depending on whether the chirality is parallel ( @xmath10 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath11 ) to the vorticity @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the bulk state of helical @xmath0-wave sc , the time - reversal - invariant superconductivity appears since @xmath6 are quenched with the degeneracy between up - spin and down - spin pairs . the up - spin ( down - spin ) pair s order - parameter @xmath13 characterized by @xmath14 has chirality @xmath15 so that the bulk condition @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the vortex state of helical @xmath0-wave sc , spin states of low - energy excitations may show a unique behavior , reflecting the vorticity coupling to the chirality of @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) measurement can directly detect the ldos via excitations in the vortex state  @xcite .",
    "recently , the stm / sts measurement in the vortex state of topological insulator - superconductor @xmath19 heterostructure has performed  @xcite , and theoretical studies for the measurement have supported the existence of majorana zero - energy mode in the vortex core  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "spin polarization of majorana zero - energy modes are investigated by the spin - polarized stm / sts measurement , which can selectively detect the spin - dependent conductance  @xcite .",
    "the spin polarization in the vortex state of topological sc @xmath20 is also theoretically studied  @xcite .    in this paper , we study properties of the helical @xmath0-wave sc , and focus on the spin - polarized ldos in the vortex lattice state , in order to reveal a unique behavior of the helical state . in particular , we calculate the structure of the zero - energy spin - polarized ldos at low fields , and also the energy spectra .",
