    "superconductors with broken symmetries , such as broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite or broken spin - rotation symmetry @xcite , have attracted great attention . in particular , the role of crystal structure in the emergence of unconventional superconducting states has been studied extensively in recent years . in superconductors with an inversion center in the crystal structure , either an even - parity spin - singlet or an odd - parity spin - triplet superconducting state is realized . however , in non - centrosymmetric superconductors , a parity - mixed superconducting state is allowed and an antisymmetric spin - orbit coupling ( asoc ) interaction is induced@xcite .",
    "the parity - mixing extent is determined by the strength of the asoc .",
    "indeed , some non - centrosymmetric superconductors show novel features .",
    "for example , the isostructural li@xmath11pd@xmath12b and li@xmath11pt@xmath12b show contrasting behaviors .",
    "li@xmath11pd@xmath12b exhibits conventional bcs - type properties@xcite , while li@xmath11pt@xmath12b is a spin - triplet dominant superconductor @xcite with nodes in the gap function @xcite . in this case , a different asoc due to the difference of peculiar crystal structure distortion and atomic number were responsible for the different superconducting states@xcite . after the discovery of spin - triplet superconductivity in li@xmath11pt@xmath12b",
    ", extensive studies have been performed to search for novel superconductivity in non - centrosymmetric superconductors containing heavy elements such as mg@xmath13ir@xmath14b@xcite , bipd@xcite , and scirp@xcite , but parity - mixing is found to be weak @xcite , due to the crystal structure that does not lead to strong asoc enhancement .",
    "recently , more novel properties were reported in some non - centrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "for example , a small internal magnetic field was detected below  in non - centrosymmetric lanic@xmath11 , which was interpreted as due to a breaking of time reversal symmetry in the superconducting state@xcite , although a relation between the breaking of inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry is unclear .",
    "non - centrosymmetric re@xmath0zr is a new candidate of time reversal symmetry - breaking superconductor .",
    "re@xmath0zr has an @xmath15-mn type cubic crystal structure with space group @xmath16@xcite and a large upper critical field close to pauli limit@xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the @xmath15-mn type crystal structure , which has four independent crystallographic sites mn i : 2@xmath17 ( wyckoff ) , @xmath18 ( hermann - mauguin ) , mn ii : 8@xmath19 , @xmath20 , mn iii : 24@xmath21 , @xmath22 , and mn iv : 24@xmath23 , @xmath22 @xcite . among them , only the mn i ( 2a , @xmath18 ) site has an inversion center . an internal magnetic field was detected in the superconducting state by muon spin relaxation or rotation ( @xmath24sr ) measurements@xcite .",
    "the result was ascribed to broken time reversal symmetry in the superconducting state .",

    "furthermore , re has two isotopes @xmath40re ( natural abundance 37.5% ) and @xmath41re ( 62.5% ) . as a result , eight peaks for this compound are expected in principle . however , the difference in the nuclear quadrupole moment @xmath42 of @xmath40re ( @xmath43 @xmath44 ) and @xmath41re ( @xmath45 @xmath44 ) is only 4% , which lead to the inability of distinguishing @xmath40re from @xmath41re in the broad spectra and thus only four peaks were observed . as can be seen in fig .",

    "the intensity for the uppermost peak does not agree with the simulation , probably due to a worse quality factor of the coil in this frequency range .",
