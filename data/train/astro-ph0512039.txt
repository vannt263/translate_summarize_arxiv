    "a universe dominated by normal mass should undergo deceleration as it expands .",
    "thus , the counter - intuitive discovery of an accelerating universe based on observations of type  ia supernovae @xcite is of profound significance for physics .",
    "evidently `` dark energy , '' in the form of einstein s cosmological constant or a more general scalar energy field , is the dominant mass / energy constituent of the universe today .",
    "these important implications depend critically on the quality of the light curves of the type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia , hereafter ) and the ability to k - correct , deredden , and normalize these to a standard luminosity .",
    "the evidence for an accelerating universe is based on a differential measurement between local and distant sne  ia ( at lookback times of 410 gyr ) .",
    "the local samples are very heterogeneous , and as more sne have been added , the full sample dispersion around the local hubble flow has increased from 0.12 @xcite to 0.18 mag @xcite in units of distance modulus . moreover , there are still legitimate concerns about possible systematic errors due to poorly understood photometric systems @xcite , reddening corrections @xcite , and evolutionary effects @xcite . a new and larger sample of nearby ( @xmath1 ) sne , where these sources of observational error have been duly accounted for , is urgently needed .    with that purpose in mind ,",
    "we have initiated a five - year program , the carnegie supernova project ( hereafter csp ) , to obtain well - calibrated optical and near - infrared light curves as well as optical spectrophotometry of @xmath2250 type  ia and core - collapse sne .",
    "the csp is built upon the unique resources of the las campanas observatory ( lco ) in chile .",
    "we have guaranteed access to large numbers of nights on the swope 1  m and the dupont 2.5  m telescopes ( @xmath2300 per year in both telescopes together ) , which are equipped with high - performance ccd optical imagers , near - infrared ( nir ) cameras , and ccd optical spectrographs .",
    "in addition to providing densely sampled light curves covering the near - ultraviolet to the nir ( @xmath0 ) , we have the means to obtain optical spectrophotometry at approximately weekly intervals . the csp is a follow - up project and relies on sne discovered in the course of other surveys .",
    "a large fraction of our targets come from the lick observatory supernova search @xcite conducted with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) , and from dedicated sn searches by amateur astronomers ( e.g. , tim puckett , tom boles , berto monard , koichi itagaki ) , which constitute a growing source of nearby sne .",
    "the targets selected for the follow - up observations by the csp are sne discovered before or near maximum light with @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath5 + 20@xmath6 .",
    "the primary goal of the csp is to establish a fundamental data set of optical and nir light curves in a well - defined and well - understood photometric system for all types of sne .",
    "a secondary goal is to obtain complementary optical spectrophotometry for these same sne .",
    "the data set for the type  ia events will allow us to improve extinction corrections and to investigate systematic effects possibly due to differences in age and metallicity . the data for the type  ii  sne will be used to establish and refine precise techniques for measuring luminosity distances employing the expanding photosphere method @xcite or the standardized candle method @xcite , thereby providing an independent check on the type  ia results .",
    "we will be able to explore the use of both sn types for studies of local galaxy flows and independently measure the convergence depth ( the distance at which the bulk flows smooth out into the so - called large - scale hubble flow ) .",
    "ultimately , the data set will serve as a reference for observations of distant sne that will be obtained in coming years in the course of the joint dark energy mission @xcite and those being obtained in the course of the high-@xmath7 sn surveys such as the cfht legacy project @xcite , essence @xcite , and our own high-@xmath7 component of the csp which seeks to measure rest - band @xmath8 magnitudes of sne  ia at @xmath9 using the magellan telescopes @xcite .",
    "the low-@xmath7 csp data set will also allow us to gain a deeper understanding of the physics of thermonuclear ( type  ia ) events and the different classes of core - collapse sne ( types  ii ,  ib ,  ic ) .",
    "for example , during the first csp observing campaign , we obtained excellent coverage of sn  2005bf , a peculiar , luminous type  ic event which peaked 35 days after explosion and which may represent a transition object between the sne associated with gamma - ray bursts and ordinary sne  ib @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe the low-@xmath7 csp experiment , to explain the general procedures for data acquisition and reduction , to summarize the results obtained during the first ( 20042005 ) low-@xmath7 csp observing campaign , and to present the data for a few representative sne . in @xmath10 [ inst ]",
    "we discuss the instrumentation , in @xmath10 [ obs ] we describe our observations , in @xmath10 [ red ] we explain the data reduction procedures , and in @xmath10 [ res ] we show representative light curves and spectra obtained thus far .",
    "a large fraction of our targets come from the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) which discovers approximately 50% of the low-@xmath7  sne found annually .",
    "although loss is conducted at northern latitudes , in 2004 the search was adjusted to include more galaxies south of the celestial equator , and thus accessible to the carnegie telescopes . over half of the current loss sne",
    "are located south of @xmath4=+20@xmath6 and are observable from lco .",
    "the discovery redshift limit , @xmath11 , of the loss sne is ideally matched to the telescopes and detectors available to the csp .",
    "the rest of the targets come from a variety of searches carried out by amateur astronomers at different observatories .",
    "the telescopes employed to date for the csp are the swope 1.0  m , dupont 2.5  m and , to a lesser extent , the magellan 6.5  m telescopes at lco .",
    "in addition , some spectra have been obtained with the 1.5  m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "various telescopes at lick observatory have also been used for photometry and spectroscopy ( e.g. , foley et al . 2003 ) , but those observations will be described in separate papers .    in the remainder of this section , we describe the instrumentation used with these telescopes .",
    "table [ tab_inst ] lists the instruments used for the low-@xmath7 csp .",
    "the vast majority of the csp optical imaging is being obtained with the swope 1  m @xmath12/7 telescope direct ccd camera , which uses a @xmath13 pixel , 15 @xmath14 m pixel@xmath15 site ccd .",
    "this detector has a readout noise of 6.6 e@xmath16 and a gain of 2.5 e@xmath16  adu@xmath15 ( where adu means analog - to - digital units ) . to speed up the ccd readout and save disk space , we limit the readout to @xmath17 pixels . at a scale of @xmath18",
    "pixel@xmath15 , this corresponds to a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath19 .",
    "the quality of images obtained at the swope telescope ranges from @xmath21@xmath20 full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , with an average seeing of @xmath21 .    for our optical passbands we utilize sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath22 filters in addition to johnson @xmath23 and @xmath24 filters @xcite .",
    "we have chosen sdss filters because we feel it is likely that this will be the dominant photometric filter set for the next decade due to the all - sky photometric maps of sdss ( north ) and the mount stromlo and siding spring observatories skymapper project ( south ) .",
    "we decided not to use the @xmath25 filter because the red side of the filter is determined by the ccd quantum efficiency ( qe ) and not solely by the filter bandpass .",
    "the ccd red response is very temperature sensitive , causing the combined filter - plus - detector throughput to be variable .",
    "the @xmath25 bandpass also overlaps with a saturated h@xmath26o band at 9,300  , adding further uncertainty to its total throughput and effective wavelength .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 filters were included in our program to sample the spectral region covered by the @xmath27 filter with somewhat narrower filters , and to facilitate comparison of our results with historical data sets .",
    "our sdss filters were manufactured by asahi spectra company limited as specified in table [ tab_filters ] .",
    "we have synthesized natural system passbands by combining the filter transmissions with the ccd qe , two aluminum reflectivity curves ( one for the primary and another for the secondary mirror ) , and an atmospheric transmission spectrum .",
    "the resulting sdss bandpasses are shown in the upper panel of figure [ filters_fig ] along with the standard bandpasses ( normalized at maximum ) for the usno 40-inch telescope .",
    "this comparison reveals an excellent match between both systems , with the exception that our @xmath28 bandpass is somewhat narrower than that used at the usno ; the effective wavelength is , however , unchanged .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ filters_fig ] compares the passbands for our harris @xmath23 and @xmath24 filters with the johnson @xmath23 and @xmath24 passbands described by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that our instrumental system provides a reasonable match to the johnson system .",
    "since one of our goals is to eliminate systematic errors in the sn magnitudes caused by differences between the instrumental and the standard bandpasses , we have started a program of regular measurements of the transmission of our filters using a spectrometer at lco .",
    "similarly , we are planning in the near future to improve the measurement of the qe curve for the swope ccd using equipment available for this purpose at the ctio laboratories .",
    "our natural - system bandpasses will be regularly updated as we improve our measurements of the ccd qe , the mirror reflectivities , and other optical elements of our instrument .",
    "all of these will be posted on the csp web site and made available through the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "some @xmath29 imaging has also been obtained with the wide field re - imaging ccd camera ( wfccd ) on the 2.5  m @xmath12/7.5 dupont telescope .",
    "this uses a @xmath30 pixel tektronix ccd with 24 @xmath14 m pixels .",
    "a subraster is used to observe a @xmath31 fov at a scale of @xmath32 pixel@xmath15 .",
    "likewise , a small amount of @xmath33 imaging has been taken with the low - dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-2 ) @xcite on the 6.5  m @xmath12/11 magellan clay telescope .",
    "until the end of 2004 , this instrument employed a site ccd for which we limited the readout to a section of @xmath34 pixels containing a circular fov of @xmath35 diameter .",
    "the pixel size of 15 @xmath14 m corresponds to a scale @xmath36 pixel@xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath33 filter specifications for this instrument are given in table [ tab_filters ] .",
    "in february 2005 , the ldss-2 instrument underwent a significant upgrade which involved replacement of both the optics and the detector .",
    "the new ccd is an sta0500a detector with @xmath37 pixels which , in combination with the new optics , has a scale of @xmath38 pixel@xmath15 .",
    "the upgraded instrument , now called ldss-3 , retains the same @xmath23 filter used in ldss-2 , but the @xmath24 and @xmath39 filters were replaced by sdss @xmath40 and @xmath25 filters . although we have not yet employed ldss-3 for the csp , we expect to do so occasionally in the future .    for galaxy subtraction ,",
    "we need template images after the sn has faded .",
    "these will be obtained beginning in november 2005 with the direct ccd camera on the 2.5  m dupont telescope .",
    "the detector is the same one used with the wfccd , and covers a fov of @xmath41 with a scale of @xmath42 pixel@xmath15 . with a typical image quality of @xmath43 ( fwhm ) at the dupont telescope",

    ", we obtained 85% of the nir images with the wide field infrared camera ( wirc ) on the 2.5  m dupont telescope @xcite , but this situation will change when a new nir camera , retrocam , becomes available at the swope telescope for the second campaign ( see @xmath10 [ future_sec ] ) .",

    "we collected data with no major interruption during our first campaign between september 2004 and may 2005 . during this period",
    ", the csp was allocated 190 nights on the 1  m telescope for optical imaging .",
    "we also had 57 nights on the 2.5  m telescope , of which 33 were for nir imaging , 19 for optical spectroscopy , and 5 for optical imaging .",
    "strict observing procedures were established in order to obtain the data in the most homogeneous manner possible .",
    "as soon as a report of a sn candidate was received , we triggered the follow - up program to begin generally the same night , even without a spectroscopic type or age .",
    "if a spectrum later revealed that the sn had been caught after maximum light we dropped the object from our list of targets .",
    "sometimes it took a while ( @xmath52 weeks ) to obtain the sn spectrum , and in such cases , we used the photometric information collected by us to evaluate its probable type or age .",
    "for these purposes we devised a pipeline to produce preliminary light curves . at any given time we generally had 15 objects on our target list .",
    "we have divided the labor of our project into three working groups , each one having two individuals responsible for ( 1 ) maintaining the observing instructions and procedures up to date , ( 2 ) sending the prioritized list of targets to the observers , ( 3 ) developing data reduction software , and ( 4 ) reducing the data immediately following the night .",
    "observers were responsible for ( 1 ) checking the observing program for the night , ( 2 ) taking data and calibration images , ( 3 ) saving the data on storage media , ( 4 ) preparing a nightly observing report , and ( 5 ) updating the observing log for each sn .",
    "a fluid interaction and communication between the working group leader and the observers allowed us to optimize the telescope time , detect problems with the instrumentation , obtain excellent data , and reduce them promptly .",
    "we designed and implemented a web site for the project which can be found at + http://csp1.lco.cl/@xmath2cspuser1/. the sn list , finding charts , observing procedures , observing programs , data reduction manuals , and many useful tools are available at this url .",
    "this web site is also open to the public , where the photometric evolution of the objects we are following can be seen .    in what follows",
    "we describe the specific observations that each of the working groups gathered during the first low-@xmath7 csp campaign .",
    "optical imaging with the 1  m swope telescope would typically begin during the daytime by taking bias frames , as well as dome flats for each of the @xmath66 filters with exposure times chosen to achieve @xmath223,000 e@xmath16 per pixel . immediately after sunset",
    ", we would observe the twilight sky with the @xmath67 filter , followed by sky flats with two or three additional filters .",
    "generally , 35 images were obtained per filter , making sure to offset the telescope between the individual images .",
    "the telescope was then focused using the @xmath24 filter . for the remaining five filters",
    ", we would use previously derived focus offsets relative to the @xmath24 filter .    during the night",
    ", sne were observed according to the priorities previously assigned by the head of the optical - imaging working group , who determined exposure times based on the source brightness ( typically @xmath68 mag ) and our requirement to achieve 3% photometry . in general",
    "we would observe the sne in all six filters , taking one image per filter .",
    "however , given that we usually had more objects to observe than telescope time available , we would drop the 3% precision requirement for the faintest objects and , in such cases , limit the exposure time to 900 s. when the resulting photometric precision reached 0.2 mag , we discontinued the observations through that filter .",
    "this would happen first in the @xmath67 filter , typically at a magnitude of @xmath221 .",
    "johnson and sdss standards @xcite were observed regularly during photometric nights . at the beginning of the first campaign ,",
    "few science targets were available so we observed 1113 standard fields per night .",
    "as the campaign unfolded and more targets became active , we limited these observations to 45 fields . in all cases",
    ", we spread the observations of the standards over an airmass range of 12 for extinction determinations .",
    "the exposure times were 3120  s depending on the filter used and the brightnesses of the stars .",
    "the purpose of these observations was to calibrate local standard stars in the field of each sn so that later on we could do differential photometry of the sn relative to them .    during cloudy nights , we performed detailed shutter timing and linearity tests on the swope telescope .",
    "the results can be found in appendix [ shutter_app ] and appendix [ linearity_app ] .",
    "the observations with wfccd and ldss-2 were performed in a way similar to those with the swope telescope , except that we did not observe standard stars . we expect to observe standard fields in the future with the purpose of deriving color terms for the filters used .",
    "we did not measure the ccd responses and the shutter corrections for these instruments , but we expect to do so in the future for the wfccd ( the ldss-2 is no longer operational ) .      calibration images for wirc and panic were usually taken just after closing the dome at the end of the night . typically the observer would obtain 15 dark frames with exposure times matching those of the science objects , 15 dome flats per filter with the dome lights on ( with @xmath220,000 e@xmath16  pixel@xmath15 ) , followed by 15 dome flats with the lights off .",
    "final dome flats were constructed from the `` lights - on '' images minus the `` lights - off '' images .",
    "this procedure was found to be preferable , especially at @xmath54 , to using dark - subtracted `` lights - on '' dome flats since contributions to the flux from additive sources were removed correctly .",
    "the latter sources include the camera window , telescope mirrors , and scattered thermal emission which illuminate the detector differently than does the flat - field screen .    for wirc",
    ", we obtained twilight flats on some nights to test the illumination quality of the dome flats .",
    "these tests showed agreement between twilight and dome flats within 1% for all four nir passbands .",
    "however for panic , it was necessary to take twilight flats for illumination corrections to bring the photometric flatness to better than 2% .",
    "we took twilight flats every night in sets of at least five exposures per filter , offsetting the telescope between exposures , and controlling the flux level to be in the linear regime .",
    "we used dome flats for both wirc and panic to build bad - pixel masks for each night .    for the wirc observations , we preselected the telescope pointing for each sn such that there were a number of good local calibration stars in the field",
    ". thus the sn was not always centered in the detector .",
    "we started observing each sn by placing it on detector # 2 and taking a sequence of dithered exposures in one of the filters .",
    "usually we used nine dither positions in a @xmath69 square pattern , but when the sn was bright enough we used only five positions .",
    "we set the exposure time of the individual images to 20 , 30 , or 45 s , depending on the brightness of the sn .",
    "occasionally , for the faintest sne , we repeated the exposures at each dither position .",
    "once the dither sequence was completed , we would offset the sn field to detector # 3 and repeat the sequence for the same filter .",
    "this procedure allowed us to obtain sky images suitable for subtraction for each of the two detectors while observing the object on the other detector .",
    "we usually observed with all four filters , though in the case of faint sne , we dropped the @xmath54 filter because of the large uncertainties introduced by the high background levels that characterize this band .",
    "typical times spent on each target , including overhead , were between one and two hours , with effective exposures between 200 and 800 s in each filter .",
    "there are advantages and weaknesses to this technique .",
    "the advantage is that the nearby galaxies tend to be very large , making it generally impossible to use the median of the dithered sn+galaxy data on a single detector to form a clean sky image with no print - through . the sequence of off - source dithered exposures ( obtained when the sn+galaxy move to the other detector ) , on the other hand , produces a very clean sky image .",
    "the disadvantage is that sometimes the sky may be taken as much as 15 minutes before or after the sn+galaxy exposure , and the nir sky can change over this time .",
    "thus the sky images , while very clean , may have larger residual subtraction features because of changing sky emission levels .    on the photometric wirc nights",
    ", we observed three to five standard stars from @xcite on detector # 2 . for observing efficiency , we based the photometric transformations to the standard system on data obtained with this single detector .",
    "standard stars were observed with five dither positions and three repetitions at each position .",
    "we chose stars with @xmath52 fainter than mag 11 to avoid saturation and fixed the exposure time of individual images to 5 s , resulting in total exposure times of 75 s for each filter .",
    "the photometric transformations derived from these observations were applied to comparison stars in the sn fields ( observed only with detector#2 ) to obtain precise magnitudes for these local standards .    for our panic observations , we selected a slightly different pointing for each sn than that used for wirc in order to include the maximum number of comparison stars in the smaller fov of panic .",
    "observations were made with five dither positions and two or three exposures per position , depending on the sn brightness .",
    "the exposure times for individual images were 10 , 20 , or 30 s with total exposure times ranging between 100 and 450 s. we followed each of these sequences by a sky sequence after offsetting the telescope by one or two arcmin in any direction , making sure that the host galaxy fell outside of the sky field .",
    "our spectroscopic observations typically started during the afternoon by taking bias frames , followed by a series of dispersed dome flats with wide ( @xmath27@xmath70 ) and narrow ( @xmath21@xmath70 ) slits .",
    "in addition , for the wfccd and ldss-2 instruments , dome flats were obtained for the respective imaging filters ( @xmath29 for the wfccd , and @xmath33 for ldss-2 ) .",
    "we adjusted the lamp voltage and the exposure times to obtain 10,000 e@xmath16  pixel@xmath15 in our flat - field direct images , and a maximum of 15,000 e@xmath16  pixel@xmath15 in the spectroscopic flats .",
    "we observed sne with the narrow slit aligned along the parallactic angle @xcite according to a priority list built for every night .",
    "total exposure times with the wfccd and the modular spectrograph varied between 900 and 2700 s , and between 180 and 900 s with ldss-2 .",
    "for each sn , we divided the total exposure into three independent integrations for cosmic - ray rejection . in between the first two or last two exposures , an image of a comparison lamp for wavelength calibration",
    "was taken . during the night we observed at least two spectrophotometric standards @xcite with the wide slit",
    "a few weeks after the beginning of the first campaign , we decided to include one observation per night of a telluric standard @xcite with high s / n and the same narrow slit used for the observations of the sne .",
    "since data from the ctio 1.5  m telescope were obtained in service mode , we were not able to obtain such a calibration with that instrument .",
    "to accelerate and automate the reduction of the optical imaging , we developed a custom iraf script package to handle the swope 1  m data .",
    "for all nights , we first corrected the exposure time for the shutter timing error ( see appendix [ shutter_app ] ) .",
    "next we processed the images through bias subtraction , non - linearity corrections ( see appendix [ linearity_app ] ) , and flat - field division . for a given filter , we constructed the flat field by dividing the median - filtered combined sky flat by the median - filtered combined dome flat , heavily smoothing this ratio , and multiplying this illumination correction into the dome flat .",
    "this procedure removed a small gradient of @xmath21% .",
    "when a nightly sky flat could not be obtained we used one from a previous night .",
    "random checks of science images taken during the night typically showed that the sky level across the images varied by less than 1% .",
    "although fringing is present in the @xmath28 band we did not attempt to remove it from our frames .",
    "since our @xmath28-band instrumental magnitudes of the local standards in the sn fields can be transformed to the standard system ( as explained below ) to better than 0.015 mag , this implies that neglecting the fringing correction introduces an error @xmath5 0.015 mag .",
    "next we used the iraf _ daophot _ package to compute instrumental magnitudes for the standard stars with an aperture of @xmath71 in radius ( the same used in the establishment of the standard system ) , and a sky annulus located 7@xmath72 from the star .",
    "we computed instrumental errors using a poisson model based on the noise parameters of the ccd .",
    "this model provided realistic errors for faint stars , but excessively small errors for bright stars .",
    "we adopted 0.015 mag as the floor to the calculated errors , based on the observed dispersion in the transformation between instrumental and standard magnitudes of bright stars ( see below ) . to derive the transformation of the instrumental magnitudes into the standard system we used the following @xcite :    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78    in these equations @xmath79 ( left - hand side ) are",
    "the published magnitudes in the standard system @xcite , @xmath80 ( right - hand side ) correspond to the natural system magnitudes , @xmath81 is the extinction coefficient , @xmath82 the effective airmass , @xmath83 the color term , and @xmath84 the zero - point for filter @xmath85 .    at the beginning of the first campaign , we observed a standards field hourly ( @xmath220 stars during the night ) , which allowed us to solve for all unknowns ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath81 ) .",
    "as the campaign progressed the pressure to observe sne increased , leaving less time for measurements of standards .",
    "we adopted the approach of measuring only 58 standard stars over a wide range of airmass ( @xmath210 stars during the night ) . with this small number of stars we fixed the color term to the average value , solving only for the extinction coefficient and zero - point .    during the first observing campaign , we obtained weighted least - squares solutions for 53 clear nights .",
    "dispersions around best - fit transformations were @xmath20.020.04 mag in @xmath67 and @xmath20.010.02 mag in other filters .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the excellent quality of the lco site for this photometric program .",
    "figure [ extinct_fig ] shows the extinction coefficients as a function of time for all filters . while the scatter was only @xmath20.03 in @xmath66 , the dispersion was three times greater in the @xmath67 band which is the most sensitive to extinction variations from night to night .",
    "color terms are presented in figure [ pcoef_fig ] .",
    "no obvious secular change was seen over this 250-day span in any filter , even though the primary mirror was washed on 2005 apr .",
    "06 ut . while the color terms were close to zero ( @xmath50.02 ) for @xmath86 , the magnitudes of these terms in @xmath87 were greater ( @xmath20.040.06 ) , indicating small , but non - negligible differences between the instrumental and standard system .    to calibrate the local standards around the sn , we started by selecting the 510 brightest stars in every sn frame .",
    "for each frame , we used these stars to compute aperture photometry and derive the magnitude correction between a small aperture ( generally @xmath88 ) and the @xmath71 aperture employed for the johnson+sdss standards .",
    "the aperture correction was typically @xmath20.030.1 mag .",
    "we assumed there were no field effects in the aperture corrections .",
    "then we computed photometry for 1015 field stars through the small aperture and corrected to the large aperture , bringing the natural system photometry to the @xmath71 radius aperture . while this correction added some complication to the procedure",
    ", it improved the statistical accuracy of the fainter stars .    finally , we used equations [ u_eq][v_eq ] to derive magnitudes in the standard system for the local standards .",
    "the uncertainty in the resulting magnitudes was the poisson error in the instrumental magnitudes ( assuming a minimum error of 0.015 mag ) .",
    "here we neglected the uncertainty in the aperture correction which was always less than 0.01 mag ( otherwise we excluded such measurements ) . from the multiple measurements obtained on different clear nights we took weighted averages , yielding a photometric sequence of secondary standards around each sn with uncertainties as small as 0.004 mag in the individual magnitudes .",
    "we then performed differential photometry of the sn relative to the local standards .",
    "the great advantage of this approach is that , since the sn is observed simultaneously with the field stars , the magnitude differences within a ccd frame are , to first order , immune to the passage of clouds . to improve the instrumental precision",
    ", we performed point - spread - function ( psf ) photometry .",
    "for this purpose , we employed all the stars of the photometric sequence to determine an average psf for every ccd image , and we fitted the resulting psf to the sn and the standards to a radius of @xmath88 .",
    "we converted the instrumental magnitudes to the standard system using equations [ u_eq][v_eq ] , assuming that the extinction effects ( @xmath89 ) were simple additive constants which were absorbed , to first order , by the zero - point .",
    "as shown in figure [ pcoef_fig ] , the color terms had no secular variations and we adopted average color terms , solving only for the photometric zero - points .",
    "the final uncertainty in the sn magnitude was the instrumental error in the psf fit ( assuming a minimum of 0.015 mag , as explained above ) .",
    "we neglected errors due to the transformation to the standard system since the uncertainty in the color term and in the zero - point are well below 0.015 mag .",
    "the extraction of the sn magnitude from a ccd frame is generally uncertain because the sn resides in a host galaxy with unknown features at the sn position .",
    "thus , the light curves computed so far should be considered preliminary .",
    "as soon as we obtain galaxy templates with the 2.5  m telescope , we will use image subtraction to remove the image of the galaxy and obtain definitive light curves .",
    "this procedure will follow that described by @xcite which consists of ( 1 ) using the task `` geomap '' to determine the coordinate transformation between the two images ( assuming a two - dimensional linear polynomial ) and using the task `` geotran '' to register the template to the sn+galaxy image ; ( 2 ) using the task `` psfmatch '' to find the two - dimensional difference kernel that , when convolved with the template , matches the psf of the sn+galaxy image ; ( 3 ) using the task `` linmatch '' to match the flux scale of the template to that of the sn+galaxy image ; ( 4 ) subtracting the modified template from the sn+galaxy image ; and ( 5 ) extracting a small box around the sn from the subtracted image and inserting it in the original sn+galaxy image .    the custom script package developed for the swope telescope",
    "was used also to process the wfccd and ldss-2 data through the flat - field division .",
    "we have not attempted yet to compute sn magnitudes for these instruments because the lack of standard observations has prevented us from calculating color terms .",
    "this will be remedied during the second campaign .",
    "we reduced both wirc and panic data using software pipelines .",
    "these pipelines are a combination of iraf scripts following the steps of ( 1 ) linearity correction , ( 2 ) dark combination and subtraction , ( 3 ) flat - field combination and division , ( 4 ) bad - pixel mask production , ( 5 ) sky image computation and subtraction , and ( 6 ) combination of dithered frames into final stacked images .",
    "both pipelines work in a similar fashion , with slight differences due to differing observing procedures .    in the first step ,",
    "we applied a predetermined linearity correction law for the hawaii-1 detectors to every pixel value above 16,000 e@xmath16 :    @xmath90    where @xmath8 is the observed number of adu , @xmath91 is the corrected value , and the coefficients are set to @xmath92e@xmath93 , @xmath94e@xmath95 , and @xmath96e@xmath97 .",
    "next , we normalized the dark - subtracted dome flats by the median .",
    "we considered pixel values outside the range 0.61.67 to be unrealistic , replacing them by 1 in the normalized flat and marking them in the nightly bad - pixel mask . if sky flats were taken ( as was usually the case for panic ) , we median combined them and normalized the result to an average value of 1.0 , replacing pixel values outside the range 0.25 by 1 .",
    "we checked the results for possible residual stars . in the case of wirc , we preferred sky flats ( when available ) to dome flats and we used them to check the illumination quality of the latter , which was usually good to within 1% for all filters . in the case of panic ,",
    "dome flats showed illumination gradients of about 5% to 10% across the image . therefore , when sky flats could not be obtained , we used ones from a previous night .",
    "we stored all combined darks , flats , and bad - pixel masks of a night for future use or examination .",
    "sky frames to be subtracted from individual object frames were then constructed .",
    "we combined off - target images to produce sky frames in a two - step process .",
    "first , we computed a sky frame by directly averaging all off - target images .",
    "we subtracted this first sky frame from the individual off - target images .",
    "we detected objects in the subtracted frames and masked them in the original frames .",
    "we recalculated the sky frame , scaling the images to a common mode .",
    "we scaled the sky to the mode of the individual ( dithered ) object frames and subtracted it from them .",
    "we computed also the mode of the object frame in a two - step process to eliminate the contribution of sources in the image .",
    "we obtained the final image by aligning and averaging the individual object frames . in this process , we preserved all pixels except those marked in the bad - pixel mask . because the images may have been taken in non - photometric conditions",
    ", we trimmed the data to only the regions of complete overlap .",
    "we generally obtained two images per sn and filter with wirc ( one from detector # 2 , and another from detector # 3 ) , and one image with panic .    once the pipelines had produced stacked science images , we proceeded with the photometric measurements .",
    "every time standard stars were observed with wirc , we measured instrumental magnitudes through a standard aperture of @xmath98 in radius @xcite , with a sky annulus at @xmath98 to @xmath71 from the star .",
    "the magnitudes carried associated statistical uncertainties based on a poisson model of the noise .",
    "as with the optical photometry , these estimates turned out to be unrealistically small when the objects were bright . based on the dispersion found in the photometric solutions ( see below ) , we estimate the minimum error in a single measurement to be 0.02 mag .",
    "this was our adopted minimum uncertainty in the instrumental magnitudes .",
    "we used the instrumental magnitudes of standard stars to solve for the photometric transformation of the night , defined by the following equations :    @xmath99    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    here , @xmath59 are the magnitudes in the standard system ( the @xmath103 magnitudes published by @xcite and the @xmath51 magnitudes given in appendix [ yband_app ] ) , @xmath104 are the corresponding instrumental magnitudes , @xmath81 is the extinction coefficient , @xmath82 the effective airmass , and @xmath84 the zero - point for filter @xmath85 .",
    "we fixed the extinction coefficients for @xmath103 to the canonical values given by @xcite : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 . in the case of @xmath51",
    ", we used the same value as for @xmath52 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we employed a weighted least - squares method to find the zero - points @xmath84 .",
    "typical dispersions around the fits were @xmath20.020.03 mag for all filters . on six nights , we observed 45 standards spread over airmass 12 in order to also fit the extinction coefficients .",
    "we found no significant deviations from the nominal values for @xmath103 . in the @xmath51 band we found an average of @xmath109 , in agreement with the value of @xmath110 given by @xcite .",
    "note that we assumed zero color terms since the instrument detector and filters were essentially the same as in @xcite .",
    "we will verify and monitor this assumption during the course of future campaigns .    with the photometric solution for the night",
    ", we proceeded to calibrate the local standard stars in each sn field observed with detector # 2 of wirc .",
    "we started by measuring magnitudes of bright , isolated stars through apertures of @xmath62 to @xmath98 in every stacked science frame and deriving the magnitude correction between a @xmath20 and a @xmath98 radius aperture .",
    "typical aperture corrections ranged between 0.02 and 0.1 mag .",
    "we kept this correction below 0.1 mag by increasing the size of the small aperture , if necessary .",
    "since the uncertainty in the aperture correction was generally @xmath20.02 mag , the increase in the statistical uncertainty on the @xmath20 measured magnitude was marginal and certainly lower than that introduced by increasing the aperture to @xmath98 .",
    "we measured magnitudes for a number of comparison stars ( between 3 and 15 ) in each sn field through the small aperture and corrected them to the @xmath98 aperture .",
    "we transformed these instrumental magnitudes to the standard system using equations ( [ y_eq ] ) to ( [ k_eq ] ) .",
    "the weighted averaged of the resulting magnitudes for all comparison stars obtained on different photometric nights was calculated and checked for consistency .",
    "we then computed sn magnitudes relative to comparison stars in a manner identical to that used for the optical data .",
    "the first step in the spectroscopic reductions was to combine the bias and flat - field images , and then process the science frames through overscan subtraction , trimming , bias correction , and flat - fielding .",
    "next , a general wavelength calibration was derived for the night , which we used later as a starting point to obtain specific calibrations from the comparison lamp images obtained at the position of each sn .",
    "our wavelength calibrations were typically characterized by a root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter of 0.1 pixel .",
    "the sensitivity function for the night was then calculated .",
    "this procedure consisted of extracting 1-d spectra of the flux standards , applying the wavelength calibration , dividing them by the 1-d telluric standard spectrum ( after eliminating by hand the weak intrinsic spectral features of such stars ) , and calculating a response curve based on the flux values measured for the standard stars .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite ( see also matheson et al . 2000 ) , the division by the telluric spectrum has the following advantages : ( 1 ) it effectively removes the high - frequency ( 10250 pixel wavelength ) wiggles in the spectrum that are introduced by typical flat - field continuum sources and which can have a higher frequency than the flux point spacing , especially in the red , ( 2 ) the response curve can be fit accurately with a low - order function , and ( 3 ) most of the telluric features disappear , except those which are strongly saturated ( like the oxygen band near 7,600  ) .",
    "the latter effect is very important in revealing the calcium , oxygen , and carbon features in the red .",
    "extraction of the sn spectra was accomplished using a window whose width was chosen depending on the seeing and the uniformity of the underlying galaxy distribution . typically the window included @xmath290% of the sn flux and excluded the wings of the stellar profile where the contribution of the galaxy introduced unwanted noise .",
    "we used two adjacent windows along the spatial direction to estimate the sky level and the contribution of the galaxy in the sn aperture .",
    "in general we tried to select these background windows as close as possible to the sn aperture , but the criteria for their selection varied from case to case depending on the nature of the adjacent background .",
    "a cubic spline was used to interpolate the background at the sn position . in most cases",
    "this interpolation provided an accurate estimate of the actual background , but occasionally the background was so non - uniform that some contamination of the host galaxy in the 1-d sn spectrum was unavoidable .",
    "the extracted 1-d sn spectrum was then wavelength calibrated using the comparison lamp exposure taken at the sn position .",
    "finally , the wavelength - calibrated spectra were divided by the 1-d telluric spectrum , and the sensitivity function was applied .",
    "multiple observations of the same sn were combined into a final spectrum using a median - filter algorithm to remove deviant pixels caused by cosmic rays .",
    "during the first low-@xmath7 csp campaign , we observed a total of 72 sne .",
    "however , only 38 of these ( 17 sne  ia , 12 sne  ii , and 9 sne  ibc ) eventually qualified for inclusion in our follow - up program .",
    "this number represents 76% of our nominal expectation of @xmath250 sne , with the difference being ascribed to natural variations in the year - to - year sn discovery rates .      during the first campaign",
    ", we obtained 7852 science optical images , and established photometric sequences around all of the 38 sne included in our follow - up observations .",
    "final light curves must await the eventual subtraction of template images , but we present here preliminary light curves obtained with the swope telescope of two sne that did not suffer significant contamination from their hosts .",
    "while we chose these sne for minimal contamination , the effect is bound to appear at some point when the sne became very faint .",
    "nevertheless , these examples illustrate the excellent photometric quality of the csp light curves .",
    "figure [ sn04eo_opt_fig ] shows the @xmath79 light curves of the type  ia  sn  2004eo .",
    "we observed this object for @xmath280 days starting @xmath210 days before maximum light with a cadence rarely achieved in previous studies . to estimate the precision of our photometry we fit a lgendre polynomial to the light curves with the lowest possible order but making sure to eliminate systematic residuals . in this case , the scatter around the fits amounts to 0.028 ( order 8) , 0.012 ( order 9 ) , 0.006 ( order 12 ) , 0.012 ( order 15 ) , 0.010 ( order 9 ) , and 0.008 ( order 10 ) mag in @xmath111 , and @xmath24 , respectively . these dispersions can be taken as an empirical and realistic estimate of the random error in a single observation .    in figure [ sn04fx_opt_fig ] we present optical light curves for the type  ii plateau sn  2004fx . a pre - discovery image on 2004 oct .",
    "22 , where the sn was not visible , indicates that the sn was caught no later than 20 days after explosion .",
    "our first observations confirm that the sn was still quite blue at that point and that it grew progressively redder .",
    "we observed the sn on a weekly basis through the plateau phase for @xmath280 days , every other night for the next 20 days as it evolved faster , and less frequently again during the linear phase .",
    "the scatter in @xmath67 about a fourth - order lgendre polynomial is 0.10 mag , but this is dominated by the last few points where the statistical uncertainties are much greater . when the four points with the greatest residuals are removed , the scatter drops to 0.044 mag . in the other bands , the scatter during the plateau phase around an order 10 lgendre polynomial varies between 0.02 and 0.03 mag . during the late - time linear phase",
    "the dispersion around a linear fit varies between 0.03 and 0.10 mag in @xmath112 .",
    "part of this scatter is caused by variable amounts of galaxy contamination as the seeing varied during the observations .",
    "we expect the final light curves to be much more uniform at these late epochs .      during the first campaign",
    ", we obtained thousands of individual nir images .",
    "the reduction process produced 1449 calibrated mosaics .",
    "we established photometric sequences around all of the 24 sne included in our follow - up observations .",
    "our nir light curves are preliminary , awaiting the final template images and subtraction .",
    "the nir photometry is presented in the @xmath59 light curves for two representative cases .",
    "figure [ sn04ey_ir_fig ] presents the type  ia sn  2004ey , while figure [ sn04fx_ir_fig ] shows the type  ii sn  2004fx . in both cases ,",
    "we show for comparison the @xmath28-band light curves from our own optical follow - up program .",
    "the light curves show the typical sampling achieved of one point every 57 days , with gaps of up to 15 days during lunar `` dark runs '' when wirc was not available at the 2.5  m dupont telescope . by exchanging time with other programs",
    ", we were able to improve the sampling of some light curves , especially in the cases of sne  ia around maximum light , to one point every 12 days .",
    "for sne  ii , we relaxed the frequency of observations to one point every @xmath210 days , enough to follow the slow plateau evolution . from the observations reduced independently for detectors # 2 and # 3 of wirc , we are able to estimate the precision of the measurements . in cases of high s",
    "/ n , where photon uncertainties can be neglected , the deviation between the two points is @xmath20.020.03 mag in the @xmath113 bands , consistent with expectations .",
    "the distinctive secondary maximum of sne  ia is clearly seen in figure [ sn04ey_ir_fig ] , occurring about 20 days after first maximum .",
    "this secondary maximum is remarkably prominent in @xmath51 , even surpassing the brightness of the first maximum .",
    "the nir behavior of the type  ii  sn is characterized by a slow yet steady luminosity increase during the plateau phase , a feature previously seen in sn  1999em @xcite .      during the first csp campaign",
    ", we obtained a total of 213 optical spectra which are fully reduced . during this period we provided spectral classification in the iau circulars for 27 sne .",
    "figure [ sn04ef_z ] displays the spectroscopic evolution of the type  ia  sn  2004ef starting 8 days before maximum light for a period of 47 days .",
    "the telluric features are quite evident in these spectra because we did not obtain telluric standard observations for this sn .",
    "figure [ sn04fx_z ] shows the temporal evolution of the spectrum of the type  ii sn  2004fx . unlike the case for sn  2004ef",
    ", these spectra were divided by a telluric standard .",
    "most telluric features disappear and only small residuals can be seen at the strongest absorptions ( like the `` a band '' near 7,600   ) .",
    "in this paper , we have outlined the basic strategy of the csp . in the second campaign",
    ", we will be modifying small aspects to improve the data quality still further .",
    "the most important addition to the csp will be retrocam , a simple , high - throughput , nir imager that will be mounted continuously on the swope telescope during each sn campaign .",
    "it has a hawaii-1 @xmath55 pixel hgcdte detector , and a single filter wheel containing @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 filters .",
    "because it has no reimaging optics it does not operate in the @xmath54 band .",
    "the scale is @xmath114 pixel@xmath15 , which is adequate for the image quality delivered by the telescope .",
    "retrocam and the ccd camera ( used for all the swope measurements made so far ) will both be mounted on a mechanical `` swivel , '' such that they can be exchanged with each other in a matter of minutes .",
    "typically this will be done during the afternoon , depending on sn scheduling requirements , weather , and so forth .",
    "thus we expect to be able to alternate between @xmath79 and @xmath113 photometry every two or three nights or , in exceptional cases , during the same night .",
    "we expect that the final result will be light curves with comparable density of coverage from @xmath67 through @xmath53 , and with sparser @xmath54 coverage from wirc and panic .    during the first campaign",
    ", we did not have enough engineering or cloudy time on our wirc or panic nights to allow us to perform linearity tests .",
    "hence , we have relied on the corrections that are given in the manuals of these facility instruments .",
    "we will improve this situation by carrying out our own tests during the second campaign .",
    "during the first campaign , it was not always possible to achieve an optimal cadence of one spectroscopic observation every 57 nights per sn .",
    "we expect to improve this situation for future csp campaigns by obtaining supplementary spectroscopic time on the ctio 4  m and the european southern observatory ntt telescopes .",
    "additional spectra will also be obtained at lick observatory .",
    "the low-@xmath7 program of the csp is underway . during the first 9-month campaign , we were assigned 190 nights with the lco 1  m telescope , 57 nights with the 2.5  m telescope , and a smaller number of nights with the two magellan 6.5  m telescopes and the ctio 1.5  m telescope . with this allocation",
    ", we were able to obtain follow - up photometry and spectroscopy for 38 sne ( 17 sne  ia , 12 sne  ii , and 9 sne  ibc ) .",
    "in the first year of operation , we developed reduction pipelines and software which allowed us to produce optical+nir light curves in real time and post them on our public web site .",
    "thanks to the nearly uninterrupted access to the swope 1  m telescope , our optical light curves have an unprecedented gap - free temporal coverage .",
    "this data set constitutes the first ever for sne in the sdss filters .",
    "given that we used only one instrument and filter set , the light curves are very homogeneous in comparison to data sets in the literature such as the `` gold sample '' of @xcite . through careful attention to details , precisions of 0.03 mag in @xmath67 and 0.01 mag in @xmath66 in single measurements have been achieved .",
    "we were able to sample the nir light curves of sne  ia every 57 days with longer gaps of 15 days during dark time , and those of sne  ii every 10 nights .",
    "the precision of single measurements in the @xmath113 bands was typically 0.020.03 mag , consistent with expectations .",
    "our data processing procedures allowed us to flux and wavelength calibrate hundreds of spectra in a timely manner . during the first campaign ,",
    "the csp provided spectroscopic types for 27 sne .",

    ", we took 10@xmath1174 s exposures bracketed by two 1@xmath11740 s images which yielded @xmath115=0.083@xmath1200.003 , and 10@xmath1175 s exposures bracketed by two 1@xmath11750 s images which yielded @xmath115=0.084@xmath1200.003 .",
    "these tests demonstrated that the shutter error was important , especially for short exposure times .",
    "for example , neglect of the correction would have introduced a 0.08 mag error in a 1 s exposure relative to a long one .",
    "note that the uncertainty in this correction is only 0.002 mag in a 1 s exposure and proportionally less for longer exposures .",
    "when the sky was overcast , we used the swope 1  m telescope to measure the linearity of the site ccd . with the dome closed during the night , we pointed the telescope to a white flat - field screen , adjusting the intensity of the quartz lamps to give 100 adu  pixel@xmath15 above the bias in 8 s. then we took exposures of 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 , ... 1800 s , which allowed us to measure the ccd response between 50 and 23,000 adu  pixel@xmath15 ( 57,500 e@xmath16  pixel@xmath15 ) , above which we noticed that the ccd became quite nonlinear .",
    "we bracketed each of these images with 8 s images in order to monitor the illumination drift of the quartz lamp .",
    "we found that the illumination could vary by up to @xmath22% during the 2-hour time span of the measurement sequence .",
    "once we corrected the fluxes for these illumination variations , we fitted a model of the form    @xmath121    where @xmath122 was the flux detected in @xmath123 s.    figure [ nl_fig ] ( top ) shows measurements obtained on 2004 oct . 6 ( filled circles ) and the best - fit model . the bottom panel shows the fractional residuals from the best fit .",
    "although at low - illumination levels the residuals amount to @xmath22% , the cubic polynomial provides a reasonable fit to the ccd response over the whole dynamic range .",
    "a better fit would have been obtained with a higher - order polynomial , but we preferred to avoid an excessive number of free parameters in the model 0.002 mag , thus demonstrating that this correction is unnecessary . ] .",
    "we then proceeded to linearize the observed fluxes on a pixel - by - pixel basis using the formula    @xmath124    the last four rows of table [ tab_coef ] list the resulting coefficients from four different nights when we carried out these linearity measurements .",
    "figure [ lcoeff_fig ] shows the data obtained on 2004 oct .",
    "6 along with the best - fit model ( solid line ) .",
    "note that the departures from linearity reached almost 6% at 23,000 adu , so it was absolutely necessary to correct the data for this effect to achieve high - precision photometry . above this value",
    "the curve shown in figure [ lcoeff_fig ] has a steep upturn , so we find it safer to avoid illuminations above 23,000 adu and define our saturation limit at this value .",
    "included in table [ tab_coef ] are previous measurements of the linearity of the site ccd carried out between may  2001 and may  2004 by janusz kaluzny .",
    "two of these measurements are plotted in figure [ lcoeff_fig ] .",
    "note that the fits shown in figure [ lcoeff_fig ] represent the full range of the linearity corrections that have been measured for the site ccd .",
    "these differences are almost certainly due to errors in the measurements themselves rather than changes in the linearity of the detector .",
    "hence , for the entire first campaign of the csp , we adopted the correction measured on 2004 oct .",
    "6 , which lies in the middle of the range of fits .",
    "the uncertainty in this linearity correction translates to a maximum error in the photometry which is less than 2% .",
    "in @xmath10 [ nir_red ] , the @xmath51-band photometric solution represents a special case , since @xcite only defined the standard @xmath103 system .",
    "the @xmath51-band system has been recently introduced by @xcite . in order to derive @xmath51 magnitudes for all of the persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) standard stars , we defined a relationship between the ( @xmath125 ) and ( @xmath126 ) colors for a series of kurucz model spectra between 3,500 and 10,000 k , log@xmath127 = 4 , and solar abundances . ] .",
    "these models have solar abundances and effective temperatures between 3,500 and 10,000 k , thus producing a grid of spectra for main - sequence star analogs .",
    "we computed synthetic @xmath128 magnitudes for each model using the total system transmission functions for panic shown in figure [ ir_filters_fig ] .",
    "figure [ kurucz_fig ] shows the resulting ( @xmath125 ) vs. ( @xmath126 ) diagram together with the measurements published by @xcite ( their table 2 ) .",
    "the data from @xcite scatter significantly , but in general they follow the synthetic values for @xmath129 mag . for @xmath130 mag",
    ", there is a systematic difference of @xmath20.1 mag in ( @xmath125 ) between the measurements and the models .        where @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "the fit is shown in figure [ kurucz_fig ] in the range of colors for the @xcite standards .",
    "we chose to ignore any zero - point difference and thus defined @xmath138 when @xmath139 in order to maintain the original definition of @xmath140 lyr having 0.00 magnitude at all wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we therefore used the following formula to compute @xmath51-band magnitudes from @xmath52 and @xmath54 for all of the @xcite standards :      as suggested by the referee , we re - computed @xmath51-band magnitudes for the persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) standards using the @xmath142 versus @xmath143 relation yielded by the kurucz models .",
    "the differences in the @xmath51 magnitudes obtained with both methods are never greater than 0.025 mag and the mean difference is 0.006 @xmath120 0.007 mag . we conclude that both approaches ( @xmath51 from @xmath144 and @xmath51 from @xmath145 ) are valid and yield very similar results .",
