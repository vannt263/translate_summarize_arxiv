    "mass outflows  accretion disk winds  from a luminous disk are observed in various active objects , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , supersoft x - ray sources ( ssxss ) , microquasars ( @xmath6qsos ) , broad absorption line quasars ( bal qsos ) , and so on .",
    "radiatively driven wind emanating from an accretion disk is a clue to the formation mechanism of astrophysical jets and winds in these objects ( see kato et al .",
    "1998 , 2007 for a review of accretion disks ) .",
    "so far , radiatively driven outflows from a luminous disk have been extensively studied by many researchers ( bisnovatyi - kogan , blinnikov 1977 ; katz 1980 ; icke 1980 ; melia , knigl 1989 ; misra , melia 1993 ; tajima , fukue 1996 , 1998 ; watarai , fukue 1999 ; hirai , fukue 2001 ; fukue et al .",
    "2001 ; orihara , fukue 2003 ) , and by numerical simulations ( eggum et al . 1985 , 1988 ; kley 1989 ; okuda et al .",
    "1997 ; kley , lin 1999 ; okuda , fujita 2000 ; okuda 2002 ; okuda et al . 2005 ; ohsuga et al .",
    "2005 ; ohsuga 2006 ) . in almost all of these studies , however , the luminous disk was treated as an external radiation source ( optically thin approximation ) , and the radiation transfer in the flow was not solved .",
    "although radiation hydrodynamical equations were solved in the numerical simulations , the methods were rather limited ; e.g. , the equilibrium between gas and radiation was assumed , the flux - limited diffusion approximation was adopted , the flow velocity was subrelativistic on the order of @xmath7 , or the optically thick to thin transition was not properly treated . up to now , in relation to accretion disk winds no one solved the fully relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equations .",
    "recently , radiation hydrodynamical mass outflows have been examined for the first time in the fully relativistic cases for the plane - parallel case ( fukue 2005 , 2006 ; fukue , akizuki 2006 ; see also akizuki and fukue 2007 for the spherical case ) . in these studies , however , the gas pressure was ignored for simplicity , although the relativistic radiation hydrodynamical equations were solved . in this paper , we thus take into account the gas pressure , and obtain the relativistic radiation hydrodynamical _ winds _ browing off from a luminous flat disk within the framework of a fully special relativistic regime .    in the next section",
    "we describe the basic equations in the vertical direction , and examine critical points . in section 3",
    "we obtain transonic winds as well as supersonic ones .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose a luminous flat disk , inside of which gravitational or nuclear energy is released via viscous heating or other processes .",
    "the radiation energy is transported in the vertical direction , and the disk gas , itself , also moves in the vertical direction due to the action of radiation pressure ( steady plane - parallel approximation ) .",
    "we do not consider the rotation of the gas .",
    "as for the order of the flow velocity @xmath8 , we consider the fully relativistic regime , where the terms are retained up to the second order of @xmath9 . as for the gravity ,",
    "on the other hand , we adopt the pseudo - newtonian approximation ( paczyski , wiita 1980 ) , since we do not consider the region very close to the schwarzschild radius . for simplicity , in the present paper , we assume that the gas is _ isothermal _ , because we focus our attention on the general properties of transonic disk winds driven by disk radiation fields under relativistic radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "we further assume the radiative equilibrium and use the gray approximation .",
    "finally , in order to close moment equations , we adopt the _ velocity - dependent variable eddington factor _ proposed by fukue ( 2006 ) .      under these assumptions ,",
    "the radiation hydrodynamic equations for steady vertical ( @xmath10 ) winds are described as follows ( kato et al .",
    "1998 , 2007 ; fukue 2006 ) .",
    "the continuity equation is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the proper gas density , @xmath13 the vertical four velocity , @xmath14 the mass - loss rate per unit area , and @xmath4 the speed of light .",
    "the four velocity @xmath13 is related to the proper three velocity @xmath8 by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the lorentz factor , @xmath17 .",
    "the equation of motion is , within the present approximation , @xmath18 , \\label{u1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the mass of the central object , @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath22 being the radius , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) the schwarzschild radius , @xmath25 the gas internal energy per unit proper volume , @xmath26 the gas pressure measured in the comoving frame , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the absorption and scattering opacities ( gray ) , defined in the comoving frame , @xmath29 the radiation energy density , @xmath30 the radiative flux , and @xmath31 the radiation pressure observed in the inertial frame ( fukue 2006 ; kato et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the first term in the square bracket on the right - hand side of equation ( [ u1 ] ) means the radiatively - driven force , which is modified to the order of @xmath32 , whereas the second term is the radiation drag force , which is also modified , but roughly proportional to the velocity .",
    "compared with the previous researches ( fukue 2006 ; fukue and akizuki 2006 ) , we have added the pressure gradient force , the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ u1 ] ) , and the related factor , @xmath33 to the third term .",
    "the radiative equilibrium condition is , in the inertial frame , written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the emissivity defined in the comoving frame ( fukue 2006 ; kato et al .",
    "2007 ) . for radiation fields ,",
    "the zeroth - moment equation becomes @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\      & = & -\\rho ( \\kappa_{\\rm abs}+\\kappa_{\\rm sca } ) \\frac{u}{\\gamma } \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\times     \\left [ f(1 + 2u^2)\\gamma - ( ce+cp)\\gamma^2 u \\right ] , \\label{f1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use equation ( [ j1 ] ) for the second equality .",

    "2007 ) .",
    "in order to close moment equations for radiation fields , we need some closure relation . instead of the usual eddington approximation , we here adopt a _ velocity - dependent _ variable eddington factor @xmath38 , @xmath39 in the comoving frame , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the quantities in the comoving frame , and @xmath42 .",
    "if we adopt this form ( [ close0 ] ) as the closure relation in the comoving frame , the transformed closure relation in the inertial frame is @xmath43 or equivalently , @xmath44 as a form of the function @xmath38 , we adopt the simplest one : @xmath45 for a plane - parallel geometry ( fukue 2006 ; fukue , akizuki 2006 ; cf . akizuki and fukue 2007 for a spherically symmetric geometry ) .    using continuity equation ( [ rho1 ] ) and equation of motion ( [ u1 ] ) , after some manipulations",

    "in addition to the above regularity conditions , at the wind top of @xmath73 we must impose the boundary conditions , which is different from the usual ones for a static photosphere , since the wind top moves upward at a relativistic speed ( fukue 2005 ) . in the case of a `` moving photosphere '' , due to relativistic aberration and doppler effect ( cf .",

    "in this example of supersonic winds , the wind final speed is almost the speed of light , since both the initial flux and isothermal sound speed are large .",
    "in this paper we have examined the relativistic radiation hydrodynamical winds from a luminous accretion disk in the relativistic regime of @xmath110 .",
    "the wind is assumed to be steady , vertical , and isothermal . using a velocity - dependent variable eddington factor ,",
    "the basic equations can be numerically solved without meeting the pathological singular point at @xmath111 to reach the relativistic regime .    for less luminous cases ,",
    "vertical disk winds are transonic types passing through saddle - type critical points , and the wind final speeds are 0.40.8@xmath112 for typical parameters . for luminous cases ,",
    "on the other hand , disk winds become supersonic types without passing through any critical points , and the wind final speeds becomes on the order of @xmath4 . the boundary between the transonic and supersonic types",
    "is located at around @xmath0 .    in usual standard accretion disks ,",
    "the local luminosity is sub - eddington .",
    "hence , for proton - electron normal plasmas the above condition is safficiently fulfilled , and transonic winds driven by radiation and gas pressures would blow off . for electron - positron pair plasmas , on the other hand ,",
    "the local luminosity becomes super - eddington , and pair winds would supersonically blow off .",
    "the maximum attainable velocity of the wind can be roughly estimated by the energy conservation . in the schwarzschild space - time , without any energy source except for gravity , the total energy of the radiation hydrodynamical flow along the streamline , @xmath113 where @xmath114 , is conserved .",
    "if all of the thermal energy of the gas and the radiative energy in the initial state is converted to the bulk energy of the gas , the final velocity would become its upper limit : @xmath115 if , further , the gas is at rest in the initial state and in the virial state , @xmath116\\sqrt{g_{00 } } |_{z=0 } = 1 $ ] , then we finally have the maximum attainable velocity as @xmath117 for example , in the present typical case of @xmath82 , @xmath118 , @xmath83 , we have @xmath119 , or @xmath120 .    hence , from the view point of energetics , the final velocity becomes higher and higher , as the ratio @xmath121 becomes large ; the radiative flux is so high or the mass - loss rate is so low . in other words , if the small amount of the gas gains the large amount of the radiation energy , the final bulk velocity becomes high . in general , however , it may be difficult for such a re - distribution of energy to take place , and the ratio @xmath121 would be on the order of unity .",
    "thus , we conclude that the maximum attainable velocity of accretion disk winds emanating from the disk inner region would be @xmath122 or so , as long as it consists of normal plasmas .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the current theoretical works refered in the introduction , those explain mildly relativistic jets of @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) in ss  433 to highly relativistic jets of @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) in several microquasars .    for ultra - relativistic jets of @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) supposed in several active galactic nuclei or extremely relativistic jets of @xmath129 ( @xmath130 )",
    "expected to gamma - ray bursts , it may be necessary some other processes , including an extra - ordinary re - distribution of energy , pair dominant plasmas , an energy deposition from other energy sources , such as a nuclear one via neutrino , and so on ."
