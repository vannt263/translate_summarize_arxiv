    "this is the fifth in a series of papers@xcite investigating the properties of strongly correlating liquids,@xcite i.e. , liquids that have strong correlations between their constant - volume equilibrium fluctuations of potential energy , @xmath4 , and virial@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the position of particle @xmath7 at time @xmath8 .",
    "as is well known , the average virial @xmath0 gives the configurational contribution to the pressure : @xmath9 letting @xmath10 denote instantaneous deviations from equilibrium mean values , the @xmath3 correlation is quantified by the correlation coefficient @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 denoting equilibrium average ) : @xmath13 perfect correlation gives @xmath14 . as a pragmatic definition we have chosen `` strongly correlating liquids '' to designate liquids that have @xmath15 in the @xmath2 ensemble ( constant volume , @xmath16 , and temperature , @xmath17 ) .",
    "strongly correlating liquids have simpler physics than liquids in general , an observation that has particular significance for the highly viscous phase.@xcite thus it has been shown that strongly correlating viscous liquids to a good approximation have all eight frequency - dependent thermoviscoelastic response functions@xcite given in terms of just one@xcite ( i.e. , are single - parameter liquids in the sense of having dynamic prigogine - defay ratio@xcite close to unity@xcite ) .",
    "strongly correlating viscous liquids moreover obey density scaling@xcite to a good approximation , i.e. , their dimensionless relaxation time @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the average particle mass ) depends on density @xmath20 and temperature as @xmath21.@xcite    paper i@xcite presented computer simulations of 13 different systems , showing that van der waals type liquids are strongly correlating , whereas hydrogen - bonding liquids like methanol or water are not . strongly correlating liquids include@xcite , for instance , the standard lennard - jones ( lj ) liquid , the kob - andersen binary lj ( kablj ) mixture , an asymmetric rigid - bond dumbbell model , a seven - site united - atom toluene model , and the lewis - wahnstrm otp model .",
    "paper ii@xcite analyzed the cause of @xmath3 correlations with a focus on the lj potential .",
    "the strong correlations were related to the well - known fact that an inverse power - law ( ipl ) pair potential , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the distance between two particles , @xcite implies perfect @xmath3 correlation@xcite ,    @xmath24    with @xmath25 . around the potential energy minimum , the lj potential is well described by an `` extended '' inverse power - law potential ( eipl),@xcite @xmath26 . at constant volume",
    "the linear term contributes little to the virial and potential - energy fluctuations : when one nearest - neighbor interatomic distance increases , others decrease in such a way that the sum is almost constant .",
    "thus systems interacting via the lj potential inherit strong @xmath3 correlations from an underlying inverse power - law - they have a `` hidden scale invariance''.@xcite    paper iii@xcite gave further numerical evidence for the explanation for strong @xmath3 correlations presented in paper ii , and theoretical results were given on the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of the hidden scale invariance that characterizes strongly correlating liquids .",
    "it was also shown that strong virial - potential energy correlations are present even in out - of - equilibrium situations - the hidden scale invariance is a property of the potential energy surface , not just of the equilibrium states .",
    "paper iv@xcite introduced the concept of `` isomorphs '' in the phase diagram of a strongly correlating liquid .",
    "starting from a single assumption a number of isomorph invariants were derived . in particular , structure and dynamics",
    "were shown to be invariant on isomorphs when reduced units are used .    in the present paper",
    "further simulation results supporting the isomorph predictions are presented using systems interacting with the multicomponent generalized lj potential : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an ipl potential acting between the two particles @xmath7 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 for systems interacting via a generalized lj potential , a prediction for the shape of the isomorphs in the @xmath3 phase diagram is derived in section iii and demonstrated to fit well to simulation results.@xcite interestingly , the isomorph shape depends only on the exponents @xmath19 and @xmath31 .",
    "thus , e.g. , all 12 - 6 lj systems have the same isomorphs in the @xmath3 phase diagram .",
    "finally we briefly present two applications of the theory .",
    "one tests the paper iv prediction that solid - liquid coexistence lines are isomorphs .",
    "the second application gives an approximate equation of state for systems interacting via generalized lj potentials ; this is arrived at by combining the present theory with rosenfeld and tarazona s expression for the isochoric temperature dependence of the potential energy .",
    "we term a microscopic configuration `` physically relevant '' if its influence on the thermodynamics and dynamics of the sustem is not _ a priori _ negligible ( paper iv ) .",
    "for instance , any configuration with very strong particle overlap is physically irrelevant ; note , however , that even unlikely configurations like transition states are relevant .",
    "two state points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with temperatures @xmath32 and @xmath33 and densities @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , are defined to be _ isomorphic _ ( paper iv ) if they obey the following : any two physically relevant configurations of state points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which trivially scale into one another , @xmath38 have proportional configurational boltzmann statistical weights : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the potential energy function and it is understood that the constant @xmath41 depends only on the state points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the property of being isomorphic defines a mathematical equivalence relation on the set of state points .",
    "the corresponding equivalence classes are smooth curves in the phase diagram termed isomorphs or isomorphic curves .",
    "equation ( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) implies identity of the normalized boltzmann probabilities for scaled relevant configurations of isomorphic state points .",
    "as detailed in paper iv this identity implies that several quantities are invariant along an isomorph .",
    "examples include the configurational entropy , the isochoric specific heat , n - particle distribution functions in reduced units ( in particular , the radial distribution function(s ) ) , reduced - unit dynamics ( both for newtonian and stochastic dynamics ) , normalized reduced - time autocorrelation functions , reduced - unit transport coefficients , etc .",
    "it was further shown in paper iv that a jump from an equilibrium state to an isomorphic state point brings the system instantaneously to equilibrium ( see also ref . ) .",
    "ipl potentials are euler homogeneous functions , i.e. , obey @xmath42 .",
    "such purely repulsive potentials  which do not describe real intermolecular interactions  are the only potentials that have 100% correlation between virial and potential energy fluctuations ; this reflects the well - known ipl virial - theorem identity @xmath43 .",
    "likewise , only ipl liquids have exact isomorphs ; they satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) with @xmath44 for all configurations of two state points obeying @xmath45 where @xmath25 .",
    "appendix a of paper iv showed that strongly correlating liquids generally have isomorphs to a good approximation .",
    "consequently , to a good approximation these liquids inherit a number of the exact invariants that ipl liquids have along their curves given by @xmath46 , namely all the ipl invariants that do not rely on the ipl identity @xmath44 .",
    "examples include the above mentioned thermodynamic , static , and dynamic isomorph invariants .",
    "ipl invariants that are not inherited by strongly correlating liquids in general include , e.g. , the helmholtz free energy over temperature , the potential energy over temperature , and the reduced - unit compressibility .    the fact that strongly correlating liquids have isomorphs to a good approximation should be understood as follows",
    ". any liquid has curves in its phase diagram of constant excess entropy , curves of constant isochoric specific heat , curves of constant reduced relaxation time , curves of constant reduced - unit transport coefficients , etc . for a strongly correlating liquid these curves are almost identical , and they define its ( approximate ) isomorphs .",
    "points on these isomorphs have approximately identical structure and approximately identical dynamics as probed , e.g. , by normalized reduced - time - autocorrelation functions .    for clarity of presentation below we shall not repeatedly mention that the existence of isomorphs is not exact for generalized lj systems .",
    "accordingly , we shall speak of isomorphs as a unique , well - defined concept . in other words : all properties of isomorphs derived below in generalized lj systems would be exact if these systems did have exact isomorphs , e.g. , fulfilled eq .",
    "( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) ; since this is not the case , the properties are in principle  as well as practice  approximate .",
    "the structure in reduced units ( @xmath47 ) is predicted to be invariant along an isomorph ( paper iv ) .",
    "the excess entropy , @xmath48 , depends only on structure and was shown in paper iv also to be invariant along an isomorph ( here and henceforth `` excess '' refers to the quantity in question in excess to that of an ideal gas with same density and temperature ) . in the below simulations we generate an isomorph as a set of state points in the phase diagram with constant @xmath49 . to change density and temperature keeping @xmath49 constant ,",

    "( [ scaledef ] ) have identical boltzmann probabilities according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) .",
    "consequently , the two isomorphic state points must also have the same macroscopic phase behavior .",
    "in other words , if an isomorph were to cross the coexistence line , part of the isomorph would have liquid microstates as the most likely and part of it would have mixed crystalline - liquid microstates as the most likely .",
    "this would violate the proportionality of boltzmann statistical weights for scaled states , the property that defines an isomorph .",
    "given that an isomorph can not cross the solid - liquid coexistence line , the next point is to note that ",
    "because all state points belong to some isomorph  a curve infinitesimally close to the coexistence line must be an isomorph .",
    "this argument applies in the @xmath124 phase diagram , as well as in the density - temperature or the pressure - temperature phase diagrams . in the first two cases there is a multitude of isomorphs in the coexistence region ; for instance one particular isomorph will be characterized by 53% liquid and 47% crystal , etc . in the pressure - temperature phase diagram",
    "these `` coexistence '' isomorphs collapse into one .",
    "the prediction that the melting line , both slightly to the liquid side and slightly to the solid side , are isomorphs has a number of consequences and it sheds new light on well - known phenomenological melting rules ( as well as exceptions to these rules for non - strongly correlating liquids , paper iv ) .",
    "thus , for instance the observation that the lindemann melting criterion is pressure independent for a given liquid follows from the isomorph property of the melting line ( whereas the existence of a universal lindemann criterion does not follow ) . indeed , as is easy to show from paper iv the isomorph theory implies ross `` generalized lindemann melting law '' from 1969 @xcite , according to which the reduced configurational partition function of the crystalline phase @xmath125 $ ] is invariant along the melting line ( here @xmath1 is the potential energy , @xmath126 is the potential energy of the crystal with all atoms located exactly at their lattice sites , and the tilde denotes reduced coordinates .",
    "further well - known melting rules , which the isomorph theory explains , include ( paper iv ) : the reduced viscosity , the reduced surface tension , the reduced diffusion constant , and the reduced heat conductivity are all invariant in the liquid phase along the melting line .",
    "likewise , the reduced - unit static structure factor is invariant along the melting curve .",
    "these rules have been confirmed for several liquids in both experiment and simulation ( see references of paper v ) .    like other isomorph predictions following from eq .",

    "( [ eq : isomorphdef ] ) exactly , i.e. , perfectly correlating systems .",
    "indeed , it straightforward to show that in ipl systems the phase behavior depends only on @xmath127 , and thus the co - existence line is an ( exact ) isomorph .",
    "the interesting question now is : how well do strongly correlating systems , e.g. , generalized lj systems , follow the prediction ? note that we do not expect the liquid - gas co - existence lines to be isomorphs ( and indeed they are not ) ; the gas - phase is not strongly correlating and thus eq .",
