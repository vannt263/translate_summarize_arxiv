    "since the pionnering work of gomez - ullate et al @xcite , the exceptional orthogonal polynomials ( eop ) and their connexion with rational extensions of solvable quantum potentials have been an active research subject gomez2,gomez3,gomez4,gomez5,gomez6,quesne1,quesne , quesne2,quesne3,odake , sasaki , ho , odake2,sasaki2,dutta , ho2,grandati2,grandati3,grandati4 .",
    "the eop appear to be the constitutive elements of the eigenstates of solvable rational extensions of the second category primary translationally shape - invariant potentials ( tsip ) @xcite in a series of recent papers @xcite we have developped a new approach which allows to generate infinite sets of such regular solvable extensions starting from every tsip in a very direct and systematic way without taking recourse to any ansatz or ad hoc deforming functions .",
    "this approach is based on a generalization of the usual susy partnership built from excited states .",
    "the corresponding darboux - bcklund transformations ( dbt ) , which are covariance transformations for the class of riccati - schrdinger ( rs ) equations @xcite , are based on regularized rs functions corresponding to unphysical ( negative energy ) eigenfunctions of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "they are obtained by using discrete symmetries acting on the parameters of the considered family of potentials .",
    "if the use of negative energy states has been already proposed in early years of susy mq development @xcite , such a systematic scheme has never been envisaged . in the case of the isotonic oscillator , this gives the three infinite sets @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of regular rationally solvable extensions of this potential , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 series potentials being strictly isospectral to the isotonic one and inherits of its shape - invariance property .",
    "very recently gomez - ullate , kamran and milson @xcite introduce a new family of eop built from the classical laguerre polynomials via two step darboux transformations . in the present article",
    "we show that the scheme developed in grandati2,grandati3,grandati4 admits a very natural n - step extension which allows to recover and generalize the result of @xcite .",
    "we obtain new infinite towers of rational extensions of the isotonic potential strictly isospectral to this last .",
    "their eigenfunctions are associated to the new eop families , the one introduced by gomez - ullate et al corresponding to the @xmath3 particular case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we recall the basic elements of the method in its one step form and the results obtained for the isotonic system .",
    "the regularity of the rs functions is here obtained in a self consistent way , using disconjugacy properties of the schrdinger equation @xcite without recourse of the kienast - lawton - hahn theorem @xcite .",
    "then we present on a formal level the general @xmath4step scheme and in the specific case of the isotonic oscillator , we give a criterion of concrete application in terms of asymptotic behaviour near the origin .",
    "next we consider in a detailed manner the particular @xmath5 case , initially envisaged by gomez - ullate et al gomez7 .",
    "we then prove by induction a sufficient condition to be able to build a @xmath4step chain of regular and strictly isospectral extended potentials .",
    "we finally show that the shape invariance properties of the isotonic potential are hereditary and reached by all these extended potentials .    during the writing of this article , two papers on the same subject appeared .",
    "the first one @xcite contains results parallels to those developed here .",
    "the authors adopt a point of view similar to the one initiated in grandati2,grandati3,grandati4 and extended in the present paper .",
    "the so - called `` virtual states deletion method '' corresponding exactly to the use of dbt based on unphysical eigenfunctions associated to regularized rs functions .",
    "the second one @xcite discusses quite extensively the 2 and 3 steps cases under a slightly different angle and proposes an interesting conjecture on possible `` degeneracies '' in the set of the new generated elp .",
    "the content of the present article has been established independently of these two works .",
    "if @xmath6 is an eigenstate of @xmath7 associated to the eigenvalue @xmath8 ( @xmath9 )    @xmath10    then the riccati - schrdinger ( rs ) function @xmath11 satisfies the corresponding riccati - schrdinger ( rs ) equation @xcite    @xmath12    it is a well - known fact that the set of general riccati equations is invariant under the group @xmath13 of smooth @xmath14-valued curves @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the particular subclass of riccati - schrdinger equations is , as for it , preserved by a specific subset of @xmath13 .",
    "these transformations , called darboux - bcklund transformations ( dbt ) , are built from any solution @xmath16 of the initial rs equation eq([edr4 ] ) as carinena2,ramos , grandati    @xmath17    where @xmath18 .",

    "we can however envisage to use any other regular solution of eq([edr4 ] ) as long as it has no zero on the considered real interval @xmath42 , even if it does not correspond to a physical state .",
    "for some systems , it is possible to obtain such solutions by using specific discrete symmetries @xmath43 which are covariance transformations for the considered family of potentials    @xmath44    @xmath43 acts on the parameters of the potential and transforms the rs function of a  physical excited eigenstate @xmath45 into a unphysical rs function @xmath46 associated to the negative eigenvalue @xmath47 .",

    "if the transformed rs function @xmath52 of eq([eqrspourv ] ) is regular on @xmath42 , it can be used to build a regular extended potential ( see eq([pottrans ] ) and eq([fodbt ] ) )    @xmath53    ( quasi)isospectral to @xmath54 .",

    "the above construction can be summarized by the following diagram    @xmath64    with    @xmath65    this procedure can be viewed as a `` generalized susy  qm  partnership '' where the dbt can be based on excited states rs  functions properly regularized by the symmetry @xmath66 .",
    "to control the regularity of @xmath49 we can make use of the disconjugacy properties of the schrdinger equation for negative eigenvalues .    a second order differential equation like eq([eds ] ) is said to be disconjugated on @xmath67 ( @xmath54 is supposed to be continuous on @xmath42 ) if every solution of this equation has at most one zero on @xmath42 @xcite . as it is well known , this zero is necessarily simple and at this value the considered solution changes its sign . for a closed or open interval @xmath42 , the disconjugacy of eq([eds ] )",
