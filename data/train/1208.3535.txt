    "recently , reeves & golub ( 2011 ) reported three events which show hot plasma above the flare arcade observed by aia / sdo .",
    "aia provides multi - wavelength euv images with 1.2 @xmath3 resolution and 12 s temporal cadence .",
    "we have examined one of these events , which shows significant microwave emission in the supra - arcade structure , using norh , rhessi , and aia / sdo .",
    "we have examined the supra - arcade structure associated with an m1.6 flare which occurred on the 4th of november 2010 , on the south - west limb .",
    "the goes x - ray flux shows that the flare starts at 23:52 , peaks at 23:57 , and gradually decreases before the start of another flare at 00:50 on the 5th of november .",
    "the flare arcade shows emission at all euv wavelengths , while the supra - arcade structure in the high corona is particularly prominent at aia 131   ( fig .",
    "comparisons with other wavelengths suggest t = 11  mk for the supra - arcade structure .",
    "the supra - arcade structure is present in 131   from the flare onset until the onset of the subsequent flare on the 5th .",
    "the hinode x - ray telescope ( xrt ) also observed this hot plasma .",
    "the @xmath0 of the hot plasma in high corona at 17 ghz slowly increases and extends out to the region of hot 131   supra - arcade ( blue contours in fig .",
    "1 ) . red contours in fig .",
    "1 show rhessi 8 - 20 kev soft x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray images were made using the 2-step clean method ( krucker et al .",
    "two different sources we identified : a bright compact source above the post - flare arcade ; and a faint , extended source cospatial with the supra - arcade structure . both sources appear continuously throughout the decay phase .",
    "following dulk ( 1985 ) , for an optically thin , isothermal plasma , the brightness temperature at a given frequency is related to the plasma temperature @xmath4 ( 11 mk for our event ) by @xmath5 , where the optical depth @xmath6 . using this we determine an emission measure @xmath7 of 2@xmath110@xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the electron number density and thermal energy were found to increase up to 5@xmath110@xmath10 @xmath11 and 1@xmath110@xmath12 erg , respectively .",
    "the supra - arcade thermal structure of an m1.6 flare is observed in microwaves , euv and soft x - rays .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 of the supra - arcade at 17 ghz increases as the flare decays .",
    "a thermal x - ray source is also present in the supra - arcade .",
    "the results show unexpectedly high , and increasing , values of density and thermal energy in supra - arcade flare plasma , persisting throughout a long decay phase of around 50 min .",
    "to study the physical mechanism for heating and injection of this plasma into the supra - arcade structure , further work using aia filter ratio temperature estimation method and a more detailed investigation of the morphological evolution of the hot plasma will be carried out .",
    "time series images taken by aia 131   with contours of norh 17 ghz ( thick blue line ) and rhessi 8 - 20 kev ( thin red line ) for the decay phase of the flare .",
    "the levels of contour of norh 17 ghz are 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 @xmath1 10@xmath2 @xmath0 .",
    "the levels of contour of rhessi are given in percentage of peak intensity ( @xmath13 ) : for bright source above loop - top , 70 , 80 , 90 % and for faint source on supra - arcade structure , 3.3 , 3.4 , 3.5 % ( left ) and 24 , 25 , 26 % ( middle ) , and 27 , 28 , 29 % ( right ) , respectively.,width=472 ]",

    "<S> we have investigated a supra - arcade structure , associated with an m1.6 flare , which occurred on the south - east limb on 4th of november 2010 . it is observed in microwaves at 17 ghz with the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) , soft x - rays in the range of 8 - 20 kev with the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) , and euv with the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) onboard the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) . as reported by reeves & golub ( 2011 ) , the supra - arcade structure </S>",
    "<S> is observed predominantly in the aia 131   channel , which contains a hot 11 mk component from fe xix ( boerner et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2011 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while this hot flare plasma lasts over the decay phase of the flare , it shows some interesting characteristics in microwaves and soft x - rays : 1 ) in the supra - arcade structure , the brightness temperature ( @xmath0 ) of the microwave emission increases gradually up to 2@xmath110@xmath2 k , and 2 ) two soft x - ray sources appear : one cospatial with the supra - arcade structure and another above the post - flare arcade . </S>",
    "<S> we have derived the variation of emission measure , density , and energy of the supra - arcade structure using the @xmath0 obtained from 17 ghz microwave observations . </S>"
