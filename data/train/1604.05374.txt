    "a long - standing goal of the solar interior physics is to reproduce active regions , composed mainly of the sunspots , self - consistently from magnetic fluxes generated in the solar interior .",
    "we now approach the subject from two different theoretical perspectives : one focuses on emergence and organization processes of the magnetic flux in the uppermost part of the convection zone ( cz ) , and the other explores the flux generation and maintenance processes , i.e. , the dynamo process , operating deeper down .",
    "several leading - edge numerical studies , which focus on the uppermost part of the solar cz , have succeeded to simulate spontaneous formations of concentrated magnetic structures reminiscent of active regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these studies , the solar surface convection and its nonlinear interaction with the magnetic field",
    "were simulated in a more or less realistic manner with the steep density gradient just below the photosphere and/or the radiative transfer with the ionization in cartesian domains .",
    "however , since some sort of the large - scale seed magnetic field has been assumed inconsistently as initial or boundary condition , the dynamo mechanism and its connection to the formation process of the active region were beyond the scope of these studies .    a growing body of evidence is accumulating to demonstrate that solar - like cyclic large - scale magnetic field is organized in global spherical - shell convections ( e.g. , * ?",

    "despite some differences in the numerical setup and method , there is a common outcome of the convective dynamo in these studies : diffuse magnetic flux extending over the cz and/or the tachocline instead of magnetic flux tubes expected in the standard solar dynamo paradigm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "although the flux emergence like event from distributed magnetic flux has been occasionally observed in some models @xcite , its universality or feasibility in the sun is still a matter of considerable debate .",
    "there is still a large gap between the dynamo in the interior and the active region formation at the surface .",

    "since the mean kinetic helicity , which is a prerequisite for exciting the large - scale dynamo , arises as a natural consequence of the rotation , the dynamo - generated magnetic field also affects the convective motion shown in figure 1c .",

    "the large - scale dynamo observed here in the strongly - stratified model has physical properties similar to those in the weakly - stratified convective dynamo simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ms14a ) .",

    "our intriguing finding in this letter , which have not been observed in the weakly - stratified model with the similar boundary conditions , is spontaneous formation of large - scale magnetic structures in the cz surface , which will be reported in the following .          a series of snapshots where the distribution of the @xmath75 at different time on the horizontal cutting plane at @xmath76 is shown in the top panel of figure 3a .",

    "the surface magnetic structure has the dynamically - important strength comparable to @xmath52 and is recurrently - appeared in the dynamo - saturated stage [ ( a5 ) ] , implying that it should be a consequence of the strongly - stratified mhd convection rather than a transiently - formed structure .",
    "the one - sided horizontal average ( @xmath3- or @xmath4-average ) of the @xmath75 may be helpful to clearly demonstrate its depth - dependence because the horizontal average of it , i.e. , @xmath77 , is zero in our setup .",

    "the initial small - scale vertical magnetic structure gradually evolves to the larger scale in the upper cz .",
    "while it prevails in the mid - part of the cz in the dynamo - saturated stage , the core of the large - scale @xmath75 structure stays in around the cz surface .",
    "figure 3b shows the temporal evolution of two - dimensional ( 2d ) fourier spectrum of the @xmath80 in the upper cz . here the spectrum at each depth is projected onto a one - dimensional wavenumber @xmath81 and then is averaged over the normalized depth from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "the energy - containing scale of the @xmath75 becomes larger with the time and finally reaches the possible largest scale in the upper cz , confirming the existence of the large - scale @xmath75 structure in the upper cz .",
    "since the large - scale vertical magnetic component can not be generated solely by the @xmath0-type dynamo only with the vertical helicity variation ( see , ms14b ) , some additional mechanism should play a role in organizing it in this simulation .",
    "the so - called negative magnetic pressure instability ( nempi ) has been proposed as a mechanism for the self - assembly of the magnetic flux near the cz surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the vertical and horizontal axes are normalized by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "note that the instability is inhibited in the range @xmath97 due to the box - width constraint .",
    "the dynamo - maintained magnetic flux is unstable to the parker instability in the span @xmath98 .",
    "since the typical growth time of it is comparable to or a bit smaller than @xmath99 , it has a sufficient time to grow during the simulation .",
    "however , the most unstable mode has a smaller wavelength in comparison with the box - width , implying the difficulty to explain the dominance of the box - sized surface magnetic structure in our simulation .",
    "additionally to the mismatch of the magnetic spatial - scales , the growth of the parker instability itself may be inhibited by vigorous convective motions . in figure 4b , the growth time of the most unstable mode of the parker instability ( solid : @xmath100 ) and the local convective turn - over time defined by @xmath101 ( dashed ) are compared as a function of the depth , where @xmath102 . in the upper cz ,",
    "the condition @xmath103 is always satisfied . since , in such a situation , the small - scale convective motion violently disturbs the coherency of the magnetic flux , we would have to say that the parker instability would not be responsible for the large - scale structure formation observed in our simulation .",
    "next , the large - scale flow and its association with the surface magnetic structure are analyzed .",
    "for casting light on the large - scale pattern , the small - scale structures with @xmath104 are eliminated by applying fourier filtering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a series of snapshots where @xmath105 and @xmath106 on the horizontal plane at @xmath76 are shown in figure 5a , where @xmath107 denotes fourier filtering .",
    "the over - plotted arrows are the velocity vectors composed of @xmath108 and @xmath109 . additionally , 2d spectra of @xmath110 , @xmath80 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the upper cz are also shown in figure 5b .",
    "the spectrum at each depth is spatially - averaged over the normalized depth from @xmath82 to @xmath83 and is temporally - averaged over @xmath113 around the corresponding reference time .",
    "it is prominent that , in the dynamo - saturated stage , the bipolar  band - like \" structure elongated along the direction of the horizontal magnetic flux is predominant ( see fig.2b ) .",
    "although the faster horizontal flow and stronger downflow can be found in / around the region with the stronger @xmath75 before the dynamo - saturation ( left column ) , large - scale flow pattern is not necessarily associated with the magnetic structure in the dynamo - saturated stage ( middle and right columns ) .",
    "in addition , we can find from the spectra that the energy contained in the large - scale magnetic components is much larger than that of the large - scale flow in the upper cz .",
    "this would suggest that the large - scale flows are not the cause , but a consequence of the large - scale magnetic structures in the upper cz .",
    "overall our analyses indicate that there should be an as - yet - unknown mechanism for the self - organization of large - scale magnetic structures , which would be inherent in the strongly - stratified atmosphere .",
    "the band - like magnetic structure observed in our simulation is similar to that observed in the large - scale dynamo by the forced turbulence in a strongly - stratified atmosphere @xcite .",
    "this may imply that the surface magnetic structure formation is a common universal feature of the strongly - stratified mhd turbulence regardless of its details .",
    "in this letter , we studied numerically mhd convections in the strongly - stratified atmosphere resembling the solar interior .",
    "the large - scale dynamo observed in our simulation had physical properties similar to those observed in the weakly - stratified model ( see ms14ab ) : the oscillatory large - scale horizontal magnetic component with the dynamically - important strength was spontaneously organized in the bulk of the cz .",
    "its spatio - temporal evolution strongly suggests that the @xmath0-type mechanism would be responsible for the mhd dynamo in our system .",
    "our intriguing finding , which have not been observed in the weakly - stratified model , was the spontaneous formation of the large - scale @xmath75 structure in the cz surface .",
    "small - scale tangled components of the @xmath75 which was seen in the earlier evolutionary stage gradually evolved to the large - scale organized structure with the size much larger than convective cell as time passes in the upper cz . in the dynamo - saturated stage ,",
    "the bipolar  band - like \" @xmath75 structure was predominant and was recurrently - appeared .",
    "since the possible candidates , such as the nempi , parker instability , and flux expulsion due to the strong downflow , had difficulties to explain the surface magnetic structure formation , our results may suggest the existence of an as - yet - unrecognized mechanism inducing the spontaneous formation of the large - scale magnetic structure in the strongly - stratified convective atmosphere .",
    "the large - scale dynamo observed here maintains the quasi - steady magnetic flux and thus is different from the actual solar dynamo with a quasi - periodic flux modulation .",
    "furthermore , since we adopt the faster rotation than that achieved in the actual sun and ignore the global effects , such as differential rotation and meridional flows , our model still remains a long way from the solar interior .",
    "however , despite a lack of some solar elements , it would be interesting that the relatively shallow root of the surface magnetic structure , implied from our simulation , seems to be compatible with some observations of the magnetic patches on the solar surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the self - organization mechanism of the surface magnetic structure observed in our study should deepen our knowledge of the solar magnetism and is a priority target of our future work .",
