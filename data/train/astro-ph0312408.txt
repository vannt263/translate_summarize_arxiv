    "studies of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) have largely focused on wavelengths @xmath1 1  where accretion processes dominate the system emission .",
    "surprisingly little is known about the ir properties of cvs @xcite .",
    "near - ir observations show contributions above that of the k / m donor star spectrum which peaks around @xmath2 m . in most cases colors are bluer than expected because of residual light from the accretion disc . in others the colors are redder , which is interpreted as the emission from the evolved secondary components or from the cool outer regions of unusually large accretion discs @xcite .",
    "in well - known systems , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) can be decomposed into its different components ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite then argued that u  gem and ss  cyg have excess near - ir emission above that expected from the secondary star .",
    "a possible source of additional ir emission is cold material located outside the binary system .",
    "some cvs have p  cyg lines formed in an accretion disc wind ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 , @xmath5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath4 ) ; rapidly spinning white dwarf magnetic fields can propel large fractions of the gas out of the system ( _ e.g. , _  ae  aqr ) ; and runaway nuclear burning in novae leads to the ejection of the white dwarf envelope ( @xmath7  m@xmath6 ) . a small fraction of this ejected material may remain bound to the binary and form a _ circumbinary disc _ ( cb disc ) .",
    "another possible source of material is residual gas from the common - envelope evolution phase which precedes the onset of mass transfer .",
    "the inner edge of a cb disc is tidally coupled to the binary system , leading to the extraction of angular momentum from the orbital motion @xcite .",
    "the cb disc therefore expands as angular momentum is redistributed by viscous interactions @xcite resulting in a very efficient orbital braking mechanism if the cb disc is sufficiently dense @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out by @xcite that the angular momentum loss associated with magnetic braking based on the @xcite law severely underestimates the rotational velocities of single stars in open clusters , implying that the magnetic braking that has been the basis for cv evolution ( _ e.g. , _   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is significantly reduced ( _ c.f . , _   * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hence , additional angular momentum losses are required to understand the diversity and level of the mass transfer rates in cvs .",
    "cb discs can provide this angular momentum loss ( in addition to gravitational wave radiation and magnetic braking ) that may help to solve some of the puzzles of cv evolution , such as the lack of a peak at the minimum in the orbital period distribution , the order of magnitude spread in mass transfer rates @xmath8 at a given @xmath9 or the very high @xmath8 implied by steady nuclear burning on the white dwarf in the supersoft sources ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "as mass in the cb disc builds up , a feedback effect increases @xmath10 above the values expected from standard evolution eventually leading to the dissolution of the binary @xcite . at this point ,",
    "cb discs will typically be optically thick with sizes @xmath111 - 10  au and effective temperatures of a few 1000  k in their innermost regions .",
    "these properties make them very similar to protostellar discs .",
    "observations of stationnary , faint lines with narrow velocity widths in several objects suggest the presence of circumbinary material ( z  cam , @xcite ; ip  peg , @xcite ; am  cvn , @xcite ; ss  cyg , @xcite ; qr and , @xcite ; by  cam , @xcite ) .",
    "the continuum emission from a cb disc ( possibly responsible for the narrow lines ) could easily have escaped detection up until now .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) calculated by @xcite and @xcite show that massive cb discs start dominating over the binary emission at about 5@xmath12 m in mid - ir .",
    "the mid- and far - ir remain unexplored , with _ iras _ providing loose upper limits or detections subject to source confusion ( see below ) .    motivated by the prospect of finding excess emission from a cb disc in the poorly known mid - ir regime , we observed a total of eight systems ( tab .",
    "[ tab : obj ] ) .",
    "a sed spanning the visible and mid - ir is crucial to identify the upturn caused by the cb disc , and we observed these systems nearly simultaneously with the palomar 60-inch ( visible ) and keck i telescopes ( near- and mid - ir ) .",
    "our prime objective was ss  cyg because of its brightness , parallax distance and hint of excess ir emission @xcite .",
    "the sed of cvs involves various , poorly constrained components ( accretion emission , white dwarf , secondary etc ) .",
    "their contribution is _ a priori _ expected to decrease at mid - ir wavelengths , making any excess more straightforward to identify than at visible or near - ir wavelengths .",
    "however , we caution that since very little is known about the mid - ir emission of cvs , any excess will not necessarily imply circumbinary material .",
    "the other targets are well - studied systems representing a wide range of cv sub - classes as we have little _ a priori _ knowledge of which types of cvs are more likely to have more circumbinary material .",
    "the list includes binaries with @xmath9 below the period gap , driven by gravitational wave radiation , and some with @xmath13  hrs presumably driven by magnetic wind braking .",
    "we included the supersoft qr  and despite its faintness and large distance to test the possibility that a large cb disc drives the high mass transfer rate .",
    "some of the cvs had previously published mid - ir measurements .",
    "the earliest mid - ir measurements of cvs are those of @xcite who reported ground - based 2@xmath14 upper limits at 10  of @xmath1527  mjy for ss  cyg and @xmath1536  mjy for ae  aqr .",
    "the more recent _ iso _ measurements of ae  aqr by @xcite are discussed in  [ sync ] .",
    "all other published measurements are based on _",
    "iras_. @xcite report detecting ss  cyg as it underwent a dwarf novae outburst .",
    "the fluxes at 12 and 25  are @xmath1655 and 30  mjy ( the quiescent levels are @xmath1510 and @xmath158  mjy ) . but a later study using the same data @xcite quotes a 3@xmath14 upper limit of @xmath1530  mjy at 12  and a 150@xmath1740  mjy detection at 25  for ss  cyg ( @xmath15110  mjy at 60  ) . @xcite also report 3@xmath14 upper limits for rx  and of @xmath1530  mjy at 12 and 25  .",
    "source confusion , particularly in the galactic plane , is a major issue with _ iras _ , which could explain some of the discrepancies 2  away . ] and very high far - ir fluxes @xcite . at 12",
    "the angular resolution is only @xmath1630 .",
    "there is much that remains to be clarified as regards the mid - ir emission from cvs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our palomar and keck observational setup and the data reduction . the visible to near - ir seds of the systems are shown in  3 where we fit the expected secondary star seds to the observations and investigate any anomalous excess .",
    "only two systems are detected at mid - ir wavelengths : ae  aqr and ss  cyg .",
    "the measurements and consequences on models are set out in  4 ( ae  aqr ) and  5 ( ss  cyg ) . in  6 ( which may be skipped by the observationally minded reader )",
    "we return to our original motivation for this project and explore the implications of our mid - ir upper limits on the presence and observational prospects for detecting cb discs .",

    "may overestimate its effect if most of the cb disc is shadowed and is not exposed to the light emanating from the binary system ( secondary or other sources ) .",
    "provided that the shadowed region is cold enough that its intrinsic emission has a minor impact in the ir , the overall effect would be identical to having a very small @xmath27 .",
    "the maximum allowable @xmath22 is insensitive to @xmath27 except when the disc becomes small , and the small area allows high temperatures while keeping the fluxes low .",
    "the pressure scale height variation in cb disc models does suggest that the outer disc is shadowed @xcite .",
    "detailed radiative transfer calculations are needed to verify that the inner edge of the cb disc can indeed shadow the rest of the material .",
    "an alternative to shadowing would be a dust - free disc . as discussed in  6.1 ,",
    "it is unclear whether dust in cb discs can form in situ .",
    "since the absorption is essentially due to grains , the efficiency with which radiation is reprocessed ( or , equivalently , the inner radius @xmath33 of the optically thick region ) would change if the inner cb disc was dust - free .",
    "the situation would be comparable to the circumstellar discs of herbig ae / be stars where the large radiation vaporizes the dust at small radii .",
    "an optically thin layer of grains can be vaporized up to @xmath34  cm for an average irradiating luminosity of @xmath35  erg  s@xmath4 ( see  [ thin ] ) .",
    "if there is no reprocessing up to this radius then agreement between @xmath22 and @xmath21 at the optically thick disc inner edge is easier to achieve .",
    "a larger @xmath18 requires a lower temperature to fit the ir but the upper limits are looser as the peak thermal emission moves to the far - ir , leaving more room for adjustment between the ( optically thick ) lower limit @xmath21 and upper limit @xmath22 .",
    "we summarize our results before addressing the prospect for finding cb discs .",
    "1 .   distributions for circumbinary material other than a thin disc lead to high extinctions or negligible mass .",
    "the observations limit the maximum @xmath36 in an optically thick circumbinary disc .",
    "the maximum temperature is approximately consistent with the minimum expectations from passive reprocessing of the binary emission . in ss",
    "cyg and rx  and the temperature distribution must be steep , implying small cb discs .",
    "this will generalise to other systems if we underestimated reprocessing .",
    "4 .   a small ir luminosity from the cb disc may result from a small or shadowed disc or one in which its inner regions are vaporized .",
    "the contribution from any sizeable cb disc will be significantly affected if it is either shadowed or has little dust in the ir - emitting inner region .",
    "in these cases most of the matter will be cold or optically thin , resulting in a shift of the peak emission to longer wavelengths .",
    "observations in far - ir or sub - mm wavelengths would then be more appropriate .",
    "narrow lines centered at the systemic velocity in high inclination systems may prove a different , more amenable test of circumbinary discs than their continuum emission (  1 ) .",
    "for example , @xcite reported h@xmath37 narrow absorption lines in the _ fuse _ uv spectrum of the polar by  cam that are intrinsic rather than interstellar .",
    "this is particularly important since molecular hydrogen is a clear signature of cold , dusty material .",
    "the total column density of h@xmath37 in by  cam is high : @xmath38  @xmath39 . @xcite also report h@xmath37 absorption in their _ fuse _ spectrum of qr  and with @xmath40  @xmath39 .",
    "however , it is not clear that the absorption is intrinsic in this system .",
    "the more accessible h@xmath37 1 - 0 s(1 ) lines at 2.122  could be more fruitful than space - based uv in a systematic search for molecular hydrogen in other cvs .",
    "the molecular hydrogen column density can be used to estimate ( for instance ) the @xmath41co j=1 - 0 line at 110.2  ghz in a reverse fashion from what is usually done to interpret sub - mm observations of circumstellar discs ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the expected integrated line flux is : @xmath42}{\\theta_{\\rm s}^2 } \\frac{e^{-5.29/t_{\\rm x}}}{t_{\\rm x}+0.88}\\frac{1-e^{\\tau}}{\\tau }   ~{\\rm mjy~km~s}^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is measured in units of 10@xmath44  @xmath39 , @xmath45 $ ] is the abundance of co compared to h@xmath37 ( taken to be 10@xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the excitation temperature of co , @xmath48 its optical depth and @xmath49 is the angular size of the emitting source . taking @xmath49=1 @xmath47=30  k and @xmath50 to estimate the line flux , @xmath41co emission could be detected in by  cam ( @xmath1615  mjy  km  s@xmath4 ) with present instrumentation .",
    "a search for mid - ir excess emission in several cataclysmic variables has been undertaken , motivated by the possibility that some of them may contain large circumbinary discs influencing their evolution .",
    "simultaneous visible to mid - ir photometry were obtained from which we constructed spectral energy distributions .",
    "we find that the near - ir seds of the observed cvs are reproduced by a stellar sed with the spectral type expected from the secondary .",
    "given the uncertainties on distance and that secondaries in cvs may be more luminous than their isolated main - sequence counterparts , we conclude that there is no need for extra components in the near - ir . in rw",
    "tri , a 10,000  k blackbody is needed in addition to the m0 secondary to explain the large visible flux . in wz",
    "sge , the sed can be reproduced by a power law ( accretion or hot spot ) + a cool blackbody for the faint , low - mass secondary . in qr  and ,",
    "the sed is decomposed into a rayleigh - jeans tail from the hot white dwarf and a blackbody of temperature 6,000  k and radius 3  r@xmath6 .",
    "this component is consistent with a late - f subgiant and we propose this is the hitherto undetected companion in this supersoft system .",
    "we detect ae  aqr and ss  cyg in the mid - ir at levels significantly above the extrapolation from the near - ir measurements . in both sources",
    "the mid - ir flux is variable on short timescales which may prove difficult to reconcile with intrinsic or reprocessed emission from circumbinary material .",
    "the ir detection of ae  aqr fits in very well within the overall picture of a propeller ejecting clouds of relativistic electrons .",
    "the synchrotron emission is first seen in ir before the electrons cool and emit in the radio regime .",
    "the mid - ir detection of ss  cyg is exciting and puzzling",
    ". the base - line flux may be due to a free - free wind . the ir emitting region is close to the wind launching region , explaining the variability .",
    "coherent emission from magnetic flares is another possibility .",

    "sirtf _ of these two objects could provide key insights into the processes at work .",
    "the non - detections at 4.8 and 11.7  limit the possibilities for circumbinary material .",
    "we find that any significant amount of circumbinary material must lay within a small opening angle to avoid significant visual extinction or a large ir flux . for cb discs to be important in the evolution of cvs the discs should be large and massive and characterized by temperatures @xmath51 1000  k in their inner regions .",
    "recent calculations reveal that the evolution of cb discs to this phase where they would be detectable @xcite is longer than previously estimated .",
    "the existence of less massive and less evolved cb discs is a possibility left open by our data .",
    "reprocessing of the binary emission would make evolved cb discs stand out in the mid ir unless the inner regions of the cb disc are not efficient reprocessors ( because dust is destroyed and/or can not form ) or if the cb disc is self - shadowed by its inner edge . in both cases the output from the cb disc is displaced to the far - ir .",
