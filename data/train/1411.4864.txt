    "star clusters are formed in various regions of a galaxy and they have the tendency to gradually lose mass , mainly due to dynamical interactions , until they completely dissolved . a considerable proportion of stars that are born in stellar clusters become part of the disk and halo populations of the milky way as the clusters dissolve over time .",
    "the dissolution process of star clusters is a rather old field of stellar dynamics which however , still remains very active and challenging .",
    "theoretical aspects on this intricate subject like the evaporation process about the movement of stars above the escape velocity and the time - scale of relaxation which determines the rate of the dynamical evolution of a star cluster were the first that studied analytically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) shed some new light on the procedure of how stars are actually born and form stellar clusters .",
    "open stellar clusters are formed by gravitationally bounded stars however , all clusters dissolve over time because of two main reasons : ( i ) the two - body process that dynamically affects all stars of a cluster causing them to obtain escape velocities and ( ii ) the strong tidal forces due to the external potential of the parent galaxy in which clusters are embedded .",
    "in particular , the tidal field of the parent galaxy can significantly influence the dynamical behaviour of the cluster itself @xcite .",
    "stars escape from tidally limited star clusters following a two stages process . during first stage",
    ", stars are being scattered into the escaping phase space by two - body encounters , while at second stage they escape through the channels in the open equipotential surface .",
    "the time required for a star to complete the first stage strongly depends on the relaxation time , while on the other hand , the time needed for a star to complete stage two is mainly related with the energy of the star .",

    "the chaotic dynamics of a star cluster embedded in the tidal field of a parent galaxy was investigated in @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) . conducting a thorough scanning of the available phase space the authors managed to obtain the basins of escape and the respective escape rates of the orbits , revealing that the higher escape times correspond to initial conditions of orbits near the fractal basin boundaries . in the present work we use the analysis of the 2d system presented in paper i as a starting point and",
    "we expand our exploration into three dimensions in an attempt to reveal the escape mechanism of three - dimensional orbits in a tidally limited star cluster .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in section [ mod ] we present in detail the structure and the properties of the tidal approximation model .",
    "all the computational methods we used in order to determine the character of orbits are described in section [ cometh ] . in the following section , we conduct a thorough numerical investigation revealing the bounded and escaping regions of the cluster and how they are affected by the total orbital energy ( jacobi integral ) , as well as by the initial value of the @xmath0-coordinate of the three - dimensional orbits . in section [ tc ]",
    "we try to theoretically explain and justify the observed phenomenon of trapped chaos .",
    "our paper ends with section [ disc ] , where the discussion and the conclusions of this research are given .",
    "according to the  tidal approximation \" theory , we assume that the star cluster moves on a circular orbit around the galactic center at constant angular velocity @xmath4 .",
    "this assumption allows us to apply the epicyclic approximation in order to compute linear tidal forces acting on all stars of the star cluster . in this case ,",
    "the most appropriate system of coordinates is a rotating , accelerated reference frame @xcite in which both the galactic center and the star cluster are at rest , while the origin of the coordinates is at the center of the star cluster which is located at the minimum of the effective potential of the galaxy , so that the position of the galactic center is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the radius of the circular orbit . if the star cluster follows a more general orbit ( i.e. , elliptical ) around its parent galaxy , then no integral of motion comparable to the jacobi integral is known and consequently all the numerical calculations become more difficult to be performed .    for the description of the properties of the spherically symmetric star cluster , we use the simple , analytical and self - consistent plummer potential @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , while @xmath9 is the total mass of the star cluster .",
    "the corresponding plummer radius is @xmath10 ( for more details about the isolated plummer potential see the appendix a in paper i ) .",
    "the plummer radius was chosen in such a way that model ( [ potcl ] ) to be the best fit to a @xmath11 king model , which fills completely the roche lobe in the tidal field .",

    "we observe that both centrifugal and coriolis forces appear in the above equations of motion due to the fact that the coordinate system is rotating .",

    "the escaping orbits leak out through the exit channels 1 and 2 of the equipotential surface passing either @xmath16 or @xmath17 lagrangian points , respectively . ]",
    "furthermore , the equations of motion admit the isolating integral of motion @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the momenta per unit mass , conjugate to @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath0 , respectively , while @xmath28 is the numerical value of the jacobian integral , which is conserved . the numerical value of the effective potential at the two lagrangian points @xmath29 and @xmath30 yields to a critical jacobi constant @xmath31 , which can be used to define a dimensionless energy parameter as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is some other value of the jacobian .",
    "the dimensionless energy parameter @xmath34 makes the reference to energy levels more convenient . for @xmath35",
    "the equipotential surface encloses the critical volume , while for a jacobian value @xmath36 , or in other words @xmath37 , the equipotential surface is open and consequently stars can escape from the cluster . in fig .",
    "[ surf3d ] we present a plot of the three - dimensional equipotential surface @xmath38 when @xmath21 .",
    "we observe , the two openings ( exit channels or throats ) through which the particles can leak out .",
    "in fact , we may say that these two exits act as hoses connecting the interior of the cluster with the  outside world \" .",
    "exit channel 1 ( negative @xmath26-direction ) indicates escape towards the galactic center , while channel 2 ( positive @xmath26-direction ) indicates escape towards infinity .",
    "the extent of the equipotential surface in the positive @xmath0 direction is roughly 0.5 pc , while it is 1 pc in the positive @xmath26 direction and @xmath39 pc in the positive @xmath27 direction .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ isop](a - c ) shows the projections of the equipotential surface @xmath38 on the three primary planes @xmath1 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we use the dimensionless system of units introduced in paper i according to which @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , the unit of length is one tidal radius @xmath45 pc , while the time unit is equal to 1 myr . in physical units we have @xmath46 pc@xmath47/m@xmath48/myr@xmath49 therefore , we may set the mass of the cluster and the tidal radius to realistic values to obtain the scaling factors for mass and length .",
    "in particular , to pin down a specific model , we could assume the galactocentric distance and a model for the potential of the galaxy , which will allow us to find the value of @xmath4 .",
    "if also we assume the mass of the cluster , then this immediately gives us the conversion of mass units .",
    "the characteristic frequencies @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 on the other hand , are related to the galactic gravitational potential and in the solar neighborhood can be expressed as functions of the oort s constants ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as follows @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the local value of the galactic density @xcite .",
    "exploiting the numerical values of the oort s constants provided in @xcite , we obtain the dimensionless quantities @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in order to study the escape mechanism of the orbits of the star cluster , we need to define samples of initial conditions of orbits whose properties ( bounding or escaping motion ) will be identified . the best method for this purpose , would have been to choose the sets of initial conditions of the orbits from a distribution function of the system .",
    "this however , is not available , so we define for each value of the energy ( all tested energy levels are above the escape energy ) , dense uniform grids of initial conditions regularly distributed in the area allowed by the value of the energy . in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems , however , the phase space is six - dimensional and thus the behavior of the orbits can not be easily visualized .",
    "one way to overcome this issue is to work in phase spaces with lower dimensions .",
    "let us start with initial conditions on a 4d grid following the approach used successfully in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this way , we are able to identify regions of regularity / chaos and bound / escape , which may be visualized , if we restrict our investigation to a subspace of the whole 6d phase space . as in paper",
    "i , our investigation takes place both in the physical @xmath1 and the phase @xmath54 space for a better understanding of the escape mechanism . in the physical @xmath1 space we consider orbits with initial conditions",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 , while the initial value of @xmath57 is obtained from the jacobian integral ( [ ham ] ) . in particular , we define a value of @xmath2 , which is kept constant and then we follow the evolution of the 3d orbits with initial conditions @xmath58 , @xmath56 . thus , we are able to construct a 2d plot depicting the physical @xmath59 plane but with an additional value of @xmath2 , since we deal with 3d motion .",
    "all the initial conditions of the 3d orbits lie inside the limiting zero velocity curve ( zvc ) defined by @xmath60 similarly , for the phase @xmath54 space we consider orbits with initial conditions @xmath61 , @xmath62 , while this time the initial value of @xmath63 is obtained from the energy integral ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "once more , the 3d orbits are launched with a specific value of @xmath2 and with initial conditions @xmath64 , @xmath62 .",
    "the limiting curve which surrounds all the initial conditions of the 3d orbits and defines the allowed area on the 2d phase plane is @xmath65    in both cases , the step separation of the initial conditions along the @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( physical space ) and @xmath26 and @xmath23 ( phase space ) axes ( or in other words the density of the grids ) was controlled in such a way that always there are about @xmath66 orbits , depending on the value of the jacobian integral .",
    "the equations of motion as well as the variational equations for the initial conditions of all grids were integrated using a double precision bulirsch - stoer ` fortran 77 ` algorithm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a small time step of order of @xmath67 , which is sufficient enough for the desired accuracy of our computations ( i.e. , our results practically do not change by halving the time step ) . here",
    "we should emphasize , that our previous numerical experience suggests that the bulirsch - stoer integrator is both faster and more accurate than a double precision runge - kutta - fehlberg algorithm of order 7 with cash - karp coefficients . throughout all our computations , the jacobian energy integral ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) was conserved better than one part in @xmath68 , although for most orbits it was better than one part in @xmath69 .    in dynamical systems with escapes",
    "an issue of paramount importance is the determination of the position as well as the time at which an orbit escapes .",
    "for all values of energy smaller than the critical value @xmath70 ( escape energy ) , the 3d equipotential surface is closed . on the other hand , when @xmath36 the equipotential surface is open and extend to infinity .",
    "the value of the energy itself however , does not furnish a sufficient condition for escape .",
    "an open equipotential surface consists of two branches forming channels through which an orbit can escape to infinity ( see fig . [ surf3d ] ) .",
    "it was proved @xcite that in hamiltonian systems at every opening there is a highly unstable periodic orbit close to the line of maximum potential which is called a lyapunov orbit .",
    "such an orbit reaches the zvc , on both sides of the opening and returns along the same path thus , connecting two opposite branches of the zvc .",
    "lyapunov orbits are very important for the escapes from the system , since if an orbit intersects any one of these orbits with velocity pointing outwards moves always outwards and eventually escapes from the system without any further intersections with the surface of section ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when @xmath35 the lagrangian points exist precisely but at @xmath36 an unstable lyapunov periodic orbit is located close to each of these two points ( e.g. , * ?",
    "the lagrangian points are saddle points of the effective potential , so when @xmath36 , a star must pass close enough to one of these points in order to escape .",
    "thus , in the case of a tidally limited star cluster the escape criterion is purely geometric . in particular ,",
    "escapers are defined to be those stars moving in 3d orbits beyond the tidal radius ( 1 pc ) thus passing one of the two lagrangian points @xcite .",
    "time units .",
    "the horizontal , blue , dashed line corresponds to the threshold value @xmath71 which separates regular from chaotic motion .",
    "the chaotic orbit needs only about 150 time units in order to cross the threshold , while on the other hand , the sticky orbit requires a considerable longer integration time of about 5000 time units so as to reveal its true chaotic nature . ]",
    "the physical and the phase space are divided into the escaping and non - escaping ( trapped ) space .",
    "usually , the vast majority of the trapped space is occupied by initial conditions of regular orbits forming stability islands where a third , non - classical integral , also known as  adelphic integral \" , is present . in many systems",
    "however , trapped chaotic orbits have also been observed .",
    "therefore , we decided to distinguish between regular and chaotic trapped orbits . over the years",
    ", several chaos indicators have been developed in order to determine the character of orbits . in our case , we chose to use the smaller alingment index ( sali ) method .",
    "the sali @xcite has been proved a very fast , reliable and effective tool , which is defined as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the alignments indices , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are two deviation vectors which initially point in two random directions . for distinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion , all we have to do is to compute the sali along time interval @xmath77 of numerical integration . in particular , we track simultaneously the time - evolution of the main orbit itself as well as the two deviation vectors @xmath75 and @xmath76 in order to compute the sali .",
    "the time - evolution of sali strongly depends on the nature of the computed orbit since when an orbit is regular the sali exhibits small fluctuations around non zero values , while on the other hand , in the case of chaotic orbits the sali after a small transient period it tends exponentially to zero approaching the limit of the accuracy of the computer @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the particular time - evolution of the sali allow us to distinguish fast and safely between regular and chaotic motion . the time - evolution of a regular ( r ) and a chaotic ( c ) orbit for a time period of @xmath79 time units is presented in fig .",
    "[ salis ] .",
    "we observe , that both regular and chaotic orbits exhibit the expected behavior .",
    "nevertheless , we have to define a specific numerical threshold value for determining the transition from order to chaos . after conducting extensive numerical experiments , integrating many sets of orbits ,",
    "we conclude that a safe threshold value for the sali is the value @xmath71 .",
    "the horizontal , blue , dashed line in fig .",
    "[ salis ] corresponds to that threshold value which separates regular from chaotic motion . in order to decide whether an orbit is regular or chaotic",
    ", one may follow the usual method according to which we check after a certain and predefined time interval of numerical integration , if the value of sali has become less than the established threshold value . therefore , if sali @xmath80 the orbit is chaotic , while if sali @xmath81 the orbit is regular thus making the distinction between regular and chaotic motion clear and beyond any doubt . for the computation of sali we used the ` lp - vi",
    "` code @xcite , a fully operational routine which efficiently computes a suite of many chaos indicators for dynamical systems in any number of dimensions .",
    "in our computations , we set @xmath79 time units ( at the order of one hubble time ) as a maximum time of numerical integration .",
    "the vast majority of orbits ( regular and chaotic ) however , need considerable less time to find one of the two exits in the limiting surface and eventually escape from the system ( obviously , the numerical integration is effectively ended when an orbit passes through one of the escape channels and escapes ) .",
    "nevertheless , we decided to use such a vast integration time just to be sure that all orbits have enough time in order to escape .",
    "remember , that there are the so called  sticky orbits \" which behave as regular ones during long periods of time .",
    "a characteristic example of a sticky orbit ( s ) can be seen in fig .",
    "[ salis ] , where we observe that the chaotic character of the particular sticky orbit is revealed only after a considerable long integration time of about 5000 time units .",
    "here we should clarify , that orbits which do not escape after a numerical integration of @xmath79 time units ( 10 billion years ) are considered as non - escaping or trapped .",
    "in fact , orbits with escape periods equal to many hubble times are completely irrelevant to our investigation since they lack physical meaning .",
    "the main objective of our investigation is to determine which orbits escape and which remain trapped , distinguishing simultaneously between regular and chaotic trapped motion .",
    "furthermore , two additional properties of the orbits will be examined : ( i ) the channels through which the stars escape and ( ii ) the time - scale of the escapes ( we shall also use the terms escape period or escape rates ) . in the present paper , we shall explore these dynamical quantities for various values of the energy , always within the interval @xmath82 $ ] , as well as for the initial value of the @xmath0 coordinate . in particular , three different cases are considered : ( a ) orbits starting very close to the @xmath1 plane with low value of @xmath2 , ( b ) orbits having a intermediate initial value of @xmath2 and ( c ) orbits launched at relatively large distance from the @xmath1 plane thus with high value of @xmath2 .",
    "our numerical calculations indicate that apart from the escaping orbits there is always a considerable amount of non - escaping orbits . in general terms",
    ", the majority of non - escaping regions corresponds to initial conditions of regular orbits , where the adelphic integral of motion is present , restricting their accessible phase space and therefore hinders their escape . however , there are also chaotic orbits which do not escape within the predefined interval of @xmath79 time units and remain trapped for vast periods ( even up to 100 hubble times ) until they eventually escape to infinity . therefore , we decided to classify the initial conditions of orbits in both the physical and phase space into four main categories : ( i ) orbits that escape through @xmath16 , ( ii ) orbits that escape through @xmath17 , ( iii ) non - escaping regular orbits and ( iv ) trapped chaotic orbits .",
    "additional numerical computations reveal that the non - escaping regular orbits are mainly 3d tube orbits for which the adelphic integral applies , while other types of secondary resonant orbits are also present . in fig .",
    "[ orbs]a we present an example of a 1:1:0 thin @xmath0-tube orbit , while in fig .",
    "[ orbs]b a characteristic example of a secondary 3:3:0 resonant orbit is shown .",
    "the @xmath83 notation we use for the regular orbits is according to @xcite and @xcite , where the ratio of those integers corresponds to the ratio of the main frequencies of the orbit , where main frequency is the frequency of greatest amplitude in each coordinate .",
    "main amplitudes , when having a rational ratio , define the resonances of an orbit . finally in figs .",
    "[ orbs]c - d we observe two orbits escaping through @xmath16 ( exit channel 1 ) and @xmath17 ( exit channel 2 ) , respectively . both regular orbits shown in figs .",

    "[ orbs]c - d were calculated for 5 time units more than the corresponding escape period in order to visualize better the escape trail .",
    "our exploration begins considering 3d orbits starting very close to the primary @xmath1 plane with initial condition @xmath85 .",
    "[ grd1 ] shows the structure of the physical @xmath1 and phase @xmath54 space for several values of the energy , where the four basic types of orbits are indicated with different colors .",
    "specifically , gray color corresponds to regular non - escaping orbits , yellow color corresponds to trapped chaotic orbits , red color corresponds to orbits escaping through channel 1 , while the initial conditions of orbits escaping through exit channel 2 are marked with green color .",

    "( [ zvc1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ zvc2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "here we should note that since @xmath86 is mirror - symmetrical to all axes , the asymmetry ( also known as  coriolis asymmetry \" ) seen in the plots is due to the presence of the coriolis forces @xcite .",
    "we observe , that our results are very similar with those of the 2d system presented in fig .",
    "5 of paper i however , there are also major differences .",
    "in particular , it can be seen that for all three energy levels the stability regions with initial conditions of non - escaping regular orbits are almost identical with those of the 2d system .",
    "the regular areas correspond mainly to retrograde orbits ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( i.e. , when a star revolves around the cluster in the opposite sense with respect to the motion of the cluster around the parent galaxy ) , while there are also some smaller stability islands of prograde orbits . similarities for the basins of escape when @xmath21 and @xmath87 with the corresponding results of paper i are also observed .",
    "the most noticeable difference on the structure of both types of planes on the other hand , is the amount of trapped chaotic orbits . for @xmath88 , that is an energy level just above the critical threshold value @xmath70",
    ", we see that the vast majority of initial conditions correspond to trapped chaotic orbits , while only a tiny portion manage to escape within the predefined time interval of numerical integration .",
    "as we proceed to higher energy levels however , the amount of trapped chaotic orbits reduces significantly .",
    "at the same time , the phase space is occupied by several exit regions where we observe a high dependence of the escape mechanism on the particular initial conditions of the orbits . in other words ,",
    "a minor change in the initial conditions has as a result the star to escape through the opposite escape channel , which is of course a classical indication of chaotic motion .",
    "moreover , with increasing energy the area in the phase spaces becomes less and less fractal and well - defined basins of escape emerge , where by the term basin of escape , we refer to a local set of initial conditions that corresponds to a certain escape channel .",
    "we would like to point that for @xmath21 and @xmath87 , in both the physical and phase space , we identify the existence of thin rings of escaping orbits inside the main stability island of regular orbits .",
    "this behaviour however , was not observed in the 2d model of paper i. we are convinced that these rings composed of initial conditions of escaping are connected to the outer world at high enough values of @xmath0 ( see also figs .",
    "[ xc ] and [ xz ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ percs1](a - b ) we present the evolution of the percentages of all types of orbits on the physical and phase space when the dimensionless energy parameter @xmath34 varies .",
    "one may observe , that when @xmath88 , that is just above the critical energy level @xmath70 , escaping orbits are practical absent ( with rates less than 1% ) , while both the physical and phase spaces are covered almost entirely with initial conditions of bounded orbits ( non - escaping regular plus trapped chaotic ) .",
    "in particular , about 80% of the physical space and 20% of the phase space corresponds to trapped chaotic orbits , while the remaining is occupied by stability islands of non - escaping regular orbits .",
    "as the value of energy increases however , the percentage of trapped motion reduces , while at the same time , the amount of escaping orbits grows steadily .",
    "the rate of trapped chaotic orbits drops rapidly in the interval @xmath89 $ ] and at the highest energy level studied @xmath90 it vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "the percentage of regular non - escaping orbits is much less affected by the shifting of the energy displaying a slow but constant reduction roughly from 20% to 10% and from 30% to 20% in the physical and phase space , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the rates of escaping orbits is the same in both planes only for @xmath91 , where the amount of escaping orbits through exits 1 and 2 increases linearly and almost identically . in the physical space for @xmath92",
    "we see that the percentage of escaping orbits through @xmath16 exhibits a decrease and for @xmath87 they occupy only about one fifth of the plane , while the rate of escaping orbits through @xmath17 continuous to grow and for @xmath87 they dominate covering about 70% of the physical space . on the contrary , in the phase space",
    "it is seen that the amount of escaping orbits is still increasing linearly , although with smaller slope than before , and the percentages of both exit channels are almost the same reaching about 40% at the highest energy level studied .    the following fig .",
    "[ tesc1 ] shows how the escape times @xmath93 of orbits are distributed on both the physical @xmath1 and phase @xmath54 space .",
    "light reddish colors correspond to fast escaping orbits with short escape periods , dark blue / purple colors indicate large escape rates , while white color denote both non - escaping regular and trapped chaotic orbits .",
    "it is evident , that orbits with initial conditions close to the boundaries between the escape basins , that is , the fractal area of the plots need significant amount of time in order to escape from the cluster , while on the other hand , inside the basins of escape where there is no dependence on the initial conditions whatsoever , we measured the shortest escape rates of the orbits .",

    "the pattern however , changes drastically for @xmath21 where it can be seen that the escape periods of orbits with initial conditions in the fractal basin boundaries are huge corresponding to tens of thousands of time units .",
    "this phenomenon is anticipated because in this case the width of the escape channels is still relatively small and therefore , the orbits should spend much time inside the equipotential surface until they find one of the two openings and eventually escape to infinity .",

    "the degree of fractalization however , reduces significantly for @xmath87 , where several well - defined basins of escape are present and the two openings appear themselves again .",

    "we also observe that just above the escape energy the amount of escaping orbits is practically zero ( less than 1% ) , with increasing energy however , their percentage displays a constant linear increase in both planes . in the physical @xmath1 plane",
    "the increase becomes less rapid for @xmath92 , as the slope decreases , and at the highest energy level studied escaping orbits take over occupying more than 90% of the available physical space . on the contrary , in the phase @xmath54 plane the rapid linear increase of the percentages of escaping orbits remains constant throughout the entire range of the energy levels and for @xmath87 they share about 74% of the phase space . looking the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ percs3](a - b ) we may conclude that when orbits are started with a high initial value of @xmath2 , the two escape channels can be considered equiprobable in both types of planes , taking into account that the rates of escaping orbits of both channels is almost the same throughout .",

    "it should be pointed out that in the blow - ups of the diagrams several additional tiny islands of stability have been identified .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows the percentages of the four main types of orbits in the color - coded grids shown in fig .",

    "[ xc ] and [ xz ] we may conclude that the key factor that determines and controls the escape times of the orbits is the value of the energy ( the higher the energy level the shorter the escape rates ) , while the same quantity ( the escape time ) seems to be less affected by the initial value of the @xmath0 coordinate of the orbits .",
    "as it was detailed presented in the previous section , our numerical calculations indicate that at low energy levels , very close to the critical escape energy , the vast majority of the tested initial conditions corresponds to trapped chaotic orbits . here",
    "we will try to interpret and also justify the phenomenon of trapped chaos . by the term  trapped chaos \" we refer to the case where a chaotic orbit remains trapped for a vast time interval inside an open equipotential surface . at this point",

    "sticky orbits are those who behave regularly for long time periods before their true chaotic nature is fully revealed . in our case on the other hand , this type of orbits exhibit chaoticity very quickly as it takes no more than about 200 time units for the sali to cross the threshold value ( sali @xmath112 ) , thus identifying beyond any doubt their chaotic character . therefore , the main question still remains unanswered : why almost all chaotic orbits are trapped at low energy levels ?    in the following fig .",
    "[ trap](a - b ) we observe the time - evolution of the @xmath26 and @xmath0 coordinates of a 3d orbit with initial conditions : @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath85 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( derived from the jacobi integral ) when @xmath88 .",

    "this particular orbit is trapped chaotic and as we can see a huge time of numerical integration , about 842000 time units ( more than 84 times the hubble time ) is required so that the orbit can escape from channel 1 .",
    "we experimented with several trapped chaotic orbits at low energy levels and the obtained results were very similar .",
    "stars moving in chaotic orbits restricted inside the interior region of the cluster having large escape times have also been reported in previous investigations ( see e.g. , fig . 11 in * ? ? ?",
    "our exploration of both the physical and phase space revealed that the escape time of an orbit is directly related to its energy value .",
    "it was also found that the value of the energy strongly influences the geometry of the left and right outer parts of the 3d equipotential surface , where the exit channels are located .",
    "in particular , the two symmetrical escape channels become more and more wide with increasing energy .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cevol]a where we present the structure of the @xmath41 contour slice of the 3d equipotential surface when @xmath118 , for three energy levels @xmath119 ( from inside outwards ) .",

    "we observe that the area exhibits an exponential increase as we proceed to higher energy levels .",
    "in fact , for @xmath122 the area is very limited which means that the width of the exit channels is too small .",
    "this geometrical feature justifies the fact why for low energy values , chaotic orbits consume large time periods wandering inside the open equipotential surface until they eventually locate one of the two exits and escape to infinity .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that it is the geometrical shape of the exit channels at low energy levels , which is mainly responsible for the occurrence of the phenomenon of trapped chaos in star clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ cevol]c we present the evolution of the average value of the escape time @xmath123 of orbits as a function of the dimensionless energy parameter , for three values of @xmath2 .",
    "one may observes that in all cases the average escape time of orbits reduces rapidly with increasing energy and for @xmath92 , the average escape time seems to saturate around 100 time units .",
    "we feel it is important to justify this behaviour of the escape time .",
    "this can be done by exploiting the geometrical feature of the width of the escape channels discussed earlier in fig .",

    "[ cevol]d shows the evolution of the percentage of the total area on the phase space corresponding to basins of escape , as a function of the energy parameter for the three initial values of the @xmath0-coordinate .",

    "when @xmath85 on the other hand , that is the case where the 3d orbits are initiated close to the @xmath1 plane , basins of escape appear quite early and they start to grow rapidly occupying about half of the phase space at the highest energy level studied . thus , we may deduce that for high values of @xmath2 the degree of fractalization is very high , while as we proceed to lower values of @xmath2 the fractility of the phase space is restricted and confined and well - formed basins of escape emerge in the phase space .",
    "chaotic orbits * do not * admit a third integral of motion , so according to classical chaos theory for time @xmath125 they will fill all the available space inside the equipotential surface , unless they escape . in other words ,",
    "given enough time of numerical integration all trapped chaotic orbits will eventually pass through an exit channel and escape from the cluster . to prove this , we reconstructed the color - coded grids of initial conditions in the physical and in the phase space for @xmath88 and @xmath85 shown previously in fig .",

    "[ s0](a - b ) , one may identify a very small amount of remaining trapped chaotic orbits ( about 0.83% in the physical and 1.26% in the phase space ) with escape times larger than @xmath126 time units .",
    "however , we have to point out that even though that these orbits do eventually escape they must be considered as trapped chaotic ones ( not as late escapers ) , taking into account that these orbits correspond to trajectories of stars moving inside a cluster and therefore , escape times larger than one hubble time have no physical meaning whatsoever .",
    "the scope of this work was to shed some light to the trapped or escaping nature of three - dimensional orbits in a star cluster embedded in the steady tidal field of a parent galaxy .",
    "the jacobi integral of motion has a critical threshold value ( or escape energy ) which determines if the escape process is possible or not .",
    "in particular , for energies smaller than the threshold value , the equipotential surface is closed and it is certainly true that escape is impossible .",
    "for energy levels larger than the escape energy however , the equipotential surface opens and two exit channels appear through which the particles can escape to infinity . here",
    "it should be emphasized , that if a test particle does have energy larger than the escape value , there is no guarantee that the star will certainly escape from the cluster and even if escape does occur , the time required for an orbit to transit through an exit and hence escape to infinity may be vary long compared with the natural escaping time .",
    "we managed to distinguish between ordered / chaotic and trapped / escaping orbits and we also located the basins of escape leading to different exit channels , finding correlations with the corresponding escape times of the orbits .",
    "our extensive and thorough numerical investigation strongly suggests , that the overall escape mechanism is a very complicated procedure and very dependent on the value of the jacobi integral , as well as on the initial value of the @xmath0 coordinate used for launching the orbits .",
    "since a distribution function of the model was not available so as to use it for extracting the different samples of orbits , we had to follow an alternative path .",
    "we decided to restrict our exploration to a subspace ( a 4d grid ) of the whole 6d phase space .",
    "thus , we were able to construct again 2d plots depicting the physical @xmath1 and the phase @xmath54 plane but with an additional value of @xmath2 , since we deal with 3d motion . following this approach , we identified again regions of order / chaos and bound / escape .",
    "we defined for several values of the jacobi integral , dense uniform grids of initial conditions @xmath129 and @xmath64 regularly distributed in the area allowed by the energy level on the physical and phase space , respectively . in each type of grid the step separation of the initial conditions along the axes ( or in other words the density of the grid )",
    "was controlled in such a way that there are always at least @xmath66 orbits to be integrated and classified . for the numerical integration of the orbits in each type of grid",

    "] of cpu time on a pentium dual - core 2.2 ghz pc , depending on the escape rates of orbits in each case .",
    "for each initial condition , the maximum time of the numerical integration was set to be equal to @xmath79 time units ( at the order of one hubble time ) however , when a particle escaped the numerical integration was effectively ended and proceeded to the next initial condition .",
    "we used the analysis of the 2d system presented in paper i as a starting point and we expanded our investigation into three dimensions .",
    "the novel element of this paper is determination of the influence of the total orbital energy , as well as of the initial value of the @xmath0 coordinate of the three - dimensional orbits on the escape process .",
    "judging by the detailed outcomes we may say that our task has been successfully completed . the main numerical results of our research can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in",
    "all examined cases , areas of bounded motion and regions of initial conditions leading to escape in a given direction ( basins of escape ) , were found to exist in both the physical and the phase space .",
    "the several escape basins are very intricately interwoven and they appear either as well - defined broad regions or thin elongated bands .",
    "regions of bounded orbits first and foremost correspond to stability islands of regular orbits where an adelphic integral of motion is present .",
    "2 .   at low energy levels just above the critical jacobi constant we observed the existence of large amounts of chaotic orbits which remain trapped inside the star cluster for time intervals much longer than one hubble time . this phenomenon was , more or less the same , in all three cases studied regardless of the particular value of @xmath2 of the orbits .",
    "thus , we employed the sali method in order to distinguish between non - escaping regular orbits and trapped chaotic ones .",
    "3 .   a strong correlation between the extent of the basins of escape and the value of the jacobi integral was found to exist .",
    "indeed , for low energy levels the structure of both the physical and the phase space exhibits a large degree of fractalization and therefore the majority of orbits escape choosing randomly escape channels . as the value of the energy increases however , the structure becomes less and less fractal and several basins of escape emerge .",
    "the extent of these basins of escape is more prominent at low values of @xmath2 and at high energy levels .",
    "we observed , that in many cases the escape process is highly sensitive dependent on the initial conditions , which means that a minor change in the initial conditions of an orbit lead the test particle to escape through the other exit channel .",
    "these regions are the exact opposite of the escape basins , are completely intertwined with respect to each other ( fractal structure ) and are mainly located in the vicinity of stability islands .",
    "this sensitivity towards slight changes in the initial conditions in the fractal regions implies , that it is impossible to predict through which exit the particle will escape .",
    "it was detected , that for energy levels slightly above the escape energy the majority of the escaping orbits have considerable long escape rates ( or escape periods ) , while as we proceed to higher energies the proportion of fast escaping orbits increases significantly .",
    "this behavior can be justified , if we take into account that with increasing energy the exit channels on the equipotential surface become more and more wide thus the test particles can find easily and faster one of the two exits and escape to infinity . 6 .",
    "our calculations revealed , that the escape times of orbits are directly linked to the basins of escape . in particular , inside the basins of escape as well as relatively away from the fractal domains , the shortest escape rates of the orbits had been measured . on the other hand ,",
    "the longest escape periods correspond to initial conditions of orbits either near the boundaries between the escape basins or in the vicinity of stability islands .",
    "the phenomenon of trapped chaotic orbits at low energy levels was further explored and this behavior was justified by a geometrical feature of the equipotential surface .",
    "specifically , for low values of energy the width of the exit channels is too small therefore , chaotic orbits consume large time periods wandering inside the open equipotential surface until they eventually locate one of the two exits and escape to infinity .",
    "moreover , it was proved that the width of the escape channels grows rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "we hope that the present numerical analysis and the corresponding results to be useful in the active field of the dissolution of tidally limited star clusters .",
    "the outcomes as well as the conclusions of the present research are considered , as an initial effort and also as a promising step in the task of understanding the escape mechanism of three - dimensional orbits in open star clusters .",
    "taking into account that our results are encouraging , it is in our future plans to focus our attention on exploring in detail the fate of escaping stars moving into the so - called tidal tails or tidal arms .",

    "<S> the aim of this work is to explore the escape process of three - dimensional orbits in a star cluster rotating around its parent galaxy in a circular orbit . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational field of the cluster is represented by a smooth , spherically symmetric plummer potential , while the tidal approximation was used to model the steady tidal field of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we conduct a thorough numerical analysis distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping orbits , considering only unbounded motion for several energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> it is of particular interest to locate the escape basins towards the two exit channels and relate them with the corresponding escape times of the orbits . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we split our investigation into three cases depending on the initial value of the @xmath0 coordinate which was used for launching the stars . </S>",
    "<S> the most noticeable finding is that the majority of stars initiated very close to the primary @xmath1 plane move in chaotic orbits and they remain trapped for vast time intervals , while orbits with relatively high values of @xmath2 on the other hand , form well - defined basins of escape . </S>",
    "<S> it was also observed , that for energy levels close to the critical escape energy the escape rates of orbits are large , while for much higher values of energy most of the orbits have low escape periods or they escape immediately to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our outcomes to be useful for a further understanding of the dissolution process and the escape mechanism in open star clusters .    </S>",
