    "before discussing our model , let us briefly review the calculation of @xmath15 in the mssm and its concomitant problems . at tree level , the lightest scalar higgs mass is bounded from above by @xmath16 .",
    "the bound is saturated in the decoupling limit where the pseudoscalar higgs mass is taken to infinity : @xmath17 . in determining the upper bound in @xmath1",
    ", we will take this limit for the remainder of the paper .",
    "there are several large corrections to this bound , but they are essentially dominated by terms in the effective potential of the form @xmath18 .",
    "these corrections have been calculated by a large number of authors and reviewed already in several other papers  @xcite .",

    "the first term in square brackets is the famously large ( @xmath22 ) correction to the light higgs mass , while the first term in parenthesis is a smaller d - term contribution .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath23 are corrections due to left - right top squark mixing . here",
    "@xmath23 is defined as x_t = ( 1- ) where @xmath24 is the top squark mixing parameter .",
    "the remaining terms in eq .",
    "( [ mssm ] ) are the leading 2-loop effects , which we will keep throughout this analysis .",
    "the size of the corrections is logarithmically dependent on the `` cut - off '' which is here the mass scale of the top squarks : @xmath25 . for simplicity",
    "( and following standard conventions ) we will take all squarks to be degenerate , apart from mass splittings induced by mixing . to find an upper bound on @xmath15",
    "is it customary to take @xmath14 as large as possible consistent with our prejudices about fine tuning .",
    "usually this means taking @xmath26 . using that value ,",
    "one finds for the unmixed case ( @xmath27 ) that @xmath28 .",
    "the light higgs mass is maximized for the case @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) where one find @xmath31 .",
    "these two extrema are usually referred to as the minimal and maximal mixing scenarios .",
    "current experimental constraints on @xmath15 already rule out a substantial portion of the mass range of the light higgs . for large @xmath32 ,",
    "the sm higgs bound translates directly over to the mssm and one has @xmath33 at 90% cl  @xcite .",
    "one can turn this around and ask how large @xmath14 must be in order to conform to experiment .",
    "for example , if @xmath34 one finds that @xmath35 .",
    "such a large value for @xmath14 will induce rather large corrections ( of @xmath36 ) for the mass parameters in the higgs potential . in order to generate a vev of @xmath37",
    ", one must assume a delicate cancellation , either between the @xmath38-term and the higgs mass parameters , or between the bare mass parameters and their one - loop corrections  @xcite .",
    "in either guise , this tuning ( usually called the `` little hierarchy problem '' ) has led many theorists to consider ways to extend the mssm in order to push up @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we will be doing something similar but not exactly the same .",
    "our goal is not to solve this little hierarchy problem , but rather to ask how far we can push the higgs mass consistent with phenomenological bounds and gauge coupling unification .",
    "some of the parameter space we are considering will require fine - tuning as in the little hierarchy problem , some will not , as we will discuss later .",
    "it has long been understood that one can extend the matter sector of the mssm and still preserve the beautiful result of gauge coupling unification if the new matter falls into complete multiplets of su(5 ) .",
    "that is , the quantum numbers of the new matter must exactly fill up representations of su(5 ) ; there is no need for su(5 ) to be respected by the interactions , just by the matter content .",
    "such complete , but light , gut multiplets are not unexpected . within",
    "string theory one often finds light multiplets in the spectrum . and even within the framework of guts themselves one can find extra complete multiplets lying at the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "in particular , if a symmetry prevents a multiplet from receiving a gut - scale mass , that multiplet will then usually get its mass from susy - breaking effects , which naturally places it at the weak scale .",
    "however there are stringent constraints on new light matter from a number of sides .",
    "most important are the constraints from the @xmath39 and @xmath40 parameters which limit the number of additional _ chiral _ generations .",
    "consistent with these constraints , one must add new matter which is predominantly vector - like and only has a chiral mass which is subdominant .",
    "since the smallest representations of su(5 ) are chiral , we must therefore introduce them in pairs ( , @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) in order to allow explicit mass terms .",
    "but we must also allow for the possibility that these fields couple to the higgs fields of the mssm .",
    "for example , with a @xmath43 a mass term of the form @xmath44 is allowed , not the entire @xmath45 , since @xmath6 represents only a part of a complete @xmath46 representation .",
    "we use a similar shortcut when we write @xmath47 and @xmath48 . ] .",
    "if we allow sm singlets , then dirac mass terms of the form @xmath47 and @xmath48 are also permitted .",
    "how large can the new yukawa couplings be ?",
    "there are two severe constraints .",
    "the first comes from the @xmath40 parameter . in the limit @xmath49 ,",
    "the contribution from a single chiral fermion is approximately  @xcite : @xmath50   \\label{tpar}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the new yukawa coupling , @xmath51 is vev of corresponding higgs field , and @xmath52 counts the additional degrees of freedom possessed by the new field .",
    "precision electroweak data constrains @xmath53 for @xmath54 or @xmath55 for @xmath56  @xcite . as a figure of merit",
    ", we will take @xmath57 as a realistic bound and apply it in our analysis .",
    "then it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ tpar ] ) that when @xmath58 is around 1  tev the yukawa coupling @xmath5 can be @xmath59 !",
    "the second constraint comes from perturbativity and unification .",
    "if we are to maintain natural gauge coupling unification , then we must also maintain perturbativity of the gauge and yukawa couplings at all scales below @xmath60 .",
    "a new @xmath59 coupling presents a problem both in its own evolution towards the gut scale , but also in its effect on the running of the top quark yukawa , which is already known to be near its quasi - fixed point . since the self - coupling of any new yukawa would drive that same yukawa up in the ultraviolet , and",
    "may also drive up @xmath61 , the new yukawa coupling can not be too large .",
    "for example , the @xmath44 coupling can not be larger than @xmath62 .",
    "even worse , the @xmath47 coupling can not be larger than @xmath63 .",
    "perturbativity and unification also bound the amount of new matter than can be added to the mssm , since each new representation _ increases _ the gauge @xmath64-functions .",
    "one finds that one can safely add to the low - energy ( tev - scale ) spectrum only the following : _",
    "( i ) _ up to 4 pairs of @xmath65 s , or _",
    "( ii ) _ one pair of @xmath66 , or _ ( iii ) _",
    "one pair of each , @xmath67 .",
    "the last option of course also fits nicely into an so(10 ) model .",
    "in addition , any number of gauge singlets can be added without upsetting unification or perturbativity .",
    "cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) have been studied extensively before .",
    "for example , moroi and okada  @xcite concluded that the mass of the lightest cp even higgs mass could be pushed up as high as 160  gev consistent with all perturbativity constraints .    by itself , case ( i ) does not allow for any new yukawa coupling unless the new states in the @xmath68 are mixed into the usual @xmath69-quarks and leptons .",
    "such a possibility is even more strongly constrained ( by flavor violation and unitarity of the ckm matrix , among others ) and so we will forbid all such mixing . in the next section an explicit argument for doing so will appear .",
    "but we can generate new yukawa couplings for case ( i ) if we introduce gauge singlet fields @xmath39 and @xmath70 which couple to the usual higgs bosons as @xmath71 and @xmath48 .",
    "more explicitly , we decompose the @xmath46 as @xmath72 and @xmath68 as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 have the same quantum numbers as the @xmath76-quarks and @xmath77 leptons of the sm . then we generate a superpotential with only two new yukawa interactions . for one pair of @xmath41 and one pair of singlets @xmath78 ,",
    "the superpotential is : @xmath79 where we have taken a common vector - like mass for simplicity .",
    "thus the lepton - like pieces of the @xmath46 and @xmath68 get dirac _ and _ vector - like masses , while leaving the @xmath69-quark - like pieces with only vector - like masses .    because the new matter couples to the sm higgs fields",
    ", they will generate radiative corrections in much the same way as the top quark and squarks . and like the top / bottom sector",
    ", the coupling to @xmath6 will play a much more dominant role in those corrections than the coupling to @xmath80 , assuming @xmath81 .",
    "this is important because both the @xmath5 and @xmath82 couplings will tend to run to large values in the ultraviolet .",
    "for example , if we have @xmath52 pairs of @xmath83 and if all couple with the same strength @xmath5 then : and @xmath61 .",
    "however we only show the 1-loop contributions here in order to be concise . ]",
    "@xmath84 . \\label{rge11}\\ ] ] of perhaps even greater importance is the rge for @xmath61 , which has a new contribution proportional to @xmath85 : y_t = _ mssm + y_t^2 . because @xmath5 and @xmath61 are coupled through their rges",
    ", @xmath5 is more tightly constrained than @xmath82 .",
    "however the mass of the lightest higgs , @xmath86 , is much more sensitive to @xmath5 than it is to @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore , very large values of @xmath82 will actually drive the higgs mass _ down_. therefore we will take @xmath87 for the remainder of this work .    running the rges for @xmath5 and @xmath61 from the weak scale to the gut scale ( which we take as @xmath88 )",
    ", we find an upper bound on @xmath5 of @xmath63 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( assuming @xmath92 ) .",
    "calculating the correction to the higgs mass ( formulas to follow in next section ) yields a new upper bound on @xmath1 which is at most @xmath93 above the mssm limit , not much of an improvement .",
    "of course the correction to @xmath94 scales as @xmath95 , so if we were able to significantly increase the low - energy value of @xmath5 we could generate much larger higgs masses , as we will now see .",
    "models with extra pairs of @xmath65 s present one extra degree of freedom in model building . specifically ,",
    "if one has @xmath52 pairs of @xmath41 then one can impose on them a new @xmath7 symmetry under which the sm particles are uncharged . as a global symmetry , this @xmath7 only serves to constrain the forms of the couplings ; for example , it would prevent mixing between the vector - like quarks and the ordinary quarks unless the symmetry is broken .    as a gauge symmetry ,",
    "there are new opportunities for generating large corrections to @xmath1 .",
    "because it is reminiscent of `` horizontal '' symmetries among the quark generations , we will call this a `` lateral '' symmetry and denote it @xmath96 .",
    "because of perturbativity there are only three possible lateral symmetry groups : @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "( @xmath100 is another possible group , but we will not consider it . ) we will keep most of our discussion general with respect to @xmath52 , but our numerical work will be done for @xmath91 just to be specific .",
    "the non - mssm matter content is then as follows , with the charges under @xmath101 shown : @xmath102 the superpotential is again given by eq .",
    "( [ yuk5 ] ) .",
    "again we will take @xmath103 , which has very little effect on our limits .",
    "the major advantage of gauging the lateral symmetry comes in the rges for @xmath5 .",
    "let us reiterate that in order to maximize the higgs mass correction , we want @xmath5 to be as large as possible at the weak scale .",
    "however a large @xmath5 enters the rge for @xmath61 , driving it to an ultraviolet instability long before the gut scale .",
    "furthermore the @xmath64-function for @xmath5 itself is positive , which means that a large @xmath5 in the infrared only becomes larger , and more troublesome , in the ultraviolet .    gauging the lateral symmetry changes all this because now one finds : @xmath104   \\label{rge1}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the quadratic casimir for the fundamental representation of @xmath96 : @xmath106 .",
    "the rge for the new coupling @xmath107 or @xmath108 is simply : _ = _",
    "^2_where @xmath109 is the numerical @xmath64-function coefficient , to be determined .",
    "how does @xmath108 help ? in eq .",
    "( [ rge1 ] ) it is the gauge pieces that drive down @xmath5 in the ultraviolet , preventing @xmath5 from hitting its landau pole .",
    "more importantly they suppress the contributions of @xmath5 to the running of @xmath61 .",
    "thus much larger values of @xmath5 are possible for non - zero @xmath108 . in fig .",
    "[ kappa ] we graph the upper bound on @xmath5 as a function of @xmath108 for @xmath91 and two cases of @xmath64 : @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "just as the top quark corrections to @xmath112 scale as @xmath113 , so too these new corrections scale as @xmath95 .",
    "so it would appear that larger @xmath108 immediately leads to larger @xmath1 , and to a good approximation this is correct , though not complete .",

    "@xmath115 is analogous to @xmath23 in the stop sector : x _ = ( 1- ) [ x ] where @xmath116 is the @xmath75@xmath70 soft mixing parameter .",
    "we learn several things from the form of eq .",
    "( [ hm2 ] ) .",
    "first , it is clear that the corrections grow as @xmath95 , so large @xmath5 will generate large higgs masses .",
    "second , we notice that the 2-loop piece contains terms suppressed by @xmath108 , so for sufficiently large @xmath108 , the 2-loop suppression of @xmath112 offsets the enhancements generated by the @xmath108-dependence in the rges .    we have outlined here a broad class of models which can significantly increase the susy light higgs mass .",
    "each model is described by only a few free parameters : @xmath52 , the number of @xmath65 multiplets ; @xmath58 , the explicit , susy - preserving mass of those multiplets ; @xmath14 , the soft - breaking mass scale ; @xmath5 , the yukawa coupling of the new matter to @xmath6 ; @xmath108 , the strength of the new @xmath7 gauge interaction ; @xmath109 , the @xmath64-function for @xmath108 ; and of course @xmath117 , the ever - present ratio of the higgs vevs .",
    "as in the mssm , there is also a dependence on the left - right mixing parameters , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which explicitly appear in the higgs mass correction .    in what follows",
    "we will study one particular subclass of models in order to show the power of this approach for lifting the higgs mass predictions .",
    "now we turn our attention to one choice of @xmath52 , namely @xmath91 .",
    "our choice is not dictated by any exceptionally deep reason .",
    "one could argue that the @xmath91 case fits nicely into an @xmath121 unified picture ( where there is an extra pair of @xmath41 in each * 27 * ) and is therefore preferred .",
    "but the @xmath120 case will also highlight all the key points we wish to make .",
    "the matter content ( eq .  ( [ matter ] ) ) and superpotential ( eq .  ( [ yuk5 ] ) ) of the @xmath120 model both follow from the discussion in the previous sections . as before we will make two simplifying assumptions : that all new matter receives a universal vector - like mass @xmath58 and that all susy scalars receive a universal scalar mass @xmath14 . deviations from these assumptions will have only a negligible effect on the derived bound on @xmath1 .    what is not immediately obvious is what we should take for @xmath109 .",
    "the minimal model yields @xmath122 .",
    "in such a model all the matter charged under @xmath120 would be integrated out at the scale @xmath58 . in the infrared the only remaining degrees of freedom",
    "would be gauge and would thus form `` lateral glueballs '' which would not have direct interactions with sm matter .    on the other hand , it would be natural for the model to contains higgs fields to break the lateral symmetry . a model with three higgs fields ,",
    "each in the fundamental of @xmath120 , along with their conjugates would break the lateral symmetry completely .",
    "the resulting model would have @xmath110 .",
    "of course , any additional matter would turn @xmath123 .",
    "this brings us to an interesting question : could an abelian symmetry work for us ?",
    "the answer is no . as we will see shortly , at the weak scale we require the lateral interaction to be fairly strong in order to stabilize the rge flow of @xmath5 and @xmath61 .",
    "an abelian symmetry would have positive @xmath64-function and so the strongly coupled lateral group would become non - perturbative in the ultraviolet .    on the other hand , a negative @xmath64-function allows @xmath108 to be large in the infrared , but suppresses it in the ultraviolet so that its dampening effect on the running of @xmath5 is vitiated .",
    "logically it seems that @xmath110 maximizes the effect that @xmath108 has on the higgs mass calculation , a deduction borne out by the numerical calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ betah ] where explicit dependence on the @xmath64-function is shown . in this figure",
    "we have plotted the upper bound on @xmath1 as a function of @xmath109 for @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "we require in this one plot that @xmath126 and that @xmath108 remains perturbative all the way to the gut scale .",
    "the plot clearly shows @xmath127 as a maximum .",
    "however all @xmath128 are interesting and give sizable enhancements to @xmath1 .",
    "positive @xmath64-functions help very little , since they drive @xmath108 non - perturbative in the ultraviolet and thus necessitate lower values of @xmath108 at the weak scale .",
    "= 2.75 in    our central result is then the maximization of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath108 .",
    "we leave @xmath108 as a free variable since there is a strong dependence on its value .",
    "we also leave @xmath14 free since we have no _ a priori _ reason to choose @xmath129 rather than @xmath130 . and we choose @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    how large can @xmath108 be before our perturbative calculation of the higgs mass begins to fail ? because we assume @xmath131 , there is no problem with perturbativity in the ultraviolet .",
    "furthermore , in the calculation of the new contributions to @xmath112 , the proper expansion parameter is not @xmath108 , but rather @xmath132 .",
    "this is analogous to the qcd contributions to leptonic magnetic moments .",
    "thus our calculation of @xmath1 should work reasonably well even for values of @xmath108 much larger than @xmath133 .    in any case ,",
    "our numerical procedure is simple : for a given value of @xmath108 and @xmath14 , we vary @xmath58 and @xmath5 over their allowed ranges in order to maximize @xmath1 .",
    "the minimum for @xmath58 is set by requiring @xmath57 ; this will of course depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the upper bound for @xmath58 we choose to be @xmath134 arbitrarily . while there is no lower bound on @xmath5 , the upper bound is set by requiring the values of @xmath135 and @xmath136 remain perturbative at all scales @xmath137 .",
    "we have thus far avoided discussing the left - right mixing parameters .",
    "it turns out that these play a crucial role .",
    "it is well known that in the mssm , the higgs mass is maximized for @xmath29 , or equivalently @xmath138 . for fields with both chiral and vector - like masses , the form of @xmath139",
    "is altered to that of eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) .",
    "the one - loop corrections are maximized for @xmath140 , however it may not be possible to reach such large values .",
    "in fact , there are really two distinct cases to be considered , both of which are physically acceptable , though one may ( or may not ) be considered more natural than the other .    the first case is to require that @xmath141 scales with @xmath14 .",
    "for example , in the mssm the requirement that there be no charge- or color - breaking minima in the scalar potential lower than the sm minimum gives us the usual  @xcite : a_t^23(m^2_t_l+m^2_t_r+m^2_h_u ) . since @xmath142 usually",
    ", then we can rewrite this as @xmath143 , assuming @xmath144 .",
    "thus we might also expect that |a_|<. [ ccb1 ] however , because of the presence of the @xmath58 mass term , eq .",
    "( [ ccb1 ] ) generalizes to : a_^2 < 6(m_v^2+^2 ) [ ccb2 ] which allows for much larger values of @xmath141 and thus @xmath115",
    ". there are theoretical arguments both for and against loosening the constraint of eq .",
    "( [ ccb1 ] ) to that of eq .",
    "( [ ccb2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath58 is _ a priori _ independent of @xmath14 , there is no good reason for a soft - breaking parameter like @xmath141 to scale with @xmath58 . and in fact , for @xmath145 , eq .",
    "( [ ccb2 ] ) would allow @xmath141 as large as @xmath146 .",
    "even if such a large @xmath147-term were allowed phenomenologically , it would generate a very large fine - tuning in the soft parameters of the higgs potential .",
    "on the other hand , it would be natural for @xmath58 to be associated with the susy - breaking scale , just as the usual @xmath38-term is presumed to be .",
    "so @xmath141 scaling with @xmath58 may not be as unreasonable as it first appears . in either case",
    ", we will remain agnostic and show the limits under the constraints of eqs .",
    "( [ ccb1 ] ) and ( [ ccb2 ] ) both .",

    "these points are maxima in the following sense .",
    "first , the stop mass correction has been maximized by assuming @xmath29 for the stops .",
    "second , at each point along the curves , the vector - like mass , @xmath58 , has been allowed to vary within the range 500m_v 2[mv ] in order to maximize the size of the corrections . the lower bound in eq .",
    "( [ mv ] ) has been chosen to satisfy the @xmath40-parameter constraint , and the upper bound ensures that the vector - like matter does not decouple completely .",

    "it is advantageous to have as large a logarithmic enhancement as possible and so @xmath58 should be small . for @xmath108 large , the 2-loop corrections push down @xmath1 if the log is large , and so it is best to have a small log , which requires @xmath58 to be large .",
    "one finds @xmath149 at @xmath150 and @xmath151 when @xmath152 .",
    "this effect is further enhanced by the @xmath40-parameter constraint : larger @xmath108 allow larger @xmath5 which are consistent with @xmath40 only if @xmath58 is larger , and vice - versa .",
    "= 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    obviously there is a strong dependence on @xmath108 , which is to be expected .",
    "as @xmath108 grows , the running of @xmath5 is suppressed and so larger weak - scale values of @xmath5 are consistent with our perturbativity constraints .",
    "of course , as @xmath108 grows the weak scale model itself becomes less and less perturbative .",
    "however we feel that there should be no problem trusting the calculation of the higgs mass correction even at relatively large values of @xmath108 . as a check ,",
    "we have compared the size of the one - loop corrections to those at two loops and find the two - loop corrections to be uniformly small compared to the one - loop pieces , usually only 5% to 20% of the latter .",
    "although our calculation appears to be trustworthy up to at least @xmath153 , one need only go up to @xmath154 in order to generate large corrections to @xmath1 .",

    "now the mixing can become maximal and @xmath115 can approach the magic value of 6 . in this case , there is almost no depedence on @xmath14 and so we show the bound as a single line . notice that for @xmath168 , there is no real difference between the smaller and larger values of @xmath141 .",
    "but for @xmath162 the higgs mass bound has been pushed up from 213 to @xmath169 by the larger @xmath141 values .",
    "hidden in these plots is the dependence of our result on the lateral gauge @xmath64-function . if we take @xmath127 we are in fact maximizing the higgs mass .",
    "we can see this for one particular case in fig .",
    "[ plottwo ] where we plot the maximal values of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath108 just as in fig .",

    "however , the difference is not great , and we would claim that the @xmath170 model is also successful at lifting the higgs mass well above the experimental limits .",
    "the famous upper bound on the higgs mass in the mssm may turn out to be one of the major stumbling blocks of the model and one of our best clues on how to extend it . while it is relatively simple to extend the mssm to push the upper bound on @xmath1 up a few ten s of gev",
    ", larger changes usually require radical alterations of the model which do not allow automatic gut - like unification and suppression of dimension-6 proton decay operators .",
    "we have shown here that it _ is _ possible to extend the mssm in a relatively minimal way and still obtain higgs boson masses as heavy as 200 to @xmath171 .",
    "and we have done so while preserving gauge coupling unification at scales around @xmath172 .",
    "the theoretical price to be paid depends on the enhancement desired . for the largest masses",
    ", one needs either large @xmath14 or large @xmath75@xmath70 mixing through the @xmath141 term .",
    "either choice reintroduces the `` little hierarchy '' problem since the low - energy higgs potential is sensitive to these mass scales .",
    "there is also a `` @xmath38-problem '' associated with setting @xmath58 near the weak scale , but this is presumably solved in the same way that the usual @xmath38-problem is solved .",
    "but most importantly , these models are phenomenologically consistent and do not require any radical changes in the mssm or the `` grand desert '' scenario .    for smaller @xmath1 enhancements of @xmath173 or so , there seems to be little to no price in terms of additional fine - tunings .",
    "in fact , the precision electroweak data strongly prefers higgs masses which are less than 200 to @xmath174  @xcite .",
    "thus we would argue that this model would be a strong contender were the higgs mass bound to continue increasing or if the higgs were to be actually found at masses inconsistent with the mssm but not heavier than about @xmath171 .",

    "<S> while its discovery would complete the sm , it would also bring to the forefront the study of electroweak symmetry breaking and all that comes with it ( supersymmetry , extra dimensions , etc ) . </S>",
    "<S> but discovery of the higgs boson is no simple feat . in particular , the channels in which it can be observed , and thus the methods used to find it , are highly sensitive to its mass , which remains unknown . </S>",
    "<S> though there do exist constraints on @xmath1 from loop processes in the sm , the dependence on @xmath1 is logarithmic and thus small uncertainties in electroweak observables lead to exponentially larger uncertainties in the higgs mass itself .    within the sm , the mass of the higgs boson is not predicted . </S>",
    "<S> while present analyses of the precision radiative constraints within the sm indicate a higgs mass somewhere around 100  gev , the model itself puts only weak constraints on @xmath1 from unitarity : @xmath10  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even after we embed the model in a more complete ultraviolet picture , the added constraints of vacuum stability and triviality only serve to loosely bound the higgs mass range  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( the mssm ) is another story . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the mass of the lightest higgs boson of the mssm is bounded at tree level by the @xmath11 mass . </S>",
    "<S> radiative corrections can push the mass higher , but only to about 125 to @xmath12 for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> ( here @xmath14 represents the average mass of the top squarks . ) </S>",
    "<S> as experiments have pushed the lower mass bound on the higgs higher and higher , the parameter space for susy has been pushed further and further into corners in which top squarks are heavy and left - right mixing is large . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , even small increases in the experimental bound on @xmath1 lead to large increases in the tuning required to make the mssm consistent with experiment  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many groups have examined ways to extend the mssm in order to push up the lightest higgs mass and partially evade the tuning issues  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> generally speaking , the farther one is willing to move away from the basic picture of the mssm , the higher one is able to push the higgs mass . </S>",
    "<S> models which add only a few extra matter representations , or additional higgs multiplets , succeed only in raising the higgs mass bound by a few to few tens of gev . </S>",
    "<S> however there are models which look nothing like the mssm in the ultraviolet , involving for example new strong dynamics in which the mssm degrees of freedom are no longer fundamental . </S>",
    "<S> in such models the upper bound on @xmath1 can be extended by hundreds of gev .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we would like to keep the best of both worlds  minimality but with a large effect . </S>",
    "<S> we will present a model ( actually a class of models ) in which very large corrections to the higgs mass can occur , while remaining as close as possible to the spectrum and interactions of the mssm . in particular , we wish to preserve a property of the mssm which we consider too valuable to abandon , namely gauge coupling unification which occurs at scales sufficiently large to prevent fast proton decay .    </S>",
    "<S> this last property is really two independent requirements , both of which are met in the mssm : first , that the gauge couplings unify numerically and perturbatively , and second that they unify at a sufficiently large scale that the resulting dimension-6 nucleon decay rates are consistent with proton lifetime bounds . </S>",
    "<S> if we are to consider the unification in the mssm as more than a coincidence then there are only a few possible extensions which we may consider : the addition of gauge singlets fields , as in the nmssm  @xcite ; the addition of new matter fields whose quantum numbers fit into complete su(5 ) representations  @xcite ; or the addition of new interactions commuting with the usual gauge groups  @xcite .    of these , the first two have been considered in detail by others and the last only in passing ( since it usually does not help ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider all three in tandem and show that we can generate higgs masses far above those predicted in the mssm . because the quantum numbers of the new matter will allow it to couple to the @xmath6 field </S>",
    "<S> , the new yukawa couplings will generate large corrections to the light higgs mass in much the same way that the top quark / squark loops do in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> but as we will see , the yukawa coupling can be appreciably larger than the top yukawa of the mssm , consistent with perturbative unification , and so the corrections can be extremely large . </S>"
