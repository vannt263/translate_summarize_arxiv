    "the * h*eisenberg s ( or uncertainty ) * r*elations ( hr ) have a large popularity , being frequently regarded as crucial formulae of physics or ( martens 1991 ) even as expression of  the most important principle of the twentieth century physics  .",
    "nevertheless today one knows ( bunge 1977 ) that hr ",
    "are probably the most controverted formulae in the whole of the theoretical physics  .",
    "the controversies originate in the association of the ( supposed special ) characteristics of measurements at atomic scale with hr respectively with the foundation and interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "the respective association was initiated and especially sophisticated within the * t*raditional ( conventional or orthodox ) * i*nterpretation of*hr * ( tihr ) .",
    "very often the tihr  is amalgamated with the so - called copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "elements of the alluded association were preserved one way or another in almost all investigations of hr subsequent to tihr .",
    "it is notable that , in spite of their number and variety , the mentioned investigations have not yet solved in essence the controversies connected with tihr .",
    "but , curiously , today , large classes of publications and scientists seem to omit ( or even to ignore ) discussions about the controversies and defects characterizing the tihr .",
    "so , tacitly , in our days tihr seems to remain a largely adopted doctrine which dominates the questions regarding the foundation and interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "for all that ( piron 1982 )  the idea that there are defects in the foundations of orthodox quantum theory is unquestionable present in the conscience of many physicists  .",
    "no doubt , first of all , the above quoted idea regards questions connected with tihr .",
    "then the respective questions require further studies and probably new views .",
    "we believe that a promising strategy to satisfy such requirements is to develop an investigation guided by the goals presented under the following * p*oints ( * p * ) :    @xmath1 : from the vague multitude of sophisticated statements of tihr to identify its main elements ( hypotheses , arguments / motivations and assertions).@xmath2    @xmath3 : to add together the significant defects of tihr located in connection with the above mentioned elements.@xmath2    @xmath4 : to examine the verity of the respective defects as well as their significance with respect to tihr.@xmath2    @xmath5 : to see if such an examination defends tihr or irrefutably pleads against it.@xmath2    @xmath6 : in the latter case to admit the failure of tihr and to abandon it as an incorrect and useless doctrine.@xmath2    @xmath7 : to see if hr are veritable physical formulae.@xmath8    @xmath9 : to search for a genuine reinterpretation of hr.@xmath8    @xmath10 : to give a ( first ) evaluation of the direct consequences of the mentioned reinterpretation.@xmath2    @xmath11 : to note a few remarks on some adjacent questions.@xmath2    in this paper we wish to develop an investigation of the hr problematic in the spirit of the above mentioned points @xmath12* * @xmath13*. * for such a purpose we will appeal to some elements ( ideas and results ) from our works published in last two decades ( dumitru 1974 a , 1974 b , 1977 , 1980 , 1984 , 1987 , 1988 , 1989 , 1991 , 1993 , 1996 , 1999 ; dumitru and verriets 1995 ) .",
    "but here we strive to incorporate the respective elements into a more argued and elaborated approach .",
    "also we try to make our exposition as self - contained as possible so that the reader should find it sufficiently meaningful and persuasive without any important appeals to other texts .    through the announced investigation we shall find that all the main elements of tihr are affected by insurmountable defects .",
    "therefore we shall reveal the indubitable failure of tihr and the necessity of its abandonment .",
    "then it directly follows that in fact hr do not have any significance connected with the ( measuring ) uncertainties .",
    "that is why in this paper for the respective relations we do not use the wide - spread denomination of  uncertainty relations  .",
    "a consequence of the above alluded revelations is the fact that hr must be deprived of their quality of crucial physical formulae .",
    "so we come in consonance with the guess ( dirac 1963 ) that :  uncertainty relations in their present form will not survive in the physics of future  .",
    "the failure of tihr leaves open a conceptual space which firstly requires justified answers to the questions from @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the respective answers must be incorporated in a concordant view about the subjects of the following points :    @xmath16 : the genuine description of the measurements.@xmath8    @xmath17 : the foundation and the interpretation of the actually known quantum theory.@xmath2    the above mentioned subjects were amalgamated by tihr trough a lot of assertions / assumptions which now appear as fallacious .",
    "that is why we suggest that an useful view to be built on a natural differentiation of the respective subjects .    in such a view",
    "the actual quantum theory must be considered as regarding only intrinsic properties of the entities ( particles and fields ) from the microworld .",
    "the aspects of the respective properties included in the theoretical version of hr refer to the stochastic characteristics of the considered entities . but note that stochastic attributes are specific also in the case some macroscopic physical systems ( e.g. thermodynamical ones ) , characterized by a class of macroscopic formulae similar with hr .",
    "also the planck s constant @xmath0 ( involved in quantum hr ) proves itself to be similar with the boltzmann s constant k ( involved in the mentioned macroscopic formulae ) .",
    "both mentioned constants appear as generic indicators of stochasticity .    in the spirit of the above",
    "suggested view the description of the measurements remains a question which is extrinsic as regards the properties of the considered physical systems .",
    "also it must be additional and independent from the actually known branches of theoretical physics ( including the quantum mechanics ) .",
    "the respective branches refer only to the intrinsic properties of the considered systems .",
    "then the measurements appear as processes which supply out - coming ( received ) information / data about the intrinsic properties of the measured systems .",
    "so regarded the measurements can be described through some mathematical models . in such models",
    "the measuring uncertainties can be described by means of various estimators .",
    "the above announced views about the hr problematic facilitate reconsiderations and ( we think ) nontrivial comments about some questions regarding the foundations of quantum mechanics .    for developing our exposition in the next sections we will quote directly only a restricted number of references .",
    "this because our goal is not to give on exhaustive review of the literature dealing with tihr .",
    "the readers interested in such reviews are invited to consult the known monographical and bibliographical publications ( e.g. : jammer , 1966 ; de witt and graham , 1971 ; jammer , 1974 ; nilson , 1976 ; yanase _ et .",
    "al . _ 1978 ; primas , 1981 ; ballentine , 1982 ; cramer , 1986 ; dodonov and manko , 1987 ; martens , 1991 ; braginski and khalili , 1992 ; omnes 1992,1994 ; bush _ et .",
    "al_. , 1996 ) .",
    "in spite of its popularity , in its promoting literature , tihr is reported rather as a vague multitude of sophisticated statements but not as a systematized ensemble of clearly defined main elements ( hypotheses , arguments / motivations and assertions ) . however , from the respective publications there can be identified and sorted out such on ensemble which , in our opinion , can be presented as follows :    on the best authority ( heisenberg , 1977 ) today it is known that the tihr story originates in the search of general answers to the primary questions mentioned under the following points :    @xmath18are all measurements affected by measuring uncertainties ? @xmath2    @xmath18how can the respective uncertainties be represented quantitatively in a mathematical scheme ?",
    "@xmath19    in connection with *",
    "* @xmath20*,*tihr adopted the following hypotheses :    @xmath18the measuring uncertainties are due to the perturbations of the measured system as a result of its interactions with the measuring instrument.@xmath2    @xmath18 in the case of macroscopic systems the mentioned perturbations can be made arbitrarily small and , consequently , always the corresponding uncertainties can be considered as negligible .",
    "@xmath18 in the case of quantum systems ( microparticles of atomic size ) the alluded perturbations are essentially unavoidable and consequently for certain measurements ( see below @xmath21 ) the corresponding uncertainties are non - negligible.@xmath2    in the shadow of the hypotheses mentioned in @xmath22 and @xmath23 the tihr attention was limited only to the quantum cases . for approaching such cases with respect to @xmath22 tihr restored to the following motivation resources :    @xmath24analysis of some thought ( gedanken ) measuring experiments.@xmath2",
    "@xmath25 : appeal to some theoretical formulae from the existing quantum mechanics.@xmath2    the two resources were used in undisguised association .",
    "so , from the starting - point , in tihr the questions regarding the description of the measurements , respectively the foundation and interpretation of the existing quantum theory , were explicitly amalgamated ..    for accuracy of the discussions in the following we shall use the term _ variable _ in order to denote a physical quantity which describes a specific property / characteristic of a physical system . with adequate delimitations",
    "the respective term will be used in both theoretical and experimental sense . in the former case",
    "it is connected with the theoretical modeling of system . in the latter case",
    "it is related with the data given by measurements about the system .    in connection with @xmath26",
    "there was considered ( heisenberg , 1927 , 1930 ) the case of simultaneous measurements of two ( canonically ) conjugated quantum variables a and b ( such are coordinate q and momentum p or time t and energy e ) .",
    "the correspondingly thought experimental ( te ) uncertainties are @xmath27 and @xmath28 they were found to be interconnected trough the following a - b formula    @xmath29    where @xmath0 is the quantum planck s constant .",
    "as regards @xmath30 firstly there was introduced ( heisenberg 1927 , 1930 ) the following q - p theoretical formula :    @xmath31    ( with equality only for gaussian wave function @xmath32 afterwards , tihr partisans replaced eq .",

    "v ) .    equations ( 2.1 ) - ( 2.2)/(2.3 ) were taken by tihr as motivation supports .",
    "based on the such supports tihr partisans promoted a whole doctrine ( vision ) .",
    "the main ( essential ) elements of the respective doctrine come down to the following points , grouped in pairs of assertions ( a ) and motivations ( m ) :    @xmath38 : the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath39 from eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2)/(2.3 ) denoted by an unique symbol @xmath40 , have an identical significance of measuring _",
    "uncertainty _ for the quantum variable a.@xmath2    @xmath41 : the above mentioned tihr presumptions about @xmath42 and the ( formal ) resemblance between eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2).@xmath8    @xmath43 : equations ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2)/(2.3 ) admit the same generic interpretation of uncertainty relations for simultaneous measurements of the variables @xmath44 and @xmath45.@xmath2    @xmath46 : the presumed significance for @xmath27 and @xmath47 from eq .",

( 2.1 ) - ( 2.3 ) ( and named uncertainty relations ) are typically quantum formulae and they have no similar in classical ( non - quantum ) physics.@xmath2",
    "@xmath62 : presence of the quantum ( planck ) constant @xmath63 in eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) - ( 2.3 ) and its absence in all known formulae of classical physics.@xmath2    the above mentioned points @xmath64 can be regarded as main elements of tihr .",
    "this because any piece of the variety of tihr statements is obtained and advocated by means of some combinations of the respective elements .    among the alluded pieces we mention here the ones regarding the mutual relations of quantum variables .",
    "tihr adopted the idea :    @xmath65 : a variable exists /(can be defined ) only when it is measurable with absolute accuracy ( without uncertainty).@xmath8    @xmath66by combining this idea with @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the tihr literature it is often promoted the statement :    @xmath69 : two quantum variables are compatible respectively incompatible as their operators are respectively are not commutable .",
    "consequently a complete description of a quantum system must be made in terms of a set of mutually compatible variables.@xmath70    in the same literature one finds also the opinion that :    @xmath71 : two incompatible variables ( especially the canonically conjugated ones ) are complementary ( i.e. mutually exclusive ) - similarly as in the complementarity relation for the corpuscular and wave characteristics of microparticles of atomic size.@xmath72",
    "tihr was initiated by heisenberg but later on it was developed and especially promoted by the copenhagen school guided by n. bohr . in a first stage tihr had a relatively modest motivation , based only on the eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) and ( 2.2 ) .",
    "however it was largely accepted in scientific and academic communities , partly due to the authority of its promoters .",
    "so , the establishing of tihr as a doctrine started .    in a second stage tihr partisans introduced a multitude of thought - experimental or theoretical formulae which resemble more or less the eqs .",
    "( 2.1)-(2.3 ) . in spite of their ( conceptual and/or mathematical ) diversity",
    "the respective formulae were declared as _ uncertainty relations _ and their existence and interpretation were regarded as supports for an extended motivation of tihr .",
    "so , for its partisans , tihr was viewed as a well established and irrefutable doctrine .",
    "such a view was widely promoted in leading publications ( especially in textbooks ) .    in the meantime",
    "the alluded view was confronted with the notification of some defects of tihr .",
    "but , as a rule , the respective notifications appeared disparately , sometimes in marginal publications and from non - leading authors .",
    "so the mentioned defects were not presented as a systematized ensemble and tihr was criticized on certain points but not in its totality .",
    "an appreciation viewing somehow the alluded totality was noted altogether solitarily ( primas 1981 ) . referring to the post - copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics it says : ",
    "heisenberg 's uncertainty relations are no longer at the heart of the interpretation but are simple consequences of the basic mathematical formalism  . here",
    "one should remark that , as we know , such an appreciation has never been used in order to elucidate the shortcomings of the tihr doctrine .",
    "moreover it seems that , even in the our - days publications regarding the interpretation of quantum mechanics , the respective appreciation is not taken properly into account .    in the presented circumstances the tihr partisans ignored or even denied the alluded defects",
    "such an attitude was sustained mainly by putting forward thought experiments and/or the authority of the mentioned partisans .",
    "but note that , in this way , for most of the cases , the notifications of tihr defects were not really counteracted and the corresponding controversies were not elucidated . for all that tihr survived over the decades with the appearance of an uncontroversial doctrine and became a veritable myth .",
    "undoubted signs of the respective myth are present even today in publications ( especially in textbooks ) and in the thinking of peoples ( particularly in academic communities ) .    here , it is interesting to observe heisenberg 's own attitude towards tihr story .",
    "it is surprising to see in the afferent literature that , although he was the initiator of tihr doctrine , heisenberg was not involved in the subsequent history of the respective doctrine .",
    "so he did not develop mathematical generalizations or interpreting extensions / sophistications of the eqs .",
    "( 2.1)-(2.3 ) .",
    "also he did not participate in the controversies regarding the tihr defects .",
    "probably that was the reason why in one of his last publications on hr ( heisenberg , 1977 ) he did not refer to such developments and controversies but reminded only his thoughts connected with the beginning of the tihr history .",
    "can the alluded attitude be regarded as an evidence of the supposition that in fact heisenberg was conscious of the insurmountable defects of tihr ?",
    "a pertinent answer to such a question is expected to be ( eventually ) known by the publication of all volumes of a planned monography ( mehra and rechenberg , 1982 ) due , in part , to one of heisenberg 's last collaborators",
    ".    with the heisenberg case one discloses a particularity in the attitude of many scientists who promoted tihr . as individuals ,",
    "each of the respective scientists did not regard the tihr as a whole doctrine but argued for only a few of its elements and ignored almost all of the defects",
    ". often their considerations were amalgamated with ideas which do not pertain strictly to tihr .",
    "that is why , probably , by the term _ tihr - partisans _ it is more adequate to understand a fuzzy class of people rather than a rigorously delimited group of scientists .    now looking back over the time ,",
    "we believe that the verity and true significance of tihr defects still remain open questions which require to be elucidated .. such a requirement implies the necessity of an argued and complete revaluation of tihr .",
    "then , there directly appears the need for a search of a genuine reinterpretation of hr .",
    "the alluded beliefs will guide our investigations in the following sections .",
    "tihr introduced its main elements presented in @xmath73 *  * @xmath74 by appealing to some starting considerations about the eqs .",
    "( 2.1)-(2.3 ) .",
    "the appeals viewed the scientific achievements from the first years of quantum mechanics .. here , for a correct ( re)evaluation of tihr , it is the place to remember briefly the respective considerations .",
    "firstly it must be noted that the eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) were introduced by using the wave characteristics of quantum microparticles .",
    "consequently the quantum measurements were regarded by similitude with the optical ones .",
    "but in the mentioned years the performances of the optical measurements were restricted by the classical limitative criteria of resolution ( due to abbe and rayleigh ) . then tihr promoted as starting consideration the following point :    @xmath75 : the estimation of performances respectively of uncertainties for the quantum measurements must be done by using the alluded limitative criteria , transposed in quantum framework through de broglie formula @xmath76 ( @xmath77 = wave lenght).@xmath2    by means of this consideration tihr partisans obtained some relations similar with eqs . (",
    "2.1 ) , for all the thought - experiments promoted by them .",
    "referring to the eqs .",
    "( 2.2)-(2.3 ) the starting considerations promoted by tihr can be resumed as follows .",
    "the state of a quantum microparticle is described by the wave function @xmath78 regarded as a vector in a hilbert space ( q denotes the set of specific orbital variables ) . in the respective vectorial space the scalar product ( @xmath79 of two functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 is given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83=the complex conjugate of @xmath80 , whereas @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the accessible respectively infinitesimal domains in q - space . @xmath44",
    "quantum variable @xmath44 is described by the operator @xmath35 and its expected ( mean ) value @xmath86 is defined by    @xmath87    the quantity @xmath88 from eqs .",
    "( 2.2)-(2.3 ) is defined as follows :    @xmath89 @xmath90 then for two variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 the following evident relation was appealed    @xmath91    with @xmath92 an arbitrary and real parameter . in the tihr literature",
    "this relation is transcribed into the formula    @xmath93    which is equivalent with the relation    @xmath94 _ { -}\\right\\rangle _ \\psi + \\left ( \\delta _ \\psi b\\right ) ^2\\geq 0   \\eqnum{4.6}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 _ { -}=\\widehat{a}\\widehat{b}-% \\widehat{b}\\widehat{a}$ ] is the commutator of the operators @xmath35 and @xmath95 as eq .",
    "( 4.6 ) is satisfied for any value of @xmath92 it directly results .",

    "( 2.3 ) .",
    "now we point out here the following notable facts .",
    "the above mentioned starting considerations were founded on old scientific achievements .",
    "for all that , they are preserved and promoted in an unchanged form even in today 's literature ( especially in textbooks ) .",
    "for an up - to - date re - evaluation of tihr the above mentioned starting considerations must be supplemented with elements regarding some ulterior scientific achievements .",
    "the respective elements were reported in the decades after the debut of quantum mechanics but , surprisingly , even today they seem to have little popularity .",
    "our alluded supplement regards the following things .",
    "firstly let us refer to the thought - experimental eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) and , correspondingly , to the limitative criteria involved in the starting consideration mentioned in @xmath98*. * in the last decades , in optical measurements , some super - resolution techniques have been achieved ( roychoudhuri , 1978 ; scheer _ et .",
    "al . _ , 1989 ; croca _ et al_. , 1996 ) .",
    "the performances of the respective techniques overstep the alluded limitative criteria .",
    "then it seems to be possible that instead of @xmath99 one should operate with the following up - to - date consideration :    @xmath100 : the accuracies and uncertainties of the quantum measurements can be estimated by transposition in adequate terms ( by means of de broglie formula @xmath76)of the mentioned super - resolution performances.@xmath2    based on this consideration , it is easy to imagine some *  s*uper-*r*esolution * t*hought * e*xperiments ( srte ) . then for the measurement of two variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 the corresponding uncertainties are @xmath101 and @xmath102 by rationating similarly as in the case of eq .",

    "( 2.2)-(2.3 ) or ( 4.8 ) .",

    "but here we shall consider only a few of the respective relations which are of direct significance for the questions approached in this paper .",
    "then we consider a quantum microparticle for which the orbital state and variables are described by the wave function @xmath105 respectively by the operators @xmath106 with the same significance of notations as in eqs .",

    "the answer to the mentioned questions is affirmative and it regards macroscopic systems studied in both classical and quantum statistical physics .",
    "here we shall illustrate the respective answer by taking over some ideas from our earlier works ( dumitru , 1974a , 1977 , 1988 , 1993 ) .",
    "firstly let us refer to a macroscopic system , consisting of a large number of microparticles , considered in a thermodynamic equilibrium state . in the framework of classical ( nonquantum ) statistical physics such a system can be approached in terms of : ( a ) phenomenological ( quasithermodynamic ) fluctuations theory respectively ( b ) classical statistical mechanics . in the mentioned approaches the state of the system",
    "is described ( landau and lifchitz , 1984 ; zubarev , 1971 ; ruppeiner , 1995 ) by the distribution function @xmath145 .",
    "the variable @xmath146 denotes in the two cases : ( a ) the set of independent macroscopic variables of the system as a whole , respectively ( b ) the phase space coordinates of the microparticles constituting the system . in both cases a specific variable @xmath44 characterizing",
    "the system is a real stochastic ( random ) quantity with a continuous spectrum of values which depends on @xmath146 , i.e. @xmath147 . the mean ( or expected ) value of @xmath148 is given by    @xmath149    where @xmath150 and @xmath151 denote the accessible respectively infiniesimal domains in the @xmath146-space .",
    "then , in the case of such a macroscopic system , for a set @xmath152 of specific variables , the _ thermal fluctuations",
    "_ are described by the correlations @xmath153 , dispersions @xmath154 and standard deviations @xmath155 given by    @xmath156 @xmath157 by relations similar to eqs.(5.3)-(5.5 ) it is easy to see that the correlations @xmath158 are the elements of a non - negative real matrix . then similarly with eq .

    "some examples of such relations are given below in sec .",
    "k. ( see also dumitru , 1974a , 1988 , 1993 ) .    one observes that eqs .",
    "( 5.23 ) and ( 5.21 ) are the macroscopic similars of microscopic hr and of their generalizations defined by eqs .",
    "( 2.3)/(4.8)/(5.13 ) respectively ( 5.6 ) . here",
    "it must be noted that there are also other macroscopic similars of hr , namely relations from the framework of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "such relations can be obtained as follows : the state respectively the specific variables of a macroscopic system in the mentioned framework are described by the statistical operator ( density matrix ) @xmath162 respectively by the operators @xmath163 with the expected values defined as @xmath164 the macroscopic correlations @xmath165 dispersions @xmath166 and standard deviations @xmath167 are given by    @xmath168 @xmath169 in sufficiently general circumstances ( among them the most important being some conditions similar with eq.(5.8 ) ) the quantities from eqs.(5.24 ) satisfy the relations    @xmath170 \\geq 0   \\eqnum{5.25}\\ ] ]    @xmath171    @xmath172    with @xmath173 , @xmath174 . from eq.(5.27 ) one obtains also the following truncated ( less restrictive ) relations    @xmath175 _ { + } \\right\\rangle _ \\rho   \\eqnum{5.28$_{cr}$}\\ ] ]    @xmath176 _ { -}\\right\\rangle _",
    "\\rho \\right|   \\eqnum{5.29 $ _ { cr}$}\\ ] ]    the latter relation is exactly a macroscopic similar of hr defined by eqs . ( 2.3)/(4.8)/(5.13 ) .",
    "the above discussed relations are unitemporal in the sense that the implied probabilistic parameters ( correlations , dispersions , standard deviations ) of the stochastic variables @xmath177 are considered for the same moment of time .",
    "but it easy to see that similar relations can be written if the mentioned parameters are taken into account for different time moments .",
    "so , if the orbital quantum state of a microparticle is described by the time t dependent wave function @xmath178 , instead of unitemporal eq .",
    "( 5.14 ) one can write the following bitemporal relation :    @xmath179    where @xmath180 and @xmath181 with @xmath182 .    another well - known way of introducing the theoretical hr for orbital variables is based on fourier analysis as follows . let be @xmath183 a continuous and quadratically integrable function in the range @xmath184",

    "consequently the mean ( expected ) values of functions like @xmath148 or @xmath191 are given by @xmath192 @xmath193 with the above mentioned elements one can demonstrate ( de bruijn , 1967 ) the following relation @xmath194 with _ a _ and _ b _ as two arbitrary constants .",

    "all the respective relations refer to variables with stochastic characteristics . also , by their mathematical significances , they belong to the same family of similar formulae which can be called _ correlation relations _ ( cr ) .",

    "that is why our approach aims not at a precisely motivated order of exposition .",
    "we mostly wish to show that taken together the set of the alluded defects irrefutably incriminate all the main elements of tihr reviewed in sec .",

    "( 2.1 ) does not justify the mentioned term for one of the implied quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 so @xmath220 ( in the coordinate q -momentum p case ) and @xmath221 ( in the time t - energy e case ) represent the jumps of the respective variable from an initial value ( before the measurements ) to a final value ( after the measurements )",
    ". then it results that @xmath222 and @xmath221 can not be regarded as uncertainties ( i.e. measuring parameters ) with respect to the measured state which is the initial one .",
    "this because ( albertson , 1963 ) :  it seems essential to the notion of a measurements that it answer a question about the given situation existing before measurement .",
    "whether the measurement leaves the measured system unchanged or brings about a new and different state of that system is a second and independent question  .",
    "the remaining quantities @xmath223 and @xmath224 from eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) are also in the situation of infringing the term  measuring uncertainties  in the sense attributed by tihr .",
    "the respective situation is generated by the same facts which will be presented below in the sec .",
    "as regards the theoretical quantity @xmath88 the following observations must be taken into account .",
    "@xmath88 depends only on the theoretical model ( wave function @xmath225 of the considered microparticle but not on the characteristics of the measurements on the respective microparticle .",
    "particularly note that the value of @xmath226 can be modified only by changing the microparticle state ( i.e. its wave function @xmath32 comparatively the measuring uncertainties can be modified by improving ( or worsening ) the performances of the experimental techniques , even if the state of the measured microparticle remains unchanged .    in connection with the term  uncertainty  it is here the place to point out also the following remarks . in quantum mechanics",
    "a variable @xmath44 is described by an adequate operator @xmath35 which ( gudder , 1979 ) is a generalized stochastic ( or random ) quantity .",
    "the probabilistic ( stochastic ) characteristics of the considered microparticle are incorporated in its wave function @xmath227 then the expected value @xmath228 and the standard deviation @xmath88 appears as quantities which are exclusively of intrinsic nature for the respective microparticle .",

    "from the mentioned data one obtains the out - mean @xmath229 and out - deviation @xmath230 .",

    "_ one can see that such a non - quantum relation is also eq .",
    "( 5.23 ) .      as it was shown in sec .",

    "in such a reference , by means of  thought motivations  , the results ( ideas ) from known real experiments were transplanted in a new context .",
    "but such a transplantation seems to be inadequate for a true scientific acceptance , mainly if the new context is practically and conceptually different from the old one .",
    "also it is known that the alluded acceptance must be founded only on two pieces of resistance : ( a ) concrete data from the real and specially designed experiments , and ( b ) correct rigorous mathematical ( logical ) reasonings .",
    "one must add another less known observation about the nature of the experiments referred by tihr .",
    "practically all the respective experiments are of  thought-type and ( jammer , 1974 , p.81 ) there are not known any real experiments capable of attesting ( verifying ) the tihr with a convincing accuracy .",
    "the above presented facts reveal the uselessness respectively the incorrectness of the main elements @xmath26 and @xmath73 of tihr .",

    "one observes now directly that the existence of the respective srte relation incriminates the assertion @xmath238 of tihr .",
    "such an incrimination must be reported also as a defect of tihr .      among the main supports of tihr we find the theoretical eqs .",

    "( 5.7 ) and ( 5.14 ) .",
    "the mentioned incompleteness seems to be regarded as entirely unnatural by the tihr partisans - e.g. when they consider the case of the variables angular momentum @xmath239 and azimuthal angle @xmath213 ( see also below sec .",
    "so , instead of the failing eqs .",
    "( 2.1)/(4.8 ) , in order to preserve at any price the elements like @xmath68 and @xmath240 , the respective partisans use a strange lot of unnaturally  adjusted  relations .",

    "( 5.7)/(5.14 ) or , equivalently , to eq .",
    "of course that in the discussed case the respective equations degenerate into trivial equality 0=0 which is evidently in contradiction with the elements @xmath68 and @xmath240 of tihr .",
    "then one finds that one way or another tihr is incompatible with the absolute accuracy of the referred theoretical equations : this fact constitutes a notable defect of tihr      by @xmath241 tihr states that in a measurement for a solitary variable the quantity @xmath50 can be taken as unlimitedly small .",
    "but if @xmath52 is identified with @xmath88 the respective quantity has a precisely defined value ( dependent on the wave function @xmath105 describing the state of the considered microparticle ) which can not be diminished in a measurement .",
    "then it results that @xmath241 are incorrect .",
    "the respective results points another defect of tihr .      the main idea of tihr about the commutable variables",

    "consequently it was expected to have the following ordinary @xmath262 theoretical hr    @xmath264    also one knows attempts ( kompaneyets , 1966 ) for introducing a thought - experimental @xmath262 relation of the form    @xmath265    which is similar with the @xmath266 version of eq .",

    "secondly , for the @xmath262 case the inapplicability of tihr in its usual form ( presented in sec .",

    "such remarks were signaled in a lot of debating works ( judge , 1963 ; judge and lewis , 1963 ; judge , 1964 ; bouten _ et al _ , 1965 ; evett and mahmoud , 1965 ; krauss , 1965 , 1968 ; carruthers and nietto , 1968 ; levy - leblond , 1976 ; harris and strauss , 1978 ; hasse , 1980 ; holevo , 1981 ; yamada , 1982 ; galitski _ et al . , _ 1985 ) .",

    "but , as it is known , tihr generated also disputes about the topics which are adjacent or additional with respect to the alluded problems .",
    "several such topics will be briefly approached in next sections .",
    "as it was mentioned in sec . ii the story of hr started with the primary questions regarding the measuring uncertainties . during the years the respective questions and",
    "more generally the description of the measurements generated a large number of studies ( a good list of references , in this sense , can be obtained from the works : yanase et al . , 1978 ; braginsky and khalili 1992 ; bush et .",
    "al . , 1996 ; hay and peres , 1998 ;",
    "sturzu , 1999 and surely from the bibliographical publications indicated in the end of sec .",
    "it is surprising to see that many of the above alluded studies are contaminated one way or another by ideas pertaining to the tihr doctrine .",
    "after the above exposed argumentation against tihr , here we wish to present a few elements of a somewhat new reconsideration of the problems regarding the description of measurements ( including of measuring uncertainties ) .",
    "we think that , even modestly limited , such a reconsideration can be of non - trivial interest for our days'science .",
    "this because we agree with the opinion ( primas and mller - herold , 1978 ) that , in fact , ",
    "there exists not yet a fundamental theory of actual measuring instruments  .",
    "firstly , we note that , in our opinion , the questions @xmath510 are of real significance for the studies of the physical systems .",
    "this fact is due to the essential role of measurements ( i.e. of quantitatively evaluated experiments ) for the mentioned studies .",
    "moreover , we think that , in principle , the alluded role appears both in quantum and non - quantum physics .    then in our announced reconsideration we must try to search for natural answer to the questions .. @xmath510 as well as to some other ( more or less ) directly connected problems .",
    "for such a purpose we shall note the remarks under the following points :    : as a rule , all the measurements , both from macroscopic and microscopic physics , are confronted with measuring uncertainties.@xmath2    : the respective uncertainties are generated by various factors . among such factors",
    "the most important ones seem to be the intrinsic fluctuations within the experimental devices and the measuring perturbations ( due to the interactions of the respective devices with the measured systems).@xmath2    : a quantitative description of the measuring uncertainties must be made in the framework of an authentic theory of measurements",
    ". the respective theory must be independent and additional with respect to the traditional chapters of physics ( which describe the intrinsic properties of physical systems).@xmath2    : the measurement of a stochastic variable should not be reduced to a sole detection .",
    "it must be regarded and managed as a _ statistical sampling _ ( i.e. as a statistical ensemble of detections ) .",
    "therefore , for such a variable , the finding of a single value from a sole detection does not mean the collapse of the corresponding stochastic characteristics ( described by a wave function or by a probability density).@xmath8    : in the spirit of the above remark the measuring uncertainties of stochastic variables must be described in terms of quantities connected with the afferent statistical sampling but not with solitary detections.@xmath2    : as regards the above alluded theory of measurements we agree with the idea ( bunge , 1977b ) that it must include some specific elements , but not only generic - universal aspects .",
    "this because every experimental apparatus , used in real measurements , has a well - defined level of performance and a restricted class of utilizations - i.e. it is not a generic - universal ( for all - purpose ) device.@xmath2    : togheter with the mentioned agreement we opine that the measurements theory can include also some elements / ideas with generic - universal characteristics .",
    "one such characteristic is connected with the fact that , in essence , every measurement can be regarded as an acquisition of some information about the measured system.@xmath2    in the spirit of the latter remark we think that from a generic - universal viewpoint a measurement can be described as a process of information transmission , from the measured system to the receiver ( recorder or observer ) . in such a view , the measuring apparatus can be represented as a channel for information transmission , whereas the measuring uncertainties can be pictured as an alteration of the processed information .",
    "such informational approach is applicable for measurements on both macroscopic and microscopic ( quantum ) systems .",
    "also the mentioned approach does not contradict to the idea of specificity as regards the measurements theory .",
    "the respective specificity is implemented in theory by the concrete models / descriptions of the measured system ( information source ) , of the measuring apparatus(transmission channel ) , and of the recorder / observer ( information receiver ) .    for an illustration of the above ideas",
    "let us refer to the description of the measurement of a single stochastic variable @xmath146 having a continuous spectrum of values within the range @xmath511 .",
    "the respective variable can be of classical kind ( such are the macroscopic quantities discussed in connection with eqs .",
    "( 5.19)-(5.23 ) ) or of a quantum nature ( e.g. a cartesian coordinate of a microparticle ) .    the alluded measurement , being regarded as a statistical sampling , its usual task is to find certain global probabilistic parameters of @xmath146 such as : mean / expected value , standard deviation , or even higher order moments .",
    "but the respective parameters are evaluated by means of the elementary probability @xmath512 of finding the value of @xmath146 within the infinitesimal range @xmath513 here @xmath514 denotes the corresponding probability density .",
    "then the mentioned task can be connected directly to @xmath515    related to the measured system 's own properties , @xmath514 has an in ( input ) expression @xmath516.so viewed @xmath517 is assimilable with : ( a ) a usual distribution from classical statistical physics - in the case of a macroscopic system , respectively ( b ) the quantity @xmath518(@xmath196 = the corresponding wave function ) - in the case of a quantum microparticle .",
    "the fact that the measuring apparatus distorts ( alters ) the information about the values of @xmath146 means that the respective apparatus records an out ( output ) probability density @xmath519 which generally differs from @xmath516 .",
    "so , with respect to the measuring process , @xmath516 and @xmath519 describe the input respectively the output information .",
    "then it results that the measuring uncertainties ( alterations of the processed information ) must be described in terms of several quantities depending on both @xmath520 and @xmath521    a description of the mentioned kind can be obtained , for instance , if one uses the following mean values : @xmath522 with @xmath195 = an arbitrary function of @xmath146 .",
    "then a possible quantitative evaluation of the measuring disturbances can be made in terms of both the following parameters :    \\(i ) the _ mean value uncertainty _ given by @xmath523    \\(ii ) the _ standard deviation uncertainty _ defined as @xmath524 where @xmath525 ^{1/2},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,(a = in;out).$ ]    the mentioned evaluation can be enriched by also using the higher order probabilistic moments / correlations ( in the sense discussed by dumitru ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "another evaluation of the measuring uncertainties can be made by means of the _ informational entropy uncertainty _ @xmath526 here the informational entropies @xmath527are defined by @xmath528 dx   \\eqnum{9.5}\\ ] ] where @xmath529 = the unit of the physical variable @xmath530    due to the fact that , in the present considerations , a measurement is regarded as a statistical sampling , the parameters defined by eqs .",
    "( 9.2)-(9.4 ) can be called _ statistical uncertainties . _    the uncertainty parameters introduced by eqs .",
    "( 9.2)-(9.4 ) can be detailed if one takes into account more elements regarding the characteristics of the measuring apparatus and/or of the measured system .",
    "so we can refer to an apparatus modeled as an ( information ) transmission channel with stationary and linear characteristics .. then we can write @xmath531 where the kernel @xmath532 must satisfy the normalization conditions @xmath533 the measurement is ideal or real ( non - ideal ) in the cases when @xmath534 respectively @xmath535 . in the above model",
    "such cases appear if we take @xmath536 respectively @xmath537 , with @xmath538 as dirac @xmath499 function of @xmath539 then by using eqs .",
    "( 9.4)-(9.6 ) and by taking into account the relation @xmath540 one obtains @xmath541 \\geq\\ ] ] @xmath542 = 0   \\eqnum{9.8}\\ ] ] so we find @xmath543 this relation shows that for the processed information ( measurement of @xmath146 ) the _ entropy h _ at the recorder is greater ( or at least equal ) than at the measured system .",
    "in terms of the entropy uncertainty we can speak of ideal respectively real ( non - ideal ) measurement as @xmath544 or @xmath545    we can detail even more the above ideas by the following example .",
    "let us consider @xmath146 as coordinate of a rectilinear quantum oscillator situated in its lowest energy state .",
    "such a state is described by the gaussian wave function @xmath546 where @xmath547 with @xmath305 and @xmath285 denoting the mass respectively the angular frequency of the oscillator .. then @xmath548 is given by @xmath549 the @xmath550 - values ( calculated with @xmath516 ) of mean and standard deviation of @xmath146 are @xmath551 if the errors induced by the measuring device are supposed to be small , the kernel @xmath532 can be taken of the gaussian form : @xmath552 here @xmath553 and @xmath554 denote the _ precision indices _ of the device .",
    "so an ideal , respectively a real measurement correspond to @xmath555 and @xmath556 ( when @xmath557 respectively to @xmath558 and @xmath559 by introducing eqs .",
    "( 9.13 ) in ( 9.6 ) one finds @xmath560 with @xmath561 for the out - expressions ( calculated with @xmath519 ) of the mean value respectively of standard deviation of @xmath146 one obtains @xmath562 @xmath563 then the uncertainties defined by eqs .",

    "( 9.4 ) of the informational entropy regarding @xmath146 one finds @xmath566",
    "now we can extend our discussion for the measurement of the momentum @xmath567 in the case of the same quantum oscillator described by the wave function from eq .",
    "( 9.10 ) . as it is known the respective wave function is given in @xmath146 -representation .",
    "but it can be transcribed in @xmath567-representation in the form : @xmath568 with @xmath569 so all the above considerations can be transcribed from a @xmath146-variable version in a @xmath567-variable form .",
    "then the @xmath550- expressions for the probability distribution respectively for mean value and standard deviation of @xmath567 are @xmath570 @xmath571 @xmath572 if the @xmath567-measuring device is also characterized by small errors it can be described by the kernel @xmath573 with @xmath574 and @xmath575 as precision indices of the device .",
    "similarly with the @xmath146-variable case for the momentum @xmath567 one finds that the distribution @xmath576characterizing the output of the measuring process is given by @xmath577 where @xmath578    then the @xmath579-expression of the mean value and standard deviation for @xmath567 are @xmath580 @xmath581    correspondingly , the uncertainties of the mean value and standard deviation of @xmath567 are @xmath582 @xmath583 also for the uncertainty regarding the informational entropy for the @xmath567 variable one obtains @xmath584    now , the above presented statistical uncertainties for @xmath146 and @xmath567 can be regarded together for a possible comparison with some supposed ideas from the tihr doctrine .",
    "for such a purpose we consider the following products : @xmath585 @xmath586 @xmath587 @xmath588    as we have discussed in sections ii and vi , tihr supposes that the product of the uncertainties for @xmath146 and @xmath567 has a non - null inferior limit .",
    "the respective limit is expressed only in terms of the fundamental constant @xmath63 , and it is completely independent of certain characteristics regarding the measuring device .",
    "comparatively , from eqs .",
    "( 9.34)-(9.36 ) it results that the products of the statistical uncertainties for @xmath146 and @xmath567 are directly dependent on the precision parameters @xmath589 and @xmath575 of the measuring devices . if all the respective parameters are null ( case of ideal measurements ) the mentioned products are also null .",
    "this means that the products of the mentioned statistical uncertainties for @xmath146 and @xmath567 have not a non - null inferior limit .",
    "now note that , in the here - proposed model for describing the measurements , the @xmath146 - and @xmath567 - devices are considered as completely independent . in principle , the respective devices can be coupled in a more complex @xmath146 & @xmath567 - instrument .",
    "a theoretical model for the description of measurements with such an instrument can be obtained only by using a set of adequately justified hypotheses .",
    "in such a model probably that the above presented kernels @xmath532 and @xmath590must be regarded as resulting from a more complex quantity dependent on both pairs @xmath591 and @xmath592 .",
    "but a @xmath593 couplage of the mentioned kind still requires further investigations .",
    "then , probably , the problem of the product of adequate @xmath146-and @xmath567-uncertainties will be also discussed .",
    "in sectionsv , vi , and vii we have argued that the theoretical hr from quantum mechanics given by eqs .",
    "( 2.2)-(2.3 ) have authentic nonquantum analogs . but",
    "the mentioned hr are commonly associated with planck 's constant @xmath594 then there naturally arises the question whether @xmath0 also has an authentic analog in nonquantum physics .",
    "now , in this section we shall present a lot of elements which reveal that the answer to the above question is affirmative . the alluded analog of @xmath0 is shown to be the boltzmann 's constant k. the viewed analogy is given by the fact that @xmath63 and k have similar roles of generic indicators of the onefold stochasticity ( randomness ) for well - specified classes of physical systems ( i.e. for individual quantum microparticles and macroscopic nonquantum systems , respectively ) .",
    "a physical system is considered to have stochastic respectively nonstochastic characteristics depending on the probabilistic nature of its specific variables . for a system",
    ", the level ( degree ) of stochasticity depends on the frame ( approach ) in which it is studied .",
    "so , for a macroscopic system consisting of a large ensemble of molecules , the stochasticity is significant in statistical physics approach but it is completely unimportant in the frame of continuous mechanics or of thermodynamics .. also , in the case of a microparticle of atomic size , the stochastic characteristics are essential from a quantum mechanics view , but they are negligible from a classical mechanics perspective .",
    "of course , the level of stochasticity can be described by means of certain fluctuation quantities such as the ones defined / implied in eqs . ( 4.3 ) , ( 5.4 ) , ( 5.6 ) , ( 5.15 ) , ( 5.20 ) and ( 5.24 ) .",
    "but the respective quantities take particular expressions ( and values ) for diverse variables or various systems .",
    "therefore , they can not be considered as generic indicators of stochasticity , i.e. as parameters indicating generically the stochasticity level for a set or variables or for a whole class of systems .",
    "below we shall show that the roles of such generic indicators of stochasticity are played , in similar ways , by the constants k and @xmath0 for the macroscopic nonquantum systems and individual quantum microparticles , respectively .",
    "firstly , let us discuss the alluded role for k with respect to the macroscopic systems . if such a system is studied in the framework of phenomenological ( quasithermodynamic ) theory of fluctuations ( munster , 1960 , 1969 ; dumitru , 1974a ; landau and lifschitz , 1984 ) , its microscopic - molecular structure is completely neglected . also , its specific variables are global macroscopic quantities regarded as real stochastic variables with continuous spectra of values .",
    "for such a system , in the mentioned approach , the fluctuations of the variables as pressure @xmath595 and volume @xmath245 are described by the quantities @xmath596 and @xmath597 given in eq .",
    "( 6.40 ) . more generally , for the same system we can consider two arbitrary variables @xmath598and @xmath599regarded as functions of certain independent variables",

    "as an example from classical statistical physics we can consider the system referred in connection with the eqs .",
    "( 6.41)-(6.42 ) .",
    "the corresponding stochastic variables are @xmath410 and @xmath605 .",
    "their fluctuations are described by the quantities @xmath606 and @xmath607 whose expressions are given by eqs .",
    "( 6.42 ) .",
    "now we can proceed to a direct examination of the expressions from eqs .",
    "( 6.40 ) , ( 10.1 ) and ( 6.42 ) of the quantities @xmath434 and @xmath608 which describe the thermal fluctuations in macroscopic systems .",
    "one can observe that all the respective expressions are structured as products of k with terms which are independent from k. the alluded independence is ensured by the fact that the mentioned terms are expressed only by means of macroscopic non - stochastic quantities .",
    "( note that the mean values @xmath609 from the respective terms must coincide with deterministic ( i.e. nonstochastic ) quantities from usual thermodynamics ) .",
    "due to the above observed structure , the examined fluctuation quantities are in a direct dependence of k. so they are significant respectively negligible as we take @xmath610 or @xmath611 . because @xmath190 is a constant , the limit @xmath611 must be regarded in the sense that the quantities directly proportional with @xmath190 are negligible comparatively with other terms of the same dimensionality but not containing @xmath612 however , the fluctuations reveal the stochastic characteristics of the physical systems",
    ". then we can conclude that the thermal stochasticity , for the system studied in nonquantum statistical physics , is an important respectively insignificant property as we consider @xmath610 or @xmath613    the mentioned features vis - a - vis the values of @xmath190 are specific for all the macroscopic systems ( e.g. gases , liquids and solids of various inner compositions ) and for all their specific global variables .",
    "but such a remark reveals the fact that @xmath190 has the qualities of an authentic _ generic indicator for thermal stochasticity _ ( i.e. for the stochasticity evidenced through the thermal fluctuations ) .",
    "now let us approach questions connected with the _ quantum stochasticity _ which is specific for the individual , nonrelativistic microparticles of atomic size .",
    "such a kind of stochasticity is revealed by the specific quantum fluctuations of the corresponding variables ( of orbital and spin nature ) .",

    "then , there results that @xmath0 can play the role of generic indicator for quantum stochasticity .",
    "corespondingly , as @xmath614 or @xmath615 the mentioned stochasticity appears as a significant respectively negligible property .",
    "the above mentioned connection between the quantum stochasticity and @xmath0 must be complemented with certain deeper considerations .",
    "such considerations regard ( dumitru and veriest , 1995 ) different behaviour patterns of various physical variables in the limit @xmath615 , usually called * q*uantum _  _ @xmath616*c*lassical _  _ * l*imit ( qcl ) .",

    "we consider an electron whose spin state is described by the function ( spinor ) @xmath131 given by @xmath617   \\eqnum{10.2}\\ ] ] for a specific variable we take the z - component of the spin angular moment @xmath618 ( @xmath619 being the corresponding pauli matrix ) . for the respective variable in the mentioned state we find",
    "@xmath620 the quantity @xmath621 describes the quantum fluctuations of spin kind i.e. the spin quantum stochasticity .",
    "the presence of @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( 10.3 ) show that the respective stochasticity is significant or not as @xmath622 or @xmath615 .",
    "this means that @xmath0 plays the role of generic indicator for the respective stochasticity .",
    "but in the state described by eq .",
    "( 10.2 ) one finds also @xmath623 .",
    "this additional results shows that , in fact , for @xmath615 the variable @xmath624 disappears completely .",
    "then we can note that for spin variables the behaviour pattern in quantum @xmath625classical limit consists of an annulment of both stochastic characteristics and mean values ( i.e. in a complete disappearance ) .",
    "in the case of orbital quantum variables the quantum @xmath616classical limit implies not only the condition @xmath615 but also the requirement that certain quantum numbers grow unboundedly .. the mentioned requirement is due to the fact that certain significant variables connected with the orbital motion ( e.g. the energy ) pass from their quantum values to adequate classical values .",
    "so , with respect to the mentioned limit the orbital variables have two kinds of behaviour patterns .    as an example of the first kind we refer to the coordinate @xmath146 of a harmonic rectilinear oscillator considered in its n - th energy level .",
    "then similarly with @xmath314 from eq .",
    "( 6.19 ) we have : @xmath626 ^{1/2 }   \\eqnum{10.4}\\ ] ] where @xmath627 and @xmath317 denote the mass , the angular frequency respectively the oscillation quantum number . for the mentioned example",
    "the quantum @xmath616classical limit means not only @xmath615 but also @xmath628 .",
    "this because the energy must pass from the quantum expression @xmath629to the corresponding classical expression @xmath630 , where @xmath631 is the coordinate amplitude",
    ". then the standard deviation of @xmath146 passes from the quantum value given by eq .",
    "( 10.4 ) to the classical value @xmath632 but @xmath633 and @xmath634 are fluctuation parameters which describe the stochastic characteristics of @xmath146 in quantum respectively classical contexts",
    ". then one can say that in quantum @xmath616classical limit the above considered coordinate @xmath146 preserves both its role of significant variable and its stochasticity .    as an example of the second kind of orbital variable we consider the distance @xmath635 between the electron and nucleus in a hydrogen atom .",
    "we refer to an electron in a state described by the wave function @xmath636 with @xmath637 ( where @xmath638 and @xmath305 are respectively the principal , orbital and magnetic quantum numbers ) .",
    "then for @xmath639 we can use the expression given by schwabl ( 1995 ) , rewritten in the form @xmath640 with @xmath641 and @xmath642 denoting the mass respectively the change of the electron .",
    "the energy of the electron is @xmath643 the quantum@xmath616classical limit requires that @xmath644 with @xmath645 denoting the classical value of the energy . then from eqs .",
    "( 10.6 ) and ( 10.7 ) it results that in the respective limit we have @xmath646 in the same circumstances we obtain",
    "@xmath647 so it results that in the quantum@xmath616classical limit ( when @xmath648 and @xmath649 ) we have @xmath650 and @xmath651 this means that @xmath635 preserves its role of significant variable but loses its stochasticity .",
    "the above considerations can be concluded with the following remark :    : in the quantum@xmath616classical limit the physical variables display the following different behaviour patterns :    \\(i ) the complete disappearance of both stochastic characteristics and mean values , as in the case of spin variables .",
    "\\(ii ) the preservation of both the role of significant variable and of stochastic characteristics , as in the case of oscillator coordinate    \\(iii ) the preservation of the role of significant variable but the loss of stochastic characteristics as in the case of electron - nucleus distance.@xmath8    it is clear that the above remark corrects the traditional belief of a unique behaviour pattern compulsorily associated with the disappearance of the  uncertainties  ( i.e. of the standard deviations @xmath88 ) .",
    "now let us return to the quantum stochasticity , specific for the variables of individual microparticles .",
    "we think that , in spite of the peculiarities mentioned in @xmath652 , the planck constant @xmath0 can be considered as a generic indicator of such a stochasticity .",
    "moreover , we consider that the respective role of @xmath0 is completely similar with that the boltzmann constant k with respect to the macroscopic thermal stochasticity ( see above ) .",
    "regarding the mentioned roles of @xmath0 and @xmath190 another observation must be added . in the discussed cases ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath190 appear independently and singly .",
    "that is why one can say that the stochasticity of the corresponding systems ( microparticles and classical macroscopic systems ) has a onefold character .",
    "but there are also physical systems endowed with a twofold stochasticity characterized by a simultaneous connection with both @xmath0 and @xmath190 . such systems are those studied in quantum statistical physics , i.e. , the bodies of macroscopic size considered as statistical ensembles of quantum microparticles . the stochasticity of the respective systems is revealed by corresponding fluctuations described by the quantities given by eqs .",
    "( 5.24 ) which depend simultaneously on both @xmath0 and @xmath190 .",
    "the respective dependence is revealed by the so - called fluctuation - dissipation theorem . according to the respective theorem",
    "( kubo 1957 ; zubarev 1971 ; balescu 1975 ) one can write @xmath653 @xmath654 d\\omega   \\eqnum{10.11}\\ ] ] with @xmath655 as complex conjugate of @xmath656    in eq .",
    "( 10.11 ) @xmath657 represent the generalized susceptibilities which appears also in the deterministic framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics ( de groot and mazur , 1962 ) .",
    "but it is a known fact that in the respective framework all the stochastic characteristics of physical variables are neglected and no miscroscopic ( i.e. atomic or molecular ) structure of the systems is taken into account .",
    "another fact is that @xmath657 are directly connected ( landau and lifschitz , 1984 ) with the macroscopic nonstochastic expression of the energy dissipated inside the thermodynamic systems actioned by external deterministic and macroscopic perturbations .",
    "the mentioned facts show that the susceptibilities @xmath657 do not depend on the constants @xmath0 and @xmath612    the above mentioned property of @xmath657 combined with eq .",
    "( 10.11 ) shows that the sole significant dependence of fluctuation quantities given by eq .",
    "( 5.24 ) on the constants @xmath190 and @xmath0 is given by the factor @xmath658 .",
    "for the respective factor one can write @xmath659 \\right\\ } = 0   \\eqnum{10.12}\\ ] ] this means that when both @xmath0 and @xmath190 tend to zero the fluctuation quantities defined by eq .",
    "( 5.24 ) become null .",
    "so it results that in the mentioned limit the fluctuations in quantum statistical systems cease to manifest themselves .",
    "consequently , for such a limit the respective systems lose their stochastic characteristics . then in the spirit of the above presented opinions one can state that quantum statistical systems can be considered as endowed with a twofold stochasticity of the thermal and quantum type , revealed respectively by @xmath190 and @xmath0 as generic indicators .    in the above considerations the stochasticity appears as a property of exclusively intrinsic type",
    "this means that it is connected only with the internal ( inner ) characteristics of the considered systems and does not depend on external ( outside ) factors .",
    "moreover the mentioned stochasticity is directly and strongly associated with @xmath0 and @xmath190 as generic indicators .",
    "but the stochasticity can be also of extrinsic type .",
    "in such cases it is essentially connected with factors from the outside ( surroundings ) of the considered physical systems .",
    "also the extrinsic stochasticity is not ( necessarily ) associated with @xmath0 and @xmath612 as examples of system with stochasticity of exclusively extrinsic type can be considered an empty bottle floating on a stormy sea or a die in a game .    in practice",
    "one finds also systems endowed with stochasticity of both the intrinsic and extrinsic types .",
    "such are for example , the electric and electronic circuits . for a circuit",
    "the intrinsic stochasticity is caused by the thermal agitation of the charge carries and/or of elementary ( electric or magnetic ) dipoles inside of its constitutive elements ( i.e. inside of resistors , inductances , condensers , transistors , integrated circuits , etc . ) .",
    "the respective agitation is responsible for fluctuations of macroscopic voltages and currents .",
    "such fluctuations are known ( robinson , 1974 ) as thermal ( or nyquist ) noises .",
    "note that in the case of circuits the intrinsic stochasticity is characterized by generic indicators .",
    "such indicators are @xmath190 alone , if the circuit is considered as a classical ( nonquantum ) statistical system , and @xmath190 together with @xmath0 when the circuit is viewed as a quantum statistical system .",
    "otherwise , the stochasticity of a circuit can also be of extrinsic type when it is under the influence of a large variety of factors .",
    "such factors can be : thermal fluctuations in the surrounding medium , accidental outside discharges and inductions , atmospheric ( or even cosmic ) electrical phenomena .",
    "the mentioned extrinsic stochasticity is also responsible for the noises in macroscopic currents and voltages in the circuits .",
    "but it must be noted that even for circuits , the extrinsic stochasticity is not connected in principle with generic indicators dependent on fundamental physical constants ( such as @xmath0 and @xmath190 ) . as an interesting case which implies stochasticity of both intrinsic and extrinsic type",
    "can be considered a measuring process viewed as in sec .",
    "in such a case the intrinsic stochasticity regards the inner properties of the measured system while the extrinsic one is due to the measuring apparatus .",
    "the corresponding intrinsic stochasticity is connected with @xmath63 and @xmath190 as generic indicators in the above discussed sense .",
    "however , the extrinsic stochasticity , due to the apparatus , seems to be not connected with certain generic indicators .",
    "this because of the large diversity of apparata as regards their own structure and accuracy .",
    "with respect to problematics of hr proper , in literature ( see the bibliographical publications mentioned in the end of sec .",
    "i ) one knows of a large variety of adjacent questions which , one way or another , are allied with the subjects discussed in the previous sections of this paper .",
    "now , we wish to note a few remarks on several such questions .",
    "@xmath508 firstly , let us refer to the consequences of the here - proposed reconsideration of hr for both lucrative procedures and interpretational frame of quantum mechanics .",
    "note that our reconsideration does not prejudice in any way the authentic version of the mentioned lucrative procedures , which , in fact , have met with unquestionable successes in both basic and aplicative researches . as regards the alluded interpretational frame , our reconsideration , mainly by the abandonment of tihr , generates major and important changes . but such changes must be regarded as benefic , since they can offer a genuine elucidation to the controversial questions introduced in the frame of science by tihr.@xmath660    @xmath508 by reinterpreting hr in the sense presented in sec.viii the respective relations lose their quality of crucial physical formulae .",
    "so , one can find a consonance with the prediction ( dirac , 1963 ) :  i think one can make a safe guess that uncertainty relations in their present form will not survive in the physics of future  .",
    "note that the above prediction was founded not on some considerations about the essence of hr but on a supposition about the future role of @xmath0 in physics .",
    "so it was supposed that @xmath0 will be a derived quantity while @xmath661 and @xmath642 ( speed of light and elementary charge ) will remain as fundamental constants .",
    "that is why we wish to add here that our view about hr does not affect the actual position of @xmath0 as a physical constant .",
    "more precisely , our findings can not answer the question whether @xmath0 will be a fundamental constant or a derived quantity ( e.g. expressed in terms of @xmath661 and @xmath642).@xmath662    @xmath508 as it was pointed in sec.x the planck s constant @xmath663 has also the significance of estimator for the spin of microparticles ( like the electron ) .",
    "so the spin appears to be a notable respectively absent property as @xmath614 or @xmath615 . on the other hand with the reference to the spin",
    "there are also some intriguing questions related to its relativistic justification . usually ( dirac , 1958 ; blochintsev,1981 ) for electrons the spin is regarded to be essentially explicable as consequence of relativistic theory .",
    "but , as it is known , the relativistic characteristics of a particle are evidenced by the relative value @xmath664 of its velocity @xmath665 comparatively with the light velocity @xmath661 .",
    "particularly , the respective characteristics must be insignificant when @xmath666 or @xmath667 .",
    "then the absence of the factor @xmath664 ( or of some other equivalent factors ) in the description of the electron spin variable appears at least as intriguing fact .",
    "is such a fact a sufficient reason to consider @xmath0 as a derived quantity in the sense guessed by dirac ( 1963 ) .",
    "in such a sense @xmath668 ( @xmath669= the permittivity of vacuum and @xmath670 = the fine structure constant ) and the situations with @xmath615 appear when @xmath667 .",
    "so the significance of @xmath0 as spin estimator can be apparently related with some aspects of relativity .",
    "but here it must be noted the surprising fact that even in the nonrelativistic limit ( i.e. when @xmath671 or @xmath672 ) the spin remains a significant variable of the electron .",
    "it is known ( ivanov , 1989 ) that the electron spin plays a decisive role ( as a fourth quantum variable / number ) in the electronic configuration of many - electronic atoms , in spite of the fact that for atomic electrons @xmath666 . due to the here mentioned features we think that the relativistic justification of the spin appears as a intriguing question witch requires further investigations.@xmath662    @xmath508 our findings facilitate also a remark in connection with another supposition about @xmath0 .",
    "the respective supposition regards the possible existence of multiple planck constants associated with various kinds of microparticles ( e.g. with electrons , protons , neutrons ) .",
    "currently , ( whichman , 1971 ; fischbach _ et .",
    "1991 ) , the tendency is to contest such a possibility and to promote the idea of a unique planck constant . for this",
    "one appeals either to experimental data or to some connection with the fundamental conservation laws .",
    "we think that our view about @xmath0 pleads somewhat for the alluded idea of uniqueness ..",
    "so , regarding @xmath0 as generic indicator of quantum stochasticity , this one must have the same value for various kinds of microparticles .",
    "this because , similarly , the boltzman constant @xmath190 in its role of generic indicator for thermal stochasticity has a unique value for various kinds of macroscopic systems ( e.g. hydrogen gas , liquid water or crystallin germanium ) .",
    "@xmath508 the revealed stochastic similarity among quantum microparticles and macroscopic systems facilitates another remark . in the macroscopic case the stochastic characteristics for _ an individual system _ is incorporated in the probability distribution @xmath673 ( see sections v and vi .",
    "as we have shown , the quantum similar of @xmath674 is the wave function @xmath105 ( or the square @xmath675 of its module ) .",
    "such a @xmath676 similarity motivates us to agree the idea ( van kampen 1978 ) that @xmath677 refer to a single system ( microparticle ) .",
    "simultaneously , we incline to a circumspect regard about the opinions that @xmath105 belongs to an  ensemble of equally prepared systems ",
    "( tschudi , 1987 ) or to an  abstract physical object  ( mayants,1984 ) .",
    "moreover , our agreement and opinion are also motivated by the observation that in practical applications both @xmath105 and @xmath673 are calculated for individual systems ( e.g. for an electron in a hydrogen atom or , respectively for an ideal gas).@xmath662    @xmath508a distinct group of remarks regards the reduction of stochasticity to subjacent elements of deterministic nature , for both cases of thermodynamic systems and quantum microparticles . in the first case the stochasticity refers to the macroscopic variables which characterize each system as a whole . but according to the classical statistical mechanics the respective variables are expressible in terms of subjacent molecular quantities ( coordinates and momenta ) which are considered as deterministic elements . in the case of quantum microparticles",
    "a similar problem was taken into account .",
    "so it was promoted the idea that the stochastic quantum variables ( characterizing each microparticle as a whole ) would be expressible in terms of some sujacent elements of deterministic nature , called  hidden variables  .",
    "viewing comparatively the two mentione d cases we think that is of nontrivial interest ti note the foolowing observations :    \\(i ) in the case of thermodynamic systems the subjacent molecular quantities can be justfied in essence only by adequate experimental facts .",
    "\\(ii ) the mentioned molecular quantities are deterministic ( i. e. depresionfree ) only from a microscopic perspective , connected with the characteristics of the molecules . from a macroscopic perspective , coonected with a thermodynamic systems as a whole , they are stochastic variables .",
    "that is why , for example , in respect with a thermodynamic system like an ideal gas one speaks about the mean value and non - null dispersion of the molecular velocity .",
    "\\(iii ) even by taking into account the existence of sujacent molecular quantities the macroscopic variables , characterizing a thermodynamic system as a whole , keep their stochastic characteristics .",
    "particularly the mentioned existence does not influence the verity or the significance of the macroscopic relations frim the family of eqs .",
    "( 5.21 ) - ( 5.23 ) .",
    "\\(iv ) the above observations ( i ) - ( iii ) reveal as unfounded the idea ( uffink and van lith 1999 ) that the sole examination of some theoretical formulas , from the mentioned family , can give a light on the problem of reduction of thermodynamic stochasticity to subjacend deterministic elements .",
    "\\(v ) by analogy with the fact noted in ( i ) , in the case of quantum microparticles , the existence of the  hidden variables  must be proved firstly by indubitable experimental facts .",
    "but , as far as we know , until now such an experimental proof was not ratified by scientific research .",
    "\\(vi ) the existence of the mentioned  hidden variables  can not be asserted only by means of considerations on some theoretical formulas regarding the global stochasticity of quantum microparticles , such are the hr .",
    "\\(vii ) the global description of a quantum microparticle remain equally probabilistic in both cases , with or without  hidden variables  . more exactly in both casses for a variable refering to a quantum microparticle as a whole the theoretical predictions must be done in probabilistic terms while the experimental informations can be obtained only from measurements consisting in statistical samplings .    @xmath508 the discussions from sec .",
    "x about the stochasticity suggest a remark connected with the boltzmann 's constant @xmath190 .",
    "as we have shown @xmath190 plays a major role in the evaluation of the level of the thermal stochasticity .",
    "but the respective stochasticity must be regarded as an important property of the macroscopic systems .",
    "so one finds as unfounded the idea , promoted in some publications ( wichman , 1971 ; landau and lifschitz , 1984 ; storm , 1986 ) that , in physics @xmath190 has only a minor role of conversion factor between temperature scales ( from energetic units into kelvin degrees).@xmath662",
    "we started the paper reminding the fact that even in our days tihr persists as a source of unelucidated controversies about it defects . motivated by the respective fact we proposed an investigation in the very core of the alluded controversies and defects .",
    "for such a purpose firstly we identified the main elements ( assertions and arguments ) of tihr .",
    "then , in reference with the mentioned elements , we localized the most known and critical defects of tihr .",
    "in such a reference frame we analyzed the reality of the respective defects .",
    "we found that all of them are veridical .",
    "moreover , for tihr , they are insurmountable and incriminate each of its main elements .",
    "so we can conclude that the sole reasonable attitude is to abandon tihr as an unjustified doctrine .",
    "the mentioned abandonment must be accompanied with a search for a new and genuine reinterpretation of hr . on this direction",
    "we opine that hr of troughs - experimental nature must be disregarded because they are fictitious formulae without a true physical significance .",
    "on the other hand we think that the theoretical hr are authentic physical formulae regarding the quantum fluctuations .",
    "so regarded the theoretical hr belong to a large class of formulae specific for systems , of both quantum and non - quantum nature , endowed with stochastic characteristics . by adopting the mentioned regards about hr all the controversies connected with the tihr",
    "are elucidated on a natural way .    in the mentioned regard",
    "hr lose their traditional role of crucial physical formulae connected with the description of measurement characteristics ( uncertainties ) . in the here promoted view",
    "the respective description must be done in terms ( and formulae ) which do not belong to the traditional chapter of physics ( including the quantum mechanics ) . we suggested that a promising version for the description of measurements can be done in terms of information theory .",
    "so a measurement can be considered as an information transmission , from the measured system ( information source ) through the measuring device ( transmission channel ) to the device recorder ( information receiver ) .",
    "then the measuring uncertainties appear as alternations of processed information . in the sec .",
    "ix we illustrated the alluded informational model with some concrete considerations .    in our opinion the theoretical hr and their classical ( non - quantum ) similars are connected with the stochasticity regarded as an important property of physical systems .",
    "we showed that the respective property is characterized by generic indicators which are :    \\(i ) the planck s constant @xmath0 ( for quantum microparticles ) ,    \\(ii ) the boltzmann s constant @xmath190 ( for classical thermodynamical system ) , respectively    \\(iii ) both @xmath0 and @xmath190 ( for quantum statistical systems ) .    in the end , in sec .",
    "xi , we presented remarks on some questions which are adjacent with the subjects discussed in the other parts of the paper .",
