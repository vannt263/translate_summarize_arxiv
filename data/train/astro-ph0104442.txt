    "40004000  = 1000              it has long been recognized that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is highly ionized , and likely contains a substantial fraction of the universe s baryons at redshifts @xmath6 ( e.g. gunn & peterson 1965 , steidel & sargent 1987 , fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "constraints on the baryon density @xmath5 ( where @xmath7 is a fraction of the critical density , and @xmath8 is the hubble constant today in units of @xmath9 km / s / mpc ) from observations of the lyman-@xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) forest rely on assumptions about the size and geometry of the absorbing structures ( see e.g. rauch & haehnelt 1995 ) .",
    "recent advance in theoretical modeling of the forest provides a framework in which fluctuations seen in absorption arise naturally out of gravitational instability , and which successfully matches the gross observed properties of the forest ( e.g. ; but see also meiksin , bryan & machacek 2001 for possible problems , and zaldarriaga et al .",
    "2001 for consistency checks ) .",
    "this framework makes definite predictions about the spatial distribution of the absorbing structures , making it possible to obtain useful constraints on @xmath5 from forest observations ( e.g. )  once the photoionizing background , which determines the overall neutral fraction , is specified .",
    "three recent developments motivate us to re - examine the ly@xmath0 forest constraints on the cosmological baryon fraction .",
    "first , the recent microwave background anisotropy measurements favor a baryon fraction that is higher than the big bang nucleosynthesis value inferred from deuterium measurements ( the former gives @xmath10 , 2-@xmath11 limits for a flat scale - invariant inflation model , see ; the latter gives @xmath12 , 1-@xmath11 error , see burles , nollet & turner 2000 ; see also burles & tytler 1998 for earlier constraints ) .",
    "second , steidel , pettini & adelberger ( 2001 ) reported measurements of a large escape fraction of ionizing photons from lyman break galaxies ( lbg s ) at @xmath13 , which imply an extragalactic ionizing flux that is significantly larger than what one might expect from quasars alone .",
    "a larger photo - ionizing background implies a smaller neutral fraction , and so a larger baryon density is required to match the given observed mean absorption seen in the forest .",
    "lastly , analysis of the ly@xmath0 forest has moved beyond comparisons with a restricted set of cosmological models to a point where several parameters specifying the mass power spectrum and the thermal state of the igm can be determined at the same time from the data ( e.g. choudhury , srianand & padmanabhan 2000 , zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark 2000 ) .",
    "since earlier forest constraints on the baryon fraction focused on fixed cosmological models and/or reionization history ( and therefore fixed thermal state ) , it is timely to examine how uncertainties in these parameters impact the estimates for @xmath5 .",
    "because the ly@xmath0 constraint on the baryon fraction is completely independent of constraints from nucleosynthesis or the microwave background , comparing all three provides a powerful consistency check of the inflation @xmath14 cold dark matter structure formation model , as well as a test of current ideas about the nature of the forest .",
    "we briefly review in  [ model ] the gravitational instability model for the ly@xmath0 forest , and how it is used to obtain estimates of the baryon density .",
    "discussions in the literature have focused on two different approaches .",
    "one ( e.g. haehnelt et al .",
    "2000 ) implicitly assumes that most of the universe s baryons is in the igm , and that the total ionizing background can be largely accounted for by directly summing up the contributions from known sources , or obtained from indirect measurements of the sum total background , such as those using the proximity effect .",
    "the other approach ( e.g. rauch et al .",
    "1997 ; weinberg et al .",
    "1997 ) is more conservative , assuming only a lower limit to the ionizing background from known sources  this gives a lower bound on the neutral fraction and therefore a lower bound for the @xmath5 .",
    "we will discuss both approaches .",
    "we describe in  [ lowerbound ] how lower bounds given in the literature can be interpreted in a statistical manner , generalizing earlier work where only strict lower bounds are discussed .",
    "as we will see , uncertainties in the level of the ionizing background dominate uncertainties in the current bound on @xmath5 . in  [ further ] , we relate the lower - bound likelihood in  [ lowerbound ] to the ( differential ) likelihood for baryon density , assuming effectively that most of the universe s baryons are in the igm and that the ionization background is known .",
    "as we will emphasize in  [ further ] , non - negligible uncertainties in the estimates for @xmath5 remain _ even if _ the ionizing background is known to high accuracy .",
    "this is because of degeneracy with other parameters in the gravitational instability model .",
    "we will examine which parameters are the most important in this regard .",
    "the likelihood of @xmath5 for a fixed ionizing background is also given ( an explicit expression is also presented in  [ discuss ] ) , which can be used to compute future likelihoods as measurements of the ionizing background improve .",
    "some of the conclusions in the above sections depend critically on the ionizing flux inferred from observations of lyman break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "the fraction of hydrogen  ionizing photons that escape from these galaxies is significantly higher than what is observed in local galaxies , and what is naively expected in simple theoretical models . in ",
    "[ lbo ] , we investigate the type of cold gas distribution that would allow these early galaxies to have a high escape probability for ionizing photons .",
    "finally , we conclude in  [ discuss ] , where the issue of escape fraction from quasars is also discussed .",
    "some of the issues in this paper have been addressed in two recent works .",
    "haehnelt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) used previous bounds to derive new limits on @xmath15 , using the steidel et al .",
    "measurement of the escape fraction  the treatment assumed the same cosmological model and reionization history upon which the previous respective bounds were based .",
    "they also briefly discussed the significance the steidel et al .",
    "results in the context of population synthesis model spectra , and the escape fraction expected based on the amount of gas inferred from the star",
    " formation rate .",
    "choudhury , srianand & padmanabhan ( 2001 ) used the lognormal approximation to derive bounds on the ratio of @xmath16 to the ionizing flux , where the thermal state of the gas is allowed to vary , for a fixed cosmological model . here",
    ", we examine the @xmath5 constraints using n - body simulations for a suite of cosmological models ( i.e. varying power spectrum ) and thermal histories .",
    "we also consider the implication of the high observed escape fraction for the age , structure and stellar content of lyman - break galaxies in greater detail .",
    "we describe briefly here the ly@xmath0 forest model used in this paper .",
    "it is largely motivated by the success of numerical simulations in matching the observed properties of quasar absorption spectra ( see cen et al .",
    "1994 and related references in  [ intro ] ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0 optical depth @xmath17 along the line of sight is given by @xmath18 , mapped to redshift space , and smoothed with the thermal broadening window ( see e.g. hui , gnedin & zhang 1997 for details ) .",

    "two observables that have attracted a lot of attention and have been well measured are the transmission power spectrum and the mean decrement ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "these measurements can be used to yield constrains on parameters in the model , including @xmath26 which is proportional to @xmath16 .    in this paper , we make use of the analysis by zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark ( 2000 ) , who obtained constraints on 6 different parameters by matching the observed transmission power spectrum and mean decrement at @xmath62 from mcdonald et al .",

    "[ intro ] , there are at least two reasons why , strictly speaking , one obtains only lower bounds for the baryon fraction  first , not all baryons are necessarily in the forest , although a large fraction does appear to be ( i.e. @xmath5 in eq .",
    "[ [ a ] ] refers to only those baryons in the forest ) ; second , one often has strictly speaking only lower limits on the ionizing background @xmath71 , based on summing over contributions from known sources ( an exception is the use of the proximity effect ; another exception is an observational _ upper _ limit on @xmath37 from searches for fluorescent ly@xmath0 emission ; both are discussed below ) . in this section",
    ", we will discuss both the likelihood for @xmath5  as if all or most baryons are in the forest , and the total @xmath37 is known  as well as the lower - bound - likelihood for @xmath5 .",
    "let us begin by developing the idea of a lower - bound - likelihood .",
    "previous work often gave lower bounds on the baryon fraction as if they were strict bounds .",
    "of course ,",
    "uncertainties in @xmath37 , in the measured mean decrement , and in other parameters such as @xmath25 imply that such bounds have to be given a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "we show here the proper quantity to consider is _ a lower limit on the probability that @xmath5 is larger than some value_.    we have from eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) @xmath72 , where @xmath73 represents the parameters @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is some function which can be read off from eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) ( we will focus on @xmath41 in this paper ) .",
    "the probability that @xmath5 is larger than some value @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 represent the probability distributions of @xmath73 , @xmath69 and @xmath37 .",
    "we use @xmath79 to denote the probability distribution for the ionizing intensity from _ all _ possible sources , while the probability distribution @xmath80 that we will use , at least for some of the calculations below , comes from a summation over contributions from _ known _ sources , including lyman - break galaxies and quasars .",
    "the inequality above can be understood as follows . for any random variable @xmath81 with @xmath82 and",
    "independent , we have @xmath83 . by the same reasoning , the fact that the amount of baryons in the forest is necessarily smaller than the cosmological total only serves to strengthen the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ b0 ] ) .",
    "we introduce the symbol @xmath84 to denote the lower limit to the cumulative probability that @xmath5 is larger than some value @xmath76 .",

    "2001 ) ( at @xmath62 , @xmath64 plays essentially no role ) ; @xmath80 is what we turn to next .",
    "there are three main sources of information .    a recent analysis of proximity effect by scott et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( see also giallongo et al . 1996 ,",
    "cooke , epsey & carswell 1997 ) gave @xmath90 , averaged from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , which translates into @xmath93 .",

    "there are in addition a number of uncertainties , including uncertainty in the mean absorption by the intergalactic medium , and the use of the luminosity function down to magnitudes that are fainter than those used for the escape fraction measurements ( see steidel et al . for details ) .",

    ", we also show the optical depths we assumed for the dust and the igm , respectively ( in the continuous star formation case ; a somewhat larger dust opacity was needed for the instantaneous starburst ) . in the top panel ,",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows the mean observed flux in the wavelength range @xmath149 .    as the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] shows , in the @xmath150 range , the mean observed flux is @xmath151 ; while the continuous star formation models predict @xmath152 . taken at face value , the data reveals twice as high an ionizing flux as these models predict , even if we do not include any absorption by cold gas in the galaxy .",
    "the starburst model can come close to producing the observed ionizing flux at 912 , but only if an age of @xmath153yr is assumed .",
    "although the 29 galaxies included in the composite spectrum were selected from the bluest quartile of the sample , it appears unlikely that they were typically `` caught '' at such a young age .",
    "a short lifetime does appear to be consistent with the number density and clustering properties of lbg s ( e.g. wechsler et al .",
    "2001 ; but see also mo , mao & white 1999 ) , but it is disfavored by other arguments , such as the optical to near - infrared colors ( shapley et al . , in preparation ) , and by tentative measurements of mass  to  light ratios ( pettini et al .",
    "the ionizing radiation in the models is dominated by massive ob stars , and , as a result , after @xmath154 years , the starburst model predicts a rapidly diminishing value for the flux below 912 .",
    "the starburst model gives a ( cross - section weighted ) spectral slope of @xmath97 below @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "this slope is somewhat harder than typical quasar spectra in the relevant wavelength range just below @xmath155 .",
    "this is what we have used in ",
    "[ likelihood ] to convert measurements of @xmath55 to @xmath37 .",
    "the true value for @xmath51 is likely to be smaller due to absorption by the intergalactic medium  this gives us a lower limit on @xmath37 ( @xmath157 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ jhi ] ] ) .    taking the data at face value",
    ", the implication is that the stellar populations in lbgs produce @xmath158twice as many h  ionizing photons as the current models predict .",
    "this discrepancy is more severe at shorter wavelengths , where the igm is expected to become increasingly more opaque .",
    "note that although the mean igm opacity is directly measured by steidel et al . at @xmath159 , the variation of the opacity with wavelength across the range @xmath160 depends on the column density distribution of lyman @xmath0 absorption systems with column densities @xmath146 , and is more uncertain .",
    "changing the assumed metallicities , or adding the emission from the nebular continuum , does not significantly increase the predicted ionizing fluxes .",
    "the uv fluxes of ob stars can be increased by the presence of stellar winds ( not included in the stellar models we adopted ) .",
    "although winds can increase the heii  ionizing flux by orders of magnitude , the corresponding increase for the h  ionizing flux in o stars has been found to be small ( schaerer & de koter 1997 ) .",
    "the increase can be more significant for cooler b",
    " stars ( najarro et al . 1996 ) , but these stars do not dominate the ionizing photon budget in the continuous star  formation models , in which o  stars are continuously replenished .",
    "furthermore , the hydrostatic stellar models typically reproduce the properties of galactic hii regions ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , so that an increase by the required factor of @xmath161 would make it more difficult to reconcile the models with these observations .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the stellar population in the galaxies comprising the steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sample appear to be significantly different from spectral synthesis model predictions , and from stellar populations in nearby galaxies , unless the selection procedure somehow strongly favors very young galaxies ( i.e. age @xmath153 years ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether stellar models that include winds can account for the apparent difference .",
    "an alternative explanation of the large ionizing flux could be that the imf at @xmath13 is biased towards massive stars .",
    "although the nature of lbgs is not well understood , based on their observed fluxes and clustering properties , they appear to have luminosities similar to @xmath162l@xmath163 galaxies , and to be associated with halos of total mass @xmath164m@xmath139 ( in most models , see , e.g. wechsler et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "the escape of ionizing radiation from `` normal '' disk galaxies has been studied extensively in observations of the milky way ( reynolds et al .",
    "1995 ) and other nearby galaxies ( e.g. leitherer et al . 1995 ; hoopes , walterbos & rand 1999 ) ; as well as theoretically ( e.g. dove & shull 1994 ; dove , shull & ferrara 2000 ) . both theory and observations indicate small escape fractions that are of order @xmath165 . in a theoretical study extending galactic disk models to high redshift ,",
    "wood & loeb ( 2000 ) showed that if a few percent of the total gas mass would cool and settle into a rotationally supported thin disk , the escape fraction would be negligible from galaxies at @xmath6 in halos with a total mass @xmath166m@xmath139 ( the decrease in @xmath167 being due to the higher densities [ @xmath168 at higher redshifts ) . in comparison , the escape fraction in the steidel et al .",
    "sample is @xmath169 . as the fraction of 900 photons that escape the galaxy , divided by the same fraction for 1500 photons .",
    "thus , the actual escape fraction of 900 photons from the lbgs can be as small as @xmath170 , if dust absorbs @xmath171 of photons at both wavelengths .",
    "since dust opacity is not included in the theoretical models , this is a fair comparison . ]",
    "ionizing radiation could escape more efficiently from lbgs if most of the cold gas ( @xmath172 k ) were spread over an extended region , rather than incorporated into a fully  formed , dense galactic disk .",
    "such a spatially extended distribution for the cold gas would be natural during the earliest phases of galaxy formation , when galaxy ",
    "sized dark halos are assembling for the first time . alternatively , if star formation in lbgs is triggered by mergers ( see this model in wechsler et al .",
    "2000 ) , then the merger could spread the cold gas over a large solid angle . in either case , the diluted density would reduce the recombination rate ( @xmath173 ) , making it easier to keep the cold gas photoionized , and for the ionizing radiation to escape .    to quantify the required ionizing photon rate , we consider the simplified toy model for the cold gas distribution described in haiman & rees ( 2001 ) . in this model",
    ", the gas initially has a spherically symmetric distribution , with a radial profile dictated by hydrostatic equilibrium in an nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) dark matter halo .",
    "subsequently , a fraction of the gas , determined by the cooling efficiency , cools to @xmath174k , and resides in cold clumps whose densities are compressed by a factor @xmath175k ( where @xmath176k is the virial temperature of the halo ) .",
    "the rest of the gas remains in the collisionally ionized hot phase , at the temperature of @xmath177 .",
    "as an example of this model , the gas in a @xmath178m@xmath139 halo at @xmath148 ( virial temperature of @xmath179k , a @xmath180 object ) cools out to approximately half of the virial radius ( @xmath181kpc ) .",
    "the total recombination rate within the halo is @xmath182 is @xmath183s@xmath184 , where @xmath185 is the volume filling fraction of cold gas ( approximately unity out to @xmath186 , and dropping to negligible values at larger radii ) , and @xmath187 is the case - b hydrogen recombination coefficient evaluated at @xmath188k . with the standard salpeter imf , every stellar proton yields @xmath162 4000 ionizing photons , so that a star formation rate of 1 m@xmath139 yr@xmath184 translates to a production rate @xmath189 s@xmath184 of ionizing photons . in order to allow a large escape fraction ,",
    "most of this cold gas has to be kept photo",
    " ionized . increasing the above photon production rate by a factor of four , as suggested by the composite spectrum of steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we find that the required `` characteristic '' star formation rate is @xmath190m@xmath139 yr@xmath184 . this star formation rate is consistent with the luminosities of lbgs .",
    "furthermore , this rate converts only @xmath191 of the available gas into stars in @xmath141 yr , making our assumption of continuous star formation for @xmath192 years plausible .",
    "we also note that in this model , the required star formation rate for a halo of mass @xmath193 at redshift @xmath31 scales approximately as @xmath194 making it easier for ionizing radiation to escape from smaller halos ( see haiman & rees 2001 for details ) .",
    "the model described above is highly idealized , and should be regarded only as a plausibility argument that large escape fractions are possible with an extended gas distribution .",
    "these models predict that the photoionized cold gas could be detectable in the ly@xmath0 recombination line , as a low surface brightness `` fuzz '' with @xmath195 .",
    "deep ly@xmath0 imaging of extended regions around the lbgs can therefore furnish a method to test this model ( see haiman & rees 2001 for a similar discussion in the context of bright quasars ) .",
    "an alternative scenario is one in which the cold gas resides in clumps with a small covering factor .",
    "this could allow most of the ionizing photons to escape along lines of sights traversing only hot , collisionally ionized , medium .",
    "however , in a self  gravitating two  phase medium , this explanation requires a minimum cold clump size that exceeds the jeans mass of the cold phase ( rees 1988 ) . as a result",
    ", the postulated large clumps would be unstable to fragmentation , which would tend to increase the covering factor to unity .",
    "nevertheless , the covering factor of cold gas can be decreased by feedback mechanisms . indeed ,",
    "pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found evidence for galactic scale outflows ( `` superwinds '' of several hundred km / s ) in the spectra of lbgs to be ubiquitous .",
    "as noted in pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , such superwinds , driven by mechanical energy from supernova and stellar winds , can punch holes through the galactic disk , through which the ionizing radiation can escape .      to summarize ,",
    "the accuracy of the present constraints on the baryon fraction from the ly@xmath0 forest is limited by our knowledge of the ionizing background .",
    "a slight tension does exist between such constraints and the nucleosynthesis value , in that the forest measurements tend to prefer higher values for @xmath5 .",
    "however , even assuming the largest estimate of the ionizing background , which is dominated by contributions from lyman - break galaxies as reported by steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see model 3 in  [ lowerbound ] ) , the nucleosynthesis value is ruled out only at the @xmath2 level .",
    "we emphasize also that even if the ionizing background is known to high accuracy , substantial uncertainties remain , largely due to the uncertain thermal state of the intergalactic medium ( parametrized by @xmath25 and @xmath22  the temperature at mean density and the equation of state index ; see  [ model ] ) .",
    "present measurements give a probability distribution of @xmath5 which is well - approximated by a gaussian : @xmath196 \\label{pstarok}\\ ] ] _ if _ @xmath37 is fixed to be unity .",
    "we show in eq .",
    "( [ pstarj ] ) how the above probability can be used to obtain the probability distribution for @xmath5 , @xmath113 , given any distribution for @xmath37 ( in the extreme case , a delta function )",
    ". this will be useful as measurements of @xmath37 improve .",
    "we also show in  [ lowerbound ] how the lower bound likelihood can be obtained from a given @xmath113  this is a more appropriate quantity to consider if only strictly lower limits to the ionizing background are known .",
    "our results show that future improvements in the ly@xmath0 forest constraint on the baryon fraction will have to rely on improvements in measurements of the ionizing background and of the thermal state of the gas .",
    "the former can be achieved through a variety of means .",
    "measurements of the ionizing flux from lbg s extending to the redder population and fainter magnitudes will be useful . improved measurement of the proximity effect would , in principle , be especially powerful because it measures the sum total background of all sources . however , one main source of uncertainty is the large velocity shifts between different lines which affects estimates of the effect as a function of distance from quasars ( see e.g. scott et al .",
    "in addition , systematic effects due to clustering and peculiar velocities should be taken into account in the translation of absorption line statistics into the background flux  interestingly , loeb & eisenstein ( 1995 ) argued that these effects generally lead to an _",
    "over_-estimate of @xmath37 from standard proximity effect measurements .",
    "it is also useful to keep in mind the possibility of measuring @xmath71 from direct imaging of the fluorescent ly@xmath0 photons from optically thick systems ( gould & weinberg 1996 ) .",
    "the measurements of bunker , marleau & graham ( 1998 ) have already put an _ upper _",
    "limit on the ionizing background , which at the moment is still quite large ( 3-sigma upper limit is @xmath197 ) .",
    "deeper exposure to seek a definite detection would be very useful . as far as the thermal state of the intergalactic medium is concerned , larger sample size is crucial , and several techniques have proven useful for this purpose ( e.g. ricotti , gnedin & shull 2000 , bryan et al . 1999 , schaye et al .",
    "1999 , mcdonald et al .",
    "2001 , choudhury et al .",
    "2000 , zaldarriaga et al . 2000 ; but see also meiksin , bryan & machacek 2001 ) .",
    "we should also mention that a constraint on the baryon density can be obtained from the he ii forest as well ( e.g. wadsley , hogan & anderson 2000 ) .",
    "ultimately , as the error - bars on @xmath5 from the forest come down , we will have a very precise test of the gravitational instability model , for the forest in particular as well as for large scale structure in general . a statistically significant disagreement among constraints from the forest , nucleosynthesis and the microwave background would require some basic revision of our model .",
    "the findings of steidel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) regarding the lbg lyman - continuum deserve further study .",
    "their measurements imply an intrinsically hard stellar spectrum , which seems to require a ( perhaps unreasonably ) young population of stars ( 1 million years or so ) and/or an initial mass function that is biased towards massive stars .",
    "moreover , the large escape fraction for ionizing photons imply that the cold , optically thick gas in lbg s is likely distributed quite differently from what has been seen in local galaxies .",
    "possibilities include a model in which the cold gas is spatially extended over the halo , and has not settled into a dense galactic disk ; or a disk with large holes punched out by strong stellar winds , as suggested by pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    finally , it is interesting to note that there are some indications of a similar evolutionary trend in agn  a decrease of the escape fraction at lower redshifts .",
    "searches for intrinsic absorption at the lyman - edge at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath198 ) generally turn up only small lyman edge discontinuities in a small fraction of quasars ( see e.g. koratkar , kinney & bohlin 1992 , zheng et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand ,",
