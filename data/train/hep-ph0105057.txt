    "<S> ( [ global ] ) and ( [ smfit ] ) may persist or may become even more prominant . in that case , a possible intervention of new physics with a new phase affecting the cp asymmetry in the @xmath11 channel can not be ignored .    in the sm , the asymmetry in the @xmath11 channel is almost entirely mixing - induced . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent cp asymmetry is proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath3 appears in the phase of @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the decay amplitude of @xmath11 does not carry any weak phase at leading order in the wolfenstein parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> new physics might change the scenario in two ways . it can add a new weak phase in @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing and/or </S>",
    "<S> it can generate a new diagram for @xmath23 decay amplitude that carries a new weak phase . </S>",
    "<S> since the decay is cabibbo - favoured , one usually tends to overlook the latter possibility . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we examine the situation in which the decay is indeed affected by new physics , but the mixing amplitude is not . </S>",
    "<S> the point to note is that this scenario also induces a new physics amplitude in @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> now two things can happen . </S>",
    "<S> first , direct cp asymmetry may be induced in both @xmath11 and @xmath24 , which is non - existent in the sm . indeed , for this to happen there </S>",
    "<S> must also exist a strong phase difference between the sm and new physics diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> second , the mixing - induced cp asymmetry now depends not only on @xmath3 , it involves a new weak phase as well . as a result , equating the cp asymmetry to @xmath1 would be misleading . a combination of the ` true ' @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , the angle of the unitarity triangle , and other new parameters should now be related to the experimental cp asymmetry in the @xmath11 channel . </S>",
    "<S> this way it may be possible to explain why eqs .  ( [ global ] ) and ( [ smfit ] ) may disagree .    </S>",
    "<S> since the values of @xmath25 extracted from the cp asymmetry measurements in the asymmetric @xmath9 factories have a tendency to be somewhat lower than the sm fit value , one is prompted to look for models where such tendency is favoured . in models of minimal flavour violation , where there are no new operators beyond those in the sm and no new weak phase beyond the one in the ckm matrix , a conservative scanning of all relevant input parameters in a standard ckm - like analysis yields an absolute lower bound on @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the sm , several versions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and the two higgs doublet models are examples of this class . </S>",

    "<S> if cp violation in the @xmath10 system is purely supersymmetric , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 are completely explained by new phases of supersymmetric origin , then the ckm phase will be constrained from the charmless semileptonic @xmath9 decays and @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing . only in that case , as the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have argued , the ckm phase could be quite small leading to a very low @xmath29 . </S>",

    "<S> this brand of supersymmetry does not fall into the minimal flavour violating class , as it introduces new tree - level flavour changing operators . </S>",
    "<S> the essential points are outlined below . </S>",
    "<S> recall that in the mssm gauge invariance ensures neither the conservation of lepton number ( @xmath30 ) nor that of baryon number ( @xmath9 ) . using these quantum numbers @xmath4-parity is defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the spin of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is + 1 for all sm particles and @xmath33 for their superpartners . in a general supersymmetric model one </S>",
    "<S> should in principle allow @xmath4-parity - violating ( @xmath34 ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> tight constraints on the strength of these interactions exist in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though any concrete evidence for the existence of @xmath34 terms is still lacking , the observation of neutrino masses and mixings in solar and atmospheric neutrino data suggests that it would be premature to abandon the @xmath30-violating interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , to avoid rapid proton decay one can not simultaneously switch on both @xmath30- and @xmath9-violating interactions and for this reason we impose @xmath9 conservation by hand . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath30-violating superpotential that we consider here is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are lepton and quark doublet superfields , and @xmath38 is down quark singlet superfields . </S>",
    "<S> the essential point is that the @xmath39-interactions can contribute to non - leptonic @xmath9 decays at the tree level via slepton / sneutrino mediated graphs . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we focus on @xmath34 effects arising at the @xmath11 decay amplitude level rather than through @xmath21-@xmath22 mixing couplings from @xmath17 . ] .    a detailed analysis of @xmath4-parity violation on @xmath11 and @xmath40 decay modes </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have extended the formalism of @xcite , which was based on mixing induced cp violation only , by incorporating the effects of the strong phase difference between the interfering amplitudes ( an essential ingredient of direct cp violation ) . </S>",

    "<S> the best constraints come from the measurements of @xmath70 branching ratio , which we will derive in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the essential formalism @xcite is described below . </S>",
    "<S> first note that due to the isospin structure of the interaction , the above product couplings contribute both to @xmath71 ( i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 ( i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath70 ) at tree level . while for the former the diagram is slepton mediated , for the latter it is sneutrino mediated . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume that both the slepton and sneutrino are degenerate . again </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath70 the leading sm diagram is a penguin , while the @xmath34 interaction , as mentioned before , proceeds at the tree level . </S>",
    "<S> the sm and @xmath34 effective hamiltonians for @xmath75 lead to the following amplitudes : [ hpsm ] k^-|h_sm|b^- & = & v_tb v^*_ts + & & , + [ hpr ] k^-|h_|b^- & = & - ( d^r_222 + d^l_222 )   , where @xmath76 may be obtained analogously to the way @xmath77 was determined via eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we further simplify the situation by assuming that only one combination , say the one corresponding to @xmath81 , is non - zero , i.e. the exchanged scalar is a tau - sneutrino . </S>",

    "<S> this example demonstrates that @xmath11 need not be a ` gold - plated ' channel for the determination of @xmath26 . rather , it could provide a window for new physics to manifest . note that no drastic assumption , like large rescattering effects , etc , parametrized by a large @xmath100 , was required to arrive at the above conclusion . in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the variation of @xmath25 with @xmath68 for different values of @xmath58 and fixed @xmath101 . </S>",

    "<S> this is a conservative approach , as for a larger mixing one needs a larger value of the @xmath34 product coupling . with the above value of the product coupling , it is possible to arrange an even larger negative @xmath97 , than obtained using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ r ] ) , that can completely cancel the ` true ' @xmath98 inside the sine function of @xmath99 , which renders the latter almost zeroish . </S>",

    "<S> our approach has been a conservative one . </S>",
    "<S> however , leaving aside any theoretical argument , one can put an experimental constraint on @xmath59 for a given value of @xmath68 and @xmath58 . to do this we first take @xmath107 and @xmath108 as a reference point , which yielded the minimum @xmath25 in our model . </S>",

    "<S> the presence of a non - zero @xmath63 can further disturb the extraction of @xmath26 which resides inside @xmath99 .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental branching ratio @xmath110 @xcite is a factor of three to four higher than what one obtains from pure short distance effects involving naive factorization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do not attempt to solve this puzzle in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we only make a remark that if the long distance contributions for short distance sm and @xmath34 operators behave similarly , then the long distance effects on @xmath29 will be minimal . since the sm and @xmath34 operator structures are different , a separate study in this hitherto unexplored area is required . </S>",
    "<S> we do not get into those details in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> a few comments on a previous analysis @xcite of @xmath34 effects on @xmath11 are now in order . </S>",
    "<S> the bounds on @xmath34 couplings used in @xcite are @xmath111 @xmath112 derived in @xcite . as a result of such a strong constraint , </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of @xmath11 changes only marginally . </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis led to a conclusion that the determination of @xmath26 via @xmath11 was rather robust . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we counter this conclusion on the following ground . we notice that the bounds derived in @xcite are ` basis - dependent ' , whose meaning is explained below . </S>",
    "<S> if only one @xmath39 coupling in the weak basis is non - zero , more than one such coupling becomes non - zero in the mass basis , which are related to one another by the ckm elements . </S>",
    "<S> this way one can generate flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) either in the down quark sector or in the up quark sector , depending on whether the ckm mixing is in the down sector or in the up sector respectively . strong constraints on the @xmath39 couplings emerge if one considers fcncs completely in the down sector . </S>",
    "<S> if one chooses the other extreme , namely fcncs entirely in the up sector , the constraints are not that tight . </S>",
    "<S> since the choice of this basis is completely arbitrary , we prefer not to use such basis - dependent bounds in our analysis mainly because the conclusion depends heavily on this choice . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if one duly scales the exchanged down - squark mass to 300 gev in view of its collider constraints , the limit used in @xcite gets relaxed by an order of magnitude , and becomes closer to our limit in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lpbound ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> a general study of cp violating @xmath9 decays in nonleptonic modes in supersymmetric models with broken @xmath4-parity can also be found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the couplings @xmath80 we have used in our analysis to reproduce a low @xmath113 may have nontrivial impact on other processes as well . if a correlation is observed among the phenomena ocurring in these processes , it will certainly provide a strong motivation for the kind of new physics interactions we have advocated in our paper . </S>",
    "<S> these benchmark tests are listed below :    * 1 . *   </S>",
    "<S> the sm amplitude of @xmath8-@xmath105 mixing involves @xmath114 , and is real to a very good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can expect the @xmath23 decays of the @xmath8 meson ( e.g. @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) to be cp conserving . </S>",
    "<S> but as mentioned before , the @xmath69 couplings can contribute to @xmath8-@xmath105 mixing through slepton mediated box graphs , which can interfere with the sm diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the same combinations , we have seen before , also affect the @xmath42 decay amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and the weak phase of the above product coupling needed to produce a low cp asymmetry in @xmath11 channel would necessarily give rise to a sizable cp asymmetry in the @xmath115 and @xmath117 modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that neither @xmath4-parity conserving susy nor any other minimal flavour violating models can induce cp violation in the latter channels . in some sense </S>",
    "<S> , therefore , its observation will provide a necessary test for our scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the non - observation , on the other hand , will rule out our explanation of low @xmath29 in @xmath11 . in any case , to observe cp violation in @xmath8 decays , we have to wait till the second generation @xmath9 factories , namely the lhc - b and btev , start taking data .    * </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> *   we have put constraints on the magnitude of the @xmath80 couplings from the experimental @xmath70 branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the cp asymmetry in its neutral counterpart , namely the @xmath40 channel , is again expected to be proportional to @xmath25 in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> now since the sm amplitudes for @xmath11 and @xmath40 are quite different , it is quite apparent that in new physics inspired scenario , the cp asymmetries measured in those two processes could yield values of @xmath26 not only different from the ` true ' @xmath26 but also different from each other @xcite . in other words , @xmath118 . again , to verify these non - equalities , we have to depend on the results from the second generation @xmath9 factories .    </S>",
    "<S> * 3 . </S>",
    "<S> *   it has been pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the same @xmath80 couplings can successfully explain the @xmath119 anomaly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the magnitude and phase of the above couplings required to produce a low @xmath113 explains the anomaly by enhancing the sm branching ratio of @xmath119 to its experimental value . </S>",
    "<S> note again that none of the minimal flavour violating models can do this job .    </S>",
    "<S> * 4 . *   </S>",
    "<S> it has been claimed that @xmath25 can be determined very cleanly from the branching ratio measurements of the rare decays @xmath120 and @xmath121 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these processes , unlike those previously mentioned , will not be affected by our choice of @xmath34 couplings . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of @xmath3 extracted from these rare @xmath10 decay processes with those obtained from several @xmath9 decay channels may offer a powerful tool for probing physics beyond the sm .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the distinctly lower central value of the babar measurement of cp asymmetry in the @xmath11 channel can be explained in models of supersymmetry with broken @xmath4-parity . in the process , we have derived new upper limits on the relevant @xmath34 couplings from the experimental @xmath70 branching ratio . </S>",
    "<S> it should be admitted though that the ability of the @xmath34 interactions to lower @xmath113 is indeed shared by a few minimal flavour violating models , e.g. mssm or msugra . </S>",
    "<S> thus if the disagreement between @xmath113 and @xmath122 persists , this will signal new physics no doubt , but just with this single piece of information one can not distinguish betwen the different models . </S>",
    "<S> what makes our scenario special is that it can do certain other jobs what the minimal flavour violating models can not . </S>",
    "<S> we have outlined them above . </S>",
    "<S> some of these tests can be carried out only in the second generation @xmath9 factories . </S>",
    "<S> these tests can either boost our scenario or can rule it out . </S>"
