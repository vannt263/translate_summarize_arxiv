    "the studies of the fluctuations of the charged particles multiplicity in heavy nuclei collisions provide information on the particle production and the properties of the matter created in these collisions @xcite .",

    "we use the wounded nucleon model @xcite to calculate the values of @xmath13 for the the same pseudorapidity bins as in the phobos experiment .",
    "first we perform calculations for the simple case of elementary @xmath2 interactions and then we extend them to @xmath0 collisions and different centralities .",
    "we show that the wounded nucleon model reproduces reasonably well the experimental data , especially the centrality dependence of the forward - backward fluctuations .    in the next section",
    "we define the model in detail . in section 3",
    "we describe our monte carlo calculations and present the approximate analytical formula for @xmath13 derived in the framework of the wounded nucleon model in the appendix . in section 4 our results are compared with the phobos data and also predictions of other models of nucleus - nucleus collisions are discussed .",

    ": pseudorapidity density of produced particles from the forward - moving wounded nucleon at @xmath18 gev c.m .",
    "the wounded nucleon model @xcite assumes that after the collision of two nuclei , the secondary particles are produced in the process of independent fragmentation of these nucleons ( called  wounded nucleons  ) , which underwent at least one inelastic collision .",
    "the contribution from a wounded nucleon does not depend on the number of such collisions , thus the secondary particles are produced according to a universal fragmentation function , @xmath19 .",
    "number of produced particles may vary following a multiplicity distribution .",
    "the shape of the fragmentation function was extracted @xcite from the phobos data on @xmath20 collisions @xcite at @xmath21 gev and is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_wn ] for a wounded nucleon from the forward moving nuclei .",
    "the fragmentation function for nucleons from the opposite nuclei is a reflection with respect to @xmath22 .    in this model",
    "the single particle density in elementary @xmath2 collisions is described as @xmath23 . in the case of nucleus - nucleus collision",
    "it becomes a sum of these functions multiplied by the number of wounded nucleons in the appropriate nuclei @xcite : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mean values of wounded nucleons in the forward and backward moving nucleus , respectively . in consequence at midrapidity",
    "the particle density in @xmath27 equals @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 ) and is thus @xmath30 times larger than in elementary collisions .",
    "this prediction does not agree with the experimental data , however , as the particle density @xmath31 dataauau .",
    "this can be easily corrected by introduction of a centrality dependent factor @xmath32 which appropriately increases the multiplicity of particles generated in the fragmentation of a wounded nucleon that underwent many inelastic collisions .",
    "the necessity of the above correction results from the composite structure of the nucleons .",
    "it is accounted for in the wounded quark - diquark model ff - bb , where the fragmenting objects are quarks and diquarks , and which reproduces the particle density measured in @xmath27 collisions .",
    "the fragmentation of a wounded nucleon is equal in this approach to a sum of fragmentation functions of the quark and diquark weighted by the probability of  wounding  each of them .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath32 introduced by us reflects the changes of these probabilities for different centralities of the collisions .",
    "the wounded nucleon model with our correction is equivalent to the wounded quark - diquark model in the kinematical area , where the fragmentation of spectators ( unwounded constituents ) is negligible ff - bb .",
    "this is fully justified in our case , as we are analyzing data restricted to @xmath11 .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath19 represents the mean yield from a wounded nucleon , whereas for calculation of fluctuations the changes occurring event - by - event have to be included .",
    "we assume that the shape of @xmath33 is unchanged , even if the integral of @xmath19 follows a multiplicity distribution .",
    "further we also assume that the multiplicity distributions in @xmath2 collisions in the combined pseudorapidity bin @xmath34 can be parameterized by negative binomial ( nb ) distribution ua5 - 200-n - k @xmath35where @xmath36 is the average multiplicity in the combined interval @xmath34 , @xmath37 measures deviation from poisson distribution and @xmath38 is the gamma function . in our calculations",
    "we need to know the multiplicity distribution from a single wounded nucleon . assuming that soft particle production in @xmath2 collisions can be described by independent contributions from each nucleon @xcite , it is straightforward to show that the multiplicity distribution from a single wounded nucleon follows also nb distribution ( [ nbd ] ) but with @xmath36 and @xmath39 substituted by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively independent wounded nucleons is given by nb distribution ( [ nbd ] ) with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath36 and @xmath39 are measured in @xmath44 collisions . ] .    to perform the necessary calculations we also need to know the probability that a particle originating from the forward moving wounded nucleon goes to @xmath45 interval , under the condition it is found either in @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "it can be easily calculated as @xmath46where @xmath47 is the pseudorapidity density of produced particles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_wn ] . in consequence",
    "the probability that a particle originating from the forward moving wounded nucleon goes to @xmath8 interval equals @xmath48 .",
    "for the backward moving wounded nucleon @xmath49 has the same meaning when the intervals @xmath9 and @xmath8 are exchanged .",
    "the @xmath36 parameter from nb distribution can be also calculated using the fragmentation function @xmath50    for the nucleus - nucleus collisions in our modified version of the wounded nucleon model the multiplicity of particles from a single wounded nucleon is rescaled by @xmath32 factor .",
    "it reflects the fact that a wounded nucleon which underwent many inelastic collisions produces more particles than a wounded proton in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "accordingly , in eq .",
    "( [ nbd ] ) we substitute @xmath36 not by @xmath51 but by @xmath52 .",
    "less obvious is the necessity of modification of @xmath39 parameter , which we decided to multiply also by the factor @xmath32 .",
    "this is justified if we assume that each nucleon is composed of two constituents , a quark and a diquark , which populate particles independently .",
    "however , we show also results for unmodified @xmath39 and we consider the difference between them as an additional systematic uncertainty of the wounded nucleon model .",
    "in the present section we describe the mc calculation of @xmath13 defined in eq .",
    "( [ s2_def ] ) in the modified wounded nucleon model .",
    "in addition we present also approximate analytical formulae ( with @xmath36 and @xmath39 rescaled be the factor @xmath53 ) derived in the appendix .",
    "we performed our calculations in three steps described below .",
    "\\(a ) in order to study effects of simple superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions we assume that in both nuclei we have fixed number of wounded nucleons @xmath54 .",
    "each wounded nucleon adds it s contribution generated independently according to the nb distribution ( eq . [ nbd ] ) with parameters @xmath36 and @xmath39 substituted by @xmath52 and @xmath55 respectively , where @xmath36 and @xmath39 are measured in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the generated particles are then assigned randomly , with probability @xmath49 and @xmath48 , to the intervals @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( for the forward moving wounded nucleon ; to @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the backward moving nucleon ) .",
    "our main observation is that this contribution very quickly saturates with increasing @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 it practically does not depend on @xmath56 . in the appendix we present the approximate analytical derivation of the asymptotic formula for large @xmath56 , which is : @xmath58    this term depends only on the ratio @xmath59 , thus it is insensitive to our modification of the wounded nucleon model , i.e. the simultaneous substitution @xmath60 and @xmath61 . except the most peripheral events @xmath62 is centrality independent .",
    "\\(b ) contribution solely from the fluctuations in the number of wounded nucleons can be obtained when we assume that each wounded nucleon fragments always into the same , mean number of particles .",
    "then each forward moving wounded nucleon populates @xmath63 particles into the forward @xmath9 interval and @xmath64 particles into the backward @xmath8 interval ( and analogously for the backward moving nucleons ) . in consequence",
    "we obtain @xmath65 ,   \\notag \\\\ n_{b } & = \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma \\bar{n}\\left [ w_{b}p+w_{f}(1-p)\\right ] , \\label{t1}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath56 and @xmath66 are the numbers of wounded nucleons in the forward and backward moving nuclei , respectively .",
    "the above formulae allow to substitute @xmath7 and @xmath6 in the definition of @xmath13 ( eq .  [ s2_def ] ) : @xmath67    this term explicitly depends on @xmath56 and @xmath66 and thus is sensitive to the centrality of the events sample .",
    "moreover this term is sensitive to the @xmath68 factor which was introduced to correct the wounded nucleon model .",
    "the distribution of @xmath56 and @xmath66 can not be obtained in a model independent way . in order to match the experimental centrality definition we are using the events from the hijing generator , for which cuts compatible with these for the phobos experimental data were performed @xcite . however , similar results can be obtained if @xmath56 and @xmath66 are obtained from the glauber type mc generator using centrality cuts on impact parameter or on @xmath69 .",
    "\\(c ) the full calculations combine ( a ) and ( b ) together and include both the multiplicity distribution and the fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath66 are taken from generated hijing events .",
    "next each wounded nucleon populates particles according to the distribution ( [ nbd ] ) in a procedure similar to that from ( a ) .",
    "results of full simulations are practically identical with the sum of two previously described terms ( a ) and ( b ) .",

    "the effects increasing @xmath13 , already contained in the multiplicity distribution measured in elementary @xmath2 collisions are enhanced by superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the fluctuations of the number of wounded nucleons , that cause the difference @xmath74 to be non - zero , further increase the @xmath3 .",

    "the wounded nucleon model predictions in most cases are consistent within the errors with the data and slightly lower values of @xmath125 may be due to short range correlations , which are only partially accounted for in the model . anyway , we reproduce both the pseudorapidity and centrality dependence of @xmath3 in contrast to much more advanced hijing , ampt or urqmd models .",
    "\\(ii ) the key ingredients of our approach are : the assumption of independent hadronization of each wounded nucleon ; the wounded nucleon multiplicity distribution described by the negative binomial distribution ( [ nbd ] ) and ; the wounded nucleon pseudorapidity fragmentation function , shown in fig .",

    "it can be observed that @xmath121 is proportional to @xmath126 where @xmath49 determines the partition of each particle between forward and backward intervals .",
