    "we report on a similar behavior observed in incompressible hydrodynamic flows in a taylor - couette apparatus where it is observed that certain characteristics of the global flow are largely dictated by the boundaries .",
    "this finding is particularly relevant for experiments that examine quasi - keplerian ( qk ) flows , that is , rotation satisfying @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the fluid angular velocity and @xmath3 is the radial coordinate , as models of astrophysical systems , namely accretion disks .",
    "numerous recent studies have commented on the hydrodynamic stability of such systems @xcite , with extensions to magnetohydrodynamics in electrically conducting fluids @xcite .",
    "while there is some disagreement between studies as to whether hydrodynamic turbulence can be induced in qk flows , the balance seems to lean toward the negative , at least insofar as incompressible turbulence is considered , and points to the important role of magnetohydrodynamic effects in astrophysical systems .",
    "however , while it is known that qk flows are linearly stable it remains unknown whether there exists a nonlinear transition to turbulence , even for incompressible hydrodynamic systems .",
    "some experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite indicate that such a transition is not likely , while others present evidence that suggests that a subcritical transition may exist @xcite and some simulations find significant transient growth of perturbations that may allow for nonlinear effects to enter @xcite .",
    "fluid experiments in other regimes of operation that are not astrophysically- elevant have observed bi - stability @xcite , suggesting that should a similar mechanism exist for qk systems then a subcritical pathway to turbulence may explain angular momentum transport in accretion disks @xcite .",
    "we show in this work that the influence of the boundaries is intimately connected to the global structure of flows in taylor- ouette experiments and , by extension , is also related to the tendency of these systems to generate and sustain turbulence .",
    "one of the long - standing challenges of taylor - couette experiments in the quest to understand angular momentum transport in astrophysically - relevant flows has been the parasitic presence of ekman circulation ( secondary circulation ) induced by the mismatch between the fluid velocity and the solid body rotation of the axial boundaries .",
    "a significant reduction in ekman circulation has been realized in experiment by using axial boundaries that are split into multiple rings capable of differential rotation .",
    "under particular boundary conditions , azimuthal velocity profiles of the fluid can be generated that very nearly match that of ideal couette rotation @xcite , the rotation profile that is expected in the absence of axial influences for a constant radial flux of angular momentum , and has been observed to hold over a wide range of reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "in contrast , studies in the `` classical '' configuration where the axial boundaries rotate with the outer cylinder have shown performance that further deviates from ideal couette as the reynolds number is increased @xcite .",
    "such trends are revealing of whether these systems are dominated by boundary interactions or internal dynamics , a distinction with important consequences for the applicability of such experiments to interpretation of astrophysical systems , especially at large reynolds numbers .",
    "first , through the experiments reported here we identify two necessary criteria that define constraints on the boundary configurations that allow near - ideal flows to develop .",
    "we then discuss the competing roles of radial ( stewartson ) boundary layers and axial ( ekman ) boundary layers , from which we develop a model that describes the quantitative departure of the rotation profiles from ideal couette flow as a function of the angular momentum fluxes through the boundaries .",
    "a taylor - couette ( tc ) device is a system of coaxial cylinders that rotate independently of each other with the experimental fluid region between .",
    "the tc apparatus used in these studies , called the hydrodynamic turbulence experiment ( htx ) , is a modified version of the classical device in that the axial boundaries in htx are segmented to allow differential rotation across the boundaries @xcite .",

    "we now address whether there is a method for predicting this optimal value of @xmath12 .    the transition between the bulk flow and the walls of the tc device , which may move at very different speeds , occurs over thin boundary layers .",

    "the fluxes of angular momentum across these boundary layers , being inversely proportional to the boundary layer thickness , do not scale proportionally , and hence we anticipate that self - similarity of the global properties need not be preserved as the reynolds number is scaled .",
    "thus , while the observed variation in the shape of the ` ekman ` and ` split ` profiles is expected , it comes as some surprise that the ` optimized ` profiles are effectively independent of the reynolds number .",
    "the experiments reported here showed no significant temporal variation in the mean values , hence , it can be stated that in steady - state the net flux of angular momentum into these flows must sum to zero , that is , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the fluxes integrated over the inner and outer cylinders , respectively , and @xmath34 is the axial flux integrated over each axial boundary ( with inward towards the fluid defined as a positive flux ) .",
    "the ideal couette profile is the response to a constant radial flux of angular momentum , implying that @xmath35 and that the axial fluxes of angular momentum are everywhere zero .",
    "such a state can be imagined in a tc system with free - slip conditions on the axial boundaries , or with a continuously variable boundary that can perfectly match the ideal couette profile , conditions that will result in vanishing stress at the axial boundaries .",

    "even though there is , in general , a large mismatch between fluid and axial boundary speeds , we find that the flows under the ` optimized ` boundary conditions very closely approximate the ideal couette profile , and therefore have a nearly constant radial flux of angular momentum . we now show that rather than satisfying the condition that the axial flux of angular momentum everywhere vanishes , these flows satisfy a much weaker constraint : it is the surface integral of the axial angular momentum flux that vanishes , that is , @xmath41 .    to calculate the axial flux of angular momentum ,",
    "being proportional to @xmath42 , we make the assumption that @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the difference of the boundary angular velocity ( @xmath30 ) and the fluid angular velocity just inside the ekman boundary layer ( @xmath2 ) , and that @xmath45 represents the thickness of an ekman boundary layer with an unknown numerical constant @xmath46 .",

    ", one can employ mechanical advantages as we have done in htx , such as extensions of the inner and outer cylinder or independent rings . despite the desire to simplify the mechanical design of such modified tc devices",

    "greater insight into the balance of forces in quasi- eplerian flows could be explored in future experiments in modified taylor couette devices like htx .",
    "in particular , further exploration of the reynolds number dependence on these deviations , the dependence of the model parameters on @xmath107 , and the structure of the ekman cells would tell us much more about the influence of the boundaries on global behavior .",
    "we have shown that nearly ideal flows exhibit profile shape invariance under scaling of the reynolds number , an effect we interpret through the dual conditions of vanishing axial angular momentum flux and vanishing pressure differential that are nearly simultaneously satisfied , offering predictive capability for selecting optimized boundary conditions and in experimental design . the strongest piece of evidence in support of this model is the prediction of self - similarity of the profiles with respect to scaling of the reynolds number only for cases in which the axial flux of angular momentum and the pressure differential vanish nearly coincidentally , a prediction in excellent agreement with the observations presented in fig .",
    "it should be reiterated that while the experiments for ` optimized ` flows show very small departures from ideal couette , and whose interpretation is congruent with the coincident zeros in @xmath57 and @xmath34 , this does not strictly prove that these criteria represent true sufficient conditions . an interesting problem for",
    "future studies would be to measure how the departures from ideal couette depend on the `` distance '' between these zeros .",
    "it is interesting to note that in all cases presented here the local axial fluxes of angular momentum may be quite large given the substantial difference in speed between the bulk fluid and the axial boundaries , and that it is only on summation over the axial boundaries that zero net axial flux is realized for the ` optimized ` cases . recalling that multiple experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite have observed a nearly uniform axial structure through the bulk of the fluid volume",
    ", the existence of the large axial fluxes naturally raises the question : what allows the bulk flows to depart from the solid body rotation forced by the boundaries ?",
    "intuition based on the taylor - proudman theorem for rayleigh - stable flows , that is @xmath113 , would suggest that the bulk should tend to follow the boundary .",
    "however , it should be recalled that the ekman boundary layers do not need to satisfy the taylor- roudman theorem because the axial gradient of @xmath13 is balanced with a viscous diffusion of vorticity over the scale of the boundary layer thickness .",
    "thus , the nearly uniform axial structure suggests that the large fluxes of angular momentum that must be present due to the existence of the the ekman boundary layers are redistributed locally , perhaps by small ekman cells that do not extend far into the bulk of the fluid or even in the boundary layers themselves . as has been shown in prior studies , the free - shear layer that develops at the interface between the differentially rotating rings on the axial boundaries",
    "is expected to be centrifugally unstable and may help to enhance the redistribution of angular momentum locally @xcite .    another problem for future experiments , both physical and numerical , will be to explore in greater detail how the very large , local fluxes of angular momentum are redistributed near the axial boundaries with only minor effect on the bulk flow in the ` optimized ` configurations . non - optimized boundaries , like the ` split ` and ` ekman ` configurations , show progressive departure from the ideal couette flow as the reynolds number is increased , in agreement with the expectations of a dominant axial flux of angular momentum .",
    "a good test for numerical experiments will be to accurately model the global behavior of the mean flows in tc experiments by properly accounting for the angular momentum fluxes from the boundaries .",
    "we believe that the boundary layer scalings presented here may enable simulations to bootstrap to larger effective reynolds numbers by using specified boundary flux models , thus bypassing the need for very fine grids to resolve the boundary layer structure directly . with the combination of recent simulations of qk flows that can attain reynolds numbers of the order of @xmath114 @xcite , though with axially - periodic boundary conditions , a specified - flux boundary model may allow simulations to reach something resembling experimental conditions of large reynolds number tc flows .",
