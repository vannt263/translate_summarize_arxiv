    "0.3 cm in a study of `` discovery potential '' and data analysis of present high energy experiments the problems of precise predictions including , simultaneously , signal signatures of the new ( or studied ) physics , backgrounds , as well as all detector related effects should be analysed .",
    "it is generally believed that a monte carlo simulation of the full chain from the beam collision to detector response is the most convenient technique to address such question .",
    "in general it is indispensable to divide monte carlo simulation into separate blocks : physics event generation and detector response .",
    "later event generation can be divided further into parts , describing for example production and decay of the intermediate states .    in the present paper",
    "we will concentrate on the particular class of the processes involving polarised @xmath0 leptons .",
    "the two main goals of the present paper are : @xmath12 presentation of the algorithm for matching @xmath0 lepton decay and its production , with some control over spin effects ; in particular in case of @xmath13 production mechanism , @xmath14 discussion of physical observables sensitive to the spin correlations in the @xmath0 pair production .",
    "spin correlations in the decay of @xmath0 leptons not only can help to suppress irreducible background to the possible resonant @xmath0 pair production at lhc , such as the mssm higgs bosons decays , but also help to determine the spin nature of this resonanse .",
    "in the papers  @xcite tauola monte carlo package for simulation of @xmath0 lepton decay was described .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , technical details convenient for using the code in multi - purpose environment were collected , and universal interface for combining the simulation of @xmath0 lepton decay , with different packages for generation of physics event was proposed .",
    "scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite relies on the information stored in the hepevt common block @xcite only , and not on the details specific for the production generator , such as pythia @xcite ( used in our examples ) .",
    "in fact , such an interface can be considered as a separate software project , to some degree independent both from the specific problem of @xmath0 production and its decay .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in the next section we will describe new algorithm for extracting elementary @xmath15 body reaction for @xmath16 , which is necessary for properly introducing spin correlations into generation chain . in sec .",
    "3 we analyze spin content of such an elementary function . sec . 4",
    "is dedicated to the discussion of their consequences for the distributions of physics interest . in sec .",
    "5 we discuss few observables where spin effects can improve separation of the higgs boson signature , in case of the 14 tev @xmath17 collisions .",
    "summary closes the paper . in appendix",
    ", we explain the basic scheme of the spin treatment used in our code .",
    "it completes the program manual given in ref .  @xcite",
    "the exact way of calculating spin state of any final state is with the help of the matrix element and the rigorous density matrix treatment .",
    "this is however not always possible or necessary .",
    "often , like in the case of the production and decay of particles in the ultra - relativistic limit a simplified approach can be sufficient .",
    "such an approach was developed for koralz monte carlo program @xcite and its limitations were studied with the help of matrix element calculations of the order @xmath19 @xcite . in the following , we study the question whwter the approach can be generalised , and the approximate spin correlation calculated from the information stored in the hepevt common block filled by `` any '' @xmath0 production program .",
    "the approximation consists of reconstructing information of the elementary @xmath20 body process @xmath21 , buried inside multi - body production process .",
    "let us stress that such a procedure can never be fully controlled , as its functioning depends on the way the production program fills the hepevt common block .",
    "it will be always responsibility of the user to check if in the particular case the implemented algorithm is applicable .",
    "nonetheless our aim is _ not _ to replace the matrix element calculations , but rather to provide a method of calculating / estimating spin effects in cases when spin effects would not be taken care of , at all .",
    "needless to say such an approach is limited ( for the spin treatment ) to the approximation not better than leading - log , and to the longitudinal spin degrees only .",
    "the principle of calculating kinematic variables is simple .",
    "the 4-momenta of the @xmath20 body process have to be found .",
    "the 4-momenta of the outcoming @xmath0 s are used directly .",
    "initial state momenta are constructed from the incoming and outcoming momenta of the particles ( or fields ) accompanying production of the @xmath22 state state does not need to be explicitly coded in the hepevt common block . note that if available , information from the history part of the event , where the 4-momenta of gluons quarks etc .",
    "are stored , will be used . ] .",
    "we group them accordingly to fermion number flow , and ambiguous additional particles are grouped ( summed ) into effective quarks to minimise their virtualities .",
    "such an approach is internally consistent in the case of emission of photons or gluons within the leading log approximation .",
