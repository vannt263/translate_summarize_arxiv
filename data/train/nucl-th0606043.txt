    "exploring the phases of nuclear and quark matter has recently been subject of intensive investigation both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the phase structure of qcd is relevant for a variety of phenomena , from heavy - ion collisions to neutron stars and the early universe . in particular",
    ", such studies may reveal the existence of matter in a new state which may be described by the elementary fields of qcd , i.e. quarks and gluons .",
    "one of the most interesting question in qcd phase diagram is to find the phase boundary between the hadronic and quark phases .",
    "it has been well documented that at zero baryonic density , chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transition occur at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "our current understanding of qcd phase structure at finite density is still rudimentary .",
    "ab initio lattice monte - carlo simulation can not be directly used due to the complexity of the sampling weight , the so - called sign problem . on the other hand , there is no alternative approach to accommodate all relevant non - perturbative features of qcd and describe both phases in a unified way .",
    "various lattice simulation techniques have recently been proposed in order to circumvent the lattice sign problem ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "but all of them still suffer from systematic uncertainties which made them reliable at very low chemical potential . at low temperature and large densities ,",
    "a number of model calculations appear to agree on a first order phase transition between nuclear and quark matter @xcite .",
    "therefore , one expects that a first order phase transition at finite density will end in a second order endpoint and then turns into a rapid crossover at small chemical potential @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , this indicates that as we approach to lower temperature and finite baryonic density , the phase transition becomes stronger .    at the nuclear matter saturation point the fermi momentum @xmath0 and the pion mass @xmath1 are of comparable scale @xmath2 mev",
    "this implies that at the densities of interest in nuclear physics @xmath3 , pions and chiral dynamics must be important .",
    "the methods of chiral perturbation theory exploit this observation and have been successful to describe the nuclear matter properties @xcite . by estimating the volume occupied by a single nucleon from its mean square charge radius @xmath4",
    ", one may conclude that baryonic matter is dilute up to about @xmath5 , since it can satisfy the diluteness condition @xmath6 . at higher",
    "density nucleons start to overlap .",
    "nuclear matter is dilute and at the same time it is strongly correlated since @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the scattering length .",
    "on the other hand , since the fermi momentum exceeds the qcd scale parameter @xmath9 mev , multiple scattering between nucleons on the fermi surface start to probe distance of the order @xmath10 and the nucleonic substructure becomes visible .",
    "the fermi momentum at saturation point is in fact of the order of @xmath11 .",
    "the confinement scale can even become one order of magnitude smaller at moderate baryonic density @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate to ask whether confinement and nuclear matter saturation mechanisms are interconnected .",
    "the delta - nucleon mass splitting @xmath12 mev is also comparable to the fermi momentum @xmath0 at nuclear matter saturation .",
    "it is known that the main mechanism behind the delta - nucleon mass splitting is related to their different internal diquark configurations @xcite .",
    "namely , the delta is made of only axial vector diquarks while nucleons can be constructed from both the scalar and axial vector diquarks .",
    "this indicates that perhaps diquark dynamics at nuclear matter saturation point might be also relevant .",
    "the relevance of diquarks as an efficient way to incorporate the non - perturbative feature of qcd and to simplify the underlying dynamics has been well - known for years ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , baryons properties in vacuum have been successfully described in the covariant diquark - quark picture @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also been shown that nuclear matter properties can be described by simulating the nucleons as relativistic bound states of the diquarks and quarks @xcite . at high density diquark concept",
    "is also crucial to describe the color superconductivity phenomenon @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if diquarks as bound states exist , they can in principle undergo bose - einstein condensation since they are bosons .",
    "therefore , it seems to be natural to assume that baryonic matter at some density undergoes phase transition to diquark bec matter .",
    "one of the motivations behind this paper is to explore such a transition .",
    "based on the above scaling argument , it seems that the most important non - perturbative features of qcd might be involved in the nuclear matter saturation density . in this paper",
    "we attempt to address such a possible connection between the nuclear matter saturation properties and chiral restoration and the deconfinement effect at zero temperature .",
    "we simulate the quark deconfinement at finite density by allowing that the active degrees of freedom change from nucleons to diquarks at high density .",
    "this may lead to a first order deconfinement phase transition , in accordance with indications from earlier studies @xcite .",
    "we calculate the nuclear and diquark equations of state ( eos ) at zero temperature . in particular",
    ", we will investigate a possible diquark bose - einstein condensate at about the nuclear matter density .",
    "our result leads to a non - convential scenario for the stability of the nuclear matter .",
    "we show that the nuclear matter is energetically favored to undergo the diquark bec phase .",
    "we study the emergence of various coexistence patterns by allowing the deconfinement to occur at different critical baryonic chemical potential",
    ". we will show that it is possible that : all three transitions chiral restoration , the deconfinement and the liquid - gas transition are coincident at zero - temperature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we first study the diquark bec dynamics . in section 3 , we introduce the hadronic part of our model and calculate the nuclear and diquark eos . in sections 4 and 5 we investigate the transition between diquark bec phase and nuclear matter phase at high and low baryonic density , respectively .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "with any weak attractive interaction fermions exhibit superfluidity characterized by an energy gap from the bcs pairing mechanism .",
    "( for reviews on color superconductivity , see refs .",
    "however , if the attractive interaction is strong , the fermions can form bound bosonic molecules which condense into the bosonic zero - mode at some critical temperature .",
    "this is called bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "these two different mechanisms are in fact two different physical manifestations with the same order parameter and are expected to be connected by a crossover . in the weak - coupling region at high density the correlation length between two quarks is bigger than the interquark distance or the pair size .",
    "however , one may expect that in strong - coupling region at rather low density due to large pair fluctuations , the correlation length becomes smaller than the pair - size and quark matter undergoes the diquark bec phase  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at the density around the deconfinement transition , the diquark bound states may be the relevant degrees of freedom . here",
    ", we are interested in the physics of low density ( strong - coupling region ) where the bec phenomenon is more relevant . therefore , we assume that the diquarks bound states are already formed and we concentrate on bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the diquark matter has been already studied in ref .",

    "therefore , in our scenario , multifragmentation has more facets than usually .",
    "it also signals a first order phase transition of chiral restoration and deconfinement .",
    "ordinary nuclear matter can then be identified as being in the mixed phase of the first order phase transition : consisting of droplets of diquarks and droplets of nucleons surrounded by empty space .    within this model",
    "we can not directly identify the diquark bec droplets with abnormal nuclei , since color should be gauged if the model is to yield color - singlet droplets .",
    "however , one may tempt to do so , since we know that within nucleons the chiral symmetry is already restored , and the quark density is not zero .",
    "in this case , one arrives at a similar picture to that in the mit bag model . a similar picture of a nucleon as a bag within which chiral symmetry is restored has also been proposed by buballa @xcite , alford , rajagopal and wilczek @xcite and berges and rajagopal @xcite , ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but within quite different models and mechanisms . note that here we can easily choose parameter sets where baryon density in droplets of diquarks is different from the nucleonic droplet @xmath166 .",
    "identifying a diquark droplet with abnormal nuclei is possible for @xmath167 , this may favor a soft eos , see fig .",
    "[ pr1 ] . in this picture , it is also possible to have combined droplets of nuclei and diquarks . a fraction of baryonic charge",
    "can then be delocalized in form of a diquark bec . in this case , diquark concentration within nuclei can be smaller than nuclear matter density @xmath156 .",
    "a possible chemistry of such a mixed matter is beyond the scope of this paper .     for various parameter sets given in tables 1 and 3 .",
    "parameter sets a1 and a2 ( table 2 ) are given with the assumption that the deconfinement takes place at @xmath168 mev , corresponding to baryonic density @xmath169 .",
    "parameter set a2 leads to a coexistence region between nuclear and chirally restored diquark bec matter within @xmath170 .",
    "parameter sets b1 and b2 ( table 3 ) are given with the assumption that the deconfinement takes place right at the nuclear matter saturation point @xmath171 mev .",
    "the gray closed line corresponds to the danielewicz _",
    "_ constraint @xcite .",
    "[ plast],width=7 ]    there are some experimental restrictions coming from the flow analysis in heavy - ion collisions which indicates the preferable theoretical values of pressure in a portion of baryonic density @xmath172 at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this region is shown in fig .",
    "[ plast ] with a gray closed line .",
    "it is important to note that no single eos can simultaneously describe all phenomenological data @xcite .",
    "the area of allowed values does not represent experimental values itself but results from transport calculations for the motions of nucleons in a collision for a given eos . to compare with the flow constraint region , we separate regions of sis ( @xmath173 ) and ags ( @xmath174 ) energies as weak and strong flow constraints . in this figure",
    ", we show the eos we obtained for two cases of early deconfinement ( sets b1 and b2 in table 3 ) and late deconfinement ( sets a1 and a2 ) . in both cases , the produced equations of state pass through the acceptable phenomenological region . for the region @xmath173 the eos",
    "obtained by assuming rather early deconfinement ( sets b1 and b2 in table 2 ) passes through the constraint region .",
    "these equations of state stay outside the acceptable phenomenological region at higher density .",
    "however , because of the diquark ultraviolet cutoff , at higher density of about @xmath175 , the model is not trustworthy .",
    "the current available phenomenological data from heavy ion collisions can not limit the acceptable boundaries on pressure as a function of density below two times the normal nuclear matter density @xcite .",
    "note that the models ( for sets b1 and b2 ) assuming the deconfinement phase transition at relatively low baryonic density can not be precluded by the present flow constraint .",
    "this is in contrast with conclusion made in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the region @xmath174 the eos obtained by assuming late deconfinement passes through the allowed region . for parameter sets a1 and a2",
    ", we assumed that the deconfinement takes place at baryonic density @xmath176 .",
    "for parameter set a2 , the deconfinement phase transition is first - order and it leads to a coexistence region between nuclear and chirally restored diquark bec matter within @xmath177 . for parameter set a1 , the deconfinement phase transition is second - order and there is no coexistence region . note that since we used rather stiff eos for the hadronic side ( set nm ) , in the confined region the nuclear matter eos stays outside allowed region .",
    "this is a general problem of these simple mean - field models and may be improved by adding further meson interactions or potential terms to the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the nuclear matter and its possible phase transition to diquark bec matter at zero temperature .",
    "for the hadronic phase we used a linear @xmath91 model incorporating explicitly the effect of dirac - sea .",
    "for the deconfined phase , we used a complex scalar field theory in terms of diquarks which couple to mesonic fields and repel each other .",
    "nucleon , meson and diquark masses are dynamically generated via spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "our simplified theory does not yet give uniquely the order of a possible deconfinement transition , nor its location .",
    "however , as pointed out , there are indications which suggest that it might be first order and takes places above nuclear matter saturation density . in this paper",
    ", we studied the implication of different choices for the critical deconfinement chemical potential .",
    "our knowledge about the form of matter above deconfinement is still very rudimentary . in this paper",
    ", we studied a possible formation of a diquark bec phase with deconfinement and investigated its implication for the baryonic matter . since we do not know the strength of the diquark - diquark interaction coupling @xmath18 , we investigated possible values for this coupling and possible physical consequences .",
    "we found that it is possible that nuclear matter undergoes a diquark bec phase transition .",
    "our study generally indicates the importance of the diquark bec phenomenon at a rather low chemical potential .",
    "it has been shown within various models that phase transition from hadronic matter to normal quark matter can not occur @xcite . based on our studies , deconfinement to diquark",
    "bec matter seems to be a viable option .",
    "we showed that chiral phase transition is of first order and coincides with deconfinement transition .",
    "the compressibility of the eos depends on the diquark - diquark coupling and the critical deconfinement chemical potential .",
    "we found that an early deconfinement and a weaker diquark - diquark interaction ( or a stronger diquark bec ) soften the eos . assuming that deconfinement already takes place at saturation , we proposed a scenario in which the saturation properties can be described by the diquark bec phenomenon .",
    "in contrast to the standard picture , the vector - meson is not needed and the diquark - diquark interactions provide enough repulsion in order to prevent the collapse of the system .",
    "the eos obtained in this way are rather soft .",
    "in particular , we studied the various coexistence patterns which may emerge if deconfinement takes place at different critical chemical potential .",
    "we showed if deconfinement takes place at higher baryonic chemical potential , due to a first - order phase transition there exists a coexistence region between the hadronic and the diquark matter .",
    "the extension of this region in density depends on the diquark interaction , a weaker diquark - diquark interaction widens this region . for model parameters with heavy diquark in vacuum ( albeit within baryons ) , phase transition to diquark matter becomes of second - order .",
    "we also showed that if deconfinement takes place at about the nuclear matter saturation chemical potential , the ordinary nuclear matter can then be conceived as being in the mixed phase of the first order phase transition , consisting of droplets of nucleons and droplets of chirally restored bec diquarks surrounded by a non - perturbative vacuum .",
    "diquark bose - einstein condensation guarantees a substantial presence of diquarks in the plasma .",
    "a heavy quark - antiquark pair @xmath178 may be converted into a heavy baryon ( @xmath179-diquark ) and exotic unstable pentaquark ( @xmath180-diquark - diquark ) in the presence of the diquark bec",
    ". also the ratio of @xmath181 can be altered in presence of the diquark bec , since @xmath182 contains a scalar diquark while the production of @xmath183 remains unaffected by the presence of the scalar diquarks @xcite .",
    "it will be challenging for incoming facility at gsi / fair to probe a possible signature for the diquark bec matter .",
    "moreover , the diquark bec may alter the compact star cooling behaviour . in principle , two quarks can be converted into a diquark and a pair of neutrinos via the following weak interaction process @xmath184_{\\text{diquark}}+\\bar{\\nu}_{e}+\\nu_{e}$ ] .",
    "these extra neutrinos will be strongly enhanced in the presence of the diquark bec .",
    "this mechanism accelerates the cooling of compact star . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown that the cooling process will be suppressed in the presence of bcs - pairing @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cooling behaviour of compact star may provide a possible signature of existence of the diquark bec matter and bec - bcs crossover .",
    "it is highly desirable to improve our knowledge about the nature of diquark interaction in medium and its possible connections to qcd parameters or some phenomenological inputs .",
    "it is also of interest to investigate the implication of the nuclear - diquark model presented here under neutron stars conditions .",
