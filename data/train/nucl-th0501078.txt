    "the data for @xmath1o have already been analyzed in considerable detail and the enhancement of the left - right asymmetry for @xmath13 ( gev/@xmath5)@xmath6 has been interpreted as evidence for spinor distortion @xcite . here",

    "in this section we outline a series of approximations to the relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) that facilitate exploration of the effects of the dirac sea and comparisons with nonrelativistic approaches ( nrdwia ) .",

    "the overlap @xmath25 between initial and final nuclear states is often called the bound - state wave function and includes the spectroscopic factor . according to standard distorted - wave theory @xcite",
    ", the wave function @xmath26 appears with incoming boundary conditions corresponding to incoming spherical waves in open channels of the @xmath27 system with an outgoing plane wave normalized to unit flux and is related to standard scattering wave functions,@xmath28 , by time reversal .",
    "both wave functions are assumed to satisfy local single - nucleon dirac equations of the form    [ eq : dirac ] @xmath29 \\phi & = & 0 \\\\ \\left [ \\bm{\\alpha } \\cdot \\bm{p } + \\beta(m+s_c ) + ( v_c - e_c)\\right ] \\psi^{(+ ) } & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath30 are four - component dirac spinors , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are scalar and vector potentials , and the subscripts @xmath31 and @xmath5 distinguish between bound ( initial ) and continuum ( final ) states .",
    "the bound - state spinor takes the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spin spherical harmonic and where the orbital and total angular momenta are given by    @xmath34    with @xmath35 .",
    "the momentum distribution is then @xmath36    similarly , the ejectile distorted wave is represented by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are two - component pauli spinors and the boundary conditions are suppressed .",
    "it is often convenient to transform the two coupled first - order radial dirac equations into a single second - order equation @xmath40 \\xi = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a two - component pauli spinor @xcite . here",
    "@xmath42 is the relativistic wave number , @xmath43 is the nucleon mass for the bound state or the relativistic reduced energy for the scattering state , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are central and spin - orbit potentials .",
    "the corresponding dirac wave functions are then given by    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a spinor - distortion operator based upon relativistic effective mass @xmath48 in the presence of dirac scalar and vector potentials , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , the direct pauli reduction method @xcite is based upon a @xmath49 current operator of the form @xmath50 that acts between the pauli spinors for the relativized schrdinger equations  the lower components of the original dirac spinors have been incorporated within the operator . note",
    "that the transpose of the ejectile spinor distortion appears instead of its hermitian conjugate because of its incoming boundary conditions .",
    "thus , one can identify two primary relativistic effects .",
    "first , the darwin potential @xmath51 reduces the interior wave function and generally has a narrowing effect upon the momentum distribution .",
    "although the net effect is to increase spectroscopic factors fit to missing momentum distributions , such effects are similar to those of perey nonlocality factors often used in nonrelativistic models @xcite .",
    "second , the presence of dirac potentials produces dynamical enhancement of the lower components .",
    "some observables , such as @xmath52 , are sensitive to this uniquely relativistic effect through coupling between upper and lower components mediated by the electromagnetic current operator .",
    "several approximations provide useful insight into the roles of various relativistic effects . the effective momentum approximation ( ema )",
    "replaces the momentum operators that appear in spinor - distortion operators by asymptotic kinematics .",
    "thus , the the initial momentum of the struck nucleon , @xmath53 , is identified with the asymptotic missing momentum @xmath54 .",
    "the so - called nosv approximation then uses @xmath55 to eliminate the dynamical enhancement of lower components .",
    "note , however , that the common darwin factor is retained because it has an important effect upon the momentum distribution .",
    "the combined ema - nosv approximation @xcite has the advantage that it can be used with two - component nonrelativistic wavefunctions without using @xmath56 expansions of the current operator .",
    "such wave functions are usually represented by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a perey nonlocality factor @xcite based upon the central binding potential and where @xmath59 fm .",
    "thus , if one replaces the darwin potential in the spinor distortion factor by the perey factor , the ema - nosv approach becomes practically identical to a conventional nrdwia calculation .",
    "furthermore , only the ejectile spin - orbit potential violates factorization of rdwia calculations based upon the ema - nosv approximation .",
    "a more detailed discussion of factorization in these approximations has been given by refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ema - sv approximation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite also replaces momentum operators by asymptotic kinematics but retains the scalar and vector potentials in the spinor - distortion operator , thereby providing an estimate of the effects of dynamical enhancement of the lower components of the dirac spinors by the mean field that is faster and numerically simpler than a full rdwia calculation . when using potentials defined for the schrdinger equation , the darwin potential can be obtained from the spin - orbit potential according to @xcite @xmath60 these representations of the darwin potential are equivalent for rdwia calculations for which @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in terms of @xmath10 and @xmath11 but are not necessarily equivalent for nrdwia calculations where the central and spin - orbit potentials are optimized independently",
    "nevertheless , it is sometimes instructive to perform ema - sv calculations using woods - saxon wave functions fitted to @xmath0 data using nrdwia methods .",
    "however , the difference between @xmath61 based upon @xmath44 and @xmath51 based upon @xmath45 can affect the momentum distribution .",
    "the role of negative - energy contributions of the dirac sea can be evaluated by applying the projection operator @xcite @xmath62 to @xmath25 , @xmath30 , or both .",
    "figure [ fig : pm ] illustrates the effect of positive - energy projection upon the momentum distributions for @xmath63-shell knockout from @xmath1o .",
    "the contribution of lower components is generally small , except near the diffraction minima of the upper component , but can still be very important for observables , such as @xmath52 that emphasize interference between lower and upper components .",
    "the negative - energy contribution is practically negligible for the upper component , but can be appreciable for the lower component .",
    "the negative - energy contribution to the lower component of the @xmath14 state is small for low @xmath64 but increases with @xmath64 , becoming dominant near the diffraction minimum .",
    "by contrast , the negative - energy contribution to the lower component of the @xmath15 state is relatively strong for all @xmath64  in fact , it dominates for small @xmath64 because it has @xmath65 for @xmath66 . for both states",
    "we find that the nosv approximation is very similar , but not quite identical , to the result of positive - energy projection .",
    "we expect the nosv approximation to provide an accurate but much faster estimate of the effect of positive - energy projection , at least for the bound state .    o@xmath67 .",

    "this quantity is especially sensitive to spinor distortion and has the advantages that it is independent of the spectroscopic factor and for modest missing momentum is relatively insensitive to both the momentum distribution for the bound state and the optical potential for the ejectile .",
    "figure [ fig : emabc ] examines the effect of spinor distortion for the bound and/or ejectile wave functions in the context of ema .",
    "except for small spin - orbit effects in the final - state , the ema - nosv approximation nearly factorizes so that @xmath52 is similar to that for a free but moving nucleon .",
    "spinor distortion for the ejectile has relatively little effect at large @xmath7 but is quite important for the bound state wave function , strengthening @xmath52 for @xmath70 mev / c and producing pronounced oscillations at larger @xmath64 that can be attributed to the breakdown of factorization .",

    "the differences between the ema - nosv curves and the nosv curves show that errors due to the effective momentum approximation can be appreciable even without spinor distortion .",
    "the similarity between nosv curves ( without ema ) and those that project upon positive - energy states shows that the dominant effect of spinor distortion arises from coupling to the dirac sea . the fact that the nosv approximation is similar to positive - energy projection",

    "[ fig : pm ] for the momentum distribution .",
    "positive - energy projection is also shown separately for the bound state ( green dash - dotted curves ) and for the ejectile ( magneta dotted curves ) .",
    "thus , comparing the curves labelled project @xmath31 or project @xmath5 with those labelled rdwia , we observe that the sensitivity of @xmath52 to spinor distortion is greater for the bound state than for the ejectile and that positive energy projection is similar to the nosv approximation for both .",

    "@xcite showed that there is an enhancement of this cross section for @xmath74 mev/@xmath5 that can not be reproduced by any of the many variations of the rdwia model that were considered .",
    "therefore , we judge the overall agreement between rdwia calculations and the @xmath52 data for @xmath1o@xmath0 to support the participation of the dirac sea in the bound - state wave function . however , the data are not as precise nor the @xmath64 coverage as complete as we would like",
