    "since the discovery of a large population of actively star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 , identified by their red - shifted lyman continuum breaks at 912 in the rest - frame ( hereafter lbgs , see steidel et al .",
    "1996a , b ) , it has became clear that studying their properties as a whole , as well as their individual spectra , could allow us to obtain information on star formation histories , ages and metallicities of such high redshift objects .",
    "this information can then be used to compare the lbgs to present - day galaxies .",
    "> from hubble deep field and ground - based far - uv spectra , steidel et al .",
    "( 1996a , b ) found that these galaxies are very similar to nearby star - forming galaxies .",
    "the observation of space density , star formation rate , masses , physical sizes and morphologies , led them to the conclusion that the lbgs they discovered could be the progenitors of the spheroidal components of present - day luminous galaxies ( i.e. elliptical galaxies or spiral bulges ) . an argument in favor of ellipticals in clusters as the descendants of lbgs is also given by the strong clustering observed for these objects ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ; steidel et al . 1998 ) . on the other hand , other authors ( lowenthal et al . 1997",
    "; sawicki and yee , 1998 ; sommerville , primack & faber , 2001 ) favor the idea that lbgs can be sub-@xmath2 galaxies or that they are low mass starbursting objects which later merge to form more luminous galaxies .",
    "a crucial test for the nature of lbgs is to measure their masses .",
    "the inferred stellar masses for lbgs are in the range @xmath3 with an average mass of @xmath4 ( papovich et al .",
    "however , these are only lower limits since they measure the young starburst component.the inferred ages for the starbursting populations range from 30 myr to 1 gyr . again , these are lower limits to the ages of lbgs , since it can not be excluded that star formation was occurring even before the observed starburst .    by means of near - ir observations , shapley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) studied 81 , @xmath5 lbgs and found a strong correlation between the inferred star - formation rates and dust extinction : younger galaxies have more dust and higher star - formation rates than older galaxies .",
    "dustier galaxies are also more luminous .",
    "to explain these correlations they proposed an `` evolutionary sequence '' for lbgs , in which the younger galaxies evolve into the older , less reddened and quiescent ones .",
    "they derived ages @xmath6 for lbgs ranging from several myr to 1 gyr , and best - fit star - formation rates in the range @xmath7 with a median @xmath8 .",
    "the total masses in stars derived by integrating the average star formation rate over time are @xmath9 .",
    "they detected also evidences of winds and outflows driven by sne and massive stars , which could enrich the intergalactic medium in metals and energy .    in the following we focus on ms 1512-cb58 , the brightest lbg known so far owing to its gravitationally lensed nature .",
    "this object is at @xmath10 and has a luminous mass of @xmath4 , a star formation rate of @xmath11 ( pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) and an effective radius of @xmath12 ( seitz et al .",
    "1998 ) , for a @xmath13 cosmology . from the study of ms 1512-cb58 pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived also the interstellar medium ( ism ) chemical abundances . in particular",
    ", they concluded that the abundances of o , mg , si , p , s are @xmath14 of their solar values , whereas n , mn , fe and ni are underabundant by a factor of @xmath15 . depletion into dust , which is known to be present in ms 1512-cb58 , probably accounts for some of the fe - peak element underabundances , but this is not likely to be an important effect for nitrogen . they indicate that ms 1512-cb58 is young with an age , less than the typical timescale for the release of n from intermediate mass stars and fe from type ia sne",
    ". they suggest @xmath16 while ellingson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) derived an age younger than @xmath17 myr for the starburst in ms 1512-cb58 by means of a fit of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "finally , an outflow involving the bulk of the ism and proceeding at a speed of @xmath18 seems to be present in ms 1512-cb58 .",
    "this velocity probably exceeds the escape velocity of the galaxy , thus suggesting that ms 1512-cb58 is probably suffering a galactic wind , although firm conclusions on this point are not possible .    models for the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies , which are able to reproduce the observed properties of local ellipticals , assume that most of the star formation in these objects took place several billion years ago and lasted for a period no longer than 1 gyr , at the end of which a strong galactic outflow occurred .",
    "these kinds of models are known as `` supernova - driven galactic wind models '' for ellipticals and were first introduced by larson ( 1974 ) .",
    "supernova - driven wind models including detailed chemical evolution and supernova energetics have been later proposed by arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) and matteucci & tornamb ( 1987 ) and they were aimed at explaining the mass - metallicity relation and the color - magnitude diagram of ellipticals . a multi - zone , more - refined version of these models was then presented by martinelli , matteucci & colafrancesco ( 1988 ) .",
    "these models are also called `` monolithic models '' as opposed to `` hierarchical models '' ( see e.g. kauffmann , 1996 ) , the two main competing pictures for galaxy formation .",
    "the main difference between these two scenarios of galaxy formation is that in the first case ellipticals formed in a short timescale ( 1 - 2 gyr ) and at very high redshifts ( z @xmath19 3 ) and evolved passively afterwards , whereas in the second case galaxies assembled in a hierarchical fashion . in particular , the hierarchical process took place over a large time interval with the consequence of having active star formation until recently in large ellipticals .",
    "the aim of this letter is to test whether the observed chemical properties of lbgs , and in particular of ms 1512-cb58 , can be explained under the assumption that lbgs are normal elliptical galaxies forming at high redshift , and to set independent constraints on the age of this galaxy .",
    "in particular , abundance ratios , especially those between elements formed on different timescales , can set important constraints on the age and the nature of high - redshift objects . in section 2",
    "we describe the chemical evolution model we adopt , in section 3 we present the model results and their comparison with the observed abundances . finally in section 4",
    "some conclusions are drawn .",
    "the elliptical galaxy model we adopted here is a multi - zone model ( martinelli , matteucci & colafrancesco , 1998 ; pipino et al .",
    "2002 ) , in which the gas collapses into the potential well of a dark matter halo at high redshifts ( @xmath20 ) on free - fall timescales .",
    "the star formation rate is very efficient and lasts until the energy injected into the ism by stellar winds and supernovae ( ia , b and ii ) triggers a galactic wind which develops first in the most external regions and later in the more internal ones . as a consequence , while the outer regions are suffering an outflow the inner ones are still actively forming stars .",
    "this kind of model can account for the abundance and color gradients observed in ellipticals ( menanteau , jimenez & matteucci , 2001 ) . generally , after the onset of the galactic wind no star formation is assumed to take place in that particular region , thus supernovae ( sne ) of type ii and ib , which originate from massive stars , no longer",
    "occur whereas sn ia continue to explode until the present time .",
    "in fact , type ia sne are believed to originate from white dwarfs in binary systems .",
    "therefore , the evolution of the galaxy , after the onset of the wind , is dominated by type ia sne which inject into the ism heavy elements ( mostly iron ) and thermal energy .    for the equations of chemical evolution and related details , we direct the reader to the above mentioned papers , while here we recall only the main assumptions of the model .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) is expressed by the classic salpeter ( 1955 ) law : @xmath21 , defined in the mass range @xmath22 . given the uncertainties in the knowledge of the mass of this object we assumed several values for the initial luminous mass ( gas plus stars ) of the galaxy . in this letter",
    "we present three cases , with initial luminous masses @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and effective radii of 0.5 , 2 and 3 kpc ( see matteucci , 1992 ) , respectively .",
    "each galaxy is divided in several concentric shell roughly 0.5 kpc wide .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath26 is related to the gas mass by the following equation : @xmath27 with the efficiency of star formation @xmath28 being in the range 1512 @xmath29 ( see pipino et al .",
    "2002 ) . in this formulation",
    "the star formation rate is maximum at the beginning and then decreases with time , as shown in figure 1 ( where the average star formation rate inside the optical radius of each galaxy is plotted ) , and strongly depends upon the galaxy mass .",
    "the potential energy of the gas is computed by assuming that the galaxy is surrounded by a massive and extended dark matter halo with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 represents the radius of the dark matter core ( bertin et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "the onset of the galactic wind in each zone depends on the time at which the energy , restored by sne , exceeds the gas binding energy . at this time , @xmath33 , all the gas present in the galaxy starts to be lost .",
    "clearly @xmath33 is extremely sensitive to the assumptions made about the feedback between sne and ism .",
    "the detailed calculation of the ism thermal energy due to stellar winds and sne can be found in pipino et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in that paper",
    "we adopted new energetic prescriptions for sne taking into account the most recent results concerning the evolution of a sn remnant in the ism .",
    "in particular , the most crucial parameter in order to compute the amount of energy transferred by a single sn into the ism is the cooling time of the remnant .",
    "this is the time at which radiative losses can not be neglected and most of the energy deposited by the shock wave into the ism , during the adiabatic phase , is lost radiatively . in particular , for type ii supernova remnants we adopted the cioffi , mc kee & bertschinger ( 1988 ) cooling time , which is a function of density and metallicity of the ism . on the other hand , we assumed that sn ia can transfer all of their initial blast wave energy into the ism .",
    "in fact , since type ia sne originate from long living systems , their explosions occur in a medium already heated by snii and therefore the cooling is neglible ( see recchi et al .",
    "2001 ) . under these assumptions",
    "the @xmath0 model develops a galactic wind in the most external region ( roughly 3 kpc from the center ) at @xmath34 and subsequently in the inner region ( 0 - 1 kpc ) at @xmath35 after the major episode of star formation has started .",
    "this situation is certainly compatible with what observed in ms 1512-cb58 , where the outflowing gas is probably located in front of the star forming region at a distance of a few kpc ( pettini et al .",
    "the amount of stars formed at the time of the onset of the external wind is @xmath36 all over the galaxy with the stars being more concentrated towards the center .",
    "the models for @xmath23 and @xmath25 do not seem to reproduce the properties of ms 1512-cb58 since they predict too low and too high star formation rates at any galactic time , respectively , as evident in figure 1 .",
    "they also develop a wind in the most external regions too early and too late , respectively .",
    "by means of our model we can predict the evolution of the abundances in the gas of h , he , n , o , mg , si , fe versus time and metallicity . we adopted different sets of stellar yields in different stellar mass ranges : in particular , for massive stars ( @xmath37 ) the yields of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , for low and intermediate mass stars ( @xmath38 ) the yields of renzini & voli ( 1981 ) and for type ia sne the yields of nomoto et al .",
    "it is worth noting that the model described above has been already compared with the observational properties of local ellipticals ( see pipino et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) , and they reproduce both colors and stellar chemical abundances of normal ellipticals .",
    "in figure 1 we show the predicted and observed star formation rates for ms 1512-cb58 . the value quoted by pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is 40@xmath39 but we can consider a range of possible values of 2080 @xmath39 , given the uncertainties connected with the derivation of the star formation rate . from the comparison between the predictions of the @xmath40 model ( the best model ) and the observed value , we infer an age for the galaxy inside one @xmath41 of @xmath42myr . in figures 2 and 3",
    "we show the predicted [ n / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] and time , respectively , and compare them with the observed ones in ms 1512-cb58 .",
    "the observed values have been corrected for possible dust depletion of fe , although the underabundance of fe - peak elements ( relative to the undepleted s ) can not be entirely due to this effect .",
    "in fact , if that would be the case we should expect the abundances of mg and si to be also depleted , although to a lesser extent , relative to s. this is not what is observed since the ratios of mg and si relative to s are solar , as discussed by pettini et al .",
    "we assumed that roughly half of the total fe mass is hidden in grains ( pettini , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , the observed fe abundance has been increased by roughly a factor of 2 . as figure 2 shows ,",
    "the agreement between model predictions and observations is good for the [ el / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relationships , except for mg which is predicted to be lower than observed .",
    "however , this is expected since all the available yields from massive stars underestimate the solar mg abundance ( e.g. thomas , greggio & bender , 1998 ) . unlike the star formation rate ,",
    "the abundance ratios in the gas are quite insensitive to the galaxy mass , whereas they depend strongly upon the nucleosynthesis , the imf and timescales for the production of the different elements .    in figure 3 , where the abundance ratios are plotted as functions of galactic age and redshift",
    ", we indicate the observational values by dotted lines and see where these lines intercept the predicted curves .",
    "the interception gives an indication of the possible age of ms 1512-cb58 .",
    "for [ mg / fe ] and [ si / fe ] the estimated galactic age can be as low as @xmath43 myr , whereas for the [ n / fe ] ratio the inferred age is @xmath17 myr , in excellent agreement with other independent estimates ( ellingson et al .",
    "from the [ @xmath44/fe ] ratios we can not exclude ages larger than 10 myr but we can exclude ages larger than 300 myr since the ratios at these times are considerably lower than observed .",
    "the high values of the [ @xmath44/fe ] ratios indicate , in fact , that the object is younger than the typical timescale for the enrichment from sne ia ( 0.3 - 0.5 gyr for ellipticals , matteucci & recchi , 2001 ) .",
    "nitrogen is also a good cosmic clock since it is mainly produced by low and intermediate mass stars , although massive stars contribute as well for a small amount of this element . as a consequence ,",
    "n starts to be produced in a non neglible way only after 35 myr ( the lifetime of a 8 @xmath45 star ) while its bulk appears only after 300 myr ( the lifetime of a 2.7 @xmath45 ) .",
    "the ratio of n relative to any @xmath44-element is even more sensitive to age then the [ @xmath44/fe ] ratio and this is because n is mainly a secondary element and therefore sensitive to the overall metallicity .",
    "the age-[fe / h ] relationship predicted by the model for the @xmath40 galaxy suggests that [ fe / h]=-0.85@xmath46 dex ( the dust - corrected iron abundance ) is reached at an age between 20 and 35 myr .",
    "it is worth noting that we obtain a good agreement with observations also for the predicted [ n / o ] ratio which is independent of dust depletion . in fact , we considered the oxygen abundance measured for ms 1512-cb58 by teplitz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( [ o / h]=-0.35 dex ) together with the n abundance by pettini et al . ( 2001 ) and compared the resulting [ n / o ] vs. [ o / h ] and time . in figure 4",
    "we show the two plots for the model galaxies which show that the observed [ n / o ] ratio is compatible with an age between 25 and 30 myr , in good agreement with that estimated from the [ n / fe ] ratio .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that a sn - driven wind multi - zone model for the formation and evolution of an elliptical galaxy with initial luminous mass of @xmath0 , which develops a wind in the most external region ( @xmath47 kpc from the center ) after @xmath48 31 myr , can well reproduce the dust - corrected abundances measured by pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the lyman - break galaxy ms 1512-cb58 .",
    "the fit to the chemical abundances basically suggests that ms 1512-cb58 could be a very young elliptical galaxy with an age @xmath49 myr , experiencing its main starburst and starting to develop an outflow .",
    "independent age estimates ( ellingson et al . , 1996 ) , based on the sed of this galaxy ,",
    "suggest also an age of @xmath48 35 myr , in good agreement with our independent estimate .",
    "the abundance ratios represent a strong constraint since they depend mainly upon the timescales of the production of the different chemical elements . on the other hand ,",
    "the star formation rate depends strongly upon the galaxy mass and suggests a stellar mass of @xmath36 for ms 1512-cb58 and an age of @xmath42 myr , but the observed value is affected by the assumed hubble constant whereas chemical abundances are not , and therefore this age estimate should be considered less certain than that derived from the abundances .",
    "one of the uncertainties involved in this comparison is that the abundance of fe is very probably affected by dust depletion but we do not know exactly how much depletion occurs .",
    "we assumed that the observed fe abundance should be increased by a factor of two and this assumption produces values for the [ @xmath44/fe ] ratios which are consistent with the [ n / fe ] ratio . on the other hand ,",
    "if we took the observed abundances without correction the higher [ @xmath44/fe ] ratios would suggest a younger age than what we have already inferred whereas from the higher [ n / fe ] ratio a much older one , thus leading to a less consistent picture .",
    "moreover , our predicted [ n / o ] vs. [ o / h ] is also in good agreement with the observed values and neither n or o should be substantially affected by dust depletion . in any case ,",
    "dust depletion can only be part of the cause for the measured fe underabundance , which is mostly due to the young age of the galaxy as compared to the typical timescale for fe production by type ia sne in ellipticals ( @xmath50 gyr , as shown by matteucci & recchi , 2001 ) .    in conclusion",
    ", this letter supports the idea that lbgs are young galaxies which could be the progenitors of present day spheroids ( ellipticals and bulges have very similar properties ) , although we can not predict the precise fate of cb58 .",
    "we also like to stress the importance of using abundance ratios as cosmic clocks for dating high redshift objects .",
    "we are grateful to max pettini for his many important suggestions and to an anonymous referee for constructive comments .",
