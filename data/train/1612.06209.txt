    "personal digital devices are involved in a multitude of aspects of our daily life such as working , entertainment , financial management , navigation , and healthcare .",
    "consequently , laptops , tablets , and smartphones are versatile appliances that store and operate on private data . as a protection mechanism",
    ", they are usually accessible with secret information known only by the permissible users .",
    "thus , typical users may have to register and remember at least one password for each device , which is generally related to their personal preferences .",
    "however , the compact size of many of these devices contradicts the deployment of traditional authentication methods .",
    "graphical passwords , such as the 9-dot log - in screen on the android platform , have been gaining more popularity than classical text - based approach due to their convenience on the touch - based interface .",
    "nevertheless , the user is required to remember a static password which is vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is possible to reconstruct the secret pattern from images of the smartphone screen  @xcite . changing the pattern frequently and multi - factor authentication",
    "are countermeasures for this attack strategy but they impose more burdens on the users .",
    "although biometric security mechanisms are increasingly applied for authentication on mobile devices  @xcite , they are naturally limited and difficult to substitute in case of being lost or compromised  @xcite .",
    "wearable cameras allow users to continuously capture videos or images of the environment from the first - person perspective .",
    "they can be mounted to a frame of eyeglasses  @xcite , clipped on a shirt  , or even attached to a wristband  @xcite .",
    "modern wearable cameras are equipped with other sensors ( e.g. accelerometer and gyroscope ) and wireless communication capability ( e.g. wifi or bluetooth ) .",
    "the characteristics of egocentric videos make them a potential candidate for designing authentication schemes on personal devices .",
    "we propose to generate _ always - fresh _ , _ temporal _ and _ personalized _ authentication challenges from images captured by a wearable camera . a set of photos are displayed on the screen and the legitimate user exploits her implicit knowledge on their temporal order to log - in .",
    "our main contributions include :    1 .   the first - ever egocentric video - based authentication system with _ always - fresh _ authentication challenges",
    ". the system features eye - fixation and blurriness - based image filters and thereby flexibly supports different camera systems 2 .   the instrumentation and evaluation of two distinct authentication challenge formats in touch - based user interfaces supporting slide - and - swipe gestures : _ image - arrangement _ and _ image - selection _ , which achieve the mean entry time of 9.77 seconds and 3.10 seconds , respectively .",
    "the measurement is comparable with other memory - based schemes  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite while our mechanism produces _ dynamic _ graphical passwords ( i.e. resistance against shoulder - surfing and smudge attacks ) 3 .   a method to analyse diverse egocentric videos containing object - interaction scenarios and outdoor scenes .",
    "one of our experiment settings spanned three weeks in different european cities 4 .   a threat model and an attacking case study with informed , active and random attackers to prove that the adversaries must spend significantly higher effort than the legitimate users on solving the passwords    our proposed authentication scheme is inspired by the _ implicit memory _ concept , in which previous experiences support the performance of a task without conscious or intentional re - collection of those experiences  @xcite .",
    "one popular practice to investigate implicit memory is the priming procedure .",
    "the investigator first gives the participant a set of stimuli ( e.g. words , objects , or audio ) and then observes the effects in later experiments . in this paper ,",
    "the stimuli are video frames recorded by a wearable camera from the first - person perspective .",
    "the images are combined to form the authentication challenge and the user is required to , for instance , ( a ) rearrange them in the chronological order , or ( b ) mark images that occurred in a specified time window ( e.g. _ mark the image(s ) that did occur yesterday _ ) .",
    "if our system is equipped with an eye - facing camera , fixations are utilized to detect the user s attention , which further increases the memorability of the chosen image for the user . otherwise , we leveraged an image blurriness feature to filter non - informative video frames .",
    "we employ image segmentation and clustering to select highly memorable images and discard repetitive scenes .",
    "two authentication formats are implemented and assessed in different scenarios .",
    "the first asks a user to arrange images into their correct timeline while the second requires the users to pick which events have not happened in a certain period of time .",
    "both formats are graphical passwords and compatible with touch - based interfaces .",
    "since the authentication challenges are formed from what the users encounter during daily activities , the registration phase is implicit and the passwords are changing over time .",
    "figure  [ fig : concept ] illustrates a situation in which the user recalls the chronological order of four images for authentication on a tablet .    in our image - based authentication mechanism , a wearable camera acts as the password generator or security token without explicitly showing authentication codes .",
    "it empowers user authentication not only on mobile devices ( e.g tablets and smartphones ) but also on desktop computers , which do not have sensors for such implicit authentication as gait - based method .",
    "figure  [ figureauthenticationscheme ] depicts an authentication procedure that leverages our proposed mechanism .",
    "after the camera device has authenticated the user and paired with the personal device , images are continuously extracted from first person video . the image - based authentication challenge is initialized by any log - in request on the personal device .    in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we first review related work about recent user authentication schemes and egocentric video summarization methods .",
    "then , we explain the process of selecting images from first - person - view videos to form the authentication challenges , as well as the techniques to remove non - informative and repetitive scenes . finally , our user study results and attacking models are discussed before the paper is concluded .",

    "pattern - based passwords on touch screens have been comfortably adopted for a long time but they can be compromised , for example , by a camera - based smudge attack  @xcite .",
    "thus , several user authentication approaches have been proposed as alternative solutions .",
    "most of them exploited users behaviorial data recorded by wearable sensors such as accelerometer  @xcite  @xcite or camera  @xcite .",
    "a couple of innovative authentication forms were built on implicit memory of past information , such as events  @xcite  @xcite , images  @xcite  @xcite , and installed applications  @xcite .",

    "the authentication process was implemented and evaluated with scaled manhattan distance , scaled euclidean distance , and a single - class support vector machine classifier .",
    "another behaviroral feature is how human eyes react to stimuli . using",
    "the built - in front camera on a smartphone , song  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a novel smartphone authentication mechanism based on eye movements .",
    "they track human eye movement and extract gaze patterns when the user is exposed to visual stimuli on the phone screen .",
    "the release of smartglasses such as jins meme  @xcite or google glass has introduced new opportunities and challenges in user authentication .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite takes advantage of head motions when the user wears smartglasses to recognize the wearer .",
    "we usually move our heads in specific patterns when listening to music .",

    "on the other hand , a pair of smart - glasses equipped with a near - eye screen is able to extend the interface of other devices .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested to employ a numpad layout displayed only on a private near - eye display during the authentication phase .",
    "this approach is a countermeasure against smudge attacks , shoulder - surfing , and camera attacks because the user inputs the password on an almost empty phone interface .",
    "our proposed approach provides this feature because it shows a new challenge for each log - in attempt .",
    "implicit memory on images has been used to facilitate user authentication instead of classical character - based passwords .",
    "dhamija and perrig  @xcite proposed a novel authentication scheme that relied on the human ability of image recognition .",
    "a user first chooses a portfolio of images from a collection presented by a server .",
    "then , to be authenticated , the user must distinguish all selected images with decoy ones .",
    "everitt  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied graphical passwords composed of nine facial images each and the users were authenticated by picking correct faces from distracters .",
    "denning  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite exposed a user to the complete version of images first and then to their degraded counterparts as the authentication challenge .",
    "our proposed approach does not require such priming procedure because the user implicitly perceives the scenes , which are captured simultaneously by the wearable camera . beyond photos displayed by an external system ,",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed to generate the questions for fallback authentication from what users have done with their smartphones",
    ". the information directly comes from the data inside the smartphone .",

    "@xcite had proved the effectiveness of autobiographical authentication through two online questionnaires and one field study .",

    "those movements are distinctive enough to facilitate wearer identification  @xcite . to cope with the vast amount of these images and videos , summarization algorithms are leveraged to retain meaningful and memorable excerpts  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the outcomes are context - dependent multimedia contents that are individualized to a certain user . technically speaking ,",
    "our work is similar to video summarization  @xcite  @xcite or snap point detection  @xcite in terms of extracting important parts of the egocentric videos . in a seminal work , lu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite relied on objects and people that the user interacts with to compute an importance metric .",

    "each image is represented with a holistic descriptor ( or the `` gist '' of the scene ) , local features ( scale - invariant feature transform or sift ) encoded by improved fisher vectors , and values from the penultimate layer of convolutional neural networks .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite combined convolutional neural networks and random decision forests to identify human activities from egocentric images . even though our work focuses on personal surroundings",
    ", we do not define a fixed set of contexts to be identified .",
    "in particular , our image selection method , which relies on segmentation and clustering , aims to group video frames based on their visual characteristics without prior knowledge on the contexts and contents .",
    "the fundamental components of our authentication scheme is built on image analysis techniques .",
    "we first extract the visual descriptors from each frame of the egocentric videos and then select representative frames that the user can easily memorize . in order to do that",
    ", the selected images should contain particular and salient details which help the user to remember their order of appearance .",
    "in this section , we discuss the technical details behind our graphical password generation process .",
    "first , several representations of authentication challenges are recommended , along with their use cases .",
    "second , we present our algorithm to select candidate video frames which are later used to create image - based authentication challenges .",
    "the general idea is that the content in those frames triggers the user s _ implicit memory",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "finally , we describe the features extracted from the frames of egocentric videos .",
    "our framework described in section  [ sec : algorithm ] takes egocentric videos and exports images , which are split into different contexts along the timeline .",
    "these contexts are related to the wearer s activities or locations .",
    "we suggest four authentication schemes where the output images can be employed as shown in figure  [ fig : interface ] ( a sequence of challenges may appear consecutively to harden the challenge ) :    * temporal positioning ( figure  [ fig : interface]a ) : we leverage the moment when the images are captured to produce such _",
    "/ no _ questions as _ `` did you do that ... ? ' ' _ .",
    "* image selection ( figure  [ fig : interface]b ) : the user has to select which events ( scenes ) have not been done ( or has been done yesterday , or similar ) . *",
    "binary arrangement ( figure  [ fig : interface]c ) : the system introduces two images and the user slides to determine the right chronological order .",
    "* multi - image arrangement ( figure  [ fig : interface]d ) : multiple images are shown on the screen randomly and a user arranges them in the right temporal order .",
    "our implementation changes the images whenever a wrong answer is submitted , which makes guessing attacks more challenging .",
    "the aforesaid options are suitable for various types of authentication purposes .",
    "the first three schemes can be used as instant log - in ( one challenge only , depending on the user settings ) .",
    "the last one may require longer duration of consideration , which makes it appropriate for fall - back authentication . in our experiments ,",
    "the _ image - arrangement _ and _ image - selection _ authentication scheme are implemented and evaluated ( others can be extended from these ) .",
    "we propose to choose candidate images for forming the authentication challenges based on two criteria :    * memorability : the image must be as easy to remember for the wearer as possible .",
    "* popularity : the image should not be so common that it can be easily recognized by the adversary .",
    "this can be considered as the uniqueness measure of an image frame .",
    "we aim to select frames that contain clear information ( i.e. there are details that can help the user to infer the chronological order ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : selection ] details the procedure , which consists of several image analysis techniques , including : key frame selection , video segmentation , and scene clustering .",
    "after these processing steps , we form the authentication challenges of two formats : _ image - arrangement _ and _ image - selection_.    * key frame selection * : to reduce the number of images extracted directly from the recorded videos , we retain only key frames . in order to do that",
    ", there are two options : ( i ) selecting frames whenever a fixation appears and ( ii ) retaining images at every specific moment ( e.g. five images per second ) .",
    "the first approach requires data from the eye tracker device , which may not be universally available in all wearable cameras .",
    "the second requires a filtering method and more computational demand .",
    "eye fixations provide essential information of the wearer s visual behavior and have proven useful in video summarization  @xcite because they reveal the user s attention .",
    "for example , there is a higher probability that an image is important and memorable if the wearer s eyes focuses while the image is captured . for the second solution",
    ", we aim to remove unclear video frames caused by body and head movements .",
    "to do that , we calculate the blur information of each frame with the method of crete  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . formally ,",
    "suppose the video consists of @xmath2 frames @xmath3 whose the blurriness is @xmath4 , we select @xmath3 if @xmath5 .",
    "we observed that image sequences produced by two methods were similar and equally useful .",
    "_ image - arrangement _ passwords require users to recall the relative timeline order of images .",
    "thus , the input data is treated as a continuous sequence of videos .",
    "after clustering , we group video frames in such a way that images in the same segment belong to the same cluster .",
    "then , frames which are in the same cluster but appear in different segments ( i.e. repetitive scenes ) are removed from the candidate image set .",
    "this ensures that there is no pair of images describing the same action but is interleaved in time domain by images belonging do a different action , since this can cause confusion for the user to guess the occurrence order .",
    "thus , our algorithm reduces the popularity of repetitive scenes while strengthening the memorability .",
    "_ image - selection _ passwords insist on the moment when the user executes a certain activity or observes a particular scene . in this paper ,",
    "the authentication question _ `` what have you not done today ? '' _ is showed above the images . hence , we supply the clustering algorithm with videos from two consecutive days .",
    "the results are processed in such a way that scenes appear in both days are discarded .",
    "note that in this case we do not remove repetitive segments happening in the same day because they do not influence the user s selection .",
    "this type of passwords can be extended to other temporal scales .",
    "for example , the question _ `` what have you not done after 11:00am ? '' _ separates events based on the recording time .",
    "* segmentation * : after the first phase of extracting key frames , the @xmath6 selected images are then segmented into scenes , based on similarity of visual features , which are described in section  [ sec : features ] .",
    "that means if the difference between two frames is below a certain threshold , they belong to the same segments . in this paper , we define the threshold as the median value of the euclidean distance between two consecutive ( representative ) frames in the feature space .",
    "suppose @xmath7 is the function that extracts the feature vector from each video frame , we define the threshold as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the euclidean distance function .",
    "we choose this threshold instead of the pairwise distances between every pair of frames for its lower computational complexity ( @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the preliminary analysis of our experiments proved that it produced better segmentation results .",
    "this parameter , as well as the aforementioned blurriness limit , is adapted to the personalized videos .",
    "we experimented with cosine similarity but it did not improve the result in our case .",
    "in addition , the user is able to specify the timeline in which videos are analysed to form the authentication challenges .",
    "thus , even within a specific user s clip collection , the values of these thresholds depends only on the videos themselves .    *",
    "clustering * : the next step is to cluster similar segments into groups of similar scenes .",
    "the number of clusters is not determined beforehand because there is no knowledge on which activities are repetitive .",
    "to fulfil this requirement , we use _ density - based spatial clustering of applications with noise _ ( dbscan )",
    "@xcite , which groups together points that are in a neighborhood .",
    "the algorithm requires two parameters : the distance threshold to group similar images and the minimum number of images in each cluster .",
    "the similarity threshold of images is determined by analysing the difference of consecutive frames .",
    "we use the same threshold value for both segmentation and clustering .",
    "the second parameter allows us to discard _ noise _ images , which pop up abruptly and are _ non - informative_. some example video frames that are removed by this method are shown in figure  [ fig : filtered ] .",
    "they are blurred , dark or do not contain interesting objects ( almost empty ) .",
    "* grouping & challenge generation * : the challenge is generated from the respective clusters as depticed in figure  [ fig : segmentcluster ] .",
    "we have considered two distinct authentication challenge formats as detailed in figure  [ fig : details ] . to generate an _ image - selection _ authentication challenge ,",
    "scenes occurring in both days are eliminated while repetitive activities in the same day still appear in the final password .",
    "the lower part of the figure sketches one _ image - arrangement _",
    "password for each day , in which similar images belonging to different segments are grouped into the same cluster .",
    "such photos are not selected to form the authentication challenge .",
    "note that the selected images belong to different contexts ( e.g. on bus , at the train station , hiking , playing volleyball , having dinner , etc ) . when generating the graphical passwords , we select one representative frame from one scene ( i.e. segment ) to guarantee the distinguishability of the images .              we aim to extract both global and local characteristics of each video frame .",
    "the feature vector must therefore be able to describe the appearance of the whole scene as well as the local sub - regions and individual objects .",
    "to fulfil this requirement , we combine census transform histogram ( centrist ) and the pyramid of histograms of orientation gradients ( phog ) to form the representation of our first - person - view images .",
    "we perform principle component analysis to reduce the number of dimensions . in the experiments",
    ", we achieved the best result when each feature vector contains @xmath12 variables .",
    "the final feature vectors are then used to split the video frames into temporal sequences and cluster images that have similar content .",
    "figure  [ fig : features ] shows an example image , its intermediate representations , and excerpts of its visual descriptors .",
    "* centrist * :  @xcite generates a holistic representation of a scene by capturing the structural characteristics and the rough geometry .",
    "census transform compares the intensity value of each pixel with those of its neighborhood .",
    "if the value is less than one of its neighbors , the corresponding location is assigned a bit 0 , otherwise , a bit 1 is used .",
    "then , eight bits in the neighborhood are concatenated and converted to a base-10 number called census transform value for the central pixel .",
    "after all pixels of the image are evaluated , the centrist descriptor is constructed from a histogram of census transform values . a spatial pyramid scheme is applied to obtain a robust global representation .",
    "an image is split into ( sliding ) blocks in different levels . in each block , the centrist descriptor is extracted independently . finally , all descriptors ( i.e. histograms ) of all blocks at all levels are aggregated to form the representation of the whole image .",
    "* phog * : to complement the above global descriptors , we compute the phog feature  @xcite . with this descriptor , bosch  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite aimed to represent an image through its local shape and the spatial relations of the shape .",
    "they divide an image into rectangular regions at several resolutions and calculate the distribution ( histogram ) of edge orientations in each region .",
    "each bin of the histogram contains the number of edges whose orientations belong to a specified angular range .",
    "then , the concatenation of histograms from all regions becomes the descriptor of the image .",
    "in this section , we present our case studies to verify the feasibility of the approach .",
    "the videos were collected by wearable cameras , then transmitted to a computer for frame extraction and password generation .",
    "after that , the wearer solved the passwords on other devices while the number of attempts and the entry time were collected for further analysis .",
    "we assume that all involved components ( e.g. wearable cameras , personal devices , processing servers , etc ) are securely connected or paired in advance , using wired or wireless communications .",
    "we performed experiments in three scenarios under various conditions :    * a pilot study with two wearable cameras to familiarize the users ( see figure  [ fig : device ] for the mounting positions ) * an object - interaction setting in an office * a daily condition study in which subjects wore the camera during several days    some images extracted from our video clips are shown in figure  [ fig : dataset1 ] .",
    "those photos contain diverse details due to the subjects activities , body movements , locations , weather , light intensity , and scene appearance .",
    "this study aims to introduce our authentication concept and verify its feasibility .",
    "the _ image - arrangement _ scheme is leveraged in these experimental sessions .    we employed the headset produced by pupil labs  @xcite to acquire the world and eye videos .",
    "this device comprises two cameras on a frame : the _ world _ camera to capture the scene from the user s point - of - view and the _ eye _ camera to record videos of one user s eye . along with the hardware , a software package",
    "is provided with such functions as : camera control , eye tracking and fixation detection , visualization , etc .",
    "we attached a laptop to the headset through a usb connection in order to store both video streams simultaneously since this is currently not supported with the mobile app .",
    "figure  [ fig : head ] shows our device installation for the data collection phase .",
    "the video resolution is reduced from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "an application was developed with matlab   in order to display the authentication challenges .",
    "each challenge , i.e. graphical password , consists of four video frames which are selected from distiguishable temporal segments ( for example , see  figure  [ fig : segmentcluster ] ) .",
    "the users clicks on each frame to form a chronological sequence of images .",
    "each image stems from one temporal segment and contains visually - diverse information . due to the clustering procedure",
    ", we do not select repetitive actions , which may cause confusion for the user when selecting the right chronological order . in each challenge , the user needs to answer @xmath15 image - based authentication challenges consecutively .",
    "all passwords are generated from the same video source but the images are selected randomly from different segments .",
    "the number of attempts and the entry time are collected for each password .",
    "we recruited five subjects ( two females , two wearing glasses ) to participate in two sessions .",
    "the first one aimed to make the users familiar with the system while the second encouraged the users to discover the environment and perform more activities .",
    "the duration of videos in the former is @xmath16 minutes and @xmath17 minutes in the latter .",
    "the subjects in our experiments wore the device and went to different locations .",
    "we suggested possible places to visit but the subjects did not need to follow any specific routine .",
    "after that , the system asked them to organize four images into the right chronological order .",
    "the number of attempts and the entry time are recorded for further analysis .",
    "since the entry time includes the unsuccessful log - in trials , we measure the time until a subject solves a password successfully regardless the number of attempts , which is equivalent to the _ total time _ concept proposed by everitt  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "we analysed the users effort in the second session because the first one only introduced our system to the subjects .",
    "the average number of attempts and entry time were 1.65 times and 19.07 seconds , respectively .",
    "particularly , in our experiments , the fastest time that a user solved an authentication challenge is 3.79 seconds .",
    "these results indicate that our approach can be utilised to generate the visual authentication challenges from egocentric videos .",
    "next , we aim to improve the usability because the matlab - based prototype only supports mouse - click interaction .",

    "it changes the challenge ( i.e. new images ) if the user submits a wrong arrangement .",
    "we conducted the same evaluation process and achieved better results .",
    "specifically , the mean entry time is 9.79 seconds and the mean number of attempts is 1.87 .",
    "table  [ tab : pilot ] summarizes the user effort in the matlab - based and web - based interface for comparison .",
    "there is an observation that the web - based interface allows more attempts but less time - consuming . due to more variation in the two - day video clips , the user effort may be higher but the touch - based interface decreases the entry time significantly .",
    "thus , we customized this kind of user interface for other experiments .",
    ".user effort on the matlab - based ( mouse - click interaction ) and web - based ( slide - and - swipe interaction ) interface in our pilot study .",
    "the numbers in brackets are standard deviation .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     furthermore , as an effort to improve the usability , we investigated another daily condition case involving four subjects ( two females , two with glasses )",
    ". each of them wore the camera in two consecutive days .",
    "then , they tried to solve the _ image - selection _ authentication challenges whenever they wanted . if we consider the password length @xmath18 images with @xmath19 valid images , the mean entry time is 4.67 seconds ( standard deviation 3.17 ) and the mean number of clicks is 2.92 ( standard deviation 1.89 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in this case , we studied only the eight - image passwords because they had a balanced ratio of valid and invalid images .",
    "when the users answered the challenges , we quantified the correctness of the current solution based on the number and position of chosen valid photos .",
    "table  [ tab : threshold ] shows the user effort in terms of the average entry time ( seconds ) and number of clicks to achieve answers 50% , 75% , and 100% of similarity comparing with the correct image - based authentication challenges .",
    "based on the observation , the users can be allowed to configure our system as a trade - off between security and usability , e.g. an input can be considered as _ valid _ if it has 75% of similarity with the correct passwords .",
    "we consider this technique as an approach to reduce the entry time and the number of clicks .",
    "in contrast to other image - based authentication schemes where images are selected from a _ fixed _",
    "collection  @xcite  @xcite , our photo collection comes from ever - changing egocentric videos .",
    "therefore , our approach is resistant to smudge attacks and shoulder surfing .",
    "it is further not possible to steal the password from the user ( as it is , for instance , with biometric - based schemes ) , since the authentication challenge is never the same and , in particular , the user is not aware of the authentication challenge ahead of time .",
    "this _ enrollment phase _ proceeds implicitly without the user s intervention .",
    "thus , generally speaking , the entropy of the graphical password space depends on the user s personal activities , i.e. contextual information . if few different activities are conducted , the complexity of the authentication challenges generated degenerates as variation is low .",
    "in such case ( when very similar image features are observed ) , we suggest that either the history considered for password generation is extended , or fallback authentication is used . this is useful also to reduce frustration for the legitimate user as we have observed in our experiments a tendency that low - variance behaviour might occasionally result in difficult to solve authentication challenges in which the exact order of similar and spatially close activities is hard to recall .",
    "a natural threat for our authentication scheme is an adversary following the user , remembering visual context , and bringing the locked device in her possession . to successfully answer the image - based passwords , she or he is then required to know thoroughly the user s actions and positions . while this is possible , we remark that it is difficult to achieve undetected , especially for a stranger , because the user may spend time in a personal space ( e.g. a private office ) .",
    "we remark that this issue has been addressed also by shiraga  _ et al . _ in  @xcite .",
    "the authors deployed two cameras on a back - pack to capture what happens behind the wearer when walking . furthermore , even if the adversary obtains knowledge on the daily routine of the user , it is still challenging to guess the generated passwords without tracking the user suspiciously .",
    "we have investigated these cases in a user study ( see the box below ) .",
    "another case is that the adversary has both the eyeglasses and the locked device in her possession for a duration which is long enough to generate an authentication challenge . in this case",
    ", the image - generated authentication challenges would pose no protection .",
    "however , we suggest that the protocol is implemented together with a framework to verify the eyeglasses wearer ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figureauthenticationscheme ] ) , so that the different user would be detected .",
    "we therefore believe that this threat is easily mitigated for our system .",
    "this paper presents a novel user authentication mechanism which takes advantage of egocentric videos recorded by wearable cameras . we explain how to select video frames that are possible to discriminate in the timeline .",
    "those chosen images contain visual details that are meaningful to the users .",
    "two visual descriptors , centrist  @xcite and phog  @xcite , are aggregated to characterize an photo .",
    "we explain the selection criteria and implement the algorithm which is based on image segmentation and clustering techniques .",
    "they are organized into two graphical password schemes in different time scales : _ image - arrangement _ and _ image - selection_. in order to authenticate in the first scheme , an image sequence must be arranged into their chronological order . in this case , the chosen images belong to short and instant activities rather than daily routines .",
    "the second scheme leverages human memory on when specific events occur . to log - in ,",
    "users are required to identify which scenes have not appeared or which activities have not happened at a certain moment . to evaluate our proposed approach ,",
    "the user study is performed in three settings , including daily activities , object - interaction actions , and traveling scenarios :    * the _ image - arrangment _ scheme has the average entry time of 9.77 seconds in the object - interaction scenario and 9.79 seconds in two - day experiments * the _ image - selection _ scheme achieves the average entry time of 3.10 seconds in a three - week study and 4.67 seconds in two - day experiments        r.  biddle , s.  chiasson , and p.  van  oorschot , `` graphical passwords : learning from the first twelve years , '' _ acm comput .",
