    "the first part of the theorem  [ generalpar ] follows from @xcite . for the second part we are going to reconstitute some of the details started in the proof of the particular case : @xmath6 .",

    "this means that @xmath10 must divide @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "so , we need to look at the the following system of linear equations in @xmath25 and @xmath26 :    @xmath45    by the kronecker - capelli theorem this linear system of equations has a solution if and only the rank of the main matrix is the same as the rank of the extended matrix . since @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( one can check these calculations based on the definitions in ( [ paramtwo ] ) )",
    "then the rank of the main matrix is two and the rank of the extended matrix is also two because its determinant is @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that ( [ fsystem ] ) has a unique real ( in fact rational ) solution in @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we want to show that this solution is in fact an integer solution . solving for @xmath26 from each pair of equations in ( [ fsystem ] ) we get    @xmath50    because @xmath12 , there exist integers @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 such that @xmath54",
    ". then one can see that    @xmath55    next , from ( [ n2 ] ) we observe that in order for @xmath26 to be an integer it is enough to prove that @xmath10 divides @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "hence we calculate for example @xmath56 in more detail : @xmath59 from ( [ eqfortp ] ) we see that @xmath60 .",

    "therefore it must be a prime of the form @xmath72 .",
    "hence @xmath73 is still a sum of two squares .    in the proof of theorem  13 in @xcite",
    "one can choose @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the extra condition that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are divisible by @xmath70 .",

    "this implies that @xmath83 must divide @xmath56 . in a similar way we can show that @xmath83 divides @xmath57 and @xmath58 and",
    "so from ( [ n2 ] ) we see that @xmath26 is a rational with denominator having @xmath70 as a multiple .",
    "similar arguments will give us that @xmath25 is of the same form .",
    "the triangle having the coordinates as in ( [ paramone ] ) with these @xmath25 and @xmath26 will give the length    @xmath84    but this whole construction can be repeated for @xmath7 or @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 and we obtain that    @xmath85    for some rational numbers @xmath86 , @xmath87 with denominator having multiple @xmath88 for example . since @xmath89 we see that @xmath90 must be an integer . therefore    @xmath91    on the other hand if @xmath92 and @xmath70 divides @xmath10 we can see that    @xmath93    we also know that @xmath94 and hence @xmath95 .",

    "but @xmath98 ( mod @xmath97 ) too and then @xmath99 ( mod @xmath97 ) which combined with ( [ key ] ) gives    @xmath100    because we must have @xmath101 , ( [ last ] ) implies that @xmath70 divides @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath69 is a prime that has exponent one in the decomposition of @xmath70 then ( [ last ] ) gives in particular @xmath103 ( mod @xmath69 ) and so @xmath69 must divide @xmath102 . if the exponent of @xmath69 in @xmath70 is two , then ( [ last ] ) in particular implies that @xmath102 is divisible by @xmath69 but then @xmath104 ( mod @xmath105 ) which implies @xmath106 divides @xmath102 .",
    "inductively if the exponent of @xmath69 in @xmath70 is @xmath107 then this must be true for @xmath102 too .",
    "hence we must have @xmath70 a divisor of @xmath102 so @xmath108 .",
    "now we can go back to ( [ finalstep2 ] ) and observe that we can rewrite it as    @xmath109    where @xmath110 .",
    "now we observe that the left hand side of ( [ back ] ) is a multiple of @xmath70 since @xmath22 and @xmath102 are .",
    "after simplification with @xmath70 this will show that @xmath73 must divide in fact @xmath111 and so @xmath10 divides @xmath56 .",
    "similar arguments can be used to deal with the other cases .",
    "hence @xmath26 must be an integer and so should be @xmath25 .",
    "changing the variables as in ( [ hexagonaltransform ] ) , one of the corresponding triangles given by ( [ paramone ] ) is going to match with the triangle @xmath112 .",
    "* remark : * one can see that the condition on @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be divisible by @xmath70 is implied by asking only that the numbers in ( [ paramtwo ] ) be integers .",
    "indeed , given such a choice of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , they will define by ( [ paramone ] ) , in which @xmath113 and @xmath114 , an equilateral triangle with integer coordinates . according to the proof of theorem  [ generalpar ] , @xmath115 and @xmath116 must be divisible by @xmath70 .",
    "this implies that @xmath22 and @xmath23 must be multiples of @xmath70 .",
    "therefore any parametrization as in the theorem  [ generalpar ] is unique up to the transformations ( [ hexagonaltransform ] ) .",
    "the calculations of the @xmath0 for all @xmath32 gave us enough data to be able to extrapolate the graph of @xmath117 as shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the function we used to extrapolate is of the form @xmath118 having clearly @xmath7 as limit at infinity .",
    "then we made it agree with @xmath119 on three points .",
    "that gave us @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "numerically then we discovered that the average of @xmath123 over all values of @xmath124 is approximately @xmath125 .",
    "the graph of the  derivative \" of @xmath0 ( figure  [ derivative ] ) is almost like the graph of @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "the third difference of @xmath0 as represented in figure  [ 3rdder ] seems to bring a chaotic flavor to this sequence and it is saying in a certain sense that no simple formula for @xmath0 can exist .",
