    "in our paper @xcite we described an upgrade of the monte carlo generator tauola using the results of the resonance chiral lagrangian ( @xmath3 ) for the @xmath2 lepton decay into the most important two and three meson channels .",
    "the necessary theoretical concepts were collected , numerical tests of the implementations were completed and documented . finally , we presented strategy for fitting experimental data and the systematic uncertainties associated with the experimental measurement .",
    "however , there was and remain until now , an obvious limitation due to the fact that we are using one - dimensional projections of the invariant masses for a multi - dimensional distribution .",
    "the first comparison @xcite of the @xmath3 results for the @xmath4 mode with the babar data @xcite , did not demonstrated a satisfactory agreement for the two pion invariant mass distributions . with the recent availability of the unfolded distributions for all invariant masses constructed from observable decay products for this channel @xcite , we found ourselves in an excellent position to work on model improvement for the @xmath4 mode .",
    "we would like to stress here that the choice of the three pion mode is not accidental .",
    "the kinematical configuration is complex and the three pion mode has the largest branching ratio among the three meson decay modes .",
    "moreover , this decay mode together with the decays into two pions , which are much easier to model , are a useful tool for spin - parity analysis of the recently discovered higgs boson @xcite through its di-@xmath2 decays @xcite .",

    "we present modifications to the currents previously prepared by us  @xcite .",
    "we give a brief motivation for the choice of selected extensions . in section 3 ,",
    "we present numerical results and we discuss available options .",

    "in the present paper we have documented modification of the resonance chiral theory currents for @xmath97 decay of reference @xcite , necessary for agreement with the experimental data .",

    "in addition , this channel is important for higgs spin - parity studies through the associated di-@xmath2 decays .",
    "previously missing contribution from the @xmath1 resonance was added to our currents and final state coulomb interactions were taken into account . as a result , we improved agreement with the data by a factor of about eight .",

    "this is the first case when agreement for a non - trivial @xmath2 decay channel was obtained between the babar data @xcite and the theoretical model .",
    "these comparisons allow for future precision tau decays physics studies @xcite .",
    "the agreement with data has improved , mainly , due to the inclusion of the @xmath1 meson , which is outside the @xmath3 approach . in tables",
    "[ tab : fit ] and [ tab : fit - results ] , it can be seen that the value of @xmath98 is at the boundary .",
    "this appears to be the result of a numerical instability in the phenomenological description of the @xmath1 caused by the correlation between the @xmath99 in the exponential decay , equation 6 , and with width of the breit - wigner , equation 4 .",
    "this problem can only be resolved with a better parametrization of the @xmath1 which is currently not available to us . without the @xmath1 contribution",
    "the @xmath3 demonstrates only slightly better agreement with data than the cleo model @xcite , fig.1 .",
    "therefore , we can not exclude that fits of similar good quality could be obtained if further work was done on the cleo model approach . ] .",

    "@xcite . ] .",
    "in contrast , the phenomenological approximation , as it was done at cleo , do not do that @xcite .",
    "we will come back to this point in our future analysis of the @xmath100 modes .",
    "even though this work is based on one dimensional unfolded experimental distributions , we think that it is an important step forward .",
    "we have enriched our fitting arrangements , to profit from the availability of invariant mass distributions .",
    "use of unfolded distributions and our technical arrangements substantially improved the speed of our fitting .",
    "we have implemented solutions based on parallel calculations .",
    "the @xmath3 currents are ready for comparison with data for other @xmath2 decay channels and for work when unfolded multi - dimensional distributions are used .",
    "this may constrain the set of parameters obtained from fit to the @xmath0 channel , which features strong correlations .",
    "there exist other solutions ( local minima ) for the parameters which give somewhat worse agreement with the experimental data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for the results of final fit the minuit hesse method evaluates some elements of the correlation matrix to surpass 0.9 .    an alternative approach , using linear approximation of the dependence on fitted parameters ( described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is pursued independently @xcite .",
    "it may become useful in later phases of the project .",
    "it has an advantage that it allows for experimental cuts to be introduced into the fitted distributions .",
    "it is , however , much slower and features instabilities if the choice of the fitted function is poor .",
    "it provides , however , independent test of our numerical methods used in the paper . in the present paper a simpler fitting method has been used as the unfolded distributions from experimental data are now available @xcite .",
    "discrepancies in the high mass region of the @xmath101 invariant mass indicate the possibility of missing resonances in our @xmath3 approach .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of additional resonances , more specifically the @xmath78 and @xmath79 , by cleo in @xcite . around @xmath102 mev",

    "although we could add phenomenologically the contribution of these resonances to the amplitude , we prefer not to do it at the moment to keep a compromise between the number of parameters , the stability of the fit and the amount of experimental data",
    ". we also comment below on the need to include the contribution of the @xmath87 resonance .",
    "it should be pointed out that the necessity of the @xmath1 in our model may be an artifact caused either by neglecting the dynamics associated with these additional resonances parameters are unconstrained in the fit , they usually leave the expected physical range hints to such a possibility .",
    "this is especially highlighted by the fact that even in our results , parameter @xmath108 is at its upper limit ( see table [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "fit results for @xmath1 parameters seem to depend on minuscule changes in its setup , this may also support conjecture of unphysical nature of @xmath1 contribution to the currents or to its inaccurate modeling . ] or by the crudeness of our @xmath1 parameterization .",
    "the largest discrepancies between data and the fitted distribution , which are responsible for a significant part of the total @xmath109 , are observed in the 3@xmath110 invariant mass distributions . the slope and shape of the disagreement in the 3@xmath110 invariant mass spectra , in particular around @xmath111 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipipi ] , indicates the possibility of interference between @xmath112 and its excited state @xmath87 .",
    "the disagreement in the low mass regions around @xmath113 gev and below could be the result of a bias in the fit caused by leaving out the additional resonance .",
    "although we currently restrict ourselves to the lowest axial - vector resonance , @xmath112 , in future analysis of multi - dimensional distributions we are going to include the @xmath87 in the same way as it was done for the @xmath114 to test our hypothesis the constant width approximation can be used for this resonance . ] .",
    "we prefer not to do this at the moment because the improvement of the fit on the peak and tail regions in the three - meson invariant mass distribution will come again together with an increase of the fit instability and a growth of the correlations between the ( larger number of ) fit parameters . lacking the complete multi - dimensional distributions",
    "it is advisable to proceed this way at present .",
    "cleo has also suggested a hint of a possible contribution of the pseudo - scalar resonance @xmath115 , which they have excluded at the @xmath116 level with a 90% cl@xcite .",
    "this is below the current sensitivity of our fit .",
    "finally , we note that previous dedicated studies within the @xmath3 framework @xcite did not obtain an improved description of the data when including the chiral logarithms @xcite .",
    "this question could also be readdressed when more exclusive data will become available .",
    "this paper represents a significant improvement in the agreement between our model and the data .",
    "the resulting fit parameters are substantially improved and are reasonable from the point of view of internal consistency of @xmath3 .",
    "the obtained value for the @xmath65 mass can be used for the future theoretical study .",
    "predictions for the @xmath28 are obtained from the ones for @xmath4 directly with the help of isospin symmetry without any modifications except the part of @xmath1 contribution which was adapted and constraints from cleo were used . then , our current results with the partial branching ratio , which is @xmath117 higher than the pdg result , is reasonable for our somewhat simplistic assumption .    on technical side ,",
