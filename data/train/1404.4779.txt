    "multiterminal setups offer a great way to explore nonlocal quantum effects as well as entanglement in condensed matter devices , attracting both experimental and theoretical attention . recently",
    ", these efforts have focused on all - superconducting hybrid structures , involving quantum dots or metallic islands connected to multiple superconducting leads.@xcite in particular , the prediction of nonlocal quartet production,@xcite that is the emission of spatially correlated pairs of cooper pairs , opens new perspectives in the realization of electronic entanglers .    motivated by this , a recent work @xcite considered an all - superconducting bijunction consisting of a central superconductor coupled via gate - controllable quantum dots to two lateral voltage - biased superconductors .",
    "it uncovered the presence of a coherent transport mechanism away from equilibrium , manifesting as multipair phase - coherent josephson resonances in the current , appearing on top of the usual local dissipative transport of quasiparticles .",
    "similarly , experimental work performed on a three - terminal voltage - biased josephson junction involving a central t - shaped metallic region revealed features in the electronic subgap transport consistent with the production of nonlocal quartets @xcite though an unequivocal signature is still lacking at the moment . in this context ,",
    "alternative ways of detecting such nonlocal multipair processes are highly desirable , in particular in the coherent dissipationless regime , a route that could be provided by an interferometric setup , such as a squid .",
    "a superconductor quantum interference device , or squid , consists in a superconducting loop , defining two paths each interrupted by a josephson junction . as a direct consequence of phase coherence ,",
    "the cooper pairs flowing along these two paths interfere , in a way that is controlled by the magnetic flux through the loop . in a recent achievement of molecular electronics , a carbon nanotube",
    "squid has been realized experimentally .",
    "@xcite there , the two constitutive josephson junctions are both made of a nanotube quantum dot , allowing to tune their transparency with the help of an external gate voltage , therefore providing a new generation of versatile sensors .",
    "interestingly , similar carbon nanotube ( or nanowire ) devices have been used as cooper pair beam - splitters , @xcite a source of entangled electron pairs@xcite where the quasi one - dimensional nanostructure is contacted to a central superconducting source and two metallic drains .",
    "these rely on a specific nonlocal process , referred to as car for crossed andreev reflection,@xcite which amounts to separating the constituents of a cooper pair into spatially distinct contacts ( provided they are within a distance set by the coherence length ) .",
    "it is therefore only natural to devise a setup bringing together the interferometric properties of the squid with the nonlocal aspects associated with car processes .",
    "such a setup could be constructed from a carbon nanotube with readily accessible technology , as illustrated by the many examples of multiterminal nanotube - based devices now available.@xcite    in this paper , we propose such a device , dubbed a bisquid , consisting of two twinned squids , where the superconducting contact which emits the multiple pairs is common to both loops in order to reveal multipair processes through interferometry .",
    "the two loops realize a three - terminal structure made of a single carbon nanotube ( or nanowire ) contacted to three superconducting leads ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reallife ] ) , delimiting four quantum dots which are controlled by external gate voltages .",
    "the device is ideally operated by fixing the total current flowing through , which we express in terms of the magnetic fluxes piercing the two loops .",
    "recently , a two - terminal squid geometry involving two loops was realized experimentally using superconductor - normal metal - superconductor junctions.@xcite while somewhat similar in spirit to the present proposal , this setup was specifically designed for sensing applications rather than to explore nonlocal effects .",
    "it shows , however , that not only the actual realization of these systems is within our grasp but also that such superconducting nanodevices constitute an active field of research .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : setup ] , we introduce the setup and present a first simple phenomenological approach .",
    "we then derive the expression for the critical current in section [ sec : micro ] , starting from a microscopic description of the setup .",
    "section [ sec : critical ] is devoted to our results , where we show and analyze the dependence of the critical current on the external magnetic field , and comment on the robustness of the observed features .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : competing ] , we explore the competing effects which might spoil the expected signatures of pure car processes , before concluding in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the bisquid setup is presented in fig .  [ fig : setup ]",
    ". it basically amounts to twinning two nanotube - based squids by a common central electrode whose width is smaller than the coherence length , in order to support nonlocal andreev scattering processes . and @xmath0 are chosen wide enough so as to avoid nonlocal effects . ] a carbon nanotube ( or nanowire ) is contacted with three superconducting electrodes , referred to as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "this defines four quantum dots , labeled @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , controllable via nearby electrostatic gates .",
    "the area of the two resulting squid loops ( denoted @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively ) are chosen different , so as to ensure that electrons feel different magnetic fluxes depending on the loop they flow through .    in order to make the upcoming discussion as clear as possible , it is important to properly define the various superconducting phases involved in this setup .",
    "a phase @xmath9 is attributed to the central superconducting finger , while the other two superconducting electrodes are characterized respectively by a phase @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic fluxes through the two loops @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the surface area enclosed by loop @xmath15 .",
    "it follows from flux quantization that the phase differences seen by each quantum dot josephson junction , are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the flux quantum .",
    "the bisquid is controlled by fixing the total current @xmath18 measured from the common output , which depends on all of these four phase differences , or alternatively on the superconducting phases @xmath10 and @xmath11 as well as the magnetic fluxes through the loops @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( from this point on , we set @xmath21 as the reference for the superconducting phases ) .",
    "a key quantity of interest for such a superconducting interferometer is the flux - dependent critical current , i.e. the maximum dissipationless current which can flow through the device , defined here as @xmath22 out of the four quantum - dot based junctions , only @xmath3 and @xmath5 are coupled by nonlocal effects , leading to signatures in the critical current involving specific combinations of the external fluxes , which can be revealed through a simple phenomenological approach .    in the limit of low transparency",
    ", we can perform a simple perturbative treatment in the cooper pair tunneling .",

    "however , one must distinguish between two different contributions .",
    "local processes , amounting to two pairs crossing any given junction , involve twice the phase difference seen by each quantum dot : @xmath25.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition to these , the present device allows the possibility for nonlocal processes , and one thus needs to consider the so - called pair cotunneling and quartet supercurrents.@xcite the latter corresponds to the splitting of two correlated pairs from @xmath2 into @xmath1 and @xmath0 , which leads to a josephson - like current - phase relationship involving both the phase difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and the one between @xmath2 and @xmath0 , namely @xmath26 due to the exchange process intrinsic to quartet emission , we expect @xmath27 to be negative.@xcite this nonlocal process relies on crossed andreev reflection through @xmath2 , which naturally coexists with normal transmission through the central superconducting electrode without electron - hole conversion , the so - called elastic cotunneling .",
    "it follows that the quartet process comes with a similar partner corresponding to the exchange of a pair from @xmath1 to @xmath0 via double elastic cotunneling through @xmath2 , therefore contributing to the supercurrent as @xmath28 where the various current scales introduced above satisfy @xmath29 , as a consequence of the low transparency of the junctions .    combining eqs .",
    "though , one obtains the following expression for the total critical current , up to second order in the pair tunneling @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the magnetic flux through loop @xmath15 , in units of the flux quantum .",
    "apart from small regions near integer values of @xmath32 ( where the single pair josephson current is near suppression ) , the critical current can readily be obtained without any further calculation in most of the @xmath33-plane , and takes the form @xmath34",

    "the two loops are decoupled in this case and @xmath35 splits into two independent contributions corresponding to the simultaneous maximization of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "interestingly , quartet and pair cotunneling processes are responsible for an extra contribution to the critical current with a very specific flux dependence , leading to a macroscopic manifestation of nonlocal effects .",
    "in particular , this simple calculation points out that a measurement of the quartet current is possible by detecting the flux periodicity of the bisquid critical current .     combining the phases of each superconducting electrodes as well as the enclosed magnetic fluxes .",
    "the arrows near each junction set the conventions for the flowing currents and phase differences . ]",
    "this section is devoted to a microscopic calculation of the current through the bisquid .",
    "our goal is to justify the expression obtained from our simple phenomenological approach , to generalize it to more transparent junctions , and to show that the energy levels in the dots can be chosen such as to promote multi - pair transport , and in particular reveal the presence of a quartet resonance .",

    "each quantum dot @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is modeled by a single non - interacting level , with energy @xmath47 , described by the hamiltonian @xmath48 in both these expressions , we used pauli matrices acting in nambu space , and introduced nambu spinors for the lead and dot electrons , defined respectively as @xmath49 introducing a tunneling amplitude @xmath50 between lead @xmath15 and dot @xmath45 , and performing a gauge transformation to incorporate the superconducting phases @xmath51 in the tunneling term , one has for the tunneling part of the hamiltonian @xmath52 where , in absence of external magnetic field , we have @xmath53 , @xmath54 being the position of lead @xmath15 where tunneling to / from dot @xmath45 occurs .",

    "[ sec : setup ] , we expect quartets ( and more generally all multipair processes ) to lead to specific signatures in the critical current of the bisquid , identifiable through their periodicity in the magnetic flux . in what follows",

    "indeed , in practice , the magnetic flux through the device is provided by an external homogeneous magnetic field , which affects both @xmath99 and @xmath100 in a correlated way .",
    "the magnetic fluxes through loops @xmath7 and @xmath8 are therefore proportional to one another and only differ as a result of the different surface area enclosed by each loop , so that one can write @xmath102 where we introduced the average magnetic flux @xmath103 and an asymmetry parameter @xmath104 defined as @xmath105    in terms of these new variables , the expansion of the critical current @xmath106 takes the form @xmath107 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the most convenient way to probe for these harmonics is to introduce the fourier transform with respect to the average phase accumulated around the loops @xmath108 , which is defined as @xmath109 it follows that the fourier - transformed critical current @xmath110 is given by a set of peaks , located at @xmath111 , whose height is related to the amplitude of the @xmath112 harmonics . identifying which of these features are present in the spectrum provides a direct and clear indication of what processes are at play in the bisquid setup . since the critical current is real and even in @xmath103 , so is its fourier transform .",
    "the fourier spectrum is thus even in @xmath113 , and we focus only on positive @xmath113 .    as a first step ,",
    "we consider the simplifying approximation of identical junctions .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to discuss the typical signatures observed and dress up a physical picture , without obscuring it by dealing with too many parameters .",
    "we treat here the case of identical junctions , characterized by the same dot - lead tunneling rate @xmath114 . for simplicity , we assume that the energy levels @xmath47 of the dots can only take two values , either @xmath115 or @xmath116 , and distinguish various scenarios , based on the possible arrangements of these levels .",
    "we focus on the low - temperature regime ( @xmath85 ) and set the attenuation factor @xmath117 , compatible with current experimental realizations .",
    "we consider first the non - resonant case , for which the energy levels of the dots are non - zero , i.e. detuned with respect to the chemical potential in the superconducting leads .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - symmetric ] .",
    "in particular , we focused on two situations : ( a ) a symmetric arrangement of the energy levels of the dots involved in the two loops ( all chosen equal , @xmath118 ) and ( b ) an antisymmetric arrangement of the energy levels between the two loops ( where @xmath119 while @xmath120 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the obtained fourier profiles are strictly identical for the symmetric and antisymmetric cases , signaling that the @xmath121averaged critical current is insensitive to the arrangement of the dots energy levels , even beyond the low - transparency regime for which we could establish this property semi - analytically .",
    "the energy level symmetry has no influence on the fourier spectrum , which one might interpret as a consequence of some kind of induced particle - hole symmetry , due to the proximity effect from the neighboring superconducting electrodes the dots are in contact with .",
    "in particular this means that the quantum dots no longer play the role of an energy filter , as they typically do in hybrid normal metal - superconductor - normal metal structures , such as the cooper - pair beam splitter,@xcite where it allows to favor crossed andreev reflection over pair cotunneling processes .    in the low transparency regime ,",
    "the nonlocal effects are not strong enough to be readily identified and one expects the critical current to be insensitive to the arrangement of the energy levels . indeed , in both cases , the fourier profile is largely dominated by the usual josephson current associated to two independent loops .",
    "the fourier spectrum is composed of two sets of peaks , located at multiples of @xmath122 and @xmath123 respectively .",
    "these correspond to harmonics in @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( of order @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively ) and can be readily associated with the usual josephson current flowing through loops @xmath7 and @xmath8 in absence of any nonlocal coupling between the two .",
    "indeed , in the case of independent loops , one expects the critical current to be of the form @xmath126 .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a characteristic evolution of the fourier profile , which we could compare to the one obtained in the present low - transparency regime . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourierjosephson ] , we show that the weights associated with the different harmonics follow the predicted behavior , confirming that the critical current is dominated by the usual local harmonic josephson component .        as the transparency is increased , new structures appear in addition to the ones already observed in multiples of @xmath127 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : all - symmetric ] ) . observing components which involve the fluxes associated with each loop ( i.e. with both @xmath128 and @xmath129 nonzero ) signals the presence of nonlocal processes contributing to the critical current .",
    "they are relatively faint for low values of @xmath114 , but increase as one goes into the high transparency regime . for the highest value of the tunneling amplitude considered here ( @xmath130 ) these nonlocal contributions represent an appreciable total weight of about @xmath131 of the signal .    out of these new features , the most pronounced one ",
    "a peak in @xmath132  corresponds to a component of the @xmath121averaged critical current with a periodicity @xmath133 in the fluxes , i.e. periodic in @xmath134 .",
    "since it depends on both fluxes , this contribution can only arise from a process involving both the exchange of pairs between @xmath2 and @xmath1 as well as between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the periodicity in @xmath134 requires such an exchange to be correlated , and to occur in the same direction , that is from @xmath2 to @xmath135 or the other way around .",
    "this is precisely the microscopic definition of the so - called quartet process , an exchange of two correlated pairs from the central superconducting electrode @xmath2 to @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the quartet contribution increases rapidly with @xmath114 , and becomes substantial in the limit @xmath136 , representing close to @xmath137 of relative weight , much more than any other components ( apart from the leading harmonics in @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) . the physical nature of this structure",
    "is further confirmed by analyzing the sign of its amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all - symmetric ] , right ) , which turns out to be negative , as expected for the quartet contribution.type behavior of the quartet current , as the sign of the fourier amplitudes of the critical current is not directly related to the sign of the different contributions to the total current . ] in the non - resonant case , the bisquid thus seems a promising candidate to observe signatures of the quartet current , by monitoring the periodicity of the critical current in the total flux , i.e. as a function of the external magnetic field .",
    "note that other , much weaker signatures are also present with a periodicity in both fluxes . these could be attributed to either anharmonicities of the quartet current ( which would be expected for such high transparency ) or to higher order multipair contributions .",
    "it seems that the nonlocal effects are more pronounced when @xmath138 , which naturally takes us to the regime where this condition is most strongly fulfilled : the resonant case .",
    "we now turn to the resonant case , where all energy levels are chosen equal to the chemical potential in the superconducting leads ( set to 0 by convention ) .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - resonant ] .",
    "the low transparency regime is again largely dominated by the local harmonic josephson current , and absent of any nonlocal signatures . as a result , while the global prefactor @xmath139 might differ , the fourier spectrum of the critical current is identical to the one obtained in the non - resonant case .",
    "contributions associated with nonlocal processes appear rapidly , and already represent about @xmath140 of the signal for tunneling amplitudes as low as @xmath141 . as the transparency",
    "is further increased , the nonlocal components get stronger , totaling about half of the signal once one reaches @xmath142 .",
    "as in the non - resonant case , there is a proliferation of signatures corresponding to various periodicities in the fluxes @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( identified through the pair of integers @xmath112 ) . the strongest of these nonlocal components is again observed at @xmath143 and corresponds to the quartet current .",
    "this contribution grows much more rapidly as a function of @xmath114 , compared to the non - resonant case , and ends up being twice as large for a comparable value of the tunneling rate .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained in the previous section , as the regime @xmath138 proved to be the most suitable to observe signatures of multipair processes , it was to be expected that the resonant case would strengthen this trend further .",
    "along with the main harmonics @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and the quartet component @xmath146 , the fourier - transformed critical current also shows a substantial contribution for @xmath147 , corresponding to the periodicity @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) . like the quartet component",
    ", this contribution also increases with the transparency , and while it was only marginally present in the non - resonant case , it becomes significant at resonance .",
    "this feature can be attributed to the pair cotunneling process , which amounts to sending a cooper pair from @xmath1 to @xmath0 through the central superconducting electrode @xmath2 . as argued in ref .",
    ", the pair cotunneling process goes hand in hand with the quartet process , and it is not surprising that they appear side by side and behave in a somewhat similar way . as opposed to the low transparency expansion presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowgammaexp ] where it vanished for symmetry reasons , the pair cotunneling contribution is not negligible here , despite the apparent symmetry of the setup .",
    "this reveals the importance of high - order tunneling processes , not accounted for in the low-@xmath114 expansion , which involve the fluxes enclosed in the two loops , thus breaking the symmetry between the two branches of the setup .",
    "the presence of particularly strong quartet signatures makes this resonant case the best candidate to observe such nonlocal contributions to the critical current .",

    "the results of the previous section were obtained in the simpler case of identical junctions , and one might thus argue that they require some specific fine tuning in order to be observed . while the presence of external gates enables a rather precise control of the energy levels of the four quantum dots , the tunneling rates of the junctions depend on the sample design and can not be manipulated . in particular , making four identical highly transparent josephson junctions constitutes an experimental challenge .",
    "we therefore focus now on a more realistic situation , where we set the dots to be resonant with the superconducting electrodes , but do not make any assumptions concerning the tunneling parameters . to take this even further",

    "the results compiled in fig .  [ fig : histo - nonlocal ] suggest that the quartet and the pair cotunneling contributions bear some striking similarities when it comes to their weight distribution , further underlining the deep connection between the two processes . focusing on the quartet component",
    ", one readily sees that for a completely random selection of the tunneling amplitudes , the probability of observing a strong quartet signal is rather weak , as less than 60 out of the 1000 realizations show a relative weight beyond @xmath156 . however , the quartet signature is more often present than not , its relative weight reaching over @xmath157 for more than half the realizations . on average ,",
    "the contribution to the critical current associated with quartets culminates a little above @xmath158 . to put things into perspective ,",
    "in the resonant case considered in the previous section , a junction transparency of @xmath159 was sufficient to reach the same kind of values , stressing the importance of making the four junctions as identical as possible in practice .",
    "while on average the quartet signature is small , it is still detectable and could be further enhanced by filtering out the main josephson harmonics in @xmath99 and @xmath100 which are easily identifiable .",
    "one also has to keep in mind that the situation considered here is among the most unfavorable ones , and while practical realizations should be tailored to promote nonlocal multipair processes , even a random realization still has a solid chance of revealing their specific signatures .",
    "various physical phenomena can be responsible for a coupling between degrees of freedom from the two loops , leading to nonlocal effects whose signatures might mask a pure quartet signal .",
    "we hereby consider two of the most likely candidates susceptible to appear in our bisquid device .",
    "the setup under consideration is comprised of two loops where current can flow , so that one should take into account the geometrical inductance of such a circuit . while there could be both local and mutual inductances at play in the setup , the latter is the most likely to lead to strong nonlocal signatures as it couples the currents of pairs flowing through junctions @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "we could check that the presence of a self inductance only marginally modifies our results and thus decided , for simplicity , to focus on the effect of the mutual inductance alone .    due to the mutual geometrical inductance @xmath160 between loops @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the fluxes felt by the electrons circulating in the circuit",
    "is no longer set by the external magnetic field alone .",
    "instead , there exists an additional contribution on top of this external flux ( hereby labeled @xmath161 ) which depends on the current flowing in the nearby loop .",
    "following the conventions introduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] and eqs .",
    "- for the currents and fluxes , we write @xmath162 where the mutual inductance @xmath160 is positive .",
    "since some of the junction currents @xmath163 depend explicitly on the fluxes , it is obvious from eqs .  -",
    "that the total current through the device now has to be computed self - consistently . performing this self - consistent treatment in addition to the @xmath121averaging and on top of the maximization ( in order to extract the critical current )",
    "makes the numerical calculation a lot more demanding . in order to estimate the competing effects associated with the mutual inductance",
    ", we thus consider the simpler case of two disconnected loops ( i.e. without any microscopic nonlocal coupling ) and turn on the mutual inductance progressively , monitoring the fourier - transformed critical current .",
    "the results are provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : mutualinductance ] , where for illustrative purposes , we focused on the resonant highly transparent regime .",
    "whereas there are no noticeable modifications of the fourier spectrum for weak values of the mutual inductance , new signatures start appearing beyond @xmath164 ( where @xmath165 ) , a threshold which tends to increase as the tunneling rate @xmath114 is reduced ( not shown ) .",
    "these signatures grow rapidly with @xmath160 and are mainly located at @xmath147 and @xmath143 ( i.e. the @xmath154 and @xmath146 components respectively ) . unlike the general situation considered in the previous section , the most pronounced component involving both fluxes corresponds here to @xmath154 rather than @xmath146 , a characteristic specific to the presence of mutual inductance , which could be used in actual experiments to detect the presence of such effects .",
    "indeed , this can be explained by noticing that the mutual inductance tends to _ anticorrelate _ the currents in branches @xmath3 and @xmath5 in order to decrease the total current in the central electrode . on the contrary",
    ", the quartet mechanism tends to _ correlate _ the currents @xmath166 and @xmath167 reinforcing the current in the central electrode .",
    "the antagonistic effects of quartets and mutual inductance allows to discriminate both mechanisms . for the largest value of the mutual inductance considered here ,",
    "this structure at @xmath147 even becomes the leading component of the fourier signal , overcoming the contributions which depend on only one of the two fluxes . while a peak at @xmath143 is visible ( and as such , could be mistaken with signatures from the quartet process ) , it stays relatively weak ( @xmath168 at best ) and even decreases back for large values of @xmath160 .    in the end , although mutual inductance leads to structures in the critical current located at the same position in @xmath113 space , the behavior of these new features is specific enough to not be confused with quartet and pair cotunneling processes . still , the mutual inductance needs to be carefully estimated in experimental setupsev , the mutual inductance considered here is between 50 and 500 ph , which should be a reasonable order of magnitude of what is realized in actual setups . ] and taken into account when attempting to fit the data .     between loops ( expressed in units of @xmath165 ) , in the resonant ( @xmath169 ) highly transparent regime ( @xmath170 ) .",

    "[ fig : all - symmetric ] and [ fig : all - resonant ] , apart from the attenuation factor , @xmath171 . ]",
    "although absent from nanowire - based systems , direct tunneling between quantum dots is known to occur in carbon nanotubes .",
    "this generates a new contribution to the bare dot hamiltonian , of the form @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the direct tunneling amplitude between dots @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "this term opens a new channel for current to flow between the two loops , competing with the nonlocal exchange of pairs through @xmath2 .    to get a flavor of the effect of direct tunneling ,",
    "let us compute the critical current as a function of @xmath173 in the simpler case where the nonlocal coupling through the central superconducting electrode has been turned off . the new term that now appears in the total hamiltonian changes the form of the matsubara green s function for the dot electrons by affecting its anomalous part @xmath174 , which becomes @xmath175 the critical current is then obtained from eqs .   and as before .",
    "the fourier - transformed critical current as a function of the direct tunneling @xmath173 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : directtunneling ] for the resonant highly transparent case .",
    "as it turns out , direct tunneling can lead to signatures that are very similar to nonlocal multipair processes . in the resonant case considered here , even for rather small values of @xmath173 ( say , @xmath176 ) new peaks appear in the fourier spectrum corresponding precisely to the contributions of interest , namely @xmath146 and @xmath154 ( associated earlier to quartet and pair cotunneling processes ) .",
    "moreover , these features grow rapidly as @xmath173 is increased , and for a typical value of only @xmath177 , the resulting fourier - transformed critical current looks almost identical to the one obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig : all - resonant ] in presence of nonlocal crossed andreev reflection ( same set of harmonics with similar weights , only the ones in the vicinity of @xmath178 differ ) . indeed , from inspecting the anomalous green s functions in presence of a coupling through @xmath2 , eq .  ,",
    "and in presence of direct tunneling , eq .  , one readily sees that @xmath173 roughly assumes the same role as the prefactor @xmath179 ( up to complications related to @xmath121averaging ) .",
    "indeed , direct interdot tunneling offers an alternative channel for the production of correlated pairs , as shown in refs .  .",
    "yet , it is interesting to discriminate this mechanism from the quartet one , for instance by synchronous detection while slowly varying one key parameter of the setup .",
    ", in the resonant ( @xmath169 ) highly transparent regime ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "all other parameters have been chosen identical to figs .",
    "[ fig : all - symmetric ] and [ fig : all - resonant ] , apart from the attenuation factor , @xmath171 . ]",
    "to summarize , our main results are as follows :    \\(a ) the phenomenological model is sufficient to capture the main ingredients of the physics involved in this system in the low transparency regime ;    \\(b ) studying the flux - dependence of the critical current through a full microscopic calculation leads , for identical junctions in the non - resonant regime , to new signatures .",
    "these could be attributed to nonlocal multipair processes ;    \\(c ) in the case of resonant dots , and for highly transparent junctions , these quartet signatures become particularly strong ( of the same order as the josephson contribution ) making this regime the most promising to investigate multipair production ;    \\(d ) our results are robust against strong variations of tunneling amplitude throughout the setup . even in the worst case scenario of 8 very different tunneling parameters ,",
    "there is a strong probability of observing a quartet signal ;    \\(e ) the most likely competing effects either lead to qualitatively different signatures or open a new channel that contributes to the formation of correlated pairs , in addition to the standrad crossed andreev reflection .",
    "this work thus provides an alternative experimental setup for the observation of nonlocal multipair processes .",
    "unlike previous work on a voltage - biased all - superconducting bijunction@xcite , the current study focuses on an equilibrium situation , in the coherent dissipationless regime . making use of interferometry ,",
    "this allows for the observation of specific features associated with quartet processes that do not require to study intricate phase and voltage dependences , and hopefully provides an unequivocal experimental signature of these phenomena .    in conclusion",
    ", we proposed a setup consisting of four josephson junctions , defining two twinned loops in a nanotube ( or nanowire ) based system connected to three superconducting electrodes , which we dubbed a bisquid .",
    "we presented a phenomenological argument to motivate our analysis then derived a microscopic theory allowing a careful description of the setup in the full parameter space .",
    "we showed that by measuring the critical current as a function of the average flux through the loops ( i.e. the external magnetic field ) , the device could reveal signatures associated with nonlocal multipair contributions , in particular the so - called quartet process , thus making them experimentally observable in an equilibrium situation .",
    "we also suggested that potential experimental realizations pay specific attention to some competing effects which might interfere with these very signatures .",
    "a natural extension of the present work consists in taking into account local coulomb interaction on the dots .",
    "this constitutes a real challenge , which could be tackled through various approximate treatments , such as perturbative diagrammatic resummation or self - consistent mean - field approaches.@xcite interactions are expected to be particularly relevant when dealing with closed dots , with weak tunneling amplitudes to the leads .",
    "we showed , however , that the most interesting regime to observe quartet signatures in the bisquid setup corresponds to the opposite case of large values of the tunneling rate @xmath114 , for which coulomb interactions play a more limited role .",
    "as long as one stays away from the deep kondo regime ( for which the occupation of the dots is close to 1 at all times ) , we therefore do not expect any dramatic qualitative change of our results due to coulomb interactions .",
