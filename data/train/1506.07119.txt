    "the question of whether a mass term for the graviton field can be introduced existed in einstein s theory of general relativity since its inception .",
    "massive gravity came into existence as a straightforward modification of general relativity by providing consistent interaction terms which are interpreted as a graviton mass .",
    "such a theory can describe our universe , which is currently undergoing accelerating expansion without introducing a bare cosmological constant .",
    "massive gravity modifies gravity by weakening it at the large scale compared with general relativity , which allows the universe to accelerate , while its predictions at small scales are the same as those in general relativity .",
    "furthermore , if solution exists in this theory , it may also elucidate the dark energy problem .",
    "hence , in recent years there were numerous developments in the massive gravity theories @xcite .",
    "the first attempt was done , in 1939 , by fierz and pauli @xcite .",
    "they added the interaction terms at the linearized level of general relativity but later it was found that their theory suffered from discontinuity in predictions which was pointed out by van dam , veltman , and zakharov , the so - called van dam - veltman - zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite .",
    "this discontinuity problem invoked further studies on the nonlinear generalization of fierz - pauli massive gravity . during the search for such generalizations",
    ", vainshtein found the origin of the vdvz discontinuity is that the prediction made by the linearized theory can not be trusted inside some characteristic `` vainshtein '' radius and he also proposed the mechanism for the nonlinear massive gravity which can be used to recover the predictions made by general relativity @xcite . at the same time , boulware and deser found that such nonlinear generalizations usually generate an equation of motion which has a higher derivative term yielding a ghost instability in the theory , later called boulware - deser ( bd ) ghost @xcite .",
    "however , these problems , arising in the construction of the massive gravity have been resolved in the last decade by first introducing stckelberg fields @xcite .",
    "this permits a class of potential energies depending on the gravitational metric and an internal minkowski metric .",
    "furthermore , to avoid reappearance of the ghost in massive gravity , the set of allowed mass terms was confined and furnished perturbatively by de rham , gabadadze and tolley ( drgt ) @xcite .",
    "they summed these terms and found three possibilities , viz .",
    "quadratic , cubic and quartic combinations of the mass terms .",
    "the drgt massive gravity is constructed suitably so that the equations of motion have no higher derivative term , so that the ghost field is absent .",
    "however , these nonlinear terms lead to complexity in the calculations and hence , in general , finding exact solutions in this theory is strenuous .",
    "nevertheless , recently , several interesting measures have been taken to obtain the spherically symmetric black holes in various massive gravities @xcite .",
    "in particular , a spherically symmetric black hole solution with a ricci flat horizon in four dimensional massive gravity with a negative cosmological constant was obtained by vegh @xcite , and was generalized to study the corresponding thermodynamical properties and phase transition structure @xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric solutions for drgt were also addressed in @xcite , the corresponding charged black hole solution was found in @xcite and its bi - gravity extension , was found in @xcite , which includes as particular cases as the previously known spherically symmetric black hole solutions .",
    "( see @xcite , for reviews on black holes in massive gravity , see also @xcite for the black hole solution in other classes of massive gravity ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present a new class of exact spherically symmetric black hole solutions including generalization to the charged case in drgt massive gravity , and also to discuss their thermodynamical properties .",
    "it turns out that the solution discussed in this paper represents a generalization of the schwarzschild solution that includes most of the known drgt black hole solutions .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    ", we review drgt massive gravity .",
    "we present the modified equations of motion for drgt massive gravity and a class of exact black hole solutions in section iii .",
    "the calculation of the thermodynamical quantities associated with the drgt black hole solution and the study of the phase structure of a black hole in the canonical ensemble approach are the main subject of section iv .",
    "the analyses in section iv are extended for the charged case in the section v , and finally we summarize our results and evoke some perspectives to end the paper in section vi .",
    "we have used units which fix the speed of light and the gravitational constant via @xmath2 .",
    "we begin by reviewing drgt massive gravity , which is a well known nonlinear generalization of a massive gravity and is free of the bd ghost by incorporating higher order interaction terms into the lagrangian .",
    "the drgt massive gravity can be represented as einstein gravity interacting with a scalar field , and hence its action is the well - known einstein - hilbert action plus suitable nonlinear interaction terms as given by @xcite @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the ricci scalar and @xmath5 is a potential for the graviton which modifies the gravitational sector with the parameter @xmath6 interpreted as graviton mass .",

    "therefore , it is worthwhile to find , for this choice of the physical and the fiducial metric , whether the number of degree of freedom still valids and each of them is healthy .",

    "<S> we present an exact spherical black hole solution in de rham , gabadadze and tolley ( drgt ) massive gravity for a generic choice of the parameters in the theory , and also discuss the thermodynamical and phase structure of the black hole in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles ( for the charged case ) . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the drgt black hole solution includes other known solutions to the einstein field equations , such as the monopole - de sitter - schwarzschild solution with the coefficients of the third and fourth terms in the potential and the graviton mass in massive gravity naturally generates the cosmological constant and the global monopole term . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we compute the mass , temperature and entropy of the drgt black hole , and also perform thermodynamical stability analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the presence of the graviton mass completely changes the black hole thermodynamics , and it can provide the hawking - page phase transition which also occurs for the charged black holes . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the entropy of a black hole is barely affected and still obeys the standard area law . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our results , in the limit @xmath0 , reduced exactly to _ </S>",
