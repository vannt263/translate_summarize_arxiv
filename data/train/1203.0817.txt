    "let @xmath0 denote a sequence of independent , identically distributed ( iid ) light tailed ( their moment generating function is finite in a neighborhood of zero ) non - lattice ( modulus of their characteristic function is strictly less than one ) random vectors taking values in @xmath1 , for @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we consider the problem of efficient simulation estimation of the probability density function of @xmath3 at points away from @xmath4 , and the tail probability @xmath5 for sets @xmath6 that do not contain @xmath4 and essentially are affine transformations of the non - negative orthant of @xmath1 .",
    "we develop an efficient simulation estimation methodology for these rare quantities that exploits the well known saddle point representations for the probability density function of @xmath7 obtained from fourier inversion of the characteristic function of @xmath8 ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , using parseval s relation , similar representations for @xmath9 are easily developed . to illustrate the broader applicability of the proposed methodology",
    ", we also develop similar representation for @xmath10 in a single dimension setting @xmath11 , for @xmath12 , and using it develop an efficient simulation methodology for this quantity as well .",
    "the problem of efficient simulation estimation of the tail probability density function has not been studied in the literature , although , from practical viewpoint its clear that visual inspection of shape of such density functions provides a great deal of insight into the tail behavior of the sums of random variables .",
    "another potential application maybe in the maximum likelihood framework for parameter estimation where closed form expressions for density functions of observed outputs are not available , but simulation based estimators provide an accurate proxy .",
    "the problem of efficiently estimating @xmath9 via importance sampling , besides being of independent importance , may also be considered a building block for more complex problems involving many streams of i.i.d .",
    "random variables ( see e.g. , @xcite , for a queuing application ; @xcite for applications in credit risk modeling ) . this problem has been extensively studied in rare event simulation literature ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "essentially , the literature exploits the fact that the zero variance importance sampling estimator for @xmath9 , though unimplementable , has a markovian representation .",
    "this representation may be exploited to come up with provably efficient , implementable approximations ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "sadowsky and bucklew in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) developed exponential twisting based importance sampling algorithms to arrive at unbiased estimators for @xmath9 that they proved were asymptotically or weakly efficient ( as per the current standard terminology in rare event simulation literature , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for an introduction to rare event simulation .",
    "popular efficiency criteria for rare event estimators are also discussed later in section [ popular : measure ] ) .",
    "the importance sampling algorithms proposed by @xcite were state independent in that each @xmath13 was generated from a distribution independent of the previously generated @xmath14 .",
    "blanchet , leder and glynn in @xcite also considered the problem of estimating @xmath9 where they introduced state dependent , exponential twisting based importance sampling distributions ( the distribution of generated @xmath13 depended on the previously generated @xmath14 ) .",
    "they showed that , when done correctly , such an algorithm is strongly efficient , or equivalently has the bounded relative error property .",
    "the problem of efficient estimation of the expected overshoot @xmath15 $ ] is of considerable importance in finance and insurance settings . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first paper that directly tackles this estimation problem .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in this article we exploit the saddle point based representations of the rare event quantities considered .",
    "these representations allow us to write the quantity of interest @xmath16 as a product @xmath17 where @xmath18 ( that is , @xmath19 as @xmath20 ) and is known in closed form .",
    "so the problem of interest is estimation of @xmath21 , which is an integral of a known function .",
    "note that @xmath22 as @xmath20 . in the literature ,",
    "asymptotic expansions for @xmath21 exist , however they require computation of third and higher order derivatives of the log - moment generating function of @xmath23 .",
    "this is particularly difficult in higher dimensions .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to control the bias in such approximations . as we note later in numerical experiments , these biases can be significant even when probabilities are as small as of order @xmath24 . in the insurance and financial industry , simulation , with its associated variance reduction techniques ,",
    "is the preferred method for tail risk measurement even when asymptotic approximations are available ( since these approximations are typically poor in the range of practical interest ; see e.g. , @xcite ) .    in our analysis",
    ", we note that the integral @xmath21 can be expressed as an expectation of a random variable using importance sampling .",
    "furthermore , the zero variance estimator for this expectation is easily ascertained .",
    "we approximate this estimator by an implementable importance sampling distribution and prove that the resulting unbiased estimator of @xmath16 has the desirable asymptotically vanishing relative error property .",
    "more tangibly , the estimator of the integral @xmath21 has the property that its variance converges to zero as @xmath20 .",
    "an additional advantage of the proposed approach over existing methodologies for estimating @xmath9 and related rare quantities is that while these methods require @xmath25 computational effort to generate each sample output , our approach per sample requires small and fixed effort independent of @xmath26 .",
    "the use of saddle point methods to compute tail probabilities has a long and rich history ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "to the best of our knowledge the proposed methodology is the first attempt to combine the expanding literature on rare event simulation with the classical theory of saddle point approximations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the popular performance evaluation measures used in rare event simulation , and the existing literature on estimating @xmath27 .",
    "then , in section 3 , we develop an importance sampling estimator for the density of @xmath7 and show that it has asymptotically vanishing relative error . in section 4 , we devise an integral representation for @xmath9 and develop an importance sampling estimator for it and again prove that it has asymptotically vanishing relative error . in this section",
    "we also discuss how this methodology can be adapted to similarly efficiently estimate @xmath28 in a single dimension setting . in section 5",
    "we report the results of a few numerical experiments to support our analysis .",
    "we end with a brief conclusion and a discussion on some directions for future research in section 6 .",

    "note that the relative width of the confidence interval obtained using the central limit theorem approximation is proportional to the ratio of the standard deviation of the estimator divided by its mean .",

    "as shown in table  [ table : taboet ] , this difference can be far more significant in multi - dimension settings , thus emphasizing the need for simulation despite the existence of asymptotics for the rare quantities considered .",
    "in this paper we considered the rare event problem of efficient estimation of the density function of the average of iid light tailed random vectors evaluated away from their mean , and the tail probability that this average takes a large deviation . in a single dimension setting we also considered the estimation problem of expected overshoot associated with a sum of iid random variables taking a large deviations .",
    "we used the well known saddle point representations for these performance measures and applied importance sampling to develop provably efficient unbiased estimation algorithms that significantly improve upon the performance of the existing algorithms in literature and are simple to implement .    in this paper",
