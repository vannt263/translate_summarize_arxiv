    "chern  simons ( cs ) theories are certainly some of the most interesting field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions . among the interesting phenomena one sees in these theories",
    "are : the quantum hall effect , landau levels , non - trivial topological structures , vortices , and anyons . for a review of these phenomena",
    "see @xcite .",
    "some of these ( 2 + 1)-dimensional phenomena have been observed experimentally in condensed matter systems .",
    "cs theories are also often described as topological theories @xcite since for most gauge groups the cs coupling must obey a quantization condition for the theory to remain gauge invariant . within this rich literature on cs theories",
    "there is also considerable work on sym  cs theories .",
    "these theories have their own remarkable properties .",
    "it has been shown that there is a finite anomaly that shifts the cs coupling @xcite , and it has been conjectured by witten @xcite that this theory spontaneously breaks supersymmetry for some values of the cs coupling",
    ". there are other related reasons for interest in cs theories .",
    "witten @xcite has conjectured that string field theory is essentially a non - commutative cs theory .",
    "recently this led to a conjecture by susskind @xcite that relates string theory to the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "since these theories are interesting from so many different points of view , it is certainly useful to numerically simulate them .",
    "the method we will use is sdlcq ( supersymmetric discrete light - cone quantization ) .",
    "this is a numerical method that can be used to solve any theory with enough supersymmetry to be finite .",
    "the central point of this method is that using dlcq we can construct a finite dimensional representation of the superalgebra @xcite . from this representation of the superalgebra",
    ", we construct a finite - dimensional hamiltonian which we diagonalize numerically .",
    "we repeat the process for larger and larger representations and extrapolate the solution to the continuum .",
    "we have already solved standard ( 2 + 1)-dimensional supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theories by this method @xcite , so it is clear that sym - cs theories are within our reach .    in this paper we will start with sym  cs theory in 2 + 1 dimensions and dimensionally",
    "reduce it to two dimensions by requiring all of the fields to be independent of the transverse coordinate .",
    "this is an interesting ( 1 + 1)-dimensional supersymmetric theory in its own right .",
    "it is a good starting point for our numerical simulations because we can solve this problem using two completely independent codes , one a mathematica code and the other a c++ code .",
    "when we move on to 2 + 1 dimensions in future work , the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional results will be related to the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional results in a nontrivial way .",
    "we found this to be the case in our previous work on ( 2 + 1)-dimensional sym theories , and it will most probably be the case here as well .",
    "this will provide us an important check on our code for solving the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional problem .",
    "it is important to develop this chain of numerical checks , since there are no analytical or other numerical solutions to check our results against .",
    "many of the most interesting aspects of cs theory will be lost by this reduction , most notably the quantization of the cs coupling .",
    "however , one particularly interesting property that will be preserved is the fact that the cs term simulates a mass for the theory .",
    "it is well known that supersymmetric abelian cs theory is simply the theory of a free massive fermion and a free massive boson . in the non - abelian theory",
    "additional interactions are introduced , but we expect to also see this mass effect .",
    "this is particularly interesting here because dimensionally reduced @xmath0 sym is a very stringy theory .",
    "the low - mass states are dominated by fock states with many constituents , and as the size of the superalgebraic representation is increased , states with lower masses and more constituents appear .",
    "the connection between string theory and supersymmetric gauge theory leads one to expect this type of behavior ; however , these gauge theories are not very qcd - like .",
    "ultimately one might like to make a connection with the low - mass spectrum observed in nature .",
    "we expect to find states in sym ",
    "cs theory that are much more qcd - like , because of the effective mass for the constituents introduced by the cs term .",
    "we will see that some of the low - mass states will be dominated by valence - like fock states that have only a few constituents . as we go to larger and larger representation of the superalgebra",
    ", we will resolve these states better and better , and any new states that appear will be heavier .",
    "we will also find highly mixed states without a valence structure .",
    "finally , we find that at strong coupling the low - energy spectrum is dominated by states that are a reflection of the bps states of the sym theory in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite and are therefore independent of the coupling @xmath1 .",
    "> from the wave functions of the bound states we will be able to find the structure functions of both the valence and sea partons . some of the highly mixed states will have a double - humped structure function .",
    "some of these structure functions are similar to those conjectured in various phenomenological calculations ; they are the result of the solution of a nontrivial gauge theory .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : supercs ] we give a general discussion of supersymmetric light - cone - quantized sym ",
    "cs theory in light - cone gauge .",
    "we then give the dimensionally reduced discrete formulation of the supercharges and discuss the other symmetries of the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we discuss our numerical method and some of the new wrinkles that appear in cs theory .",
    "we also present and discuss in this section the spectrum of bound states as well as a variety of properties of these states including their structure functions .",
    "we will see that it is a very qcd - like theory as opposed to pure sym theory , which is very stringy . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize the results and discuss the prospects and challenges for calculating in the full ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theory .",
    "we will consider @xmath0 supersymmetric cs theory in 2 + 1 dimensions as the starting point of our discussion . while we will reduce this theory to a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theory for numerical simulation here",
    ", we eventually plan to simulate the full theory , and it is therefore useful to present a detailed light - cone formulation in light - cone gauge .",
    "the lagrangian of this theory is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the cs coupling and @xmath4 the two components of the spinor @xmath5 are in the adjoint representation of @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "we will work in the large-@xmath8 limit .",

    "the equations of motion for the gauge fields are @xmath24 where @xmath25 for @xmath26 this is a constraint for @xmath27 , @xmath28 in light - cone gauge , @xmath29 , this reduces to @xmath30\\,.\\ ] ] the equation of motion for the fermion is @xmath31 expressing everything in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath33 leads to the equations of motion @xmath34 the second of which is a constraint equation .",
    "the constraint equations are used to eliminate @xmath33 and @xmath27 .",
    "we now reduce the theory dimensionally to two dimensions by setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 for all fields .",
    "this yields , from eq .",
    "( [ supercharges ] ) and the constraints , @xmath37           + 2\\psi\\psi-\\frac{\\kappa}{g }                    \\partial_-\\phi\\right)\\frac{1}{\\partial_-}\\psi\\,.\\ ] ] the mode expansions in two dimensions are @xmath38\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ % \\psi_{ij}(0,x^- ) & = & \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^\\infty           dk^+\\left[b_{ij}(k^+)e^{-{\\rm i}k^+x^-}+           b^\\dagger_{ji}(k^+)e^{{\\rm i}k^+x^-}\\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to discretize the theory we impose periodic boundary conditions on the boson and fermion fields alike , and obtain an expansion of the fields with discrete momentum modes .",
    "thus the discrete version of the cs part of the supercharge is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a rescaled cs coupling and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are rescaled discrete field operators @xmath43 the ordinary supersymmetric part of the supercharge is listed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the supercharge for @xmath0 sym in 2 + 1 dimensions has a contribution of the form @xmath44 of course , the light - cone energy is @xmath45 , so @xmath46 behaves like a mass , and here we see that @xmath47 appears in a very similar way to @xmath46 and therefore behaves in many ways like a mass .",
    "when comparing the two contributions to the supercharge , we see that we have a relative @xmath48 between them .",
    "thus the usual eigenvalue problem @xmath49 has to be solved by using fully complex methods .",
    "we retain the @xmath50-symmetry , which is associated with the orientation of the large-@xmath8 string of partons in a state @xcite . in a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model",
    "this orientation parity is usually referred as a @xmath51 symmetry , and we will follow that here .",
    "it gives a sign when the color indices are permuted @xmath52 we will use this symmetry to reduce the hamiltonian matrix size and hence the numerical effort .",
    "all of our states will be labeled by the @xmath51 sector in which they appear .",
    "we will not attempt to label the states by their normal parity ; in the light - cone this is only an approximate symmetry .",
    "such a labeling could be done in an approximate way , as was shown by hornbostel @xcite , and might be useful for comparison purposes if at some point there are results from lattice simulations of the present theory .",
    "we convert the mass eigenvalue problem @xmath53 to a matrix eigenvalue problem by introducing a basis where @xmath54 is diagonal . in sdlcq",
    "this is done by first discretizing the supercharge @xmath55 and then constructing @xmath56 from the square of the supercharge : @xmath57 . to discretize the supercharge",
    ", we introduce discrete longitudinal momenta @xmath58 as fractions @xmath59 of the total longitudinal momentum @xmath54 , where @xmath60 is an integer that determines the resolution of the discretization and is known in dlcq as the harmonic resolution  @xcite . because light - cone longitudinal momenta are always positive , @xmath60 and each @xmath61 are positive integers ; the number of constituents is then bounded by @xmath60 .",
    "the integrals in @xmath55 are approximated by a trapezoidal form .",
    "the continuum limit is then recovered by taking the limit @xmath62 .    in constructing the discrete approximation we drop the longitudinal zero - momentum mode .",
    "for some discussion of dynamical and constrained zero modes , see the review  @xcite and previous work  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of these modes would be ideal , but the techniques required to include them in a numerical calculation have proved to be difficult to develop , particularly because of nonlinearities . for dlcq calculations that can be compared with exact solutions , the exclusion of zero modes does not affect the massive spectrum  @xcite . in scalar theories",
    "it has been known for some time that constrained zero modes can give rise to dynamical symmetry breaking  @xcite , and work continues on the role of zero modes and near zero modes in these theories  @xcite .    to obtain the spectrum of the cs theory",
    "we solve the complex eigenvalue problem , eq .",
    "( [ evp ] ) . for the numerical evaluation",
    "we can exploit the structure of the supercharge @xmath63 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are real matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian has thus an easy decomposition into a real and imaginary part in the bosonic sector @xmath64 and the fermionic sector @xmath65 our earliest sdlcq calculations were done using a code written in mathematica and performed on a pc .",
    "this code was then rewritten in c++ and substantially revised .",
    "it runs on a linux workstation with 2 gb of ram and can handle as many as 2,000,000 fock states .",
    "the present calculation was done in both codes as a check .",
    "we limit the calculation to resolution @xmath66 because it seems sufficient here and because the present c++ code , which was primarily written for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models , would require some non - trivial modifications to run at higher longitudinal resolutions .",
    "the low - energy spectrum , with @xmath67 , is fit to @xmath68 .",
    "these fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for some of the low - energy states . in principle",
    ", higher energy states can also be found , but at these couplings the states just above these are difficult to disentangle because of level crossings . in the @xmath51 even sector",
    "we find the continuum masses to be ( in units of @xmath69 ) @xmath70 , 18.33 , 27.46 , and 43.20 , whereas in the @xmath51 odd sector we have @xmath71 , 29.13 , 32.83 , 39.52 , and 47.40 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented an analysis of dimensionally reduced supersymmetric ym theory with a cs term using the numerical method sdlcq , which exactly preserves the supersymmetry of this theory .",
    "we constructed finite dimensional representations of the superalgebra and from them a finite dimensional hamiltonian which we solved numerically .",
    "as we go to higher dimensional representations , the solutions converge rapidly .",
    "> from these solutions we extracted the properties of the bound states of this theory .",
    "we found that the bound states are very different from the bound states of @xmath0 sym in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the bound states of sym are characterized by their stringy nature , that is a set of states where the states with the most partons have the lowest energy .",
    "the cs theory is generally very qcd - like .",
    "the states with more partons tend to be more massive , and many of the low - mass states have a valence - like structure .",
    "these states have a dominant component of the wave function with a particular number and type of parton .",
    "we have found the spectrum of these states and studied it as a function of the cs coupling .",
    "we found that , as expected , the cs coupling behaves as an effective mass .",
    "as it increases we see that the masses of the bound states generally increase , and the average number of partons of the low - mass bound states tends to decrease .",
    "also , the sym theory has an interesting set of massless bps states .",
    "these states are reflected in the cs theory as a set of states whose masses are approximately independent of @xmath1 and equal to the square of the sum of the cs masses of the partons in the bound state .",
    "since these bps states are also present in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional sym theory , we expect to see their reflection in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional cs theory .",
    "we have investigated the structure functions for these bound states and found that they behave in very interesting ways .",
    "the distribution for the states with a valence structure are peaked near the inverse of the number of valence partons , and the sea distribution appears to peak at small @xmath72 in most if not all cases .",
    "we also see strongly mixed states with interesting double - humped structure functions .",
    "there have been interesting conjectures about structure functions of this type in qcd @xcite , and it is interesting that we actually find such a structure function in the solution of an actual gauge theory .    in summary ,",
    "the sdlcq solutions of dimensionally reduced supersymmetric cs theory are very interesting , maybe more interesting , at least with respect to their qcd - like structure , than are the solutions for pure supersymmetric sym theory .",
    "clearly this provides a strong base and encouragement to move on to 2 + 1 dimensions .",
