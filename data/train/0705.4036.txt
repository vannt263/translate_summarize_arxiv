    "it is known from 70-th of the last century that contraction phase of a closed universe filled with a massive scalar field can be followed by expansion for some particular initial condition set @xcite . on the other hand , every expansion stage of such universe",
    "is ultimately followed by a contraction one .",
    "these two features of dynamics ( which are specific for a closed universe in contrast to open or flat worlds ) result in a rather complicated behavior which in some situations can be chaotic .",
    "a chaotic dynamics in massive scalar field cosmology was first found by d. page in @xcite , and have been studied in detail in @xcite with the corresponding discussion on the meaning of chaos in general relativity .",
    "the chaotic dynamics in question represents an example of a transient chaos with a structure of `` chaotic repellor ''  a countable set of unstable periodic and uncountable set of unstable aperiodic trajectories escaping cosmological singularity .",
    "both sets have zero measure in initial condition space .",
    "an useful toy model of such kind of dynamics ( elastic scattering on three discs on a plane ) have been described in @xcite .",
    "all these early results have been found for a massive scalar field ",
    "scalar field with the potential in the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the scalar field mass .",
    "studies of other forms of the potential reveal several different form of dynamics with transitions from one form to another ( for a short review see @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of motion can be derived from the general relativity action with a scalar field @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the constant parameter called the planck mass , @xmath4 is the scalar curvature of a space - time . for a closed friedman model with the metric @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a cosmological scale factor , @xmath7 is the metric of a unit 3-sphere and with homogeneous scalar field @xmath8 the action ( 1 ) gives the following equations :    @xmath9    @xmath10    with two variables - a scale factor @xmath11 and a scalar field @xmath8 .",
    "this system has one first integral of motion @xmath12    this integral plays the role of energy and is equal to zero for cosmological solutions of the system ( 3)-(4 ) .    if @xmath13 , the system is integrable ( in this case a scalar field has the equation of state of stiff matter ) , though the dynamics is finite in time ",
    "the universe evolves from big bang singularity towards a big crunch singularity through a point of maximal expansion .",
    "there is also another reason why we can not develop a perturbation analysis for the system ( 3)(5 ) : it can be easily checked that multiplying the scalar field potential @xmath14 by a constant with simultaneous rescaling of the scale factor @xmath11 and time @xmath15 does not change the system .",
    "this means that there is no continuous limit when , for example , @xmath16 for the massive scalar field .",
    "an important property of the constraint equation ( 5 ) is that @xmath17 and @xmath18 enter in its left - hand side with opposite signs . rewriting ( 5 ) in the form",
    "@xmath19 it is easy to see that    * there are no forbidden regions in the configuration state . *",
    "the configuration state is divided to two regions  the region where the right - hand side of ( 6 ) is positive ( and possible extrema of the scale factor are located ) , and the region where it is negative ( where possible extrema of the scalar field are located ) .",
    "the boundary between these two regions is the curve @xmath20    extrema of the scale factor can exist only in the region where @xmath21 using ( 3 ) it can be shown that the possible points of maximal expansion ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) are localized inside the region @xmath24 while the possible points of transition from contraction to expansion ( often called bounce ) lie outside this region being at the same time inside the region of scalar field extrema .",
    "zero - velocity points ( @xmath25 ) of a trajectory , it they exist , should lie on the curve ( 7 ) .",
    "numerical studies show that trajectories with these points play an important role in the described chaotic structure . in particular , all primary ( i.e. having one bounce per period ) periodical trajectories have zero - velocity points as the points of bounce ( see numerical examples in @xcite ) .",
    "numerical integrations show also that there are regions on the curve ( 7 ) which can not contain points of bounce .",
    "if a trajectory , starting from the curve ( 7 ) is directed inside the zone of possible extrema of the scale factor , it rapidly goes through a point of maximal expansion and evolves further towards a singularity .",
    "the condition for a trajectory to be directed into the opposite zone ( the zone of possible extrema of the scalar field ) can be written as @xmath26 where the function @xmath27 in the rhs is the equation of the curve ( 7 ) .",
    "the case of equality in ( 8) corresponds to a trajectory , tangent to the curve ( 7 ) .",
    "this situation was first described in @xcite , and we call such point as a page point . for the system ( 1)-(3 )",
    "the equation for the page point is @xcite @xmath28    for power - law scalar field potentials the condition ( 8) is satisfied if @xmath29 , and the corresponding part of the curve ( 7 ) contains zero - velocity bounce points of periodical trajectories . for exponential potentials",
    "the condition ( 8) can be violated for all points on the curve ( 7 ) , and the whole chaotic structure disappears @xcite .",
    "the dynamics in this case can be called regular in the sense that the structure of chaotic repellor is absent , and there are no trajectories escaping a cosmological singularity",
    ". global structure of trajectories is the same as for @xmath30 case  any trajectory starts and ends in a singularity .",
    "this does not mean that there are no local instabilities of trajectories ( see the next section ) , however , as the dynamics is finite in time these instabilities are not important for the global picture .",
    "in the next section we study local instabilities of trajectories , in sec.3 we describe a new regular regime for the system ( 3)(5 ) , which appears when the scalar field potential is sufficiently shallow .",
    "the system ( 3)-(4 ) can be considered as a hamiltonian system with @xmath31 where the canonical variables are @xmath32    we rewrite ( 10 ) in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35    according to maupertuis principle we can introduce an auxiliary metric space with geodesics coinciding with trajectories of initial system .",
    "this method of geodesics have been used actively since the middle of the last century @xcite in various physical problems from yang - mills fields @xcite to cosmology @xcite . calculating the riemann curvature @xmath36 of this space we get the criterion of local instability in the form @xmath37 . for the system with a hamiltonian in the form ( 11 ) ,",
    "the resulting curvature is @xcite    @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "taking @xmath40 we get the curvature for cosmological solutions of our system :    @xmath41,\\ ] ]    where @xmath42 denotes partial differentiating with respect to a scalar field @xmath8 .",
    "the curvature diverges at the curve ( 7 ) , and this is a consequence of the fact that the supermetrics @xmath43 is not positively definite .",
    "this property is typical for dynamical systems of general relativity and discussed in @xcite .",
    "three different cases are plotted in fig.1 .",
    "the first plot ( fig.1(a ) ) represents the situation of a massive scalar field with the potential @xmath44 .",
    "we know that a chaotic repellor exists in the corresponding dynamical system .",
    "the fig.1(b ) is created for the potential @xmath45 , for which it is known that the structure of chaotic repellor is absent .",
    "we can see that in both cases there are zones with @xmath46 as well as zones with @xmath47 .",
    "it means that studying only local properties of our system , it is impossible to understand its global features .",
    "the chaotic system does not belong to the class of anosov s u - systems ( this would require @xmath47 in all points of the configuration space ) , which posses maximally strong statistical properties @xcite .",
    "( b ) and @xmath48 with @xmath49 ( c ) .",

    "possible bounces can be located between bold and dashed lines.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( b ) and @xmath48 with @xmath49 ( c ) .",
    "possible bounces can be located between bold and dashed lines.,title=\"fig : \" ]    however , some qualitative difference in configuration of @xmath50 and @xmath51 zones exists between the chaotic case in fig.1(a ) and the regular case in fig .",
    "it can be easily checked that the curve @xmath52 intersects the boundary curve ( 7 ) at the page point ( 9 ) , so the picture for the system with page points ( as for power - law potentials ) and without page points ( for steep potentials ) should be different .",
    "moreover , we can see from the plots that the area of possible bounces ( which is located between two hiperbolae ) belongs to a stable zone in a regular case , and some part of this area is located in unstable zone for the chaotic case .",
    "this can be checked further for the potential @xmath48 with @xmath49 , where chaotic repellor exists for intermediate values of @xmath8 ( fig.1(c ) ) @xcite .",
    "all this lead to a suggestion that negative curvature in zone of bounces is required for the described type of chaotic behavior , though more effort is needed for better understanding this connection .",
    "the main goal of this section is to claim that another type ( different from described in introduction ) of regular dynamics exists for the system ( 3)(4 ) .",
    "this type of dynamics is known for a variety of dynamical systems [ 1518 ] .",
    "we have found it in the cosmological dynamics ( @xmath40 ) with shallow potentials . in a general situation",
    "this behavior exists even for quadratic potential if the constant @xmath53 from the constraint equation ( 5 ) is sufficiently large and negative . in all our numerical studies we use the units @xmath54 .",
    "separate intervals of initial scale factors merge.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ f4 ]    it has been already reported that in these two cases the picture of chaotic dynamics changes significantly in comparison with the cosmological case of power - law potentials . in fig.2",
    "we reproduce the plot from @xcite , where zones in initial condition space leading to at least one bounce is shown for the potential @xmath44 and negative @xmath53 .",
    "a trajectory starts at the point of maximal expansion , so @xmath22 , and using the constraint equation ( 5 ) for eliminating @xmath55 we get 2-dimensional space of initial conditions ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in fig.4 the @xmath57 section of this space is shown depending on @xmath53 . when some bands , being separate for small @xmath58 merge with @xmath58 increasing , structure of trajectories changes .",
    "trajectories starting from the wide zone formed by merged bands show complicated behavior , which can not be described in a simple way , like in the @xmath40 case . that is why this type of behavior have been called as `` strong '' or `` less ordered '' chaos .",
    "however , the dynamical behavior in this case appeared to be even more complicated in the sense that islands of regular dynamics can be distinguished in a chaotic `` sea '' .    to see this",
    "we have studied an appropriate poincare section , taking for this purpose a point of maximal expansion , i.e. the point with @xmath59 , @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "3 the points of this poincare section are plotted for quadratic scalar field potential with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "initial values of the scale factor in the point of maximal expansion vary from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "island of regular dynamics is easily distinguishable .",
    "it should be pointed out that this regular regime is of completely different nature than regular dynamics for a steep scalar field potential .",
    "now we can see a quasi - periodic behavior , and trajectories from this part of the phase space never fall into a singularity .",
    "a particular strongly stable periodical trajectory exists for initial @xmath65 ( in general , this value is a function of @xmath53 ) .    in the vicinity of this trajectory",
    "the points of poincare sections form rather regular ovals , those from more distant orbits show some structure in their poincare set . in the transition zone between regular and chaotic zones nontrivial structures can appear , like shown in fig .",
    "we can see a poincare set consisting of 9 disconnected ovals .",
    "structure of zone between chaos and regularity requires further investigations .    , @xmath61 , the constant @xmath62 .",
    "regular structure around initial @xmath66 is clearly seen.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    [ f5 ]    we have seen similar islands of regularity in the cosmological solutions ( i. e. with @xmath40 ) of the system ( 3)(4 ) with a family of shallow damour - mukhanov potentials @xcite studied with respect to their chaotic properties in @xcite .",
    "this family has the form @xmath67.\\ ] ] with three parameters  @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and interpolates between a quadratic form of the potential for small @xmath8 and a power - law form @xmath71 for large @xmath8 .",
    "it was found numerically that the described event of bounce band merging exists for a subfamily of ( 13 ) with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is some function of @xmath69 @xcite . in the table",
    "below we compare @xmath75 with the value of @xmath76 for which the island of regularity appears ( it exists for @xmath77 ) .",
    "they are close enough , and it indicates that bounce zone merging is a good indicator of regularity in our system .",
    "the difference between these two values grows significantly only in the vicinity of the critical value of @xmath78 when this type of dynamics disappears for any @xmath79 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of stable periodical cosmological regime in general relativity ( other known stable examples like described in @xcite require modifications of einstein gravity , some other solutions periodic with respect to scale factor evolution in time are accompanied by a monotonic growth of a scalar field @xcite ) .",
    "this regular island is surrounded by a `` sea '' of chaotic trajectories . in general",
    "all of them are finite and end in a cosmological singularity , though existence of chaotic infinite trajectories of non - zero measure is not currently ruled out in our numerical studies .",
    "are the same as in fig.3.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    [ f6 ]",
    "we have studied local instability of trajectories representing evolution of a closed isotropic universe with a scalar field using the maupertuis principle .",
    "zones of positive and negative curvature @xmath36 of the configuration space are constructed .",
    "it is shown that the system in question is not a u - system , and there are zones with positive and negative @xmath36 .",
    "it is interesting that though zones with different sign of @xmath36 exist for both power - law and exponentially steep potential , in the latter case ( when the structure of a transient chaos is absent ) the configuration of zones differs qualitatively from the case of less steep potential ( when the chaos is present ) .",
    "our empirical data suggests that a crucial feature for chaos to exist is local instability of trajectories in the narrow zones when bounce can occur .",
    "a typical property of dynamical system with nonnegative @xmath36 is that their phase space contains positive - measured islands of regular dynamics @xcite .",
    "we show that the dynamics of this type exists in the case of sufficiently shallow potential as well as in another similar systems with merged bands of initial conditions leading to bounces .",
    "trajectories in these islands never reach the cosmological singularity , as well as inflationary regime , and have trapped for infinite time intervals in a certain zone of small scale factors .",
