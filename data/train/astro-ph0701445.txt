    "after the tp - agb phase is terminated , low to intermediate mass stars ( with initial masses @xmath6 to 8@xmath4 ) evolve through the pne phase before ending their lives as white dwarfs ( see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the whole envelope is lost by low - velocity stellar winds during the agb phase .",
    "the gaseous nebula is the remnant of the deep convective envelope that once surrounded the core , which is now exposed as the central star ( cs ) of the illuminated nebula .",
    "thus the abundances of the nebula should reveal information about the chemical processing that took place during the agb ; and more precisely , information about the last tps .",
    "the spectra of pne are usually a composite , a mixture from the nebula and the illuminating central star .",
    "accurate abundances from pne for helium , c , n , o , ne , s , cl and ar are available @xcite",
    ". these abundances can be used as a powerful tool to constrain models of agb stars @xcite , in particular the amount of mixing that occurs during third dredge - up ( tdu ) episodes following a tp .",
    "the discovery in pne of lines of the light neutron - capture element ge by @xcite provides not only constraints on the amount of dredge - up but also on the operation of the @xmath1 process occurring in agb stars . despite the solar ge abundance being dominated by massive - star nucleosynthesis , with agb stars only contributing 6% of solar ge @xcite",
    ", this element can be produced by the @xmath1-process in sufficient quantities to be observed in pne .    in this letter",
    "we seek to address the question of whether detailed models of agb stars can reproduce the observed amount of ge in pne .",
    "this study is timely given the increasing number of detections of heavy elements in pne and indeed this is the first study dedicated to comparing to these abundances . in a follow - up paper",
    "we will expand upon this work to cover all elements up to the first @xmath1-peak .",
    "the numerical method we use has been previously described in detail @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the main points relevant for this study .",
    "we compute the structure first and then perform detailed nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "the reaction network in the post - processing algorithm has been expanded from 74 species to 156 , to include all stable isotopes up to as .",
    "we include all @xmath7-decays up to arsenic , and all proton , @xmath8 and @xmath9 capture reactions on all species in the network , which results in a total of 1260 reaction rates .    to account for neutron",
    "captures on elements heavier than arsenic we use a `` double neutron - sink '' description @xcite , and include two artificial species which are linked by the following reactions as(@xmath10)g and g(@xmath11)g , where g replaces as , and has an initial abundance equal to the sum of solar abundances from se to bi .",
    "the second artificial particle , @xmath12 , is equivalent to counting the number of neutrons captured beyond arsenic .",
    "the ratio ( @xmath12/g ) is a description of the neutrons captured per seed nuclei and could in principle be related to the @xmath1-process distribution .",
    "most of the 1260 reaction rates are from the 1991 updated reaclib data tables @xcite .",
    "many of the proton , @xmath8 and @xmath9 capture - reaction rates have been updated by @xcite .",
    "we use the nacre @xcite rates for the nena and mgal chains , and rates from @xcite for the ne @xmath13 reactions .",
    "the cross - section of the g(@xmath11)g reaction is a composite calculated using heavy element distributions produced by the @xmath1 process in low - mass agb stars from the models of @xcite .",
    "test simulations show that using a different cross - section for g does not significantly effect the elemental abundance of ge ( or any other species ) in a 3@xmath4 , @xmath14 or a 2.5@xmath4 , @xmath15 model .",
    ".details of the stellar models.[models ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our results compare favorably with the 3 @xmath4 @xmath16 model computed with the franec evolutionary code @xcite by @xcite with their standard c pocket ( hereafter : the _ torino _ models ) , who finds the final [ ge / fe ] , [ ga / fe ] , [ zr / fe ] and [ ba / fe ] equal to 0.46 , 0.43 , 1.03 and 0.93 , respectively .",
    "the 1.5@xmath4 , @xmath16 produced values equal to 0.28 , 0.29 , 0.75 and 0.65 , respectively .",
    "the _ torino _ 5@xmath4 @xmath16 model produced a final [ ge / fe]=0.57 , higher than our equivalent model , owing to the choice of the @xcite mass loss ( with @xmath17 ) which results in more tps ( 48 ) compared to our computation ( 24 ) .",
    "massive agb stars have been suggested as the progenitors of type i bipolar pne owing to their high he and n / o abundances @xcite , as well as kinematics @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find a correlation between pne morphology and s - process overabundances , where elliptical pne are more enriched than bipolar pne , which show little or no enhancement .",
    "these observations suggest that reimers type mass loss is inadequate for modeling massive agb stars , and formulae with a superwind ( such as * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are favored .",
    "none of the agb models lost all of their envelopes before the computation finished .",
    "that is , all of the models were near the tip of the agb but had not proceeded to the post - agb phase .",
    "some of these models could in principle experience further tps and tdus , and we refer to these as _ extra tps_. the amount of ge expected after the @xmath18 tp can be estimated according to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass of ge dredged into the envelope , @xmath21 is the tdu efficiency and @xmath22 is the mass of ge in the intershell . in figure  [ intershell ]",
    "we show the intershell abundances for selected ge isotopes for two models .",
    "a ge pocket can be seen in both cases , and although this will be diluted by one order of magnitude by intershell convection , the post - pulse abundances are still enhanced compared to solar .    using the 3@xmath4 , @xmath23 model with a pmz of @xmath24 as an example , we estimate that the next tp would take place when @xmath25 .",
    "the mass of the he - intershell at the last tp is @xmath26 , and assuming the same tdu efficiency as in the previous tp , @xmath27 . at the last computed time - step , the ge envelope and intershell compositions are @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( in mass fractions ) respectively , from which we estimate that after the next tp [ ge / fe ] = 0.64 .",
    "if we assume a mass - loss rate of @xmath30 ( typical near the end of the agb ) multiplied by the interpulse period of 54,000 years then @xmath31 is lost per interpulse . from this",
    "we estimate that the final tp would occur when @xmath32 .",
    "we can speculate that if a tdu episode occurs with the same efficiency as before , and using the envelope and intershell ge abundances from the previous estimate ( @xmath33 ) , we get [ ge / fe ] = 0.90 ( or ge @xmath34 in mass fractions ) , at the tip of the agb , close to the value required to match the composition of the most ge - enriched pne .",
    "however caution is required because this value is very likely to be an overestimate , owing to the evidence for a decreasing tdu efficiency with a decreasing envelope mass @xcite .",
    "variations in agb mass - loss rates and model - dependent parameters such as the interpulse period will also effect this estimate .    increasing the size of the pmz in the models produces more ge but if we increase the size of the pocket too much we run into the problem that the pmz accounts for a large percentage of the intershell region .",
    "this is contrary to simulations which suggest that the c pocket should be at most @xmath35 10% of the intershell @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this letter show that agb models can explain the spread of ge abundance in pne from solar to a factor of @xmath35 10 above solar , if we allow for the contribution of extra tps not modeled in detail .",
    "most detailed models produced ge overabundances up to a factor of @xmath36 , corresponding to a dilution of 1 part of he - intershell material per roughly 20 parts of envelope material .",
    "hence , we can easily account for the ge composition of the majority of the observations , in particular taking into account that substantial observational uncertainties arise from the choice of the level of dust depletion .",
    "even for the mostly ge - enriched pne ( swst  1 and bd @xmath37303639 ) , for which ge enhancements have been estimated to be up to a factor of 30 , ( but could also be as low as @xmath38 5 if a lower dust depletion is assumed * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , it is conceivable that these overabundances could be reproduced by considering in more detail the effects of stellar model uncertainties , such as the mass loss and treatment of mixing processes which affect the tdu in particular .",
    "the relation between pne with h - deficient css and those with the largest ge abundances could be explained if a late tp during the post - agb phase ( when the envelope mass decreases below @xmath39 ) , was responsible for both .",
    "these events , described by @xcite , cause the cs to become ( partially ) h - deficient by mixing and/or burning the small remaining envelope with the larger he - intershell , which is enriched in he - burning and s - process products .",
    "however such a scenario would also produce larger enhancements of the other @xmath1-process elements in this type of pne , while observations show that , on average , the enrichment of kr and se in pne with h - deficient cs are not significantly different from other pne @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently presented abundances for br , kr and xe derived from pne observations .",
    "for all of these other elements , which we will discuss in detail in a forthcoming paper , results from the _ torino _ code generally produce a good match with the observations ( except in the case of br which is not observed to be enhanced in pne contrary to model predictions ) , with higher enrichments obtained at lower metallicities , as in the case of ge discussed here . on the other hand , tentative evidence for the late tp scenario could come from bd @xmath37303639 , with enhanced ge and an fe - deficient cs @xcite , possibly indicating a high level of mixing of @xmath1-processed material .",
    "further study of the stellar model uncertainties and the extra and/or late tp scenario together with more accurate observations are needed before anything more conclusive can be said .",
