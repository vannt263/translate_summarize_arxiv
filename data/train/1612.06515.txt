    "a period of accelerated expansion during the very early stage of the universe called inflation is able to account for several otherwise difficult to explain features of the observed universe .",
    "a simplest inflation model is based on a single slowly - rolling scalar field canonically coupled ( cc ) to gravity  @xcite . in the standard picture of the early universe",
    ", the universe passes through the period of reheating after the end of inflation .    the nonminimal derivative coupling ( ndc )  @xcite was firstly notified by coupling the inflaton kinetic term to the einstein tensor such that the friction is gravitationally enhanced  @xcite .",
    "later , this coupling has been considered as an alternative mechanism to increase friction of an inflaton rolling down its own potential .",
    "actually , it makes a non - flat potential adequate for inflation without introducing ghost state  @xcite .",
    "this implies that during inflation , the ndc increases friction , and flattens the potential effectively .",
    "it is meaningful to note that there was a difference between cc and ndc even for taking the same quadratic potential  @xcite .",
    "the difference appears clearly in the reheating process after the end of inflation .",
    "reheating is being considered as an important part of inflationary universe because it describes the production of standard model particles after the inflation  @xcite . at this stage ,",
    "the classical periodic oscillating inflaton @xmath2 in the cc decays into massive bosons is due to parametric resonance  @xcite .",
    "in order to explain this phenomenon by introducing an interacting lagrangian of @xmath3 , the equation for quantum field @xmath4 can be reduced to the mathieu equation  @xcite , which is the well - known differential equation with periodic mass term when neglecting the expansion of the universe .",
    "this equation describes a harmonic oscillator with variable frequency ( parametric oscillator ) . in particular ,",
    "if the coupling @xmath5 is large enough , the periodic modulation of the field mass leads to strong instability via parametric resonance .    on the other hand ,",
    "the inflaton in the ndc oscillates with time - dependent frequency which is surely a non - periodic function . the average solution @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ ave - sol2 ] ) mimics the non - periodic nature of the inflation observed in ref .",
    "@xcite numerically .",
    "therefore , the equation of quantum field @xmath4 does not take a form of the mathieu equation , and its solution could not be obtained analytically .",
    "however , the author in ref .",
    "@xcite has recently claimed that the parametric resonance instability is absent , by solving this equation with quadratic potential approximately .    in this work",
    ", we wish to revisit this important issue because the inflaton of the ndc should describe the slow - roll inflation as well as the preheating stage after the end of inflation .",
    "we will argue that there is no ( narrow , broad ) parametric resonance after the end of inflation in the ndc model because the field mass term is not a periodic function",
    ". we will also numerically confirm it by solving the ndc - equation for @xmath6 and by comparing those obtained from the mathieu equation .",
