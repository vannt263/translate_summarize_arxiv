    "as materials and device growth techniques mature and improve , it becomes more possible to create artificial systems , composed of well - defined numbers of flat planes of one material grown on top of another material .",
    "a device can be engineered by determining the different kinds of materials to grow and the thicknesses of the different multilayers .",
    "if we assume the growth process is perfect , so the planes are atomically flat , with no interface roughness , then we have an inhomogeneous quantum - mechanical problem to solve for the behavior of electrons in the system , where the inhomogeneity lies in one dimension only .",
    "the properties of devices grown in this fashion are more complicated if some or all of the materials that make up the device are composed of strongly correlated electron materials , where the properties of the electrons can not be described solely by an independent - particle picture like band theory .",
    "these systems are increasing in interest because bulk strongly correlated materials exhibit exotic phenomena , and show promise in demonstrating high tunability of their properties .",
    "what is less studied is how these properties can be modified by confinement / deconfinement effects that are possible in multilayered nanostructures .",
    "in addition , there has been little theoretical development of the thermal transport effects in such multilayered systems .",
    "some evidence from examining the interface between two materials , indicates that thermal transport effects in inhomogeneous systems can create large enhancements to the performance@xcite , but the theory has not been fully developed within a kubo - like context which allows the many - body aspects to be treated fully .",
    "semiclassical approaches have also been employed@xcite , but that theory is also inadequate to treat strongly correlated materials .",
    "finally , the important problem of phonon transport in such systems has been examined extensively , but is beyond the scope of what we cover in this work .",
    "one of the most important results in bulk thermal transport is the jonson - mahan theorem@xcite , which provides an exact relationship between different thermal transport coefficients .",
    "using the jonson - mahan theorem makes calculation of the thermal transport only slightly more complicated than the calculation of the charge transport , and has enabled much of the theoretical work in strongly correlated thermoelectrics .",
    "here we show how to generalize the jonson - mahan theorem to multilayered nanostructures , which also greatly simplifies the calculation of the thermal transport coefficients .",
    "the idea to use multilayered nanostructures , or more complicated geometries , for enhancing thermoelectric performance of refrigerators or power generators was proposed@xcite in the 1990s and enhancements have been seen recently@xcite .",
    "the focus in that work was along the ideas of an electron - crystal - phonon - glass approach , where the nanostructures are engineered to preserve the electronic properties , while making the phonon transport similar to that in a disordered glass .",
    "it is possible that one can actually employ the nanostructure engineering to produce _ enhancements _ to the electronic transport properties , while simultaneously reducing the phonon thermal transport , so this basic approach may be pushed further than theorized in the original presentations .",
    "one key to being able to enhance the electronic properties , is to be able to tune the electron correlation properties with a proper engineering of the nanostructure and to engineer the charge redistribution at the interfaces . before initiating such a program",
    ", one needs to be able to properly calculate the thermal transport in a strongly correlated device , and we derive the formalism for how to do this here .",
    "the systems we describe in this work involve multilayered devices constructed of atomically flat planes which can be composed of different materials .",
    "each system is inhomogeneous in the @xmath0-direction , which is the direction where the planes are stacked .",
    "we take the left lead to be identical to the right lead , so the system will have a `` mirror symmetry '' , and the device will have its chemical potential determined by that of the bulk leads .",
    "we use roman letters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ... ) to denote the lattice sites within each plane ( _ i .",
    ", the @xmath3 coordinates ) , and greek letters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , ... ) to denote the individual planes ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath0-coordinate ) .",
    "we require the system to be translationally invariant within each plane , and for the lattice structure of each plane to be identical , so that the connection between planes is between corresponding sites in the two planes , and is the same for each site .",
    "the latter requirement is by no means necessary , but it greatly simplifies the notation for the formalism , so we adopt it here .",
    "we will consider three different types of hamiltonians here : ( i ) the hubbard model@xcite ; ( ii ) the falicov - kimball model@xcite ; and ( iii ) the periodic anderson model@xcite .",
    "we use a multiple index @xmath6 to denote the @xmath1th planar site on plane @xmath4 . in the hubbard model , we have conduction electrons , whose creation and annihilation operators are denoted @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , for electrons sitting at the lattice site denoted by @xmath6 and with @xmath0-component of spin @xmath9 .",
    "the falicov - kimball model has two kinds of electrons : conduction electrons ( which are described by similar operators as in the hubbard model , but without spin , for simplicity ) and localized electrons ( also chosen to be spinless and created or destroyed by the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "the periodic anderson model has spin - one - half conduction and @xmath12-electrons , which are denoted by the familiar operators , except now all operators will have spin labels .",
    "all models can be expressed as the sum of two terms in the hamiltonian  an inhomogeneous hopping term and an interaction - hybridization term .",
    "the inhomogeneous hopping term is essentially the same for all three models .",
    "it is @xmath13 where we do not include a sum over spin for the spinless falicov - kimball model .",
    "we assume the hopping matrices are real symmetric matrices , and one should note that the hopping between planes is only between neighboring planes and between corresponding sites within the two planes .",
    "the magnitudes of the hopping matrices within the planes and between the planes can vary , but the planar hopping matrices must be translationally invariant to go to a mixed momentum - space  real - space basis , which is commonly done in these types of problems . if the planes are square - lattice planes , then the underlying lattice topology will be that of a simple cubic lattice , but the hopping need not be the same everywhere .",
    "the interaction - hybridization term is different for each model . for the hubbard model",
    "it is @xmath14 for the spinless falicov - kimball model it is @xmath15 and for the periodic anderson model it is @xmath16 for the falicov - kimball model , we often replace the term @xmath17 by the symbol @xmath18 which equals 0 if no localized electrons are at site @xmath6 and equals 1 if a localized electron is at site @xmath6 .",
    "all interaction and hybridization terms can vary from plane to plane , but they must be the same for every lattice site within the planes to preserve translational invariance within the planes .",
    "the total hamiltonian is then @xmath19 for all of the models .",
    "the symbol @xmath20 is the chemical potential , and @xmath21 denotes the electron number operator , chosen to be the total conduction electron number operator for the hubbard and falicov - kimball models and the total electron number operator for the periodic anderson model ( we work in a canonical ensemble for the @xmath12-electrons in the falicov - kimball model , so no site - energy or chemical potential is needed for those particles ) .    in section",
    "ii , we present a description of electronic charge reconstruction , which naturally occurs in any multilayered device that can be grown for thermoelectric properties .",
    "this section briefly reviews the current status of such calculations , and describes their impact on the thermal transport ; in particular , it fixes the notation for the internal electrostatic potentials associated with the electronic charge reconstruction .",
    "section iii provides the main arguments for developing the multilayered generalization of the jonson - mahan theorem .",
    "section iv applies the formalism to three classic experiments ",
    "the peltier effect , the seebeck effect , and the thermal conductivity .",
    "section v presents our conclusions and describes areas for further work .",
    "the schottky effect  @xcite , is a well - known effect in the semiconductor community , where charge is redistributed between a semiconductor and a metal at a semiconductor - metal interface due to a bulk chemical potential mismatch between the two materials .",
    "the charge rearrangement creates a screened dipole layer at the interface resulting in a final state with a static inhomogeneous redistribution of charge through the system .",
    "recently , the phenomenon has been revisited in the context of strongly correlated materials  @xcite , where it has been called electronic charge reconstruction  @xcite .",
    "if we imagine a multilayered nanostructure , composed of metallic leads sandwiching a barrier region , which is a strongly correlated material , then the chemical potential of the device is fixed by the chemical potential of the leads .",
    "if the chemical potential of the barrier is different , then the system must undergo an electronic charge reconstruction . in particular",
    ", since the temperature dependence of the chemical potential should be different in the two different materials , even if the chemical potentials match at one temperature , they will not match at other temperatures , and a charge redistribution will take place .    in this work , we will focus on problems that have `` mirror symmetry '' for the leads , so the lead to the left is made of the same material as the lead to the right . in this case",
    ", the total coulomb potential energy , due to all electric fields , goes to zero when one is far from the interfaces , because all of the charge rearrangement is localized at the interfaces , and the whole system is charge neutral .",
    "if we were to examine systems with different materials for the left and right leads , then the electrochemical potential of the system will be the average of the left and right bulk chemical potentials , which creates some additional complications , but does not change the basic strategies or formulas , although , the seebeck effect needs to be defined and analyzed with care@xcite .",
    "the approach to describe the electronic charge reconstruction is a semiclassical one .",
    "we solve the problem for local electron interactions exactly , but treat the long - range coulomb interaction in a mean - field fashion .",
    "the strategy we use is to first calculate the electronic charge on each plane via an inhomogeneous green s function approach ( in dynamical mean - field theory , the technique of potthoff and nolting  @xcite is used ) .",
    "if possible , one uses a matsubara - frequency approach , because the numerics are usually under better control than real - axis approaches , but this is just a matter of convenience , not necessity .",
    "next , we find the charge deviation on each plane ; namely , we determine whether extra charge has entered or left the plane .",
    "since the positive background charge of the ions remains the same , the charge deviation will give rise to an electric field .",
    "there are two different ways to treat this field .",
    "the simplest is to assume the electric charge is uniformly spread over the plane  @xcite .",
    "then the electric field is constant , perpendicular to the plane , and pointing away from it in both directions if the net charge density is positive , while pointing toward the plane if the net charge density is negative .",
    "the second method uses the actual distribution of the ions , and the spatial profile of the electrons , if available , to calculate the charge  @xcite .",
    "this approach is closer to an ewald - like summation  @xcite of the charge densities .",
    "the two treatments should yield similar results .    in this work",
    ", we will choose the `` constant plane of charge '' description for determining the electric fields .",
    "this allows us to determine simple analytic expressions for the electric fields  for example , the magnitude of the constant field , emanating from the @xmath4th plane of charge is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the charge of the electron , @xmath24 is the quantum - mechanically calculated electron number density at plane @xmath4 , @xmath25 is the bulk electron number density for the material that plane @xmath4 is composed of ( equal to the positive background charge on the plane ) , @xmath26 is the permittivity of free space , and @xmath27 is the relative permittivity of plane @xmath4 .",
    "the contribution to the electric potential @xmath28 from this field satisfies @xmath29 since the electric field is constant in magnitude , it is straightforward to compute the contribution to the coulomb potential at plane @xmath5 due to the change in the charge density at plane @xmath4 ( but one needs to keep track of the signs of the fields or equivalently the relative order of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath5 ) : @xmath30 , & \\quad\\beta>\\alpha\\\\ 0,&\\quad\\beta=\\alpha\\\\ \\sum_{\\gamma=\\alpha-1}^\\beta [ \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon_{\\rm r \\gamma } } + \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon_{\\rm r \\gamma+1 } } ] , & \\quad\\beta<\\alpha \\end{array}\\right . .",
    "\\label{eq : potential_ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that if the relative permittivity @xmath31 is a constant , independent of the planes , then the potential energy is a linear function of the @xmath0-coordinate , proportional to @xmath32 as one might expect .",
    "the reason why we need to sum over two terms in the summands in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential_ab ] ) is because we envision the @xmath4th plane of charge to be infinitesimally thick , and go through the lattice sites of plane @xmath4 , but we assume the dielectric has a thickness of @xmath33 and is centered around each plane of atoms .",
    "hence , if the permittivity changes from one plane to another , a polarization charge develops halfway between the two planes where the dielectric is changing , and the electric field has a discontinuity at that point ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , at the position @xmath34 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : pol_charge ] ) .     and @xmath35 .",
    "assuming the net surface charge density on plane @xmath4 is @xmath36 ( located along the plane running through position @xmath4 ) and the relative permittivity is @xmath37 ( and similarly for the @xmath35 plane ) , then the change in polarization at the interface between the two dielectric planes induces a polarization charge on the interface ( denoted @xmath38 ) that leads to a discontinuous jump in the electric field halfway between the two lattice planes ( at the position @xmath34 ) .",
    "once the fields are known , we integrate to get the electric potentials .",
    "note the discontinuity in the electric field occurs at the _ midpoint _ between the two lattice planes .",
    "[ fig : pol_charge],width=288 ]    it is actually the potential energy @xmath39 that shifts the chemical potential at each planar site .",
    "we define a parameter @xmath40 which controls how the extra charge density decays away from the interfaces .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 has the units of an energy multiplied by an area ; the product of @xmath41 with the local density of states has units of the inverse of a length , and this is what determines the decay length of the charge profile . using this parameter",
    ", we can immediately calculate the potential energy due to the coulomb interaction ( evaluated in a mean - field fashion ) @xmath42 , & \\quad\\beta>\\alpha\\\\ 0,&\\quad\\beta=\\alpha\\\\ \\sum_{\\gamma=\\alpha-1}^\\beta \\frac{1}{2 } [ e_{\\rm schot}(\\gamma)+e_{\\rm schot}(\\gamma+1 ) ] , & \\quad\\beta<\\alpha \\end{array}\\right . .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that a similar analysis can be carried out if one uses the ewald - like technique for determining the charge reconstruction .",
    "these potential energies modify the hamiltonian by the long - range coulomb interaction of the charge reconstruction .",
    "the additional piece of the hamiltonian ( due to the charge rearrangement ) is @xmath43 hence , they can be treated by shifting the chemical potential @xmath44 on each plane depending on what the coulomb potential energy is for the given plane . for consistency",
    ", we must have that the potentials go to zero as we move far enough into either of the leads ( for the mirror - symmetric case ) .",
    "this requirement enforces overall charge conservation  any charge that moves out of the barrier remains in the leads , localized close to the interface , and _",
    "vice versa_. of course , the potentials @xmath45 that appear in the electronic charge reconstruction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : charge_ham ] ) must be determined self - consistently .",
    "achieving this goal requires care in setting up the iterative algorithm .",
    "there will be no electronic charge reconstruction if the chemical potentials in the bulk of both the leads and the barrier match . in order to have freedom to adjust the mismatch of the chemical potentials , we need to be able to change the value of the band zero of the barrier region relative to the band zero of the leads .",
    "this parameter is called @xmath46 , which vanishes in the leads , and is generically a nonzero constant in the barrier ( independent of the temperature or the charge rearrangement ) .",
    "hence we add an additional term @xmath47 to the hamiltonian .",
    "although this term appears similar to the coulomb potential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : charge_ham ] ) , the key observation is that this term is fixed and does not change with any parameters of the system , whereas the plane potentials @xmath45 need to be readjusted as the parameters change , to achieve a self - consistent solution of the problem .",
    "note that we set @xmath48 in the leads to the right and to the left .",
    ", width=336 ]    in this contribution , we will not discuss how to actually solve for the electronic charge reconstruction in detail .",
    "one can imagine a number of different approaches to this problem , ranging from direct means of solving the quantum - mechanical problem on finite - sized stacked planes , to other techniques like the inhomogeneous dynamical mean - field theory approach .",
    "the dmft approach has been quite successful in examining these kinds of problems , and the formalism only requires that the self - energy remain local ( although it can vary from plane to plane ) . then , by performing a fourier transform to momentum space for the planar coordinates , one decouples the planar motion from the longitudinal motion .",
    "hence , the problem reduces to a series of quasi - one - dimensional inhomogeneous problems , which can be solved by using the renormalized perturbation expansion@xcite ( sometimes called the quantum zipper algorithm@xcite ) .",
    "details for such an approach have already appeared@xcite and are briefly reviewed below .    the dmft algorithm is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmft_algorithm3 ] .",
    "if there is a separate algorithm available for the matsubara frequency green s functions , then the upper left loop ( which determines the electronic charge reconstruction ) is used on the imaginary axis , and we do nt need it on the real axis . if such an algorithm does not exist ( such as when calculations are performed with the numerical renormalization group ) , then we would use the entire loop on the real axis . the new steps to find the electronic charge reconstruction",
    "are to first find the electron density on each plane .",
    "then we subtract the bulk charge density of each plane to find the excess or deficit charge on the given plane .",
    "once the change in charge density is known , we can calculate the electrical potential , and then the contribution to the potential energy .",
    "this gets added to the chemical potential to determine the electrochemical potential at each plane .",
    "when numerical results are generated  @xcite ( see those references for numerical issues in the algorithm ) , we find that usually the electronic charge reconstruction does not change significantly at low temperature , and that the size of the charge deviation grows as the mismatch between the chemical potentials grows ( governed in part by the size of @xmath46 in the barrier ) .",
    "such results are similar to what one would expect , but most of the calculations have taken place in systems where the charge density is not too sensitive to changes in the chemical potential",
    ". the effects may be different in systems with either mott insulators , or doped mott insulators , which can be brought close to the insulating phase via the electronic charge reconstruction .",
    "in addition , electron - phonon coupled systems can develop a strong sensitivity of the charge to the chemical potential when the coupling is large , which may be an interesting case to examine as well .",
    "ultimately , we are most interested in the transport of charge and heat through the device . in order to calculate the transport ,",
    "we need to evaluate the real - axis results for the self - energies and green s functions of a nanostructure with an electronic charge reconstruction . unfortunately ,",
    "the algorithms used when there is no electronic charge reconstruction  @xcite can not be simply employed for this case .",
    "the reason why is that the presence of the different potentials @xmath45 on each plane causes the nature of the integrands over the two - dimensional density of states to have a different singular behavior than they had before . in a system without electronic charge reconstruction , the singularities in the integrand could be square - root - like , which are removed by a simple variable change using trigonometric or hyperbolic functions . now , the singularities are poles ( because the denominators are shifted by the potentials at a given plane , so they vanish at different energies , and give rise to a different singular behavior ) , and we need to evaluate all integrals in a principal - value sense , where the real part is integrated with a symmetric grid around each pole , and the imaginary part has a delta - function contribution that needs to be included .",
    "this is challenging to implement numerically , because the locations of the poles are different on different planes , and can vary from one iteration to the next .",
    "details for how to deal with such a sophistication will appear elsewhere , since they are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is important to examine how the linear - response transport formalism@xcite is modified by the presence of an electronic charge reconstruction .",
    "we have taken the chemical potential as a constant throughout the multilayered nanostructure for thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "one can directly show that the device carries no longitudinal charge current even though there are nonzero electric fields arising from the electronic charge reconstruction ( see appendix a for a proof when the self - energy is local ) .",
    "no current flows because the putative current driven by the internal electric fields is canceled by an equal magnitude but oppositely directed current driven by the concentration gradients .",
    "the standard way to describe this result is via a phenomenological equation ( for the case with no thermal gradients )  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the diffusion constant for fick s law of diffusion  @xcite , and the second equality follows from the einstein relation  @xcite ( or more correctly the nernst - einstein - smoluchowski relation  @xcite ) which relates the diffusion constant to the conductivity via @xmath51 both quantities are matrices , with indices given by the planes of the multilayered nanostructure .",
    "the symbol @xmath52 is called the electrochemical potential .",
    "the einstein relation can be derived by relating the gradient with respect to the chemical potential to the gradient with respect to the number concentration via the chain rule : @xmath53 , and the fact that the current vanishes in equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : onsager_phenom ] ) implies that the condition for there to be no charge current is simply @xmath54 .",
    "the chemical potential is a constant , but it does vary with the filling , so if there is a change in electron concentration , then @xmath55 , so the force from the electric field will be balanced by the force from the change in electron concentration . in addition , note that the current vanishes no matter how large the variation in the concentration is ( _ i .",
    "e. _ , beyond the linear - response regime ) , so the conclusion is that the current generated by the internal electric field is always canceled by the current generated by the change in the electron concentration .",
    "hence , for a linear - response treatment of transport , we can ignore the forces due to the internal electric fields and the concentration gradients , because they always cancel , and we can limit our focus to the effects of the external electric field only .",
    "this then implies that all of the analysis performed previously for the charge current@xcite continues to be valid , and because the form of the charge current is unchanged when we have electronic charge reconstruction , the kubo formula is identical as it was before ( with the effects of the potentials @xmath45 included , of course ) .",
    "the basic observation needed for a thermoelectric device is that there is a difference between the weighting factors that determine the bulk charge current and heat current .",
    "the charge current is weighted by the electron velocity , while the heat current is weighted by the velocity multiplied by the kinetic energy minus the chemical potential plus a term from the potential energy .",
    "hence , one can create charge current without heat current , or _",
    "vice versa _ ; by carefully engineering the way electrons move through the device , one can control both the energy and charge flow , which is useful for different types of applications like refrigeration or power generation .",
    "a typical device has two legs , one using electrons as the charge carriers and one using holes as the charge carriers .",
    "current flows through the device in a loop , but the net heat flows in one direction only , which allows the device to function .    in this contribution , we concentrate on multilayered nanostructures , which can be used to compose one of the legs of the thermoelectric device .",
    "we also concentrate solely on electronic transport mechanisms . in most thermoelectrics ,",
    "the thermal conductivity from phonons can be large enough to significantly reduce the figure - of - merit .",
    "it is expected that the phonon thermal conductivity will be further reduced in a nanostructure , because the interfaces in the nanostructures will cause significant phonon scattering if the masses of the ions in the different materials have a large mismatch  @xcite , but we do not discuss this issue further .",
    "there is no simple way to derive the response of a strongly correlated system to both electrical fields and thermal gradients .",
    "the reason why is that the thermal gradient can not be added as a field to the hamiltonian like the electric field can , hence there is no way to follow the simple kubo response theory developed for the charge current in an electric field ( because the linear - response approach evaluates correlation functions at a fixed temperature , and a variation of the temperature with position is problematic to include within the formalism ) .",
    "luttinger sorted out a reasonable plan of action for how one can nevertheless proceed@xcite .",
    "we couple a fictitious field to the heat - current operator , analogous to the vector potential that couples to the charge current operator , and determine the linear response with respect to both fields .",
    "then , we compare the kubo response to a phenomenological set of equations that relate the charge and heat currents to the electric field and the gradient of the temperature .",
    "we then identify the relevant transport coefficients and how they are expressed in terms of correlation functions .    in multilayered nanostructures",
    ", there always is an electronic charge reconstruction , because the bulk chemical potentials for the leads and the barrier will have different @xmath56 dependence , and hence can not always be equal ( the only exception is for particle - hole symmetry at half - filling , but there the thermopower vanishes , so that case is uninteresting for thermal transport ) .",
    "hence the hamiltonian must be modified to include the potential energy @xmath45 on each plane , and the band offsets @xmath57 , as described in sec .",
    "e. _ , we add @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the band offsets are independent of @xmath56 , and represent the difference in the band zeroes for the leads and the material placed at plane @xmath4 .",
    "the potential energies @xmath60 do depend on @xmath56 , but they do not create any currents , because they correspond to the static potential associated with the electronic charge reconstruction ( and the diffusion current generated by the change in electron concentration cancels the current from the internal electric field ; see appendix a ) .",
    "but the coulomb potentials do create internal electric fields that maintain the electronic charge redistribution amongst the planes .",
    "the phenomenological study of currents caused by external electric fields or temperature gradients has been examined since the early 1800s .",
    "it was found that an electric field can drive a charge current ( which is essentially ohm s law  @xcite with the conductivity as the phenomenological constant ) and it can drive a heat current because the electrons carry heat with them as they move through the material ( this phenomenon is called the peltier effect  @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , a temperature gradient can drive heat conduction with the phenomenological thermal conductivity ( called fourier s law  @xcite ) , and because the electronic contribution to the heat current generically carries charge , a temperature gradient can generate a charge current ( called the seebeck effect  @xcite ) .",
    "the phenomenological equations for the ( linear response ) longitudinal transport in a multilayered nanostructure are then ( @xmath61 is the longitudinal number current , @xmath62 is the longitudinal charge current , and @xmath63 is the longitudinal heat current ) @xmath64\\nonumber\\\\ & + & |e|a\\sum_\\beta l_{12\\alpha\\beta } \\frac{t_{\\beta+1}-t_\\beta}{at_\\beta } , \\label{eq : charge_phenom}\\\\ \\langle j_\\alpha^{\\rm q}\\rangle&= & -a\\sum_\\beta l_{21\\alpha\\beta}\\left [ \\frac{d\\mu_\\beta}{dt } \\frac{t_{\\beta+1}-t_\\beta}{a}+|e|e_\\beta\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & -&a\\sum_\\beta l_{22\\alpha\\beta } \\frac{t_{\\beta+1}-t_\\beta}{at_\\beta},\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : heat_phenom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the planar sites ( or the midpoint between planar sites , as clarified below ) , the term @xmath65 is the discretized approximation to the temperature gradient and the @xmath66 coefficients can be thought of as the phenomenological parameters .",
    "we define the symbol @xmath67 , which may be thought of as the `` local chemical potential '' for plane @xmath5 .",
    "the origin of the temperature derivative of @xmath68 entering into the phenomenological equations arises from the conventional @xmath69 term , which becomes @xmath70 when the system is placed in a thermal gradient .",
    "the spatial derivative of the @xmath71 terms does not drive any current , because it cancels with the current driven by the equilibrium concentration gradient ( which we did not include in the above phenomenological equations ) , so the electric field @xmath72 is the _ external field _ applied to the device ( this is valid only in the linear - response regime of a small external electric field ) .",
    "note , that there is a simple way to understand the signs that appear in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : charge_phenom ] ) and ( [ eq : heat_phenom ] ) . first consider the external electric field , which can be written as the negative gradient of the electric potential .",
    "the current ( whether of electrons or of holes ) , always runs down the potential hill . since the conductivity is always positive , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : charge_phenom ] ) must have a positive sign .",
    "the thermoelectric number current also runs downhill , so it is proportional to the negative temperature gradient . for electrons ,",
    "the charge current is @xmath73 times the number current , which gives rise to the positive sign for the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : charge_phenom ] ) .",
    "similarly , the thermal conductivity runs down the temperature `` hill '' , so it has a negative sign in front of it .",
    "the peltier effect term is the hardest to understand , but because the electrons are negatively charged , they actually move up the potential hill ( the charge current runs down the hill because the electrons are negatively charged ) , so the heat is carried up the hill , and hence there is a minus sign in front of the term ( recall the electric field is the negative gradient of the potential ) .",
    "our next step is to determine how to represent the thermal transport coefficients @xmath66 in terms of many - body correlation functions .",
    "this has already been done for the first coefficient@xcite , which is proportional to the conductivity matrix , and is represented by a current - current correlation function : @xmath74 ( the modification of the hamiltonian by the electronic charge reconstruction has no effect on the form of the charge current , or on the form of the correlations functions , but obviously creates additional scattering ) .",
    "since this coefficient arises from an electric field , which can be added to the hamiltonian , the derivation is rigorous .",
    "similarly , if we follow all the steps in ref .   that led up to the derivation of the conductivity matrix , but we examined the expectation value of the heat - current operator instead of the charge - current operator , we would find that the @xmath75 correlation function was identical to the @xmath76 correlation function except that it is a heat - current  charge - current correlation function instead of a charge - current  charge - current correlation function .",
    "as we discussed above , there is no complete theory to determine the @xmath77 and @xmath78 coefficients for the phenomenological transport equations .",

    "keeping within this same vein , the natural conclusion is that the final transport coefficient @xmath78 is a heat - current  heat - current correlation function ( but there is no rigorous derivation of this result ) .    in order to derive the local charge and heat current operators",
    ", we must formulate the transport problem in real space . unlike the bulk case , where the procedure is completely well - defined , there are a number of different possible ways to try to derive the local current operators .",
    "the bulk number current operator is found by taking the commutator of the number polarization operator with the hamiltonian ; this guarantees that the equation of continuity holds , and it also implies that the number current is conserved through the system .",
    "the number polarization operator is @xmath80 where we dropped the spin index for simplicity , and where @xmath81 is the position vector of the site labeled by @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath82 term enters for the falicov - kimball and periodic anderson models , but not for the hubbard model .",
    "since the number polarization operator depends only on the number operators , it commutes with all number operators in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "it turns out that the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : number_pol ] ) also commutes with the hybridization term in the periodic anderson model because the hybridization is on - site only .",
    "hence , the bulk number current operator is the same for all models we examine here , and arises solely from the commutator of the @xmath0-component of the polarization operator with the hopping hamiltonian .",
    "performing the commutator is straightforward , and leads to @xmath83 with @xmath84 note that the subscript @xmath4 on the current operator denotes the total current operator flowing through the @xmath4th plane , and does not indicate a cartesian coordinate of the current operator ; the current operator is always taken in the @xmath0-direction for the longitudinal flow .",
    "the current at plane @xmath4 is thus defined to be the total number of electrons flowing to the left minus the total flowing to the right ( here the current operator at plane @xmath4 is determined by the number of electrons flowing to the right or to the left through the @xmath4th and @xmath35st planes ) .",
    "a comment is in order about the choice given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : current_long ] ) for the current associated with the @xmath4th plane .",
    "note that the form chosen is not the same as the choice that would arise from taking the commutator of the `` local '' polarization operator ( at the @xmath4th plane ) with the hamiltonian .",
    "the direct result from the commutator @xmath85 $ ] @xmath86z_{\\alpha } , \\label{eq : current_loc_alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] does not seem reasonable , because it is weighted by the @xmath0-coordinate of the @xmath4th plane , rather than involving the difference of currents moving in opposite directions ( at the @xmath4th plane ) .",
    "when we have full translational symmetry , we derive the conventional form for the current operator by shifting the spatial index of one of the terms , to explicitly carry out the cancellation of the spatial coordinates ( just take the summation of the above result over @xmath4 , and shift @xmath87 in the last two terms ) . more reflection on this issue , shows that the explicit form of the local current operator that enters the kubo formula actually originates from the coupling term @xmath88 term that corresponds to the perturbation of the hamiltonian due to the electric field in a gauge where the scalar potential vanishes ; this is because we evaluate the expectation value of the total current with the perturbation of the hamiltonian due to the external field and that field enters via the vector potential value at a specific plane .",
    "hence the conductivity matrix is defined from the piece of the total current operator that couples to the field at plane @xmath4 and , since the total current will be the sum of the currents at each plane , the current - current correlation function for the conductivity matrix involves the local current operators that couple to the vector potential .",
    "thus , we choose the perturbation of the hamiltonian to be @xmath89 where we have taken the vector potential along the @xmath0-direction , and independent of the intraplane coordinates , because the field is uniform for each plane .",
    "we feel this choice makes good physical sense because we couple the vector potential to the physical current between the @xmath4th and @xmath35st planes .",
    "alternatively , one can view this as a coupling of the current between the @xmath4th and @xmath35st plane to the electric vector potential located halfway between those two planes ( in this interpretation , we would use @xmath90/2 $ ] as the coupling field ) .",
    "finally , one can take a symmetrized version of the local current operator to be @xmath91 corresponding to the average of the currents located just to the left and to the right of plane @xmath4 .",
    "this choice sounds like the most physical choice , but the calculations for it are somewhat more complicated , and it is not likely the end results are too different from our first choice .",
    "the difference between the two choices is actually quite simple . in the first approach",
    ", one should envision the spatial indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 to correspond to @xmath92 and @xmath93 ; that is , they are shifted to the right by half the distance between the planes . in the second , symmetrized approach ,",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath5 indices denote the planar indices . for this reason",
    ", we do nt expect the final results to be too different for either approach . for simplicity ,",
    "we choose to take the current operator to be the current between the @xmath4th and @xmath35st planes for our derivations below , and we discuss how to get the corresponding symmetrized results at the end .    the calculation of the local heat current operator is more complicated .",
    "we adopt the same strategy as before though  first calculate the bulk operator , and then extract a reasonable choice for the local operator . to calculate the bulk heat current operator , we first need to determine the energy polarization operator .",
    "this is similar to the number polarization operator , except it is weighted by the piece of the hamiltonian associated with the @xmath6 position .",
    "this is easy to do for the interaction and hybridization terms , the coulomb potential energy terms , and the band offset terms , which are local , but is complicated for the hopping terms , which involve two lattice sites .",
    "the procedure that is used is to associate half of the hopping term between the two sites with the local hamiltonian at each of those two sites .",
    "the energy polarization term then becomes @xmath94 { \\bf r}_{\\alpha i } , \\label{eq : energy_pol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the hopping piece is divided into two as described above , and the interaction piece includes all the local parts of the interacting hamiltonian associated with each lattice site . the bulk energy current operator is @xmath95 $ ] , and the heat - current operator is @xmath96 because the heat is the energy measured relative to the chemical potential . the commutator is tedious to work out , but just involves straightforward algebra .",
    "when it is finished , we have an expression for the bulk heat current , which can be organized into summations that involve a plane @xmath4 and the plane to the right ( there is also a hopping term involving operators at the @xmath97 plane ) .",

    "we prove that the charge and heat current expectation values vanish in equilibrium when there is an electronic charge reconstruction , in the case where the self - energy is local .",
    "the result should also hold for the nonlocal case , by purely physical reasons , but we are not aware of a simple way to prove this result in the general case .    because the multilayered system is translationally invariant in each plane",
    ", we can use a mixed basis , where we have a two - dimensional momentum describing the planar degrees of freedom , and we use real - space to describe the inhomogeneous @xmath0-direction@xcite . then",

    "the local green s function on each plane is then found by summing over the two - dimensional momenta , which can be replaced by an integral over the two - dimensional density of states : @xmath175 the left function is defined to be @xmath176 and it satisfies the recurrence relation @xmath177 we solve the recurrence relation by starting with the result for @xmath178 , and then iterating eq .",

    "note that this vanishing of the current holds for arbitrary size electronic charge reconstruction , because it does not involve any linear - response assumption .",
    "similarly , since the heat - current operator is related to the number current operator by a derivative with respect to time , and that derivative analytically continues to an extra power of frequency in the integral over frequency , we also have that the heat - current operator expectation value vanishes , because it involves adding an extra power of frequency into the above integrals .",
    "this then completes the proof that the electronic charge reconstruction does not have any currents flowing through it , so the electric fields that enter the linear - response formalism are the external fields only .",
