    "the past few decades witness remarkable progress in the field of spintronics@xcite . based on transport of spin angular momentum , several principles for generation@xcite and detection@xcite of spin current have been clarified or proposed , making building large scale , complex devices approaching reality .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that a spin current does not necessarily have to carry charge . such a charge neutral spin current , or `` pure spin current '' , can be realized in a variety of metallic or insulating systems .",
    "for instance , spin waves in magnetic insulators can also transport angular momentum and be converted into the counterpropagate of conduction electrons with opposite spins@xcite .",
    "the helical edge states in qusntum spin hall states@xcite and topological superconductors@xcite also support pure spin currents that consist of counterpropagate of opposite spins .",
    "another example is the spin supercurrent in magnetic insulators that originates from virtual hopping of electrons , typically proportional to the vector chirality @xmath0 between spins on neighboring sites @xmath1 and @xmath2@xcite , and is shown to be the main mechanism of incommensurate magnetic ordering in multiferroic materials@xcite .",
    "added to the list is the spin josephson effect between two coupled ferromagnetic metals with misaligned magnetizations@xcite , whose josephson current is a pure spin current carried by the magnetic condensate@xcite .    despite the exciting progress in spintronics , one important aspect regarding building practical devices seems to be omitted in the literature , namely the inductance of spintronic devices",
    "one should be reminded that a motive that drives the research in spintronic devices is their advantage over electronic devices , such as lower power consumption . however , as far as inductance is concerned , it is unclear at present if spintronic devices , especially those transport pure spin currents , are still better options compared to electronic devices .    in this article , we clarify the origin of the inductance due to pure spin currents , discussed entirely within the framework of classical electromagnetism .",
    "we noticed that , following the discovery of aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect@xcite , it has been recognized that a time - varying electric ( @xmath3 ) field renders a spin motive force on spin @xmath4 particles , which can be formulated within a @xmath5 gauge theory that treats the spin as gauge charge@xcite . owing to this spin motive force",
    ", we show that when a spin current changes with time , the lorentz boost of the spins creates a time - varying @xmath3 field that in turn exerts a force on the spins , hence the self - inductance . the induction is related to a proposed `` electric flux vector '' calculated by the cross product of the electric field and the particle trajectory .",
    "the relation between spin motive force , inductance , and electric flux vector bears a form similar to faraday s law of induction@xcite .",
    "the analog of lenz s law can be deduced from the energy conservation argument @xcite , which states that the induced emf always opposes changing of the spin current . moreover ,",
    "the electric flux vector is consistent with that defined from quantum interference of magnetic dipoles @xcite .",
    "this correspondence clarifies the fundamental role of the electric flux vector in both quantum mechanics and classical electromagnetism .",
    "we further show that because of the relativistic origin , the inductance due to spin current is practically negligible , hence pure spin currents are indeed better options over electric currents for devices that require low inductance .",
    "on the other hand , in low dimensional systems where the relativistic effect is generally enhanced by several orders of magnitude , the emf due to a time - varying electric field may create small yet detectable pure spin currents .",
    "besides the inductance of spintronic devices , the duality between electricity and magnetism immediately suggests that the inductance of devices that transport electric dipole currents also has the same relativistic origin .",
    "the analog of faraday s law in this case is related to a `` magnetic flux vector '' defined similarly to the electric flux vector .",
    "although there is no sizable point electric dipoles in nature , we show that the same principle also applies to physical dipoles consists of electrons and holes bound by coulomb interaction , as recently realized in semiconductor heterostructures@xcite and bilayer graphene@xcite , as well as dipolar molecules .",
    "a time variance of magnetic flux vector can generate small yet detectable electric dipole currents as long as the system has strong relativistic effect .",
    "to discuss the self - inductance due to dipole currents , we begin by considering the force on a magnetic dipole moving in an @xmath3 field , calculated from the relativistic lagrangian @xcite ( si units are adopted through out the article .",
    "bold face symbols are vectors , except inductance tensor @xmath6 defined later ) @xmath7 the second term comes from the lorentz boost of the magnetic dipole , which yields a electric dipole @xcite @xmath8 that interacts with external electric field in the lab frame ( we only take the leading order in @xmath9 by assuming @xmath10 ) . the force calculated from classical equation of motion is @xmath11 -\\frac{1}{c^{2}}{\\boldsymbol\\mu}\\times\\frac { d{\\bf e } } { d t } \\label{force_general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which recovers the same spin motive force ( to leading order in @xmath3 ) derived rigorously from covariant derivative of the @xmath5 gauge theory for spinful particles@xcite .",
    "another support of this classical formalism is that it derives the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in condensed matter systems where lorentz invariance is generally irrelevant .",
    "either from this classical formalism or the @xmath5 gauge theory , we stress that our point is not to repeat the detail derivation of the spin motive force , but to show that it is intimately related to the inductance due to spin currents .",
    "moreover , eq . ( 2 ) implies that the spin motive force also manifests in spintronic devices which operate at much lower energy scale that lorentz invariance is unimportant .",
    "notice that we express the force in terms of @xmath12 instead of @xmath13 as in most of the literature@xcite , and ignored the effect of magnetic field , both for the sake of discussing inductance .",
    "if the dipole is moving in a closed trajectory , the work done by the force is @xmath14 by assuming a constant @xmath15 . the gradient term in eq .",
    "( [ force_general ] ) drops out after loop integration .",
    "the dc spin current generated by the spin motive force can be described by a drude model .",
    "it is , however , unlikely to create such a dc current over a long period of time , since a constant @xmath16 requires increasing @xmath3 with time indefinitely .",
    "the ac current generated by a homogeneous , time varying @xmath17 is more promising , which yields an ac conductivity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mean free time . despite its similarity to the usual ac conductivity",
    ", an important difference is that drude model is adequate only if the time scale at which @xmath20 varies is much longer than @xmath19 , such that many collision events happen within the time period of the driving force .",
    "this constraints the frequency of the driving force @xmath21 .",
    "we now address self - inductance .",
    "wires carrying a spin current have self - inductance simply because _ the spin current itself produces electric field _ @xcite .",
    "consider the case that changing of electric field @xmath22 is due to changing of the spin current itself @xmath23 .",
    "one can always write @xmath24 which means after integrating @xmath25 along the wire , the result is a quantity that points at the direction @xmath26 and proportional to @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 represents self - inductance tensor that depends on the shape of the wire , and @xmath29 is the unit vector along the direction of @xmath15 .",

    "( [ l_definition ] ) , one obtains a spin motive force @xmath30 this means a changing spin current induces a spin motive force @xmath31 that tends to oppose the change of spin current , which is precisely the meaning of self - inductance .",
    "( [ l_definition ] ) suggests that the flux caused by the spin current itself is a vector @xmath32 and is related to the self - inductance and spin current by @xmath33 , analogous to faraday s law of induction .",
    "compared to previous investigations on spin motive force@xcite that write @xmath34 with @xmath35 , the expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ self_inductance ] ) and ( [ phi_definition ] ) clarify the flux caused by the spin current itself , and the role of inductance that is only determined by the shape of the wire .",
    "we remark that @xmath36 also manifests itself in quantum mechanics , where it characterizes the phase acquired by a magnetic dipole moving in an @xmath3 field @xcite .",
    "running on two parallel trajectories @xmath37 .",
    "( b ) the coaxial cable for comparing inductance @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "( [ self_inductance ] ) acts _ against _ changing of spin current , i.e. , lenz s law , one needs to prove @xmath44 holds for wires of any shape and with any orientation of magnetization @xmath45 . to see this , we introduced two fictitious monopole currents that compose the spin current @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath46 and @xmath47 running on two closed paths , denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , that are of the same shape and lie on parallel planes that are distance @xmath50 apart , as shown in fig .",

    "we conclude that @xmath73 so the work is indeed stored as the energy of the dipolar field @xcite , and @xmath74 , so lenz s law is justified .",

    "[ fig : infinite_wire](b ) . the radii @xmath40 are of the same order .",
    "we compare a charge current @xmath75 running on inner and outer part of the coaxial cable with spin current @xmath76 that has the same particle density @xmath77 and velocity @xmath78 .",
    "this comparison is meaningful in the sense that the two currents transport the same rate of particles , but one carries electron charge whereas the other carries bohr magneton . for the charge current , the work per unit length against the inductance stores in the magnetic field @xmath79 , and inductance per unit length is @xmath80 . for the spin current case the work stores in the electric field",
    "@xmath81 so the spin inductance per unit length @xmath82 depends on the width of the coaxial cable .",
    "the ratio of the two works is @xmath83 for a wire of mm size one obtains @xmath84 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath39 is not surprising because of its relativistic origin .",
    "small inductance implies that to detect a spin current by inductance , as in the design that that uses the charge inductance of a pick up coil to detect the charge supercurrent in an rf superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , is practically not feasible . on the other hand , small inductance also has advantages in practical devices .",
    "for instance , in an @xmath85 circuit , it takes much shorter time to saturate a spin current than a charge current .",
    "evidently , our analysis also implies that if a spintronic device also transports charge , such as those operated with spin - polarized electrons , then its inductance almost entirely comes from the charge current .",
    "previous investigations on spin motive force concern particles that preserve lorentz invariance .",
    "it is , however , intriguing to discuss the feasibility of generating spin current by the spin motive force in solid state devices , derived in eq .",
    "( [ force_general ] ) from classical equation of motion .",
    "there are several options for charge neutral magnetic dipoles , for instance liquid @xmath86he and ferrofluids .",
    "but as far as building practical devices is concerned , spin polarized excitons in semiconductors seem to be more promising@xcite . as sketched in fig . [",
    "fig : infinite_wire](c ) , we proposed that by applying @xmath41 in a semiconducting ring that contains spin polarized excitons generated by polarized light @xcite , the spin current @xmath87 can be realized . to optimize the current , @xmath88 and @xmath89 with @xmath90 should be achieved . as discussed previously , @xmath91 should be longer than @xmath19 such that drude model is adequate , and @xmath57 should be smaller than the field ionization scale which is typically @xmath92v / m for excitons @xcite .",

    "although this velocity seems negligible , it can be dramatically enhanced in systems that have strong rashba soc .",

    "thus we anticipate that a strong rashba soc is necessary to produce a observable spin current via time - varying @xmath3 field .",
    "the changing @xmath3 field also induces a magnetic field @xmath107 .",
    "this is simply the magnetic field due to the oscillating current that pumps the surface charge in and out of the cylinder .",
    "since it is linear to @xmath108 , one can put the semiconducting ring at the bottom of the cylinder(we ignore any complication at the boundary of the cylinder ) to minimize @xmath109 , so its effect on @xmath15 , such as larmor precession or torque , can be ignored , and the assumption of fixed @xmath110 is satisfied .",

    "in summary , starting from the well known spin motive force in the presence of a time - varying @xmath3 field , we show that since a pure spin current itself produces a electric field , the existence of inductance due to spin current is evident .",
