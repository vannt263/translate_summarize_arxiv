    "previous observations of the scale - height in nearby , mostly edge - on , galaxies appeared to find small scale - heights for dust ( e.g , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) but recent observations indicate a much higher scale - height for the dust ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , one that is similar to the stellar scale - height .    in many edge - on galaxies",
    "an h@xmath0 halo can be observed . @xcite and @xcite reported on the kinematics of this h@xmath0 halo for ngc 891 .",
    "its h@xmath0 distribution is extremely asymmetric : the ne side halo is much more extended and brighter ( figure [ f : map ] ) .",
    "is this due to an intrinsic asymmetry in the h@xmath0 emission or an extinction effect ?     the h@xmath0 emission ( false color from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with 24 @xmath1 m contours overlaid , below are the integrated vertical profiles in h@xmath0(blue ) and 24 @xmath1 m ( red dashed line ) , normalized to the top in the ne side . both types of emission are powered by ongoing star - formation .",
    "the 24 @xmath1 m is very symmetrical while the h@xmath0 is not .",
    "figure from @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    in @xcite , we compared two star - formation driven emissions ( h@xmath0 and spitzer 24 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the 24 @xmath1 m is much more symmetric ( figure [ f : map ] ) . assuming both types of emission originate from star - formation regions in the spiral arms of ngc 891 and that the ne arm is closest to us ( figure [ f : mod ] ) , the difference in symmetry between the two types of emission can be attributed to extinction in the inner disk extending out of the plane of the disk ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the inferred scale - height of the out - of - the plane dust ( figure [ f : prof ] ) is similar to the heights to which @xcite report dark structures in ngc 891 .",
    "still this height is much less than the height of dust emission in the halo as reported by m. burgdorf & m. ashby , ( _ this volume _ ) .     a sketch of our model of ngc891 .",

    "the symmetry analysis can be extended to include lower - mass disks and disks with different levels of star - formation .",
    "both are an input into the vertical disk stability model of @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the method are ( 1 ) a measure of the ism s vertical extent right around the inner part of the spiral disks and ( 2 ) the measurement is independent of the stellar distribution , often needed to backlight or heat the dust in other measurements of dust thickness .",
    "an additional benefit is that the method can be applied to a data - set with a widely inhomogeneous data - quality because we compare the left and right symmetries of the images . _",
    "spitzer _ 24 @xmath1 m observations resolve the vertical structure of some galaxies but the resolution is not critical for the method because the _ spitzer _ observations are used to verify the symmetry argument for the h@xmath0 data .",
    "the drawbacks of the method are : ( 1 ) the assumption of a direct spatial relation between the h@xmath0 and 24 @xmath1 m emission .",
    "this may well not hold true in low - level starformation regions or well outside the disk .",
    "and ( 2 ) , the need for a specific spiral arm geometry .",
    "the position of the spiral arms in ngc 891 , is undoubtedly the most favorable .",
    "the method may not work as well if the spiral arms are positioned different than in figure [ f : mod ] or if the spiral pattern is flocculant instead of grand - design .    the physical conditions in spiral disks determine the ism morphology : the turbulence and energy input by star - formation versus the local gravitational pull by the disk s mass in gas and stars .",
    "what are the global conditions in a disk for a dustlane to form ?",
    "symmetry measurements of edge - on spiral disks in wavelengths that are strongly affected by extinction h@xmath0 and those that are not 24 @xmath1m can shed light on the global conditions that prevail in disks when dust lanes form ."
