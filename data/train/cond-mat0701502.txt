    "the ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices have opened a new window to study many - particle quantum physics in a uniquely controlled manner @xcite .",

    "the advances in the manipulation of atom - atom interactions by feshbach resonances @xcite allowed experimental study of many - body systems accessible to the full regime of interactions , even to the very strongly interacting tonks - gas limit @xcite . recently a lot of exciting experiments in optical lattices have been implemented , including the superfluid - mott - insulator transition @xcite , non - linear self - trapping in a periodical optical lattice @xcite and repulsively bound atom pairs in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the basic physics of the ultracold atomic systems in optical lattice is captured by the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite , which incorporates the competition between the interaction and hopping energy and has been successfully applied to interpret the superfluid - mott - insulator transition . as a fundamental model",

    "their experimental results indicate that the atom pairs with strongly repulsive on - site interaction @xmath0 exhibits a remarkably longer lifetime than the system with weakly repulsive interaction @xcite . at first glance , this result is counter - intuition because one may expect the repulsive interaction to separate the particles , instead to bind them together . the experimental result has stimulated theoretical investigations on the dynamics of repulsively bound pairs @xcite . in ref.@xcite , the theoretical understanding of the stable pair relies on the analytical solution of a two - particle problem by solving two particle lippmann - schwinger scattering equation on the lattice corresponding to the bose - hubbard hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "obviously , this method is only limited to a single repulsively bound pair and is not capable to extend to deal with many - particle dynamic problem .    motivated by the experimental progress @xcite , in this paper we study the quantum dynamics of the repulsively pair states in the bhm both analytically and numerically . in the strongly repulsive limit",
    ", we develop an analytical method to deal with the dynamical problem based on the perturbation expansion of the hopping terms , whereas we can numerically solve the dynamic problem in the whole regime of interaction for a finite - size system which could be diagonalized exactly by the exact diagonalization method .",

    "the bose - hubbard model has been investigated by a variety of theoretical and numerical methods under different cases @xcite .",
