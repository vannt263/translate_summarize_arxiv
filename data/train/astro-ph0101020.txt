    "it is now widely accepted that acceleration in supernova - driven shock waves plays an important role in the production of the observed cosmic ray spectrum up to energies of @xmath0ev ( heavens 1984a ; ko 1995a ) , and it is plausible that acceleration in shocks near stellar - size compact objects can produce most of the cosmic radiation observed at higher energies ( jones & ellison 1991 ) . in the generic shock acceleration model , cosmic rays scatter elastically with magnetic irregularities ( mhd waves ) that are frozen into the background ( thermal ) gas ( gleeson & axford 1967 ; skilling 1975 ) . in crossing the shock , these waves experience the same compression and deceleration as the background gas , if the speed of the waves with respect to the gas ( roughly the alfvn speed ) is negligible compared with the flow velocity ( achterberg 1987 ) .",
    "the convergence of the scattering centers in the shock creates a situation where the cosmic rays gain energy systematically each time they cross the shock .",
    "since the cosmic rays are able to diffuse spatially , they can cross the shock many times . in this process , an exponentially small fraction of the cosmic rays experience an exponentially large increase in their momentum due to repeated shock crossings .",
    "the characteristic spectrum resulting from this first - order fermi process is a power - law in momentum ( krymskii 1977 ; bell 1978a , b ; blandford & ostriker 1978 ) .",
    "it was recognized early on that if the cosmic rays in the downstream region carry away a significant fraction of the momentum flux supplied by the incident ( upstream ) gas , then the dynamical effect of the cosmic - ray pressure must be included in order to obtain an accurate description of the shock structure ( axford , leer , & skadron 1977 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the coupled nonlinear problem of the gas dynamics and the energization of the cosmic rays must be treated in a self - consistent manner .",
    "a great deal of attention has been focused on the `` two - fluid '' model for diffusive shock acceleration as a possible description for the self - consistent cosmic - ray modified shock problem . in this steady - state theory ,",
    "first analyzed in detail by drury & vlk ( 1981 , hereafter dv ) , the cosmic rays and the background gas are modeled as interacting fluids with constant specific heat ratios @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . the coupling between the cosmic rays and the gas is provided by mhd waves , which serve as scattering centers but are otherwise ignored .",
    "the cosmic rays are treated as massless particles , and second - order fermi acceleration due to the stochastic wave propagation is ignored . within the context of the two - fluid model ,",
    "dv were able to demonstrate the existence of multiple ( up to 3 ) distinct dynamical solutions for certain upstream boundary conditions .",
    "the solutions include flows that are smooth everywhere as well as flows that contain discontinuous , gas - mediated `` subshocks . ''",
    "subsequently , multiple solutions have also been obtained in modified two - fluid models that incorporate a source term representing the injection of seed cosmic rays ( ko , chan , & webb 1997 ; zank , webb , & donohue 1993 ) .",
    "only one solution can be realized in a given flow , but without incorporating additional physics one can not determine which solution it will be .",
    "the two - fluid model has been extended to incorporate a quantitative treatment of the mhd wave field by mckenzie & vlk ( 1982 ) and vlk , drury , & mckenzie ( 1984 ) using a `` three - fluid '' approach .    during the intervening decades ,",
    "a great deal of effort has been expended on analyzing the structure and the stability of cosmic - ray modified shocks ( see jones & ellison 1991 and ko 1995b for reviews ) .",
    "much of this work has focused on the time - dependent behavior of the two - fluid model , which is known to be unstable to the development of acoustic waves ( drury & falle 1986 ; kang , jones , & ryu 1992 ) and magnetosonic waves ( zank , axford , & mckenzie 1990 ) .",
    "ryu , kang , & jones ( 1993 ) extended the analysis of acoustic modes to include a secondary , rayleigh - taylor instability . in most cases",
    ", it is found that the cosmic - ray pressure distribution is not substantially modified by the instabilities .",
    "the two - fluid theory of dv suffers from a `` closure problem '' in the sense that there is not enough information to compute the adiabatic indices @xmath2 and @xmath1 self - consistently , and therefore they must be treated as free parameters ( achterberg , blandford , & periwal 1984 ; duffy , drury , & vlk 1994 ) .",
    "this has motivated the subsequent development of more complex theories that utilize a diffusion - convection transport equation to solve for the cosmic - ray momentum distribution along with the flow structure self - consistently . in these models , `` seed '' cosmic rays are either advected into the shock region from far upstream , or injected into the gas within the shock itself .",
    "interestingly , kang & jones ( 1990 ) , achterberg , blandford , & periwal ( 1984 ) , and malkov ( 1997a ; 1997b ) found that diffusion - convection theories can also yield multiple dynamical solutions for certain values of the upstream parameters , in general agreement with the two - fluid model .",
    "frank , jones , & ryu ( 1995 ) have obtained numerical solutions to the time - dependent diffusion - convection equation for oblique cosmic - ray modified shocks that are in agreement with the predictions of the steady - state two - fluid model .",
    "these studies suggest that , despite its shortcomings , the two - fluid theory remains one of the most useful tools available for analyzing the acceleration of cosmic rays in shocks waves ( ko 1995b ) .    in their approach to modeling the diffusive acceleration of cosmic rays",
    ", dv stated the upstream boundary conditions for the incident flow in terms of the total mach number , @xmath3 and the ratio of the cosmic - ray pressure to the total pressure , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denote the flow velocity of the background gas , the total sound speed , the gas density , and the total , cosmic - ray , and gas pressures , respectively .",
    "we will use the subscripts `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' to denote quantities associated with the far upstream and downstream regions , respectively .",
    "dv described the incident flow conditions by selecting values for @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "once these parameters have been specified , the determination of the flow structure ( and in particular the number of possible solutions ) in the simplest form of the two - fluid model requires several stages of root finding . since the analysis is inherently numerical in nature , the results are usually stated only for specific upstream conditions .",
    "the characterization of the upstream conditions in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 employed by dv turns out to be an inconvenient choice from the point of view of finding exact critical relations describing the number of possible flow solutions for given upstream conditions . as an alternative approach , it is possible to work in terms of the individual gas and cosmic - ray mach numbers , defined respectively by @xmath13 where @xmath14 denote the gas and cosmic - ray sound speeds , respectively . according to equation  ( 1.1 ) , @xmath15 , and",
    "therefore the mach numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 are related to the total mach number @xmath18 and the pressure ratio @xmath19 via @xmath20 or , equivalently , @xmath21 since these equations apply everywhere in the flow , the boundary conditions in the two - fluid model can evidently be expressed by selecting values for _ any two _ of the four upstream parameters @xmath22 . in their work ,",
    "dv described the upstream conditions using @xmath23 , whereas ko , chan , & webb ( 1997 ) and axford , leer , & mckenzie ( 1982 ) used @xmath24 .",
    "another alternative , which apparently has not been considered before , is to use the parameters @xmath25 .",
    "although these choices are all equivalent from a physical point of view , we demonstrate below that the set @xmath25 is the most advantageous mathematically because it allows us to derive _ exact _ constraint curves that clearly delineate the regions of various possible behavior in the parameter space of the two - fluid model .",
    "this approach exploits the formal symmetry between the cosmic - ray quantities and the gas quantities as they appear in the expressions describing the asymptotic states of the flow .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in   2",
    "we discuss the transport equation for the cosmic rays and derive the associated moment equation for the variation of the cosmic - ray energy density . in   3 we employ momentum and energy conservation to obtain an exact result for the critical upstream cosmic - ray mach number that determines whether smooth flow is possible for a given value of the upstream gas mach number . in ",
    "4 we derive exact critical conditions for the existence of multiple solutions containing a discontinuous , gas - mediated subshock .",
    "the resulting curves are plotted and analyzed for various values of the adiabatic indices @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in   5 we present specific examples of multiple - solution flows that verify the predictions made using our analytical critical conditions .",
    "we conclude in   6 with a general discussion of our results and their significance for the theory of diffusive cosmic - ray acceleration .",
    "the two - fluid model is developed by treating the cosmic rays as a fluid with energy density comparable to that of the background gas , but possessing negligible mass . in this section",
    "we review the basic equations relevant for the two - fluid model . for integrity and clarity of presentation",
    ", we also include re - derivations of a few of the published results concerning the overall shock structure and the nature of the transonic flow .      the diffusive acceleration of energetic cosmic rays due to the convergence of scattering centers in a one - dimensional , plane - parallel flow is described by the transport equation ( skilling 1971 ; 1975 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the particle momentum , @xmath28 is the flow velocity of the background gas ( taken to be positive in the direction of increasing @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , and the operator @xmath31 expresses the comoving ( lagrangian ) time derivative in the frame of the gas .",
    "equation  ( 2.1 ) describes the effects of fermi acceleration , bulk advection , and spatial diffusion on the direction - integrated ( isotropic ) cosmic - ray momentum distribution @xmath32 , which is normalized so that the total number density of the cosmic rays is given by @xmath33 note that equation  ( 2.1 ) neglects the second - order fermi acceleration of the cosmic rays that occurs due to stochastic wave propagation , which is valid provided the alfvn speed @xmath34 is much less than the flow velocity @xmath5 , where @xmath35 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "furthermore , equation  ( 2.1 ) does not include a particle collision term , and therefore it is not applicable to the background gas , which is assumed to have a thermal distribution .",
    "the momentum , mass , and energy conservation equations for the gas can be written in the comoving frame as @xmath36 respectively , where @xmath37 is the internal energy density of the gas . the expression for @xmath38 in equation  ( 2.4 ) implies a purely adiabatic variation of @xmath39 , and therefore it neglects any heating or cooling of the gas due to wave generation or damping .",
    "this adiabatic equation must be replaced with the appropriate rankine - hugoniot jump conditions at a discontinuous , gas - mediated subshock , should one occur in the flow . in the case of a relativistic subshock , the momentum conservation equation for the gas must be modified to reflect the anisotropy of the pressure distribution ( e.g. , kirk & webb 1988 ) .      the pressure @xmath9 and the energy density @xmath40 associated with the isotropic cosmic - ray momentum distribution @xmath41 are given by ( duffy , drury , & vlk 1994 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 denote respectively the kinetic energy , the speed , and the lorentz factor of a cosmic ray with momentum @xmath27 and mass @xmath44 .",
    "although the lower bound of integration is formally taken to be @xmath45 , in practice the cosmic rays are highly relativistic particles , and therefore @xmath41 vanishes for @xmath46 .",
    "if the distribution has the power - law form @xmath47 , then we must have @xmath48 in order to avoid divergence in the integrals for @xmath9 and @xmath40 ( achterberg , blandford , & periwal 1984 ) , although this restriction can be lifted if cutoffs are imposed at high and/or low momentum ( kang & jones 1990 ) .",
    "we can obtain a conservation equation for the cosmic - ray energy density @xmath40 by operating on the transport equation  ( 2.1 ) with @xmath49 , yielding @xmath50 where the mean diffusion coefficient @xmath51 is defined by ( duffy , drury , & vlk 1994 ) @xmath52 and the cosmic - ray adiabatic index @xmath1 is defined by ( malkov & vlk 1996 ) @xmath53 note that in deriving equation  ( 2.7 ) , we have dropped an extra term that arises via integration by parts because it must vanish in order to obtain finite values for @xmath9 and @xmath40 . the integral expression in equation  ( 2.9 )",
    "indicates that @xmath1 must lie in the range @xmath54 .",
    "it also demonstrates that @xmath1 will evolve in response to changes in the shape of the momentum distribution @xmath41 .",
    "the closure problem in the two - fluid model arises because @xmath41 is not calculated at all , and therefore @xmath1 must be imposed rather than computed self - consistently .",
    "the conservation equations can be rewritten in standard eulerian form as @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 where the fluxes of mass , momentum , and total energy are given respectively by @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 the momentum and energy fluxes can be expressed in dimensionless form as @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the asymptotic upstream flow velocity and the dimensionless quantities @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are defined respectively by @xmath67 note that the definition of @xmath64 implies that the incident flow has @xmath68 .",
    "these relations can be used to rewrite equations  ( 1.3 ) for the gas and cosmic - ray mach numbers as @xmath69      in this paper we shall adopt the two - fluid approximation in the form used by dv , and therefore we assume that the adiabatic indices @xmath2 and @xmath1 are each constant throughout the flow .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath2 is probably reasonable since the background gas is expected to remain thermal and nonrelativistic at all locations .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath1 is more problematic , since we expect the cosmic ray distribution to evolve throughout the flow in response to fermi acceleration , but it is justifiable if the `` seed '' cosmic rays are already relativistic in the far upstream region .",
    "we also assume that a steady state prevails , so that the fluxes @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are all conserved . in this case",
    "the quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 express the pressures of the two species relative to the upstream ram pressure of the gas @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the asymptotic upstream mass density .",
    "the eulerian frame in which we are working is necessarily the frame of the shock , since that is the only frame in which the flow can appear stationary ( becker 1998 ) . in a steady state ,",
    "the adiabatic variation of @xmath65 implied by equation  ( 2.4 ) indicates that along any smooth section of the flow , the gas pressure can be calculated in terms of the velocity using @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote fiducial quantities measured at an arbitrary , fixed location within the section of interest . according to equation  ( 2.19 ) , the associated variation of the gas mach number along the smooth section of the flow",
    "is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the gas mach number at the fiducial location .",
    "substituting for @xmath65 in equation  ( 2.16 ) using equation  ( 2.20 ) and differentiating the result with respect to @xmath29 yields the dynamical equation ( achterberg 1987 ; ko , chan , & webb 1997 ) @xmath80 critical points occur where the numerator and denominator vanish simultaneously .",
    "the vanishing of the denominator implies that @xmath81 at the critical point , and therefore the critical point is also a _ gas sonic point _",
    "( axford , leer , & mckenzie 1982 ) .",
    "the vanishing of the numerator implies that @xmath82 at the gas sonic point .",
    "we can rewrite the dimensionless momentum flux @xmath83 by using equations  ( 2.19 ) to substitute for @xmath65 and @xmath66 in equation  ( 2.16 ) , yielding @xmath84 similarly , equation  ( 2.17 ) for the dimensionless energy flux @xmath85 becomes @xmath86 using equation  ( 2.23 ) to eliminate @xmath17 in equation  ( 2.24 ) yields for the gradient of the cosmic - ray pressure @xmath87 where @xmath88 along any smooth section of the flow , @xmath89 depends only on @xmath64 by virtue of equation  ( 2.21 ) , which gives @xmath16 as a function of @xmath64 . in the two - fluid model , the flow is assumed to become gradient - free asymptotically , so that @xmath90 in the far upstream and downstream regions ( dv ; ko , chan , & webb 1997 ) .",
    "the function @xmath89 must therefore vanish as @xmath91 , and consequently we can express the values of @xmath83 and @xmath85 in terms of the upstream mach numbers @xmath92 and @xmath93 using @xmath94 and @xmath95 where we have also employed the boundary condition @xmath96 .",
    "the critical nature of the dynamical equation  ( 2.22 ) implies that @xmath97 at the gas sonic point .",
    "hence if the flow is to pass _ smoothly _ through a gas sonic point , then @xmath89 must vanish at _ three _ locations .",
    "it follows that one of the key questions concerning the flow structure is the determination of the number of points at which @xmath97 .",
    "we can address this question by differentiating equation  ( 2.25 ) with respect to @xmath64 , which yields @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the total mach number , and we have used the result @xmath100 implied by equation  ( 2.21 ) . for the second derivative of @xmath89",
    "we obtain @xmath101 since the cosmic rays have a higher average lorentz factor than the thermal background gas , @xmath102 ( cf .",
    "2.9 ) , and therefore @xmath103 , implying that @xmath104 is concave down as indicated in figure  1 .",
    "hence there are exactly _ two _ roots for @xmath64 that yield @xmath97 , one given by the upstream velocity @xmath105 and the other given by the downstream velocity , denoted by @xmath106 .",
    "we therefore conclude that if the flow includes a gas sonic point , then the velocity at that point must be either @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "consequently the flow can not pass smoothly through a gas sonic point , as first pointed out by dv .",
    "the flows envisioned here are decelerating , and therefore the high - velocity root @xmath109 is associated with the incident flow . in this case , the fact that @xmath104 is concave - down implies that @xmath110 in the upstream region , and therefore based on equation  ( 2.29 ) we conclude that @xmath111 in the upstream region and @xmath112 in the downstream region , with @xmath113 at the peak of the curve where @xmath114 . hence the flow _ must _ contain a sonic transition with respect to the _ total _ sound speed @xmath6 . in this sense ,",
    "the flow is a `` shock '' whether or not it contains an actual discontinuity .",
    "for the flow to decelerate through a shock transition , the total upstream mach number must therefore satisfy the condition @xmath115 .",
    "this constraint also implies that the upstream flow must be supersonic with respect to both the gas and cosmic - ray sound speeds ( i.e. , @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) , since @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , for a given value of @xmath92 , the upstream cosmic - ray mach number @xmath93 must exceed the minimum value @xmath119 corresponding to the limit @xmath120 . the requirement that @xmath116 forces us to conclude that if a gas sonic point exists in the flow , then it must be identical to the gradient - free asymptotic _ downstream",
    "consequently the flow must either remain supersonic everywhere with respect to the gas , or it must cross a discontinuous , gas - mediated subshock . if @xmath121 everywhere , then the flow is completely smooth and the gas sonic point is `` virtual , '' meaning that it exists in the parameter space , but it does not lie along the flow trajectory . in this case , the gas pressure evolves in a purely adiabatic fashion according to equation  ( 2.20 ) , although the total entropy of the combined system ( gas plus cosmic rays ) must increase as the flow crosses the shock , despite the fact that it is smooth . in ",
    "3 we derive the critical value for the upstream cosmic - ray mach number @xmath93 that determines whether or not smooth flow is possible for a given value of the upstream gas mach number @xmath92 .",
    "the overall structure of a cosmic - ray modified shock governed by the dynamical equation  ( 2.22 ) can display a variety of qualitatively different behaviors , as first pointed out by dv .",
    "depending on the upstream parameters , up to three distinct steady - state solutions are possible , although only one of these can be realized in a given situation .",
    "the possibilities include globally smooth solutions as well as solutions containing a discontinuous , gas - mediated subshock .",
    "smooth flow is expected when the upstream cosmic - ray pressure @xmath122 is sufficiently large since in this case cosmic ray diffusion is able to smooth out the discontinuity . in this section",
    "we utilize the critical nature of the dynamical equation to derive an analytic expression for the critical condition that determines when smooth flow is possible , as a function of the upstream ( incident ) mach numbers @xmath93 and @xmath92 .      whether or not the flow contains a discontinuous , gas - mediated subshock",
    ", it must be smooth in the upstream region ( preceding the subshock if one exists ) .",
    "we can therefore apply equation ( 2.21 ) for the variation of @xmath16 in the upstream region , where it is convenient to use the incident parameters @xmath68 and @xmath92 as the fiducial quantities .",
    "the requirement that @xmath123 at the gas sonic point implies that the velocity there is given by @xmath124 which we refer to as the `` critical velocity . ''",
    "if a sonic point exists in the flow , then @xmath125 must correspond to the downstream root of the equation @xmath126 , i.e. , @xmath127 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath125 depends only on @xmath92 , and consequently it is independent of @xmath93 .",
    "the asymptotic states of the flow are assumed to be gradient - free , and the critical conditions associated with the dynamical equation  ( 2.22 ) imply that @xmath128 at the gas sonic point .",
    "the constancy of @xmath85 and @xmath83 therefore allows us to link upstream quantities to quantities at the gas sonic point by using equations  ( 2.23 ) , ( 2.24 ) , ( 2.27 ) , and ( 2.28 ) to write @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively , where @xmath131 denotes the value of the cosmic - ray mach number at the gas sonic point .",
    "if we substitute for @xmath125 using equation  ( 3.1 ) and eliminate @xmath131 by combining equations  ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) , we can solve for @xmath93 to obtain an _ exact expression _ for the critical upstream cosmic - ray mach number required for the existence of a sonic point in the asymptotic downstream region , @xmath132 \\gamma_c - \\left[\\left({r_0 ^ 2 \\over 2 } - { 1 \\over 2 } - { 1 \\over \\gamma_g-1 } \\right ) m_{g0}^2 + { r_0 ^ 2 \\over \\gamma_g - 1 } \\right ] \\left(\\gamma_c - 1 \\right ) \\over r_0 \\ , ( r_0 - 1 ) \\ , m_{g0}^2 } \\right\\}^{-1/2 } \\ , , \\eqno(3.4)\\ ] ] where @xmath133 note that @xmath134 is an explicit function of the upstream gas mach number @xmath92 .",
    "the interpretation is that if @xmath135 for a given value of @xmath92 , then the flow is everywhere supersonic with respect to the gas sound speed @xmath136 except in the far - downstream region , where it asymptotically approaches the gas sonic point .",
    "surprisingly , this simple solution for @xmath134 has apparently never before appeared in the literature , probably due to the fact that the analytical form is lost when one works in terms of the alternative parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 employed by dv .",
    "this can be clearly demonstrated by using the expressions @xmath137 to substitute for @xmath92 and @xmath93 in equations  ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) and then attempting to solve the resulting equation for either @xmath12 or @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that it is not possible to express either of these quantities explicitly in terms of the other . in figure  2",
    "we depict the curve @xmath135 in the @xmath25 parameter space using equations  ( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) for various values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "we have determined that smooth flow into an asymptotic downstream gas sonic point is possible if @xmath135 .",
    "however , in order to obtain a complete understanding of the significance of the critical upstream cosmic - ray mach number @xmath134 , we must determine the nature of the flow when @xmath138 .",
    "the resulting flow structure can be analyzed by perturbing around the state @xmath135 by taking the derivative of the asymptotic downstream velocity @xmath108 with respect to @xmath93 , holding @xmath92 constant .",
    "the fact that @xmath92 is held fixed implies that the critical velocity @xmath125 also remains unchanged by virtue of equation  ( 3.1 ) . upon differentiating ,",
    "we obtain @xmath139^{-1 } \\ , , \\eqno(3.7)\\ ] ] which is always negative since the flow decelerates , and therefore @xmath140 .",
    "this indicates that if @xmath93 is _ decreased _ from the value @xmath141 for fixed @xmath92 , then the downstream velocity @xmath108 _ increases _ above the critical velocity @xmath125 , and therefore the flow is everywhere supersonic with respect to the gas sound speed . in this case",
    "there is no gas sonic point in the flow , and consequently a globally smooth solution is possible .",
    "conversely , when @xmath142 , a gas sonic point exists in the flow , and therefore the flow can not be globally smooth because that would require smooth passage through a gas sonic point , which we have proven to be impossible . in this case",
    ", the flow _ must _ pass through a discontinuous , gas - mediated subshock .",
    "we conclude that globally smooth flow is possible in the region below each of the critical curves plotted in figure  2 .",
    "note that in each case there is a critical value for @xmath92 , denoted by @xmath143 , to the right of which smooth flow is _ always _",
    "possible for _ any _ value of @xmath93 .",

    "we plot @xmath143 as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath1 in figure  3 .",
    "when @xmath147 and @xmath148 , we find that @xmath149 , in agreement with the numerical results of dv and heavens ( 1984b ) .",
    "dv discovered that two new discontinuous solutions become available in addition to either a smooth solution or another discontinuous solution when the upstream total mach number @xmath11 is sufficiently large .",
    "subsequent authors have confirmed the existence of multiple dynamical solutions within the context of the two - fluid model ( achterberg , blandford , & periwal 1984 ; axford , leer , & mckenzie 1982 ; kang & jones 1990 ; ko , chan , & webb 1997 ; zank , webb , & donohue 1993 ) .",
    "however , most of this work utilized numerical root - finding procedures and therefore it fails to provide much insight into the structure of the critical conditions that determine when multiple solutions are possible .",
    "we revisit the problem in this section by recasting the upstream boundary conditions using the same approach employed in   3 .",
    "in particular , we show that when the incident flow conditions are stated in terms of the upstream gas and cosmic - ray mach numbers @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , it is possible to obtain exact , analytical formulae for the critical curves that form the border of the region of multiple solutions in the parameter space .      the existence of multiple dynamical solutions is connected with the presence in the flow of a discontinuous subshock mediated by the pressure of the gas .",
    "we can therefore derive critical criteria related to the multiple - solution phenomenon by focusing on the nature of the flow in the post - subshock region , assuming that a subshock exists in the flow .",
    "as we demonstrate in the appendix , the energy , momentum , and particle fluxes for the cosmic rays and the background gas are independently conserved as the flow crosses the subshock .",
    "this implies that the quantities associated with the gas satisfy the usual rankine - hugoniot jump conditions , as pointed out by dv .",
    "far downstream from the subshock , the flow must certainly relax into a gradient - free condition if a steady state prevails .",
    "in fact , it is possible to demonstrate that the entire post - subshock region is gradient - free , so that @xmath150constant downstream from the subshock .",
    "this has already been shown by dv using a geometrical approach , but it can also be easily established using the following simple mathematical argument . first we combine the dynamical equation  ( 2.22 ) with the definition of @xmath104 given by equation  ( 2.25 ) to obtain the alternative form @xmath151 in the post - subshock gas , @xmath152 and therefore @xmath112 regardless of the value of @xmath17 , since @xmath153 .",

    "if the flow is to be stationary , then @xmath64 must jump _ directly _ to the value @xmath108 , and the entire post - subshock region must therefore be gradient - free .",
    "this conclusion is valid within the context of the `` standard '' two - fluid model studied by dv , but zank , webb , & donohue ( 1993 ) suggest that it may be violated in models including injection .",
    "we can derive an expression for @xmath104 suitable for use in the post - subshock region by employing equation  ( 2.21 ) to eliminate @xmath16 in equation  ( 2.25 ) .",
    "this yields @xmath162 where we have adopted the immediate post - subshock values @xmath163 and @xmath164 as the fiducial quantities in the smooth section of the flow downstream from the subshock .",

    "fortunately , additional information is also available that can be utilized to calculate the shape of the critical curve in @xmath25 space bordering the region of multiple subshock solutions .",
    "the nature of this information becomes clear when one examines the topology of the function @xmath176 as depicted in figures  5 and 6 for @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we consider a sequence of situations with @xmath92 held fixed and @xmath93 gradually increasing from the minimum value @xmath179 given by equation  ( 2.32 ) , corresponding to the limit @xmath120 .",
    "note that since @xmath92 is held constant , the critical velocity @xmath125 also remains constant according to equation  ( 3.1 ) .",
    "two qualitatively different behaviors are observed depending on whether or not @xmath92 exceeds @xmath143 , where @xmath180 is the critical upstream gas mach number for smooth flow calculated using equation  ( 3.8 ) with @xmath177 and @xmath178 .    in figure  5_a",

    "note that initially , for small @xmath93 , there is one root for @xmath168 corresponding to the single crossing of the line @xmath175 .",
    "since this root does not exceed @xmath125 , a subshock solution is impossible and instead the flow must be globally smooth as discussed in   3 .",
    "the choice @xmath182 satisfies the condition @xmath185 , and therefore as @xmath93 increases , the root for @xmath168 eventually equals @xmath125 , which occurs when @xmath186 . in this case",
    "the subshock is located at the asymptotic downstream limit of the flow , and therefore it is identical to the gas sonic point .",
    "equations  ( 3.1 ) and ( 4.6 ) indicate that the pre - subshock gas mach number @xmath187 as expected .    as we continue to increase @xmath93 beyond the critical value @xmath134 in figure  5_a _ , the root for @xmath168",
    "exceeds @xmath125 , and therefore the smooth solution is replaced by a subshock solution .",
    "we refer to this solution as the `` primary '' subshock solution .",
    "since @xmath188 in this region of the parameter space , the subshock plays a significant role in modifying the flow . if @xmath93 is increased further , the primary root for @xmath168 increases slowly , the concave - down shape changes , and a new peak begins to emerge at large @xmath168 .",

    "the development of this new root can be clearly seen in figure  5_b _ , where we replot @xmath181 at a much smaller scale .",
    "as @xmath93 continues to increase , the peak continues to rise , and the new @xmath168 root bifurcates into two roots . since the two new roots for @xmath168 are larger than the primary root , the corresponding pre - subshock gas mach numbers are also larger , and therefore the two new subshocks are stronger than the primary subshock .",
    "we conclude that in this region of the @xmath25 parameter space , _ three _ discontinuous subshock solutions are possible , although only one can occur in a given situation .",

    "hence the `` primary '' subshock solution never appears in this example .",
    "however , for sufficiently large @xmath93 , a peak develops in @xmath181 just as in figure  5_b_. this peak rises with increasing @xmath93 and eventually crosses the line @xmath195 at @xmath196 when @xmath197 , corresponding to the appearance of a new physically acceptable subshock root for @xmath168 .",
    "this new root bifurcates into two roots as @xmath93 is increased , which can be clearly seen in figure  6_b _ , where @xmath181 is replotted on a much smaller scale .",
    "it follows that in this region of @xmath25 space , two discontinuous solutions are possible in addition to a single globally smooth solution .",
    "it is apparent from figures  5 and 6 that the onset of multiple solutions is connected with the vanishing of @xmath181 coupled with the additional , simultaneous condition @xmath198 which supplements equation  ( 4.7 ) .",

    "once @xmath199 is determined , we can calculate the corresponding critical upstream cosmic - ray mach number @xmath200 using either equation  ( 4.10 ) or equation  ( 4.11 ) , which both yield the same result .",

    "while admittedly somewhat complex , these equations can nonetheless be evaluated using a hand calculator , and replace the requirement of utilizing the root - finding techniques employed in most previous investigations of the multiple - solution phenomenon in the two - fluid model .",
    "in figure  7 we plot the critical curves for the occurrence of multiple solutions using various values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is accomplished by evaluating @xmath199 and @xmath200 as parametric functions of the pre - subshock velocity @xmath168 using equation  ( 4.12 ) along with either equation  ( 4.10 ) or ( 4.11 ) .",

    "this is the most fully self - consistent example of the two - fluid model , since in this case we expect that the adiabatic indices will remain constant throughout the flow , as is assumed in the model ( see eq .",

    "the existence of domain  iv is consistent with our expectation that smooth flow will occur for sufficiently large values of the upstream cosmic - ray pressure @xmath122 due to diffusion of the cosmic rays .",
    "if we consider a trajectory through the @xmath25 parameter space that crosses into the multiple - solution region , then the sequence of appearance of the subshock roots for @xmath168 depends on whether the boundary is crossed through the `` top '' or `` bottom '' arcs of the wedge .",

    "note that the primary subshock root for @xmath168 already exists at points @xmath19 and @xmath229 since they both lie inside domain  i. when the lower section of the multiple - solution boundary is crossed along segment @xmath230 ( @xmath234 in fig .",

    "the first three quantities exhibit a jump at the subshock , whereas the cosmic - ray pressure is continuous since a jump in this quantity would imply an infinite energy flux .",

    "we therefore expect to find three distinct , physically acceptable subshock solutions associated with these parameter values .",

    "in the globally smooth solution , which is cosmic - ray dominated , the pressures increase by the factors @xmath277 and @xmath278 , and the compression ratio is @xmath279 . in this case",

[ 1.1 ] and [ 1.2 ] ) . in this approach",
    "the determination of the available solution types requires several steps of root - finding , and there is no possibility of obtaining analytical expressions for the critical relationships .",

    "these expressions eliminate the need for complex root - finding procedures in order to understand the possible flow dynamics for a given set of upstream boundary conditions , and are made possible by the symmetry between the gas and cosmic - ray parameters as they appear in the expressions describing the asymptotic upstream and downstream states of the flow .",
    "we have compared our quantitative results with those of ko , chan , & webb ( 1997 ) and bulanov & sokolov ( 1984 ) , and they are found to be consistent .",
    "the results are valid for arbitrary ( but constant ) values of the gas and cosmic - ray adiabatic indices @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively . in   5",
    "we have presented numerical examples of flow structures obtained in each of the four parameter space domains defined in figure  8 .",
    "these examples verify the predictions made using our new expressions for the critical mach numbers , and confirm that the largest overall compression ratios are obtained in the globally - smooth , cosmic - ray dominated cases .",
    "the existence of multiple distinct solutions for a single set of upstream boundary conditions demands that we include additional physics in order to determine which solution is actually realized in a given situation .",
    "this question has been addressed by numerous authors using various forms of stability analysis as well as fully time - dependent calculations .",
    "dv speculated that when three distinct solutions are allowed ( in domains ii and iii of the parameter space plotted in fig .",
    "8) , the solution with the intermediate value of the cosmic - ray pressure @xmath66 will be unstable .",
    "the argument is based on the idea that if the cosmic - ray pressure were to increase slightly due to a small perturbation , then the gas would suffer additional deceleration , leading to a further increase in the cosmic - ray pressure .",
    "this nonlinear process would drive the flow towards the steady - state solution with the largest value of @xmath66 .",
    "conversely , a small decrease in the cosmic - ray pressure would decrease the deceleration , leading to a smaller value for the cosmic - ray pressure . in this case",
    "the flow would be driven towards the steady - state solution with the smallest value of @xmath66 .",
    "recently , mond & drury ( 1998 ) have suggested that this type of behavior may be realized as a consequence of a corrugational instability .",
    "other authors ( e.g. , drury & falle 1986 ; kang , jones , & ryu 1992 ; zank , axford , & mckenzie 1990 ; ryu , kang , & jones 1993 ) have argued that the globally smooth , cosmic - ray dominated solutions are unstable to the evolution of mhd waves in certain situations .",
    "jones & ellison ( 1991 ) suggest that even when formally stable , the smooth solutions may not be realizable in nature . on the other hand , donohue , zank , & webb ( 1994 ) report time - dependent simulations which seem to indicate that the smooth",
    ", cosmic - ray dominated solution is indeed the preferred steady - state solution in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "hence , despite the fact that much effort has been expended in analyzing the stability properties of cosmic - ray modified shocks , there is still no clear consensus regarding which of the steady - state solutions ( if any ) is stable and therefore physically observable for an arbitrary set of upstream conditions .    in light of the rather contradictory state of affairs regarding the stability properties of the various possible dynamical solutions , we propose a new form of _ entropy - based _ stability analysis . in this method ,",
    "the entropy of the cosmic - ray distribution is calculated by first solving the transport equation  ( 2.1 ) for the cosmic - ray distribution @xmath41 and then integrating to obtain the boltzmann entropy per cosmic ray , @xmath287 where @xmath288 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath289 is the cosmic - ray number density , @xmath290 is planck s constant , @xmath291 is the system volume , and @xmath292 . according to equation  ( 2.3 ) , @xmath293 gives the probability that a randomly selected cosmic ray at location @xmath29 has momentum in the range between @xmath27 and @xmath294 .",
    "the cosmic - ray entropy density @xmath295 is computed using @xmath296 where the final two terms stem from the fundamental indistinguishability of the cosmic ray particles ( of like composition ) , and is necessary in order to avoid the gibbs paradox ( reif 1965 ) . the inconvenient reference to the system volume @xmath291",
    "can be removed by combining equations  ( 6.1 ) and ( 6.2 ) to obtain the equivalent expression @xmath297 the total entropy per particle @xmath298 for the combined gas - particle system is calculated using @xmath299 where @xmath300 and @xmath301 denote the entropy density and the number density of the background gas , respectively .",
    "one may reasonably hypothesize that the state with the largest value for @xmath298 will be the preferred state in nature .",
    "this criterion may prove useful for identifying the most stable solution when multiple solutions are available .",
    "we plan to pursue this line of inquiry in future work .",
    "the results may shed new light on the structure of cosmic - ray modified shocks .",
    "the authors acknowledge several stimulating conversations with frank jones and truong le .",
    "the authors are also grateful to the anonymous referee for several useful comments .",
    "pab also acknowledges support and hospitality from nasa via the nasa / asee summer faculty fellowship program at goddard space flight center .      in this section",
    "we demonstrate that the cosmic - ray energy flux must be continuous across a velocity discontinuity ( subshock ) , if one is present in the flow .",
    "this is turn implies that the subshock must be mediated entirely by the pressure of the background gas , and therefore the discontinuity is governed by the classical rankine - hugoniot jump conditions .",
    "the cosmic - ray energy flux in the @xmath302 direction is given by @xmath303 in a steady - state , the cosmic - ray energy equation  ( 2.7 ) reduces to @xmath304 which can be combined with equation  ( a1 ) to express the derivative of @xmath305 as @xmath306 integration in the vicinity of the subshock located at @xmath307 yields @xmath308 in order to avoid unphysical divergence of @xmath305 at the subshock , @xmath40 must be continuous , and therefore the integrand on the right - hand side of equation  ( a4 ) is no more singular than a step function .",
    "this implies that in the limit @xmath309 , the right - hand side vanishes , leaving @xmath310 hence @xmath305 remains constant across the subshock .",
    "the energy , momentum , and particle fluxes of the gas and the cosmic rays are therefore independently conserved across the discontinuity .",
