    "magnesium diboride powder was obtained by synthesis from the elements mg ( 98% pure ) and b ( 99.5% pure ) in an argon medium .",
    "the powder was sintered in a high - pressure chamber of the anvil - cell type with a lenticular cell .",
    "the necessary compression was provided by a hydraulic press with a 6300 kn force .",
    "the powder was heated to the required temperature , not by the conventional indirect heating,@xcite but by passing a current through the cylindrical samples to be sintered , which gave a more uniform temperature distribution over the volume of the sample .",
    "the preliminary compaction of the powder was done by a cold two - sided pressing at pressures of up to 1.3 gpa .",
    "the pressed sample was placed in a capsule of graphitic boron nitride , which was mounted in the working channel of the high - pressure chamber .",
    "after completion of the sintering cycle the material was cooled under pressure , and then the pressure was reduced to atmospheric .",
    "the rate of buildup and relief of the pressure was 0.5 gpa / s . during the heating and cooling stages",
    "the temperature was changed at a rate of 100 deg / s .",
    "the chosen construction of the cell of the high - pressure chamber provided for hydrostatic compression of the material to be sintered to pressures of up to 4.5 gpa and heating to temperatures of up to 2000 k with holds of up to 300 s.    according to the data of an x - ray analysis the samples contained magnesium diboride mgb@xmath0 and an insignificant amount of manganese oxide mgo .",
    "microstructural and fractographic studies of the samples were carried out on a camebax cx-50 setup .",
    "the x - ray microspectral analysis established the presence of the characteristic lines of magnesium , boron , and oxygen .",
    "a study of the real structure of the samples was done by the thin - foil and diffraction microanalysis methods with the use of a pm - u transmission electron microscope .",
    "the results of the study showed that the samples are characterized by appreciable scatter in the grain sizes : in addition to very fine particles ( @xmath1 @xmath2 m ) there are also rather large ones ( up to 30 @xmath2 m ) , in agreement with the results of ref .  .",
    "some of the large grains are highly fragmented , apparently as a result of the deformation during the preparation of the sample .",
    "it was noticed that those grains had a high density of defects , contained fine microcracks and pores , and had large dislocation pileups ( fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "the data of electron microanalysis also attest to strong fragmentation : most of the reflections were smeared into arcs .",

    "the presence of interlayers of an amorphous phase , similar to that observed in ref . , was noted .",
    "as far as we know , no experimental results from measurements of the sound velocity in mgb@xmath0 have been published yet . in imperfect samples",
    "the most reliable data on the sound velocity can be obtained only by analysis of the first signal , which has passed through the sample along the shortest path .",
    "interconversion of different modes at inhomogeneities ( including at grain boundaries ) makes the more distant reflections less suitable for measurements , as does to use of some version of a resonance methods .",
    "the method used in this paper was modified somewhat from that described in ref .  .",
    "in essence it consists in the measurement , in a fixed frequency interval , of the phase  frequency characteristics of two acoustic lines , consisting of delay lines with a sample between them and delay lines without a sample ( fig .",
    "the difference of the phase  frequency curves in the absence of interference distortions in the sample is a straight line with a slope determined by the sound velocity that is sought ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) . for millimeter sample lengths",
    "the error of measurement of the absolute value of the frequency at frequencies of @xmath4 mhz lies in the range 0.20.3% at a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath5 .",

    "lower : line 1 - the phase  frequency characteristic ( pfc ) of two dl only ; line 2 - pfc of two dl and s ; line 2 - 1 - the difference between pfc2 and pfc1 .",
    "sound velocity is determinated by equation @xmath7 , @xmath8 - the slope of the line 2 - 1 @xmath9 ; @xmath10 - the sample length ( 0.49 cm ) . ,",
    "width=283 ]    the velocity values measured at @xmath11 k ( acoustic path length @xmath12 mm ) , viz . , @xmath13 cm / s and @xmath14 cm / s are only effective values , since defects ( pores , microcracks ) decrease the sound propagation velocity.@xcite the mgb@xmath0 sample under study had a well - defined geometric shape , making it possible to estimate its porosity ( @xmath15 rather accurately by a simple weighing .",
    "using the approach proposed in ref . , we obtained the corrected values of the velocities : @xmath16 cm / s and @xmath17 cm / s .",
    "finally , the limitations imposed in the porous - medium model make this procedure much more uncertain than the error of measurement of the effective values of the velocity .",
    "the values obtained are considerably lower than the calculated values,@xcite although it may be that the correction introduced is not complete , since it does not make allowance for the presence of microcracks .",
    "starting from the corrected values of the velocities and the x - ray density , we calculated the bulk modulus ( @xmath18 gpa ) and debye temperature ( @xmath19 k ) .",
    "the latter value is close to that corresponding to the quantities obtained from heat - capacity measurements ( @xmath20@xmath21 k ; see the literature cited in ref .  ) .",
    "the critical temperature ( @xmath22 k ) and transition width ( @xmath23 k ) are determined from the measurements of the high - frequency magnetic susceptibility .    to estimate",
    "the dynamical parameters of the vortex lattice we have for the first time used the method proposed in ref .  ,",
    "wherein they are extracted from data on the conversion of transverse sound into an electromagnetic field .",
    "the sound wave vector @xmath24 was oriented parallel to the external magnetic field @xmath25 and orthogonal to the mgb@xmath0free - space interface .",
    "the electromagnetic radiation was registered by a coil oriented with the plane of its windings also parallel to @xmath25 .",
    "the amplitude and phase of the hall component of the electromagnetic field were measured ( the electric field vector @xmath26 was orthogonal to the displacement vector * u * in the sound wave ) .",
    "such experiments had been done before ( only the amplitude @xmath26 had been recorded ) on either low - temperature@xcite or high - temperature@xcite superconductors , and a simplified theoretical approach to their description is proposed in ref .. however , the relations obtained in ref . do not admit a correct passage to the limit of the normal state , as will be necessary in order to obtain quantitative information ( see below ) .",
    "here @xmath28 is the induction in the sample , which is practically equal to the external field @xmath29 except in a narrow field region around @xmath30 .",
    "the wave numbers appearing in ( 1 ) have the following model dependences on temperature and field :      where @xmath33 is the low - temperature penetration depth in the meissner phase , @xmath34 is the skin penetration depth ( @xmath35 ; @xmath36 is the conductivity of the normal metal ) , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the critical values of the temperature and magnetic field ) .",
    "+ the complex quantity @xmath41 ( @xmath42 is the coefficient of friction and @xmath43 is the labusch `` spring '' parameter ) describes the dynamics of the vortex lattice , which vibrates during the propagation of an elastic wave .",
    "bardeen and stephen@xcite gave a simple estimate for @xmath42 : @xmath44 .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and eq .",
    "( 1 ) reduces to the known expression for a normal metal in the local limit.@xcite in the normal state the phase of @xmath50 leads @xmath51 by @xmath52 , and @xmath53 varies linearly with @xmath29 , with a slope @xmath54 . according to published data,@xcite for mgb@xmath0",
    "the penetration depth @xmath33 lies in the range 8002000  . at the frequencies used here @xmath55 , and",
    "therefore for @xmath56 and at practically any temperature we have @xmath57 , and relation ( 1 ) reduces to @xmath58 which is suitable all the way down to the meissner state .",
    "we emphasize that the factor multiplying @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , unlike the situation in eq .  ( 1 ) , is not identical to the bending modulus @xmath60 of the vortex lattice , since the latter should soften as @xmath61 is approached.@xcite for @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 both eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 1 ) reduce to the corresponding relation for the normal metal at any value of @xmath66 .",
    "this means that even in an ideally homogeneous sample the electric field @xmath50 changes continuously ( without a jump ) at the transition of @xmath29 through @xmath61 .",
    "as @xmath29 is decreased further , the evolution of @xmath50 depends on the relationship between @xmath67 , @xmath43 , and the elastic modulus @xmath68 of the vortex lattice .",
    "obviously , sooner or later the situation @xmath69 will arise , and in that case the phase of @xmath50 will coincide with the phase of @xmath51 , and @xmath53 will also vary linearly with the field , but now with a unit slope . thus in the case @xmath70 relation ( 2 ) describes the behavior of @xmath50 in the entire field interval from @xmath61 to @xmath30 .",
    "the measured @xmath50 curves are presented in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . in view of the limited range of magnetic fields accessible in our measurements",
    ", informative experiments could be done only at rather high temperatures .",
    "we see that the phase of the signal at the transition of @xmath29 through @xmath61 changes by approximately @xmath71 ( fig.[f3]a ) .",
    "the ratio of the slopes ( @xmath72 in the regions of linear variation of @xmath73 is in good agreement with the value that follows from our analysis : @xmath74 ( fig.[f3]b ) .",
    "knowing @xmath75 , we can estimate the depth of the skin layer in the normal phase at the frequencies used here ( @xmath76 cm ) and the resistivity at @xmath77 ( @xmath78 @xmath79 .",
    "relation ( 2 ) can easily be inverted to extract the real and imaginary parts of @xmath80 from experimental data without any additional assumptions .",
    "of course , this can be done in the case when one is able to track the variation of both the modulus and phase of @xmath50 in the accessible magnetic field region .",
    "it is also obvious that this procedure is doable only in that field region where the amplitude and phase of @xmath50 deviate noticeably from their limiting values .",
    "the result of such a construction is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath42 varies practically linearly with applied field . for a known @xmath36 ,",
    "the slope of this relation is determined , in accordance with ref .  , by the value of @xmath61 .",

    "[ f4 ] by a straight line passing through the origin gave @xmath81 t , practically equal to the field that determines the beginning of the change in the phase of @xmath50 at @xmath82 k ( fig .",
    "this means that in the mgb@xmath0 sample under study , @xmath61 is limited by the condition of overlap of the cores of the vortices and not by the clogston paramagnetic limit.@xcite    it is seen from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] that the main change in the phase of @xmath50 is practically finished by the start of the deviation of @xmath73 from the linear dependence characterizing the normal phase .",
    "this means that in this stage the inequality @xmath83 holds , and @xmath43 can be estimated either by inverting relation ( 2 ) with @xmath84 or simply from the relation @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the characteristic field at which the transition of @xmath73 from one linear trend to another occurs . in particular , for @xmath87",
