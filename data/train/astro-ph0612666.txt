    "the cosmological applications of type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) result from precise distances to these calibrated candles .",
    "it has been well established that the intrinsic luminosity of sn ia is correlated with the shape of their optical light curves ( phillips  1993 ; hamuy et al .",
    "1995 ; riess , press , & kirshner 1995a ; hamuy et al .",
    "1996a ; riess , press , & kirshner 1996a ) .",
    "determining a precise distance requires well - observed sn ia light curves in multiple passbands , to constrain the intrinsic luminosity and extinction by dust along the line of sight to each sn ia .",
    "a number of methods have been developed to measure calibrated distances from sn ia multicolor light curves , with each enjoying a similar level of success .",
    "the first of these was introduced by phillips  ( 1993 ) , who noted that the parameter @xmath7 , the amount by which a sn ia declined in the @xmath8-band during the first fifteen days after maximum light , was well correlated with sn ia intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the @xmath9  method was transformed by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , in which @xmath9  became a parameter in a multi - dimensional fit to six template light curves spanning a wide range in @xmath7  as it was originally defined .",
    "phillips et al .  ( 1999 ) present the current version of this method , which incorporates measurement of the extinction via late - time  color measurements ( roughly independent of @xmath9 ) and  and  measurements at maximum light ( for the measured @xmath9 , determined in an iterative fashion ) .",
    "updates to this technique are given by germany et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and prieto , rest , & suntzeff ( 2006 ) , the latter developing a technique to describe a continuous family of light curves parameterized by @xmath9 .",
    "tripp & branch  ( 1999 ) present a two - parameter method , empirically correlating sn ia luminosity to @xmath9  and maximum light  color , but without regard to the source of the color variation ( i.e. , extinction or intrinsic variation ) .",
    "parodi et al .  ( 2000 ) and reindl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) present similar studies , with empirical correlations between sn ia maximum light magnitudes in , @xmath9  and color .",
    "other methods include the stretch correction of perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , in which the sn ia intrinsic luminosity is correlated with a simple stretching of the time axis of a fiducial light curve . this method has been presented in detail for the @xmath8 band ( goldhaber et al .",
    "2001 ) , and can be extended straightforwardly to @xmath1 and @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 and @xmath12 posing more difficulty ; nugent , kim , & perlmutter 2002 ; knop et al .",
    "2003 ; nobili et al .  2005 ; jha et al .",
    "guy et al .",
    "( 2005 ) use an innovative approach to constrain the spectral energy distribution of sn ia , parameterized continuously as a function of color and stretch , and allows for the generation of light curve templates in arbitrary passbands . these methods all",
    "determine distances by correlating a distance - dependent parameter ( such as peak magnitude in a particular passband , or an average magnitude difference between the observations and templates ) and one or more distance - independent parameters ( such as color , stretch , or @xmath9 ) .",
    "wang et al .  ( 2003 ) describe a novel technique which derives distances based on `` light curves '' as a function of color rather than time , which may have interesting implications for the physics behind the observed correlations .",
    "finally , tonry et al .  ( 2003 ) follow a non - parametric approach , by directly fitting an observed multicolor light curve to a library of nearby sn ia , and deriving an average distance weighted by the goodness of fit to each object in the library .    here",
    "we describe an updated version of the multicolor light curve shape method , denoted here as mlcs2k2 .",
    "riess , press , & kirshner ( 1995a ) presented the first incarnation of this method ( called lcs as it was based only on @xmath10 band data ) , in which a continuum of template light curves was created based on a `` training set '' of sn ia with known relative distances and the parameter @xmath13 , a particular sn s under- or over - luminosity relative to some fiducial value .",
    "the luminosity correction , @xmath13 , was used as a parameter in a least - squares fit , resulting in a best - fit distance for each sn , along with a quantitative estimate of the uncertainty .",
    "the mlcs method , presented by riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996a ) gave the details of the model , as well as incorporating light curves and providing an estimate of extinction by dust .",
    "riess et al .  ( 1998a ) updated the training set , using reliable distances measured by the hubble law in favor of other methods , added a quadratic ( @xmath14 ) term to create the template light curves , and included the effects of covariance in the model .",
    "the application of this version of mlcs to nearby sn ia and the hubble constant is given by jha et al .",
    "( 1999a ) .",
    "the mlcs approach has some advantages : by using a relatively large training set to define a continuum of templates , the method becomes less sensitive to peculiarities of individual objects . during the training process ,",
    "the variance and covariance in the residuals determine the uncertainty in the model , and this is then used to determine statistically reliable estimates of goodness - of - fit and parameter uncertainties when the model is applied to other objects .",
    "the model also attempts a physically motivated separation of extinction by dust from intrinsic color variations ( rather than empirical correlations with color ) , and uses all of the light curves ( at all epochs ) to constrain the extinction .",
    "finally the model is easily extended , for example , with the inclusion of a quadratic term in @xmath13 , or the incorporation of the @xmath1-band presented here .",
    "the major disadvantage is that the method requires accurate estimates of luminosity and extinction for the training set sample in order to construct reliable templates .",
    "we have compiled modern multicolor photoelectric and ccd johnson / cousins data from a variety of sources .",
    "the precision of sn ia distances demands high quality photometry , and we have relied most heavily on large , homogeneous data sets , such as the observations presented by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996b ) from the caln / tololo survey ( 29 sn ia ) , as well as those of riess et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and jha et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , consisting of 22 and 44 sn ia , respectively , from the cfa monitoring campaign .",
    "the complete sample we analyze consists of 133 sn ia described in table [ ch4-tab - sninfo ] . for a number of objects we have combined data sets from different sources ( see jha et al .",
    "2006 for some comparisons ) ; in some cases we had to make subjective assessments of the relative quality of inconsistent data .",
    "the basic framework for mlcs2k2 was laid out by jha ( 2002 ) and it has already been applied to sn ia cosmology , including the silver and gold samples of riess et al .",
    "this work showed that the universe underwent a transition from an epoch of deceleration due to dark matter to current acceleration driven by dark energy , whose inferred properties are consistent with the cosmological constant .",
    "in addition , riess et al .",
    "( 2005 ) use mlcs2k2 distances to show various estimates of @xmath15 from sn ia can be reconciled through the use of modern cepheid and supernova data , deriving @xmath15 = 73 @xmath4 4 ( statistical ) @xmath4 5 ( systematic ) @xmath16 . in this paper , we focus only on relative distances to nearby sn , independent of the zeropoint derived from external measurements ( e.g. , cepheid distances to sn ia hosts ; freedman et al .  2001 ; sandage et al .",

    "comparison of light curves from many sn ia requires understanding and correction for a number of effects to put the photometry on a common basis . these include corrections from the observational photometric system to standard passbands , correction for galactic extinction , correction for time dilation and the @xmath0-correction .",
    "we have updated a number of these foundations in our development of mlcs2k2 .",
    "the stretching and shifting of spectra due to the cosmological expansion leads to changes in measured flux observed through a fixed detector passband as a function of redshift .",
    "@xmath0-corrections for sn ia in @xmath8 and @xmath10 have been presented by hamuy et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , based on spectra of three objects .",
    "kim , goobar , & perlmutter  ( 1996 ) provide additional @xmath0-corrections in @xmath11 , as well as developing a method of `` cross - filter '' @xmath0-corrections used at high redshift .",
    "these methods use a fixed set of spectra to define the @xmath0-correction for all objects , and do not include spectral energy distribution ( sed ) variations arising from intrinsic differences among supernovae ( either in the detailed spectral features or in the continuum shape ) or changes in in the sed due to extinction .",
    "nugent , kim , & perlmutter ( 2002 ) developed a method that accounts for these variations with a simple , yet effective , `` trick '' in which both the intrinsic and extinction - related sed variations are effected by adjusting the sed by the @xmath19 extinction law of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ; hereinafter ccm89 ) to match the color of the sn as observed .",
    "this procedure is reasonably well motivated ; at early times , sn ia are in the photospheric phase and the sed is continuum dominated , so that adjustment of the sed by a relatively slowly varying function of wavelength , like the ccm89 extinction law , to match the observed color will do a good job of mimicking the true sed . at late times , much of the color variation is due , in fact , to extinction and so the adjustment is appropriate .",
    "furthermore , the adjustment is done using a color `` local '' to the spectral region being adjusted , minimizing any adverse effects .",
    "the difference in the @xmath0-correction accounting for these color variations and assuming a constant color for all objects is typically small ( generally @xmath20 mag ) , but systematic .",
    "nugent et al .  ( 2002 ) show the efficacy of this color - based procedure .",
    "our concern in this paper is for accurate @xmath0-corrections at low redshift ( @xmath21 ) , so we restrict our attention to @xmath0-corrections within each passband , not the cross - filter @xmath0-correction .",
    "we have implemented the nugent et al .",
    "( 2002 ) procedure using a sample of 91 sn ia spectra covering phases from @xmath1814 to @xmath1792 days past maximum light , compiled from a number of sources , including archival iue and hst data , keck and lick observatory sn ia spectra from uc berkeley ( filippenko 1997 ) , and unpublished spectra from the cfa sn ia follow - up program ( matheson et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) . of these ,",
    "57 spectra extend far enough to the red to cover the @xmath12 passband , while 32 spectra cover the @xmath1 passband in the blue .",
    "the number of spectra that cover the @xmath1-band decreases quickly as the spectra are artificially redshifted to calculate the @xmath0-correction ; however , of the 133 sn ia described here , the maximum redshift for which there are @xmath1 observations is only @xmath22 , meaning that is the extent to which we need to calculate @xmath23 .    to derive the @xmath0-corrections , the basic procedure is as follows . for each of ( we adopt the standard bessell  1990 passbands ) ,",
    "we choose standard colors including that passband ( specifically , for @xmath1 : ; @xmath8 :  and ; @xmath10 : , , and ; @xmath11 :  and ; @xmath12 :  and ) .",
    "then for a particular combination of passband and color , we calculate @xmath0-corrections in that passband , such that the spectra are forced to take on a range of observed colors , using the ccm89 extinction law to adjust the spectra to any particular color .",
    "thus , we tabulate the @xmath0-correction as a function of three parameters : epoch ( i.e. , days after maximum light ) , redshift and color .",
    "we measure the colors in the observer frame , so that for example , to determine the @xmath0-correction in the @xmath10-band for a supernova at maximum light at redshift @xmath24 with an observed = 0.0 mag , we have taken our maximum light spectra , redshifted them to @xmath24 , adjusted them using the ccm89 extinction law to have = 0.0 as measured with synthetic photometry , and calculated the @xmath0-correction for that adjusted spectrum . in this example , the answer is @xmath25 mag , where the uncertainty is measured from the scatter among the individual spectra about a smooth curve . if the observed color had been redder , e.g. , = 0.5 mag , then @xmath26 mag .",
    "the advantage of calculating the @xmath0-correction as a function of observer - frame color ( as opposed to the sn rest - frame color ) is that no iteration is then required : the measured color directly determines the sn sed in the observer frame .",
    "however , in other applications , for example , if one wants to transform rest - frame templates ( with known rest - frame colors ) to the observer - frame , it is more convenient to tabulate the @xmath0-correction as a function of rest - frame color . for the present sample , all sn have well - measured ( to better than @xmath270.1 mag ) observer - frame colors , so we can apply the @xmath0-corrections to the data directly , and expediently fit the sn in the rest frame . though not used here , we are also developing an implementation of mlcs2k2 to take rest - frame model light curves , convert them into the observer frame , and then fit the observed data directly .",
    "that approach is more appropriate , e.g. , for high - redshift observations where observer - frame color information is of lower quality and @xmath0-corrections based on the model light - curve colors should be used .",
    "-corrections in the @xmath1-band .",

    "( 1998a ) , the diagonal elements of the @xmath105 matrix are derived from the variance about the model , while the off - diagonal elements are estimated from two - point correlations ( in the same passband at different epochs , in different passbands at the same epoch and in different passbands at different epochs ) .",
    "armed with the template vectors and the model covariance matrix , we can apply the model .",
    "along with the light curve observations @xmath97 , conscientious observers provide a covariance matrix of `` noise '' , @xmath106 , albeit typically only a diagonal one consisting of the variance of each data point ( even though sn light curve data can be highly correlated , for instance in the fact that all the light curve points are usually referenced to the same few field comparison stars ) .",
    "we correct these data for galactic extinction , and incorporate the uncertainty estimate of schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , whereby @xmath107 , updating both the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of @xmath106 ( the uncertainties in the galactic extinction correction are highly correlated , but generally small ) .",
    "we also apply the @xmath0-correction (  [ ch4-sec - kcorr ] ) , and incorporate the @xmath0-correction uncertainty in the diagonal elements of n ( unfortunately we do not have enough data to estimate the @xmath0-correction correlations ) and correct for time dilation .",
    "we find the best - fit model parameters via @xmath108 minimization , with @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the vector of residuals ( in all bands ) for a given set of model parameters , and @xmath111 .",
    "we use a downhill simplex method ( amoeba ; press et al .",
    "1992 ) to perform the minimization ( though linear algebra suffices in solving for @xmath101 and @xmath63 , if the other model parameters are fixed ) and determine their best - fit parameters .",
    "because the @xmath105 matrix is empirically determined from the training set , application of the model to objects in the training set will necessarily have a minimum reduced @xmath112 ( @xmath113 per degree of freedom ) close to unity , but in applying the model to other objects , the minimum @xmath112 still yields useful goodness - of - fit information ( indicating how similar the light curves of the new object are to those in the training set , given the nature of the model ) .",
    "we have also incorporated the ability to add priors on any of the model parameters directly into the fit .",
    "the previous versions of mlcs , for instance , used a bayesian filter requiring the extinction to be non - negative , but this was enforced after the best fits were determined .",
    "the advantage of that approach was convenience and expediency , but at the expense of ignoring correlations among the parameters .",
    "those versions of mlcs used @xmath114 , the distance modulus uncorrected for extinction , as the basic distance model parameter rather than @xmath115 , in order to minimize this undesirable correlation , thus making the bayesian filter simple and effective . however , there are situations in which one might like to include other prior information into the fit .",
    "for example , a sparsely - sampled light curve may not allow for a good determination of the time of maximum light , but we may have other information about the time of maximum from spectroscopy ( riess et al .",
    "1997a ) . in the extreme limit of the `` snapshot '' method , ( riess et al",
    ".  1998b ) , spectroscopy could be used to determine prior constraints on both @xmath99 and @xmath13 .",
    "alternately , we may have observations in additional , non - modeled passbands ( such as in the near - infrared ) , which impose prior constraints on @xmath63 or @xmath6 . incorporating priors , @xmath116 , into the fit",
    "is straightforward , we simply adjust the @xmath108 to @xmath117 taking care to reinterpret this `` @xmath108 '' in the proper way when estimating the goodness of the model fit ( which depends only on the first term , as opposed to the parameter uncertainties ) .",
    "this procedure allows the parameters to be `` naturally '' filtered during the fit .",
    "the training set is the most critical part of the analysis ; it requires objects with accurate estimates of the model parameters , in order to construct the template vectors and covariance matrix . as in riess",
    "et al .  ( 1998a ) , we use the hubble law to determine precise relative distances , thus useful objects in the training set need to have recession velocities that are dominated by cosmological expansion , not peculiar motions .",
    "the objects also need to have well - measured light curves at maximum light so that @xmath99 and @xmath118 ( to be used in determining @xmath13 , as below ) can be reliably determined .",
    "finally , we require accurate host - galaxy extinction estimates for the training set objects .",
    "this estimate comes from well - sampled @xmath8 and @xmath10 light curves at the epochs past @xmath71 days when the intrinsic color is not a strong function of luminosity , as described in  [ ch4-sec - ex0 ] . ideally , we would also like estimates of the host - galaxy extinction law @xmath6 for each sn , but these are not easily determined _ a priori _ , and values based on the sn light curves themselves would require knowledge of the intrinsic colors we are trying to determine !",
    "to avoid this conundrum , then , we restrict the initial training sample to objects not very significantly reddened ( as determined from the  color at @xmath2735 days past maximum ) , so that variation in @xmath6 does not have a large effect , allowing us to fix @xmath6 = 3.1 for the initial training set .    our initial training set consists of 37 sn ia , with @xmath119 ( measured in the cmb frame ) and well - sampled light curves beginning earlier than 10 days past maximum light : sn 1990o , 1990af , 1992p , 1992ae , 1992al , 1992bc , 1992bg , 1992bl , 1992bo , 1992bp , 1992br , 1993h , 1993o , 1993ag , 1994 m , 1995ac , 1996c , 1996bl , 1997e , 1997y , 1997bq , 1998v , 1998ab , 1998bp , 1998de , 1998es , 1999aa , 1999ac , 1999da , 1999gp , 2000ca , 2000cf , 2000dk , 2000fa , 2001v , 2001cz , and 2002er . for each sn",
    ", we initially calculate @xmath13 as the difference between @xmath10 magnitude at maximum light ( corrected for host - galaxy extinction ) and the hubble line given the host - galaxy redshift .",
    "we assign an uncertainty in @xmath13 from the quadrature sum of the uncertainty in the direct fit of @xmath120 , the extinction uncertainty and a distance uncertainty based on a peculiar velocity uncertainty of @xmath121 .",
    "these initial guesses of @xmath13 span a range of over two magnitudes , and the sample includes a wide range of over- and under - luminous objects .    from the initial guesses of the model parameters and uncertainties , we derive the best fit vectors , @xmath100 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , as well as the model covariance matrix @xmath105 , all of which are sampled daily over the range @xmath122 days past @xmath8 maximum , where the data are constraining . with these vectors , we can apply this initial model to our larger sample of supernovae ; deriving new estimates of @xmath13 and @xmath102 while constraining the distance moduli to their hubble law estimates ( within the uncertainties listed above ) .",
    "iterating this procedure leads to convergence on a consistent set of model parameters , template vectors and a model covariance matrix.0.5 mag to @xmath1230.2 mag .",
    "we thus choose to retain the largest training set sample we can to most robustly determine the templates and , importantly , their associated model uncertainty . ]    in figure [ ch4-fig - templates ] , we present the one - parameter family of unreddened template light curves in over a wide range of luminosity , based on the final template vectors derived in the training process . the characteristic result that intrinsically brighter sn ia ( low @xmath13 ) have broader light curves is clearly established in all passbands .",
    "we note that while @xmath13 is originally estimated by the relative v - band magnitude difference at maximum light , during the iterative training the meaning of @xmath13 changes . it should be viewed simply as a unitless fit parameter that describes the family of light curves , and",
    "can differ significantly from its original value for a given supernova .",
    "in particular , it should not be subtracted directly from @xmath120 to obtain a corrected peak magnitude , though this has been a convenient usage in the past . and @xmath124 to convergence at @xmath125 and @xmath126 . ] the fiducial mlcs2k2 @xmath127 model light curve has @xmath7= 1.07 ( read directly off the @xmath8-band template ) and stretch parameter , @xmath128 ( fit as described by jha et al .",
    "2006 ) . the intrinsic absolute @xmath10 magnitude at the time of @xmath8 maximum light is given by @xmath129    , shown over a range of luminosity and light - curve shape from @xmath130 ( brighter ) to @xmath131 ( fainter ) . [ ch4-fig - templates],width=576 ]    ) .",
    "[ ch4-fig - colors],height=576 ]    the mlcs2k2 relations also allow us to determine the intrinsic colors of sn ia with varying luminosity at any epoch . in figure [ ch4-fig - colors ] , we show a sample of the color relations in , , and , at maximum light and 35 days after maximum .",
    "our fiducial @xmath127 sn ia has @xmath132 mag , @xmath133 mag , @xmath134 mag , and @xmath135 mag , at the time of @xmath8 maximum light .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion in these colors is captured in the model covariance matrix . because the intrinsic colors are determined by the model at any epoch ,",
    "all of the observations can be used to constrain the extinction and @xmath13 , weighted by the observational and model uncertainties .",
    "this is a more flexible approach than just using late - time or maximum - light relations to determine the extinction ( e.g. , phillips et al .",
    "1999 ) , or using colors at one specific epoch to determine the intrinsic luminosity and extinction ( e.g. , at @xmath136 days , as suggested by wang et al .",
    "we have applied the model to our full sample of 133 sn ia , employing priors , @xmath137 , via equation [ ch4-eqn - chisq ] .",
    "of course , in applying the model to a sn ia light curve we impose no prior constraints on the distance modulus , @xmath101 .",
    "we require @xmath99 to be within @xmath43 days of the input estimate used to derive the time - dependent galactic extinction and k - corrections ; in cases where the fit @xmath99 is outside this range or otherwise inconsistent with the input value , we start the fit over using the updated estimate for @xmath99 .",
    "we use a uniform prior on @xmath13 over the range @xmath138 , with a gaussian rolloff ( with @xmath139 ) on either side of that range ; this restricts the fits to the range of @xmath13 encompassed by the training set ( roughly between @xmath180.4 and 1.7 ) and for which the model is valid .",
    "we do not see objects in our sample `` piling up '' at these boundaries , but it will be important to check that application of mlcs2k2 to a new object does not require a fit that extrapolates beyond the training set .    additionally , we constrain the maximum light host - galaxy extinction parameter @xmath102 to be non - negative , as well as incorporate the results of our determination of the sn ia intrinsic color and reddening distributions (  [ ch4-sec - ex0 ] ) .",
    "there we determined that the host - galaxy reddening distribution was well described by an exponential with a scale length of @xmath140 mag . because our mlcs2k2 model parameter is @xmath102 , the maximum light extinction in @xmath10 , we need to convert the results based on the late - time  color , multiplying by @xmath141 ( to change from @xmath33 to @xmath142 ) and dividing by @xmath143 . with average late - time values of these quantities ,",
    "we derive our final prior on the maximum light host - galaxy extinction , @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "our results show little sensitivity to the exact value for the exponential scale in the denominator .",
    "finally , we use a prior constraint on @xmath6 estimated from its distribution over multiple lines of sight to stars in the galaxy ( ccm89 ) . for @xmath146",
    ", we adopt a functional form that is gaussian in @xmath147 with a mean @xmath148 and standard deviation @xmath149 .",
    "the choice of a prior on @xmath6 has a significant effect on the best - fit parameters of heavily extinguished sn ia , and we discuss this issue more fully below (  [ ch4-sec - rv ] ) .    to fit the mlcs2k2 model , we first calculate @xmath108 ( equation [ ch4-eqn - chisq ] ) over a four - dimensional grid of ( @xmath99 , @xmath101 , @xmath13 , @xmath102 ) , with a fixed @xmath19 . because variation in the reddening law has only a very small effect on the measured distance",
    "if the extinction is low , we expand this to a five - dimensional grid ( including @xmath6 as a fit parameter ) just for those objects which show @xmath150 mag in the initial fit .",
    "though mapping @xmath108 over a large grid is computationally expensive , it allows us to fully explore our non - linear model , and makes evident , for example , objects which could be well fit in separate regions of parameter space or otherwise have a complicated @xmath108 surface ( which can occur especially for sn ia with sparse photometry ) .    in figure [ ch4-fig - sampfit ]",
    "we show example light curve fits for sn 2000fa and sn 1999gh ( jha et al .",
    "2006 ) , whose light curves are typical in the nearby sn ia sample .",
    "sn 2000fa has a slightly broader light curve than average and is moderately extinguished by dust in its host galaxy , while sn 1999gh is a fast - declining , subluminous sn ia with little host extinction .",
    "the shaded regions in the figure show the model uncertainty ( more precisely , the square root of the diagonal elements of @xmath105 ) which generally dominates the uncertainty in the data .    , width=576 ]    from the likelihood grid we calculate @xmath151 , the posterior probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "we marginalize this distribution to determine the pdfs of the parameters of interest .",
    "though the full surface is difficult to visualize or present , we show all of the two - dimensional marginalizations of the probability densities for sn 2000fa and sn 1999gh in figure [ ch4-fig - grids ] , clearly illustrating bivariate correlations among the model parameters .",
    "finally , in figure [ ch4-fig - oneds ] we show the one - dimensional pdfs for each of the model parameters .",
    "our best estimate of each parameter is given by the _",
    "mean _ of these distributions ( not the mode / peak ) , and their standard deviations give an estimate of the uncertainty .",
    "note that in some cases these distributions are asymmetric or otherwise non - gaussian ( for example , @xmath152 for sn 1999gh ) , so the mean and standard deviation do not always provide a complete description . in typical cases ,",
    "however , the distribution of @xmath101 , the parameter of primary interest , can be well approximated by a gaussian .",
    "while derivative calculations based on these parameters ( fitting the hubble diagram , for example ) should formally employ the full pdf , we have found that after combination of just a few objects , the formally correct ( but computationally intensive ) method yields results indistinguishable from those based on the means and standard deviations .",
    "confidence regions ( more precisely , 68.3% , 95.4% , and 99.7% enclosed probability regions ) , while the dotted lines show -@xmath82 contours .",
    "[ ch4-fig - grids],height=739 ]    , height=739 ]    we present the full results of the mlcs2k2 fits to our sn ia sample in table [ ch4-tab - mlcs ] .",
    "the tabulated values correspond to the means and standard deviations of the posterior pdf for each parameter taken _ individually _ , i.e. marginalizing over all the other parameters .",
    "as such the model derived from setting each parameter to its mean value does not correspond exactly to the true best fit ( at which the pdf is maximized ) , though the difference is typically small .",
    "since we are generally interested in the individual parameter distributions ( and the distance modulus in particular ) , it is more useful to present the fit results in this form .",
    "two objects , sn 2000cx and sn 2002cx , can not be fit by mlcs2k2 .",
    "li et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2003 ) discuss the peculiarity of these objects , whose light curves are distinct from the vast majority of sn ia . in addition , sn 1998d and sn 1999cw have poor fits , with very broad or multi - peaked pdfs .",
    "both of these objects have a paucity of data ( no more than three photometric points in any filter ) , and more importantly , the first observations for each object occurred well after maximum light ( @xmath1732 and @xmath1724 days , respectively ; see table [ ch4-tab - sninfo ] ) .",
    "this allows for a wide range of models to fit the data well , and the uncertain results are not very informative , but we present them for completeness .    finally ,",
    "analysis of the distance modulus residuals ( see  [ ch4-sec - hflow ] and [ ch4-sec - bubble ] ) leads us to conclude that the @xmath101 ( and @xmath153 ) uncertainties listed in table [ ch4-tab - mlcs ] are slightly underestimated .",
    "this is likely due to our less - than - perfect knowledge of the model covariance matrix @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , our analysis shows that the objects with the smallest distance uncertainties are the ones that show the strongest evidence for unmodeled variance , suggesting there is a systematic floor to the distance uncertainty ( as opposed to a multiplicative factor to adjust all the uncertainties ) .",
    "we thus recommend that the @xmath101 and @xmath153 uncertainties in table [ ch4-tab - mlcs ] be increased by adding @xmath154 0.08 mag in quadrature to yield a final estimate of @xmath155 and @xmath156 , and we adopt this augmented uncertainty for all subsequent results .",

    "observations further in the uv would be increasingly sensitive to variations in @xmath6 , but they are difficult to obtain ( requiring space - based data for nearby extinguished sn ia or very deep ground - based data for distant extinguished sn ia for which the desired wavelengths redshift past the atmospheric cutoff ) , and the intrinsic sn ia magnitudes and dispersions are unexplored at these wavelengths . on the other hand , near - infrared data will be extremely valuable in providing a long wavelength baseline to constrain both the extinction and the extinction law ( e.g. , krisciunas et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "we are currently developing a method to incorporate infrared photometry into mlcs2k2 by using observations in @xmath273 to provide a joint prior constraint on @xmath6 and @xmath102 , that is then used to fit the optical data ( jha , prieto , & krisciunas , in preparation ) .",
    "what are the effects of possible variations in @xmath6 on our derived mlcs2k2 distances ?",
    "the results from the extinguished objects with a uniform prior have a mean @xmath274 ( with the default mlcs2k2 prior , the mean is 2.9 ) .",
    "the majority of the hubble flow sample has low extinction , where @xmath6 variation has nearly negligible effects , and we had fixed @xmath275 for objects with @xmath276 mag .",
    "we have refit the full hubble flow sample using a new prior with the same shape but @xmath274 , as well as a fixed @xmath277 for objects with @xmath276 mag . on average ,",
    "the distance moduli increase by 0.019 mag , with an average increase for the fixed @xmath6 subsample of 0.014 mag ( both corresponding to less than a 1% increase in distance ) .",
    "the effect of a smaller @xmath6 on differential measurements ( such as determining @xmath15 from the hubble flow sample and a cepheid calibrated sample ) would be less , because all distances would be slightly increased . at present",
    ", we find no compelling evidence to favor a constant @xmath278 over @xmath19 _ for low - extinction sn ia samples _ such as are typically used in cosmological applications . allowing for @xmath6 variations over this range could yield a plausible estimate of the systematic uncertainty , but more problematic for precision cosmology would be a systematic change in the @xmath6 distribution with redshift ,    we thank alex filippenko , weidong li , kevin krisciunas , and nick suntzeff for providing access to unpublished spectroscopy and photometry .",

    "measurements of the luminosity distances to type ia supernovae need to account for the line - of - sight absorption by dust to yield a precise and accurate estimate .",
    "the most common approach is to measure the color excess resulting from selective absorption , and with the use of a reddening law , estimate the extinction .",
    "unfortunately , uncertainty in the fiducial color frequently dominates the individual distance uncertainty , arising from the uncertainty ( added in quadrature ) of two true flux measurements and the intrinsic dispersion of sn ia colors .",
    "frequent and high precision monitoring of nearby sn ia can remove the contribution of measurement uncertainty , revealing the intrinsic color dispersion to be approximately 0.05 mag for optical colors as shown in figure [ ch4-fig - zerocol ] . multiplying this intrinsic uncertainty by a standard reddening law , @xmath279 ,",
    "yields the observed sn ia distance dispersion of 0.15 - 0.20 mag . however , failure to measure colors to better precision than the intrinsic dispersion may result in greatly degraded distance precision .    a significant improvement in the extinction estimate can be realized by the use of a bayesian prior on the extinction parameter because a good deal is known about the likely values of extinction , _ a priori_. the most basic and unassailable truths about extinction are that it can not be negative and that increasing values are decreasingly likely due to the unlikely viewing angles required for large extinction , and for some surveys , magnitude limits .",
    "models by hatano , branch , & deaton ( 1998 ) , commins ( 2004 ) , and riello & patat ( 2005 ) show that for late type galaxies , the likelihood distribution for extinguished lines of sight follows an exponential function with a maximum at zero extinction . in figure [ ch4-fig - zerocol ]",
    "we use this function constrained by the a posteriori color distribution to determine a decay constant for the exponential of @xmath270.5 mag in @xmath142 .",
    "the use of such an extinction prior represents great potential improvement to this precision - limiting measure of sn ia distances .",
    "this approach was first used by riess , press , and kirshner ( 1996a ) and later by riess et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and phillips et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as well as in the present work . however , the well known danger of using a priori information is that it may be in error and thus propagate systematic errors into the final distance estimate .",
    "in addition , one must be careful to use an unbiased estimator of extinction from the posterior likelihood distribution to avoid additional systematic error . to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of using extinction priors for _ realistic _ measurements of sn ia ,",
    "we have undertaken a set of monte carlo simulations .",
    "our simulations model 10@xmath280 sn ia , each with a fixed intrinsic color drawn from a gaussian distribution ( with zero mean , and standard deviation @xmath281 ) and an extinction @xmath142 drawn from an exponential distribution ( with scale length @xmath282 ) .",
    "we then simulate @xmath283 measurements of the sn  color , each with a gaussian error @xmath284 , and subsequently `` fit '' for the extinction , determining its posterior probability distribution function with the application of a prior ( either the true one describing the input extinction distribution , a more conservative prior , none at all , or an incorrect one ) . for each posterior pdf",
    "we extract both the mean and the mode , calculate the error between the posterior estimate and the input extinction , and analyze this error distribution over the whole simulated sample .",
    "these quantities may also be calculated analytically using bayes s theorem , but we prefer the numerical approach for ease of the incorporation of a variety of functional forms for the extinction prior .    as an example , we show in figure [ fig - app1 ] the results for @xmath283 = 5 , @xmath284 = 0.1 mag , @xmath281 = 0.05 mag , and @xmath282 = 0.5 mag , parameters chosen to correspond to adequate but minimal color measurements , such as those used in riess et al .",
    "( 1998a ) for the detection of cosmic acceleration , and we have fit the simulated sample with both the correct prior ( @xmath285 , with @xmath282 = 0.5 mag ) and no prior at all ( allowing the fit @xmath142 to be negative as well ) .",
    "sn ia , with a gaussian intrinsic  color scatter of @xmath286 mag , `` observed '' on 5 epochs with a precision of @xmath287 mag in each color measurement .",
    "the sn are drawn from an exponential @xmath142 distribution with a scale length @xmath288 mag ( blue histogram ) , and then fit with a prior matching the extinction distribution ( black ) , as well as without any prior ( red ) . for each fit",
    ", the mean of the posterior extinction distribution ( with and without a prior ) is used as the extinction estimate , and these distributions are shown in the lower panel .",
    "the upper panel then shows the difference between the posterior mean extinction and the true extinction .",
    "use of the correct extinction prior shows no mean bias ( dotted lines ) , and improves the precision of the extinction measurement .",
    "[ fig - app1],height=624 ]    as shown , use of the mean of the individual extinction likelihoods results in an unbiased estimate of the extinction and an increased precision relative to the absence of an extinction prior .",
    "because the weight of distance estimates for cosmological parameter estimation is proportional to the square of the uncertainty , the precision of 0.18 mag per sn ia using the prior represents a 50% improvement over the use of no prior for this realistic case . for more poorly measured colors ( @xmath289 mag ) or fewer independent measurements , the improvement approaches a factor of two , akin to doubling the cosmological sample .    another way extinction priors yield benefits besides improved distance precision is by reining in errors in the knowledge of the intrinsic properties of sn ia .",
    "the most relevant example is our estimate of the fiducial , unreddened color of an sn ia , used to estimate the color excess and the net extinction . as an example we consider in figure [ fig - app2 ] the extinction bias resulting from a misestimate of the unreddened color ( with the previous minimal but adequate color measurements ) . without a prior",
    "the systematic extinction error is exactly the color error multiplied by the reddening law . with the prior ,",
    "the extinction error becomes smaller because the valuable knowledge about the likely extinction weighs in , reducing the effect of the measurement inaccuracy .",
    "taking a realistic example of an 0.03 mag mis - estimate in the unreddened color , the bias is reduced from 0.10 mag without a prior to 0.07 mag with the prior . however",
    ", the net bias for most cosmological measurements will be negligible if the color error ( and extinction distribution ) is independent of redshift . for cosmological measurements ,",
    "this color error may be usefully thought of as a _ color evolution_. again , for such a color evolution , the net bias is reduced by one - third with the use of an extinction prior .",
    "nonetheless , a basic disadvantage of using priors is that biases may result from the use of an incorrect prior.=10 , @xmath290 mag ) shows that the net bias is 0.02 mag in the distance difference at low and high redshifts , much smaller than the 0.05 mag error in the mean of the high - redshift sample . ] as an example we show in figure [ fig - app3 ] the extinction bias as a function of the exponential decay scale length assumed for the prior .",
    "values differing from the input of @xmath291 mag result in an under- or over - estimate of the mean extinction . using the results from riello & patat ( 2005 ) we can guess the approximate size of an error in @xmath282 by imagining it was determined from galaxy - based simulations and in so doing we have mis - estimated the relative importance of the bulge to the total luminosity in late - type galaxies .",
    "the dotted lines show that a 30% error in this ratio ( and thus reducing or augmenting the scale length by a factor of 1.5 ) results in a @xmath270.03 mag bias . in practice ( i.e. , for cosmological applications )",
    "a net bias would only result from unaccounted for differences in @xmath282 between high and low redshift such as may result from evolution or sample selection .",
    "interestingly , we also find that the effect of taking a so - called `` weak '' prior , that @xmath292 is constant for @xmath293 , and zero for @xmath294 is a worse choice , resulting in a bias of 0.07 mag .",
    "the reason is that the mean of such a prior is unnaturally large , biasing the extinction estimate in that direction . likewise , assuming negligible extinction will result in an underestimate , equal to the mean of the true distribution ( which , for an exponential , is the value of the scale length itself ) .",
    "the lesson is intuitively clear , when using a prior it is important to take the best estimate ( and estimate a systematic error from the range of good guesses ) as a seemingly `` conservative '' or `` weak '' version can be worse .     mag ) with different priors , varying the prior scale length .",
    "the dotted lines highlight the results of using the correct prior ( @xmath288 mag , no bias ) and priors with @xmath282 larger or smaller by a factor of 1.5 .",
    "this plausible range of variation ( particularly in comparing different sn samples ) could lead to a bias of @xmath270.03 mag .",
    "[ fig - app3],width=576 ]    for a specific sn sample it is probably best to simulate the sources and sizes of uncertainty depending on the data quality before determining whether the use of an extinction prior offers more to gain than to lose .",
    "our simulations reveal nothing that intuition does not : a good measurement is better than a bad prior , and a good prior will improve imperfect measurements .",
