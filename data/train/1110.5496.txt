    "the growth of patterns in forced thin liquid films on solid substrates is an ubiquitous process of both biological and technological relevance which has attracted the attention of the scientific community over the last decades @xcite .",
    "the manipulation of thin films is important in microfluidics , where the increasing miniaturization of fluidic devices demands the development of new and simple ways to handle small volumes of liquid . due to their smaller internal hydrodynamic resistance and increased surface area ,",
    "thin films can be used to overcome problems associated to other geometries , such as microchannels  @xcite .",
    "both experimental and theoretical studies indicate the possibility of using clever structuring of microfluidic devices to orient the growth of films @xcite or to control the motion of interfaces in confined microfluidic chambers @xcite .",
    "still , a remaining challenge is how to control the intrinsic growth of thin liquid films in the microscale .",
    "when a thin film of liquid is forced to spread on a dry solid substrate , there is a net accumulation of fluid close to the contact line , which corresponds to the apparent position where the liquid , the solid , and the surrounding gas meet . as a result , the film profile bulges near its leading edge , generating a capillary ridge . for films driven by a body force , such as a constant pressure gradient",
    ", variations in the size of the ridge along the leading edge of the film have the effect of increasing the hydrostatic pressure locally .",
    "this introduces a driving mechanism that amplifies small perturbations to the contact line , which are relaxed by the surface tension @xcite .",
    "such competition of driving and restoring forces gives rise to a linear instability @xcite , which , far from a flat advancing front , leads to the formation of non - linear structures , such as the familiar water rivulets observed in the shower .",
    "given the strong interaction with the solid , it is unsurprising that the instability is affected by the wetting properties of the liquid @xcite .",
    "wetting interactions determine the equilibrium contact angle of the fluid - fluid interface with the solid . as a consequence ,",
    "the size and shape of the capillary ridge , which control the driving destabilizing force , depend on wetting . for hydrophilic substrates ,",
    "the contact angle of the interface profile is small , making the capillary ridge relatively thin .",
    "the instability is thus weakened @xcite .",
    "remarkably , if the size of the ridge is sufficiently small , the restoring capillary pressure is strong enough to balance the driving force after the early stages of growth .",
    "the interface thus stops growing , but still retains a curved saturated shape reminiscent of a sawtooth pattern @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for hydrophobic substrates the net accumulation of mass at the ridge is large enough to outweigh the effect of surface tension , and the emerging film patterns grow steadily , with a shape that resembles that of fingers @xcite .",
    "crucially , the lateral lengthscale of the patterns , @xmath0 , is of the order of the thickness of the thin film .",
    "therefore , in a microfluidic device one expects that the lengthscale of emerging patterns is also of the order of microns .",
    "our aim in this paper is to demonstrate the exploitation substrate heterogeneity to control the growth of the contact line , up to complete growth saturation .",
    "this is appealing to many situations in which fingering is undesirable , for example in coating processes and in ` chemical channeling ' @xcite , where the desired lateral lengthscale of the film needs not to be constrained by the intrinsic lengthscale of the instability .",
    "we shall thus analyze the effect of a simple , yet effective , substrate pattern that consists of hydrophilic - hydrophobic stripes oriented transversely to the direction of flow , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] . as we shall see below",
    ", the lengthscale of the micropattern is important , and has a significant impact already at scales comparable to the micron - sized films .",
    "still , and despite its simplicity , such a pattern has not yet been studied . in a previous study @xcite , we have demonstrated that the growth of the thin film can be tuned by patterning the solid substrate with transverse or checkerboard arrangements of hydrophilic - hydrophobic domains .",
    "previous experimental and numerical studies of flow patterning @xcite have mainly focused on the effect longitudinal tracks of varying flow resistance @xcite or wetting angle @xcite .",
    "the overall experiments and numerical simulations evidence is that substrate heterogeneity can be used to handle thin films , through preferential orientation over hydrophilic or low - resistance domains in the substrate , or to partially control its growth using checkerboard hydrophilic - hydrophobic patterns .",
    "as we shall show in the following , the proposed transverse pattern introduces new physical mechanisms , particularly the transverse spreading of the film , which lead to the desired saturation of the contact line .    our approach to this problem will be to perform lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) simulations @xcite of navier - stokes hydrodynamics coupled to a phase - field binary fluid model @xcite to account for the interface dynamics . previous theoretical approaches to model forced thin films on chemically heterogeneous substrates have mainly consisted of sharp - interface formulations based on the stokes equations @xcite .",
    "most of these studies use the so - called thin - film equations , which are appropriate to model the fluid dynamics in the limit of small interface slopes . within this framework ,",
    "a common procedure to regularize the viscous dissipation singularity is to replace the contact line by a thin precursor film that extends beyond the leading front .",
    "the effect of the heterogeneity can then be included by choosing a particular model for the precursor .",
    "for example , an heterogeneous disjoining pressure model that couples to the precursor film @xcite has been used to study the motion of the film on longitudinal - striped and disordered substrates , as well as on ordered and disordered isolated spots @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a similar model consisting of a spatially - varying thickness of the precursor film to study the motion of the film over chemical patterns has also been used @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to study the effect of a sharp contrast between hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains in the proposed micropatterns .",
    "this corresponds to situations in which the static and dynamic contact angles need not to be small .",
    "such regime falls beyond the limit of applicability of the thin - film equations , demanding the resolution of the full three - dimensional dynamics .",
    "this is a complicated problem from the classical point of view , as it involves the motion of two free boundaries : the film surface and the contact line . within sharp - interface formulations ,",
    "boundary integral methods could be used to address this problem , as has been done to model the effect of chemical heterogeneities on two - dimensional fluid nanodrops @xcite .",
    "however , the mesoscopic approach that we take here constitutes a reliable three - dimensional navier - stokes solver that allows for both small and large contact angles , necessary to model hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions . because of the diffuse approximation to describe the fluid interface",
    ", the method circumvents the free - boundary problem , regularizes the viscous dissipation singularity at the contact line , and deals naturally with merging and pinch - off events , which otherwise need a specific rule in sharp interface approximations .",
    "we have carried out a validation of our model in a previous study , for the case of driven thin films on homogeneous solid substrates @xcite .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the mesoscopic model and the lattice - boltzmann algorithm to perform the numerical simulations .",
    "we will complement our numerical results with kinematical calculations for the propagation of the interface . as we shall see from our numerical results , presented in section  [ sec : results ] ,",
    "the main effect of the transverse hydrophilic stripes on the forced film is to favor its lateral spreading on hydrophilic domains , thus slowing down the leading edge of the film .",
    "the same lateral spreading ultimately leads to a speed - up of the trailing edge of the film .",
    "the net result is that the growth rate of the film decreases with increasing fraction of hydrophilic stripes in the substrate , until the film saturates above a critical value of this fraction .",
    "as we detail in the discussion and conclusions of this work , presented in section  [ sec : dc ] , we predict that a relatively small fraction of hydrophilic stripes is sufficient to suppress the growth of the contact line in experimental realizations .",
    "our results thus constitute a promising step towards the control of interface growth in microfluidic systems .",
    "in this paper we shall perform numerical simulation of navier - stokes level hydrodynamics coupled to a phase - field representation of the viscous fluid film and surrounding low - viscosity phase .",
    "such modeling is very useful to address the dynamics of immiscible fluids , as it has the advantage of circumventing the free - boundary problem associated to sharp - interface representations , as for example in boundary integral methods .",
    "furthermore , the phase - field model regularizes the viscous dissipation singularity at the contact line through a diffusive mechanism acting at small scales ( of the order of the size of the interface ) .",
    "one thus does not need to specify additional boundary conditions at the contact line . in order to integrate the model equations , we will use a lattice - boltzmann algorithm .",
    "is forced along the @xmath1 direction by the action of a constant body force , @xmath2 , on a solid substrate composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic transverse stripes .",
    "the scale of the thin film thickness and of the width of the stripes is of the order of microns .",

    "the mechanism that causes such a saturation originates from transverse spreading of the leading edge of the contact line on the hydrophilic domains and from the growth of the film at the hydrophilic - hydrophobic boundary so as to reach the advancing contact angle .",

    "the air - water pair closely reproduces the viscosity contrast used in the simulations .",
    "our simulations show that the instability is effectively suppressed using a sharp contrast in the wetting properties between the domains forming the micropattern .",
    "for example , a front moving over a polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) substrate would have a relatively large contact angle ( @xmath242 ) , where fingers are expected to develop @xcite . in that case , the low - wetting angle domains could be formed using glass ( @xmath243 ) or a gold coating ( @xmath244 ) @xcite .",

    "such body forces are of the order of the gravitational force density for water and can be accomplished by simple column devices and accurately controlled by syringe pumps . from our simulation measurements we estimate the leading and trailing edge velocities of steady finger propagating at the imposed speed on a hydrophobic substrate , @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "our prediction shows that the film will saturate at a different fraction of hydrophilic coverage depending on the width of the hydrophilic stripes , @xmath142 , which determines the fraction of lateral spreading , @xmath161 .",
    "a sensible choice is to set @xmath142 to the order of magnitude of the lengthscale of the instability , @xmath251 .",

    "the previous example shows the experimental feasibility of the mechanisms proposed in this work for a regular liquid under typical conditions found in microfluidics .",
    "however , the fact that the relevant lengths scale with the film thickness ( expressed here by the choice of units to report our results ) indicates that a proper up- or down - scaling of the system size and the applied forcing can provide a substantial flexibility to induce analogous phenomena in different liquid / gas or liquid / liquid mixtures at scales below the capillary length .",
    "this opens the possibility of a better control of the fingering instability in controlled environments by substrate heterogeneity .",
