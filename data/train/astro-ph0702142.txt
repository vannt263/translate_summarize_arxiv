    "the orbits of binary systems evolve with time due to orbital angular momentum changes .",
    "this change of orbital angular momentum can happen due to mass loss from the system , mass transfer within the system and tidal interactions between the components .",
    "x - ray binary pulsars are suitable candidates to study such orbital evolution because of the following reasons .",
    "firstly , in all these systems the normal companion star is transferring matter to the compact star either through wind capture or through roche - lobe overflow .",
    "secondly , the strong gravitational pull of the compact object raises tides on the companion star which tend to circularize and synchronize the binary orbit .",
    "this causes orbital angular momentum changes which result in the change of orbital period .",
    "thirdly , pulse timing analysis allows us to obtain an orbital ephemeris history with an accuracy upto a few seconds .",
    "thus monitoring x - ray binary pulsars over a time span of a few decades allows us to measure the rate of change of the orbital period . for most x - ray binaries",
    "the orbital ephemeris clearly deviates from the linear trend .",
    "including a quadratic term improves the fit in several cases ( cen x-3 , nagase et al .",

    "1998 ) indicating a non - vanishing orbital period derivative .",
    "the many x - ray satellite missions have thus made it possible to measure the rate of change of the orbital period , showing that for high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) the orbital evolution time scales are of the order of a million years .",
    "the x - rays emitted from the compact object in hmxbs and subsequently reprocessed in the stellar wind can be used to probe the stellar wind of the massive companion , a supergiant or a be star .",
    "an investigation of the x - ray spectrum from the compact object at different orbital phases can give useful insight into the morphology of the stellar wind .",
    "the absorbing column density in the line of sight would vary with orbital phase and is a function of the mass - loss rate , stellar wind velocity and acceleration method and also depends on any anisotropy in the stellar wind structure .",
    "moreover , a binary system with an elliptical orbit would be a better candidate in this type of study since it would have a larger variation of the parameters that determine the column density at different orbital phases .",
    "if the compact object is a pulsar , the orbit can often be determined precisely , which is an added advantage .",
    "orbital phase resolved spectroscopy was carried out recently on some hmxb pulsars like x 1908 + 075 ( levine et al .",
    "2004 ) and gx 3012 ( mukherjee and paul 2004 ) and very different results were obtained .",
    "4u  153852 is an x - ray pulsar , first detected with the uhuru satellite ( giacconi et al .",
    "regular x - ray pulsations with a period of 529 s were later discovered with ariel 5 and oso-8 observations by davison et al .",
    "in addition , the oso-8 observations revealed a clear orbital modulation of the pulsation period and also showed good evidence for an eclipse lasting 0.6 day recurring with a period of 3.75 days .",

    "there were twenty - five observations , each corresponding to one orbit of the satellite .",
    "each observation was of 1.56.0 ks duration .",
    "for spectral analysis , we also used an archival observation from rxte spanning from 1997 - 01 - 01 to 1997 - 01 - 05 , having fourteen satellite orbit data .",

    "there were forty segments in this observation ; one for each satellite orbit , with an exposure of 1.74.0 ks .",
    "the motivation for using the bepposax observations is to have a better spectral coverage since the lower values of column densities are measured more accurately with bepposax , which has a good response at low energies .",
    "rxte consists of a large - area proportional counter array ( pca ) , with five xenon proportional counter units ( pcus ) and sensitive in the energy range of 260 kev with an effective area of 6250 cm@xmath2 ( jahoda et al .",

    "asm long term light curve of 4u  153852 folded at the orbital period is shown in figure 1 which clearly shows the eclipse with a slow ingress and a sharp egress .",
    "the bepposax observatory has a set of narrow field instruments ( nfi ) comprising one low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ; 0.110 kev , 22 cm@xmath2 @ 0.28 kev ) , three medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs ; 1.310 kev , 150 cm@xmath2 @ 6 kev ) , one high pressure gas scintillator proportional counter ( hpgspc ; 4120 kev , 240 cm@xmath2 @ 30 kev ) , and a phoswich detection system ( pds ; 15300 kev , 600 cm@xmath2 @ 80 kev ) .",
    "a detailed description of bepposax can be found in boella et al .",
    "only the 2003 rxte - pca data were used for a timing analysis .",
    "the light curve was extracted from event mode data with time resolution of 0.125 s. only photons detected in the top two layers were used .",
    "the photon arrival times were then corrected to the solar system barycenter .",
    "figure 2 . shows the complete barycentered light curve for the august 2003 observation with rxte - pca .",
    "the light curve shows variability at time scales other than the regular 526.85 s pulses from the neutron star .",
    "the pulsed emission is strong enough for individual pulses to be seen in the energy range from 1 kev to 40 kev .",
    "the pulse profile is double peaked with a main pulse and an inter pulse which is about half the amplitude of the main pulse .",
    "the average pulse period of the source was obtained by pulse folding and @xmath12 maximisation method .",
    "the light curve was then folded with the average spin period derived to get pulse profiles at different orbital phases .",
    "each pulse profile is an average of two successive pulses binned into 256 pulse phase bins .",
    "a total of fortysix such pulse profiles were generated , spanned over two binary orbits of 4u  153852 .",
    "to get the arrival times of these pulses , we decomposed each pulse profile into 128 fourier components .",
    "the phase of the first fourier component which also has the highest amplitude was used to find the arrival time delay of the respective pulses .",
    "figure 3a shows the arrival time delay curve .",
    "the arrival time delay curve when fitted with a circular orbital delay curve ( i.e. @xmath13 ) leaves out systematic residues as shown in figure 3b indicating an elliptical orbit .",
    "subsequently , we fitted the pulse arrival time delay with a function appropriate for elliptical orbit given below .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 it was seen that the errors in the individual measurements of pulse arrival times were greater than the error due to photon counting statistics , possibly due to some aperiodic intensity variation over a range of time scales . while fitting the arrival delay curve to an elliptical binary orbit , the statistical uncertainties on the arrival time measurements were multiplied by a constant factor to obtain a reduced @xmath18 value of 1.0 .",
    "this method was employed so that one can compare the orbital parameter estimations with the earlier measurements ( clark 2000 ) . for a circular orbit ,",
    "the rescaled uncertainties gives a best fit with a @xmath18 value of 64 for 43 degrees of freedom . comparing this with the reduced @xmath18 value of 1 for an elliptical orbit",
    "as described above , we reconfirm an elliptical orbit for this system .",
    "the value of the five free parameters for an elliptical fit , namely @xmath19 , @xmath20 , e , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are listed in table 1 .",
    "we combined the new epoch measured from the rxte data taken in 2003 with the earlier measurements listed in clark ( 2000 ) .",
    "the mid - eclipse times derived from light curves obtained using the uhuru and arial v were not included because the x - ray eclipse is asymmetric as seen in the folded asm light curve of figure 1 . as the x - ray source goes into eclipse gradually and",
    "comes out of the eclipse rather sharply , the mid - eclipse time determined from the light curve only is likely to be inaccurate and have some systematic errors . fitting the remaining 9 mid - eclipse times with a linear function",
    "gives a reduced @xmath23 of 1.3 for 7 degrees of freedom .",
    "the residuals from a linear fit to the mid - eclipse times are shown in figure 4 .",
    "a quadratic fit improves the reduced @xmath23 by a mere 0.01 ( for 6 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "if the mid - eclipse time record is fitted with an orbital evolution corresponding to the value reported in clark ( 2000 ) , a reduced @xmath23 of 2.5 is obtained , which is larger than the same for a linear fit .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that there is no evidence for an orbital evolution in 4u  153852 from the available data .",
    "for the rxte data , we took the standard 2 data products of pca and extracted the source spectra for each dataset using the tool saextrct v 4.2d for the appropriate good time intervals .",
    "background data files were generated with the tool runpcabackest using background models appropriate for the source brightness and the epoch of the rxte observation , as provided by the pca calibration team .",
    "the background subtracted source spectra were analyzed with the spectral analysis package xspec v 11.2.0 ( shafer , haberl @xmath24 arnaud 1989 ) .",
    "model spectra were convolved with the detector response matrix and fitted to the observed pulse phase averaged spectrum in the spectral range of 320 kev and the important spectral parameters were determined .",

    "all the parameters were kept free in the 2003 dataset while for the 1997 dataset , the line centre energy and the width were kept frozen at 6.4 kev and 0.01 kev respectively .",
    "the source and background spectra of bepposax were extracted from the mecs and lecs detectors using circular regions of radius 4@xmath25 and 8@xmath25 respectively .",
    "the energy range chosen for mecs was ( 1.810.0 ) kev while that for lecs was ( 0.34.5 ) kev , in which the respective instruments have large effective area and the spectral responses are well understood .",
    "for all the three observations , the mecs and lecs phase averaged out - of - eclipse spectra were fitted simultaneously with the relative normalization of the two instruments allowed to vary .",
    "all the spectra were suitably binned to allow use of @xmath12 statistics .",
    "both the mecs and lecs data of bepposax were simultaneously fitted using xspec v 11.2.0 . due to the restricted energy range ( 1.810.0 kev )",
    ", no high energy cutoff was required .",
    "the out of eclipse pulse phase averaged spectrum was first fitted with a simple model comprising of a powerlaw and a gaussian line alongwith the photoelectric absorption using morrison and mccammon cross - sections .",
    "the values of the line centre energy and line width as obtained in this fit were then kept frozen to fit spectra at different orbital phases .    the rxte - pca and the bepposax spectra were all well fitted with a relatively simple model .",
    "robba et al .",
    "( 2001 ) had detected marginal evidence of a soft excess at @xmath0 1 kev which was resolved by modeling the spectrum with one additional component , either as a black - body of temperature 0.08 kev or a bremsstrahlung of temperature 0.1 kev .",
    "we also found that the inclusion of a soft black - body component in the phase averaged out - of - eclipse spectrum from bepposax marginally improves the fit .",
    "however , for orbital phase resolved spectroscopy , we have not included a soft component as it lies outside the range of the rxte spectrum and in the orbital phase resolved spectrum with bepposax , it will be too faint to constrain . in total , there were seventy nine spectra to be fitted and with the above mentioned model , they gave reasonable reduced @xmath12 values in the range of 0.8 to 1.5 for rxte ( with 27 dof ) , and 0.6 to 1.3 for bepposax ( with 63 dof ) .",
    "representative spectra , one each from the rxte - pca and bepposax are shown in figures 5 & 6 respectively . the rxte - pca spectra analysed here also does not include the energy range of the cyclotron absorption feature .",
    "the spectral parameters obtained from the fitting of the three datasets used in our analysis were investigated for their variation against the orbital phase of the pulsar .",
    "the photon index of the power law is seen to remain more or less constant over the binary phase having values between 1.0 to 1.5 . the fluorescent iron - line flux measured with the average spectrum taken over 2000 - 3000 s ,",
    "also does not show any considerable variation along the orbit .",
    "the cut - off energy measured with rxte - pca has a value @xmath0 14 kev and the e - folding energy is @xmath0 7 kev .",
    "these are slightly different from the values of the cut - off energy ( @xmath0 16 kev ) and e - folding energy ( @xmath0 10 kev ) measured with bepposax in a broad energy band ( robba et al .",
    "we detected a notable variation in the equivalent hydrogen column density with orbital phase as shown in figure 7 .",
    "it shows a smooth variation over orbital phase , increasing gradually by an order of magnitude as the pulsar approaches eclipse ( mid - eclipse is defined by phase zero ) . at orbital phases",
    "far from the eclipse , the column density has a value of @xmath0 1.5 @xmath9 10@xmath26 h atoms @xmath27 . in figures 1 , 5 , 6 , & 7 ,",
    "the orbital phase is measured with respect to the mid - eclipse time .",
    "a pulse period of 526.85 s of the pulsar 4u  153852 determined from rxte - pca observation in 2003 shows that the spin - up trend of 4u  153852 first detected with batse during the 1990s has continued since then . the overall spin - up time scale ( @xmath28 ) during the five years of batse observation reported by rubin et al .",
    "( 1997 ) was 9.6 @xmath9 10@xmath29 s@xmath7 .",

    "2001 ) and again with rxte ( 2003 , present work ) is 1.4 , 1.2 and 7.4 @xmath9 10@xmath30 s@xmath7 , significantly larger than the average spin - up rate during the batse era .",
    "an increase in spin - up rate is expected if the overall x - ray luminosity had increased after the batse observations .",
    "however , it is very impractical to compare the pulsed hard x - ray flux measured by batse and the total x - ray flux measurements with the later instruments in a different energy band .",
    "the value of @xmath31 that we obtained from pulse timing of the rxte - pca data in 2003 is 53.1 @xmath32 1.5 lt - s , which is consistent with the batse result and slightly smaller than that obtained from the 1997 rxte data .",
    "we note here that the accuracy of orbital parameter determination in slow pulsars like 4u  153852 is considerably poorer than in fast pulsars like smc x-1 , her x-1 etc . in analysis of the batse data ,",
    "rubin et al . (",
    "1997 ) considered a circular orbit whereas analysing pulse arrival times from two complete binary orbits we found the orbit of 4u  153852 to be eccentric with e = 0.18 @xmath32 0.01 .",
    "our result is consistent with the results obtained from a 1997 observation of this source with the rxte - pca ( clark 2000 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath21 determined from the 2003 observation is smaller compared to that found by clark from the 1997 observation .",
    "if the difference is due to apsidal motion then the rate of apsidal motion is @xmath33 yr@xmath7 .",
    "we found no significant evidence for orbital evolution in the system as reported from earlier measurements ( clark 2000 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath34 determined from all the available mid - eclipse times is @xmath35 yr@xmath7 .",
    "combining the pulse timing results on 4u  153852 obtained from our observation with the earlier reported measurements , we are able to rule out an orbital decay in this system for which clark ( 2000 ) found marginal evidence . the new upper limit presented here on possible changes of the orbital period of 4u  153852 supersedes previous limits considerably .",
    "tidal interaction between the two stars and mass loss from the companion star are the two main effects that cause orbital decay in the hmxb systems .",
    "the orbital evolution of several hmxb pulsar systems ( cen x-3 , smc x-1 and lmc x-4 ) is very well documented .",
    "the companion star mass , and the size of the binary orbit in 4u  153852 is very similar to the above mentioned binaries , and therefore , the tidal effect that is expected in 4u  153852 should be as strong as in the three other hmxbs . in the present work ,",
    "we find no clear evidence of an orbital decay in 4u  153852 . if at all , the system shows a positive orbital period derivative , like the enigmatic system cyg x-3 ( singh et al .",
    "this indicates that mass loss may play a prominent role in the evolution of this system .",
    "tidal interaction between the neutron star and the companion in close hmxbs should also circularise the orbit .",
    "the orbits of most of the close ( orbital period less than 4 days ) hmxbs are highly circularised with eccentricity less than 0.006 .",
    "but the orbit of 4u  153852 is not yet circularised and shows no orbital decay .",
    "therefore , it is likely that 4u  153852 is a relatively young system compared to the other hmxbs . using the mass , radius and luminosity of the companion star qv nor from the optical observation ( reynolds et al . 1992 )",
    "the approximate time for tidal circularisation of this system works out to be @xmath36 yrs ( lecar , wheeler & mckee,1976 ) . since the system is still eccentric , it is possible that the age of the system after the supernova explosion is of the order of a few thousand years ; very small compared to the lifetime of hmxbs .",
    "the eccentricity derived using the two rxte observations in 1997 ( clark 2000 ) and 2003 ( reported here ) is likely to be correct for two reasons .",
    "the rxte - pca has a large effective area compared to the earlier missions and in the energy range of pca more photons are detected compared to cgro - batse using which rubin et al ( 1997 ) did not detect any eccentricity . if the eccentricity is high , then either the binary system is young or the circularisation time is actually much longer than a few thousand years estimated using lecar s method ( 1976 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a binary is unlikely to become very x - ray active by wind accretion within just a few thousand years of the supernova explosion .",
    "it is possible that the circularisation mechanism works very efficiently in systems with roche - lobe overflow like lmc x-4 while accretion mechanism in 4u 153852 is likely to be driven by stellar wind .",
    "lack of any substantial variation in the photon index , the cut - off energy , and the e - folding energy over the binary phase of 4u  153852 suggests that the continuum x - ray spectrum of the pulsar is hardly affected during its revolution along the orbit .",
    "this indicates a nearly constant accretion rate and identical conditions in the accretion column throughout the binary orbit . in the hmxb pulsar",
    "gx 301 - 2 , orbital phase resolved spectroscopy with rxte - pca showed that the spectral parameters remain almost constant throughout the orbit though the overall accretion rate and wind density , and clumpiness of the wind changes considerably with the binary phase ( mukherjee and paul 2004 ) . on the other hand , in 4u  153852",
    "the equivalent hydrogen column density shows a smooth variation over the orbital phase .",
    "we compare the observed column density profile with a model estimated by assuming a spherically symmetric castor , abbott & klein ( cak 1975 ) wind from the companion star .",
    "the velocity profile of the wind is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the terminal velocity for the stellar wind , r@xmath39 is the radius of the companion and r is the radial distance from centre of the companion star .",
    "the column density profiles were derived using a numerical integration along the line of sight from the pulsar to the observer for three different inclination angles 65@xmath40 , 75@xmath40 and 85@xmath40 respectively . in figure 7",
    "we show the equivalent hydrogen column density measured with bepposax and rxte - pca as a function of the orbital phase with respect to the mid - eclipse time . a mass - loss rate of @xmath010@xmath5 m@xmath41 yr@xmath7 and v@xmath42 @xmath01000 km s@xmath7 were assumed .",
    "the model calculations of the absorption column density for different inclination angles when superposed on the observed values indicate reasonable agreement as can be seen in figure 7 .",
    "this indicates that a spherically symmetric stellar wind from the companion star may produce the observed orbital dependence of the column density for certain range of the orbital inclination .",
    "we note here that the we have not done any fitting of the column density measurements and the model column density values at different orbital phases ( figure 7 ) . for the wind density model used here ,",
    "the phase resolved column density values depend on the mass loss rate , the terminal velocity and the inclination angle of the binary orbit .",
    "the data presented here is not suitable for such a detailed analysis but only shows that such a model is consistent with the observations . in eclipsing x - ray binaries like 4u 153852",
    ", the eclipse duration puts strong constraints on the orbital inclination .",
    "we point out that the orbital phase resolved column density measurements can be an independent way of estimating the orbital inclination , especially for non - eclipsing x - ray binaries .",
    "we also note that in several eclipsing and wind - fed hmxbs , the eclipse ingress is more gradual than the eclipse egress ( haberl et al .",
    "1989 , feldmeier et al .",
    "1996 , naik & paul 2004 ) . from the rxte - asm light curves of many eclipsing hmxb pulsars",
    "we have verified that this effect is more pronounced at lower energies .",
    "this ingress - egress asymmetry , which varies in degree from source to source is partly due to absorption by accretion material trailing the x - ray source in its orbit .",
    "for example , vela x-1 ( feldmeier et al . 1996 ) has a much larger ingress - egress asymmetry and lmc x-4 ( naik & paul 2004 ) has a much smallter asymmetry compared to 4u 153852 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we think that the slight asymmetric accretion column distribution in the case of 4u 1538 - 52 on two sides of the eclipse ( figure 7 ) can also partly be due to some trailing accreting material .    in several other hmxbs like 4u  170037 ( haberl et al . 1989 ) , 4u  1907 + 09 ( roberts et al .",
    "2001 ) and gx 3012 ( leahy 1991 , pravdo & ghosh 2001 , with rxte ) , it has been shown that a simple spherical wind emanating from the companion star is not sufficient to explain the column density profile .",
    "density enhancement due to a trailing stream or a disk from the companion arising due to the dynamical effects of the pulsar was invoked to explain the said profile . in the case of gx 3012 , detailed observations with rxte - pca revealed that neither a disk nor a stream was sufficient to explain the observed profile ( mukherjee and paul 2004 ) . considering the results for these hmxbs , the present work seems to carry an interesting implication .",
    "clark , woo and nagase ( 1994 ) have studied the column density variation during eclipse egress for this particular source with ginga data .",
    "two hmxb pulsars in which similar increase in absorption column density pattern was seen near eclipse are x1908 + 075 ( levine et al .",
    "2004 ) and smc x-1 ( woo et al .",
    "1995 ) which also may have isotropic wind pattern from the companion stars . in the present study we investigated the out - of - eclipse variation of the column density and found that a simple model with a spherically symmetric stellar wind describes the observations well .",
    "since 4u  153852 has a moderate x - ray luminosity ( @xmath0 10@xmath43 erg s@xmath7 ) , it is not expected to cause any significant perturbation in the acceleration of the stellar wind through x - ray ionization as compared to high luminosity sources like cen x-3 ( day & stevens 1993 ) and smc x-1 ( woo et al .",
    "1995 ) with luminosities of @xmath0 10@xmath44 erg s@xmath7 in the high states .",
    "observation of 4u  153852 covering the eclipse ingress and egress with high throughput telescope like xmm - newton and suzaku which also have good low energy response will allow one to carry out a detailed study of the stellar wind structure in this source and also determine the extent to which the local x - ray photoionisation affects the stellar wind acceleration .",

    "<S> we report here results from detailed timing and spectral studies of the high mass x - ray binary pulsar 4u  153852 over several binary periods using observations made with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) and bepposax satellites . </S>",
    "<S> pulse timing analysis with the 2003 rxte data over two binary orbits confirms an eccentric orbit of the system . combining the orbitial parameters determined from this observation with the earlier measurements we did not find any evidence of orbital decay in this x - ray binary . </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out orbital phase resolved spectroscopy to measure changes in the spectral parameters with orbital phase , particularly the absorption column density and the iron line flux . </S>",
    "<S> the rxte - pca spectra in the 320 kev energy range were fitted with a power law and a high energy cut - off alongwith a gaussian line at @xmath0 6.4 kev , whereas the bepposax spectra needed only a power law and gaussian emission line at @xmath0 6.4 kev in the restricted energy range of 0.310.0 kev . </S>",
    "<S> an absorption along the line of sight was included for both the rxte and bepposax data . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the free spectral parameters over the binary orbit was investigated and we found that the variation of the column density of absorbing material in the line of sight with orbital phase is in reasonable agreement with a simple model of a spherically symmetric stellar wind from the companion star . + * keywords : * stars : binaries : eclipsing , stars : pulsars : individual : 4u 1538 - 52 , x - rays : stars    @xmath1tata institute of fundamental research , + homi bhabha road , colaba , mumbai 400 005 , india +   + @xmath2joint astronomy program , indian institute of science , + bangalore-560 012 , india +   + @xmath3institute of space and astronautical science , + 3 - 1 - 1 yoshinodai , sagamihara , + kanagawa 229 8510 , japan +   + @xmath4nuclear research laboratory , + bhabha atomic research centre , + mumbai-400 085 , india +   + </S>"
