    "early space based observations with the iras satellite identified four bright , nearby stars with strong ir excesses : @xmath5 pic , vega , fomalhaut , and @xmath0 eri @xcite .",
    "the only reasonable explanation for these excesses is that the systems contain substantial dust , which is warmed by starlight until it radiates brightly in the ir because of the large total surface area of its numerous small grains ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the dust in these systems can not be primordial but must be continually generated by the grinding down of larger bodies such as asteroids @xcite .",
    "the stars are therefore said to have ` debris disks ' .",
    "the clear implication is that each of these stars has at least an asteroid belt , and probably a more extensive planetary system , because it is unlikely that an asteroid belt would form without planets also forming , or that it would continue to grind down without ongoing gravitational stirring due to planets .",
    "theoretical models ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) predict that it should be possible to make direct images of giant planets orbiting nearby , young stars , using the current generation of large ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics ( ao ) .",
    "these observations are only possible at near infrared wavelengths from about 1 - 5 @xmath2 m , where giant planets are self - luminous due to the gravitational energy converted to internal heat in their formation and subsequent slow contraction . because giant planets radiate this energy away over time , they become cooler and fainter as they age .",
    "the youngest nearby stars are therefore the most promising targets for ao surveys attempting to image self - luminous giant planets .",
    "each of the four debris - disk stars discovered using iras is relatively young , so orbiting giant planets might be detectable if any exist .",
    "we have imaged the two stars most easily observable from northern hemisphere sites : vega and @xmath0 eridani .",
    "vega s age is about 0.3 gyr @xcite , while the age of @xmath0 eri is about 0.56 gyr @xcite . besides the dust - dispersion timescale argument mentioned above for the existence of planetary systems around these stars , asymmetries in the dust distributions around each have led to hypotheses that the dust is being gravitationally sculpted by giant planets orbiting at large distances @xcite . in the case of vega",
    "there are suggestions that the dust may reveal the mass and approximate position of a giant planet @xcite . for @xmath0 eridani , in addition to evidence for a planet in a distant orbit that may be sculpting the dust @xcite",
    ", there is the the radial velocity and astrometric detection of the closer - in planet @xmath0 eri b @xcite .",
    "the combination of radial velocity and astrometry observations permits a full orbital solution yielding ephemerides for the separation and position angle of @xmath0 eri b @xcite , making this the most promising case yet where attempts to image a known extrasolar planet can target a specific location .",
    "most imaging searches for extrasolar planets to date have used either the @xmath4 band ( 1.5 - 1.8 @xmath2 m ) or other filters in the same wavelength regime ( see for example @xcite ) . the magnitude vs. mass tables of @xcite and the theoretical spectra of @xcite show clearly why the @xmath4 band is usually chosen : giant planets are predicted to be very bright at these wavelengths , much brighter than black bodies at their effective temperatures .",
    "detector formats are large , technology well developed , and sky backgrounds faint at the @xmath4 band relative to longer wavelengths .",
    "however , theoretical models indicate that planet / star flux ratios are much more favorable at the longer wavelength @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands ( 3.4 - 4.1 @xmath2 m and 4.5 - 5.0 @xmath2 m , respectively ) . for planets at sufficiently large separations , or planets orbiting faint stars , the planet / star flux ratio is not relevant .",
    "rather , it is the planet s brightness relative to the sky background and/or detector read noise that matters . in this regime",
    "the very high sky background in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands prevents them from being as sensitive as the @xmath4 band regime .",
    "however , close to very bright stars the background becomes irrelevant and only the planet / star flux ratio matters . under these circumstances using the longer wavelengths makes sense .",
    "vega is a magnitude 0.0 standard star and is among the brightest stars in the sky at almost any wavelength .",
    "@xmath0 eri , while not impressive at visible wavelengths , is a very bright magnitude 1.9 at @xmath4 band .",
    "the stars are therefore excellent targets for clio , an @xmath1 and @xmath3 band optimized ao camera that had its first light on the mmt in june 2005 @xcite .",
    "we have made deep @xmath61 hour integrations in both the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands on both stars .",
    "our @xmath3-band observations are the deepest ground - based images yet published in this band .",
    "in section [ obs ] we present our observations and data analysis strategy . in section [ sensanal ] , we describe our methods of analyzing our sensitivity , and present our sensitivity results .",
    "blind sensitivity tests in which simulated planet images were inserted directly into the raw data show that we have obtained 100% completeness for sources at 10@xmath7 signficance , 77% completeness for 7@xmath7 sources , and 41% completeness for 5@xmath7 sources , where @xmath7 is an estimate of the rms noise amplitude in the image at the spatial scale of the psf core ( the relevant scale for detection of faint point sources ) .",
    "we note that no other planet - imaging papers to date present such careful blind tests in their sensitivity analyses , and that the fact that our tests result in somewhat lower completeness values at each significance level than might have been expected suggests such tests should always be attempted and may result in a need to revise some sensitivity estimates to more conservative values .    in section [ vega ]",
    "we compare the sensitivity we have obtained around vega to that of other deep observations of vega , and to the expected brightness of planets that have been hypothesized to explain the dust distribution . in section [ eri ]",
    ", we present the same comparisons for @xmath0 eri , and in section [ conclusion ] we present the conclusions of our study .",
    "the clio instrument we used for our observations has been well described elsewhere ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "we present only a brief overview here .",
    "the mmt ao system delivers a lower thermal background than other ao systems because it uses the world s first deformable secondary mirror , thereby avoiding the multiple warm - mirror reflections ( each adding to the thermal background ) that are needed in ao systems where the deformable mirror is not the secondary .",
    "this unique property makes the mmt ideal for ao observations in wavelengths such as the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands that are strongly affected by thermal glow .",
    "clio was developed to take advantage of this to search for planets in these bands .",
    "it saw first light as a simple imager offering f/20 and f/35 modes .",
    "the design allowed for coronagrapic capability , which has since been developed @xcite but was not fully operational at the time of our vega and @xmath0 eri observations . in the f/20 mode we used for all the observations of vega and @xmath0 eri , clio s field of view",
    "is 15.5@xmath812.4 arcseconds .",
    "its plate scale is @xmath9 arcseconds per pixel , which gives finer than nyquist sampling of the diffraction - limited psf of the mmt in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "we carry out @xmath1 and @xmath3 band imaging with clio using the technique of nod - subtraction , in which we take images of our target star in two different telescope positions offset typically by about 5.5 arcsec , and then subtract the images taken in one position from those taken in the other to remove artifacts from the bright sky background and detector imperfections .",
    "since the star is present on images taken in both positions , both provide useful science data .",
    "nod - subtraction does result in a dark negative image of the star reducing the sensitivity in part of each image , but the area affected is fractionally small , far ( 5.5 arcsec ) from the star , where planets are less likely to be found , and can be placed away from objects of potential interest by a good choice of the nod direction .",
    "we also have alternative ways of processing nodded data that do away with the dark images entirely .",
    "we typically nod the telescope every 2 - 5 minutes , which appears to be fast enough that variations in the sky background are sampled well enough to be essentially removed .",
    "we take 5 or 10 images in each nod position , each of which typically represents about 20 seconds worth of data . a full data set consists of 100 - 500 such images .",
    "we choose the exposure for most of the images so that the sky background level is about 70% of the detector full - well . at such exposure times",
    "the cores of bright stars such as vega and @xmath0 eri are saturated , but optimal sensitivity is obtained to faint point sources beyond the saturation radii .",
    "when possible , we interleave a few nod cycles of shorter exposures yielding unsaturated star images into the sequence of longer exposure images .",
    "this allows us to measure the unsaturated psf under the exact conditions of a particular observing sequence .",
    "we achieved the psf measurement with @xmath0 eri , but vega proved too bright for us reasonably to obtain unsaturated images .",
    "we used other stars observed close in time to our vega observations to provide a reference psf for the vega data .",
    "tables [ tab : vobs01 ] and [ tab : vobs02 ] give details of our observations .",
    "the june 2006 @xmath3 band vega observations had far higher sky noise than the april 2006 data , possibly because of the higher thermal background during warm summer weather , and therefore were not used in calculating the final sensitivity .",

    "we briefly state that our baseline processing involves dark subtraction ; flat fielding ; nod subtraction ; several iterations of different types of deviant ( ` hot ' ) pixel removal ; a pattern noise correction ( figure [ fig : tileim ] panel b shows an example image at this stage ) ; shifting , rotation , and zeropadding in a single bicubic spline operation ; final stacking ; and then unsharp masking of the stacked image using a gaussian kernel 3 - 4 times wider than the psf .",
    "for the final image stacks we use a creeping mean algorithm with 20% rejection .",
    "this algorithm works by finding the mean of all values for a given pixel , rejecting the most deviant one , finding the new mean , rejecting the new maximally deviant value , etc , until the specified rejection fraction is reached . for data sets where ghosts or other artifacts can render a large fraction of the data at a given location deviant , the creeping mean produces a cleaner final stack than the median .",
    "figure [ fig : tileim ] panel a shows an example of a raw image ; panel b shows a partially processed version of the same image just before shifting and rotation ; and panels c and d show examples of final stacked images after unsharp masking .",
    "in addition to the image made using our baseline processing , we make images using two types of more advanced processing , one that avoids the negative star images from standard nod subtraction at the cost of slightly increased noise , and one that includes subtraction of the stellar psf using a technique similar to the angular differential imaging ( adi ) described by @xcite .",
    "we use all three images when we search for companions , since the detection of a faint companion on images processed in more than one way increases the likelihood that it is real .",
    "we also construct a separate sensitivity map for each of the three differently - processed master images , and then combine them into a single master sensitivity map . since the different processing methods obtain optimal sensitivity at different locations , we set the sensitivity at a given location on the master map to the best sensitivity obtained at that location on any of the three separate maps .",
    "details on how the separate sensitivity maps themselves are made may be found in section [ sensanal ] .",
    "intensive image processing such as we describe here is often used for ao planet search data , where high contrast is required and artifacts must be aggressively removed .",
    "such processing can remove flux from the faint point sources whose detection it is intended to facilitate .",
    "careful tests of our processing methods , however , indicate that the flux loss from a faint psf is no more than about 10% , and appears to be close to zero in most cases .",
    "to test the accuracy of our sensitivity estimator , we conducted blind tests in which fake planets were inserted into the raw data .",
    "the altered images were then processed in exactly the same way as the original raw data , and the ` planets ' were detected using both automatic and manual methods by an experimenter who knew neither their positions nor their number .",
    "these planets were inserted at fixed nominal significance levels of 10@xmath7 , 7@xmath7 , and 5@xmath7 based on the sensitivity map .",
    "we conducted such tests for each of our four data sets ( the @xmath1 and @xmath3 band data sets for each of the two stars ) .",
    "the final result of each test was that every inserted planet was classified as ` confirmed ' , ` noticed ' , or ` unnoticed ' .",
    "` confirmed ' means the source was confidently detected and would certainly be worthy of long - exposure followup observations at the mmt .",
    "if a source is detected with this confidence level in an unaltered data set , there is no significant doubt it is a real object . in calculating our completeness , we count only confirmed sources as true detections . `",
    "noticed ' means the source was flagged by our automatic detection algorithm , or noticed as a possible real object during the purely manual phase of planet - searching , but could not be confirmed beyond reasonable doubt .",
    "many spurious sources are ` noticed ' whereas the false - positive rate for ` confirmed ' detections is extremely low , with none for any of the data sets discussed here . ` unnoticed ' means a fake planet was not automatically flagged or noticed manually .",
    "the end result of the four blind sensitivity tests was that at 10@xmath7 , 50 of 50 total inserted planets were confirmed , giving us 100% completeness to the limits of the statistical accuracy of the test . at 7@xmath7 , 23 of 30 total inserted sources",
    "were confirmed , giving us 77% completeness , and 29 of the 30 sources were at least noticed . at 5@xmath7 ,",
    "11 of 27 total inserted planets were confirmed , for 41% completeness , and 23 of the 27 sources were at least noticed .",
    "in addition to the completeness levels for confirmed sources , the percentages of fake planets that were at least noticed is of potential interest for setting limits : 100% of 10@xmath7 sources , 97% of 7@xmath7 sources , and 85% of 5@xmath7 sources were at least noticed",
    ". we note that if we had quoted 5@xmath7 sensitivities without conducting a blind sensitivity test we would have significantly overestimated our true high - completeness sensitivity .",
    "most papers in the field of planet - imaging surveys do in fact quote 5@xmath7 limits , and do not verify their validity by a blind test .    in our sensitivity experiments there were no false positives among the ` confirmed ' sources .",
    "many spurious sources were classified as ` noticed ' , which is why we do not count ` noticed ' sources as detections for completeness purposes .",
    "the conclusion of our fake planet experiments is that our detection strategy has an extremely low false alarm probability , and delivers the completeness values given above .",
    "the fact that a large majority of low significance sources were noticed , even if not confirmed , indicates that upper limits stronger than those implied by our formal completeness values may be set on planets in clean regions of an image where no spurious sources were noticed .",
    "we have converted the master sensitivity maps described above into magnitude contour images , with 10@xmath7 sensitivity values shown .",
    "we quote sensitivities in apparent magnitudes based on observations of photometric standard stars ( from @xcite ) , rather than giving @xmath16-magnitudes relative to the primary .",
    "we present our @xmath1 and @xmath3 band vega results in figures [ fig : vegamap ] and [ fig : vegammap ] , with the approximate position of the hypothetical planet from @xcite marked with a white ` x ' .",
    "figures [ fig : erilmap ] and [ fig : erimmap ] present the analogous results for @xmath0 eri .",
    "our vega @xmath3 band observation is the deepest ground - based @xmath3 band observation yet published .",
    "we have further translated our master sensitivity map for each data set into 10@xmath7 sensitivity curves , and plotted them in figures [ fig : vegal_mag ] through [ fig : erim_mass ] .",
    "our sensitivity varies azimuthally as well as radially due to the negative nod subtraction images , ghosts , and the different distances to the edge of the valid data region in different directions .",
    "therefore we have computed both the 50th and 90th percentile sensitivities at each radius .",
    "both are shown , with the 50th percentile , of course , indicating our median sensitivity and the 90th percentile indicating our sensitivity in the cleanest 10 % of the image at a given radius from the star .",
    "we have also indicated the ` confirmed ' , ` noticed ' , and ` unnoticed ' planets from our sensitivity tests with appropriate symbols .",
    "the sensitivity in these plots increases with separation from the star as one would expect , but then decreases again as the edge of the good data region ( ie , useful field on the master stacked images ) is reached .",
    "the noise goes up at the edge of the useful field because , due to the shifts and rotations required to register the images , the coverage ( number of images supplying data to a given pixel ) goes down near the edge of the field .",
    "figures [ fig : vegal_mag ] and [ fig : vegal_mass ] show the sensitivity we obtained in our @xmath1 observations of vega , first in ` observational ' units of sensitivity in magnitudes vs. separation in arcsec , and then in ` physical ' units of mj ( based on the @xcite models , and adopting an 0.3 gyr age for vega @xcite ) vs. projected separation in au .",
    "vega has approximately magnitude 0.0 at every band , so the magnitudes in figure [ fig : vegal_mag ] correspond approximately to @xmath16-magnitude values .",
    "figures [ fig : vegam_mag ] and [ fig : vegam_mass ] show the sensitivity obtained in our @xmath3 band observations of vega , following exactly the same conventions as the @xmath1 figures that precede them .",
    "comparison of [ fig : vegal_mass ] and [ fig : vegam_mass ] shows that the @xmath1 and @xmath3 band results provided similar sensitivity to planets around vega .",
    "the @xmath3 band results are slightly better , especially at smaller separations .",
    "this is not surprising , because the predicted planet / star flux ratio is even more favorable at @xmath3 band than at @xmath1 . also , mmtao , like all ao systems , delivers better strehl ratios at longer wavelengths , so the psf subtraction is more effective at @xmath3 band than at @xmath1",
    ".    figures [ fig : eril_mag ] through [ fig : erim_mass ] show the sensitivity of our @xmath1 and @xmath3 band observations of @xmath0 eri , following the same conventions as the vega figures that precede them . for @xmath0 eri",
    "we have adopted an age of 0.56 gyr @xcite .",
    "note that the magnitudes in figures [ fig : eril_mag ] and [ fig : erim_mag ] may be converted to @xmath16-magnitudes by subtracting the @xmath1 magnitude of @xmath0 eri , which is about 1.72 ( the @xmath1 - @xmath3 color of the star is near zero ) .",
    "comparing figure [ fig : eril_mass ] with [ fig : erim_mass ] shows that for @xmath0 eri the advantage of the @xmath3 band over @xmath1 is considerably more than for vega .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that @xmath0 eri is closer to us than vega .",
    "this is an important point we will refer back to later : the smaller the distance to a star system , the more favorably long wavelength planet search observations of the system will compare to short wavelength ones .",
    "there are several logical links in the explaination of this observational fact .",
    "first , intrinsically low - luminosity planets can be detected only in the nearest systems .",
    "second , low - luminosity planets have low @xmath17 .",
    "third , low @xmath17 planets have red @xmath18 colors . therefore , the faintest detectable planets will be more red in nearby systems than in distant ones , and it follows that longer wavelength observations ( i.e. , @xmath3 band ) will perform best relative to shorter wavelength ones ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) on the very nearest stars .",
    "this conclusion is most obvious when one considers background - limited regions of images at large separations from the star , but it applies in the contrast limited regime as well .",
    "we have not attempted to compare our vega results with an exhaustive list of all previous attempts to image planets or other faint objects around vega . instead , we have chosen two of the best previous results .",
    "first , the @xmath4 band imaging results of @xcite , and second , the narrow band , @xmath4-regime images of @xcite .",
    "the latter presents the most sensitive images yet published for substellar companions at 3 - 10 arcsecond separations from vega .    before comparing our sensitivities with these other observations",
    "a brief discussion about the different sensitivity estimation techniques used by the respective observers is in order .",
    "as described above , in this work we have used an estimator able to account for correlated noise , we have performed blind tests of our sensitivity estimator , and we have quoted 10@xmath7 limits .",
    "@xcite did not calculate sensitivity limits in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "instead , they calculated their sensitivities by performing numerous tests in which they placed 4 planets into their data at a fixed separation and @xmath16-magnitude with respect to the primary .",
    "these tests differ from our own blind sensitivity tests in that the locations of the @xcite fake planets were known , and fixed from one test to the next .",
    "@xcite set their sensitivity at each separation to the faintest @xmath16-magnitude at which at least 3 of the 4 planets were recovered by their automatic detection algorithm .",
    "therefore the @xcite sensitivities correspond to planet brightness values at which they had at least 75% completeness , with an unknown false - positive rate .",
    "although it appears the completeness level corresponding to the @xcite sensitivities corresponds better to our 7@xmath7 level , we have conservatively chosen to compare the @xcite sensitivity values to our own 10@xmath7 results without alteration .",
    "@xcite do not explain how their quoted 5@xmath7 sensitivity limits are obtained .",
    "we assume , however , that they used the same method as @xcite , another planet imaging survey by a very similar set of authors , presenting observations made with the same telescope , instrument , and observing and analysis stategies .",
    "@xcite set @xmath7 limits using a sensitivity estimator carefully designed to account for correlated noise .",
    "they also carefully account for processing losses , but they do not present blind sensitivity tests . assuming that @xcite used the same good estimator and careful correction of processing losses , we conservatively choose to consider their quoted 5@xmath7 limits to be comparable with our 7@xmath7 limits . based on this assumption we transform them to 10@xmath7 limits for comparison with out own .",
    "we also adjust their limits by a factor of 2 ( 0.753 mag ) in the direction of greater sensitivity , to scale from the planet - optimized narrowband filter they used to the broadband @xmath4 filter .",
    "( @xcite estimate this correction at a factor between 1.5 and 2.5 ; we have used the mean value of 2.0 . )",
    "figure [ fig : vhbur ] shows the sensitivities of our vega @xmath1 and @xmath3 band observations compared to those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnitude limits , adjusted as described above , have been converted to planet masses using the theoretical planet models of @xcite , adopting the @xcite age of 0.3 gyr .",
    "we plot our 90th percentile 10@xmath7 sensitivity values because the 90th percentile curves are smoother and easier to interpret , and because sensitivity at least this good can be obtained at a position angle of choice by a well - tuned observing strategy . although our observations are more sensitive to planetary - mass objects around vega than the observations of @xcite , the carefully processed narrowband observations of @xcite are more sensitive than ours by 1.5 - 3 mj at all separations beyond 3 arcseconds , which was their approximate saturation radius . inward of 3 arcsec",
    "our images are sensitive mainly to brown dwarfs and and the most massive planets , while the other plotted observations are saturated or very insensitive .",
    "however , in the regime of higher masses and smaller separations than covered by our figure , we note that lyot project @xmath4 band observations of vega @xcite obtain sensitivity to massive brown dwarfs inward to about 0.7 arcsec .",
    "their observations appear to be sensitive to lower mass brown dwarfs than ours inside of 1.5 arcsec , while ours are more sensitive at 2 arcsec and farther out .",
    "it is interesting to note that the figure [ fig : vhbur ] would look very different if we plotted @xmath16-mag rather than minimum detectable planet mass .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath4 regime results of @xcite would surpass the sensitivity of our observations by a far greater margin in @xmath16-mag terms . at the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands",
    "the sky background is far brighter than in the @xmath4 regime .",
    "also , diffraction limited resolution is several times lower , and the airy pattern is correspondingly larger in angular terms .",
    "the result is that despite the cleaner , higher strehl images offered by ao systems at longer wavelengths , the @xmath16-mag vs. angular separation curves at @xmath1 and @xmath3 band are typically considerably less good than those in the @xmath4 regime .",
    "because the planet / star flux ratios are so much better in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands , however , when we convert from @xmath16-magnitudes to planet masses the sensitivity gap closes considerably , and in fact ( as will be seen below in the case of @xmath0 eri ) the longer wavelengths may turn out to be more sensitive .    in terms of planet mass",
    "the @xcite @xmath4-band regime observations were more sensitive than our @xmath1 and @xmath3 band results beyond 3 arcseconds , but not by a huge margin .",
    "theoretical planet models are still somewhat uncertain because of the dearth of observational constraints . @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath3 band observations of bright stars such as vega make sense to diversify the investment of planet - imaging effort and hedge the overall results against the possibility that unexpected atmospheric chemistry , clouds , or evolutionary effects ( see for example @xcite ) cause planets to appear fainter in @xmath4 band than current models predict .",
    "it is also possible that planets could be fainter than predicted at the longer wavelengths , specifically @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , the supression of @xmath3 band flux observed by @xcite applied only to objects with @xmath17 from 700 - 1300 k. the situation for objects cooler than 700 k is unknown . according to the @xcite models , our vega @xmath3 band observations were sensitive to planets with @xmath17 below 400",
    "k. such objects may be too cold to have the enhanced concentrations of @xmath19 to which @xcite attributed the @xmath3 band flux supression ( see @xcite ) .    because they offer better flux ratios relative to the primary star than shorter wavelengths , the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands we have used are optimal for detecting massive planets and low mass brown dwarfs at small separations from vega and other very bright stars .",
    "@xcite presents high - resolution submillimeter observations of vega which show two bright clumps arranged asymmetrically relative to the star .",
    "he states that is very unlikely the clumps could be background galaxies , and is essentially certain that they are concentrations of dust in the vega system .",
    "further , the dust could represent the remains of two different planetesimal collisions in the system , but the collisions would have to have happened fairly recently or the dust would have dispersed . @xcite therefore concludes the most reasonable assumption is that the clumps are dust concentrations resulting from resonant interactions between the dust and a massive planet .",
    "he shows that the observations could be explained by a 3 mj planet in a large , eccentric orbit , which would currently be near apastron and located about 7.1 arcsec nw of the star ( though the submillimeter observations were carried out a few years before our imaging , a planet near apastron in such a large orbit would not move appreciably over that interval ) .",
    "we chose the target position and nod direction for our vega observations to obtain good sensitivity at the location of this hypothetical planet .",
    "the planet s location is marked on our sensitivity contour plots ( figures [ fig : vegamap ] and [ fig : vegammap ] ) .",
    "we do not detect the planet , so our observations place upper limits on its mass .    at an approximate separation of 7.1 arcsec ,",
    "pa 315 degrees ( due nw ) , our @xmath1 images of vega give a 10@xmath7 sensitivity of @xmath1 = 15.21 , or a 7@xmath7 sensitivity of @xmath1 = 15.60 .",
    "translating these magnitudes to masses using the @xcite models for an age of 0.3 gyr , and using the results of our blind sensitivity tests , we can rule out a planet at this location with a mass above 6.02 mj with near 100% confidence , and one more massive than 4.30 mj with 77% confidence .",
    "if the images were very clean at this location , showing no suspected sources , we could set stronger limits .",
    "however , there was a suspected source within about 0.4 arcsec of this location .",
    "careful records of the manual examination of the images make it clear that the suspected source can be identified as spurious with high confidence , and should by no means be considered a candidate detection of the @xcite planet .",
    "its appearence simply means the images are not very clean at this location , and the stronger limits possible in regions without suspected sources do not apply .    at the same location on our @xmath3 band images , we obtained 10 , 7 , and 5@xmath7 limits of @xmath3 = 13.39 , @xmath3 = 13.78 , and @xmath3 = 14.14 , respectively . using the @xcite models for an age of 0.3 gyr , these magnitude limits correspond to planets of 5.14 mj , 3.76 mj , and 2.86 mj , respectively .",
    "records from our automatic and manual examination of the images show no suspected source within 1.5 arcseconds of this location .",
    "since in the sensitivity tests 97% of 7@xmath7 planets and 85% of 5@xmath7 planets were at least suspected , we can rule out a planet above 3.76 mj at this location at the 97% confidence level , and one above 2.86 mj at the 85% confidence level .",
    "the excellent sensitivity obtained at this location is due in part to the fact that our observing strategy was optimized to give good sensitivity near the position of the @xcite hypothetical planet .",
    "we can set limits on the hypothetical planet of @xcite close to , or perhaps even below , the proposed mass of 3 mj .",
    "it would appear from figure [ fig : vhbur ] that @xcite set similar or slightly lower limits , though the exact sensitivity of their observations at the position angle of the @xcite planet can not be explicitly analyzed because they present their sensitivity only in a radially averaged sense .",
    "observations at the @xmath4 and @xmath3 bands have thus consistently set upper limits near the predicted mass of 3 mj .",
    "a 3 mj planet at the 0.3 gyr age we have adopted for vega would have @xmath17 between 300 and 400 k. no objects in this temperature range have yet been observed , so model fluxes are not observationally constrained at any wavelength .",
    "where an upper limit from a single band would be tentative because of the uncertainties of the models , the consistent results from a range of wavelengths allow us to conclude that it is probable no 3 mj planet exists at this location .",
    "@xcite makes it clear that other models besides his hypothetical 3 mj planet might explain the observed dust distribution , and that further modeling is needed to see what range of planetary orbits and masses might be capable of producing the resonant dust concentrations seen in the submillimeter .",
    "@xcite , for example , explain the distribution of dust they observe around vega at 350 - 450 @xmath2 m wavelengths ( vs 850 @xmath2 m for @xcite ) by a neptune - mass planet in a 65 au orbit .",
    "it is not entirely clear whether their model also explains the @xcite images ; however , @xcite presents a model of a migrating neptune - mass planet that does match the 850 @xmath2 m images .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , @xcite present a model that explains the 850 @xmath2 m images by a 3 mj planet in a considerably larger orbit than that suggested by @xcite .",
    "it would have the same current pa as the @xcite planet ( nw of the star , near pa @xmath20 ) , but it would be 12 - 13 arcsec from vega as opposed to 7 arcsec .",
    "our clio observations do not obtain good sensitivity at these larger separations , though new , differently targeted clio images could .",
    "no current observational technique can image neptune - mass extrasolar planets in distant orbits .",
    "the non - detections of our survey and that of @xcite lend some support to models explaining the vega dust distribution using such planets rather than the model of @xcite in which the planet has a mass a few times that of jupiter . however , we can not rule out a 3 mj planet in the more distant orbit suggested by @xcite , simply because our observing strategy was not designed to give good sensitivity at such a large separation .",
    "theoretical planet models indicate that observations at @xmath1 , @xmath3 band , and the narrowband @xmath4-regime filter of @xcite can detect planets down to 3 mj in the vega system .",
    "further work at all three bands would either detect such a planet or rule out the existence of one at large separation with very high confidence .",
    "consistent results at a variety of wavelengths will ensure that conclusions are less vulnerable to model uncertainties at any particular wavelength .",
    "more submillimeter work and orbital modeling of the vega system is also desirable , because if models explaining the dust distribution without a massive planet can be ruled out , deep targeted ao observations to detect the planet could be strongly prioritized , and success could be anticipated with confidence .",
    "as with vega we do not attempt to compare our @xmath0 eri results with an exhaustive list of other studies , but only with a few that obtained the best sensitivity results .",
    "we have chosen @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : ehbur ] shows the results of the comparison , with again , the 90th percentile 10@xmath7 sensitivity curves for our observations plotted .    of the other studies , the sensitivity methods of @xcite",
    "have already been discussed in section [ vega ] above , as have those of @xcite because we assumed @xcite used the same methods for their vega data .",
    "it only remains to consider the methods of @xcite .",
    "they use a sensitivity estimator which is based on the single - pixel rms in 6 pixel ( 0.05 arcsec , or 1.2 @xmath21 ) square boxes on the images , and they quote 5@xmath7 limits .",
    "it is not clear whether they take processing losses into account in their sensitivity calculation . in general",
    "we expect sensitivity estimators involving the single - pixel rms to overestimate the sensitivity , as they assume independence of noise in adjacent pixels .",
    "this assumption is always violated in the speckle - dominated regions on ao images ( that is , speckle noise is always spatially correlated , though the extent of the correlation depends on the details of the raw images and the type of psf subtraction used ) .",
    "the above would seem to imply that the @xcite 5@xmath7 sensitivity results are comparable to our 5@xmath7 limits , and that we should adjust them by a factor of 2 ( 0.753 mag ) toward decreased sensitivity in order to compare them properly against our 10@xmath7 limits .",
    "this would not include any correction for the possible overestimation of sensitivity in the presence of correlated noise .",
    "however , several characteristics of the @xcite data suggest their sensitivity should be rated higher than this .",
    "first , they use a ` roll subtraction ' technique which effectively creates both a positive and a negative image of any real companion , separated by @xmath22 of rotation about the primary star , and the presence of both can be used to evaluate the reality of potential sources .",
    "this doubles the data and the sensitivity should accordingly go up by @xmath23 .",
    "second , their simultaneous differential imaging ( sdi ) technique involves two independent spectral differences .",
    "they are not necessarily equally sensitive , but in the best case this again doubles the data available for planet detection . with , potentially , four equal - brightness images of any real object in their data ( two independent spectral difference images at each of two ` roll angles ' )",
    ", the sensitivity of the @xcite observations should in principle go up by a factor of as much as 2 ( i.e. @xmath24 ) over their nominal values .",
    "finally , beth biller has explained to us that the @xcite 5@xmath7 point - source sensitivities were calculated by comparing the single - pixel rms noise to the brightness of the peak pixel of a psf .",
    "this method is conservative for well - sampled data such as that of @xcite , since it does not take into account the fact that bright pixels surrounding the peak of a psf allow it to be detected with additional confidence .",
    "the single - pixel method also does not overestimate the sensitivity in the presence of correlated noise ( provided the rms noise is calculated over a large enough region ) .",
    "the above might indicate we should compare the @xcite nominal 5@xmath7 sensitivities directly to our 10@xmath7 sensitivities ( since obtaining 4 separate images of any real source could in principle raise the sensitivity to twice its nominal value ) .",
    "however , since the two spectral difference images do not neccesarily have equal sensitivity , we have scaled the @xcite nominal 5@xmath7 limits down in sensitivity by about a factor of @xmath23 ( 0.38 mag ) to compare them with our 10@xmath7 limits .",
    "this is equivalent to taking into account the @xcite sensitivity gain only from the fact that an image is obtained in each of two ` roll angles ' , and not from the additional fact that at each roll angle two independent spectral difference images are produced .",
    "the reader should keep this in mind when examining figure [ fig : ehbur ] : we may have underestimated the relative sensitivity of the @xcite obsevations by a factor of around @xmath23 ( 0.38 mag ) .",
    "this rather small correction would not affect our conclusions .    as with the @xcite vega data ( and also the @xcite @xmath0 eri data )",
    ", we have adjusted the @xcite sensitivities toward greater sensitivity to convert magnitudes from narrowband filters tuned to a predicted peak in giant planet spectra to broadband @xmath4 magnitudes . for @xcite ,",
    "the correction factor we applied was 0.84 magnitudes .",
    "this is an approximate value based on the sdi observers analysis of their own filters .",
    "figure [ fig : ehbur ] makes it clear that though the best @xmath4-regime results for vega delivered better sensitivity than our @xmath1 and @xmath3 band observations , the sensitivity of our @xmath3 band observation of @xmath0 eri is better than that of all previous observations out to a separation of at least 7 arcseconds from the star . within three arcseconds of the star",
    "the sensitivity advantage of the longer wavelength observation is especially great .",
    "we note that this applies only to our @xmath3 band result : the sdi method of @xcite , which is designed to give excellent sensitivity close to bright stars , does give results comparable those of our @xmath1 observation .",
    "the good performance of the @xmath3 band is due to the fact that the planet / star flux ratio is much more favorable at @xmath3 band than even in the most optimized intervals of the @xmath4 band .    in closing this section on comparitive sensitivities",
    ", we note that although we have used mainly the theoretical planet models of @xcite to calculate sensitivities in this work , those presented in @xcite are a good complement and comparison to the former",
    ". however , the filter set over which @xcite integrated their theoretical spectra is slightly different from the clio filter set , over which we integrated the @xcite models .",
    "we have , however , also done tests in which we performed magnitude - mass conversions using the original mass / mag / age tables presented in @xcite . in general , the @xcite models give us somewhat better sensitivity in @xmath1 than those of @xcite , with a typical disagreement of 1 - 2 mj .",
    "the @xmath3 band predictions of the two model sets are very close . at present",
    "we can not say for sure if the @xmath1 band discrepancy is inherent in the different models or is a pure artifact of the filter set . in any case",
    "the two model sets are broadly in agreement , except for very old , cool planets , where the differences become very large and it appears clear that slightly different filter sets can not be the whole explanation ( see the discussion of the @xmath4 band flux of @xmath0 eri b below ) .",
    "@xmath0 eri has the extremely important distinction of being one of only a few stars around which a single planet has been detected with both rv and astrometric methods @xcite .",
    "this means that a complete , unique solution for the size , eccentricity , and orientation of the orbit is possible , as is a solution for the mass of the planet . @xcite",
    "present such an orbit solution , and give the mass of the planet as 1.55 mj .    at the time of our observations",
    "the @xcite orbit predicts a separation of about 0.684 arcsec .",
    "our observations do not set limits in the planetary mass regime this close to the star .",
    "we note , however , that our observations were not timed with the idea of obtaining good sensitivity to this planet .",
    "if we had observed the planet near its apastron , at which point the separation is about 1.7 arcsec , our @xmath3 band observations in particular would have been in the range to set possibly interesting limits , though still above the @xcite mass of 1.55 mj .",
    "the median 10 and 7@xmath7 sensitivities of our @xmath3 band observation at 1.7 arcseconds are 5.3 and 4.2 mj , respectively , and our 5@xmath7 limit is 3.9 mj .",
    "these are good sensitivities at a very small separation from a bright star , but , of course , the planet would still not have been detected , unless it is far more massive than the @xcite orbital solution indicates .",
    "could any current - technology telescope detect this planet , and if so what would be the best method ?",
    "@xcite applied the same sdi methodology used by @xcite to observe @xmath0 eri at several different epochs .",
    "the data from their second epoch gave them the best limit on the planet , with a 3@xmath7 sensitivity of @xmath16-magnitude 13.1 at the expected location of the planet based on @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , the @xcite observations using the sdi method had two independent roll angles and two independent spectral differences for each observation , and the sensitivity estimation method they used was conservative . assuming",
    "that @xcite used the same methodology , we will compare their 3@xmath7 limits directly to our 10@xmath7 limits .",
    "note that even considering all the issues mentioned in section [ compsens ] above this results in a conservative estimation of our sensitivities relative to those of @xcite .",
    "we can adjust the @xcite 3@xmath7 sensitivity of @xmath16-magnitude 13.1 by the 0.84 mag value used before and add the @xmath4 = 1.88 magnitude of the star itself to get an equivalent sensitivity of @xmath4 = 15.8 ; the equivalent masses are 9.6 and 9.1 mj according to the @xcite and @xcite models , respectively , with the age set to 0.56 gyr in both cases .",
    "however , @xcite mention that the correction from the narrowband sdi filters to @xmath4 band would actually be much greater than 0.84 magnitudes for a very cool object such as @xmath0 eri b. according to their figure 5 , the correction is about 2.2 magnitudes for the appropriate filter difference at our adopted age of 0.56 gyr for @xmath0 eri .",
    "this different correction does not change the upper limit of 9.6 mj quoted above , because the larger correction applies only to a planet with the 1.55 mj mass determined by @xcite , which would have been far too faint for @xcite to detect .",
    "however , the 2.2 magnitude correction is appropriate for estimating by what factor the @xcite observations missed the planet  that is , how much their sensitivity would have to be increased in order to detect it .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xcite observations in their narrowband filter was about 13.1 + 1.88 = 14.98 mag , assuming that the magnitude of @xmath0 eri a is the same in the narrowband filter as in broadband @xmath4 .",
    "according to the models of @xcite , an 0.56 gyr - old planet of mass 1.55 mj located 3.27 pc away has an @xmath4 band magnitude of about 28.5 .",
    "we subtract the 2.2 magnitude correction to obtain a narrowband magnitude of 26.3 , and difference the result with the @xcite sensitivity of 14.98 mag .",
    "the conclusion is that the @xcite sensitivity was insufficient to detect the planet by 11.3 magnitudes ( a factor of 34,000 ) under the @xcite models . as noted in section [ compsens ] above",
    ", the @xcite models disagree with the @xcite ones on the brightness of @xmath0 eri b : the former indicate that the @xcite miss factor is only about 1000 , rather than 34,000 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear . it does not affect our conclusions about the best band at which to search for",
    "@xmath0 eri b. the large discrepancy for two model sets that are in close agreement for warmer objects does suggest that theoretical @xmath4 band magnitudes for objects with temperatures as low as @xmath0 eri b have a large uncertainty , and therefore any constraints based on them will be tentative .",
    "the @xmath3 band brightnesses predicted by the two model sets for @xmath0 eri b are discrepant by a much smaller factor , about 1.7 rather than 34 ( see below ) .",
    "the miss factors calculated above indicate the sdi sensitivity would have to be increased at least a thousandfold to detect the planet .",
    "assuming we had observed the planet at apastron , by what factor would we have failed to detect it ?",
    "we will consider only our @xmath3 band results , as they are more sensitive than our @xmath1 observations to low mass planets close to the star .",
    "our median 10@xmath7 sensitivity at the apastron separation of 1.7 arcsec was @xmath3 = 12.02 .",
    "the models of @xcite give the brightness of the planet as @xmath3 = 14.7 .",
    "this means we would have come short of a 10@xmath7 detection by 2.68 mag , or a factor of 11.8 , according to the @xcite models ( the @xcite models give a higher but not enormously discrepant miss factor of 20.5 ; as in the paper up to this point we focus on the @xcite models in the discussion that follows ) .",
    "our blind sensitivity tests indicate about 40% completeness at 5@xmath7 , with 85% of sources at least noticed .",
    "thus if we could increase our sensitivity by only a factor of 5.9 ( that is , 11.8 divided by 2 to change from 10 to 5@xmath7 ) , we would have some chance of confidently detecting the planet , with a greater likelihood of at least noticing it .",
    "these lower miss factors suggest that @xmath0 eri b might actually be detectable near apastron with ground based @xmath3 band imaging .",
    "it is almost certain that @xmath0 eri b is at too low a @xmath17 for its @xmath3 band flux to be dimmed by the above - lte @xmath19 concentrations suggested by @xcite and @xcite to account for the supressed @xmath3 band flux observed for much hotter objects ( see @xcite for an analysis of how the effects of non - equilibrium @xmath19 concentrations diminish with decreasing @xmath17 ) .",
    "we note also that even if the supression of @xmath3 band flux remained , @xmath3 would still be better for the detection than the @xmath4-regime .",
    "the next apastron of @xmath0 eri b is in 2010 , and this would be the best time to attempt to image it with a very deep @xmath3 band observation . we have observed that our sensitivity in both speckle - limited and background - limited regimes increases roughly as the square root of the integration time , as we would expect .",
    "therefore , barring further improvements in clio or mmtao , an exposure 35 ( or @xmath25 ) times as long as our @xmath3 band integration would be required to have a 40% chance of making a confirmed detection of the planet using clio at the mmt .",
    "this means 35 hours of observing , or about seven good nights .",
    "improvements to the clio instrument , mmtao , and our processing methods might bring the detection in range with a shorter exposure , perhaps only two nights .",
    "we note that at 1.7 arcseconds from @xmath0 eri our current images are speckle - limited  the background limit is still a factor of about 3 lower .",
    "alterations to the instrument , or improved psf subtraction methods in post - processing , may in future obtain near - background limited performance at this separation .",
    "the planet might then be detectable with only one or two nights worth of integration , though four to six nights would still be preferred to ensure that an interesting upper limit could be set in the event of a non - detection .",
    "clio has already been used with a phase plate coronagraph @xcite which improves the close - in sensitivity .",
    "as far as we know clio , when used with the adaptive secondary ao system of the mmt , is the only currently operating ao imager able to make the deep , high - efficiency integrations in the broad @xmath3 band required to detect @xmath0 eri b. other ao imagers exist that can use the @xmath26 band , where the narrower bandpass reduces the intensity of the thermal background .",
    "however at @xmath26 the sensitivity to planets is also reduced and the project becomes unfeasible . given a multi - night @xmath3 band integration with clio , the goal of obtaining the first direct image of a mature extrasolar planet appears to be within reach .",
    "detection and characterization of @xmath0 eri b should be quite straightforward with new large telescopes such as the lbt ( which might be used instead of the mmt to make the first detection ) , gmt , tmt , or e - elt , provided the latter two are equipped with the adaptive secondary ao systems necessary to reduce thermal background and make deep @xmath3 band observations feasible .",
    "space - based observations are likely to be useful as well .",
    "the planet might be studied at @xmath1 , @xmath3 band , or longer wavelengths using jwst , or it could be detected in reflected light at visible wavelengths by a sensitive space - based coronagraph .",
    "however , the first detection may come well ahead of jwst and the next generation of giant telescopes  it may be achieved in the @xmath3 band with the mmt during the 2010 apastron .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that the dust disk of @xmath0 eri has been sculpted by a planet of 0.1 - 0.2 mj in an orbit between 40 and 65 au in radius .",
    "@xcite agree , and prefer the model of @xcite .",
    "such a planet would be far too faint to detect with any telescope in the near future .",
    "however , @xcite state that an additional , @xmath6 1 mj planet in a closer - in orbit is likely required to produce the observed clearing of the dust inside of about 30 au @xcite .",
    "the rv / astrometric planet of @xcite and @xcite has too small an orbit to account for this dust clearing ; @xcite suggest a larger orbital radius between 10 and 18 au for the planet responsible for clearing the dust . @xcite",
    "mention a long - term trend in rv measurements for @xmath0 eri a that might indicate just such a planet : a @xmath6 1 mj object orbiting with a period longer than 50 years .",
    "since such a planet would probably appear at least 3 - 4 arcsec from the star , we would likely have detected it if it had a mass of 4 - 5 mj or greater , as would the @xcite observation .",
    "since the mass is expected to be closer to 1 mj , it is not surprising the planet has not yet been detected .",
    "it might be imaged serendipitously in the course of a very long exposure intended to detect the known rv / astrometric planet .",
    "we have taken very deep @xmath1 and @xmath3 band images of the interesting debris disk stars vega and @xmath0 eri to search each system for orbiting planets and brown dwarfs .",
    "for both stars we obtained better sensitivity than shorter - wavelength observations at small separations from the star . the sensitivity of our observations compared more favorably to the sensitivity of @xmath4-regime observations in the case of @xmath0 eri than in the case of vega . for @xmath0 eri , our @xmath3 band observation appears to set the best upper limits yet for planets out to a separation of about 7 arcseconds , beyond which the sensitivity of the @xcite @xmath4-regime observations becomes very slightly superior .",
    "the reason our @xmath0 eri observations have a greater sensitivity advantage over @xmath4 regime observations than do our images of vega is the smaller distance to the @xmath0 eri system .",
    "this is another instance of the same physical reality we discussed in section [ finsens ] above , when explaining why our @xmath3 band sensitivity is much better than our @xmath1 results on @xmath0 eri but not on vega . as we stated above , for @xmath0 eri",
    ", the sensitivity of a given observation at any wavelength extends down to less luminous , lower @xmath17 planets than for vega .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 colors , as well as the @xmath18 color , of low @xmath17 giant planets are more red than those of hotter ones",
    ". therefore the faintest detectable objects in the @xmath0 eri system would be more red than those in the more distant vega system , and longer wavelength observations are most useful for the nearer system .",
    "this is a general and important principle for planning optimal planet search strategies : the faintest detectable planets will be more red , and therefore the relative advantage of long wavelengths over short ones will be higher , for the nearest stars . for distant stars where",
    "only hot objects with blue infrared colors can be detected , long wavelengths observations are not as useful .",
    "for very nearby stars such as @xmath0 eri , where very interesting , extremely low - mass , low @xmath17 planets can be detected , the long wavelengths are very useful because the planets being sought have such red colors .",
    "planet - search observations at the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands have a considerable advantage over those in the more commonly used @xmath4 band regime for @xmath0 eri and a handful of other bright , very nearby stars . for",
    "more distant bright stars such as vega , @xmath1 and @xmath3 band observations give markedly better results only at separations inside about 3 arcsec , and in this regime no currently employed method gives sensitivity to any but the highest mass planets .",
    "observations in the bands we have employed are still useful on vega , but their use tends toward a diversification of planet - search effort in case theoretical models are overpredicting planets @xmath4 band brightnesses . for nearer systems such as @xmath0 eri , by contrast",
    ", @xmath1 and @xmath3 band observations clearly provide the best sensitivity at the most interesting separations , and it is the @xmath4 regime images that naturally take the role of diversifying effort under the supposition that the models may overpredict planet brightness at longer wavelengths .",
    "we have set a limit on the vega planet hypothesized by @xcite that is close to the 3 mj mass he suggested for it .",
    "it appears that @xcite could set a similar limit .",
    "the evidence seems fairly strong that no 3 mj planet exists at this location .",
    "this favors alternative models involving smaller planets , such as those of @xcite and @xcite , or a 3 mj planet in a larger orbit , such as that of @xcite .",
    "since a 3 mj planet around vega could be imaged in multiple wavelength regimes with current technology , more submillimeter observations and further modeling to determine if such a planet is required to explain the observed dust distribution is very desirable .",
    "if this does turn out to be the case , deep ao observations to detect the planet could be strongly prioritized , and a sucessful detection in one or more wavelength bands would be very likely .",
    "our @xmath0 eri observation was not timed to catch the known planet @xmath0 eri b at a large separation , and therefore our current data do not allow us to set an interesting limit on its mass .",
    "@xcite observed @xmath0 eri at several epochs of more promising separation using sdi , and set limits in the 9 - 10 mj range .",
    "we have set a limit of 4 - 5 mj for additional planets in more distant orbits around @xmath0 eri .",
    "the existence of a planet in such an orbit may be indicated by a long term rv trend @xcite and by a clearing of dust from the inner disk @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest a mass of around 1 mj for this hypothetical outer planet , so our non - detection is not surprising .    we have explored the question of whether sdi imaging @xcite or @xmath1 and @xmath3 band imaging ( this work ) is the method most likely ultimately to detect @xmath0 eri b. our @xmath3 band images were much more sensitive at small separations than our @xmath1 results , so we have not considered the latter .",
    "we find that the sensitivity of the @xcite observations at the best epoch , where the planet was near the optimal separation for sdi imaging , was still insufficiently sensitive to detect the planet by a factor of at least a thousand .",
    "by contrast our observations , if carried out at apastron , would have missed the planet by a factor of only about 12 .",
    "this striking difference suggests that it is at @xmath3 band that the planet @xmath0 eri b will first be imaged .",
    "a several - night observing campaign using clio at the mmt might detect it during the 2010 apastron passage , since we have observed the sensitivity in the speckle - dominated regions of @xmath3 band images does go up approximately as the square root of the exposure time .",
    "more advanced psf subtraction , or coronagraphic capability in clio @xcite , might reduce the required exposure time to detect the planet to as little as 2 nights . at present , we believe clio with mmtao is the only system capable of deep planet imaging integrations in the @xmath3 band .",
    "spitzer , despite its enormously lower background and correspondingly excellent sensitivity , does not have sufficient resolution to detect objects at the separations expected for orbiting planets .",
    "@xmath0 eri b could be studied in more detail using new giant telescopes such as the lbt and gmt with planned adaptive secondary ao systems .",
    "the @xmath3 band will remain the best wavelength choice for observations using these larger telescopes , so adaptive secondaries will remain essential : conventional ao systems even on giant telescopes will likely still have too high a thermal background for efficient , deep @xmath3 band images .",
    "an @xmath1 and @xmath3 band imager called lmircam is planned for the lbt @xcite .",
    "when jwst is launched , it should also deliver interesting scientific results on @xmath0 eri b. however , it is possible that the first image of this planet  the first direct image of any mature extrasolar planet  will be obtained using clio at the mmt in 2010 .",

    "<S> we have obtained deep adaptive optics ( ao ) images of vega and @xmath0 eri to search for planetary - mass companions . </S>",
    "<S> we observed at the mmt in the @xmath1 ( 3.8 @xmath2 m ) and @xmath3 ( 4.8 @xmath2 m ) bands using clio , a recently commissioned imager optimized for these wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> observing at these long wavelengths represents a departure from the @xmath4 band ( 1.65 @xmath2 m ) more commonly used for ao imaging searches for extrasolar planets . </S>",
    "<S> the long wavelengths offer better predicted planet / star flux ratios and cleaner ( higher strehl ) ao images , at the cost of lower diffraction limited resolution and higher sky background . </S>",
    "<S> we have not detected any planets or planet candidates around vega or @xmath0 eri . </S>",
    "<S> we report the sensitivities obtained around both stars , which correspond to upper limits on any planetary companions which may exist . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivities of our @xmath1 and @xmath3 band observations are comparable to those of the best @xmath4-regime observations of these stars . for @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> eri our @xmath3 band observations deliver considerably better sensitivity to close - in planets than any previously published results , and we show that the @xmath3 band is by far the best wavelength choice for attempts at ground - based ao imaging of the known planet @xmath0 eri b. the clio camera itself with mmtao may be capable of detecting @xmath0 eri b at its 2010 apastron , given a multi - night observing campaign . </S>",
    "<S> clio appears to be the only currently existing ao imager that has a realistic possibility of detecting @xmath0 eri b. </S>"
