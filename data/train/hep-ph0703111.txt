    "the cross section of hard scattering processes can be written as the convolution of parton distributions ( pdfs ) and the cross sections of hard subprocesses computed at parton level using perturbative qcd .",
    "the usual pdfs are the diagonal element of an operator in the wilson operator product expansion , which can be extracted from data for inclusive processes .",
    "on the other hand , there are a set of exclusive reactions which are described by the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , where the momentum , helicity or charge of the outgoing target are not the same as those of the correspondent ingoing particle .",
    "examples of such reactions are the virtual photon compton scattering and the vector meson electroproduction . in these cases ,",
    "the difference with the inclusive case is the longitudinal components of the incoming and outgoing proton momentum .",
    "precision data are becoming available for hard scattering processes whose description requires knowledge of these generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .    in recent years , significant effort was made to access gpds through the measurement of hard exclusive electroproduction processes .",
    "the simplest process in this respect is the electromagnetic deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , that is an electron scatters off a nucleon producing a real photon in the final state @xmath2 . on the other hand , studies on exclusive processes mediated by weak interactions",
    "have increased motivated by experimental proposals for neutrino factories and high intensity neutrino beams facilities . using a neutrino beam instead of an electromagnetic one the dvcs process into the weak sector can be investigated . for the neutral weak current one",
    "has the process @xmath3 , whereas for the charged current case occurs the process @xmath4 . in these cases ,",
    "one expects sensitivity to a different flavor decomposition of gpds and also due to the presence of the axial part of the v - a interaction they are sensitive to a different set of gpds .",
    "therefore , neutrino scattering on nucleons in the deeply virtual kinematics can shed light on the hadronic interactions mediated by electroweak currents .    recently",
    ", some sound works have addressed the dvcs process in case of weak interactions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the neutrino scattering off protons in the deeply virtual kinematics , which describes under a unified formalism elastic and deep inelastic neutrino scattering , was first studied via an extension of the notion of dvcs to the case of a neutral current exchange .",
    "afterwards , in ref .",
    "@xcite the investigation was extended for both charged and the neutral electroweak sectors , where the structure of the leading twist amplitudes of the process has been discussed . in a very updated investigation @xcite , the dvcs in weak sector is considered in the generalized bjorken limit and calculated at the leading twist within the framework of the nonlocal light - cone expansion via coordinate space qcd string operators .",
    "the cross sections for neutrino scattering off the nucleon , relevant for future high - intensity neutrino beam facilities are estimated .",
    "besides the gpds formalism for exclusive process , at high energies a simple and intuitive approach has attracted a wide interest .",
    "it is the color dipole formalism @xcite , where the interaction is described in the target rest frame and relies on the fock states expansion of the projectile and their further scattering with the target .",
    "specifically , the exclusive process @xmath5 is described by the interaction of @xmath6 pairs ( color dipoles ) , in which the virtual boson fluctuate into , with the nucleon",
    ". the scattering amplitude is given by the convolution of the dipole - nucleon cross section with the overlap of the virtual incoming boson and outgoing exclusive ( @xmath7 ) final state wave functions .",
    "this approach provides a very good description of the data on @xmath8 inclusive production , @xmath9 processes , diffractive deep inelastic and vector meson production ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the electromagnetic dvcs cross section is nicely reproduced in several implementations of the dipole cross section at low @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ability to predict cross sections at very high energies depends critically on the reliability of extrapolations from current measurements into regions of lower virtualities of the elementary scattering process , and much smaller values of the fractional momentum @xmath10 carried by the parton constituents of the hadrons .",
    "the color dipole approach is quite robust for doing this job .    in this letter",
    "we study the application of color dipole formalism to the dvcs process in electroweak sector . for real photon in the final state ,",
    "the qcd calculation becomes not trivial and saturation models can provide a suitable scheme for dealing with low momenta scales appearing in the problem .",
    "the present calculation is strongly motivated by recent studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the leading twist amplitudes for deeply virtual neutrino scattering ( dvns ) have been discussed .",
    "those investigations have considered the generalized bjorken limit within the framework of the nonlocal light - cone expansion , which involves gpds only for quarks . on the other hand , at higher energies the processes induced by gluons are increasingly important . therefore , the studies presented here are complementary to those in refs",
    ". @xcite . in next section",
    ", we make a short summary on the color dipole approach applied to electromagnetic dvcs and show its success in describing the high energy accelerator data . in sec . 3",
    ", we extend the formalism for the electroweak sector , considering for simplicity the neutral current case .",

    ", phenomenology considering nuclear targets is discussed .",
    "finally , in last section we summarize the results .",
    "let us introduce the main formulas concerning the color dipole picture applied to dvcs processes . in the dipole model @xcite",
    ", deep inelastic scattering is viewed as the interaction of a colour dipole , i.e. mostly a quark ",

    "the transverse size of the pair is denoted by @xmath12 and a quark carries a fraction @xmath13 of the photon s light - cone momentum . in the proton rest frame ,",

    "the quantity @xmath22 is the elementary amplitude for the scattering of a dipole of size @xmath12 on the proton , @xmath23 denotes the transverse momentum lost by the outgoing proton ( with @xmath24 ) , @xmath10 is the bjorken variable and @xmath25 is the photon virtuality .",

    "for dvcs , the amplitude involves a sum over quark flavours . here",

    "it has the great advantage of giving directly the @xmath57 dependence of elastic differential cross section without the necessity of considerations about the impact parameter details of the process .",
    "the authors expressed the exclusive production cross - sections in the high - energy limit in terms of the fourier - transformed dipole scattering amplitude off the proton @xmath22 .",
    "an important result about the growth of the dipole amplitude towards the saturation regime is the geometric scaling regime @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : bcgc ] ) .",
    "the parameters for @xmath70 are taken from the original cgc model @xcite .",
    "the final expression of mps saturation model is given by @xmath71 which is an extension of the forward model @xcite including the qcd predictions for non zero momentum transfer , which reproduces the initial model for @xmath72 and ensures that the saturation scale has the correct asymptotic behaviors .",
    "the remaining parameters are @xmath73 gev@xmath52 and @xmath74 gev@xmath52 ( obtained from a fit with boosted - gaussian meson wavefunction to describe exclusive vector meson production ) . in order to compute the dvcs cross section ,",
    "the amplitude above can be directly replaced in first line of eq ( [ eq : ampvecm ] ) .    in order to show the reliability of the models mentioned above , we compare them to the recent high energy dvcs measurements from desy - hera . in fig .",
