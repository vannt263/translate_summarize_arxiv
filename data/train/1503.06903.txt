    "were developed which were often directed to a specific application domain . in the historical development of  classical \" approximation theory ,",
    "all efforts were directed towards study of smooth approximants . on the other hand , many experimental and real world signals rarely show sensation of smoothness in their traces and hence demand rough functions for an effective representation .    following benoit mandelbrot",
    "s fractal vision of the universe , the notion of fractal function was introduced in reference @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was observed that fractal functions can be used for smooth approximation as well @xcite , thereby supplementing various traditional approximation techniques . for more than a quarter century of its first pronouncement , theory of fractal functions has been extensively researched and has evolved beyond its mathematical framework ; see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "specific applications of fractal interpolation function include medicine , physics , and economics with , for instance , in the study of tumor perfusion @xcite , electroencephalograms @xcite , turbulence @xcite , speech signals @xcite , signal processing @xcite , stock market @xcite etc .",
    "the fractal functions were originally introduced as continuous functions interpolating a prescribed set of data .",
    "thus , the approximation methods , both fractal functions and their precedents , are based on continuity , and methods for discontinuous approximation are limited . however , many real data requires to be modeled by discontinuous functions .",
    "for instance , discontinuous functions arise as solutions of partial differential equations describing different types of systems from classical physics",
    ". since machines have only finite precision , any functions as represented by machine will be discontinuous and so is anything which involves discretization .",
    "mandelbrot s view of the price movement in competitive markets is one of the profound sources of discontinuity . in words of mandelbrot @xcite :  ... but prices on competitive markets need not be continuous , and they are conspicuously discontinuous .",
    "the only reason for assuming continuity is that many sciences tend , knowingly or not , to copy the procedures that prove successful in newtonian physics .... \" hence it appears that mandelbrot envisaged not only a world of irregularity , but ultimate discontinuity .    deriving principle influence from these facts , the current article intends to investigate discontinuous fractal functions and their elementary properties .",
    "these fractal functions may not interpolate the data set , thus breaking the inherent continuity and interpolatory nature of the fractal functions in the traditional setting .",
    "discontinuous fractal functions reported recently in @xcite provides one of the impetus for the current study . however , our main aim is to show that the tools developed in 1986 paper @xcite are well - suited to deal with discontinuous fractal functions as well .",
    "further , we convey that the algebraic structure of equations governing fractal functions and their moment integrals are similar to that of usual continuous fractal interpolation function , but provides extra degrees of freedom . to this end",
    ", first we prove that the set of points of discontinuity of these fractal functions has lebesgue measure zero ; a fact that ensures riemann integrability . as a consequence , functional equations for various integral transforms of these discontinuous fractal functions can be easily derived , thus finding potential applications in various fields in science and engineering . for a restricted class of discontinuous fractal functions and its connection with weierstrass type functional equations ,",
    "the reader is invited to refer @xcite .",
    "interpolation  represents \" a function by preserving function values at prescribed knot points .",
    "a closely related but different approximation method is histopolation which preserves integrals of the function over the intervals of histopolation . given a mesh @xmath0 with strictly increasing knots and a histogram @xmath1 , that is @xmath2 is the frequency for the interval @xmath3 $ ] with mesh spacing @xmath4 , @xmath5 , histopolation seeks to find a function @xmath6 that satisfies the  area \" matching condition : @xmath7    there are several models that lead to histopolation problem .",
    "for instance , @xmath8 may be obtained from a finite sample with the observed frequency @xmath2 in the class interval @xmath9 for @xmath5 and area matching function @xmath6 may be taken as approximation of the unknown density function of the underlying random variable .",
    "the following fundamental problem occurring in one dimensional motion of a material point is another example where the problem of histopolation emerges quite naturally .",
    "suppose we have to model velocity @xmath10 of the material point wherein @xmath11 is the position of the point at time @xmath12 , which is known at specified points @xmath13 .",
    "then we have @xmath14 since @xmath15 a representative for @xmath6 can be obtained by solving the histopolation problem with values in the histogram @xmath8 given by @xmath16 in contrast to the vast literature available on interpolation , the researches on histopolation is limited . in case of smooth histopolant @xmath6 , the problem of histopolation",
    "can be easily transformed in to a problem of interpolation as follows .",
    "if we construct an interpolant @xmath17 $ ] with interpolation conditions @xmath18 , @xmath5 , where @xmath19 is arbitrary , then @xmath20 solves the histopolation problem .",
    "this may be one of the reasons for the obscurity of histopolation as a separate problem .",
    "however , the situation is different in the case of fractal functions as they are not differentiable in general . at the same time , as in the case of interpolation , constructing rough histopolants is of practical relevance . owing to these reasons ,",
    "fractal histopolation deserves special attention and it is to this that the last section of the paper focus on .",
    "+ overall , the current study may be viewed as an attempt to revitalize fractal functions and their applications and to initiate a study on fractal histopolation .",
