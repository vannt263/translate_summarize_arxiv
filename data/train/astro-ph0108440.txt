    "already in the early days of radio astronomy it was realised that number counts of radio sources contain important information about the distribution of radio sources as a function of redshift .",
    "early results showed that they were inconsistent with the predictions of a steady - state cosmology ( ryle & clarke 1961 ) , but that they could be explained by evolutionary cosmological models in which there were many more powerful radio sources at epochs earlier than the present .",
    "this could be directly inferred from the slope of the log@xmath3log@xmath4 curve above jy levels being steeper than the @xmath5 power law which the static , uniform , eucleidian universe must show . at",
    "sub - jy levels the slope changes gradually to a law flatter than the @xmath5 law as it must to escape the radio equivalent of olber s paradox .",
    "longair ( 1966 ) showed that the strong evolution must have been confined to the most powerful radio sources , because the observed range in power for radio sources was more than 5 orders of magnitude , while the turnover in the radio source counts covered less than 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "the initial steep slope and its turnover were subsequently accounted for by two distinct populations of radio sources .",
    "one population consisted of high radio luminosity sources undergoing strong cosmological evolution ( e.g. with comoving number densities about @xmath6 orders of magnitude higher at large redshifts ) , the other population was of low luminosity sources undergoing no or only little evolution with cosmological epoch . wall ( 1980 ) suggested that these two populations of non - evolving and strongly evolving radio sources corresponded to the fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) class i and ii galaxies respectively .",
    "this idea has been further developed by jackson and wall ( 1999 ) , who use the source counts at several frequencies and redshift information of the 3c sample , to link the fri and frii radio sources as the unbeamed parent populations of bl lac objects and flat spectrum quasars respectively .",
    "willott et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also defined a dual - population scheme , but slightly different from that of jackson & wall ( 1999 ) . in their scheme ,",
    "the low luminosity population is associated with radio galaxies with weak emission lines ( both fris and friis ) , and the high luminosity population is associated with radio galaxies and quasars with strong emission lines ( almost all friis ) .",
    "in contrast , dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) do not make a distinction between fri and friis , in their analysis of the statistics of steep spectrum radio sources , but allow for a luminosity dependent cosmological evolution .",
    "fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) showed that there is a distinct morphological difference between radio sources of high and low luminosity .",
    "the more powerful sources have their regions of highest surface brightness at the ends of a double lobed structure ( fr ii @xmath7 edge brightened ) , while the lower power objects show a variety of forms in which the highest brightness occurs near their centres , excluding their cores ( fr i @xmath7 edge - darkened ) .",
    "fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) found a sharp division between the two classes at @xmath8 w hz@xmath9sr@xmath9 .",
    "early optical work indicated that there is also a difference between the host galaxies of fri and frii type radio galaxies .",
    "owen and laing ( 1989 ) found that frii sources reside in normal giant elliptical galaxies with absolute magnitudes near @xmath10 of the schechter luminosity function , considerably fainter than first - ranked galaxies in rich clusters , while fri sources reside in galaxies which can generally be described as d or cd galaxies .",
    "however , more recently it has been shown by ledlow and owen ( 1996 ) that this result was caused by the combination of a sample selection effect and a strong positive correlation between the fri / ii radio luminosity cutoff and the absolute magnitude of the host - galaxy , with an increase of the transition luminosity from @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 w / hz at m@xmath14=@xmath721 , to @xmath11@xmath12@xmath15 w / hz at m@xmath14=@xmath724 . due to the small range of radio - luminosity in the owen and laing sample ,",
    "this correlation resulted in the friis generally residing in lower luminosity galaxies than the fris .",
    "the ledlow & owen result suggests that both fri and frii radio sources live in similar environments , but that the properties of the host galaxies may strongly influence the morphological appearance of the radio sources , at least for those near the division of the two classes .",
    "zirbel & baum ( 1995 ) found that for the same total radio power , frii galaxies produce 5@xmath730 times more",
    "emission - line luminosity than fri galaxies . in this light ,",
    "baum , zirbel & odea ( 1995 ) put forth the possibility that the fr dichotomy is due to qualitative differences in the structural properties of the central engines in these two types of sources , like the accretion rate and/or the spin of the central black hole . in contrast , gopal - krishna & wiita ( 2000 ) point out a class of double radio sources in which the two lobes exhibit clearly different fr morphologies .",
    "although these objects are rare , their existence supports explanations for the fr dychotomy based upon jet interaction with the external medium , and appears quite difficult to reconcile with the class of explanations that posit fundamental differences in the central engine .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > , < \" , ]     in both objects , the extended emission is detected at about a 10 @xmath16 level , implying that hdf123644 + 621133 could have been detected out to z@xmath121.7 at @xmath17 .",
    "we do not know the redshift of hff123725 + 621128 , but as we argued above , we believe it will probably be in the range 1@xmath18z@xmath181.5@xmath192 . if it were at z=1 , it would have a @xmath20 of @xmath191.7 . if it were at z=1.5 or z=2.0",
    ", it would have a @xmath20 of @xmath192.4 or @xmath193.0 .",
    "we therefore do the calculation for @xmath21 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 and 3.0 .",
    "the data are given in table [ calc ] , with the @xmath20 in column 1 , the comoving volume densities in column 2 , the expected number of fris in the hdf & hff with @xmath22 w hz@xmath9sr@xmath9 in column 3 .",
    "the chance , @xmath23 , to find _ two or more _ objects in this volume , if the expected number is @xmath24 is , @xmath25 which is derived using a poisson distribution .",
    "this is given in column 4 of table [ calc ] .",
    "it indicates that the presence of two fri radio galaxies in the hdf and hffs is inconsistent ( @xmath1 ) with a no - evolution scenario for fris , and that their comoving space density at @xmath26 was about an order of magnitude higher than at present time",
    ".      now that we have determined that it is unlikely that fri radio sources undergo no cosmological evolution from z=0 to z=1 , we want to investigate whether fri and frii radio sources have to be treated as to distinct populations of objects . in this section",
    "we will compare the data with the evolutionary models of dp90 .",
    "dp90 do not treat the fris and friis separately ; instead they adopt a luminosity - dependent cosmological evolution for the total population of steep spectrum sources , derived from source counts and redshift information .",
    "we will consider two of their models : the pure luminosity evolution model and the luminosity / density evolution model .",
    "in both cases , the low redshift luminosity function ( lf ) is fitted using two powerlaw slopes , with the lf being flatter below the break luminosity and steeper above . in the pure luminosity evolution model ,",
    "the overall shape of this lf does not change with cosmological epoch , only the normalisation in luminosity .",
    "since the slope of the lf is flatter at low luminosities , it results in less cosmological evolution for the weaker objects . since we only have to consider objects below the the break luminosity , where the slope of the luminosity function is @xmath27 , at a specific redshift the density is enhanced by a factor @xmath28 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is the amount of luminosity evolution , which is determined by dp90 to be @xmath30 . for the redshift ranges involved",
    ", the local space density of fris would on average be enhanced by a factor of @xmath31 , which corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "the data are given in table [ calc ] , with column 5 giving the mean density enhancement , column 6 giving the expected number of fris in the hdf & hff , and column 7 giving the chance of finding two or more fris in this area , for the pure luminosity evolution model of dp90 .",
    "the luminosity / density evolution model of dp90 is based on their pure luminosity evolution model , but modified to allow also the density normalisation to vary with z. in a similar fashion as above , but with slightly different parameters , this model would result in an average space density enhancement of a factor 4 to 7 , which implies a chance of finding two or more fris in this area of 2@xmath721% , for the luminosity / density evolution model of dp90 .",
    "this is given in columns 8@xmath710 of table [ calc ] .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the non - evolution models , the dp90 models , which do not treat fri and frii as distinct populations , predict surface densities of fri radio sources which are only slightly lower than found in the hdf and hff .",
    "the deep optical / radio observations of the hdf and hff have allowed for the first time an estimate of the space density of fri radio sources at high redshifts .",
    "the two fri radio sources present in this area of sky indicate that it is unlikely that fri radio sources undergo no cosmological evolution .",
    "we believe that this may undermine the reason for having a `` dual population '' scheme , in which the fri and frii radio sources are treated as separate classes of objects , with little or no evolution and strong cosmological evolution respectively ( eg . jackson & wall 1999 ) .",
    "we want to advocate a `` single population '' scheme , in which the cosmological evolution is a function of radio power , but not dependent on frclass .",
    "since powerful radio sources undergo a stronger evolution than the less powerful ones , and fris are mainly radio sources of low power , fris undergo less evolution than friis .",
    "however , the populations of fri and friis of similar radio power undergo similar cosmological evolution .",
    "indeed , the evolution models of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) , which make no distinction between frclasses , do fit number - count statistics and redshift distributions well .",
    "in addition they predict number densities which are comparable to that found in the hdf and hff .    basically , it is the coincidence of two observations which have led to a dual population scheme : 1 ) the v / v@xmath33 test showing that high power radio sources undergo strong space density enhancements and low power sources do not , and 2 ) the morphological dichotomy between sources of high and low radio power .",
    "however , the v / v@xmath33 tests for fri and frii are sensitive over very different redshift ranges .",
    "jackson and wall ( 1999 ) show in their figures 2 and 3 the mean v / v@xmath33 values as a function of radio power for fris and friis respectively , indicating an increase in v / v@xmath33 as function of radio power .",
    "we reproduce these values in figure [ vvmax ] , using different symbols for the two frclasses .",
    "as can be seen , no distinction can be made between the mean v / v@xmath33 values of fri and frii sources at a particular radio power .",
    "it is due to the fact that fris are of lower radio power , and therefore only found at the lowest redshifts , that they show a lower average v / v@xmath33 .",
    "we therefore believe that the results of the v / v@xmath33 test actually do not make a dual population scheme necessary , and perhaps even argue against one .",
    "willott et al . ( 2001 ) also introduced a dual population scheme in their analysis of complete flux density limited samples of 3c , 6c and 7c , which provided an unprecedented coverage of the redshift - luminosity plane .",
    "their division between low power radio sources with weak emission lines and high power radio sources with strong emission lines ( not by frclass ) , results in a space density enhancement of about an order of magnitude for the weak objects out to z=1 , and about three orders of magnitude for the powerful objects out to z=2 . using the current data it is difficult to make a distinction between this particular scheme and a single population scheme as proposed here",
    ": although the two schemes have conceptually different viewpoints , they result quantitatively in a very similar cosmological evolution for the fri galaxies .",
    "note however , that the evolution as proposed by willott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) results in a peculiar luminosity function at high redshift , with a prominent ` hump ' at the location of the break - luminosity at low redshift .    treating the population of powerful radio - loud agn as a single class of object",
    "would have many benefits , since in this way the two fr classes are closely linked .",
    "a popular paradigm is that the population of radio - loud agn come with a range of jet outputs , of which the more powerful may be strong enough to maintain their integrity until they impact on the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in a shock .",
    "this results in an frii .",
    "however , if the jet is too weak , it may dissipate its energy by entraining igm material , resulting in a more turbulent fri .",
    "this may also explain the dependence of the fri / frii radio power divide on the luminosity of the host galaxy : in more luminous galaxies , which reside in denser environments or which have denser ism , only jets of higher power can keep their integrity .",
    "if the dual population scheme were to be correct , and fris and friis undergo different cosmological evolutions , it would imply fundamental differences for these two classes of object , like the properties of their central engines such as black - hole spin or jet composition .",
    "as has been argued by gopal - krishna & wiita ( 2000 ) , the existence of radio sources , in which the two lobes exhibit clearly different fr morphologies , are difficult to reconcile with such models , but support explanations for the fr dichotomy based upon jet interaction with the medium external to the central engine .",
