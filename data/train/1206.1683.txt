    "<S> therefore , it is proper to locate the operating frequency range between the emission frequencies ( @xmath7 ) to make a good use of the gain molecules . however , the dramatic variations of the effective permittivity of gain shell at the emission frequencies should be avoid . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the density factors ( @xmath6 ) should be carefully chosen to make the effective permittivity varies smoothly between the emission frequencies , just as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] .    on the other hand , the imaginary part of @xmath20-parameter should also be considered . just as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2 ] , it is clear that between the emission frequencies , the imaginary part of @xmath20-parameter has two zero points ( @xmath28 ) . </S>",

    "<S> the second step is to determine a series of pole - zero pairs with respect to the operating frequency range , and it can be finished as follows :    1 .   </S>",

    "<S> this step starts with the determination of zeros . according to eqs .  , , and , it is clear that all zeros should be real functions of frequency . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is simple to define the zeros as the real part of @xmath20-parameter @xmath30 where the frequency @xmath31 is determined as follows @xmath32 and named as zero - frequency . </S>",

    "<S> when loss is taken into account , @xmath40 becomes continuous in the operating frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> however , without zero - variation , it is not near - zero in the operating frequency range . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a finite @xmath41 is also introduced due to the loss . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , with the varied zeros , @xmath40 becomes near - zero in the operating frequency range . yet </S>",

    "<S> clearly , @xmath41 can be dramatically reduced by gains . in this example </S>",
    "<S> the average reduction on the loss can be about 50% .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth noting that by increasing the number of layer , reducing the width of operating frequency range , or properly increasing the volume fraction of gain shell in the metal - gain capsule , better result can be obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> the zero - variation strategy is not only effective in designing genz metamterial , but also reveals the physical mechanism of broadband enz phenomenon , i.e. , the cancellation mechanism in electric displacement . </S>",

    "<S> and the volume fraction follows @xmath42 for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> initially , there is only one pole - zero pair in the spectral space for the first stack only , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , according to eqs .   and . </S>",
    "<S> by adding the second layer , it amounts to add an additional pole - zero pair ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) in the spectral space . on the left hand side of the additional pole @xmath45 , the polarization is out of phase with the response of the pole @xmath47 , thus yielding a zero @xmath46 between the poles . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the out - phase polarization can cause the cancellation of electric displacement , leading to a near - zero effective permittivity . by properly arrange a series of pole - zero pairs </S>",
    "<S> , the broadband enz can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the physical space , the spectral space has no concern with physical structure , thus it offers a more clear picture about the cancellation mechanism .    in this work , a strategy based on the milton representation of effective permittivity is proposed to design the broadband genz metamaterial . </S>",
    "<S> the application of milton representation not only simplifies the design procedure , but also reveals the physical mechanism dominating the broadband enz phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the potential applications of this strategy in practical design is also implied , since it is can be carried out numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , not only limited in the design of flat multi - layer broadband genz metamaterial , the strategy also offers a fundament to design broadband genz metamaterial in other geometrical structures , and material with other permittivity in a wide frequency range . </S>"
