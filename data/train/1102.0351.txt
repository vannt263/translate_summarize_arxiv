    "optical oscillations in optical waveguide arrays ( owa ) are harmonic when the propagation constants of the transverse modes are equally spaced @xcite .",
    "these oscillator waveguide arrays are of particular interest not only due to their applications in transmitting images @xcite , focusing and steering @xcite , tunneling @xcite , and switching and routing optical signals @xcite , but they are also good candidates for realizing the optical analogies of the dynamics in quantum systems @xcite . among these ,",
    "bloch oscillation ( bo ) and dipole oscillation ( do ) are two fundamental and important types of oscillations @xcite .",
    "bo is known as the oscillatory motion of a particle in a periodic potential under a constant force @xcite , whose optical equivalent in an owa is a linear gradient of the onsite propagation constants @xcite .",
    "do usually occurs at the bottom of a parabolic band @xcite . in the reciprocal space ,",
    "do distinguishes from bo that the bo momentum is accelerated monotonically by the force while the do momentum oscillates due to the confinement of a band @xcite .",
    "the steering between bo and do has been realized in a parabolic optical waveguide array @xcite .",
    "however , both bo and do decay fairly quickly due to the unequally spaced propagation constants in a parabolic band . in order to obtain long - living bo and",
    "do , we need to construct owas so that the eigenvalues of the propagation constants are equally spaced .    in the literature ,",
    "several models have been proposed to achieve this goal , for example , the wannier - stark waveguide arrays , which require an infinitely varying transverse refractive - index distribution @xcite . in real experiments",
    "@xcite , we need to truncate the system , which unavoidably disrupt the equally spaced propagation constants . as a result , the oscillations can decay rapidly , especially when the light beam is incident at the boundaries of the system . besides , there also exist dissipation @xcite , defects @xcite , and other kinds of damping effects in real systems .",
    "recently , a finite waveguide array with graded coupling constants described by the elements of a kac matrix was proposed @xcite .",
    "this is to achieve the required equally spaced propagation constants @xcite . from now on ,",
    "we refer these graded couplings @xmath0 to circular couplings as @xmath0 varies circularly as a function of waveguide index . in the finite waveguide arrays with a constant on - site potential , harmonic oscillation other than bo has been observed .",
    "the harmonic oscillation is similar to do , as it also oscillates in the reciprocal space .    in this work",
    ", we apply a linear gradient to the onsite propagation constants , which leads to the occurrence of bo . strictly speaking bo is approximate , because the band structure is elliptical caused by the combination of linear graded onsite potential and the circular couplings . due to the elliptical profile of the dispersion relation ,",
    "we call the array as the elliptical optical waveguide array ( eowa ) .",
    "we propose to realize a switching between do and bo or vice versa by ramping up the gradient of propagation constants .",
    "the do - bo transition is investigated through the field - evolution analysis and confirmed by the hamiltonian optics approach .",
    "the equally spaced propagation constants and switching between do and bo have potential applications in optical steering devices .",
    "the eowa consists of @xmath1 waveguides as shown schematically in figure [ fig : eowa ] .",
    "this array is divided into two zones ( zone 1 : @xmath2 and zone 2 : @xmath3 ) along the longitudinal @xmath4-axis direction , where there are two elliptical potential profiles @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : coup ] , each elliptical potential profile is formed by the circular couplings between adjacent waveguides ( @xmath0 , solid line ) and a linearly graded onsite propagation constant ( @xmath7 , dashed line )",
    ". the switching between bo and do can be achieved by ramping up the gradient of the propagation constant from zone 1 to zone 2 .",
    "the circular couplings are realized by carefully designing the structure of eowa .",
    "the linear gradient in propagation constants are obtained by taking advantage of the electro - optical effect or thermo - optical effect @xcite , and the the gradient strength is adjusted by the external voltage or temperature difference .",
    "the size of each waveguide is in the micrometer scale .",
    "however , the real physical parameters should be calibrated through experiments .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : eowa ] , the intensity of the discrete input beam has a gaussian distribution and its wave front is not a plane wave . the finite phase difference of excitations between adjacent waveguides is realized by putting a dielectric block just in front of the waveguide array .",
    "the light beam propagates along the axis of the waveguide array , that is , the @xmath4 direction .",
    "the waveguide array is labeled by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in the transverse direction .    as mentioned in the literature @xcite ,",
    "the waveguide arrays are analyzed by the coupled - mode theory @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary equation of modal amplitude @xmath10 in the @xmath8th waveguide is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the onsite propagation constant , @xmath13 is the gradient of the linear potential , @xmath14 is the onset propagation constant , which is set to be @xmath15 in this study , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the coupling constants between nearest - neighbor waveguides . in order to obtain harmonic bo and",
    "do , the values of the coupling constants should be designed appropriately , as described in the following .    substituting the solution @xmath18 into ( [ eq : modal ] ) , we have @xmath19 where @xmath20 means the wavenumber of the supermode @xmath21 and the transverse mode profile",
    "is given by a superposition of the mode amplitudes @xmath22 of the individual waveguides .",
    "equation ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) is rewritten in the matrix form @xmath23 where the hamiltonian matrix @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in order to achieve the harmonic bo and",
    "do , the eigenvalues of @xmath24 should be equally spaced .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath28 by @xmath28 kac matrix @xmath29 has equally spaced eigenvalues @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "the kac matrix is a tridiagonal matrix with elements @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ( otherwise ) , and is asymmetric ( non - hermitian ) .",
    "the kac matrix is symmetrized @xcite and the super and sub - diagonals of @xmath24 are defined as @xcite @xmath35 the symmetric hamiltonian matrix @xmath24 is similar to the kac matrix in a sense that both their eigenvalues are equally spaced .",
    "the column vector @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath24 , respectively . at a certain gradient @xmath13 , the eigenvalues @xmath37 have equal spacing @xmath38 , and",
    "thus the density of states is a constant @xmath39 .",
    "using the hamiltonian matrix @xmath24 , ( [ eq : modal ] ) is written as a @xmath4-dependent equation @xmath40 it is analogous to the schr@xmath41dinger equation in quantum system , @xmath42 here @xmath43 is taken to be unity .",
    "thus the quantities @xmath44 in optical waveguide arrays corresponds to @xmath45 in quantum system .",
    "we refer to the functional dependence of @xmath37 on transverse wavenumber @xmath46 as the dispersion relation in periodic optical waveguide arrays . for graded arrays",
    ", we can divide the infinite waveguide arrays into a large number of sub - waveguide arrays in the transverse direction , each of which can be regarded as infinite in size .",
    "based on the treatment of graded system , we can obtain the band structure approximately as follows .",
    "the solution satisfies the relation @xmath47 , where @xmath46 is the transverse wavenumber . substituting this relation into ( [ eq : amplitude ] )",
    ", we obtain the approximate pseudo - dispersion relation @xmath48 which is a function of waveguide index @xmath8 , wavenumber @xmath46 and gradient strength @xmath13 .    in the following calculations ,",
    "we use the model parameters : the waveguide number @xmath49 , the input waveguide number @xmath50 , the input wavenumber @xmath51 , the width of the input beam @xmath52 , the initial gradient strength @xmath53 and the ramped - up gradient strength @xmath54 in zone 1 and zone 2 , respectively .",
    "to analyze the various oscillations in eowa , we resort to an effective diagrammatic approach with the aid of a phase diagram @xcite . from the pseudo - dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp ] ) , two curves @xmath55 and @xmath56 serve as the upper and lower boundaries of the phase diagram for eowa , as shown in figure [ fig : pdmp](a ) . separated by two critical lines @xmath57 and @xmath58 , there are three different regions : lower do region , bo region , and upper do region . in these three regions ,",
    "do at the smaller @xmath8 side , bo at the middle , and do at the larger @xmath8 side take place , respectively .",
    "as stated in the previous research @xcite , there exist correspondences between various optical oscillations and the localization of different gradon modes in owa @xcite .",
    "the mode patterns of all the eigenmodes are shown by the contour plots of square moduli of eigenmodes as a function of eigenvalue @xmath37 and waveguide index @xmath8 , as shown in fig.[fig : pdmp](b ) .",
    "separated by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , there are also three different regions , which indicates three different gradon modes corresponding to the three kinds of optical oscillations .",
    "if we construct the light beam using components of a specific kind of gradon modes in a particular region , the light beam will undergo a certain type of oscillation , as shown by the three input gaussian beams in different oscillation regions in figure [ fig : pdmp](a ) . for a certain input beam ,",
    "is it possible to undergo do under certain conditions and bo under other conditions ?",
    "the answer is yes , we will present it in detail in the following sections .",
    "the switching between do and bo is realized by ramping up the gradient of the propagation constant .",
    "let us first sketch an example of the do - bo transition as shown in figure [ fig : dobo](a ) . in the range @xmath61 , the original onsite propagation constant has a linear gradient @xmath53 and",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath62 ( solid lines ) .",
    "this linear gradient together with the circular couplings leads to the long - living do for an input gaussian beam ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) . in the original potential profile ,",
    "the input light beam undergoes do between points a and b. after two periods , the gradient of propagation constant is changed to be @xmath54 when @xmath63 . as a consequence , the elliptical potential profile is changed to a new one ( as the dashed lines showed ) , the light beam is lifted from point a to point c and undergoes bo between points c and d in the new potential profile . in a word , the do - bo transition has been realized by varying the gradient strength of propagation constant from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . as shown in figure [ fig : dobo](b ) , the do - bo transition process a @xmath64 b @xmath64 c @xmath64 d is also marked on the phase - space orbit .",
    "the solid lines are for the original potential profile when @xmath53 and @xmath65 .",
    "since these curves are closed and their wavenumbers are confined to a certain range , these features indicate the occurrence of do .",
    "the dashed lines are for the new potential profile when @xmath54 and @xmath66 .",
    "the value of wavenumber @xmath67 has no limitation along these dashed lines , which indicates the occurrence of bo .",
    "the transition takes place between points a and c , which coincide on the phase - space orbit .",
    "the process of do - bo transition is investigated through the field - evolution analysis .",
    "the analysis is performed with an input wave function at @xmath68 , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the input transverse wave number .",
    "the incoming field at @xmath4 ( @xmath71 ) is @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the propagation constant of individual homogeneous channel .",
    "the intensity profile @xmath74 has a discrete gaussian distribution centered at the @xmath75th waveguide with spatial width @xmath76 .",
    "this input beam is a discrete gaussian beam , whose intensity distribution is schematically shown as the dashed line in figure [ fig : eowa ] .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath77}$ ] denotes the phase differences between input beams excited on the @xmath8th and the @xmath75th waveguides .",
    "other than the gaussian distribution , the input beam can take other functional forms .",
    "we expand the input wave function in terms of the supermodes @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the constituent component of the input gaussian beam .",
    "the subsequent wave function at propagation distance @xmath4 is given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : beam }    at a certain propagation distance @xmath4 , the wave function in the reciprocal space can be obtained by taking the following fourier transform latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : phik }    these wave functions , the mean value of @xmath8 and @xmath46 are obtained as @xmath82    the field evolution of do - bo transition is demonstrated by the contour plots of @xmath83 in the real space and @xmath84 in the reciprocal space , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xk](a ) and [ fig : xk](b ) , respectively .",
    "when @xmath2 , oscillatory motions take place in both real space and reciprocal space ( in a confined range ) , which indicates the occurrence of do in this range .",
    "when @xmath63 , there is still oscillatory motion in the real space ( with a smaller amplitude ) , which in the reciprocal space , the wavenumber @xmath67 is accelerated and can cover the whole range @xmath85 $ ] in the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "these features clearly show the occurrence of do - bo transition . the period of these harmonic oscillations @xmath86 can be obtained from @xmath87 and ( [ eq : beam ] ) , where the condition @xmath88 should be satisfied .",
    "thus the period is derived as @xmath89 .",
    "we need to emphasize that there is almost no leakage of field from the main orbit of field evolution . both do and bo can persist for a long propagation distance . this property is important in practical applications of propagating light in optical waveguide arrays .",
    "the results of do - bo transition obtained through the field - evolution analysis are now confirmed by the hamiltonian optics approach . from the pseudo - dispersion relation ( [ eq : disp ] ) , the evolution of the mean position and the mean wavenumber of the beam can be solved by using the equation of motion @xmath90 where the auxiliary variable @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is used to replace the discrete waveguide index @xmath8 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the numerical hamiltonian optics results of the mean position @xmath94 and the mean wavenumber @xmath95 are shown by solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : xk](c ) and [ fig : xk](d ) , respectively . the dashed lines and dots in figs .",
    "[ fig : xk](c ) and [ fig : xk](d ) are the mean values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 calculated from the field - evolution analysis results .",
    "the mean values obtained from two methods match very well with each other .",
    "as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the experimental realization of the eowa is similar to the experimental structures gaas / algaas @xcite . to obtain the required @xmath0 values ,",
    "the spacing between the waveguides was carefully designed based on the evanescent codirectional couplings @xcite . in the above investigation",
    ", we considered the nearest - neighbor couplings between waveguides .",
    "this consideration is valid when the field overlapping is significant between neighboring waveguides only .",
    "we can also extend this study to more general owas with higher - order couplings . as is shown in the reference @xcite , the second - order coupling in owa leads to nontrivial bo .",
    "it is instructive to consider higher - order couplings and the effects of defects in eowa .",
    "isolated defects can always disrupt the equally spaced eigenvalues and lead to damping , but longhi designed localized defects carefully by supersymmetric quantum mechanics and obtained undamped optical oscillations @xcite . from the basic physics point of view , an intrinsic harmonic system can naturally help us to access the competing damping mechanisms , like defects and disorder or even nonlinearity .",
    "thus in the future work , we will investigate the nature of the harmonic oscillation against these effects .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the dipole oscillation and bloch oscillation in the elliptical optical waveguide arrays , which possess a linear gradient in the onsite propagation constants and circular couplings between neighboring waveguides .",
    "the couplings between neighboring waveguides are designed according to the tridiagonal elements of a kac matrix , which is to achieve equally spaced eigenvalues . as a consequence , both do and bo are long - living , which is important to optical steering applications .",
    "we also proposed to realize the do - bo transition or vice versa by ramping up the gradient of propagation constants .",
    "the spatial evolution of the do - bo transition is demonstrated through the field - evolution analysis and confirmed by the hamiltonian optics approach .",
    "the long - living do and bo and their switching have viable applications in transmitting images , switching and routing of optical signals .",
