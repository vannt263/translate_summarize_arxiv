    "here we present analytical expressions for inferring the magnetic field vector from the observed stokes profiles induced by the zeeman effect in the weak field approximation .",
    "the weak field approximation is broadly applied for the inference of solar and stellar magnetic fields from the observation of the stokes profiles .",
    "it is an analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation whose main basic assumption is that the magnetic field is sufficiently weak throughout the whole region of the atmosphere where a spectral line is formed .",
    "although simple , this approximation is very useful since non - magnetic mechanisms usually dominate the shape of spectral lines , in both the solar and the stellar case .",
    "for example , in the quiet sun , which occupies the vast majority of the solar surface ( far from the sunspots that harbour very strong fields ) , the spectral lines are well described by the weak field approximation .",
    "this has allowed the success of many synoptic magnetographs like those of big bear @xcite .",
    "it is even used to produce modern vector magnetograms like those obtained with the imax instrument @xcite onboard the sunrise balloon @xcite .",
    "the weak field approximation has also been used to diagnose the chromosphere @xcite due to the enhanced thermal width of the spectral lines .    in night - time",
    "spectro - polarimetry , the weak field approximation is at the base of the least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the most successful technique used to detect and measure magnetic fields in solar - type stars or other stars in which the polarisation signal per spectral line is well below the noise level .",
    "other works have used this approximation to diagnose magnetic fields in a large variety of stellar objects .",
    "a limited selection includes some recent works on central stars of planetary nebulae @xcite , white dwarfs @xcite , pulsating stars @xcite , hot subdwarfs @xcite , ap and bp stars @xcite and chemically peculiar stars @xcite .",
    "the weak field approximation is an analytical solution to the radiative transfer equation .",
    "the fundamental assumption is that the magnetic field vector is constant and its intensity is sufficiently weak throughout the whole region of the atmosphere where an spectral line is formed .",
    "additionally , the line - of - sight velocity and any broadening mechanism have to be constant with height in the line formation region . as a consequence , the magnetic field can be considered as a perturbation to the zero - field case .",
    "quantitatively , the approximation holds whenever @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the zeeman splitting and @xmath2 is the dominant broadening mechanism ( thermal , rotation , etc . ) . from its definition , it is clear that the weak field regime occurs at different field strengths for different spectral lines ( depending on the sensitivity to the magnetic field , the local temperature and the atomic mass ) and for different stellar objects ( depending on any non - magnetic broadening mechanism for the spectral lines , the rotation being the most efficient mechanism in cool stars ) .    to first order in @xmath1 , the intensity profile of a spectral line formed in a weak magnetic field is insensitive to the magnetic field . in other words",
    ", it fulfils the transfer equation in the absence of a magnetic field . at this first order , the circular polarisation profile , i. e. , the stokes @xmath3 profile",
    ", for a given spectral line has the following expression : @xmath4 the symbol @xmath5 stands for the longitudinal component of the magnetic field , i. e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the inclination of the magnetic field with respect to the observer s line of sight ( @xmath8 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig_geom ] ) and @xmath9 is the magnetic field intensity .",
    "the symbol @xmath10 represents the effective land factor of the line , which quantifies the magnetic sensitivity of the line .",
    "the effective land factor only depends on the quantum numbers of the transition ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "equation [ eq : v ] is expressed in terms of the generic wavelength variable @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath11 represents the wavelength @xmath12 , then the parameter @xmath13 equals the central wavelength of the line , @xmath14 .",
    "however , it is customary in stellar spectropolarimetry to consider @xmath11 as the velocity in doppler units .",
    "in such a case , we have @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the speed of light . the constant @xmath17 g@xmath18 @xmath18 .    at first order in @xmath1 , both stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "are zero . in order to obtain an expression for the stokes profiles characterizing linear polarisation we have to expand the radiative transfer equation to second order in @xmath21 and assume that the spectral line is not saturated . under these assumptions ,",
    "the general formulae for the stokes @xmath19 and @xmath20 are : @xmath22 the symbol @xmath23 plays the role of the effective land factor for linear polarisation and quantifies the sensitivity of linear polarisation to the magnetic field .",
    "again , it is only a function of the quantum numbers of the transition ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the symbol @xmath24 is the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the angle @xmath25 represents the azimuth of the magnetic field vector with respect to an arbitrary reference direction ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ fig_geom ] show the coordinates chosen for the reference of @xmath28 ) .        when observing the polarised light in resolved sources like the sun , we detect specific intensities .",
    "however , when observing unresolved stars , the incoming polarised radiation is obtained as an integration in the plane of the sky of the individual stokes parameters at each point of the stellar surface . as a consequence ,",
    "the specific values of the stokes flux vector depends on the surface distribution of the magnetic field , on the centre - to - limb variation ( clv ) of the radiation , and the doppler effect due to stellar rotation .",
    "in this paper we neglect rotation , the derived expressions being valid for those cases where the broadening mechanisms dominate over rotation . in the sun , since we observe local profiles , the main broadening mechanism is typically thermal . in general , the polarimetric signals of 99% of the solar surface , the so - called quiet sun , can be explained in terms of the weak field regime in most spectral lines in the visible and the near - ir . for non - resolved objects ,",
    "the applicability depends strongly on the actual rotational velocity as compared with the temperature , the observed spectral line , the spectral resolution , the magnetic field organisation , etc .",
    "the thermal broadening depends on the square root of the ratio between the temperature and the atomic weight of the atom .",
    "therefore , in general , the larger the temperature and the lightest the atom , the larger the allowed rotational velocity . for low resolution spectrographs ( @xmath29 ) , basically the only remaining spectral lines ( that are not wiped out by the lack of spectral resolution ) are from hydrogen . for these lines , for a temperature of @xmath30 k , the maximum line of sight velocity is @xmath31 km s@xmath18 .",
    "however , when observing metal lines at spectral resolutions as high as @xmath32 , the allowed velocities are one order of magnitude lower .",
    "it is customary to introduce a parametrised form of the clv . in this work ,",
    "we assume a quadratic form ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gives a good balance between the quality of the clv and the simplicity of the analytical expressions presented in this paper for the polarised fluxes : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the intensity profile at disc centre ( @xmath35 ) . the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 have values between 0 and 1 and are supposed to be constant along the spectral line ( although they can vary from line to line )",
    "note that the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 have to fulfil the condition that @xmath38 .",
    "the clv is given in terms of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the astrocentric angle between the normal to a point in the stellar surface and the line of sight .",
    "using this law for the clv ( and neglecting rotation ) the flux for stokes @xmath41 is : @xmath42 where the integral is computed over the visible surface in the plane of the sky @xmath43 . for an arbitrary function @xmath44 of the polar coordinates of the stellar surface @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 , we have @xmath47 note that the variable @xmath48 , which means that @xmath49 . plugging the quadratic expression considered for the clv , the final closed expression for the integrated stokes @xmath41",

    "one of the simplest non - trivial configuration we can consider explicitly is that of a dipolar field . the magnetic field vector at each surface point is then : @xmath58 , \\label{eq : dipolo}\\ ] ] where the unitary vector @xmath59 defines the orientation of the dipole and the unit vector @xmath60 indicates positions on the stellar surface .",
    "the quantity @xmath61 represents the magnetic field strength at the poles of the dipolar field . from eq .",

    "the previous formalism has demonstrated that the weak - field approximation leads to formally the same expressions either if we consider specific intensities ( that is applied whenever spatial resolution is available ) or if we consider fluxes ( whenever the object of interest can not be resolved ) . in other words , the observed circular ( linear )",
    "polarised spectrum is proportional to the first ( second ) derivative of the observed intensity through the longitudinal ( orthogonal ) component of the magnetic field .",
    "the only difference resides on the exact definition of the components of the field which , in the spatially unresolved case , are an average over the stellar surface weighted by the clv .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity , it is possible to combine all expressions on the following general ones : @xmath67 the meaning of the newly defined variables is summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : variables ] .",

    "however , in practice , we have the simpler situation in which @xmath79 . moreover , although the number of photons arriving in the line cores are smaller than in the far wings , we make the approximation that the noise variance is wavelength - independent .",
    "furthermore , we also consider that it is independent of the considered line , so that @xmath80 .",
    "these simplifications lead to less cluttered expressions for the inferred parameters .",

    "figure [ fig : bias_sigma_cte ] displays the inversion of the synthetic profiles with different values of the standard deviation of the noise , from @xmath95 to @xmath102 in units of the continuum intensity , i@xmath103 . it is clear from the upper and lower left panels that both the longitudinal component of the magnetic field and the azimuthal angle are unbiased quantities .",
