    "weak gravitational lensing due to the deep gravitational potential of a galaxy cluster gives rise to a detectable weak distortion of the images of background galaxies .",
    "this weak shear has now been detected around roughly 30 clusters and been used to map the total dark - matter mass in the clusters as well as the dark - matter distributions within the clusters ( see bartelmann & schneider 2001 , mellier 1999 ) .",
    "weak lensing also has the potential to map the mass distribution on even larger scales @xcite .",
    "just last year , four groups independently reported detection of cosmic shear , distortions to background galaxies induced by weak gravitational lensing by mass inhomogeneities on _ few_-mpc scales along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that in the future , such cosmic - shear surveys will have the sensitivity to identify galaxy clusters in the field . since such surveys will probe the _ total _ mass directly",
    ", it could provide a powerful new technique for determining the cluster - halo abundance and thus the power - spectrum amplitude @xmath0 and matter density @xmath1 ( e.g. , kruse & schneider 1999 ; reblinsky et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "in fact , one spectroscopically - confirmed cluster has already been detected via its gravitational - lensing effect on background galaxies @xcite .",
    "more intriguing is the apparent dark lens discovered by erben et al .",
    "this lensing signal corresponds to a @xmath2 mass concentration , but there is no obvious corresponding galaxy overdensity ( gray et al .",
    "2001 ) and only faint ( if any ) x - ray emission .",
    "evidence for other apparent dark lenses has been reported by miralles et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and koopmans et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the latter involving a detection through strong , rather than weak , lensing .",
    "in retrospect , the existence of such dark concentrations should not come as too much of a surprise .",
    "galaxy clusters form at rare ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) high - density peaks of a gaussian primordial distribution . thus ,",
    "for every virialized cluster , there should be a significant number of proto - clusters ( e.g. , @xmath4 peaks ) , mass overdensities that have not yet undergone gravitational collapse and virialized , but which have begun to break away from the cosmological expansion .",
    "the timescale for collapse of cluster - mass objects is large , and the overdensities can be very large even before they have virialized .",
    "it should thus not be too surprising if such objects produce a weak - lensing signal that resembles that from virialized clusters .",
    "these proto - clusters should contain galaxies and maybe a few groups that later merge to form the cluster . since the x - ray luminosity is a very rapidly varying function of the virialized mass ,",
    "the summed x - ray emission from these objects should be much smaller than that from a fully virialized cluster of the same mass .",
    "when we refer to these proto - clusters as `` dark , '' we thus mean that they should be x - ray underluminous .",
    "strictly speaking , the mass - to - light ratios of these clusters should be comparable to those for ordinary clusters",
    ". however , high - redshift clusters may be difficult to pick out in galaxy surveys , and these proto - clusters should have a sky density a few times smaller . thus it would not be surprising if these dark lenses had no readily apparent corresponding galaxy overdensity .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the abundance of dark and virialized lenses .",
    "to do so , we first determine the overdensity required to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal as a function of redshift .",
    "we consider several different density profiles including a homogeneous sphere , an isothermal sphere , a navarro , frenk , & white @xcite profile and a hernquist @xcite profile .",
    "we then use the spherical - top - hat - collapse ( sthc ) model to determine the differential abundance of overdensities as a function of position along their evolutionary cycle . using the aperture mass technique ( schneider 1996 ) we",
    "can then determine the sky density and redshift distribution of halos that are sufficiently overdense to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal .",
    "as our results below will show , there should be roughly one dark lens for every 510 virialized lenses discovered by weak lensing .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that this result is robust in that the ratio of dark to virialized lenses is not expected to be very sensitive to the amount of _ observational _ noise in the lensing map , i.e. , observational noise will equally affect the detectability of both types of lenses .",
    "therefore , although our results are obtained by assuming the only source of noise is the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of the source galaxies  in accordance with other such theoretical weak - lensing studies found in the literature  the predicted relative abundance of dark and virialized lenses will not change very much if we made a more exact estimate of the total noise in weak - lensing maps .",
    "it is also encouraging to note that given the sky coverage and average image size of weak - lensing maps to date , the number of dark lenses we would expect to have seen is of order unity and therefore consistent with the detection ( erben et al .",
    "2000 , miralles et al .",
    "2002 ) of one or two dark lenses .",
    "in this section we provide the conditions for an overdensity of mass @xmath5 and radius @xmath6 at redshift @xmath7 to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal . following the procedure of bartelmann & schneider ( 2001 )",
    "( see also schneider 1996 , seitz & schneider 1997 , kruse & schneider 1999 ) we determine the dependence of a lensing system s signal - to - noise ratio on that system s overdensity and redshift .    in a weak - lensing map",
    ", a mass overdensity causes the image of the background source galaxies to be tangentially sheared .",
    "noise is introduced by both the intrinsic ellipticity of these background galaxies as well as by the presence of foreground galaxies in the image .",
    "to arrive at a signal - to - noise relation for a weak - lensing system , consider @xmath8 galaxy images each at angular position @xmath9 with tangential ellipticity @xmath10 and within a lens - centered annulus that is bounded by angular radii @xmath11 .",
    "the shear @xmath12 is related linearly to the dimensionless surface mass density of the lens , which is the physical surface mass density @xmath13 divided by the critical surface mass density @xmath14 . for a lens at redshift @xmath15 and a source at redshift @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the angular - diameter distances between the lens and the observer , the source galaxy and the observer , and the lens and the source , respectively . to account for the redshift distribution of the source galaxies , define ( seitz & schneider 1997 ) @xmath21 then the dimensionless surface mass density is given by , @xmath22",
    "furthermore , the linear relation between the shear and surface mass density implies that they have the same dependence on source redshift so that @xmath23 . for the rest of this paper",
    "any reference to @xmath24 or @xmath12 refers to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . assuming the intrinsic orientation of galaxy sources is random , the expectation value of the image ellipticity is @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the redshift distribution of source galaxies .",
    "the function @xmath30of order unity for the redshifts considered  allows a source redshift distribution to be collapsed onto a single redshift @xmath16 satisfying @xmath31 ( see bartelmann & schneider 2001 ) .    using",
    "the @xmath32-statistics introduced by schneider ( 1996 ) , define a discretized estimator for the spatially filtered mass inside a circular aperture of angular radius @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number density of galaxy images and @xmath36 is a weight function that will be chosen later so as to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the estimator . assuming the ellipticities of different images are uncorrelated the dispersion of @xmath32 can be obtained by squaring ( 6 ) and taking the expectation value , yielding @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dispersion of the two component ellipticity . by ( 4 )",
    "the expectation value of @xmath32 is , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the tangential shear .",
    "taking the ensemble average of ( 8) over the probability distribution for the galaxy positions gives , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mean tangential shear on a circle of angular radius @xmath33 and the subscript ` c ' stands for continuous .",
    "similarly , we can take the ensemble average of the dispersion ( 7 ) , to obtain @xmath43 the ensemble - averaged signal - to - noise ratio is then , @xmath44 by the cauchy - schwarz inequality the signal - to - noise ratio of the estimator is maximized if @xmath45 since @xmath46 @xcite where @xmath47 is the dimensionless mean surface mass density on a circle of radius @xmath33 and @xmath48 is the dimensionless mean surface mass density within a circle of radius @xmath33 , the maximized signal - to - noise ratio becomes @xmath49 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] if instead of using a maximized weight function @xmath36 we chose one of the often used generic weight functions given in schneider et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , our estimate of the signal - to - noise ratio for a given lens would be slightly smaller . in an upcoming paper ( weinberg & kamionkowski 2002 ) we show that although using such a weight function reduces the predicted abundance of dark and virialized lenses somewhat , the principle result of this paper , namely that the relative abundance of dark to virialized lenses is 1020% , is virtually unchanged so long as @xmath50 arcmin .    to compute the signal - to - noise ratio for a lens with a given density profile we need to determine the mean tangential shear of the source galaxies .",
    "different density profiles will in general produce different shear patterns . in particular",
    ", the more cuspy a profile is the stronger its lensing signal .",
    "of course this becomes more complicated when considering profiles with power - law breaks .",
    "for instance , although the nfw profile goes as @xmath51 at small radii while the isothermal sphere goes as @xmath52 , at larger radii the former varies as @xmath53 while the latter remains at @xmath52 . the net effect , as we will show ,",
    "is that the nfw profile yields a stronger signal compared to the isothermal sphere for lenses at reasonable redshifts .",
    "that said , we consider a variety of profiles to account for the full range of possibilities and to study the dependence of our results on these profiles .",
    "specifically , we compare the calculated abundances assuming the overdensity is a point mass , a uniform - density sphere , an isothermal sphere , an nfw profile and a hernquist profile .",
    "for an object of a given mass , mean overdensity , and density profile , we can solve for the parameters of the given profile ( e.g. , the radius , the velocity dispersion , the scale radius , the scale density , etc . ) and determine , using equation ( 14 ) , whether such an object produces a sufficiently large weak - lensing signal - to - noise ratio so as to be detectable .",
    "note that for an overdensity with angular radius smaller than the size of the lensing image , the shear pattern beyond the radius of the overdensity will be that of a point mass .",
    "furthermore , if the angular radius is larger than the image size then the lensing signal is determined by just the mass @xmath54 within the projected image radius @xmath55 and not the mass outside this radius .",
    "the derivation of the signal - to - noise relation for each of these profiles is given in the appendix .",
    "to produce a detectable signal , an overdensity must be large enough to yield a signal - to - noise ratio greater than some minimum value .",
    "for the calculations done in this paper we adopt the following fiducial values , unless stated otherwise : @xmath56 , @xmath57 arcmin , the number density of galaxy images is @xmath58 arcmin@xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the minimum nonlinear overdensity corresponds to a particular position along the linear - theory evolutionary cycle . in the next section",
    "we discuss how we relate the minimum _ nonlinear _ overdensity to a corresponding minimum _",
    "linear_-theory overdensity .",
    "this will enable us to apply the press - schechter formalism to obtain an estimate of the abundance of overdensities that produce a weak - lensing signal as a function of redshift .",
    "we use the sthc model to relate the minimum non - linear overdensity needed for a detectable weak - lensing signal at a given redshift to a minimum linear - theory overdensity . according to sthc the non - linear evolution of cosmic density fluctuations",
    "is approximated by a dynamical model in which the initial linear perturbation is an isolated , uniform sphere surrounded by unperturbed matter .",
    "gravitational instability causes the initially small linear perturbation to grow and enter the nonlinear regime , ultimately forming a virialized object that is decoupled from the cosmological background . in order to avoid the collapse to infinite density predicted by the solution of sthc",
    ", we invoke a simple smoothing scheme that allows us to map a linear overdensity greater than the critical linear density contrast , @xmath61 , to a finite nonlinear overdensity . in what follows",
    "we shall consider the sthc model in a @xmath62cdm universe .",
    "following the derivation of the relevant sthc formula , we present our smoothing scheme .",
    "finally , we discuss how we distinguish `` virialized '' clusters from those that have not yet collapsed .    for a flat cosmology with a cosmological constant",
    ", the change in the proper radius , @xmath63 , with scale factor @xmath64 for a uniform spherical overdensity of fixed mass @xmath5 is given by ( see peebles 1984 , eke et al .",

    "the evolution of the radius of an overdensity as a function of time is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "note that the cosmological constant has the effect of slowing the collapse as compared to a cdm universe .",

    "since @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the non - linear overdensity becomes @xmath81 for a given non - linear overdensity of mass @xmath5 at redshift @xmath7 we can find the radius of the perturbation @xmath63 such that @xmath82 .",
    "we can then solve equation ( 17 ) for @xmath67 .",
    "we now relate this same @xmath67 to the linear - theory perturbation amplitude .",
    "eke et al.(1996 ) showed that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the scale factor today , @xmath85 is the linear - theory overdensity extrapolated to the present and @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the linear - theory overdensity at redshift @xmath7 is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 , the linear theory growth factor for a @xmath62cdm cosmology , is @xmath89 using equations ( 20 ) , ( 22 ) , and ( 23 ) we get the desired relation between the linear - theory overdensity and @xmath67 : @xmath90 equations ( 17 ) , ( 19 ) and ( 24 ) therefore provide a map between the non - linear overdensity and the linear - theory overdensity at a given redshift .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath91 in the limit that @xmath92 , corresponding to the well known infinite density predicted by the solution of sthc .",
    "an actual overdensity will , of course , virialize before reaching the singular solution . to properly account for this we introduce the following smoothing scheme .    rather than assuming that an overdensity satisfies equation ( 19 ) throughout its evolution , assume it satisfies it only until it reaches the virialized overdensity @xmath93 .",
    "once the perturbation reaches the virialized overdensity take its radius to be a constant with time so that the overdensity continues to grow only because the cosmological background density keeps decreasing .",
    "the non - linear overdensity is therefore given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the scale factor at virialization .",
    "since @xmath96 , the linear - theory overdensity then becomes @xmath97 therefore , if the minimum non - linear overdensity needed to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal at redshift @xmath7 is larger than the virialization overdensity , we evaluate @xmath95 using equation ( 25 ) and then compute the minimum linear - theory overdensity using the lower expression in equation ( 26 ) . in figure 1",
    "we plot the radius of an overdensity as a function of time using this smoothing scheme . in figure 2",
    "we show the non - linear overdensity as a function of the linear - theory overdensity .",
    "note that the value of the overdensity at virialization can be obtained by assuming @xmath98 , the virialized radius , in equation ( 19 ) , and using the expression from lahav et al .",
    "( 1991 ) which gives the ratio between the turnaround radius and the virialization radius .",
    "for convenience we use the kitayama & suto ( 1996 ) approximation to @xmath99 , as well as their approximation to @xmath100 .",
    "we independently verified that both approximations matched the solution of the exact formalism described above .    in summary ,",
    "given the minimum non - linear overdensity needed to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal , @xmath101 , of an object of mass @xmath5 at redshift @xmath7 , we use equations ( 17 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) to compute the corresponding minimum linear - theory overdensity , @xmath102 , needed to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal .",
    "if @xmath103 then the object can produce a detectable weak gravitational lens , even though it is not yet virialized .",
    "to calculate the abundance of overdensities that produce a detectable weak - lensing signal as a function of redshift , we use press - schechter theory assuming gaussian statistics for the initial linear - theory density field .",
    "the differential number count of lensing objects per steradian , per unit redshift interval is @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the comoving - volume element , @xmath106 is the speed of light , @xmath107 is hubble s constant , and @xmath108 is the angular - diameter distance at redshift @xmath7 .",
    "the total number density of weak lenses is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 , the comoving number density of virialized objects of mass @xmath5 in the interval @xmath111 , is @xcite @xmath112.\\ ] ] in this paper we use the viana & liddle ( 1999 ) fits to the dispersion of the density field , @xmath113 , obtained from the galaxy cluster x - ray temperature distribution function .",
    "the function @xmath114 is the fraction of objects , either dark or virialized , that can lens ( @xmath115 ) relative to those that are virialized ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the probability that an object s linear overdensity is in the range @xmath117 is @xmath118 where ` erf ' is the error function .",
    "therefore , for dark lenses ( i.e. , those objects with @xmath119 ) @xmath120 while for virialized lenses ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) , @xmath123 for low enough masses , the minimum overdensity needed to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal becomes so large that both @xmath124 and @xmath125 approach zero , thereby imposing an effective weak - lensing mass threshold ( see section 5.2 ) . integrating equation ( 27 ) over redshift assuming @xmath126 yields the number count of dark lenses per unit area on the sky and similarly for virialized lenses when @xmath127 .",
    "we can now compute the sky density of weak lenses . to gain physical insight into the results as well as",
    "illustrate the calculational procedure discussed above we first show the redshift dependence of the minimum non - linear overdensity . as noted earlier ,",
    "the result is sensitive to the lens density profile on account of the minimum overdensity s dependence on the shear .",
    "since the shear is proportional to the surface mass density , the nfw and hernquist profiles ( for whom @xmath128 as @xmath91 ) have a constant shear at small radii while the isothermal sphere profile ( @xmath129 ) has a shear that goes as @xmath51 for all radii .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 , where we plot the radial dependence of the mean tangential shear for these different profiles .    in figure 4 , the minimum non - linear overdensity as a function of redshift for a @xmath130 object is plotted for the various profiles .",
    "all the profiles show the same general trend : a minimum at @xmath131 and monotonic rises at lower and higher redshifts .",
    "this is a consequence of the source - galaxy redshift distribution which we assume is given by a function of the form @xmath132,\\ ] ] with @xmath133 and mean redshift @xmath134 ( cf .",
    "smail et al .",
    "1995 ; brainerd et al . 1996 ; cohen et al . 2000 ) .",
    "since lenses are most effective when they lie midway between the source and the observer ( i.e. , the factor @xmath135 peaks when @xmath136 ) , an overdensity at @xmath131 is ideally positioned to lens source galaxies that are primarily located at @xmath137 , thereby accounting for the minimum in the curves .",
    "accordingly , overdensities located at lower and higher redshifts than @xmath131 are less effective at lensing so that a larger overdensity is needed to produce a detectable lens . in addition , for an overdensity with redshift approaching unity , there are fewer background galaxies to lens ( less signal ) as well as more foreground galaxies in the image ( greater noise ) , further decreasing the observed lensing signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "another feature to note in figure 4 is the difference in amplitude of @xmath138 between the different profiles .",
    "over most of the redshift range , the nfw profile requires the smallest overdensity in order to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal while the uniform - density sphere requires the largest .",
    "this is because the nfw profile has its mass much more centrally concentrated as compared to the uniform - density sphere . a source galaxy at some angular radius near the lens center",
    "will therefore be sheared more strongly by the former and hence produce a larger signal .",
    "a similar explanation accounts for the differences in amplitude of @xmath138 between the non - uniform profiles .      in figure 5",
    "we show the redshift distribution ( normalized to unity ) of dark and virialized lenses for the nfw , hernquist , and isothermal - sphere profiles .    because the minimum overdensity for the uniform - density sphere was so large , the probability of detecting a lens with such a profile is negligible and",
    "hence no longer considered .",
    "for all three profiles the distribution peaks at @xmath139 and has a full - width at half - maximum of @xmath140 .",
    "the distribution drops off at @xmath141 for two reasons : the minimum overdensity is becoming increasing large since @xmath142 and the sthc dynamics predicts fewer and fewer massive , large overdensities at these higher redshifts .    the sky density of dark lenses as a function of redshift for the same three profiles is shown in figure 6 . depending on the density profile ,",
    "we expect to find between @xmath143 dark lenses per square degree out to @xmath144 and virtually none at higher redshifts .",
    "the reason the hernquist profile predicts a smaller dark - lens sky density compared with the isothermal sphere and nfw is that such a profile requires a larger overdensity to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "finally , note that although this distribution is integrated over dark lenses of all masses , the minimum overdensity as a function of redshift becomes so large for @xmath145 that there are virtually no dark lenses with such small masses .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure 7 , where we plot the weak - lensing mass distribution ( i.e. , the integrand of equation ( 29 ) times the mass ) for both dark and virialized lenses at @xmath146 .",
    "furthermore , since the press - schechter mass function falls off steeply with mass , there will be very few dark lenses with @xmath147 despite the lower value of the minimum overdensity at these masses .    in figure 5 and 6",
    "we also show the redshift distribution and sky density of virialized lenses for the three different density profiles",
    ". although the weak - lensing mass threshold is , as expected , somewhat smaller for virialized lenses than for dark lenses ( see figure 7 ) their normalized distributions are not very different .",
    "nonetheless , the sky density of virialized lenses is @xmath148 degree@xmath59 and hence a factor of @xmath149 larger than the sky density of dark lenses .",
    "this is because by redshifts of @xmath139 ( where the distributions peak ) a majority of objects in the mass range that can lens will have already virialized .",
    "having computed the redshift distribution and sky density of dark and virialized lenses we now determine their relative abundances .",
    "the fraction of weak lenses that are caused by dark , non - virialized objects as a function of redshift is shown in the left panel of figure 8 . out to @xmath150",
    "the fraction is nearly constant with about 20% of all weak lenses arising from dark objects .",
    "we again emphasize that the predicted abundance of dark lenses relative to virialized lenses is significant not because dark lenses comprise the lower - mass end of the mass function ; on the contrary , virialized lenses have a lower mass threshold than dark lenses as shown in figure 7 .",
    "rather , it is significant because according to the sthc model , a substantial fraction of cluster - mass objects are sufficiently overdense to produce a detectable lensing signal despite not having reached the virialization overdensity . for @xmath151 the abundance of weak lenses of all types ( both virialized and dark ) drops off significantly .",
    "this , again , is because @xmath152 and because the evolution of overdensities has not yet had enough time to produce sufficiently large overdensities .",
    "this is also illustrated in the right panel of figure 8 where we show the fraction of virialized objects that can lens as a function of redshift .",
    "for @xmath153 a large fraction of virialized objects with @xmath154 can produce a detectable weak - lensing signal but , for the same reason as above , by @xmath144 this fraction is nearly zero .",
    "finally we would like to point out that given the above results for the weak - lensing mass distribution , it is not surprising that in their study of weak lensing by low - mass galaxy groups , hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2001 ) could only ( just barely ) detect a weak - lensing signal by stacking 50 such groups together .",
    "namely , the groups in hoekstra et al.s sample , which were at a mean redshift of 0.3 , had a mean overdensity of only @xmath155 75 and a mean mass of just @xmath155 @xmath156 , assuming an isothermal density profile and using their measured value of @xmath155 275 km s@xmath157 for the lensing - inferred velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore , as figure 7 suggests , individual groups from their sample were neither massive enough nor sufficiently overdense to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal .      in the above calculations we assume that the lensing images are 5 arcmin in radius , roughly the size of lensing maps to date",
    "however , if a lens is relatively nearby or has a large radial extent it is possible that a large fraction of the total lensing signal is missed .",
    "this effect might be especially troublesome for the detection of dark lenses , given that they are not yet virialized and hence have larger radii .",
    "we now address this issue by determining the extent to which increasing the image size alters the predicted abundance of dark lenses .    before moving on however",
    ", we note that while we examined the predicted distribution and sky density of weak lenses for a variety of profiles , there is good reason to regard the nfw profile as the most plausible .",
    "for virialized lenses this is clearly the case as n - body simulations show that the halo density profiles are well fit by the nfw form .",
    "though it is difficult to be as certain in the case of dark , non - virialized , lenses ( n - body simulation fits to profiles have so far only been for virialized systems ) , because most of the dark lenses are well past turnaround ( @xmath158 ) and because it is unlikely that the sthc model perfectly describes the evolution of overdensities all the way to virialization , assuming an nfw profile for dark lenses is a fair approximation .",
    "furthermore , since virialization is expected to occur from inside - out , the centers of dark lenses , where most of the lensing signal is coming from ( as we show quantitatively below ) , are likely near virialization and hence well described by the nfw profile . for these reasons ( and also to avoid overly cluttered figures ) , the rest of the figures in this paper show results only for the nfw profile . to obtain approximate results for the other profiles , simply scale by the relative abundances shown in figure 6 .    in figure 9",
    "we plot the cumulative signal - to - noise ratio and the fraction of the total signal as a function of the angular distance from the lens center for a lens with an nfw profile at redshift @xmath159 with mass @xmath160 .",
    "although the fraction of the signal that comes from within 5 arcmin is @xmath161% for lenses of overdensity @xmath162 and @xmath163 the lens with overdensity 200 requires an image size of just @xmath155 2 arcmin to be detectable ( @xmath164 ) while the lens with overdensity 70 requires @xmath165 arcmin to be detectable . in general we find that in order to detect nearly all dark lenses with @xmath166 in a given field the image area must be at least @xmath167 degree@xmath168 , as shown in figure 10 .",
    "larger image sizes will not significantly increase the number of dark lenses detected as very little signal comes from radii larger than 15 arcmin . also note that although lensing geometry favors a lens midway between observer and source , this effect is somewhat countered by the fact that the closer a weak lens is to the observer , the closer the source galaxy images pass to the highly overdense lens center ( i.e. , the solid angle subtended by the lens is larger ) . as a result , if the image size is large enough to enclose a large portion of the lens core , the lensing signal will be most strong when the lens - observer distance is slightly smaller than the lens - source distance .",
    "this accounts for the shift , shown in figure 10 , of the minimum of @xmath169 toward smaller redshift as the image size is increased .      the present - day abundance of rich , x - ray clusters has been used to constrain the value of @xmath0 , the amplitude of mass fluctuations in spheres of radius 8@xmath170 mpc ( evrard 1989",

    "we show the extent to which the measured abundance of weak lenses ( from future cosmic - shear surveys , say ) can further constrain @xmath0 . here",
    "we have plotted the sky density of weak lenses ( both virialized and dark ) at the 95% confidence limits of @xmath0 given by viana & liddle ( 1999 ) . since",
    "weak lenses are produced by only relatively rare objects , their abundance is very sensitive to the value of @xmath0 , suggesting the usefulness of weak lenses in measuring the amplitude of mass fluctuations .",
    "another benefit of using weak lenses to measure @xmath0 is their broad redshift distribution . in particular , a systematic uncertainty in measuring @xmath0 by measuring rich cluster abundances is the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 that arises from the limited range in redshift in which rich clusters are observed . to break this degeneracy substantial effort",
    "is made to measure not only the present - day rich cluster abundance but also the rich cluster abundance at higher redshifts ( @xmath171 ; e.g. , henry 1997 ) .",
    "this , in turn , gives an estimate of the evolution of the cluster mass function and hence an estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "however , because they are faint , detecting high redshift ( @xmath172 ) rich clusters is difficult .",
    "weak lenses , on the other hand , do not suffer from this limitation and in fact are expected to have a broad redshift distribution and be most abundant at @xmath173 ( see figure 5 ) . as a result , detecting weak lenses",
    "provides an excellent means of measuring the evolution of the mass function and hence measuring @xmath1 .",
    "by thereby breaking the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , weak lensing surveys are also well - suited to constrain the power - spectrum amplitude , @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the abundance of dark and virialized lenses .",
    "this was accomplished by first expressing the lensing signal strength as a function of the dark - matter overdensity and redshift .",
    "having determined the overdensity required to produce a detectable weak - lensing signal we used the sthc model to calculate the differential abundance of overdensities as a function of position along their evolutionary cycle .",
    "overdensities whose lensing signal yielded @xmath166 were divided into two classes : those with @xmath174 were dark lenses while those with @xmath175 were virialized lenses .",
    "the distinction between dark and virialized lenses was based on the former being at an unrelaxed , and hence earlier , stage in the overdensity evolutionary cycle .",
    "this distinction is not arbitrary but rather is expected to result in observational features that definitively separate the two classes of lenses .",
    "for instance , since dark lenses will typically have overdensities of @xmath176 while virialized lenses have @xmath177 ( see figure 4 ) , the projected surface density of a dark lens is smaller than that in a virialized lens by a factor of @xmath178 .",
    "the sky density of galaxies in a dark lens will therefore be about two times smaller than in a virialized lens .",
    "as it is difficult to detect a significant galaxy overdensity for even a virialized , lensing , cluster at redshifts of @xmath173 , it will be all the more difficult to do so for a dark cluster .",
    "another distinctive observational feature expected of dark lenses is a low x - ray luminosity as compared with virialized lenses , a consequence of the x - ray luminosity function s steep dependence on total virialized mass .",
    "this effect might also account for the low x - ray luminosities observed by postman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in three high - redshift clusters ; namely , these objects are in fact proto - clusters that have not yet completely virialized .    although we considered a variety of density profiles in our calculations of the predicted distribution and sky density of weak lenses , as we noted in section 5.3 , there is good reason to regard the nfw profile as the most plausible form for both virialized and dark lenses .",
    "nonetheless , while n - body simulations show that virialized systems are well fit by the nfw form , testing whether non - virialized , cluster - mass , halos in n - body simulations are also well described by the nfw profile is a worthwhile investigation that has not yet been performed .",
    "that said , we have shown that the redshift distribution of dark and virialized lenses for all the considered profiles is fairly broad with an average around @xmath146 and a fwhm of @xmath140 .",
    "the sky density of dark lenses for the nfw profile was calculated to be @xmath179 degree@xmath59 ( and @xmath165 degree@xmath59 for an isothermal sphere profile ) and should therefore be readily detectable by upcoming cosmic shear surveys . for virialized lenses , we found a sky density of @xmath180 degree@xmath59 assuming an nfw profile ( and @xmath181 degree@xmath59 for an isothermal sphere profile ) , a factor of 4 to 5 larger than that of dark lenses .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that most of the weak lenses are at redshift @xmath139 and have masses of @xmath2 so that the majority are , according to the sthc model , virialized .",
    "it is important to note that while the aperture mass weight function used here was chosen to match a specific density profile , as we show in an upcoming paper ( weinberg & kamionkowski 2002 ) , a more general , non - optimal weight function , such as that given by schneider et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , would lower the overall abundance of both types of lenses equally .",
    "the principle result of this paper , namely the expectation that @xmath182% of weak - lenses are dark , would not change .",
    "we find it encouraging that given the sky coverage of weak - lensing maps to date ( @xmath183 arcmin@xmath168 ) and the average size of the individual lensing maps ( @xmath184 arcmin@xmath168 ) , the number of dark lenses we would expect to have seen is of order unity and thus consistent with the detection ( erben et al .",
    "2000 , miralles et al .",
    "2002 ) of one or two dark lenses .",
    "furthermore , in mock observations of numerical simulations , white , van waerbeke , & mackey ( 2001 ) showed that a weak - lensing search for clusters will likely suffer from serious line - of - sight projection effects due to the fact that clusters preferentially live in larger structures .",
    "these structures on larger scales , which perhaps correspond to 2@xmath185  3@xmath185 peaks in the primordial distribution , may well be the type of systems that we find give rise to dark lenses .",
    "finally , we have also shown that measuring the abundance of weak lenses can substantially help to constrain @xmath0 , the rms mass fluctuation in spheres of radius 8@xmath170 mpc .",
    "this is a consequence of the broad redshift distribution of weak lenses and the fact that they correspond to high - density peaks in the gaussian primordial distribution .",
    "cosmic - shear surveys , with their ability to detect cluster mass weak lenses over large areas of sky , should therefore provide a powerful new technique for determining the power - spectrum amplitude .",
