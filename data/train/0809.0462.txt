    "in the present paper , the single - diffractive ( sd ) reaction @xmath3 is studied , in which @xmath4 includes a @xmath0 boson ( fig .  [",
    "fig : diagram ] ) . the @xmath6 decay mode is considered .",
    "this reaction is sensitive to the diffractive structure function of the proton and to the rapidity gap survival probability  @xcite .",
    "this process has been studied at the tevatron , where the ratio of the yields for sd and inclusive @xmath0 production has been measured to be approximately 1%  @xcite .    r0.5        the aim of this analysis is to demonstrate the feasibility of observing sd @xmath0 production at cms given an integrated effective luminosity for single interactions of 100  pb@xmath5 ; this effective luminosity will be lower than the integrated delivered luminosity and will depend on the machine conditions .",
    "the cms apparatus is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two experimental scenarios are considered here . in the first , no forward detectors beyond the cms forward calorimeter hf , which covers the region in pseudo - rapidity of @xmath7 , are assumed . in the second",
    ", additional coverage at @xmath8 is assumed by means of the castor calorimeter .",
    "single diffractive @xmath0 production was simulated by using the pomwig generator  @xcite , version v2.0 beta .",
    "for the diffractive pdfs and the pomeron flux , the result of the nlo h1 2006 fit b  @xcite was used . a rapidity gap survival probability of 0.05 , as predicted in  @xcite ,",
    "is assumed .",
    "the cross section , for the @xmath9 mode , is about 70  pb , leading to @xmath10 events per 100  pb@xmath5 . for non - diffractive @xmath0 production ,",
    "the pythia generator was used  @xcite .",
    "the cross section , for the @xmath11 mode , is about 22 nb ( nlo ) . with the given numbers for the cross sections , the ratio of diffractive to inclusive yields is 0.3% .",
    "the selection of the events with a candidate @xmath0 decaying to @xmath12 is the same as that used in  @xcite .",
    "events with a candidate muon in the pseudo - rapidity range @xmath13 and transverse momentum @xmath14  gev were rejected , as were events with at least two muons with @xmath15  gev .",
    "muon isolation was imposed by requiring @xmath16  gev in a cone with @xmath17 .",
    "the transverse mass was required to be @xmath18  gev .",
    "the contribution from top events containing muons was reduced by rejecting events with more than 3 jets with @xmath19  gev ( selected with a cone algorithm with radius of 0.5 ) and events with acoplanarity ( @xmath20 ) between the muon and the direction associated to @xmath21 greater than 1 rad .",
    "approximately 2,400 sd @xmath0 events and 600,000 non - diffractive @xmath0 events per 100  pb@xmath5 are expected to pass these cuts .",
    "r0.5        figure  [ fig : etagen ] shows the generated energy - weighted @xmath22 distribution for stable particles ( excluding neutrinos ) in diffractive and non - diffractive events , including the scattered proton ; all events were generated with the scattered proton at positive rapidities ( the peak at @xmath23 ) .",
    "diffractive events have , on average , lower multiplicity both in the central region and in the hemisphere that contains the scattered proton , the so - called  gap side \" , than non - diffractive events .",
    "the gap side was selected as that with lower energy sum in the hf .",
    "a cut was then placed on the multiplicity of tracks with @xmath24  mev and @xmath25 . for the events passing this cut , multiplicity distributions in the hf and castor calorimeters in the gap side",
    "were studied , from which a diffractive sample can be extracted .        figure  [ fig : hf - hf - nt5 ] shows the hf tower multiplicity for the low-@xmath22 (  central slice \" , @xmath26 ) and high-@xmath22 hf (  forward slice \" , @xmath27 ) regions for events with central track multiplicity @xmath28 .",
    "the top left and top right plots show the distributions expected for the diffractive @xmath0 events with generated gap in the positive and negative @xmath29 direction , respectively ; they exhibit a clear peak at zero multiplicity .",
    "conversely , the non - diffractive @xmath0 events have on average higher multiplicities , as shown in the bottom left plot .",
    "finally , the bottom right plot shows the sum of the pomwig and pythia distributions  this is the type of distribution expected from the data .",
    "the diffractive signal at low multiplicities is visible .",
    "l0.6          the hf tower multiplicity vs castor @xmath30 sector multiplicity was studied for the gap side . since",
    "castor will be installed at first on the negative side of the interaction point , only events with the gap on that side ( as determined with the procedure discussed above ) were considered . the cms software chain available for this study did not include simulation / reconstruction code for castor",
    "; therefore , the multiplicity of generated hadrons with energy above a 10  gev threshold in each of the castor azimuthal sectors was used .",
    "figure  [ fig : hf - castor - nt5 ] shows plots analogous to those of fig .",
    "[ fig : hf - hf - nt5 ] for the combination of hf and castor .",
    "the top plots show the pomwig distributions ; the few events in the top left plot are those for which the gap - side determination was incorrect .",
    "the signal to background ratio improves greatly with respect to the hf only case .",
    "r0.6          the two - dimensional multiplicity plots of figs .",
    "[ fig : hf - hf - nt5 ] and  [ fig : hf - castor - nt5 ] provide evidence of sd @xmath0 production .",
    "a simple way to isolate a sample of diffractive events from these plots is to use the zero - multiplicity bins , where the diffractive events cluster and the non - diffractive background is small .",
    "the hf plus castor condition yields the best signal to background ratio .",
    "when an integrated effective luminosity for single interactions of 100  pb@xmath5 becomes available , sd @xmath6 production can then be observed with @xmath31 signal events .",
    "backgrounds other than non - diffractive @xmath0 production are discussed in the next section and appear to be under control .",
    "the background from qcd events has been quantified by repeating the analysis on a pythia sample with lepton - enriched qcd events .",
    "the effect is to increase the number of events in the low - multiplicity region by less than 1% of the sd yield .",
    "non - diffractive @xmath0 events , misidentified as diffractive , have been discussed in the previous sections , where we showed they can be kept under control .",
    "sd @xmath0 production with proton - dissociation , @xmath32 , where @xmath4 contains a @xmath0 boson and @xmath33 is a low - mass state into which the proton has diffractively dissociated , is an irreducible background when @xmath33 escapes undetected in the forward region .",
    "a study of proton - dissociation has been carried out in  @xcite , where it has been shown that about 50% of the proton - dissociative background can be rejected by vetoing events with activity in the cms zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) , which provides coverage for neutral particles for @xmath34 .",
    "the net effect is to enhance the diffractive signal in the zero multiplicity bin of fig .",
    "[ fig : hf - castor - nt5 ] by about 30% .",
    "a procedure has been discussed to arrive at the observation of single diffractive @xmath6 production with an integrated effective luminosity for single interactions of 100  pb@xmath5 .",
    "the procedure is based on the detection of large rapidity gaps in the final state of the event using hf and castor , complemented by the multiplicity information from the central tracker .    assuming a rapidity gap survival probability of 0.05 , @xmath31 reconstructed signal events",
    "are expected with a high signal - to - background ratio if the castor calorimeter is available .",
    "if castor is not available , the hf information alone may be sufficient .",
    "further improvements are possible if the detectors of the totem experiment  @xcite can be used , notably the t2 tracker and the roman pot detectors ."
