    "the study of one - particle motion in deformed potentials is the basis for understanding the structure of deformed drip - line nuclei .",
    "since the fermi level of drip line nuclei lies close to the continuum , both weakly - bound and positive - energy one - particle levels play a crucial role in the many - body correlation of those nuclei . among an infinite number of one - particle levels at a given positive - energy , only some selected levels related to one - particle resonant levels will be important to bound states of drip - line nuclei .",
    "the motion of weakly - bound or low - energy resonant protons is not so different from that of well - bound protons except for very light nuclei , due to the presence of the coulomb barrier .",
    "therefore , the present talk is devoted to the change of shell structure of one - neutron levels .",
    "the change of the shell structure in weakly - bound and resonant one - neutron levels is exhibited , which comes from the behavior unique in the one - particle motion with low orbital - angular - momenta ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "for spherical shape the centrifugal barrier is absent for @xmath3=0 orbits while the barrier is low for @xmath3=1 . for deformed shape",
    "a given one - particle wave - function contains components with various @xmath3 values , however , the minimum value of possible @xmath3 for the wave - function components plays a crucial role in the present problem . for example , in the case of axially - symmetric quadrupole deformation @xmath4= 0 for @xmath5 = @xmath6 and @xmath4=1 for both @xmath5 = 3/2@xmath7 and 1/2@xmath7 , where @xmath8 expresses the component of the particle angular - momentum along the symmetry axis . for bound one - particle levels",
    "the @xmath9 component becomes always overwhelming in one - particle wave - functions with @xmath10 , as the binding energy approaches zero .",
    "namely , in the limit of small binding energy the halo phenomena which are created exclusively by the @xmath9 neutron wave - function appear for both spherical and deformed shapes .",
    "on the other hand , the decay of @xmath10 one - particle resonances goes most easily through the @xmath11 channel because of the absence of the centrifugal barrier .",
    "therefore , it is in general difficult for an @xmath5 = 1/2@xmath12 nilsson level to survive as a resonant level in the positive - energy region .",
    "nevertheless , we note that a given one - particle resonance with @xmath10 may survive even at several mev excitation - energy , if the higher-@xmath3 components are predominant in the wave function inside the potential . in such cases",
    "the existence of the resonance is made possible by the presence of the higher-@xmath3 components while the width of the resonance is determined by the small @xmath9 component .",
    "one - particle resonant levels for spherical shape are defined in terms of phase shift as described in standard textbooks . on the other hand ,",
    "the definition of one - particle resonance for deformed potentials is obtained using the eigenphase formalism @xcite .",
    "the definition is a natural extension of the definition of one - particle resonance for spherical potentials in terms of phase shift .",
    "taking the three bound one - particle levels for neutrons in the @xmath13 shell , in @xcite it is shown how the order of the three levels varies as a function of binding energies : from the bottom to the top in energy , ( i ) the relative level order is @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for strongly bound cases , ; ( ii ) @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath15 for about 10 mev binding and ( iii ) @xmath16 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 for very weak bindings .",
    "namely , the @xmath9 level shifts downwards relative to the @xmath17 levels , as the potential strength becomes weaker or the binding energy becomes smaller .",
    "the level order in ( ii ) is known as the usual energy splitting in stable @xmath13-shell nuclei , which is used in the shell model . in the present",
    "talk we concentrate on the shell structure of bound and resonant neutron levels in the @xmath18-shell as well as in the @xmath19 major shell , taking examples of a stable @xmath13-shell nucleus ( figure 1 ) , a known deformed neutron - drip - line nucleus ( figure 2 ) , and a not yet observed neutron - drip - line nucleus in the region of medium mass ( figure 3 ) .",
    "in the description of one - particle resonances the formalism using complex energy is sometimes popular in the literature .",
    "however , it is equally possible to formulate the resonances using real energy .",
    "i prefer to choosing the latter , since the treatment of certain observable quantities such as matrix - elements or wave - function components is much simpler with real variables .    solving the coupled equations derived from the schrdinger equation in coordinate space with the correct asymptotic behaviour of wave functions for @xmath0 , the shell structure in axially symmetric quadrupole - deformed woods - saxon potentials",
    "is studied .",
    "whereas one - particle bound levels in the deformed potential are obtained by solving the well - known eigenvalue problem , for positive - energy one - particle levels all eigenphases for a given @xmath5 are calculated , and the possible one - particle resonant level for a given energy @xmath20 and a given @xmath5 value may be identified , which is associated with a particular eigenphase among all possible eigenphases . one - particle resonance is not obtained if none of calculated eigenphases do not increase through @xmath21 as the one - particle energy increases at the given energy . the relevant formulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the woods - saxon potential are chosen as follows : the diffuseness @xmath22= 0.67 fm and the radius @xmath23 with @xmath24=1.27 fm , while the depth which depends on the neutron excess in respective nuclei is taken approximately from the expression ( 2 - 182 ) in @xcite .",
    "the neutron potential for nuclei with a neutron excess is shallower than that for @xmath25 nuclei .",
    "the analysis of observed spectroscopic properties of low - lying states in light deformed mirror nuclei , @xmath26mg@xmath27 and @xmath28al@xmath29 , in terms of one - particle motion in a deformed potential is very successful @xcite using the deformation parameter @xmath30 . in @xcite",
    "the nilsson diagram based on a modified oscillator potential is used . since the neutron separation energy @xmath31 of @xmath32 mg is 7.3 mev , the properties of low - lying levels",
    "could well be described using modified oscillator potential when the related parameters were properly adjusted . in figure 1",
    "the nilsson diagram based on a deformed woods - saxon potential is shown .",
    "observed spectroscopic properties of low - lying states are equally well understood also using the nilsson diagram in figure 1 .    at @xmath33=0 of figure 1",
    "the @xmath16 level appears around the middle of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 level , as usually assumed .",
    "a striking difference of figure 1 from the nilsson diagram based on the modified oscillator potential ( or from one - particle energies used in the conventional shell model ) is seen in the energies of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 levels .",
    "calculated one - particle resonant energies are @xmath36 = + 0.31 mev and @xmath37 = + 0.32 mev .",
    "namely , the @xmath38 level lies even lower than the @xmath39 level . in other words",
    ", the @xmath40=28 energy gap totally disappears in the low - energy resonance spectra .      in figure 2 the nilsson diagram appropriate for neutrons in @xmath41ne@xmath42 ,",
    "of which the measured neutron separation energy @xmath31 is 0.29@xmath431.64 mev , is shown . at @xmath33=0",
    "the @xmath39 one - neutron resonance is found at 2.04 mev , while neither @xmath38 nor @xmath44 resonance defined by the eigenphase formalism is obtained .",
    "however , the @xmath38 resonance lying clearly lower than the @xmath39 resonance is found if we use a slightly more attractive woods - saxon potential .",
    "the next low - lying one - particle resonant level for @xmath33=0 is the @xmath45 level at 9.50 mev .",
    "the measured very low excitation - energies of the first 2@xmath12 state of both @xmath46ne and @xmath47ne indicate that the ne isotope with the neutron numbers is deformed .",
    "furthermore , the large coulomb breakup cross section reported in @xcite clearly suggests the halo nature of the ground state of @xmath48ne . in the conventional shell model the 21st neutron for a spherical shape occupies the @xmath35 shell and , thus",
    ", the related halo phenomena are impossible to obtain .",
    "if @xmath48ne is prolately deformed , from figure 2 we obtain the bound nilsson level which is to be occupied by the 21st neutron having a halo structure : [ 330 1/2 ] for @xmath49 and [ 321 3/2]for @xmath50 . in both cases",
    "the ground state should have 3/2@xmath7 and the @xmath51-wave neutron halo together with the deformed core @xmath46ne .",
    "the measurement of @xmath31 with an accuracy which is an order of magnitude better than the presently available one will clarify the intrinsic configuration of the ground state of @xmath48ne @xcite .    examining figure 2",
    "we may also note that the presence of @xmath48ne inside the neutron drip line is possibly realized by the deformation , which is created by the jahn - teller effect due to the near degeneracy of @xmath35 , @xmath34 and @xmath52 shells in the continuum for the spherical shape .",
    "furthermore , it is remarked that the measured magnetic moment of the isotone nucleus @xmath53mg@xmath42 @xcite is in good agreement with the estimated value for the prolately deformed shape @xcite .      in figure 3 the nilsson diagram appropriate for neutron - drip - line nuclei with @xmath2 ( for example , @xmath56cr@xmath57 )",
    "is shown . since in this example the @xmath35 , @xmath34 , @xmath58 and @xmath52 levels",
    "are well bound , the presence of the magic number @xmath59 which is established for stable nuclei is clearly seen . moreover ,",
    "the level order of four levels in the @xmath60 major shell is exactly what is used in traditional shell - model calculations .",
    "in contrast , we note the peculiar order of weakly - bound and resonant one - particle levels which belong to the @xmath19 major shell . at @xmath61",
    "the very weakly bound @xmath62 level is almost degenerate with ( but slightly lower than ) the @xmath63 level , and the one - particle resonant levels in the @xmath19 major shell which are not plotted in the figure are : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is noted that the level order in the major shell consisting of the @xmath62 , @xmath66 , @xmath63 @xmath67 , and @xmath68 levels is totally different from what is known from stable nuclei .    a similarity of the level bunching around @xmath40=21 in figure 2 to that around @xmath40=51 in figure 3 as a function of deformation is seen especially for @xmath69 .",
    "considering the fact that the @xmath40=21 neutron - drip - line nuclei , @xmath48ne and @xmath70 mg , are deformed , the nucleus such as @xmath56cr@xmath57 may be also deformed , if it indeed lies inside the neutron drip line .",
    "in other words , there might be @xmath71 nuclei such that they may remain inside the neutron drip line due to the possible deformation .",
    "furthermore , instead of having @xmath72 = 7/2@xmath12 or 5/2@xmath12 coming from the occupancy of @xmath67 or @xmath63 neutron orbits , respectively , by the 51st neutron the neutron - drip - line nuclei with @xmath71 have a good chance to have the ground or very low - lying @xmath72 = 1/2@xmath12 state , irrespective of spherical or deformed shape .",
    "it is known that the presence of the surface in realistic potentials of stable nuclei pushes down one - particle levels with higher @xmath3 relative to lower @xmath3 levels among the levels belonging to a given major shell of the harmonic - oscillator potential . on the other hand ,",
    "weakly - bound neutrons with small @xmath3 have an appreciable probability of being outside the potential compared with those with larger @xmath3 and thus are insensitive to the strength of the potential .",
    "consequently , those small-@xmath3 levels are pushed down relative to high-@xmath3 levels , as the binding energy becomes small .",
    "the resulting shell structure , which is quite different from what we are accustomed to in stable nuclei , would appear in weakly - bound and resonant neutron one - particle levels and affect the nuclear many - body problem in neutron drip line nuclei . in the present talk",
    "i have chosen to demonstrate the shell structure of one - particle levels in the @xmath73-@xmath74 shell as well as in the @xmath19 major shell , when the levels become weakly - bound or resonant .",
    "examining the obtained shell structure one may understand the possible origin of the deformation of nuclei in the island of inversion ( @xmath1 ) as well as a possible deformation of neutron drip line nuclei with @xmath2 .    the systematic change of shell structure described in the present article is strictly related to the characteristic behavior of the one - particle motion with small orbital angular - momenta .",
    "the change can not be estimated by using harmonic - oscillator potential ( or wave function ) . in the present meeting",
    "the change of shell structure of neutrons ( protons ) as the proton ( neutron ) number varies is discussed , considering the tensor force between protons and neutrons using harmonic - oscillator wave functions .",
    "though some of the shell - structure change looks numerically similar to that shown in the present work , the relevant physics is essentially different .",
