    "the process of crumpling is everywhere in nature and human activities , including the formation of mountains and valleys in tectonics@xcite , packing of dna strands in viruses@xcite , car wreckage after an accident@xcite , or the noisy food wraps that drive us nut in the theater , etc .. in spite of its ubiquity , the mechanism behind many of its properties has remained unclear@xcite .",
    "for instance , how does the labyrinthian internal structure evolve such that it can withstand extraordinary pressure while more than 80% of its interior remains vacant ?",
    "also , why is it that there exists a power law between the external force and the sphere radius with an exponent that varies with material@xcite but , otherwise , is insensitive to the thickness and size of the thin sheet ?",
    "scientists have studied crumpled wires ( cw ) both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite . as is shown in fig.[fig :",

    "_ offered the associated morphological phase diagram and reported a power law for the number of loops with different exponents in each morphology@xcite .",
    "however , there are still few quantitative studies of cw either on the energy aspect or macroscopic properties .",
    "furthermore , the former authors all worked on stuffing the wire into a fixed two - dimensional cavity .",
    "it is not clear whether this shares the same properties as by increasing the strength of the confining potential while fixing the wire length . aside from this",
    ", another motivation for us is to check how sensitive is the cw on the specific form and relative amplitude of stretching and bending energies . in this report",
    ", simulations are carried out to study the mechanical properties of cw under the semiflexible polymer model@xcite and the minimal energy model@xcite . to prevent the entropy from dominating the statistical behavior@xcite ,",
    "the wire is chosen to be of medium length .",
    "in our simulations , the optimal shape of a wire is obtained by minimizing the total energy of cw .",
    "we begin with a wire in a weak external field , and gradually increase the field strength . at each stage with a certain field strength , we recursively minimize the energy and move to the next stage with a larger external field after an equilibrium state has been achieved .",
    "this process is carried out throughout the whole simulation until the wire structure no longer changes with the increasing external field .",
    "the wire consists of _ n _ number of monomers and is of length @xmath4 .",
    "the total energy of a cw includes bending energy @xmath5 , stretching energy @xmath6 , and external potential @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , a hard - core potential @xmath8 is incorporated to keep the wire from self - crossing .",
    "explicitly , the energy function can be written as : @xmath9+e_{hc } \\label{eq : model}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the bending angle between two successive segments and @xmath11 is the bending rigidity which is proportional to the young s modulus @xmath12 and second moment of inertia @xmath13 .",
    "the stretching modulus @xmath14 depends on the wire cross section @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the deviation of the @xmath17-th segment from its equilibrium length @xmath18 .",
    "the distance @xmath19 of the _ i_-th monomer is measured from the the center of the external parabolic potential . since most research interests fall into cases with insignificant extension , we mainly focused on conditions that @xmath20 .",
    "typical parameters for simulations are listed in tab .",
    "[ tb : parameter ] .",
    "the steady state of cw is determined by minimizing its total energy with powell s algorithm . to make sure that the local minimum we found was not a special case",
    ", we adopted a random set of searching directions in the powell s algorithm and repeated the simulations for ten times to get the averaged results .",
    "most of the time , cw are randomly folded rather than forming a perfect spiral - the apparent global minimum@xcite .",
    "this indicates that those folded configurations are metastable states .",

    "the configuration of cw is characteristically smooth , and so we exclude the temperature effect in this simulation .",
    "we believe the smoothness is credited to the stretching force which causes the relaxation of roughness , analogous to the surface tension which disfavors a kinky surface . because the stretching energy is found to be insignificant when @xmath21 , we can neglect it when determining the mathematical form of the configuration . for simplicity and without the loss of generality",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath22 , i.e. , the continuous limit .",

    "the euler - lagrange equation of motion immediately gives out the shape function as @xmath27 , where the @xmath28 term is not hard to expect by the dimensional analysis in retrospect .",
    "this matches the pattern in the initial stage of the crumpling observed experimentally@xcite as well as in our simulations .",

    "the radius of the circle is rescaled by @xmath29 .",
    "apparently , all mass will already be included in the circle when @xmath30 .",
    "the rescaling process only shifts the data on a log - log plot and does not affect the value of exponent @xmath0 .",
    "since we set the origin of the circle at the center of mass of the cw , there is a bias in the data at small r. this bias is avoided by fitting only from @xmath31=0.5 to @xmath31=1 as shown by the solid straight line@xcite.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    the mass function @xmath32 is a common property@xcite to characterize the configuration of cw .",

    "the mass - size relation is computed and shown in fig.[fig : rmdemon ] for six distinct combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we can see that the mass of cw grows in a power - law fashion when the radius increases and , disregarding@xcite the fluctuations at small external field , the growing exponent saturates at @xmath42 for @xmath43 , see fig.[fig : rmdemon ] .",
    "the saturating behavior is in accordance with donato _",
    "s conjecture@xcite that in a loose - packing situation the corresponding mass - size exponent has insignificant dependence on how the wires are injected .",

    "s result .",
    "we characterize the allocation of elastic energies in cw by the ratio @xmath44=@xmath45 .",

    "[ fig : energy ] establish a scaling relation between @xmath44 and the three parameters in the hamiltonian as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the numerical results can be deduced analytically .",
    "these exponents can be obtained by doing a dimensional analysis on the bending energy and the external potential in eq.([eq : lagrangian ] ) , @xmath50 , which gives the characteristic size for each loop as @xmath51 .",
    "multiplying the bending energy stored in each loop , @xmath52 , by the number of loops @xmath53 enable us to estimate the bending energy as @xmath54 .",
    "in a similar fashion , the stretching energy can be written as @xmath55 .",

    "notice that the power - law can only be found for strong external field ( @xmath65 ) .",

    "for instance , what is the main reason why such a loose crumpled structure can be so hard ? as a starting point , people has studied the power law between the structure size and the applied force both experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",
    "our simulation result in fig.[fig : size ] showed that the radius of gyration @xmath69 of cw decreases with @xmath70 in a power - law form . to prevent the structure from becoming too complicated , we limit the field strength @xmath70 at 2000 to optimize the resolution and accuracy .",
    "the data are found to collape into the scaling relation @xmath71 , which suggests that the stretching energy not only correlates those monomers , but also contributes to the stiffness .",
    "intuitively , the dependence of @xmath41 is expected to drop out instead of diverging as it approaches infinity .",
    "the reason why we obtained such a scaling relation is a consequence of the discrete model since the length of monomers is bound to be compressed as they all scramble to be near the center of the external potential .    in fig.[fig :",
    "size ] , @xmath72 is determined to be independent of @xmath63 and @xmath64 and , consequently , the thickness and young s modulus of the wire .",
    "this result is the same as the predictions made for an elastic thin sheet@xcite .",
    "it can be derived analytically by minimizing with respect to @xmath31 the sum of the external potential , @xmath73 , and the total repulsive interaction , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a measure of the hard - core potential , @xmath76 is the monomer density , and the other @xmath77 factor comes from integrating over the cavity .    since stoop _",
    "_ has demonstrated the importance of plasticity for cw , we also include it in our simulation .",
    "the bending rigidity @xmath63 is revised with a linear approximation , @xmath78 in the plastic regime , so that the bending energy becomes @xmath79 when @xmath80 is larger than the yield threshold angle @xmath3@xcite .",

    "it also decays exponentially with the yield threshold @xmath3 . when large deformations cost less energy due to the plasticity , they appear in abundance and cause many vertex - like structures which makes the cw stiffer .    -@xmath81 relation of the cws(@xmath85 ) with plasticity for different @xmath2 which are denoted in the figure .",
