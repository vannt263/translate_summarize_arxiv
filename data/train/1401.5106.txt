    ", we take the vaidya - ads@xmath7 spacetime as the gravity background . in the gravity",
    "dual , thermalization is realized by the gravitational collapse and the subsequent black hole formation .",
    "the vaidya - ads metric is one of the simplest geometry of this kind , obtained for instance as a result of planar - shell collapse  @xcite or the collapse of null dust .",
    "this collapse in the bulk gravity will be identified with a spatially - homogeneous injection of a fixed amount of energy per unit volume in the boundary field theory .",
    "we focus on the simplest case of the vaidya - ads metric to clarify basic aspects of the dynamical behaviors of the holographic mesons , though in general we could consider more complicated thermalization patterns such as those realized by local heating caused by point particle infalling into the bulk black hole  @xcite or an anisotropic wake induced by a time - dependent deformation of the boundary metric  @xcite .",
    "the thermalization time scale is typically fast for the vaidya - ads metric  @xcite , and hence it would be suitable to focus on the effect of rapid thermalization .",
    "the time evolution we consider is sketched as follows . in the vaidya - ads@xmath7 spacetime , it is convenient to use the ingoing eddington - finkelstein time @xmath8 as the bulk time coordinate , and @xmath8 coincides with the time of the field theory at the ads boundary .",
    "initially for @xmath9 , the spacetime is locally pure ads .",
    "we then inject energy from the ads boundary at @xmath10 to form the black hole that settles down to the schwarzschild - ads@xmath11 black hole in the final state .",
    "the initial static embedding of the d7-brane before the energy injection is given by the analytic solution in the pure ads spacetime .",

    ", width=151 ]    here , we would like to emphasize subtleties in treating dynamical backgrounds of this kind .",
    "when we discuss non - stationary phenomena in the gravity dual description , especially when the event horizon exists , we should pay careful attention to the causality and non - uniqueness of the time foliation of the bulk spacetime , unlikely to static or stationary cases . in our study , such subtleties associated with",
    "the bulk causality become manifest when we try to answer questions such as the following :    * how should we determine the phase of the brane embeddings at a given time ? * how can we know the moment at which the phase transition takes place in the boundary theory ?    in static cases , the former question becomes almost trivial : we can distinguish the bh and minkowski embeddings just by seeing whether the brane intersects with the event horizon or not .",
    "in general dynamical cases , however , this naive consideration is no longer suitable .",
    "firstly , there is no definitely preferred time foliation , and this fact implies that the brane configuration at a given bulk time depends on bulk time foliation and is not unique .",
    "in addition , the part of the brane world - volume captured in the event horizon can not be observed by any observers outside the black hole , since that part lies in the causal future of those observers .",
    "the information of that part does not affect the dynamics of the other part of the brane outside the black hole , as well as time - dependent boundary observables determined by the brane dynamics .",
    "this observation tells us that some naive notions based on the static cases are no longer rigorous in the dynamical cases .",
    "we address this issue in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . in the gauge / gravity duality , it is the dual boundary operators that contains information of the boundary field theory . in our study , we will compute the time evolution of the operators by solving the equation of the motion of the brane .",
    "this approach guarantees that the results are not affected by bulk time foliations .",
    "below , we summarize properties of the dynamical d7-brane embeddings clarified by our numerical analysis .",
    "our model possesses two parameters , which are the final black hole mass and the mass injection speed .",
    "we find there are three cases of the dynamical d7-brane embeddings depending on these parameters .",
    "two of them are analogous to static embeddings .",
    "if the final black hole mass is sufficiently small , the brane never intersects with the event horizon , and the embedding is the minkowski embedding with non - decaying oscillations . in the dual field theory , the quark condensate @xmath13 oscillates around the equilibrium value",
    "this is the sub - critical case in which the phase transition does not occur since the final temperature is sufficiently low .",
    "if the final mass is sufficiently large , the brane intersects with the horizon , and relaxes to the black hole embedding .",
    "this is the super - critical case in which the final temperature is sufficiently high for the phase transition to occur and the mesons are melting .",
    "we find that another kind of dynamical embedding appears when the final black hole mass is slightly smaller than the phase transition value .",
    "there is no static bh embeddings in this regime .",
    "despite this fact , the brane dynamically touches the horizon if the injection is sufficiently fast : the rapid injection induces a large brane motion , and it drives the brane into the horizon . roughly speaking",
    ", a part of the brane falls into the black hole because of inertia .",
    "we call it the _ overeager case _ since the brane is made `` overeager '' to plunge into the black hole under the influence of the dynamical environment .    after intersecting , the brane configuration on constant @xmath8 surfaces moves in order to escape from the bulk black hole since the final equilibrium configuration in the future can not be the black hole embedding .",
    "the brane configuration , however , tends to be singular within a finite time as the intersection locus approaches the pole where the @xmath14 wrapped by the d7-brane shrinks to zero size .",
    "it is expected that if stringy or quantum effects are taken into account there , the brane will reconnect near that locus , and then go back to the minkowski embedding .",
