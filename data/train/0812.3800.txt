    "the interest in alkaline earth systems has increased significantly over the past years .",
    "one of the main interests in these systems is their applications to high resolution spectroscopy and atomic frequency standards , as they offer very narrow electronic transitions @xcite .",
    "another attractive feature of the two - electron systems is their very simple energy level structure , for bosonic isotopes , free of both fine and hyperfine structure .",
    "this simple structure opens for detailed comparison between theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "recent advances in _ ab initio _",
    "relativistic many - body calculations of two - electron systems have provided very accurate values for atomic structure and properties such as the electric - dipole transitions of mg , ca , and sr@xcite . however , in the case of mg relatively few experiments have been reported in literature motivating the studies in this brief report .",
    "+ in a series of papers two photon cooling in ladder schemes have been proposed to lower the temperature below the doppler limit of alkaline earth elements @xcite .",
    "the magnesium and calcium systems are of particular interest since cooling is limited to a few mk .",
    "experimental evidence for two - photon cooling has been established , but the effect is rather modest contrary to theoretical predictions @xcite . one important mechanism to take into account in these studies are leaks from the ladder system , limiting the number of atoms that eventually can be cooled .    in this",
    "this brief report we present the first measurements of the spin forbidden decay from the magnesium ( 3s3d)@xmath0d@xmath1 state to ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath6 and ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath1 . using atoms trapped in a magneto - optical trap",
    "we optically prepare the atoms in the ( 3s3d)@xmath0d@xmath1 state and measure the decay to ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath4 manifold by trap loss measurements .",
    "this enables us to deduce the absolute decay rate for these transitions and compare our results to state of the art theoretical calculations .",
    "d@xmath1 @xmath2 ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath4 decay measurement in @xmath5 mg . ]    in figure [ energylevels ] , we show the relevant energy levels and transitions in our experiment .",
    "the 285 nm transition is used for coolingand trapping the atoms while the 881 nm transition is used to populate the @xmath9 state . from this state the atoms",
    "may decay to the ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath6 state ( 407.6 nm ) with rate @xmath10 or to the ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath1 state ( 408.3 nm ) with rate @xmath11 , or simply back to ( 3s3p)@xmath0p@xmath6 . by neglecting decay to the ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath12 state , which is weaker by orders of magnitude , no other decay channels are open . when the 881 nm laser is switched off we express the steady state number of atoms @xmath13 as the ratio of the load rate to linear losses @xmath14 . here",
    "we neglect intra - mot collisions since we are working at relative low atom densities .",
    "the equation for the number of atoms trapped in the mot with 881 nm light present can be written as : @xmath15 experimentally we determine the total loss rate @xmath16 . in our case the linear loss rate @xmath17 is dominated by resonant photo - ionization of ( 3s3p)@xmath0p@xmath6 at 285 nm @xcite .",
    "photo - ionization from the @xmath18 level is below 1 mb and will not be considered here@xcite .",
    "the steady state becomes @xmath19 and @xmath20 the ratio of signal with 881 nm turned on and off is proportional to @xmath21 , @xmath22 respectively .",
    "we find finally @xmath23 as the @xmath17-coefficient is dominated by resonant photo - ionization and thus proportional to the fraction of atoms in the ( 3s3p)@xmath0p@xmath6 state .",
    "so far we assumed that all atoms decaying to the ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath24 manifold are lost .",
    "this is indeed the case for the ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath1 final states due to their long lifetime exceeding 2200 seconds @xcite . on the time scale of the experiment , being only a few seconds , we consider the atoms from this state lost . however , for the ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath6 states atoms in the @xmath25 magnetic sub state will be trapped in the magnetic quadrupole field of the mot and most likely be recaptured when decaying back to the ( 3s@xmath26)@xmath0s@xmath12 ground state .",
    "atoms in @xmath27 magnetic sub states are expected to be lost since the rms velocity of the trapped atoms exceed 1 m / s leading to a rms travelled distance of more than 5 mm , which is large compared to our mot beam diameter of only a few mm .",
    "the total decay rate will thus be modified to @xmath28 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath29 depend strongly on the polarization of the 285 nm beam and the 881 nm beam .",
    "if we assume a standard one dimensional model for the mot we can determine the influence of the constant @xmath29 .",
    "this is a good approximation as the 881 nm beam is directed along one of the uv mot beams , but not retro reflected .",
    "consider atoms on the @xmath30 side , see figure [ repumping ] .",
    "these atoms will mainly populate the @xmath31 state .",
    "further excitation of the collinear 881 nm laser will drive the atoms to the left ( blue line ) or right ( red line ) depending on the helicity of the 881 nm laser .",
    "this creates an anisotropy in the decay to the ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath6 state .",
    "atoms driven along the blue line , i.e. , with same polarization helicity as the mot beams , will only populate non - trapped states .",
    "experiments performed in this configurations is thus insensitive to the re - trapping dynamics as described above .",
    "using the clebsch gordan coefficients shown in figure [ repumping ] we find the rate @xmath32 , as expected . for the opposite polarization",
    "we find a reduction @xmath33 .",
    "we now consider a more general case where all three magnetic sub states @xmath34 are populated .",
    "the populations are denoted @xmath35 @xmath36 and with @xmath37 .",
    "we find the effective decay constant as @xmath38 for mot polarization .",
    "the @xmath35 coefficient is expected to be small compared to the sum of the two other terms .",
    "however , even in an extreme case where all sub states are populated equally @xmath10 is effected only by about 5% .",
    "@xmath2 ( 3s3p)@xmath3p@xmath6 decay . ]    with a 881 nm helicity opposite to that of the mot beam , marked in red color on figure [ repumping ] , will ultimately result in a destruction of the trapping force as the 881 nm laser intensity increases .",
    "this effect is expected as a result of destructive reshuffling of the atoms into `` wrong '' magnetic sub states .",
    "this ensures a maximal transfer of population to the @xmath9 . left part of the figure",

    "this we use to lock the 881 nm laser frequency close to the two photon resonance @xmath40100 mhz during the experiments , see figure [ lock ] . increasing the rabi frequency of the 881 nm light causes a minor change in the locking point . in our power range",
    "this corresponds to about 1 mhz and not considered important at this level of accuracy .",
    "typically 10@xmath41 atoms are captured in the mot , with a rms diameter of 1 mm and temperatures from 3 to 5 mk .",
    "the doppler cooling limit for the mot is 2 mk as sub - doppler cooling is not supported in this system .",
    "the number of emitted 285 nm photons when the ir laser was on and off respectively , was measured for each of the two circular polarizations states .",
