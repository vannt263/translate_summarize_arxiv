    "an issue that has attracted considerable attention recently and that is associated to the perturbation theory breakdown problem is the study of how interactions alter the critical temperature ( @xmath11 ) of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) . due to its nonperturbative nature , this is clearly a non - trivial problem .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were able to show that the transition temperature for a dilute , homogeneous , three dimensional bose gas can be expressed at next to leading order as    @xmath12 a^2 n^{2/3 } + { \\cal o } \\left(a^3 n \\right)\\ ; , \\label { exptc}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the ideal gas critical temperature , @xmath7 is the @xmath8-wave scattering length and @xmath9 the number density .",
    "a similar structure is also discussed in ref .",
    "as far as the numerical coefficients are concerned , the exact value , @xmath14 , was obtained using perturbation theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the other two coefficients , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are sensitive to the infrared sector of the theory and consequently can not be obtained perturbatively , but they can , through a matching calculation , be expressed in terms of the two nonperturbative quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 which are , respectively , related to the number density and to the critical chemical potential , as discussed in the next section .",
    "some early analytical predictions for @xmath15 included the self - consistent resummation schemes ( @xmath19 ) @xcite , the @xmath1 expansion at leading order ( @xmath20 ) @xcite and at next to leading order ( @xmath21 ) @xcite and also the linear @xmath22 expansion ( lde ) at second order ( @xmath23 ) @xcite . today",
    "the most precise values predict @xmath24 as shown by the lattice ( monte carlo ) simulations which produce @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite whereas very recent analytical studies , up to seven loop , predict @xmath27 ( variational perturbation theory , @xcite ) and @xmath28 ( improved lde , @xcite ) . a clear review of all how those methods apply to the problem can be found in ref .",
    "at the same time , the order-@xmath5 non - perturbative coefficient , @xmath16 , has not been considered by most authors working on the bec @xmath6 problem . at this point",
    "it is worth recalling that while @xmath15 is a function only of @xmath17 , which is related to the number density , @xmath16 is a function of @xmath17 as well as @xmath18 , which is related to the critical chemical potential .",
    "this coefficient was first evaluated with lattice simulations which predict @xmath29 for @xmath10 @xcite and a previous analytical evaluation made use of the standard lde @xcite as well as its recently improved version @xcite . the best previous analytical results ( in comparison to the lattice ones )",
    "were produced with the improved lde which obtains @xmath30 at order-@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "very recently , the highest presently available ( seven - loop order ) perturbative contributions and a corresponding new evaluation of @xmath18 within the framework of the above mentioned variational perturbation theory , has been performed by kastening @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we use the traditional @xmath1 expansion to evaluate analytically , in the large-@xmath2 limit , the above mentioned quantity @xmath32 .",
    "this large @xmath2 result is a useful cross - check of a similar evaluation also presented very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , since our independent calculation is performed in a quite different way , as discussed in detail below . using this result in conjunction with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the density number one may finally establish the analytical large-@xmath2 prediction for @xmath16 at the next - to - leading @xmath1 order . comparing our large-@xmath2 results for @xmath4 with the ones produced by the lattice simulations we show how the @xmath1 approximation performs very well , already at the first non trivial order , even for the homogeneous bose gas case where @xmath10 .",
    "second , by considering our @xmath1 result as being ",
    "exact \" we perform standard as well as improved ( lde ) optimized perturbative evaluations of @xmath18 ( or equivalently @xmath4 ) , also at the @xmath1 order , so that the convergence and reliability of such a method in the bec context can be further tested . as we recall below",
    ", the lde method essentially introduces a mass term within the effective scalar field model , therefore avoiding the above mentioned infrared divergence problems of ordinary perturbation theory .",
    "then , the interest of considering lde in the large-@xmath2 limit is that at the relevant ( next - to - leading ) @xmath1 order we can define and calculate the lde perturbative series to _ arbitrary _ orders for the quantity @xmath3 , and thus check the convergence of the lde method in principle to arbitrary orders .",
    "our optimized perturbation analysis , in the large-@xmath2 limit , shows how the improved versions of this method also perform very well in connection with the @xmath6 problem .",
    "+ this work is organized as follows . in the next section we briefly recall the effective model which is considered throughout the paper . in section iii",
    "we perform the exact analytical evaluation at @xmath1 order of the critical chemical potential .",
    "section iv is devoted to the optimized perturbation ( lde ) applications both for the large-@xmath2 as well as the finite @xmath2 case .",
    "we pay special attention to the convergence problem .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "the studies concerning the equilibrium properties of bec can be addressed by means of a non - relativistic effective theory described by a complex scalar field . in the dilute limit , which is the regime involved in those experiments , only two - body interactions are important @xcite and one",
    "may then consider the following @xmath33 invariant finite temperature euclidean action    @xmath34 ^ 2 \\right\\}\\ ; , \\label{se}\\ ] ]    where , in natural units , @xmath35 is the inverse of the temperature , @xmath36 is the chemical potential and @xmath37 the mass of the atoms . at the relevant low temperatures involved in bec the internal degrees of freedom are unimportant and this can be taken as an effective model of hard core spheres with local interactions for which @xmath7 represents the @xmath8-wave scattering length .",
    "the field @xmath38 can be decomposed into imaginary - time frequency modes @xmath39 , with discrete bosonic matsubara frequencies @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is an integer .",
    "near the transition the chemical potential becomes very small as compared to the temperature ( @xmath42 ) and , since the correlation length tends to infinity , the distances are large compared to the thermal wavelength @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , only the zero modes matter and one may integrate out all other modes to obtain an effective three - dimensional scalar action with an @xmath44 symmetry , given by @xcite @xmath45 \\ ; , \\label{action2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in the large-@xmath2 limit mainly considered in this work , and also in refs .",

    "as discussed below , the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath56 comes from the hugenholtz - pines ( hp ) theorem at the critical point . as a matter of fact ,",

    "this shows that perturbation theory is clearly inadequate to treat the bec problem at the transition due to the presence of infrared divergences .",
    "one must then reccur to nonperturbative methods like the numerical lattice monte carlo simulations ( ls ) , the analytical @xmath1 technique or the lde @xcite ( see for instance refs . @xcite for different types of applications ) .",
    "the problem is highly nontrivial since the hugenholtz - pines theorem automatically washes out all momentum independent contributions , such as the one - loop tadpole diagrams , which constitute the leading order of most approximations . in practice",
    ", this means that the first nontrivial contributions start with two - loop momentum dependent self - energy terms .",
    "however , having reduced the original model , eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) , to the effective three - dimensional one , eq .",
    "( [ action2 ] ) , makes it easier to tackle those contributions since one no longer has the problem of summing over the matsubara s frequencies , which is a hard task when the number of loops increases .    here ,",
    "as stated in the introduction , our aim is to apply the @xmath1 expansion and the lde to eq .",
    "( [ action2 ] ) to explicitly evaluate the quantity @xmath69 ( @xmath37 being the relevant atom mass ) , comparing our results with the the lattice simulation prediction which , for @xmath10 , is @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "the large-@xmath2 evaluation is carried out , as usual , by assigning a factor of @xmath2 to any closed loop , and considering @xmath71 .",
    "then for the massless critical theory given by eq .",
    "( [ action2 ] ) the first non trivial contributions are at the next - to - leading order @xmath1 , and come from the tadpole ( with bubble insertions ) type of graphs ( see figure 1 ) :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 with the  dressed \" ( resummed ) scalar propagator    @xmath74    where    @xmath75    represents the basic one - loop @xmath76-dimensional ( massless ) integral .",
    "the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ basm0 ] ) can be done exactly and most conveniently in dimensional regularization .",
    "actually , up to a trivial factor of @xmath77 , it is exactly the same two - loop integral entering the exact evaluation of @xmath78 at the @xmath1 order , thus already performed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also appendix a of ref .",

    "however , is not finite in three dimensions and has therefore to be regularized and renormalized .",
    "although it turns out to be a technically rather standard two - loop calculation in dimensional regularization , we shall give it in some details below since , to the best of our knowledge , it has not been done before .",
    "due to the non - finiteness of the final result one should use the arbitrary @xmath76-dimensional result for the propagator in eq .",

    "this is of course expected , since the divergence has a perturbative origin and arises solely from the setting sun graph , namely the order @xmath97 in a formal perturbative expansion of expression ( [ sigma ] ) ( see also fig .",

    "( [ rcnex ] ) , as well as the explicitly non - perturbative dependence on the coupling @xmath54 therein .    for @xmath10 and @xmath98",

    "the lde can be implemented in the bec case by considering the interpolated action @xmath103 \\ ; , \\label{actiondel}\\ ] ] which interpolates between a free theory ( @xmath104 ) and the original interacting theory ( @xmath105 ) @xcite . any physical quantity ( @xmath106 )",
    "is then evaluated and renormalized exactly at some perturbative order by treating the dummy parameter ( @xmath22 ) as a small number and @xmath107 as an arbitrary mass parameter to be fixed later . at the end ,",
    "one sets @xmath108 .",
    "while the @xmath109 is treated as a new quadratic vertex , the other part is absorbed by the propagator which is now naturally infrared regulated by the mass term .",
    "accordingly , the lde amounts in a first stage to perform an order by order perturbative calculation of the relevant green s functions ( here the self - energy contributions @xmath56 ) but in the massive theory as defined by eq .",
    "( [ actiondel ] ) .",
    "thus , any finite order perturbative calculation will produce @xmath107-dependent physical quantities .",
    "to get rid of this unwanted dependence one usually demands that @xmath106 has its optimum value at the point where it is less sensitive to @xmath107 : @xmath110 according to the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite to which we shall refer as ordinary pms ( opms ) .",
    "however , we shall also consider below some specific variations of this method that had been more recently developed@xcite , which in practice essentially introduce some additional arbitrary variational parameters .",

    "the feynman rules for the interpolated theory , in euclidean space , are @xmath112 , @xmath109 and @xmath113 , for the quadratic vertices and @xmath114 for the quartic vertex while the propagator is given by @xmath115^{-1 } \\;\\;.\\ ] ]      to make this paper self contained let us briefly recall how the lde is employed in the evaluation of @xmath3 by redoing the step by step evaluation performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we shall stay within the large-@xmath2 limit only , while the evaluation performed in ref .",
    "@xcite was carried out for any value of @xmath2 . according to the hp theorem , applied in conjunction with the lde @xcite",
    ", @xmath116 is obtained from the perturbative evaluation of self energy diagrams , @xmath117 . to order-@xmath22",
    "one has only the plain tadpole contribution and a direct application of the feynman rules for the interpolated theory and dimensional regularization ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) gives , in the large-@xmath2 limit , the finite contribution @xmath118 carrying on to order-@xmath119 , still within the large-@xmath2 limit , one must consider @xcite    @xmath120    where @xmath121 must be expanded accordingly .",
    "now , one replaces @xmath122 appearing in the right hand side of the above equation , with the value @xmath123 obtained at the previous order so that the right hand side _ remains _ of order-@xmath119 .",
    "then , one can see how the ",
    "double - scoop \" contribution ( third term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ delrc ] ) ) is exactly canceled due to the hp condition applied to @xmath3 at first order .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that at any higher order ( @xmath9 ) all large-@xmath2 contributions of order-@xmath124 , with @xmath125 cancel .",
    "therefore to get non trivial results with the lde one must add the next - to - leading order , @xmath126 terms , shown in figure 1 , to eq .",
    "( [ tad ] ) .",
    "the first comes from the  setting - sun \" contribution ( see left - hand - side of equality in figure 2 ) , which has been explicitly evaluated by braaten and nieto @xcite and also in ref .",
    "@xcite giving    @xmath127 \\;.\\ ] ]    as already mentioned at the end of section iii , this contribution displays an ultraviolet pole as @xmath128 ( @xmath85 ) which is , within dimensional regularization , the only primitive ultraviolet divergence associated with the effective super - renormalizable three - dimensional theory .",
    "the pole produced by this primitive divergence fixes the mass counterterm coefficient in the @xmath129 scheme @xmath130 as usual , this ",
    "vertex \" must be considered also at higher orders so diagrams whose divergences arise from  setting - sun \" sub - diagrams maybe rendered finite .",
    "one then gets the finite second order result @xmath131 \\;\\;. \\label{delrcrenor}\\ ] ] note that contrary to the original massless case , the massive lde interpolated action allows for the unique plain tadpole contribution , given by eq .",
    "( [ tad ] ) , to survive at any order .",
    "this @xmath132 term must then appear together with all @xmath133 non trivial terms shown in figures 1 , 2 .",
    "in fact , as far as the lde is concerned , the linear term is crucial for convergence properties @xcite .",
    "finally , the relation between the values of @xmath134 evaluated at two different ( @xmath129 ) mass scales , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , can be readily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ delrcrenor ] ) and reads @xmath137 it is not too difficult to see that this relation will be verified at any order in @xmath22 . at order-@xmath119",
    "the only diagram which is scale dependent is the  setting sun \" . at a higher order ( @xmath138 ) this order-@xmath119 type of contribution can appear only as a subdiagram ( @xmath139 ) . at the same order a similar graph appears , but this time @xmath122 replaces the setting sun insertion .",
    "however , the  vertex \" @xmath122 is always replaced by its expansion in @xmath22 which contains , at order-@xmath119 , exactly the same scale dependent term as given by the setting sun with zero external momentum ( @xmath140 ) , with a reversed sign producing a net combination proportional to @xmath141 which , in three dimensions , turns out to be scale independent @xcite .",
    "this means that , apart from the order-@xmath119 setting sun , all contributions to @xmath142 are automatically scale independent . this perturbative procedure , to order-@xmath143 is clearly illustrated in ref . @xcite . in the present work we are interested in the large-@xmath2 limit",
    "only so it is easier to add up the whole series ( represented by the diagrams of figures 1 and 2 ) in a closed form and then develop it to the desired order in @xmath22 as illustrated in the next subsection .      as shown in the previous subsection ,",
    "a main difference between the lde and the exact large-@xmath2 above calculation is that with the former one considers a massive theory , which effectively introduces a mass term in the ( dressed ) propagator .",
    "so , for practical reasons the lde evaluation can be performed as discussed in the previous sub - section or alternatively as we do now .",
    "having defined the relevant perturbative series in powers of @xmath54 for the massive case , we can proceed to the usual ordinary pms ( opms ) or its improved version ( ipms ) .",
    "accordingly , we apply on the latter series the substitutions : @xmath144 in the standard opms - lde @xcite , or @xmath145^{1/2}\\;;\\;\\;\\ ;   u\\to u\\ , \\delta \\;\\ ; , \\label{subst2}\\ ] ] and subsequent generalizations in the ipms - lde @xcite .",
    "the difference between the opms and the ipms is basically that within the latter one introduces more arbitrary interpolation parameters at each successive perturbative order such that the pms criterion is generalized by requiring @xmath146 , @xmath147 , etc .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the ipms essentially reduces a basic problem concerning the opms .",
    "in fact , as discussed in many bec applications @xcite , at high orders the opms generates many possible ( complex ) optimum values . on the other hand ,",
    "the ipms produces , in general , a unique ( real ) optimum . in the following",
    "we will compare results obtained with both methods .",
    "+ we shall also consider for completeness another variation of the lde - pms introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , that we may call a  renormalization group inspired \" interpolation .",
    "this , more precisely , modifies the simplest lde substitution formula eq .",
    "( [ subst ] ) by introducing consistently into the substitution the relevant critical exponent : @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 being the anomalous dimension of the critical propagator @xmath151 and @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the critical coupling and @xmath154 the renormalization group beta function ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and definitions of the critical exponents ) .",
    "the benefit of the latter method in the present case is that the value of the critical exponent is known exactly for large @xmath2 : @xmath155 .",
    "( incidentally , our more empirical ipms approach introducing more parameters is in practice equivalent to the latter at second order in @xmath22 , eq .",

    "however , note carefully that at the end the first term of the series will not be considered since it does not correspond to any real physical contribution being an artifact of the resummation as discussed , for an equivalent series , in ref .",

    "one can see that at first rough sight , all different pms approaches seem to perform very well , all exhibiting a numerically convergence behaviour towards the exact result as the order increases .",
    "moreover , all the results are already remarkably good at third order . in practice",
    "the ipms method , introducing one more parameter at each successive order , becomes quite cumbersome at large orders , so that we somewhat arbitrarily stopped our analysis at order twelve , beyond which it became unreasonably time consuming for our calculation ( performed with mathematica @xcite ) .",
    "when examining in more details the behavior of each different method , we first observe that the ( real part of ) the standard opms method results get very close to the exact result at larger and larger orders , letting aside the embarassing non - zero but small imaginary parts .",
    "however , in table i we have selected among several ( many at large orders ) real and complex optimal results those closest to the known exact result . nevertheless , if selecting instead only the real solutions we find a slightly less convergent series of approximations , but still quite satisfactory ( the real solutions are provided in table i , whenever they exist ) . alternatively , the ipms has the advantage that it gives at any order a unique real optimal solution , and seemingly converging somewhat more slowly but regularly towards the expected result .",
    "as far as the rgpms method is concerned , some of the optimization results appear at large orders to be even better that the two previous ones , being impressively close to the exact one as the perturbative order increases",
    ". this may be due to the fact that the known large-@xmath2 exact value @xmath180 enters this interpolation .",
    "however , the rgpms suffers a priori from the same drawback than the ordinary pms , namely that the real optimal solutions are not unique , as explicitly illustrated in the table , and we have also selected the best among many more ( mainly complex ) optimized solutions .",
    "it is interesting to remark finally that , as observed similarly in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the order increases the leading ipms parameter @xmath7 seems to approach ( though very slowly ) a critical value @xmath181 ( which , upon neglecting other higher order ipms interpolation parameters , would correspond to @xmath180 in the rgpms approach ) .",
