    "the results of approaches based on nuclear many - body theory ( nmbt ) and realistic models of the nn interaction @xcite , in which the effects of short - range correlations are taken into account , provide a satisfactory description of a large body of data @xcite .",
    "long - range correlations , leading to the excitation of collective modes , are also known to be important .",
    "they become in fact dominant in the region of low momentum transfer , in which the space resolution of the probe , @xmath2 , becomes much larger than the average nn separation .",
    "most theoretical studies of this kinematical regime have been carried out within the tamm dancoff ( td ) @xcite and random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , using effective particle - hole interactions .",
    "the development of a theoretical scheme allowing for a consistent treatment of short- and long - range correlations requires the construction of _ effective _ interactions based on _ realistic _ models of the nn force .",

    "the region of neutrino energy @xmath4  gev @xcite is relevant to the analyses of long - baseline neutrino experiments , such as k2k and miniboone ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) , while nuclear interactions of low energy neutrinos , carrying energies of the order of tens of mev , are believed to determine supernov@xmath5evolution @xcite and neutron star cooling @xcite .    the effective interaction proposed in ref.@xcite has been recently improved with the inclusion of the effects of three- and many - nucleon forces @xcite . the resulting interaction has been used to calculate the nucleon - nucleon scattering cross section in nuclear matter , needed to obtain the transport coefficients from the boltzmann - landau equation @xcite .    in this paper , we report the results of a study of the charged current weak response of symmetric nuclear matter , carried out using the effective interaction of ref.@xcite . the main purpose of our work is identifying different interaction and correlation effects , all described within the same dynamical model , and determining the kinematical regions in which they play the dominant role .",
