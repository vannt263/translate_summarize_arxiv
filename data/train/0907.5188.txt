    "more precisely , he proves this way that @xmath12 is non - trivial for @xmath13 and @xmath14 is non - trivial for @xmath15 .",

    "therefore , in section [ sec : surgery_in_families ] , we will first study how and under which conditions such constructions can be carried out . assuming that a given smooth bundle admits a fiberwise morse function , we use the surgery technique developed by walsh @xcite , which generalizes the gromov - lawson construction of psc - metrics via handle decompositions @xcite to families of morse functions , in order to construct families of psc - metrics on this bundle , see theorem [ theo : construct_metrics-1a ] .",
