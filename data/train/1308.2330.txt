    "the extended holstein model ( ehm ) was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , primarily for the explanation of smallness of charge carrier s mass in the cuprates . in the strong coupling regime ( or when the electron - phonon interaction is strong ) , the small value of ehm polaron s mass compared to that of the usual holstein model @xcite , is primarily ensured by the long - range nature of the electron - phonon interaction ( interaction via frhlich type density - displacement force ) . in the last decade ,",
    "different properties of the ehm were studied by several authors ( see review article @xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kornilovitch studied the ground state energy , effective mass and polaron spectrum with the help of the continuous - time quantum monte carlo algorithm .",
    "an anisotropy of the polaron s mass due to electron - phonon interaction , ground - state dispersion , and density of states of the ehm polaron were studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "fehske , loos and wellein @xcite investigated the electron - lattice correlations , single - particle spectral function and optical conductivity of a polaron within the ehm in the strong and weak coupling regimes by means of the lanczos diagonalization method .",
    "other properties of the ehm , such as the ground state spectral weight , the average kinetic energy and the mean number of phonons were studied in refs.@xcite by means of the variational and quantum monte carlo simulation approaches .",
    "the work of ref .",
    "@xcite extended the ehm to the adiabatic limit .",
    "the influence of the different types of polarized vibrations , and the arrangement of the ions on the mass of polaron , have been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the ehm with screened electron - phonon interactions was discussed in refs .",
    "the influence of both local and nonlocal electron - phonon interactions on the full polaronic effect within the ehm was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , finding that these interactions can compensate for each other , resulting in the suppression of polaronic effects .",
    "the ehm was used to study a polaron formation in semiconducting polymers , finding the polaron s energy , its size , and lattice deformation as a function of the conjugation length @xcite .    quite recently , one of us ( b.ya.ya . ) extended an application of the ehm to la - based cuprate films under pressure ( strained films ) @xcite .",
    "namely , in that work , a unified approach for studying the influence of pressure ( stress or strain ) on the temperature of bose - einstein condensation of intersite bipolarons was proposed .",
    "uniaxial strain derivatives of bose - einstein condensation temperature ( @xmath4 ) of intersite bipolarons were calculated .",
    "having accepted the bipolaronic scenario as a ground for high - t@xmath5 superconductivity of cuprates , the experimental results on the influence of lattice mismatch to the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) of la - based high - t@xmath5 films were explained . in particular , the results of two experiments @xcite were explained within the framework of the ehm and the bipolaronic theory of superconductivity .",
    "the main features of the model proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite are : ( i ) compressive pressure ( strain ) in the @xmath6plane of cuprates enhances @xmath4 and ( ii ) compressive pressure ( strain ) along @xmath7-axis of cuprates reduces @xmath4 .",
    "such variations of the @xmath0 of cuprates with respect to applied pressure ( strain ) are often observed @xcite .",
    "the proposed model allows one to interrelate strains in each axis with each other and to study their cumulative effect on @xmath4 .    here , we continue to study the influence of strain induced by external pressure or lattice mismatch on @xmath4 for different lattices .",
    "special attention will be given to the possibility of qualitative explanation of such phenomena as sign difference of the strain ( pressure ) derivatives of @xmath0 of rba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 cuprates ( r stands for yb , y , dy or gd ) along the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes .",
    "rba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 compounds stand apart from other cuprates ( with the cuo@xmath1 planes only ) because of the presence of cu - o chains along the @xmath10-axis in the crystal structure .",
    "strong anisotropy of crystal structure gives rise to the anisotropy of electronic , thermodynamic , transport and other properties of the rba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 family of materials .",
    "in particular , uniaxial strain derivatives of the critical temperature , @xmath0 , along crystallographic axes @xmath11 and @xmath10 have opposite sign : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the value of the uniaxial strain derivative of the critical temperature of cuprates along @xmath14 axis , @xmath15 , lies in a wide range , but all values are negative .",
    "there are several works that theoretically explain uniaxial the strain ( pressure ) derivatives of the critical temperature of rba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 cuprates @xcite .",
    "though the theoretical models ( see above works ) proposed so far were able to somehow explain the uniaxial pressure ( strain ) derivatives of @xmath0 of rba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 compounds and reproduce some aspects of the well - known experiments @xcite , they miss the important issue relevant to all cuprates .",
    "the issue is the presence of strong electron - phonon interaction in the cuprates @xcite and the polaronic nature of charge carriers @xcite .",
    "an another point is that those models are applicable to only one cuprate compound , for example to the rba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 family , and do not discuss the same problems in la- and bi - based cuprates . in this sense",
    "those models lack universality .",
    "therefore , at present , development of a model that explains the uniaxial strain ( pressure ) derivatives of @xmath0 from the universal point of view and takes into account strong electron - phonon interaction in the cuprates is one of the most important research tasks in the way of our understanding the microscopic origin of high-@xmath0 phenomena .",
    "our model , proposed in @xcite , does not suffer from the above - mentioned imperfections .",
    "below we show that the ehm and bose - einstein condensation scenario of intersite bipolarons , if one accepts the latter to be responsible for high - t@xmath5 superconductivity of cuprates , are able to qualitatively explain the sign difference of @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",

    "we work with dispersionless phonons and take into account only the @xmath7-polarized vibrations of ions , as charge carriers in the cuo@xmath1 plane of the cuprates strongly interact with @xmath14 polarized vibrations of apical ions @xcite .",

    "the latter effect is caused by the anisotropy of the structure rba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 of compounds . in this way we can model an interaction of the hole belonging to copper - oxygen plane with the apical oxygen ions at o(4 ) positions .",
