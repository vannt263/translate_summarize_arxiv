    "lattice simulations aiming to describe the features of quark gluon plasma and its transition to confined matter have become a field of high precision in the past years .",
    "an important goal of the efforts on the lattice is to provide theoretical background for collision experiments .",
    "the relevance of lattice results are most prominent for the heavy ion physics pursued at rhic and lhc , where matter with high energy density , but moderate or small chemical potentials are produced .",
    "lattice simulations solve quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in equilibrium .",
    "the solution emerges from a continuum limit , which is an extrapolation from a set of simulations on lattices with smaller and smaller lattice spacings ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "finite temperature ( @xmath1 ) is naturally implemented by a torus in euclidean time . in most thermodynamics studies the lattice spacing is expressed through the number of lattice points in the euclidean time direction : @xmath2 , which translates to @xmath3 . in most early papers @xmath2",
    "was set to @xmath4 or @xmath5 . by today",
    "@xmath6 data sets are not uncommon , and are believed to be necessary for a controlled continuum extrapolation even with improved actions .",
    "longer correlations ( inverse pion mass ) require larger computer resources to simulate the theory . in the past decade lattice field theory",
    "has seen a great development in gradually reducing the quark masses down to their physical values @xcite . simultaneously to this trend our increasing understanding of various discretization effects has lead to more efficient discretization schemes ( actions ) that allow a continuum extrapolation at an affordable cost @xcite . in view of these developments here",
    "we only discuss results with physical ( or nearly physical ) quark masses close to or in the continuum limit .",
    "evidence form lattice qcd shows that at zero chemical potential the transition from the chirally broken , confining phase of hadrons to the quark gluon plasma phase is a crossover @xcite .",
    "the transition temperature of a crossover transition depends on the observable one chooses . at vanishing light quark masses",
    "the chiral condensate is a genuine order parameter , which can be used to extract a chiral transition temperature . at sufficiently high quark masses",
    "the deconfinement transition is identified by a discontinuity in the polyakov loop as a function of temperature .",
    "varying the quark mass in the space of theories the relevance of chiral and deconfinement aspects can be tuned . with sufficiently light @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks an o(4 ) scaling of the chiral observables is conjectured @xcite .",
    "this universal mass dependence has been used to relate the transition temperature ( @xmath9 ) in qcd to @xmath9 for the actual simulation parameters @xcite .",
    "the wuppertal - budapest collaboration has simulated the qcd transition with physical quark masses in the stout staggered formulation @xcite .",
    "the lattice resolutions range from @xmath10 to @xmath6 . from the inflection point of the chiral condensate",
    "we find @xmath11  mev , where the first of the errors is statistical , the second is systematic , including the uncertainties of the scale setting @xcite .",
    "other @xmath9 definitions from chiral observables span a range of @xmath12 mev .",
    "recently the hotqcd collaboration has published a transition temperature , @xmath13  mev , based on the o(4 ) scaling @xcite , which is very well compatible with the range given by the wuppertal - budapest collaboration in 2006 .",
    "this is in contrast to the earlier continuum result ( 192(4)(7 ) mev ) by the rbc - bielefeld group . a key improvement",
    "since then was the adoption of the ` hisq ` action @xcite .",
    "the quoted values of @xmath9 are all based on lattice observables that are remnants of the chiral order parameter .",
    "one can also study other observables , such as the polyakov loop , which is the remnant order parameter of the deconfinement transition .",
    "the polyakov loop as well as the inflection point is renormalization scheme dependent .",
    "e.g. the scheme used in ref .",
    "@xcite was different than in our latest work @xcite .",
    "we made this change in our convention to be compatible with ref .",
    "@xcite in every detail .",
    "while the comparison of our result to the ` asqtad ` data has showed a disagreement , the new ` hisq ` data of the hotqcd collaboration was in agreement with ours @xcite .",
    "there are other observables that indicate deconfinement . the normalized energy density @xmath14 has an inflection point at @xmath15 mev , for the trace anomaly we have @xmath16 mev .",
    "the speed of sound has a minimum at around @xmath17 mev .",
    "these temperatures cover roughly the same range as we find from chiral observables . from the strange susceptibility , which characterizes the deconfinement of the strange degree of freedom we have a somewhat higher inflection point .",
    "of course , in a broad crossover the definition of the most singular point is also ambiguous .",
    "the concept of an identical chiral and deconfinement transition temperature was promoted by early lattice data @xcite , that positioned the peak of the chiral and the polyakov loop susceptibilities at the same temperature : @xmath9 . lacking resources , only theories with heavier quarks",
    "were simulated at the time .",
    "results with somewhat smaller quark masses on coarse lattices confirmed this picture @xcite .",
    "solutions to two - flavor qcd based on the functional renormalization group have shown the same conclusion @xcite . in full ( 2 + 1 flavor ) qcd",
    ", however , we see a very broad transition .",
    "thus the transition temperatures based on various observables generally do not coincide , they have their values in this broad transition region .",
    "the pressure and energy density of the quark gluon plasma is one of the key targets of lattice qcd simulations .",
    "these form the equation of state , which is required to close the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "early works on the qcd equation of state were dominated by quenched results @xcite .",
    "these were recently extended in range and precision , so that a connection to perturbation theory could be made @xcite .",
    "the calculations were also extended towards larger gauge groups @xcite . for several years",
    "we have seen various exploratory studies with non - physical or not renormalized quark masses . since ref .",
    "@xcite physical simulations have been feasible . in staggered simulations discretization effects",
    "raise the mass of the hadrons , and through this @xmath9 appears to be higher , and the energy and entropy density function is found steeper than physical , and the trace anomaly shows a higher peak .",
    "this is an artefact ( `` taste - breaking '' ) which is absent after continuum extrapolation , its impact on coarse lattices and older actions ( like ` asqtad ` ) was emphasized in refs .",
    "the wuppertal - budapest collaboration exploited the favourable taste - breaking features of the ` stout ` action and calculated a continuum estimate of the equation of state @xcite based on @xmath18 and @xmath19 runs .",
    "hotqcd used the ` asqtad ` and ` p4 ` actions at @xmath10 and @xmath20 @xcite , though these were later found to be incompatible with results with the better ` hisq ` action @xcite . for a comprehensive review",
