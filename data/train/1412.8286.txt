    "the discovery of graphene ten years ago@xcite triggered findings of a plethora of novel two - dimensional materials with unprecedented physical phenomena and potential technological applications@xcite .",
    "the wide variety of these novel 2d materials include insulators like hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn)@xcite and graphane@xcite , superconductors like niobium diselenide ( nbse@xmath0)@xcite , and semiconductors like molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) as well as other transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdc)@xcite .",
    "recently , the paradigm to obtain novel two - dimensional materials from the exfoliation of layered crystals gave rise to the single - layer black phosphorus , also known as phosphorene @xcite .",
    "phosphorene is a two - dimensional semiconductor formed exclusively by phosphorus atoms in a puckered anisotropic rectangular lattice due to the @xmath1 hybridization with lone pairs [ see fig . [",
    "fig : fig1](a ) ] .",
    "the single - layer and few - layer phosphorene can be obtained from mechanical exfoliation@xcite or plasma - assisted exfoliation of 3d layered crystal of black phosphorus ( bp)@xcite weakly bound by van der waals interaction .",
    "since phosphorene is a homopolar semiconductor , it shows some advantages when compared with tmdc , such as electronic inactivity of grain boundaries and native point defects@xcite .",
    "futhermore , the range of bandgaps from 0.3 ev ( bp ) to 1.6 ev ( single - layer)@xcite and high hole mobility allow the production of field - effect transistors with on / off ratio up to @xmath2 at room temperature@xcite .",
    "the puckered anisotropic geometry of phosphorene also allows bandgap engineering with in - plane@xcite and out - of - plane strain@xcite , resulting in direct - indirect bandgap and semiconductor - metal transitions@xcite .    .",
    "polynomial regression is shown with solid blue line , and dashed tangent line at @xmath3,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    one of the extraordinary phenomena observed in 2d semiconducting materials is the high stability of excitons , both due to the confinement of electron and hole and to the reduced screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "concordingly , excitons dominate the optical spectra of 2d semiconductors , and can even be detected at room temperature.@xcite measured exciton binding energies ( ebes ) on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides on sio@xmath4 are about 0.3 - 0.4 ev for sulfides and 0.6 ev for selenides,@xcite and in vacuum are expected to reach values as high as 0.7  ev in ws@xmath4@xcite and 1.1 ev in mos@xmath4.@xcite these values are much higher than in bulk ( @xmath5 0.1 ev for ws@xmath4@xcite ) and three dimensional semiconductors , where excitonic effects can be negleted from optical spectra to a good approximation . in suspendend ( freestanding ) phosphorene , the ebe has also been predicted to be 0.8 ev,@xcite even though phosphorene has a much smaller quasi - particle bandgap than ws@xmath4 or mos@xmath4.@xcite also recently , the phosphorene ebe was calculated with in - plane strain in elastic regime @xcite .    in this article , we consider the electronic and optical properties of phosphorene with uniaxial out - of - plane strain , and show that under such conditions the exciton binding energy can still be further increased .",
    "moreover , we show that in an extended range of applied stress ( both in the elastic and plastic regime ) , and specially near the point when the bandgap vanishes , the exciton binding energies are comparable to the quasi - particle bandgap .",
    "thus , it is necessary to take into account the strength of the exciton binding when interpreting the evolution of the luminescence under stress .",
    "the strain regime investigated here is comparable to what would be achieved in ideal conditions using a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) .",
    "the compressive force is applied perpendicular to the phosphorene plane , and uniformized by a pressure - transmitting medium .",
    "we adopt the assumption that for a 2d material , the strain imposed by such a device setup can be considered uniaxial .",
    "this approximation is based on the small lateral cross section of phosphorene , which is orders of magnitude smaller than the area of mechanically exfoliated flakes . due to phosphorene s high flexibility , strain as high as 22%",
    "can be reached in the dac , thus entering into the plastic regime of the material .",
    "the exciton binding energies for the 2d material with static dielectric constant @xmath6 were calculated with the dielectric screening induced by surrounding materials with dielectric constants @xmath7 ( above ) and @xmath8 ( below ) .",

    "[ fig : fig1](c ) . for strains of 34  % ( proportionality limit ) , the stress - strain curve is approximately linear . in this range",

    "the maximum stress , also called yield strength , is about 25 gpa .",
    "an alternative approach to the direct calculation of the stress can be conceived by spacial average of nielsen ",
    "however , instead of normalizing using the supercell volume ( with vacuum spacing ) , we normalized by the effective volume @xmath38 , where @xmath26 is the phosphorene height under pressure and @xmath27 is the phosphorene unit cell area .",
    "the young s modulus for the @xmath39-direction ( out - of - plane ) is slightly larger than the average of the young s moduli found in ref .",
    "for the _ zigzag _ and _ armchair _ directions ( in - plane strains ) . despite this hardening in the @xmath39-direction , the low young s modulus results in high flexibility and strongly tunable electronic properties with the uniaxial strain engineering",

    "futhermore , for strains greater than @xmath56  % the conduction band valley is located at @xmath55-point .",
    "this shift in the conduction band valley location is responsible for the change in the @xmath50 curve slope at 20  % in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) .",
    "we focus our attention on the @xmath52 excitons , that are expected to give rise to a luminescence peak throughout the whole range of strain , independently of the existence of a smaller indirect gap .",
    "the direct bandgap at @xmath52 takes lower values in two regions : ( i ) an approximately elastic region between 0 and 5  % , and ( ii ) plastic region from 20  % to 24  % .",
    "the exciton binding energies were determined in this region , using as input the 2d electric susceptibility and the effective masses obtained using density functional theory .",
    "the 2d electric susceptibility was calculated as described in ref . .",
    "the 2d screening is characterized by the @xmath57 and @xmath44 parameters given by the variation of the electric permittivities @xmath58 and @xmath59 as a function of spacing between phosphorene layers .",
    "these 2d electric susceptibility are obtained from the fitting @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the unit cell height , ranging from @xmath62    to @xmath63   , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "note that the 2d electric susceptibilities @xmath57 and @xmath44 are more anisotropic in plastic regime than elastic regime .",
    "however , the exciton binding energy calculation depends only on the geometrical mean @xmath64 .",
    "the phosphorene anisotropy can also be seen from the large variation of the electrons and holes effective masses as a function of strain .",
    "although the 2d electric susceptibility is averaged , the interaction between electrons and holes remains anisotropic through their effective masses in the _ zigzag _ and _ armchair _ directions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](a ) .",
    "while in the elastic regime the electrons effective masses are light in the _ armchair _ direction and heavy in the _ zigzag _ direction , in plastic regime this is reversed .",
    "this reversion is explained by the band crossing between two conduction bands ( @xmath65 and @xmath45 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4](b ) .",
    "this conduction band crossing occurs between @xmath46  % and @xmath47  % .    in the _ armchair _ direction , for low strains",
    ", the holes and electrons effective masses are roughly equal , resulting in reduced effective masses ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "however , for strains larger than 8  % , the electrons effective masses of @xmath45 state are so large that the reduced effective masses is approximately equal to holes effective masses ( @xmath67 ) . in the _",
    "zigzag _ direction , the holes effective masses are orders of magnitude greater than electrons effective masses , so that we have @xmath68 .",
    "based on the @xmath18 parameters and effective masses , we calculate the exciton binding energies ( ebe ) and luminescence energies ( @xmath69 ) as a function of the strain @xmath40 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "while the ebe increases 10  % for @xmath46  % ( from 0.79 ev to 0.87 ev ) , the luminescence increases almost 50  % for the same strain ( from 0.81 ev to 1.21 ev ) .",
    "this variation of luminescence energies is explained by the @xmath70 conduction band valley behavior with the strain , that increase of 30  % for @xmath46  % ( from 1.60 ev to 2.08 ev ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) .",
    "the ebe also depends strongly on the dielectric media into which phosphorene is immersed , parameterized by the mean permittivity @xmath9 .",
    "the ebe and luminescence energies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b ) in elastic regime and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](c ) in plastic regime .",
    "we have shown that the exciton binding energies are comparable in magnitude to the quasi - particle gaps and are sensitive to strain .",
    "thus , the variation of the position of the luminescence peaks under strain in the ideal dac experiment that inspired our work is affected by those two components .",
    "the resulting photon energy increases with strain in the elastic regime ( up to 5  % ) , in the plastic regime the trend is inverted and a redshift is observed .    in the elastic regime ,",
    "the photon energy blueshifts by up to 0.4 ev for only 5  % strain , and its variation is approximatelly linear , and nearly independent on the permittivity of the substrate .",
    "this suggests that the shift or broadening of the direct luminescence peak can be used as a direct way to probe the strain state of the material .",
    "this is an excellent alternative to raman measurements , since the phosphorene raman peaks are little changed by _",
    "strain,@xcite and is also affected by the number of layers and the proximity to the edge .    finally , we note that the exciton binding energy can be increased to 0.87 ev in vacuum for a modest strain of 5  % .",
