    "despite the lack of direct experimental evidence for supersymmetry , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) remains one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model .",
    "one of the nice features of the mssm with r - parity conservation is that it provides a natural cold dark matter candidate , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) .",
    "recently , the wmap satellite has measured precisely the relic density of cold dark matter , @xmath0 ( at 2@xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "this measurement severely constrains the parameter space of supersymmetric models .",
    "this is particularly true in msugra models where most of the scenarios compatible with wmap require a careful adjustment of parameters @xcite . indeed over most of the msugra parameter space ,",
    "the lsp is almost purely bino . as such",
    ", the lsp annihilates into fermions through the t - channel exchange of a right - handed sfermion .",
    "this process is not efficient enough to satisfy the tight wmap upper limit on the relic density of dark matter",
    ". then one must appeal to specific mechanisms such as rapid annihilation of neutralinos via s - channel higgs exchange or coannihilation of neutralinos with other sfermions @xcite to bring down the relic density in the desired range .",
    "another possibility is that the lsp has a significant higgsino component , then the couplings of neutralinos to the higgs or z is enhanced and annihilation into gauge bosons or fermion pairs becomes very efficient .",
    "one of these conditions is satisfied only for narrow strips in the parameter space of the msugra model @xcite .",
    "one basically finds three allowed region : the coannihilation region which occurs usually when @xmath2 ; the higgs funnel region where annihilation via a heavy pseudoscalar higgs into fermion pairs dominate at large @xmath3 ; the focus point region where at large values of @xmath4 one finds a neutralino with some higgsino component .",
    "note however that the location of both the focus point region and the higgs funnel depend strongly on the standard model input parameters , in particular the top quark mass @xcite .",
    "the careful tuning of parameters necessary to comply with the upper limit on the relic density from wmap within msugra is however not generic of all mssm models .",
    "models with either a higgsino or wino lsp generally satisfy easily the wmap upper limit because of the large cross section for the annihilation of neutralinos into gauge bosons or fermion pairs @xcite .",
    "such scenarios can be found for example in sugra models with non - universal gaugino masses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in non - universal models , the relation between the heavy higgs mass and the neutralino mass deviates from the msugra prediction and one finds that annihilation through a heavy higgs exchange can take place even at low @xmath3 .    in order to assess the potential of future colliders to discover supersymmetry it is therefore important to consider the different categories of models and examine the impact of the relic density constraint . here",
    "we review the constraints on msugra models showing also the impact of the top quark mass before discussing non - universal sugra models .",
    "other constraints including direct searches as well as @xmath5 are also briefly mentionned .",
    "the computation of the relic density of dark matter amounts to solving the evolution equation for the density of the lsp which depends on the effective annihilation cross section @xcite .",
    "coannihilation processes involving susy particles slightly heavier than the lsp can contribute significantly to the effective cross - section .",
    "however , these contributions are suppressed by a boltzmann factor @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass difference between the nlsp and the lsp and @xmath8 the decoupling temperature . here",
    "we will present results computed with the code @xcite .",
    "this code includes all annihilation and coannihilation channels and takes into account loop corrections in masses as well as in vertices .",
    "loop corrections for the higgs widths ( including the @xmath9 correction ) are also included .    within the context of a model defined at the gut scale such as msugra or non - universal sugra ,",
    "one crucial step is the evaluation of the physical spectrum corresponding to a given model .",
    "this is based on the renormalization group equations that specify the evolution of parameters from the high scale to the low scale as well as on the inclusion of radiative corrections to the physical masses of sparticles .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of the spectrum can seriously affect the prediction of observables at low energies and in particular of the relic density @xcite . here",
    "we will mainly present results obtained with the spectrum calculator 1.8.6 @xcite interfaced with  1.3 through the susy les houches accord @xcite .",
    "we first remark that within msugra the so - called bulk region ( at low @xmath10 and @xmath4 ) that used to be one of the favoured regions has considerably shrunk after the much tighter upper limit on the relic density from wmap .",
    "this is because in the bulk region the lsp is almost a pure bino .",
    "the annihilation of binos in fermion pairs is not efficient enough to satisfy the upper limit on the relic density of dark matter .",
    "one needs some additional contribution from the coannihilation or higgs exchange channels .",
    "the important contribution of the latter at large @xmath3 explains why the region allowed at low @xmath11 is more important , see fig .",
    "[ sugra_mt175 ] .",
    "note that the low @xmath11 region is also constrained from the higgs mass limit at least for intermediate @xmath3 and by the measurement of @xmath5 when @xmath12 .",
    "we are then left mainly with three regions : coannihilation , focus point and higgs funnel .",

    "in addition to neutralino annihilation into fermion pairs , the main coannihilation channels are @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the relic density is very sensitive to the nlsp - lsp mass difference .",
    "the proper mass degeneracy for a relic density consistent with wmap corresponds to a very narrow strip in the @xmath11 plane . in fig .",
    "[ sugra_mt175 ] , the allowed region correspond to the area between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 contours .",

    "the mass difference between the lsp and the sleptons of the first two generations can be larger .",
    "eventually , as the lsp mass increases the coannihilation cross sections also become too small and one obtains an upper limit on the lsp mass .",
    "we find for @xmath14 that @xmath32  gev,@xmath33  tev and @xmath34  tev .",
    "all this region should be within reach of the lhc @xcite .",

    "this occurs only for a large value of @xmath36 .",
    "although squarks are rather light , the main decay channel is into @xmath37 making it difficult for searches at lhc .",
    "the higgs annihilation region includes both a light higgs annihilation at low @xmath10 and a heavy higgs annihilation at large @xmath3 .",
    "the former occurs only for the lsp mass very close to @xmath38 since the light higgs has a very narrow width .",
    "the latter appears at moderate @xmath11 values and benefits from the enhanced couplings of the heavy pseudoscalar higgs to @xmath39-quarks .",
    "the main annihilation channels are @xmath40 corresponding to the preferred decay channels of the heavy higgs . due to the heavy higgs annihilation channel ,",
    "neutralinos as heavy as @xmath41  gev can give reasonable values for the relic density .",
    "the only condition is that @xmath42 .",
    "this type of model could be very difficult to hunt at the lhc as it features a rather heavy spectrum .",
    "indeed at the tip of the higgs funnel , one finds all squarks and the gluino in the @xmath43  tev range .",
    "note that the position of the higgs funnel is sensitive to the standard model input value used in the spectrum calculator codes , in particular @xmath44 @xcite as well as , to a lesser extent , the top quark mass @xcite . in evaluating the relic density in the higgs funnel ,",
    "the crucial parameters are @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "then the lhc can help constrain the relic density in this scenario with an accurate measurement of @xmath45 if the @xmath47 channel can be used @xcite .",
    "the last allowed region is the focus point region , this region is found at high values of @xmath4 where the value of @xmath48 drops rapidly .",
    "this occurs near the electroweak symmetry breaking border .",
    "when @xmath49 , the lsp has a significant higgsino fraction .",
    "the main annihilation channels are @xmath50 .",
    "coannihilation channels with heavier neutralinos and/or charginos are also important .",
    "the position of the focus point region is very sensitive to the value of the top quark mass that enters the rge and also differs for different rge codes , @xcite see fig .   [",
    "fig : mt]b . for the case of softsusy used here , rather low values of the top quark mass are necessary to reach the region where @xmath48 drops rapidly when @xmath14 . for @xmath51  gev ,",

    "_ , width=529 ]      the values of the standard model input parameters play an important role in determining the susy spectrum in msugra @xcite .",
    "therefore they have an impact on the relic density constraint .",
    "this is true especially in the focus point and the heavy higgs funnel regions . for one the heavy higgs masses , which often provide the only efficient annihilation mechanism",
    "also depend on the top yukawa as well as on @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "more importantly the solution of the renormalization group equation for the @xmath48 parameter , which drives the higgsino nature of the lsp , is extremely sensitive to the top yukawa @xcite .",
    "a heavier top quark , say @xmath61  gev , means a shift of the focus point region towards higher values of @xmath4 in fact beyond @xmath62  tev even for @xmath21 . for large values of @xmath4",
    ", it is difficult to obtain a converging solution , although the authors of ref .  @xcite find the focus point region all the way up to @xmath63  tev .",
    "the higgs funnel moves closer to the coannihilation region when @xmath20  gev .",
    "indeed the heavy higgs masses are shifted upwards with the increase of the top yukawa making it increasingly difficult to have @xmath64 .",
    "note that increasing the bottom quark mass has the opposite effect .",
    "finally the relaxed bound from the higgs mass means that one recovers part of the region where light neutralinos / charginos and sleptons can be found .",
    "the nature of the lsp strongly influences the value of the relic density of dark matter so constraints on susy models can differ markedly from the msugra case in models with a higgsino or wino lsp .",
    "this can be achieved by relaxing the gaugino universality condition .",
    "for one , the wino content of the lsp can be significantly increased in models where @xmath65 at the gut scale .",
    "second the value of @xmath48 can be much smaller than predicted in msugra thus increasing the higgsino fraction of the lsp .",
    "this occurs for example for models with @xmath66 at the gut scale .",
    "below we give explicit examples of these two types of models .",
    "basically one finds the same mechanisms as in msugra for getting sufficient annihilation / coannihilation of neutralinos but the allowed region in the parameter space of the mssm shifts significantly and no longer requires a fine tuning of parameters especially if one is willing to allow models which are below the wmap range .",
    "the direct constraints are of course also modified .      imposing @xmath68 at the gut scale lead to @xmath69 at the weak scale and a lsp with a higher wino content .",
    "then annihilation of neutralinos into w pairs becomes dominant .",
    "since this process is much more efficient than the annihilation into fermion pairs the relic density often falls below the wmap range @xcite .",
    "consider for example a model with @xmath70 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath71 at the electroweak scale .",
    "then the lsp is a mixed bino / wino state .",
    "the allowed region in the @xmath11 plane differs significantly from the msugra case @xcite .",
    "the annihilation into gauge bosons occurs and has a large enough rate even when the fermion annihilation channels is small because the sfermions are very heavy .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonuni]a , the whole region to the left of the @xmath27 contour has a relic density below the wmap range .",
    "agreement with wmap then implies a rather heavy lsp , for example @xmath72  gev for @xmath14 .",
    "the tail in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonuni]a corresponds to a region where coannihilation with the chargino becomes significant , this coannihilation proceeds near the heavy higgs pole .",
    "the constraints on this type of models from the higgs mass as well as from precision measurements are not significantly different than in the universal model .",
    "as concerns collider searches , the spectrum of coloured sparticles is not dramatically different then in msugra .",
    "however since the wmap allowed regions are completely different and in particular include a higgs funnel at small @xmath3 , models with very heavy squarks are perfectly acceptable . for example , for @xmath73  tev and @xmath14 , all squarks are in the 3 - 4  tev range .",
    "these are beyond the reach of lhc .",
    "furthermore , the lsp tends to be much heavier than in msugra , more importantly , the small mass difference between the chargino and the neutralino can effect searches .",
    "had we increased further the ratio @xmath74 we would have found a lsp with an even larger wino component .",
    "this would increase the values for the lsp masses compatible with wmap .",
    "for example if @xmath75 the lsp as well as the whole supersymmetric spectrum lies above @xmath76  tev unless there is an additional dark matter component .",
    "= 1.1 in    ( 0.1,2.6 ) ( -.1,0 )    ( 4.2,2.6 ) ( 2.1,0 )    [ fig : nonuni ]      decreasing the value of @xmath79 while keeping @xmath80 at the gut scale also means that the relic density constraint can be satisfied more easily .",
    "first , one finds smaller values for @xmath48 which means a lsp with a significant higgsino component and more efficient annihilation channels without requiring high @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "second , one finds significant areas of parameter space where neutralino annihilation proceeds through s - channel higgs exchange even for moderate values of @xmath3 .",
    "for example in the region of a @xmath81 nlsp , both stau - coannihilation and annihilation into fermion pairs via higgs exchange contribute to the effective annihilation cross section .",
    "as a result , when the @xmath82 are nearly degenerate the relic density is already much below the wmap range unless the lsp is very heavy . in this model , we also find rapid annnihilation trough a higgs resonance but this time for the coannihilation processes @xmath83 or @xmath84 via charged higgs exchange .",
    "the onset of the charged higgs exchange contribution is easily visible as a kink in the contours of constant relic density in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonuni]b . for large @xmath3",
    "the relic density constraint is satisfied in an even larger portion of the parameter space because of the more efficient annihilation / coannihilation through heavy higgses as well as a large higgsino - lsp region .",
    "note that in these models both the higgs mass and the @xmath5 constraints become more severe as the squark mass are lower than in the universal case for a fixed value of @xmath85 .",
    "a significant fraction of the models with @xmath86 predict squarks within the range accessible by the lhc .",
    "however the region compatible with wmap is not completely accessible even for intermediate values of @xmath3 . because of the annihilation / coannihilation through the heavy higgses , one can find reasonable values for the relic density even for very heavy neutralinos , hence a very heavy supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "for example for @xmath87  tev , @xmath88  tev , the spectrum consists of heavy squarks , @xmath89  tev , neutralinos and charginos , @xmath90  gev and also heavy higgses @xmath91  tev , a difficult task for discovering supersymmetry at colliders .",
    "the only new particle that could be reached at a collider would be the light higgs .",
    "the latest measurements of wmap on the relic density of dark matter put strong constraints on supersymmetric models . in particular in msugra very specific relation among sparticle masses and parameters should be satisfied : neutralino nearly degenerate with a sfermion , neutralino mass near half the mass of a higgs or neutralino with a significant higgsino component . in msugra",
    "most of the parameter space would be covered at lhc except for the tip of the higgs funnel region and part of the higgsino lsp region . in non - universal sugra models ,",
    "compatibility with the wmap measurements imposes similar conditions on the susy spectrum than in msugra .",
    "the main new possibility is for a wino lsp .",
    "however the relaxed constraints mean that a significant part of the allowed parameter space is beyond the reach of the lhc .",
