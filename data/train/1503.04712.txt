    ", it is usually argued that the amplitude of impurity - induced scattering from @xmath51 to @xmath355 at energy @xmath61 can only be significant if there is a high density of quasiparticle states at both @xmath51 _ and _ @xmath355 ( i.e. they have a large jdos ) .",
    "the qpi at scattering vector @xmath194 is the sum of all scattering processes where @xmath357 . by assuming that the qpi is large when the jdos is large , qpi patterns can be used to infer the jdos and hence electronic properties of the clean host material .",
    "experimental qpi data are typically interpreted in this way.@xcite    the usefulness and relative simplicity of the jdos picture has motivated efforts to connect rigorously the qpi and jdos .",
    "notably , the perturbative approach employed in ref .   makes the link by assuming a constant scattering amplitude and phase along the constant energy contour .",
    "but a faithful description of interfering scattering processes typically requires relative phase information ; and the jdos simply lacks information about overlap matrix elements between states in the impurity - coupled system . in consequence , the qpi may be small even when the jdos is large ( as may be verified explicitly ) .",
    "the jdos picture then fails to capture the basic physics of the scattering  as is known e.g.  in graphene.@xcite we emphasize that @xmath351 can not be derived from @xmath217 at a given @xmath194 and @xmath61 , in any controlled limit .",
    "however for a simple scalar impurity on a centrosymmetric lattice , the qpi and jdos are in fact related by hilbert transformation . from eqs .",
    "[ eq : qpi_1imp_cs_ps ] and [ eq : lambda_1imp_2d ] ( or e.g. eq .",
    "[ eq : lambda_1imp_3d ] ) , the qpi in this case can be written as @xmath358\\rho^0(\\bold k - \\bold q,\\omega ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have exploited periodicity across the 1sbz .",
    "we introduce the complex quantity @xmath359 , defined as    [ eq : qpi_jdos ] @xmath360    such that the qpi and jdos are hilbert conjugates , being respectively the real and imaginary parts of @xmath359",
    ".    the jdos interpretation of the qpi may thus be roughly correct for dilute scalar impurities on centrosymmetric lattices , because the underlying @xmath194-space topology of singular and nodal lines is the same for @xmath351 as it is for @xmath217 , both being related to a single complex analytic function @xmath359 .",
    "nevertheless , even in this case the qpi is _ not _ accessible directly from the jdos at a given @xmath194 and @xmath61 : the _ entire _ @xmath61-dependence of @xmath351 must be known to obtain @xmath217 by hilbert transformation . by way of illustration ,",
    "[ fig : qpivjdos ] compares the jdos to the qpi for the 2d square and ( 100 ) surface of the 3d cubic lattice ; in the former case the two quantities are roughly similar , while in the latter the jdos has significantly different @xmath308-space structure and intensity .",

    "[ eq : qpi_jdos ] ) ; for the 2d square lattice ( upper row ) and ( 100 ) surface of 3d cubic lattice ( lower row ) , for scanning energy @xmath61 and born impurity scattering potential @xmath148 as in fig .",

    "[ eq : qpi_regrho ] is inapplicable .",
    "the qpi , @xmath217 , then depends on both real and imaginary parts of @xmath359 due to additional @xmath194-dependent phase factors .",
    "this explains the failure of the jdos interpretation in the case of impurities in graphene@xcite ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : qpi_1imp_hc ] ) .    finally , we emphasize that the jdos and qpi are never related simply by hilbert transformation when magnetic impurities are present .",
    "this is because the t - matrix is a complex dynamical object : the real and imaginary parts of @xmath359 are again mixed . indeed",
    "the hilbert transform , involving integration over all energy scales , necessitates a full knowledge of the impurity dynamics  information simply not contained in the jdos .",
    "we have studied theoretically the use of quasiparticle interference ( qpi )  measured in ft - sts experiments  as a probe of magnetic adatoms on surfaces . following a general formulation of the qpi due to an arbitrary distribution of impurities , we turned explicitly to single - impurities adsorbed on a range of host surfaces : the ( 100 ) surface of a 3d simple cubic lattice , and the 2d honeycomb and square lattices , in which the fermi - level densities of states respectively embody standard metallic behavior , pseudogap behavior , and a divergence due to a van hove singularity . in all cases",
    ", the single - impurity qpi factorizes into a local scattering t - matrix , and a host response function @xmath307 at scanning energy @xmath362 .",
    "the scattering t - matrix for a magnetic impurity is simply related to the impurity green function  itself dependent on the host lattice  and thus the rich dynamics due to electronic correlations is manifest in the qpi . despite the local , momentum - independent nature of these correlations , the @xmath308-space structure of the qpi",
    "is found to be qualitatively different from that of a simple scalar impurity due to non - trivial phase shifts associated with scattering from magnetic impurities , which reflect e.g.  the kondo effect .",
    "the response function @xmath307 is also non - trivial , despite being a property of the free , non - interacting host .",
    "it displays significant structure in @xmath308-space , symptomatic of the symmetry and dimensionality of the host , but its energy - dependence becomes featureless for @xmath222 ( with @xmath8 the intersite lattice hopping ) .",
    "by contrast , the kondo physics due to a magnetic impurity is controlled by an emergent scale @xmath363 , and so scattering becomes strongly energy - dependent at low energies .",
    "indeed , the qpi exhibits _ universal _ scaling in terms of @xmath310 and @xmath339  a characteristic hallmark for systems containing magnetic impurities .",
    "conversely , the qpi for systems containing scalar impurities has no energy or temperature dependence on scales @xmath364 .",
    "the more complex case of qpi for multiple , mutually - interacting magnetic impurities , remains to be investigated .",
    "such systems will display an even wider array of impurity physics , due to the competition of local and non - local ( rkky - type ) interactions between impurities .",
