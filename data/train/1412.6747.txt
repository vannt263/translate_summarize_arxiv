    "the exponential increase in demand for high data rates in cellular networks requires new technologies to boost spectral efficiency .",
    "recently a heightened attention has been focused on the paradigm of massive multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) systems , which are envisioned as a promising key enabler for the next generation cellular network @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is well understood that channel state information ( csi ) plays a key role in multiuser mimo systems .",
    "a standard approach for acquiring csi is through pilot - aided channel estimation . for massive mimo systems , at prescribed positions of each coherence interval , all the active user equipments ( ues ) in the system",
    "send pilot sequences , which are pairwise orthogonal for ues within each cell and reused among the cells in a certain pattern ; each base station ( bs ) correlates its received pilot signals with the known transmitted pilot sequences to obtain the estimated csi .",
    "due to pilot reusing , interference is inevitable among the ues that share the same pilot sequence , and this is usually called _ pilot contamination _ in the literature . in the asymptotic regime where the number of bs antennas grows without bound",
    ", pilot contamination remains the only source of interference @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interference power grows in proportion to the desired signal power , implying that the achieved spectral efficiency saturates in the asymptotic regime since the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) is ultimately bounded .",
    "a number of solutions have been studied aiming at breaking the aforementioned bottleneck due to pilot contamination , and they can be largely classified into two categories : subspace techniques and coordinated design .",
    "subspace - based solutions exploit the extra degrees of freedom ( dof ) provided by the large number of bs antennas to enhance estimation performance beyond linear channel estimation @xcite @xcite . on the other hand , by coordinating the use of pilots or adaptively allocating and configuring pilot sequences among different ues , solutions based on coordinated design may effectively eliminate pilot contamination under appropriate system conditions @xcite @xcite @xcite .    in this work , rather than solely focusing on pilot contamination in the ultimate limit of infinite bs antennas ,",
    "our goal is to establish a comprehensive understanding of the various sources of interference in uplink transmission when the number of bs antennas is large but still finite .",
    "we consider a typical uplink channel in a multi - cell environment , in which the bs adopts minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimation for csi and performs maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) or zero forcing ( zf ) reception for each ue . leveraging stochastic geometry to model the spatial distribution of ues , we analyze the statistical characteristics of the interferences experienced in a typical uplink , including : intra - cell interference , inter - cell interference , and interference due to pilot contamination .",
    "the analytical results are applicable for any finite number of bs antennas , and converge to known asymptotic results as the number of bs antennas grows without bound .",
    "we have the following analytical results :    * for mrc reception with a practical but still large number of bs antennas , it is the intra - cell interference that accounts for the dominant portion of the total interference , and the impact of pilot contamination becomes dominant only when the ratio between the number of bs antennas @xmath0 and the number of available orthogonal pilot sequences @xmath1 is exceedingly large . * for zf reception with a practical but still large number of bs antennas ,",
    "on the other hand , we observe a significant reduction of the intra - cell interference compared to mrc reception , while the inter - cell interference and the interference due to pilot contamination remains almost the same . * in addition , for mrc reception with a practical but still large number of bs antennas in strong shadowing regime , the interference due to pilot contamination tends to have a much wider distribution range than the inter - cell interference .",
    "a similar phenomenon is also observed for zf reception .",
    "* letting @xmath0 and @xmath1 tend to infinity but maintain a fixed load factor @xmath2 , the mean intra - cell and inter - cell interference powers of mrc reception remain bounded away from zero , and grow in proportion with @xmath3 , and those of zf reception grow in proportion with @xmath4 .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect : system model ] outlines the system model .",
    "section [ sect : training and data transmission ] describes the pilot - aided uplink training scheme and derives the sinr expressions of a typical uplink for mrc and zf receivers respectively",
    ". then section [ sect : statistic analysis ] accomplishes a statistical analysis of the various interferences for the typical uplink , with the ue spatial distribution following a stochastic geometry model .",
    "section [ sect : simulation result ] presents numerical results to corroborate the analysis . finally section [ sect : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "we consider a cellular system in which the considered typical bs is located at the origin with its coverage area being a disk of radius @xmath5 .",
    "the typical bs has @xmath0 antennas and serves @xmath1 uniformly distributed single - antenna ues in its cell simultaneously .",
    "the @xmath1 mutually orthogonal pilots are uniquely assigned to each of the intra - cell ues , and the ues that reuse the @xmath6-th pilot outside the typical cell form a point set @xmath7.figure [ fig : system model ] illustrates the system configuration.to simplify notation , we let @xmath8 denote all the ues outside the typical cell , and @xmath9 denote the set of ues inside the typical cell .",
    "we denote the channel vector between the considered bs and a ue located at @xmath10 by @xmath11 and the channel matrix from the ues in @xmath12 to their corresponding bs by @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we take into account geometric path losses with both shadowing and small - scale fading , and the channel vector is thus @xmath14 where @xmath15 in which @xmath16 is the path loss coefficient and @xmath17 is the shadowing coefficient , and @xmath18 is the small - scale fading vector .",
    "we consider a block fading channel , i.e. , the fading vector remains constant in each coherence interval , and changes to an independent realization in the next coherence interval .",
    "we also consider a relatively stationary scenario where @xmath19 remains unchanged throughout the transmission .",
    "at the beginning of each coherence interval , all the ues in the system transmit their respective pilot sequences simultaneously .",
    "then , a typical bs correlates its received pilot signal with the known pilots , and performs a linear mmse estimation ; that is ,    _",
    "y_k = c_y_k , [ equ : equ_2 ]    where @xmath20 denotes the location of a ue that reuses the @xmath6-th pilot , @xmath21 is the uplink transmit power during the training phase , @xmath22 represents the normalized additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) , and @xmath23 is a normalization factor taking the following form :    c_y_k= ,  y_k\\{x_k}_k . [ equ : equ_3 ]    for simplicity of notation , we further define a variable @xmath24 that will be frequently used throughout this paper , i.e. ,    _ k=_x_k+_x_k_x+ , [ equ : alpha_k ]    which summarizes the large - scale fading of ues that reuse the @xmath6-th pilot as well as the noise term @xmath25 .",

    ". moreover , we decompose @xmath31 into @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the estimation error vector and is independent of @xmath34 , and it holds that @xmath35      utilizing the estimated csi , a typical bs constructs some linear receiver @xmath36 to perform the multiuser reception ; that is ,    = ^_y_0_ys_y+ , [ equ : equ_7 ]    where @xmath37 denotes the data symbol transmitted by the ue located at @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the uplink transmit power , and @xmath40 is the normalized awgn vector .    in this paper , we consider two widely used linear receivers mrc and zf , i.e. ,    _ k=    & , +   + _",

    "in this section , we first characterize the individual interference components in a typical uplink by taking the expectation with respect to small - scale fading . after that",
    ", we specialize to a system in which the spatial distribution of ues is described by a stochastic geometry model , and conduct a statistical analysis of the interferences . for simplicity",
    ", hereafter we ignore the effect of noise and focus on the interference - limited regime .      in this subsection",
    ", we characterize the individual interference components by taking expectation with respect to small - scale fading .",
    "we note that this exercise is reasonable since the main focus of this paper is on the comparison of the mean interferences .",
    "moreover , averaging over fast fading provides considerable insight into the comparison between mrc and zf , as will be shown subsequently .",
    "the analysis for mrc reception is straightforward from and .",
    "therefore we only account for the interference introduced by pilot reusing ues as an example , given by    @xmath52    note that , the first term in is exactly the pilot contamination term that persists even when the number of bs antennas tends to infinity . as a result , we incorporate the second term in into the inter - cell interference , and similar modification is adopted in the analysis of zf .",
    "in addition , we isolate the intra - cell interference @xmath53 and the inter - cell interference @xmath54 as follows :    @xmath55    noting that in ( 17 ) we incorporate the second term of .    for zf reception",
    ", we introduce a change of variable @xmath56 according to , where @xmath57 is a @xmath58 matrix whose elements are drawn independently from @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",

    "we summarize the results of mrc and zf in table [ tab : tab_1 ] .",
    "it is clear that the interferences due to pilot contamination @xmath65 and @xmath64 are almost the same except for a factor @xmath66 which is close to one .",
    "in addition , since @xmath67 is typically close to one for an intra - cell ue and close to zero for an outside ue , a significant reduction of the intra - cell interference and a slight attenuation of the inter - cell interference can be expected for zf , compared to mrc .",
    "the following proposition validates the substantial suppression of intra - cell interference for zf reception .",
    "[ prop : relation ] for the general system model we consider in section [ sect : system model ] , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath54 satisfy the following relationship : @xmath68    where @xmath69 denotes the upper bound of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    ". the remaining part of the proof is straightforward and hence omitted .    in other words",
    ", @xmath54 behaves approximately as an upper bound of @xmath62 and @xmath63 as long as @xmath74 is small .",
    "our simulation results in section [ sect : simulation result ] indicate that the approximation is good , especially when the effect of shadowing is not strong .",
    "furthermore , as will be seen shortly , it is the intra - cell interference that dominates the total interference of mrc , and therefore this intra - cell interference suppression achieved by zf is substantial . even for moderate @xmath0 , @xmath75 is nearly orthogonal with the intra - cell interfering channels , while @xmath76 is not .",
    "this explains why zf achieves much better intra - cell interference suppression than mrc .",

    ", we concluded that it is the intra - cell interference that accounts for the dominant portion of the total interference of mrc , and that a significant reduction of the intra - cell interference is achieved by zf .",
    "it is expected that the conclusion is fairly robust against propagation models and ue distributions .",
