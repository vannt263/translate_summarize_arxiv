    "benefiting from the idea of multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communication systems , mimo radar systems have received considerable attention in recent years . a mimo radar @xcite-@xcite although having some similarities with phased - array radar , is different in that it transmits multiple waveforms from its antennas , and in general offers a more flexible configuration .",
    "a mimo radar with widely separated antennas @xcite views a target from different decorrelated directions and thus enjoys spatial diversity . for",
    "mimo radar with colocated antennas @xcite@xcite , independent waveforms enable superior angular resolution as compared to phased - array radar .",
    "we focus on the colocated type of mimo radar throughout this paper .",
    "compressive sensing ( cs ) is a relatively recent development @xcite-@xcite and has already been applied successfully in diverse fields such as image processing and wireless communications .",
    "the theory of cs states that a @xmath1-sparse signal vector @xmath2 of length @xmath3 can be recovered exactly with high probability based on @xmath4 measurements via @xmath0-optimization .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the _ basis matrix _ that spans the space in which the signal is sparse , and @xmath6 be the _ measurement matrix _ that is used to linearly compress the signal .",
    "the @xmath0-optimization problem is formulated as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an @xmath9 sparse vector with @xmath1 principal elements while the remaining elements can be ignored ; @xmath10 is an @xmath11 matrix with @xmath12 .",
    "the product @xmath13 is referred to as the _ sensing matrix_. the uniform uncertainty principle ( uup ) @xcite@xcite indicates that if every set of sensing matrix columns with cardinality less than the sparsity of the signal of interest is approximately orthogonal , then the sparse signal can be exactly recovered with high probability .",
    "this implies that @xmath10 is incoherent with @xmath14 .",
    "throughput this paper , we will refer to the solution of a problem of the form ( [ cs ] ) as the _",
    "cs approach_.    by exploiting the sparsity of radar signals in various spaces , cs has been applied to radar systems @xcite-@xcite and to mimo radar @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a uniform linear array was considered as a transmit and receive antenna configuration and the cs approach was applied using a submatrix of the identity matrix as the measurement matrix .",
    "bounds on the achievable range and azimuth resolution and the number of recoverable targets were derived in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a cs - based mimo radar system implemented on a small scale network . according to @xcite , randomly located network nodes ,",
    "each equipped with a single antenna , serve as transmit and receive antenna elements .",
    "the transmit nodes transmit periodic pulses .",
    "the receive nodes forward their compressively obtained measurements to a fusion center . exploiting the sparsity of targets in the angle - doppler space ,",
    "an @xmath0-optimization problem is formulated and solved at the fusion center in order to extract target angle and doppler information .",
    "this approach achieves the superior resolution of mimo radar with far fewer samples than required by conventional approaches , which implies lower power consumption for the receive nodes .    the application of cs to step - frequency radar ( sfr ) @xcite was investigated in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "sfr transmits pulse trains of varying frequency .",
    "thus , although the individual pulses are relatively long in duration and are narrowband , the transmit signal is effectively wideband . since range resolution increases with the signal bandwidth , sfr achieves high range resolution . at the same time , sfr does not suffer from low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at the receiver typically associated with wideband systems that rely on short duration pulses . in @xcite , it was found that the cs approach can significantly reduce the number of pulses required by sfr to achieve a certain resolution . a cs - based data acquisition and imaging method",
    "was proposed in @xcite for stepped - frequency continuous - wave ground penetrating radars , and in @xcite cs was applied to stepped - frequency through - the - wall radar imaging . in both cases",
    "it was shown that the cs approach can provide a high - quality radar image using many fewer data samples than conventional methods .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a more general scenario than that of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the methods of @xcite and @xcite assume that the targets are located in a small range bin and the sampling is synchronized with the first target return .",
    "such assumptions do not allow for range estimation . in this paper ,",
    "the targets can be located across several range bins .",
    "we propose cssf mimo radar , an approach that applies step frequency to cs - based mimo radar .",
    "two types of cssf mimo radar systems are considered , i.e. , linear step - frequency radar ( lsfr ) , and random step - frequency radar ( rsfr ) , and their effects on the cs approach are studied .",
    "the proposed approach enables high resolution range as well as angle and doppler estimation .",
    "the problem of joint angle - doppler - range estimation is first formulated to fit the cs framework , i.e. , as an @xmath0 optimization problem . solving",
    "this problem entails high complexity as it employs a basis matrix whose construction requires discretization of the angle - doppler - range space",
    ". the complexity increases with the size of the basis matrix , or equivalently , as the discretization step decreases ; the latter step needs to be as small as possible as it sets the lower limit of resolution . for slowly moving targets",
    ", a technique is proposed that successively estimates angle - range and doppler in a decoupled fashion , and employs initial estimates obtained via a matched filter ( mf ) to further reduce the space that needs to be digitized . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "information on the support of a sparse signal was used in the minimization process resulting in complexity reduction . in our case",
    ", we do not explore the role of initial estimates on the minimization process , as they are not expected to be very reliable .",
    "instead , we use them only as a guide for the construction of the basis matrix .",

    "one can see that @xmath119 and @xmath120 are respectively the af of sf single - input single - output ( siso ) radar and mimo radar , both for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "it can seen from ( [ af_range ] ) that a colocated mimo radar has no gain on range resolution as compared to a siso radar , i.e. , the range resolution of mfsf mimo radar is at least equal to the best between the range resolution of sf siso radar and siso radar , where mfsf mimo radar refers to matched filter based mimo radar that uses the sf technique .    in @xcite , in a study of cs - based siso radar , it was observed that the maximum value of the correlation of two different columns of the basis matrix is equal to the second largest value of the discrete af surface . the recovery performance of cs approaches ,",
    "however , is directly related to the column correlation of the sensing matrix rather than the basis matrix .",
    "unlike @xcite , we next study the relation of the af and the column correlation of the sensing matrix for the proposed cssf mimo radar .",
    "this analysis will provide a clue for comparing the resolution of cs and matched filter in the context of sf mimo radar , i.e. , cssf mimo radar and mfsf mimo radar .    on letting @xmath121",

    "this type of sf radar can be efficiently implemented using the inverse discrete fourier transform ( idft ) @xcite ; however , it suffers from range ambiguity if the distance between a target and receive nodes exceeds the value @xmath134 .",
    "the range ambiguity can be removed by randomly choosing the step frequency within a fixed bandwidth at the expense of increased sidelobe as compared to the lsfr @xcite . in this section",

    "consistent with @xcite , which discussed convectional radar systems using the mfm , we find that the rsfr requires more pulses than lsfr to achieve the same range resolution for cs - based mimo radar .    since an increase in the number of receive nodes does not improve the range resolution , for simplicity we consider one receive node only .",

    "the minimum number of pulses required to achieve a certain resolution can be obtained by solving @xmath160 the above problem is easy to solve , for example by trying different values for @xmath81 ; however , it requires a value for @xmath159 . in @xcite ,",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath159 in the presence of mild interference was offered .",
    "in general , @xmath159 must be determined experimentally .",

    "given @xmath173 , an increase in @xmath147 would reduce the approximation error @xmath157 .",

    "<S> a new approach is proposed , namely cssf mimo radar , which applies the technique of step frequency ( sf ) to compressive sensing ( cs ) based multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) radar . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed approach enables high resolution range , angle and doppler estimation , while transmitting narrowband pulses . the problem of joint angle - doppler - range estimation is first formulated to fit the cs framework , i.e. , as an @xmath0 optimization problem </S>",
    "<S> . direct solution of this problem entails high complexity as it employs a basis matrix whose construction requires discretization of the angle - doppler - range space . since high resolution requires fine space discretization , the complexity of joint range , angle and doppler estimation can be prohibitively high . for the case of slowly moving targets , </S>",
    "<S> a technique is proposed that achieves significant complexity reduction by successively estimating angle - range and doppler in a decoupled fashion and by employing initial estimates obtained via matched filtering to further reduce the space that needs to be digitized . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results show that the combination of cs and sf results in a mimo radar system that has superior resolution and requires far less data as compared to a system that uses a matched filter with sf .    </S>",
