    "the presence of impurities usually deeply modify the nature of the spectrum of a quantum system , and thus its coherence and transport properties . in the absence of interactions , if the impurity distribution is completely random , all states of the spectrum are exponentially localized in dimensions one ( 1d ) and two ( 2d ) , while a mobility edge exists in dimensions three ( 3d)@xcite .",
    "if the impurity positions are correlated , as for instance if it exists a minimum distance between the impurities @xcite , some delocalized states can appear in the spectrum .",
    "this was demonstrated in 1d in the context of the random dimer model ( rdm ) and of the dual random dimer model ( drdm ) @xcite . in 1d",

    "the effect of correlations is almost unexplored , except for the case of a speckle potential @xcite , and for the case of pseudo-2d random dimer lattices with separable dimensions @xcite .",
    "correlations in speckle potentials may mimic the presence of a mobility edge @xcite , but in the thermodynamic limit all states are localized @xcite .",
    "random dimers introduce a set of delocalized states in pseudo-2d lattices @xcite as in 1d @xcite . from a statistical point of view",
    ", the main difference between these two models is the decay of the correlation function that is algebraic for the first and exponential for the second .",
    "this `` short - range '' feature of the random dimer model is at the basis of the delocalization mechanism .    in interacting systems ,",
    "the presence of disordered impurities gives rise to a remarkable richness of phenomena .",
    "for instance , the condensate and the superfluid fraction are modified by the presence of the disorder @xcite , and this can shift the onset of superfluidity @xcite , and , on lattice systems , can induce exotic phases such as the bose glass @xcite .    in this work we study the effect of a short - range correlated disorder on a bose gas confined on a 2d square lattice .",
    "first we introduce a 2d generalization of the drdm ( 2d - drdm ) . in such a model",
    ", impurities can not be first neighbours and each impurity also modifies the hopping with its nearest neighbor sites . using a decimation and renormalization procedure @xcite , we show that , in the non - interacting regime , it exists a resonance energy at which the structured impurity is transparent and the states around this energy are delocalized .",
    "it is remarkable that this resonance energy does not depend on the system dimensionality and it is the same as the drdm in 1d  @xcite .",
    "then , we consider the case of a weakly interacting bose gas confined on such a potential . within a gutzwiller approach ,",
    "we show that the effect of the 2d - drdm is to drive the homogeneity of the ground state .",
    "the disorder induces a non - monotonic behavior of the condensate spatial delocalization and of the condensate fraction as a function of the disorder strength , and enhances both in correspondence of the resonance energy of 2d - drdm single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "we show that the dependence of such quantities on the interaction strength can be explained by including the effect of the healing length in the resonance condition discussion .",
