    "softened or `` low momentum '' interactions are widely used in contemporary nuclear structure calculations because they exhibit faster convergence for methods using basis expansions ( this includes coupled cluster , configuration interaction , in - medium similarity renormalization group , and self - consistent green s function methods )  @xcite .",
    "such interactions are derived using unitary transformations starting from chiral effective field theory or phenomenological interactions that exhibit significant coupling of high- and low - momentum physics . when done in small steps ,",
    "these unitary transformations are a type of renormalization group ( rg ) transformation .",
    "the rg decoupling scale can be associated with the resolution of the interaction  @xcite .",
    "but how do we handle observables involving external probes when using such interactions ?",
    "nuclear structure has conventionally been treated as largely separate from nuclear reactions . however",
    ", this separation implies a unique factorization of experimental cross sections into the structure and reaction parts .",
    "the rg perspective informs us that such a division is itself inevitably resolution dependent  @xcite . in some circumstances the dependence is small and",
    "one can define the separation with negligible ambiguity .",
    "but the significant ( and beneficial ) changes to wave functions from evolving to lower resolution with rg methods imply significant changes to this separation .",
    "that is , what is structure at one resolution becomes part of the reaction mechanism at another resolution ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this separation is not only scale dependent , it is _ scheme _ dependent as well ; that is , it depends on _ how _ the separation is carried out and on the details of the original hamiltonian .",
    "this observation raises questions of consistency and uniqueness in analyzing and interpreting nuclear experimental data .",
    "for example , it is clear from previous calculations using the similarity rg ( or srg )  @xcite that the high - momentum tail of the momentum distribution in a nucleus is dramatically resolution dependent for the range of decoupling scales used in present - day nuclear structure calculations .",
    "how then can such a distribution be said to be extracted from experiment ? yet it is common in the literature that high - momentum components are treated as measurable , at least implicitly  @xcite .",
    "in fact , what can be extracted is the momentum distribution at some scale , and with the specification of a scheme .",
    "this makes momentum distributions model dependent  @xcite .",
    "this is relevant for recent work to extract a `` nuclear contact ''  @xcite .",
    "for some physical systems under certain conditions , such as the high - momentum @xmath0 tail in cold atoms at unitarity  @xcite , the scale and scheme dependence is negligible , so it _ can _ be determined essentially uniquely .",
    "but for nuclei this dependence may be substantial and one needs to carefully define the short - distance content of the nuclear contact .",
    "as illustrated in @xcite , details of the nuclear shell structure such as single - particle energies are not measurable .",
    "their extraction from experimental data involves fixing a scale and a scheme .    in general , to be consistent between structure and reactions",
    "one must calculate cross sections or decay rates within a single framework .",
    "that is , one must use the same hamiltonian and consistent operators throughout the calculation ( which means the same scale and scheme ) .",
    "such consistent calculations have existed for some time for few - body nuclei ( e.g. , see  @xcite ) and are becoming increasingly feasible for heavier nuclei because of advances in reaction technology , such as using complex basis states to handle continuum physics .",
    "recent examples in the literature include no core shell model resonating group method ( ncsm / rgm )  @xcite , coupled cluster  @xcite , and lattice eft calculations  @xcite .",
    "but there are many open questions about constructing consistent currents and how to compare results from two such calculations .",
    "some work along this direction was done in @xcite where the mean values for eigenstates of renormalized hamiltonians were calculated using evolved operators .",
    "we seek to extend this to transition matrix elements and explore the connection to high - momentum physics in a nucleus in a controlled manner .",
    "in particular , we will take the first steps in exploring the interplay of structure and reaction as a function of kinematic variables and srg decoupling scale @xmath1 in a controlled calculation of a knock - out process .",
    "there are various complications for such processes . with rg evolution",
    ", a hamiltonian  even with only a two - body potential initially  will develop many - body components as the decoupling scale decreases .",
    "similarly , a one - body current will develop two- and higher - body components .",
    "our strategy is to avoid dealing with all of these complications simultaneously by considering the cleanest knock - out process : deuteron electrodisintegration with only an initial one - body current . with a two - body system , there are no three - body forces or three - body currents to contend with . yet",
    "it still includes several key ingredients to investigate : i ) the wave function will evolve with changes in resolution ; ii ) at the same time , the one - body current develops two - body components , which are simply managed ; and iii ) there are final - state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "it is these ingredients that will mix under the rg evolution .",
    "we can focus on different effects or isolate parts of the wave function by choice of kinematics .",
    "for example , we can examine when the impulse approximation is best and to what extent that is a resolution - dependent assessment .",
    "we will vary the interaction resolution using srg transformations , which have proven to be technically feasible for evolving three - body forces  @xcite .",
    "the srg series of unitary transformations ensures that cross sections are invariant under changes in resolution .",
    "as the srg @xmath1 is varied , the hamiltonian @xmath2 and the nuclear wave function change , the current operator changes , and the fsi change as well .",
    "the question we address is : how do these combine to achieve the invariance of the observable cross section ?",
    "the electron scattering knock - out process is particularly interesting because of the connection to past , present , and planned experiments  @xcite .",
    "the conditions for clean factorization of structure and reactions in this context is closely related to the impact of 3n forces , two - body currents , and final - state interactions , which have not been cleanly understood as yet  @xcite .",
    "all of this becomes particularly relevant for high - momentum - transfer electron scattering .",
    "this physics is conventionally explained in terms of short - range correlation ( src ) phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "srcs are two- or higher - body components of the nuclear wave function with high relative momentum and low center - of - mass momentum .",
    "these explanations would seem to present a puzzle for descriptions of nuclei with low - momentum hamiltonians , for which srcs are essentially absent from the wave functions .",
    "this puzzle is resolved by the unitary transformations that mandate the invariance of cross section .",
    "the physics that was described by srcs in the wave functions must shift to a different component , such as a two - body contribution from the current .",
    "this may appear to complicate the reaction problem just as we have simplified the structure part , but past work and analogies to other processes suggests that factorization may in fact become cleaner  @xcite .",
    "one of our goals is to elucidate this issue , although we will only start to do so in the present work .",
    "the underlying picture is analogous to that used in deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite . in the analysis of dis ,",
    "one introduces both a renormalization and a factorization scale . in the usual dimensional regularization minimal subtraction scheme @xmath3 , the renormalization scale @xmath4 sets the division between long- and short - distance physics in the hamiltonian",
    "this is manifested in the running coupling @xmath5 where the choice of @xmath6 is to optimize the efficacy of the qcd perturbation expansion .",
    "the factorization scale @xmath7 dictates the division between what goes into the reaction part , namely the purely hard process described in pqcd , and the structure part , which is subsumed into the soft parton distribution functions . changing @xmath7 changes the balance . in many cases these two scales",
    "are chosen to be the same and equal to the magnitude of the four - momentum transfer @xmath8 , in order to minimize the contribution of logarithms that can disturb the perturbative expansion .",
    "the nuclear analogs to these two scales are tied together in the srg evolution . in particular , the decoupling scale , roughly given by the value of the srg flow parameter @xmath1 , sets both these scales . for the hamiltonian",
    ", this scale clearly sets the division between low and high momentum . for operators acting on wave functions ,",
    "the decoupling dictates the division between the two ; e.g. , the scale at which a one - body current is largely replaced by a two - body current . in the present paper",
    ", we will illustrate the combined interplay with quantitative calculations .",
    "we build upon previous work by anderson  _ et al._on srg operator evolution for the deuteron  @xcite , and the work by yang and phillips  @xcite in applying chiral eft to deuteron electrodisintegration .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "<S> renormalization group ( rg ) methods used to soften hamiltonians for nuclear many - body calculations change the effective resolution of the interaction . for nucleon knock - out processes , these rg transformations leave cross sections invariant , but initial - state wave functions , interaction currents , and final - state interactions are individually altered . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications for the factorization of nuclear structure and reactions . </S>",
    "<S> we use deuteron electrodisintegration as a controlled laboratory for studying how structure and reaction components are modified under rg evolution , without the complication of three - body forces or currents . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of these changes on kinematics is explored . </S>"
