    "in two previous papers ( levshakov & kegel 1997 , and levshakov , kegel & mazets 1997 , paper  i and ii hereinafter , respectively ) , we investigated the formation of absorption lines in chaotic media with finite correlation length of the velocity field ( _ mesoturbulence _ ) , when the observed absorption spectra correspond to only one line of sight .",
    "we have shown that accounting for a finite correlation length in the large scale stochastic velocity field changes the interpretation of absorption spectra considerably .",
    "the line profiles , as well as the equivalent widths , may be strongly affected by the correlations .",
    "therefore the standard analysis of absorption spectra based on the _ microturbulent _ approximation and the voigt profile fitting procedure may yield misleading results concerning the physical parameters of the absorbing gas ( for numerous examples , see levshakov & kegel 1994 , 1996 ; levshakov & takahara 1996a , b ; paper  i and paper  ii ) . at least one can say that the results obtained by the standard analysis are model dependent and , thus , are not unique .    in our cloud model",
    "we account for a stochastic velocity field with finite correlation length @xmath13 but assume the absorbing material to be homogeneous in density and temperature .",
    "the model is fully defined by specifying the column density @xmath14 , the kinetic temperature @xmath15 , the ratio of the r.m.s .",
    "turbulent velocity to the thermal velocity @xmath16 , the ratio of the cloud thickness to the correlation length @xmath17 , as well as one realization of the velocity field distribution along the line of sight . because of the very large time scale for changes in the hydrodynamic flows the random structure of the velocity field along a given line of sight has to be considered as ` frozen ' over the exposure time .",
    "it follows that the observed absorption spectrum in the light of a point - like source ( star , qso ) corresponds to only one realization of the velocity field .",
    "therefore , the intervening absorption spectrum can not be considered as a time or space average in the statistical sense .",
    "this means that the actual distribution of the hydrodynamic velocities at a given instant of time corresponds to an _ incomplete _ sample and , thus , may deviate from the average distribution function assumed to be gaussian .",
    "accordingly , significant deviations from the expected average intensity @xmath18 can occur .",
    " for this reason we used in paper  ii a monte carlo technique to calculate spectra corresponding to the absorption along individual lines of sight .    in paper",
    "ii we considered the direct problem , i.e. we specified the physical parameters and generated individual random realizations of the velocity distribution [ more exactly  the distribution of the velocity component parallel to the line of sight @xmath19 with which we then calculated individual spectra .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the inverse problem , i.e. the problem to deduce physical parameters from an observed spectrum . to reproduce a given ( observed ) spectrum within the framework of our model",
    ", one has to find the proper physical parameters _ and _ an appropriate realization of the velocity field . in general",
    ", @xmath20 is a continuous random function of the coordinate @xmath21 , but in the numerical procedure it is sampled at evenly spaced intervals @xmath22 .",
    "the necessary number of intervals depends on the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , being typically @xmath23 for hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "thus , to estimate model parameters from the observed spectrum one has to solve an optimization problem in a parameter space of very large and variable ( depending on @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) dimension .",
    "it is known that such kind of problems may be solved using stochastic optimization methods . the reverse monte carlo [ rmc ] technique based on the computational scheme invented by metropolis _",
    "et al . _ ( 1953 ) proved to be adequate in our case .",
    "the method is successfully used in many applications where the state space of a physical system is huge ( see e.g. press _",
    "_ 1992 , or hoffmann 1995 ) .",
    "we apply the rmc method to the problem of determining the primordial deuterium abundance at high redshift . in particular , the h+d ly@xmath0 profile observed by burles & tytler ( 1996 , b&t hereinafter ) in the spectrum of the quasar q 1009 + 2956 is considered .",
    "this spectrum was selected since ( @xmath24 ) it shows a pronounced di absorptions at the redshift @xmath1 , ( @xmath25 ) it was obtained with high signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution , and ( @xmath26 ) the total hydrogen column density estimated by b&t from the intensity level beyond the lyman limit in this system is consistent with the normalized intensities in the hi ly@xmath0 wings .    in the present paper",
    "we extend our study of the accuracy of the d / h ratio determinations from our galaxy ( paper  ii ) to the very distant ly@xmath0-systems ( putative intervening galaxies ) .",
    "the background source is supposed to be point - like and even in the case of distant qsos we consider absorption along one line of sight only .",
    "this means that any gravitational focusing which may , in principle , lead to an additional spatial averaging over different lines of sight ( an example may be found in frye _ et al . _ 1997 ) is not taken into account .",
    "( the average mesoturbulent h+d ly@xmath0 spectra have been considered by levshakov & takahara 1996a . )    in section 2 a description of the rmc method and the procedure to test its validity are given , while in section 3 the method is applied to analyze an observed h+d ly@xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the results obtained are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the rmc method belongs to the class of stochastic optimization algorithms developed to solve optimization problems with a very large number of free parameters .",
    "contrary to the standard monte - carlo procedure in which random configurations of a given physical system are generated to estimate its average characteristics , the rmc takes an experimentally determined set of data and searches for a parameter configuration which reproduces the observational data .",
    "the inverse problem is always an optimization problem in which an objective function is minimized .",
    "the objective function defined over a space of very large dimension is known to have many local minima .",
    "therefore optimization methods based on the choice of ` minimization direction ' ( so - called gradient methods ) may fail because of the possibility of being trapped in one of such minima .",
    "the rmc approach allows to overcome this problem .",
    "it can get over the local minima because it does not use any concept of ` direction ' .",
    "applied to the analysis of absorption spectra , the rmc method may be formulated as follows .",
    "the total parameter space consisting of the physical parameters ( like @xmath27 etc . ) and the velocity components @xmath28 parallel to the line of sight at the individual positions @xmath29 , is divided into two subspaces .",
    "let @xmath30 represent the subspace of physical parameters \\{@xmath31}. for the special case of h+d ly@xmath0 that we want to investigate , @xmath32 has to have one additional component d / h  the ratio of the di to hi column densities .",
    "let further @xmath33 be the vector of the velocity components parallel to the line of sight at the spatial points @xmath29 , determined by the recurrent sequence ( see paper ii ) @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the correlation function and @xmath36 is a random number picked from a normal distribution with @xmath37 and var(@xmath36 ) = 1 .    for a chosen @xmath32 and velocity field distribution the objective function @xmath38 is calculated according to @xmath39 ^ 2\\ , , \\label{eq : e3}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the simulated random intensity [ eq.(19 ) in paper ii ] , @xmath41 the observed normalized intensity within the @xmath42th pixel of the line profile , @xmath43 an estimate of the experimental error , and @xmath44 the degree of freedom ( @xmath45 is the number of data points and @xmath46 is the number of fitted physical parameters , @xmath47 in our case ) .",
    "the minimization of @xmath48 is the main goal of the procedure .",
    "any parameter configuration with @xmath49 has to be considered as a physically reasonable model for the interpretation of the observational data .",
    "the computational rmc procedure is split into two steps . at first",
    ", random values for the physical parameters are chosen , i.e. the vector @xmath32 .",
    "secondly , an optimal velocity field configuration is estimated for these parameters .",
    "the current @xmath48 value is computed and if it is larger than @xmath50 ( which is the value of @xmath51 for a given credible probability @xmath52 ) the whole procedure is repeated . in principle , to choose the vector @xmath32 in the physical parameter subspace we could use any of the common optimization methods ( like e.g. nonlinear simplex ) but we apply the same stochastic rmc procedure for both stages of the computational scheme . in detail it is described as follows .",

    "is chosen arbitrarily in the simulation box .",
    "next , the points * 3**5 * describe the evaluation of optimal velocity field configurations for a given set of physical parameters .    * 3 * ) a random realization of the velocity field is generated , and the corresponding value of @xmath48 is calculated .    * 4 * ) subsequently an element @xmath28 is chosen at random , and a random change is given to this element in accord with ( [ eq : e1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath53 happens to be equal to 1 , we put @xmath54 .    * 5 * ) the new value of @xmath38 is calculated . if @xmath55 , i.e. if @xmath56 , the new ` trial ' configuration of the velocity field is accepted .",
    "if @xmath57 , the trial configuration is accepted with a probability @xmath58 , i.e. we take a random number @xmath59 uniformly distributed in ( 0,1 ) , and if @xmath60 , the new configuration is accepted .",
    "if @xmath61 , the change is rejected and the configuration of the velocity field is returned back to its previous state .",
    "then we repeat the procedure from step ( * 4 * ) up to @xmath62 times to find the best solution ( i.e. the smallest @xmath48 value ) for the @xmath32 under consideration .",
    "@xmath62 is chosen such that each @xmath28 has been changed on average so often that var(@xmath63 . ",
    "the procedure is stopped when @xmath64 .",
    "* 6 * ) an element @xmath65 of @xmath32 is chosen at random , a random change @xmath66 is given to it , and the procedure starting from step ( * 3 * ) is repeated ( up to @xmath67 times ) until @xmath68 will be less than an expected value @xmath50 . if after @xmath67 repetitions the condition @xmath69 is not satisfied the procedure stops .",
    "@xmath67 is chosen such that each @xmath65 has been changed on average no less than 30 times to get a representative statistics .",
    "note that the convergence of the scheme depends on the size of the simulation box .",
    "the necessary size is unknown _",
    "a priori_. if it is too large , the computing time increases considerably , and if it is too small , the required @xmath48 value may not be reached at all .",
    "therefore the box size must be chosen with some care and should be adjusted to the experimental data .      in order to test the validity of our rmc - computer code",
    ", we performed several tests in which the ` observational ' h+d ly@xmath0 profile was generated for a given set of the parameters @xmath70 \\ {  @xmath71 , d / h = @xmath72 , @xmath73 k , @xmath74 , @xmath75  } , and for one random realization of the one - dimensional velocity distribution .",
    "the chosen parameters are typical for the warm diffuse interstellar gas ( cf .",
    "_ 1995 ) except for the d / h ratio which was taken approximately 10 times larger than the mean ism value in order to make the deuterium absorption being more pronounced in the simulated spectrum .",
    "the test was conducted with the aim of evaluating whether the code is capable of finding the correct @xmath32 and the correct structure of the stochastic velocity field . at",
    "first we considered a very soft constraint on the possible shape of the @xmath20 distribution .",
    "namely , only the blue wing of the h+d ly@xmath0 blend was used in the minimization procedure ( this may correspond to the case when the red wing of the hydrogen profile is distorted by the ly@xmath0 forest lines ) .",
    "we will see later ( section 3 ) that the uncertainty range of the d / h ratio determination found under this soft constraint may be considerably reduced by accounting for the shape of the whole h+d ly@xmath0 absorption .",
    "1a shows our simulated spectrum of h+d ly@xmath0 .",
    "the example exhibits a complex intensity structure in di .",
    "this complexity is caused by the finite correlation length effect only and , hence , it should not be interpreted as being caused by several ( at least three ) independent cloudlets with different radial velocities and different physical parameters . the velocity field distribution yielding this spectrum",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1c by the dotted curve .",
    "in order to illustrate the effects the correlated structure of the velocity field has on the line forming process , fig .  2 shows the local absorption coefficient @xmath76 for hi and di ly@xmath0 for three fixed wavelength @xmath77 and 1215.36    which correspond to the two minima and the maximum between them in the di profile shown in fig .",
    "the correlations have the effect that for a given value of @xmath78 the absorption coefficient may vary strongly along the line of sight . at the wavelengths chosen",
    "this effect is most pronounced for di .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the microturbulent model ( having the same @xmath79 and @xmath15 ) in which the whole region along the line of sight would evenly contribute to the absorption at a given @xmath78 .",
    "this is clearly seen from the hydrogen absorption coefficients which at the chosen wavelengths , lie in the range of the damping wing where both micro- and mesoturbulent models have the same solutions ( see paper ii ) .",
    "let us turn back to fig .  1 . the thicker solid curve in panel * a * marks the portion of the h+d ly@xmath0 profile used in the minimization procedure .",
    "to run the rmc - code we sampled the intensity at evenly spaced intervals @xmath80 and added to the @xmath41 the ` experimental ' errors which correspond to a signal - to - noise ratio s / n = 30 at the continuum level .",
    "the corresponding intensities and their uncertainties are shown in fig .",
    "1b by the open circles and error bars .",
    "we consider these data as being ` observational ' intensities and apply our rmc - code to estimate the set of @xmath47 parameters \\ { @xmath81 } and the corresponding velocity field configuration \\ { @xmath82 } .",
    "the estimated model parameters are accepted if @xmath68 is found to rank in the @xmath50 distribution , i.e. @xmath83 . the smooth curve in fig .",
    "1b shows one of the possible rmc solutions which gives an adequate fit with @xmath84 ( cf .",
    "@xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "it corresponds to the model parameters @xmath88 , ( d / h)@xmath89 , @xmath90 k , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and the @xmath93-configuration shown in fig .",
    "1c by the solid curve .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize once more that the derived @xmath93-configuration is not unique  : depending on the initial condition ( configuration of the velocity field ) we may obtain several patterns for the velocity field distribution that satisfy our acceptance condition ( each of them has its mirror counterpart which is also acceptable , of course ) .",
    "but the projected velocity distribution @xmath94 has approximately the same shape for all possible rmc solutions .",
    "an example of @xmath94 for the adopted and estimated velocity distributions is shown in fig .",
    "1d by the dotted and solid histograms , respectively [ here @xmath95 means the normalized velocity @xmath96 .",
    "the rmc procedure may result in the velocity field configuration becoming stuck in a local minimum of the @xmath38-function for a very long period ( ` meta - stable ' state ) .",
    "such a minimum may not solve the required problem at all .",
    "this difficulty may be circumvented by making a few starts from different random initial configurations .",
    "numerical experiments have shown that for a given point @xmath32 the @xmath68 values may scatter by about 30 per cent around the mean due to the probabilistic character of the solution for the velocity field .",
    "this fact should be taken into account when the error surface is calculated in order to determine the confidence regions for the estimated parameters \\ { @xmath97 } .",
    "to get meaningful confidence limits for fitted parameters the error surface must be calculated several times with different starting points .",
    "having calculated a set of error surfaces , the best one may be obtained by simply picking the smallest @xmath48 values for each point in the computational grid .",
    "two examples of the confidence regions for the ` log @xmath98  log d / h ' and ` log d / h  @xmath15 ' projections are presented in fig .  3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the results were obtained from a set of six computed error surfaces for each case . shown are two confidence ` ellipses '  the regions constrained by the @xmath48 values corresponding to 68.3  % and 95.4  % c.l .",
    "( 1@xmath99 and 2@xmath99 regions for a normal distribution of residues , respectively ) .",
    "the rmc solutions are labeled by the filled diamonds whereas the filled circles mark the adopted quantities used to produce the ` observed ' spectrum .",
    "a good agreement within statistical errors between these two points and between the two projected velocity field distributions can be considered as a justification of our computational procedure .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the elongated and declined shape of the confidence regions in fig .",
    "3 shows that the d / h value is strongly anti - correlated with @xmath98 .",
    "therefore the d / h estimates may be badly dependent on the assumed hydrogen column density .",
    "the correlation between @xmath15 and d / h is less pronounced",
    ". however , fig .",
    "4 shows that the kinetic temperature is not well determined in general .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the narrowest subcomponent of a complex absorption spectrum can show only an upper limit for @xmath15 since the correlated structure of the velocity field hampers the exact measurement of @xmath15 from the apparent @xmath25-values ( see paper  ii , for details ) .",
    "the example from subsection 2.2 demonstrates that complexity ( and/or asymmetry ) of an observed absorption spectrum is not necessary an indication of a clumpy structure of the absorbing material but may be solely caused by the correlations in the velocity field . therefore one may try to explain the observed spectra starting with a minimum number of _ ad hoc _ assumptions concerning the structure of the absorber .",
    "in particular , one may consider a cloud model with a homogeneous density and temperature , assuming that the observed h+d absorption from qso spectra arises in the outer regions ( halos ) of the putative intervening galaxies ( cf .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath98 ranges from @xmath100 to @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    "this in turn means that the geometrical size of the absorbing material ( parameter @xmath103 in our model ) may be very large , @xmath104 kpc .",
    "if there are many random velocity elements along the line of sight ( @xmath105 ) , the theoretical expectation value @xmath18 should be a good approximation to the observations ( paper i ) . if , however , the ratio @xmath17 is not too large , deviations of @xmath18 from the observed profile ( different kinds of asymmetry ) are to be expected .",
    "modern observations of the h+d absorption at high redshift revealed two limiting d / h ratios @xmath106 ( e.g. carswell _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , and @xmath107 ( e.g. tytler _ et al .",
    "the primordial d / h ratio is shown to be very sensitive to the physical conditions that existed at the time of the big bang ( e.g. walker _",
    "d / h is expected to decrease with cosmic time due to processing of gas by stars .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties in the calculations of the primordial hydrogen isotopic ratio are rather small , the d / h value being predicted for a given baryon - photon ratio , @xmath8 , with an accuracy of @xmath108 % ( see sarkar 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , accurate measurements of the primordial d / h ratio would provide important constraints on the cosmological theories .",
    "since these measurements are of fundamental importance to cosmology , the validity of the revealed two limiting d abundances and the reliability of the quoted errors should be thoroughly investigated .    in the following subsection",
    "we will show that accounting of the velocity field structure of the large scale gas flows may have a major impact to the d / h measurements .",
    "the rmc procedure was applied to the d absorption observed by b&t at @xmath1 in front of the quasar q 1009 + 2956 .",
    "two_-cloud microturbulent model and applying a voigt profile fitting procedure , b&t derived the following parameters for this system  : total hydrogen column density @xmath98 = @xmath109 @xmath102 and d / h = @xmath110 ; individual @xmath15 = @xmath111 k and @xmath112 k for the blue and red subcomponents , respectively , the corresponding turbulent velocities @xmath113 km s@xmath12 and @xmath114 km s@xmath12 , and a difference in the radial velocity ( derived from metal lines ) of 11 km s@xmath12 . including corrections for possible weak hi absorption at the position of d ( estimated as an expected value in monte carlo simulations ) , b&t reduced the measured d / h ratio to log ( d / h ) = @xmath3 ( i.e. d / h @xmath115 ) , where the @xmath116 random error followed by the systematic error from fitting the continuum level are given . however , for a given line of sight the proper correction is never known , and therefore we will not reduce d / h values in our analysis .",
    "this should be borne in mind when discussing the true d abundance .",
    "we start with the calculation of a template spectrum using the parameters of b&t listed in their table  1 . to simulate real data ,",
    "the experimental uncertainties are added to the computed intensities which were sampled in equidistant bins as shown in fig .",
    "5(*a1*,*b1*,*c1 * ) by dots and corresponding error bars .",
    "for the redshift the mean value of 2.504 was adopted and a _",
    "one_-component mesoturbulent model with a homogeneous density and temperature was used to construct the objective function .",
    "adequate profile fits ( @xmath68 per degree of freedom @xmath117 ) for three different sets of parameters are shown in panels ( * a1*,*b1*,*c1 * ) of fig .  5 by solid curves , whereas the individual hi and di ly@xmath0 profiles are shown by dashed and dotted curves , respectively .",
    "the estimated parameters and corresponding @xmath68 values are also listed in these panels for each solution .",
    "the adjusted @xmath118-configurations ( panels * a2*,*b2*,*c2 * ) and their projected distributions @xmath94 ( panels * a3*,*b3*,*c3 * ) show pronounced deviations from a single gaussian .",
    "such distributions may , in principle , have very long positive ` tails ' yielding unobservable d absorption which is hidden by the core of the hydrogen line .",
    "however , including in the objective function both the blue and the red wing of the hi line , allows to constrain significantly the set of the @xmath118-configurations . as a result the uncertainty for the d / h measurements is considerably reduced .    in accord with our calculations ,",
    "the restored profile of the di line in the @xmath1 system is almost symmetrical .",
    "a slight asymmetry of the red di ly@xmath0 wing is caused by the weak distortion of the @xmath94 distribution toward positive @xmath95-values . in this case",
    "the width of the di line may be formally characterized by the @xmath25-parameter  : @xmath119^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the inspection of fig .",
    "5 ( * a1*,*b1*,*c1 * ) reveals rather small @xmath120 value ( @xmath108 km s@xmath12 ) as compared with @xmath121 km s@xmath12 obtained by the rmc procedure .",
    "this is not a surprise , however , because random realization of the correlated velocity field may have @xmath94 which deviates substantially from the ensemble average distribution ( assumed to be gaussian in this case ) leading to a ` contraction ' of this distribution ( see paper ii ) .",
    "one may further be interested in the question whether such weak asymmetry of @xmath94 is essential for the analysis of the h+d ly@xmath0 profile , or whether a simpler one component microturbulent model could be used to study the @xmath1 absorber .",
    "the answer is that it is essential indeed , and that the simplified model fails to reproduce the profile in question .",
    "the smallest @xmath68 value obtained for this model is only 2.4 which rejects the one - component microturbulent solution .",
    "this example clearly demonstrates once more that the analysis of absorption spectra may be very sensitive to the model assumptions concerning the velocity field structure .",
    "the essential difference between the results of b&t and ours lies in the estimation of the hydrodynamical velocities in the @xmath1 absorbing region .",
    "the two - component microturbulent model yielded @xmath122 km s@xmath12 and @xmath123 km s@xmath12 which is about 10 times smaller than @xmath124 estimated by the rmc procedure .",
    "for the additional parameter @xmath17 of the mesoturbulent model , we found a value of @xmath125 , indicating that the space averaging along the line of sight corresponds to an incomplete statistical sample and , hence , significant deviations of the observed intensities from their expectation values may occur .",
    "as for the other parameters ( @xmath98 , d / h , and @xmath15 ) , the rmc method yields in this particular case values which are similar to those of b&t . the total hydrogen column densities and the d / h ratios obtained",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "6 by the filled diamond for the best rmc solution ( panel * b1 * in fig .  5 ) and by the filled circle for the b&t model ( the error bars shown correspond to @xmath116 in accord with the b&t data from table  1 ) .",
    "the filled triangle and square mark the ( @xmath98 , d / h ) pairs found separately for the blue and red components .",
    "the d abundance for the red component was assumed by b&t as ( d / h)@xmath126 = ( d / h)@xmath127 = ( d / h)@xmath128 and , thus , there was no real measurements of the d / h value for the red component in their model .",
    "this is marked by arrows instead of error bars at the filled square in fig .",
    "the projection of the 5-dimensional error surface onto the ` log @xmath98  log d / h ' plane was calculated by the rmc procedure using the @xmath129 method . drawn are 68 % and 95 % confidence regions computed under the condition that the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath130 , and @xmath17 are _ fixed _ , but the velocity field configuration is _ free_. as seen , the b&t value for the total @xmath98 is located closely to the rmc confidence regions , but the d / h ratio is systematically lower in the microturbulent model .",
    "7 shows 68  % and 95  % confidence regions for the two parameters @xmath15 and d / h computed under the assumption that @xmath98 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are fixed , but the @xmath118-configuration is free .",
    "the kinetic temperature is found in the range from @xmath131 k to @xmath132 k , whereas d / h lies between @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in this figure",
    ", the filled symbols label the rmc and b&t best fitting parameters in the same sense as in fig .",
    "note the marginal position of the rmc solution ( the filled diamond ) which shows that there are points in the ` d / h  @xmath15 ' plane with @xmath48 values less than @xmath135 adopted for the best rmc solution at the first stage of calculations .",
    "7 shows that also in the ` d / h  @xmath15 ' plane the d / h uncertainty region is shifted toward higher d / h values as compared with the b&t data .    above it was noted that the d / h ratio does sensitively depend on the @xmath98 value chosen . the measured d / h value and its confidence interval are both also affected by the choice of the velocity field configuration .",
    "the accuracy of the rmc solution may be increased if some additional information about the velocity field structure is available for the analysis .",
    "for instance , the profile shapes of higher order lyman lines may yield additional useful constraints to the allowable @xmath94 distribution . for this case",
    "the size of the d / h uncertainty interval may be narrowed down .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "8 where the results of two calculations ( formally called ` high ' and ` low ' d / h ) are shown .",
    "the 68  % and 95  % confidence regions were computed for the _ fixed _",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 listed in panels * c1 * and * a1 * ( fig .  5 ) , respectively , and for the _ fixed _ configurations of @xmath118 shown in panels c2 and a2 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "provided the constraints mentioned above are available and , thus a distinction between different @xmath94 distributions compatible with the measured h+d profile ( fig .",
    "5 ) is possible , the accuracy of the d / h measurements improves essentially becoming comparable with the accuracy of the sbbn calculations ( sarkar 1996 ) .",
    "we now discuss the observed d abundance and its inferred primordial value which can be compared with the sbbn model predictions . within the framework of the sbbn ,",
    "the primordial abundances of the light elements ( d , @xmath136he , @xmath5he , @xmath7li ) depend only on the baryon to photon ratio @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the current cosmological number density of baryons and @xmath139 is the number density of the cosmic background photons .",
    "the predicted relations between the abundances of d , @xmath5he , and @xmath7li and @xmath8 are illustrated in fig .",
    "the thick solid curves plotted in this figure are computed by using the analytical formulae from sarkar ( 1996 ) , while dashed curves depict their uncertainty intervals .",
    "the primordial mass fraction of @xmath5he , @xmath140 , was derived by izotov _",
    "( 1997 ) , and bonifacio & molaro ( 1997 ) give the following value for the lithium abundance in halo population ii stars  : log ( @xmath7li / h)@xmath141 = @xmath142 ( here the subscript p denotes primordial ) .",
    "the uncertainty regions for the measured values of y@xmath143he ) and ( @xmath7li / h)@xmath141 and the implied sbbn limits on @xmath8 are shown by the solid - line rectangles in fig .",
    "9(b , c ) .",
    "the upper panel * a * in this figure gives our results  : the solid - line rectangle is defined by the 95  % confidence region ( shown in fig .  6 ) for an arbitrary configuration of the velocity field , whereas two dotted - line rectangles correspond to 68  % confidence regions computed for the two fixed velocity fields leading to the ` high d / h ' and ` low d / h ' solutions shown in fig .  8 .",
    "the shaded region in fig .",
    "9 represents the range of @xmath8 compatible with the measured abundances of all three nuclei .",
    "shows that concordance of d / h with y@xmath143he ) and ( @xmath7li / h)@xmath141 measurements is achieved if @xmath9 .",
    "this constraint on @xmath8 is consistent with results of other groups ; for example , hata _ et al . _ ( 1995 ) quote @xmath144 @xmath145 [ see also sarkar ( 1996 ) for a discussion of the intercomparisons of the allowed @xmath8-intervals ] . the center of the shaded @xmath8-interval in fig .",
    "9 corresponds to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the fraction of the critical density contributed by baryons and @xmath11 the hubble constant in units 100 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "the uncertainties in this estimation can alter @xmath147 by up to @xmath148  % .",
    "the origin of qso absorption - line systems with hi column densities @xmath149 @xmath102 ( which are particularly useful for deuterium observations ) is usually associated with extended gas halos of foreground galaxies . according to recent high resolution observations ,",
    "the line profiles in these systems are often wider than expected from purely thermal broadening , and , therefore , their widths reflect both thermal and turbulent broadening caused by any kind of bulk motions in the halos . in turbulent media",
    "the determination of hi and di column densities depends on the model ( micro- or mesoturbulent ) is chosen for the profile analysis .",
    "the microturbulent model yields reasonable results if @xmath150 , or @xmath105 , otherwise the mesoturbulent one is more adequate .",
    "direct observations of the ly@xmath0 emission of distant galaxies ( @xmath151 ) show that their giant halos ( @xmath152 kpc ) have complex morphologies and kinematics ( rttgering _ et al .",
    "the observations reveal as well extended hi absorption systems ( with projected sizes up to @xmath153 kpc ) seen against the ly@xmath0 emission ( van ojik _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .    using the measured doppler parameters for the absorbing gas with @xmath154 @xmath102 ( see table  3 in van ojik _",
    "et al . _ ) and the kinetic temperature @xmath155 k adopted by van ojik _ et al .",
    "_ , we can estimate the range for the velocity dispersion of bulk motions  : 24 km s@xmath156 km s@xmath12 .",
    "it follows that @xmath157 within the hi absorption line gas embedded in the galactic halos .",
    "both findings  high absolute value of @xmath79 and high @xmath16 ratio ,  make the mesoturbulent approach to appear to be more realistic one . besides , our present rmc calculations yielded for the @xmath1 absorption system @xmath121 km s@xmath12 which lies just within the observed range , whereas @xmath158 km s@xmath12 found by b&t is evidently too low .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is that the mesoturbulent approach together with the rmc computational scheme allows to solve the inverse problem for the h+d ly@xmath0 absorption and to restore the physical parameters of the absorbing gas as well as the projection of the velocity field distribution .",
    "the proposed computational procedure enables us to draw confidence regions for different pairs of the adopted parameters . from the analysis of the synthetic h+d ly@xmath0 spectrum it was found",
    "that , in general , the measured d / h and @xmath98 values are anti - correlated .    the study of the template h+d ly@xmath0 profile ( which reproduces the original spectrum of b&t ) yields d / h = @xmath159 @xmath160 . we therefore adopt the value of @xmath2 as a conservative upper limit on the primordial abundance of d relative to hydrogen .",
    "we conclude that the discordance of d / h with the @xmath5he and @xmath7li primordial abundances noted by b&t is a consequence of the use of the microturbulent model . within the framework of the generalized model one finds good agreement between the measurements",
