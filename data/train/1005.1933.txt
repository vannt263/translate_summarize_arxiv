    "while nucleosynthesis is undoubtedly responsible for the production of the elements , there is less certainty regarding the stellar populations involved , as well as the time and location of elemental production .",
    "historically , these issues have been studied within individual galaxies , an ideal approach if they are nearly closed box systems .",
    "however , studies find that galaxies have lost the majority of their baryons @xcite and some undetermined amount of metals .",
    "for example , a galaxy like the milky way is missing 75% of its original baryon content while for m33 , the deficit is about 90% @xcite .",
    "galaxy clusters provide another useful system for studying metallicity evolution , as moderate and rich clusters retain most of their baryons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "baryons lost from galaxies are captured in the hot cluster medium , which is effectively studied in x - rays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the first order of business is to assess whether the stars in galaxies have produced the observed metallicity .",
    "simple estimates indicate a problem in that there are too few stars to account for the heavy element mass @xcite .",
    "we estimate that the metallicity of stars in galaxies , averaged over a standard luminosity function , is about 0.5 solar .",
    "galaxies comprise about 5 - 10% of the baryons in rich clusters , so if the metals in these stars were spread through the cluster , we expect the hot gas metallicity to be about 5% solar , but the typical metallicity is 40% solar ( e.g. , @xcite ) , about an order of magnitude higher .",
    "this issue was examined by several authors @xcite , who did careful calculations of metallicity production from the various types of supernovae , using a cosmic star formation history ( review of techniques by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite concludes that with any of the standard initial mass functions , the metals produced by the stars in galaxies can not produce the cluster metals .",
    "he posits the existence of a population of mainly high - mass stars to produce the cluster metallicity and he investigates the time evolution .",
    "@xcite reach a similar conclusion and adopt the imf proposed by @xcite , which is top - heavy ( @xcite use a top - heavy imf and a normal imf ) .",
    "a dissenting view is given by @xcite who find that for some clusters , the metals might have originated in galaxies .",
    "however , several of their adopted values are relatively extreme compared to the work of @xcite and @xcite .    in a related paper @xcite , we argued that field spirals are missing their baryons due to the presence of an early stellar population dominated by high - mass stars , which heats and enriches the gas before most of it collapsed into proto - galaxies . in this picture , which is driven by simple observational constraints ,",
    "galaxies are baryon - poor because the gas never fell into galactic dark matter potential wells . preheating ( and pre - enrichment ) by this early population",
    "would need to occur near the onset of galaxy formation , which occurs before cluster formation .",
    "therefore , this picture should apply to systems that eventually become galaxy clusters .",
    "it is natural to expect that the mass of the high - mass weighted early population of stars is proportional to the mass of a galaxy , so the collective mass of this population in a cluster should be proportional to the total stellar mass seen in galaxies today . translating this into a metallicity prediction , the metallicity of the cluster should be proportional to the ratio of the stellar mass to the total baryon mass , m@xmath0/m@xmath1 .",
    "this is the same expectation if the metals were produced and expelled from the cluster galaxies .",
    "we show that this basic expectation is excluded by the data , potentially leading to a profound change in our understanding of metallicity production in clusters and in the universe .",
    "for this study , we need to measure four parameters of galaxy clusters : the gaseous mass ; the stellar mass ; the total gravitating mass ; and the metallicity . from these quantities",
    ", we can assess the total baryon fraction of clusters , along with the ratio of the stellar mass to the total baryonic mass , and compare it to the metallicity .",
    "these quantities are most easily measured for low redshift clusters , which are the objects used .",
    "there are a variety of measurements of the properties of low - redshift clusters , but only a limited number measure the mass to large radii ( r@xmath2 ) and are close enough to measure the stellar mass content from sources such as the 2mass data set @xcite .",
    "we discussed many of these objects in a separate work @xcite , from which we select clusters that have retained most of their baryons , so have similar total baryon fractions ( table 1 ) ; these clusters appear to be relaxed .",
    "the gaseous masses are determined by fitting a functional form to the surface brightness distribution .",
    "the functional form begins with a @xmath3-model , which can be modified so that it steepens at large radii plus another component in the center @xcite .",
    "temperatures are determined from the data using spectral fits ( i.e. , apec models ) , and this temperature information is important in determining the total gravitating mass of the system .",
    "metallicities are normalized to @xcite where the relative abundances are held at these solar ratios . in determining a metallicity ,",
    "the most prominent lines are from fe , which is the most important element statistically .",
    "henceforth , we use [ fe / h ] as a proxy for metallicity , where the solar elemental ratios are assumed .",
    "a @xmath4cdm concordance cosmology is assumed with @xmath5 = 73 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7 = 0.26 , and @xmath8 = 0.74 .",
    "metallicity has been obtained as a function of radius for many of our systems by us and others , from which one can infer an emission - weighted metallicity or a mass - weighted metallicity ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the difference is generally not large , so we use the emission - weighted metallicity , as this is the only quantity available for clusters that are more gas - poor .",
    "the primary complication in making this measurement is accounting for the presence of cooling cores , which can bias the emission - weighted metallicity upwards by introducing additional flux from the enriched core , usually coincident with a central galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore present two metallicities for each cluster , one emission - weighted over all of the x - ray emission , and one that excludes emission from the core of the cluster , as described below .",
    "correctly accounting for a cool core requires careful deprojection of the emission , but we lack the data for such an analysis in all cases , and so perform a simpler correction .",
    "we examined the universal temperature and abundance profiles of @xcite for galaxy groups and @xcite for hot ( t @xmath9 kev ) galaxy clusters .",
    "both groups found temperature profiles that slowly rise towards the core , then decline more sharply starting at @xmath10 kpc , where t is the emission - weighted temperature of the icm in kev .",
    "most of the objects in our sample have temperatures within the range of values considered in these papers , so the same profiles should also apply .",
    "we therefore attempt to exclude emission from within a projected radius of @xmath11 kpc in each cluster to produce an emission - weighted iron abundance without the bias of a bright core ( t is in kev units ) .",
    "this is straightforward for the clusters with measurements from @xcite , since they provide measurements of the temperature , metallicity , and flux in a series of annuli for each cluster , which allows us to verify that a cooling core exists and then to remove the inner annuli and recompute the flux - weighted metallicity .",
    "we perform a similar analysis on 3c442a , for which we have measurements of temperature and metallicity as a function of radius ( sun 2009 , private communication ) , and for rgh80 , using the single - temperature fits of @xcite . for these two systems , we estimate the expected flux in each annulus by assuming the icm gas density follows a @xmath3-model with @xmath12 . in abell 1275",
    "the metallicities are from our analysis of the chandra data . for a160 , and a2462 @xcite , we have only global measurements of the metallicity , so we estimate the effect of a cooling core . based on the other clusters in our sample , the the exclusion of a bright core reduces the iron abundance by @xmath13 , so we use this correction .",
    "the final quantity is the stellar mass , which is obtained by identifying the galaxies and measuring their magnitudes to a radius of r@xmath14 , which includes nearly all of the stellar light .",
    "the data set for the galaxies used here is the 2mass data base , so there is a magnitude limit to galaxy identification .",
    "this leads to sampling only part of the galaxy luminosity function , so a correction is applied to account for galaxy incompleteness and poisson bias for a simple halo occupation model , as previously discussed @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties assigned are conservative in that they are larger than those given in @xcite .",
    "for some of the analysis , we include the metals in the stars , so we assumed a solar metallicity for that correction as applied to the total stellar mass .",
    "this procedure does not include a contribution from intracluster light ( icl ) .",
    "measures of the intracluster light were determined by @xcite for 10 galaxy clusters , where their fractional icl results are consistent with a single value of 11.1 @xmath15 1.3% ( @xmath16 minimization ) . for individual clusters ,",
    "the b and r weighted icl values range from 4.8 @xmath15 3.1% for abell 2556 to 21.3 @xmath15 6.6% for abell 4059 and there is no obvious correlation of the icl percentage with cluster properties .",
    "this measurement agrees with the value from theoretical modeling by @xcite and with the fraction of host - less supernovae in clusters , which is quoted as 20% ( + 20/-12 ) by @xcite and @xmath1720% by @xcite .",
    "another study that includes icl is that of @xcite , but they combine the icl and the light from the brightest central galaxy , so this does not provide an independent measure of the icl .",
    "they imply that the icl may increase toward poorer clusters . in the following analysis",
    ", we discuss the effects of icl that comprise 10 - 20% of the stars , as well as an increase of the icl toward poorer clusters .",
    "with the set of clusters for which we have good data , we examined the relationship between the metallicity of the gas and the fraction of the baryons in the form of stars ( fig 1 ) .",
    "a proportional relationship between these quantities is the nominal expectation , but the best fit , z = 2.44 m@xmath0/m@xmath1 , has a badly unacceptable @xmath16 = 729 for 10 dof , so it is ruled out . upon removing rgh 80 , the object with the highest value of m@xmath0/m@xmath1 ,",
    "the fit is still ruled out , as @xmath16 = 413 for 9 dof .",
    "the data are characterized by a metallicity that is slowly declining as a function of cluster mass , while the importance of the stellar mass increases toward lower cluster mass .",
    "we consider another model to explain the data , one where part of the metals are associated with stars b(m@xmath0/m@xmath1 ) , and the other where some fraction of the metals has an origin independent of the current visible stars , z@xmath18 .",
    "this second component can be understood as an early population component ( e.g. , dominated by high mass stars ) that is not proportional to the galaxy mass .",
    "this is expressed as a linear equation , z = z@xmath18 + b@xmath19(m@xmath0/m@xmath1 ) .",
    "we made fits to two sets of metallicities , a single emission - weighted metallicity for the cluster and a metallicity with the core excluded .",
    "the linear fits in the two cases are similar , but the fit is better for the metallicities without the core , so we concentrate on those results ( fig . 1b , 2 ) . for the case without the metal contribution from the stars , the best - fit is a negative slope , z = 0.37 - 0.70(m@xmath0/m@xmath1 ) , with errors on z@xmath18 and b of 0.02 and 0.23 ; @xmath16 = 18.5 for 10 dof , which is acceptable . for the case with",
    "the stellar metal contibution included , the best fit has a flat slope , z = 0.37 + 0.10(m@xmath0/m@xmath1 ) , with errors on z@xmath18 and b of 0.02 and 0.22 ; @xmath16 = 14.4 for 10 dof . the second fit is consistent with a constant metallicity , but the fit without the stellar metalliity is inconsistent with a constant metallicity solution .",
    "the inclusion of icl either does not change our result or make it more restrictive . when calculating the stellar component",
    ", we used a k band",
    "m / l of 0.95 . had we used the imf suggested by @xcite , the m / l would be about 0.72 , resulting in a stellar mass that is 24% lower . on the other hand , inclusion of icl would increase the stellar mass by 11% , using @xcite .",
    "either of these effect lead to minor scaling changes in m@xmath0/m@xmath1 , but do not change the results . if the icl increases significantly toward poorer clusters , which preferentially occur in the high m@xmath0/m@xmath1 part of the diagram , the maximum allowable slope for the gas metallicity is lowered as is the fraction of metals than can be associated with galaxies .",
    "this general result , that the metallicity is constant or decreases as the stellar fraction increases , has been known for over a decade .",
    "an increase in the ratio of the stellar mass to the gas mass with decreasing cluster temperature was first demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "a modest decrease of cluster metallicity with decreasing cluster temperature was discussed by @xcite .",
    "our work confirm these trends but uses more uniform stellar metallicities , gas masses , and total gravitating masses , all measured to large radii . for our conclusions to be invalid , a large body of work by others would need to be dramatically wrong .",
    "although we used systems in which the baryons are mostly retained by the clusters , the situation is not different if extended to galaxy groups in general . in their recent survey of 15 groups of galaxies , @xcite",
    "find that the metallicity of the gas beyond the central galaxy is lower than in clusters , a trend that is consistent with our result ( fig .",
    "the implications of this result are remarkable in that it suggests that not only are most of the metals in the richest clusters produced by the an imf dominated by high mass stars , but that the amount of mass in this component is not proportional to the stellar mass in galaxies . the need to produce most of the metals in an imf that is heavily weighted on the high - mass end",
    "was previously discussed @xcite .",
    "this inference is supported by the elemental ratios within rich clusters , which favor metal production by an ensemble of high - mass metal - poor progenitors @xcite .",
    "the mass of this stellar population would appear to be roughly proportional to the mass of gas in a cluster .",
    "this conclusion would explain the mean cluster metallicity , but not the metallicity gradient within a cluster . for that to be explained with this stellar component , the frequency of such sne would need to be biased toward higher density regions .",
    "this is similar to the arguments that were put forward for biased galaxy formation , so this might be considered biased star formation with a high - mass imf .",
    "clusters of galaxies were used in this study because they represent a `` closed box '' piece of the universe .",
    "the situation in clusters is likely to be representative of the universe as a whole , in which case , most of the heavy elements in the universe were produced outside of galaxies by an early population of supernovae .",
    "if correct , this represents a fundamental change in our understanding for the origin of the elements .",
    "this moderately enriched material ( 0.1 - 0.4 solar ) would fall into galaxies , producing a disk with few low - metallicity stars ( a previously proposed solution to the g - dwarf problem ) .",
    "the increase of the metallicity within galaxies is of course due to star formation , mass loss and supernovae within the galaxy .",
    "in addition to the above issues , some additional evidence supports our model . @xcite",
    "analyzed cluster metallicity profiles from z = 0.14 to z = 0.89 and from the lack of evolution , they conclude that the metallicity distribution was established at high redshift .",
    "@xcite note that fe is more extended than the light of stars , which could imply that the galaxies and the metals are not closely coupled ( they suggest an alternative model where agn heating is responsible ) .",
    "@xcite find that at z @xmath17 3 , less than 20 - 25% of the oxygen is associated with galaxies , which is also consistent with most of the metals being produced outside of galaxies .",
    "if there was a predominantly high - mass population of stars outside galaxies , the initial mass function of these stars could be constrained by the icl , provided one could separate the icl from galaxy - galaxy interactions with that from the high - mass stars .",
    "the present values of the icl must provide a limit to the slope of that imf , but future work may be able to constrain it more directly .",
    "another constraint on the nature of the metal production has been the variation of the elemental ratios with radius @xcite . in groups ,",
    "the si / fe ratio increases with distance away from the central galaxy , indicating that type ia are less important at larger radii @xcite .",
    "there is significant room for improvement in these types of studies , by using more elements , and especially for the hot clusters .    in obtaining this result ,",
    "only a dozen clusters were used , a shortcoming that can be rectified in future work .",
    "rich clusters are well - represented and the number of such objects can be increased with straightforward archival work of x - ray data ; these tend to have low values of m@xmath0/m@xmath1 .",
    "the greater weakness is the number of galaxy clusters with high values of m@xmath0/m@xmath1 .",
    "these tend to be of lower mass , relatively gas - poor and cooler systems , so the x - ray emission is weaker , making metallicity determinations from x - ray data more challenging .",
    "additional x - ray data will be needed to make progress here .",
    "finally , more accurate values of m@xmath0 can be determined with deep imaging , as typically only two dozen galaxies define l@xmath0 in a cluster . while these are the the brightest galaxies , the fainter end of the luminosity function should be determined in each case .",
    "we would like to thank ming sun for making his metallicity data for 3c442a available to us ahead of publication .",
    "also , we have benefitted from the comments and conversations with eric bell , jay lockman , mario mateo , doug richstone , jon miller , trevor ponman , jesper rasmussen , steve snowden , richard mushotzky , jimmy irwin , and renato dupke .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge financial support from nasa under grants from the chandra and xmm programs , and from the nsf , as mea is supported on a graduate fellowship .",
    "this work would not have been possible without the nasa data centers , most notably heasarc , isra , ned , along with the chandra and xmm archives .",
