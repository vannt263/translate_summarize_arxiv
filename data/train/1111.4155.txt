    "long - term stellar activity study is a challenging research area so far as it needs the longest available data sets , and appropriate statistical methods to treat the problematic in its complexity . @xcite",
    "first reported the long - term photometric variability of spotted binary stars , based on the archival photographic plate photometry combined with photoelectric photometric data .",
    "their work produced more than 50 years of activity history for by  dra and cc  eri .",
    "a similar result for v833  tau was published by @xcite , and is later confirmed by @xcite . star  spot activity is now known to occur on a range of solar  type and early k  giants stars .",
    "some relevant works in the field are those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the present analysis we used combined photographic , photoelectric photometry and ccd observations to study cyclic activity of the spotted subgiant star cf  oct . the collected data , presented on fig . 1 , are quasi  randomly distributed with data gaps over time interval of about 45 years .",
    "we applied the gregory - loredo bayesian method for time series with independent gaussian noise , @xcite , in order to obtain bayesian estimate for the known @xmath10  d rotational modulation and to search for long - term periodic variability in time - scales up to about 15 years .",
    "the method and the idl procedure , developed in the aiu jena , that we used have been previously tested on the synthetic data - sets , modeled with known period and amplitude , observational errors and simulated data gaps .",
    "they have shown reliable results and accurate period estimation .",
    "cf oct ( hd 196818 , hip 102803 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , j2000 , @xmath13 given by @xcite ) is a bright , southern active giant star .",
    "its variability was first detected by @xcite on the photographic plates from bamberg observatory southern sky survey ( bosss ) . in the gcvs @xcite",
    "the star is described as a rs  cvn type variable with maximal brightness @xmath14  mag and relatively large photometric variations @xmath15  mag .",
    "early archival observations from the bosss were recently digitized and analyzed by @xcite .",
    "photoelectric photometry for the star was performed and published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "rapid changes in the light curve in @xmath16 was announced by @xcite .",
    "the photometry studies reveal rotational modulation of @xmath17  d , due to spotted activity .",
    "spectroscopic studies by @xcite and @xcite of cf oct show strong caii emission and filled - in h@xmath18 line .",
    "@xcite reported for no significant radial velocity variations and hence concluded that the star is probably single .",
    "based on the radial velocity data and the period of the rotational cycle they consider it is a subgiant rather than a giant as per houk classification .",
    "cf  oct is also reported to be a strong , flaring , microwave radio source by @xcite , and appears at the rosat bright survey catalogue @xcite with 1.12 counts per second in the energy range of 0.12.4  kev .",
    "for the present study we have used data from : the bamberg observatory southern sky survey ( bosss ) , published photoelectric photometry observations , the hipparcos satellite time - series , and the all sky automated survey ( asas ) data archive .",
    "bosss @xcite was taken in the period 1963 to 1976 and contains more than 22 000 plates that cover the whole southern sky with limiting magnitude in range @xmath19 to @xmath20  mag .",
    "this survey is unique because of the fact that in this time interval the first palomar and harvard observatory southern sky surveys were completed , but other southern observatories were not actively surveying the sky .",
    "cf  oct was observed on 352 plates in the period 19641976 .",
    "@xcite performed aperture photometry and phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) light curve analysis .",
    "in @xcite we discussed the methods for photographic plate digitization , the plate photometry and the transformation from @xmath21 to @xmath22 magnitude of the star .",
    "plate data ( bam ) are collected in more then six seasons relatively well covered by observations , separated by significant intervals with a lack of observations .",
    "photoelectric photometry data ( phot ) came from following papers : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dataset consists of 137 data points , that might be separated in 5 seasons of intense observations . in this phot dataset the mean brightness of the star is at its historical minimum .",
    "it is not clear whether this is an observational selection effect .",
    "@xcite applied systematic magnitude corrections in order to have agreement for the photometry from different seasons , although they noted this was purely an ad hoc approach .",
    "changes of mean light level have been observed for other rs  cvn stars ( @xcite for hk  lac , @xcite for ay  cet ) .",
    "the hipparcos and tycho catalogues @xcite , available via the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( cds ) , provide high quality scientific data for the period november 1989march 1993 . for our research",
    "we have used the hipparcos time series data , as they have relatively smaller errors and are close to the photometry from tycho catalogues .",
    "the hipparcos magnitudes of cf oct were transformed to @xmath22 by the use of equations given by @xcite .",
    "the most recent photometry for our work is extracted from the asas , @xcite , archive at the web - page http://www.astrouw.edu.pl / asas/. the asas project aims at photometric monitoring of the whole available sky , from two observing stations ",
    "las campanas observatory , chile since 1997 and haleakala , maui since 2006 .",
    "both stations are equipped with two wide - field 200mm / f/2.8 instruments , observing simultaneously in @xmath22 and @xmath23 band .",
    "the project s ultimate goal is detection and investigation of any kind of photometric variability . as cf oct is a relatively bright star , so far the early asas photometry data are unusable due to saturated images .",
    "for this reason , after consulting with asas supporting team , for the analysis we included only the data free of saturation influence .",
    "the dataset we have collected contains data for hjd of the observation , @xmath22 mag of the star , and corresponding errors .",
    "as far as it consists of four datasets taken from different sources it suffers from significant intervals with lack of data , and also by non - uniform data distribution . the resulting @xmath22 magnitude light curve with overploted errors is presented on fig .  1 , where the crosses present bam data , asterisk - phot data , diamonds - hip data and triangles - asas data .",
    "the data - set statistically is presented in table  1 , with following information : dataset ; @xmath24 - the number of data points in the set ; @xmath25 - the time span of the set in days ; hjd is in the beginning of the set ; @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 - minimal , maximal and mean values of @xmath22 magnitudes respectively .",
    ".statistical description of the data [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,<,>,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to search for a long - term periodicity we have computed the bayesian pdf and estimated probabilities for period detection over the mean - subtracted magnitude ( @xmath29 , where @xmath28 is the mean value of @xmath22 for each data set , i.e. @xmath30=(@xmath31,@xmath32,@xmath33,@xmath34 ) data on long - term time scales with a prior period range from 600 to 6000  d. bayesian estimation of the probability for long - term periodic modulation over mean - subtracted magnitude data results in a marginal pdf ( fig .",
    "3 ) with three individual peaks with local maxima at @xmath35  d ( @xmath36  yr ) , @xmath37  d ( @xmath38  yr ) and @xmath39  d ( @xmath40  yr ) and @xmath5 of @xmath8  d , @xmath41  d and @xmath42  d respectively .    the phase shift of the minimal or maximal light suggested by @xcite and @xcite has led us to the idea to study time - residuals .",
    "the time - residuals represent the difference between the observed and model predicted times of signal minima ( or maxima ) and are an analog of the @xmath43 terms in light curves of the binary stars .",
    "they are representing the observed phase shift in the light curve of cf  oct and are probably connected with the spot migration over the stellar equator .",
    "we have computed the time - residuals by using stepwise ( with * @xmath44 * bins ) light curves of the phot dataset as a reference for expected times of minimal brightness of the star .",
    "the differences between the expected or predicted by the phot light curve and actually observed times of minimum brightness for all the observed data span were calculated .",
    "the marginalized ( over * @xmath45 * ) probabilities for detection of cyclic activity with period in the interval @xmath46 to @xmath47  d are presented on fig .  4 . the marginal total probability of 0.46 for cycle with a period of @xmath48  d ( @xmath49  yr ) with @xmath5 of @xmath6  d is estimated .",
    "this cycle length is in a good agreement with the suggestions of @xcite .",
    "a period of @xmath50  d was detected with the bretthorst generalization method and falls very close to the period determined by gl method . fitting the time - residual data with a stepwise curve with period of @xmath48  d is presented on fig .",
    "the other two peaks of the marginal pdf with periods near @xmath51 and @xmath52  d and @xmath5 of @xmath53 and @xmath54  d have relatively low probabilities both of @xmath55 and they give much more scatter of the stepwise fitting curve compared to the @xmath48  d period . we suppose that the minor peaks are probably due to the data gaps and the quasi - random data distribution .",
    "thus we consider that the period of @xmath48  d is the most probable for the time - residual data .",
    "the results from bayesian detection of the rotational modulation for cf  oct are in good agreement with previously published values . using the bayesian statistical method meant we were able to estimate the probabilities for rotational modulation over the priori selected range , based on the previous studies , and to determine the mode and mean periods derived from separate datasets as well as for all the observational data .",
    "the rather narrow credible intervals for period detection over the four separate datasets , state the range where the simple periodic model best describes the observations and thus we propose that the star probably exhibit variations in the rotational period . we have tested the hypotheses for constant , simple periodic and variable model for all the observed data and find out that the periodic model is still the most probable one . obviously this model does not explain the changes in the rotational period , so more complicated analysis with expanded hypotheses space to account for both rotational and long - term activity of cf  oct need to be performed .",
    "we were able also to estimate the mode period of @xmath1  d for all the collected data , but with relatively large credible interval .",
    "this is very close to the best period estimated over electrophotometric data by @xcite .",
    "the estimated rotational period varies from @xmath56  d for asas data to @xmath57  d for hip data .",
    "the most evident hypothesis for changes in the rotational period is differential rotation of the stellar surface , and latitude migration of surface spots .",
    "it is noteworthy to point out that rapid changes in the light curve of cf  oct were observed by @xcite in 2006 .",
    "asas data set does not have enough observations at the time of these changes that would give additional information .",
    "however for the asas observations after the reported changes near @xmath58 the amplitude of the variation is relatively small , about @xmath59  mag .",
    "@xcite suggested for activity cycle of @xmath9 years based on the changes of the amplitude of the spot - wave .",
    "the period for cyclic activity of @xmath60  d estimated with gl method by the time - residual data is in an agreement with this prediction .",
    "this new found cycle is another indication for changes in the rotational period of the star .",
    "inspection of the stepwise light curve with period @xmath60  d and ( fig .",
    "6 ) overploted on the time - residual data shows , that characteristic features - minima and maxima of the light curve are well supported by the observations .",
    "the derived period for cyclic activity of @xmath37  d over the mean - subtracted magnitude data is close to the period derived from time - residual data , but the @xmath61 of these cycles does not overlap .",
    "thus the hypothesis of the existence of the joint period for the magnitude and time - residual cycles in the presence of rotational modulation is very interesting and will be tested later by the use of the method used by @xcite .",
    "the estimated cycle of @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "5 ) by the use of magnitude data according the represented parameters is the most probable one , and also fits into the suggested cyclic activity by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath63 index for cf oct , for @xmath64  d , is in a good agreement with the values for active stars summarised by @xcite , nevertheless on fig .",
    "13 from the mentioned paper cf  oct would lie very close to the similar rs  cvn star hk  lac and would be also close to the line of the main sequence stars of @xcite . on the basis of other detections of long - term variations with two to three cycles for several stars reported by @xcite , and for the activity cycles analysis of @xcite for hk  lac , we also propose that the hypotheses for complex long - term variability with superposition of two or more cycles of cf  oct are relevant and needs future evaluating by the means of bayesian statistics .",
    "the main result of our work is that it clearly shows the evidence of a long - term activity cycle of the active giant star cf  oct .",
    "two cycles of @xmath60  d and @xmath35  d with @xmath61 of @xmath65 and @xmath8  d were detected by the use of two different statistical techniques .",
    "first one cycle of @xmath60  d represent the changes of stellar magnitude , while the second one is related to the changes of the phase of minimal brightness of the star , so it means that there is no superposition of the two cycles .",
    "we have given arguments that support previous suggestions for smooth period changes , due to differential rotation and possible spot migration , and derived the most probable periods for different intervals of the light history of cf  oct .",
    "the estimated rotational period are : @xmath66  d for the interval 196476 from bamberg observatory plate data , @xmath1  d for the interval 197988 from electrophotometry data , @xmath3  d for the interval 198993 from hipparcos data and @xmath56  d for the interval 200009 from asas archive .",
    "the bayesian analysis indicates that the hypotheses for presence complex cyclic activity of cf  oct is also relevant and it is a subject of future work to evaluate the proposition for observation of several long - period cycles over the joint analysis of magnitude and time - residual data .",
    "this work demonstrates the value of the astronomical data archives and draws attention to preserving archival observations for future exploitation . with the extension of the observational time series by the photographic plate data we are able to study decadal variations of bright active stars",
