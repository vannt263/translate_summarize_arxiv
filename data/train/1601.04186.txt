    "the calculation of the fractal dimension for the attractor of an iterated function system ( ifs - attractor , herein ) arises as an interesting question in fractal theory which could be dealt with from the point of view of fractal structures . in this way ,",
    "the classical result proved by moran in 1946 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem iii ) ) , allows to affirm that both the box - counting and the hausdorff dimensions for any strict self - similar set can be fully determined through a straightforward expression only involving the corresponding similarity factors . however , to achieve such a result , the osc is required to be satisfied by the similarities in that ifs .",
    "recall that the open set condition is a significant restriction for the pieces of an attractor to ensure that they do not overlap too much .    in this paper , some attempts to obtain a parallel result to moran s by means of fractal structures are contributed .",
    "in fact , both theorems [ teo:8 ] and [ teo : dim3 ] have been shown for fractal dimensions ii and iii , respectively .",
    "thus , while the former assumes that all the similarities must have a common similarity factor under the osc to reach the equality between the box dimension and the fractal dimension ii , the latter does not require to satisfy the osc by the similarities that define the corresponding ifs - attractor .",
    "moreover , it also allows different similarity factors in order to calculate its fractal dimension iii by means of an equation of the form @xmath0 . to end the paper ,",
    "an additional moran type result linking all the fractal dimension models for a fractal structure considered along this paper is contributed .",
    "the structure of this work remains as follows . in section [ sec : pre ] , all the necessary preliminaries , involving the basics on ifs - attractors , fractal structures ( and in particular , the natural fractal structure for an ifs - attractor ) , the classical models for fractal dimension ( namely , both the box and the hausdorff dimensions ) , the fractal dimension models for a fractal structure we explore in this paper for ifs - attractors , the osc , as well as the classical moran s theorem , are provided in order to make this paper self - contained .",

    "along this paper , let @xmath1 be a finite index set . in this section , we provide all the necessary concepts , definitions and theoretical results , in order to make the present work self - contained .",
    "accordingly , the structure of this preliminary section is as follows . in subsection [ sub : ifs ] , we recall the classical notion of an ifs , which becomes essential to show our main theorems in forthcoming section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "additionally , in subsection [ sub : fs ] , the concept of fractal structure is sketched from a topological point of view . it is worth mentioning that , also in such subsection , the notion of natural fractal structure which any ifs can be equipped with , is introduced .",
    "the next two subsections contains the basic definitions to calculate the fractal dimension for a given space .",
    "thus , while subsection [ sub : classics ] recalls the classical models for fractal dimension ( namely , both the box dimension and the hausdorff dimension ) , subsection [ sub : fdfs ] contains some models of fractal dimension for a fractal structure that have been developed following the spirit of classical fractal dimensions .",
    "finally , to end this section , we recall the definition of the osc as well as the 1946 moran s theorem in upcoming subsections [ sub : osc ] and [ sub : moran ] , respectively .",

    "in particular , if @xmath8 , then @xmath4 is said to be a contraction , and we will refer to @xmath9 as its contraction factor .",
    "further , if the equality in the previous expression is reached , namely , @xmath10 , for all @xmath6 , then @xmath4 is called a similarity , and its lipschitz constant is also called as its similarity factor .    for a metric space @xmath3 ,",
    "let us define an ifs as a finite family @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a similarity , for all @xmath13 .",

    "it is a standard fact from fractal theory that there exists an atractor for any ifs on a complete metric space @xmath17 .",

    "the concept of fractal structure , which naturally appears in several asymmetric topological topics @xcite , was first contributed in @xcite to characterize non - archimedeanly quasi - metrizable spaces . moreover , in @xcite , it was applied to deal with ifs - attractors . on the other hand ,",
    "fractal structures constitute a powerful tool to develop new fractal dimension models which allow to calculate the fractal dimension for a wide range of ( non - euclidean ) spaces and contexts ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "it is worth mentioning that covering @xmath38 is level @xmath39 of the fractal structure @xmath40 .",
    "to simplify the theory , the levels of any fractal structure @xmath40 will not be coverings in the usual sense . instead of this",
