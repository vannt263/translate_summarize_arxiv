    "this is an exciting time for tev - scale colliders , with experiments at the tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc ) collecting data at unprecedented luminosities and energies . in this study",
    ", we explore the prospects for discovering new physics through @xmath8 production , followed by the direct decays @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a new down - type quark ( with electric charge @xmath9 ) and @xmath3 is a long - lived neutral particle , leading to the signal @xmath10 .",
    "this study complements our previous study of @xmath11 production ( where @xmath12 is an up - type quark with @xmath13 ) , followed by the direct decay @xmath14 , leading to the signal @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of new physics leading to heavy flavor signals is , of course , well - appreciated , but such signals are usually accompanied by other visible particles from multi - step cascade decays .",
    "the direct decays considered here are much less studied , but are well - motivated from many perspectives .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem , for example , motivates top and bottom partners , new particles that cancel the radiative contributions from bottom and top quark loops to the higgs boson mass .",
    "the fine - tuning in such models is generally reduced when these partners are light , making it natural that such particles are among the lightest new particles and decay without cascades .",
    "the canonical example is supersymmetric models with top and bottom squarks that are lighter than the other squarks and decay directly through @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the lightest neutralino .",
    "dark matter provides another general motivation for the signals we consider . in many models of dark matter , the dark matter particle @xmath3 is the lightest particle charged under an exact symmetry , `` dark charge , '' and it may scatter off normal matter through processes @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is another new particle .",
    "this possibility is especially motivated at present by the possibility that such signals may in fact have been seen at dama  @xcite , cogent  @xcite , and cresst  @xcite . in such scenarios , the @xmath20 particles are necessarily colored and have dark charge ; they can be produced through @xmath21 and decay directly through @xmath22 .",
    "although these decays may be to any quark flavor , decays to @xmath23 and @xmath24 are realized in concrete scenarios with wimp dark matter , wimpless dark matter , and asymmetric dark matter , as we review in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] .",
    "such models are also , of course , much more amenable to study at hadron colliders than those in which the decays are solely to light quarks .    in a previous study  @xcite , we investigated the collider reach for up - type quark pair production @xmath25 , followed by @xmath14 . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the pair production of down - type quark @xmath8 with subsequent decay of @xmath1 at both the tevatron and 7 tev lhc using the madgraph / madevent / pythia / pgs4 packages .",
    "for relatively small values of @xmath26 , we will find that @xmath2 masses up to 440 , 460 and 480 gev may be excluded given integrated luminosities of 5 , 10 , and @xmath27 at the tevatron , respectively .",
    "this reach is greatly enhanced at the 7 tev lhc : with an integrated luminosity of only @xmath28 , the 7 tev lhc s 95% cl exclusion reach is comparable to that of the tevatron with @xmath27 .",
    "the whole region of @xmath29 allowed by yukawa coupling perturbativity can be explored with @xmath30 of data , and , with @xmath31 of data , @xmath2 masses up to 800 gev may be excluded .",
    "the 7 tev lhc also has great potential in terms of @xmath2 discovery : @xmath32 discovery contours reach @xmath2 masses of 540 and 700 gev for integrated luminosities of 1 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we also present model - independent results for collider reaches as a function of the @xmath33 production cross - section , with @xmath34 gev . from these ,",
    "for any theoretical prediction for @xmath35 as a function of @xmath29 , one can easily determine the expected exclusion and discovery reaches in @xmath29 .",
    "our results may therefore be applied to other models that give rise to the @xmath36 signal .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we discuss models that yield the @xmath7 signal and their implications for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses . in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] we discuss existing bounds on these scenarios .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] . in the appendix",
    ", we list cross sections at the tevatron and 7 tev lhc for standard model ( sm ) backgrounds and several benchmark points after various levels of cuts .",
    "we now discuss models that yield the @xmath7 signal and their implications for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 masses .",
    "we begin with the familiar examples of supersymmetry and universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , where the spins of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 particles are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "these are model frameworks in which existing searches have been carried out and the @xmath3 particle is wimp dark matter .",
    "we then discuss models with wimpless and asymmetric dark matter , where the spins are @xmath39 . in these models , @xmath3 is again dark matter , but the light mass range @xmath40 is particularly motivated by currently claimed signals . strictly speaking , our analysis is valid only for the spin assignment of the wimpless and asymmetric dark matter cases , but as described below , it is also applicable to the other scenarios with minor modifications .",
    "supersymmetric models yield the @xmath7 signal when bottom squark pair production is followed by direct decays @xmath41 , where @xmath18 is the lightest neutralino , an excellent dark matter candidate  @xcite .",
    "squarks are often assumed to decay through cascade decay chains .",
    "in contrast to other squarks , however , bottom ( and top ) squarks have their masses reduced by the impact of large yukawa couplings on renormalization group evolution , and their masses are also directly constrained by naturalness .",
    "there are therefore reasons to expect the bottom squarks to be relatively light and decay directly to the lightest supersymmetric particle , even if other squarks are heavy and decay through cascades .",
    "the salient features for this analysis are    * the signal arises from bottom squark pair production followed by @xmath16 .",
    "the decaying particle is a scalar , in contrast to all other examples discussed below . *",
    "the @xmath42 mass is only constrained by direct searches discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] , which require @xmath43 for small @xmath44 .",
    "the mass limit on @xmath45 becomes much weaker for small mass splitting @xmath46 .",
    "* the neutralino mass satisfies @xmath47 , assuming gaugino mass unification  @xcite .",
    "without gaugino mass unification , there is no lower bound on the neutralino mass , which in general may be anywhere in the range @xmath48 .",
    "ued models give the desired signature , where the new down - type quark @xmath2 is identified with the kaluza - klein bottom quark @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath49 can be pair - produced and then decay directly to kaluza - klein hypercharge gauge bosons @xmath50 , which may be wimp dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the salient features of this model are    * the signal arises from @xmath49 pair production followed by @xmath51 . *",
    "the @xmath49 mass is set by the size of the extra dimension .",
    "its mass is constrained only by the direct searches discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : limits ] , which require @xmath52 for small @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath54 , the mass limit is much weaker . * the size of the extra dimension typically sets the size of all the kaluza - klein particles , and so ued spectra are typically expected to be compressed relative to supersymmetry .",
    "one therefore expects @xmath55 , but @xmath50 masses anywhere in the range @xmath56 are experimentally viable .      in wimpless scenarios  @xcite ,",
    "dark matter is in a hidden sector .",
    "these scenarios have the notable feature that the dark matter candidate automatically has approximately the correct relic density , regardless of the candidate particle s mass .    the wimpless dark matter particle @xmath3 couples sm quarks to new quarks through yukawa interactions @xmath57 where @xmath3 is assumed here to be a complex scalar charged under a discrete symmetry , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are the sm quarks of generation @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are the new quarks , also charged under the same discrete symmetry as @xmath3 .    in general",
    ", the yukawa couplings can couple @xmath3 to any of the sm generations , subject to flavor constraints  @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to know what a `` natural '' flavor structure for new quark couplings should be , one reasonable possibility is that new quark couplings follow the observed yukawa hierarchy and couple new quarks dominantly to third generation quarks .",
    "in fact , for @xmath65 yukawa couplings , wimpless models with dark matter coupled to 3rd generation quarks may explain the reported dark matter signals from dama and cogent  @xcite .    for the purpose of the analysis presented here ,",
    "the salient features are    * the signal arises from @xmath2 pair production followed by the decay @xmath1 .",
    "dark charge conservation forbids the cascade decays @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and the possibilities @xmath68 are excluded by hand . *",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath2 are new quarks that get mass through electroweak symmetry breaking , with @xmath69 , where @xmath70 .",
    "yukawa coupling perturbativity requires @xmath71 , which implies the upper bound @xmath72 . for small @xmath26 , direct searches  @xcite place a lower bound , @xmath73 .",
    "this lower bound is weakened for larger dark matter mass . * for @xmath3 to freeze out with the correct relic density and preserve a key motivation for wimpless scenarios , it can not be extremely light , but the range @xmath74 is allowed",
    ". however , if one hopes to explain the dama  @xcite and cogent  @xcite anomalies and be marginally consistent with stringent exclusion bounds from cdms  @xcite and xenon10/100  @xcite , light masses with @xmath75 are preferred .",
    "there are several other models that share the basic features described above .",
    "one well - known example is little higgs models , where the new quarks are not 4th generation quarks , but instead arise from the extra degrees of freedom needed when the gauge symmetry @xmath76 is enlarged . unlike the wimpless case , the mass of the new quarks is not generated by yukawa couplings to the sm higgs , and thus is not bounded from above by perturbativity .",
    "these quarks may also be charged under @xmath77-parity , decaying to sm quarks plus dark matter ( the lightest particle charged under @xmath77-parity )  @xcite .",
    "another example is provided by a recent set of models in which @xmath78 is a gauge symmetry  @xcite . in this case , the new quarks are 4th generation ( possibly mirror ) quarks that are added to cancel the @xmath78 mixed anomaly .",
    "they are charged under a new @xmath79 global symmetry , and the dark matter is a scalar which is the lightest particle charged under this global @xmath80 .",
    "another class of models predicting the @xmath7 signature are models of asymmetric dark matter arising from hidden sector baryogenesis  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "sphalerons of a hidden sector gauge group generate a baryon asymmetry by producing exotic quarks  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 is the down - type exotic quark , which decays to dark matter and right - handed bottom quarks , @xmath81 .",
    "our analysis is directly applicable when the dark matter particle is a scalar . for this model . in this case , the relevant signal is pair production of the down - type exotic squark , @xmath82 , followed by the decay @xmath83 . ] in this model , the number density of the dark matter candidate is determined by the baryon number density .",
    "moreover , the dark matter multiplet and @xmath23-quark multiplet are both chiral under a @xmath84 gauge group ; both @xmath26 and @xmath85 are determined by the symmetry - breaking scale of @xmath84 , so one expects @xmath86 . as a result",
    ", this asymmetric dark matter candidate naturally has approximately the correct relic density .    for the purposes of this analysis , the salient features of the asymmetric dark matter model are    *",
    "the exotic down - type quark @xmath2 is not a 4th generation quark , and its mass is not generated by electroweak symmetry breaking . as a result",
    ", there is no upper bound on its mass , which is only constrained by direct searches to satisfy @xmath87 for small @xmath26 .",
    "* the asymmetric dark matter should have @xmath40 to correctly explain the relic density .",
    "but a dark matter mass @xmath88 is preferred to explain reported direct detection signals .",
    "* the exotic quark need not be down - type , but if it is , it necessarily decays through @xmath89 .",

    "the choice of cuts to distinguish signal from background is guided by a few key features .",
    "sm backgrounds exhibit @xmath126 either because of neutrino production or jet energy mismeasurement .",
    "the first source is suppressed by a lepton veto , which rejects processes involving @xmath172 . the second source can be effectively suppressed by a combination of minimum @xmath126 cuts ( which suppress multi - jet backgrounds ) and the requirement that @xmath126 not be aligned with any energetic jets .",
    "the alignment cut is imposed in terms of a minimum angle between the missing transverse energy and any of the selected jets , @xmath173 .",

    "<S> we explore the discovery prospects for @xmath0 pair production followed by direct decays @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a new quark and @xmath3 is a long - lived neutral particle . </S>",
    "<S> we develop optimized cuts in the @xmath4 plane and show that the 7 tev lhc with an integrated luminosity of @xmath5 may exclude masses up to @xmath6 , completely covering the mass range allowed for new quarks that get mass from electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is applicable to other models with @xmath7 signals , including supersymmetric models with bottom squarks decaying directly to neutralinos , and models with exotic quarks decaying directly to gev - scale dark matter . to accommodate these and other interpretations , we also present model - independent results for the @xmath7 cross section required for exclusion and discovery </S>"
