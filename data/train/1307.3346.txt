    "the constant @xmath269 is another feature of interest here .",
    "it too was introduced in , and its novelty lies in the fact that one usually estimates by an absolute constant which does not depend on @xmath77 .    in this article",
    "we propose estimates for @xmath269 which depend on @xmath77 and tends to zero for @xmath77 growing .",
    "this approach enables us to consider and to obtain approximation error estimates for wide functional classes without strong assumptions upon the decay rate of initial signals .",
    "it seems that proposed estimates are the first attempts in sampling theory to analyze the properties of the series @xmath320 for @xmath321 as functions of @xmath152 .",
    "the proposed procedure treats the truncation error @xmath322 in one and higher dimensions and it results in sharper estimates in comparison with known ones in the literature .",
    "very interesting relations have been found on the dependence between the extremums of @xmath78 , its various properties and the joint behaviour of @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "new related truncation error upper bounds are derived in @xmath323norm for the sampling restoration procedure .",
    "several numerical examples illustrates the matter in the multidimensional case too .      1 .   to investigate the case of @xmath85 in theorem  [ the2 ] .",
    "it seems that there are only two possible cases in the behaviour of @xmath324 $ ] .",
    "the first one concerns decreasing @xmath78 , its maximum is in @xmath79 ; the second one means increasing @xmath78 to certain local maximum , and then it decreases , see the plots of @xmath325 on figures  1,2 .",

    "4 .   to obtain sharp estimates in theorem  [ th4 ] . it has to be mentioned that for @xmath146 such sharp estimates were derived in @xcite .",
