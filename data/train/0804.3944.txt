    "recently , the interest in wormholes has increased because of the possibility of interstellar travel or future time travel to past world .",

    "wormholes are solutions to einstein s field equations which represent two connected universes or a connection between two distant regions of universe . for",
    "realistic models of traversable wormholes , one should address additional engineering issues such as tidal effects .",
    "people is skeptic about them because they contradict some commonly accepted reasonable energy conditions , for example , their structure requires matter with negative energy density as a source , i. e. exotic matter @xcite . a full revision on wormholes can be consulted in @xcite and @xcite .    among an enormous variety of wormhole solutions , there are some kind of spherically symmetric wormholes that evolve with time .",
    "this type of wormholes have been extensively analyzed .",
    "roman @xcite explored the possibility that inflation might provide a mechanism to enlarge tiny wormholes to macroscopic size and investigated the possibility of avoiding the violation of the energy conditions in the process . further evolving dynamic wormhole geometries",
    "were analyzed , considering specific cases @xcite- @xcite ; and also was considered the evolution of a wormhole model in an frw background @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , nonlinear electrodynamics has recently been applied in several branches in physics , namely , as effective theories at different levels of string / m - theory @xcite , cosmological models @xcite , black holes @xcite- @xcite and in wormhole physics @xcite , among others . in this context , in a recent paper it was shown that ( 2 + 1 ) and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional static spherically symmetric as well as stationary axisymmetric traversable wormholes can not be supported by nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "however , it was found an evolving wormhole solution within nonlinear electrodynamics @xcite , where the lagrangian depends in nonlinear way on one electromagnetic invariant .    in this paper",
    "we explore some properties of the evolving wormhole geometry in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics .",

    "leaving aside the study of the stability of the solution , we delve into the analysis of the tidal gravitational forces that an infalling radial observer must bear while traversing . we take as our traversability criteria the magnitude of the tidal forces that an observer can stand during the trip : it must not exceed the forces due to earth gravity , much on the spirit of @xcite . to simplify our calculations",
    "we shall work in a proper reference frame given by    @xmath92    where @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the velocity of the radial motion @xcite .",

    "we point out the fact that eq .",

    "the redshift has been set equal to zero , the radial tides are zero , then if some danger exists for the traveler it is in the nonzero accelerations while traversing the wormhole . in what follows we show that there is not tidally induced shear .    the @xmath103 matrix that describes tidal forces is defined by    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is an orthonormal triad orthogonal to the four - velocity @xmath106 .",

    "it is important that any nonlinear theory recovers the form and results of the corresponding linear theory , nonlinear electrodynamics is not an exception @xcite .",
    "however there are cases where the maxwellian limit is not recovered @xcite .",
