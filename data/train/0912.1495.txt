    "in @xcite , arnold has shown that a hyperbolic version of the concurrence altitudes theorem for triangles holds in the projective plane , to which the space of binary quadratic forms projects .",
    "in fact , this theorem is a direct consequence of the jacobi identity for the poisson brackets , in the poisson algebra of the binary quadratic forms @xmath2 on the symplectic plane @xmath3 .",
    "the space of the coefficients @xmath4 of the quadratic forms is also endowed in @xcite with a scalar product ( defining its metrics ) as well as with a vector product ( the poisson bracket ) , so that the orthogonality of two forms is defined as the vanishing of their scalar product , and the poisson bracket of two forms is a third form orthogonal to the two initial forms .    a geometrical notion of duality between points and lines in the projective plane is also introduced in @xcite , which allows to give a geometrical meaning to any expression involving poisson brackets .",
    "the starting point of the present work was the following consideration .",
    "the real vector space @xmath0 is a lie algebra if endowed with the vector product @xmath5 the vector product ( [ vectorp ] ) is @xmath6 invariant and has indeed a geometrical meaning in the oriented @xmath0 , provided with euclidean metric .",
    "however , the six vector products in @xmath0 , corresponding to choices of the signs @xmath7 for the components of ( [ vectorp ] ) such that not all signs are coinciding @xmath8 satisfy the jacobi identity and the corresponding lie algebras are all isomorphic to the algebra @xmath1 .",
    "each of these vector products has a geometrical meaning in @xmath0 , endowed with an orientation and with the ( pseudo)metric @xmath9 . the vector product of two vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 is orthogonal to both @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the orthogonality being the vanishing of the scalar product defined by the metric .",
    "now , the poisson algebra of quadratic forms , together with the scalar product introduced by arnold , is , up to a change of coordinates , the lie algebra of @xmath0 with vector product ( [ vps ] ) and pseudo euclidean metric given by @xmath12 .",
    "a natural question is : does it exist a poisson algebra on a symplectic manifold corresponding to the euclidean @xmath0 ?    in section 1 we show that such algebra is the 3-space of spherical harmonics of first degree , with @xmath13-metric .    projecting this space to the unit 2-sphere , we associate with each harmonic a pair of antipodal points and its _ dual _ object , the great circle equidistant from these points . like in @xcite ,",
    "the poisson bracket has a geometrical interpretation and the jacobi identity assumes the meaning of the altitudes concurrence theorem for spherical triangles .    in section 2",
    "we show that the pseudo euclidean geometry of the poisson algebra of quadratic forms can be obtained as well as the poisson algebras of the hyperbolic harmonics of first degree on the one sheet and on the two sheeted hyperboloids . in these cases the scalar product and the metrics are not defined intrinsically ( as in the spherical case , by the @xmath13 norm ) , but the vanishing of the scalar product of two harmonics has a geometrical meaning in terms of the metrics of the hyperboloids similar to the meaning of the vanishing of the scalar product of two spherical harmonics in terms of the metric of the sphere .    in section 3",
    "we see the relation between the projective geometries obtained projectivizing the pseudo - euclidean space ( as in @xcite ) and the euclidean one .",
    "moreover , we observe that in the case of pseudo - euclidean geometry , any non degenerate conic in the plane can play the role of the absolute of the lobachevsky disc for a suitable projection : the orthogonality and duality can be therefore defined using this conic , obtaining the concurrence theorem for the corresponding triangle ` altitudes ' , defined in this projection .    following the arnold suggestion : `` _ one might use the jacobi identity and other theorems of the quadratic forms symplectic algebra to obtain new results of projective geometry _ '' ,",

    "the map : @xmath280 , sending @xmath286 to @xmath283 is therefore bilinear and skew - symmetric .",
    "since the volume form is well - defined up to a constant factor , @xmath287 is also well - defined up to a constant factor .",
    "it is completely independent of any kind of additional structure , say , orthogonality , duality between points and lines in the same projective plane etc .",
    "similarly , if we take two vectors @xmath288 and @xmath289 in the dual space , then the linear functional @xmath290 on @xmath284 , which sends @xmath291 to @xmath292 , is a vector in @xmath279 ( since @xmath293 is canonically isomorphic to @xmath279 ) .",
