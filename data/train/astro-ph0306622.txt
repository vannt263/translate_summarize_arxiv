    "millisecond pulsar psr j0218@xmath04232  is remarkable in many respects .",
    "it has a very broad and complex radio pulse profile with 3 pulses ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and a @xmath6 radio dc contribution ( @xcite ) , suggesting that we continously look into the radio beam . at x - ray energies",
    "a double peaked profile has been observed ( rosat hri : @xcite ; bepposax mecs : @xcite ; chandra hrc - s : @xcite ) , and also in this regime a dc - component has been detected , significantly only at soft x - rays , and possibly originating from a spatially extended region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsed 0.1 - 10 kev x - ray spectrum turns out to be very hard with a photon index in the range 0.5  1.0 .",
    "surprisingly , marginally significant pulsations have also been reported at high - energy ( @xmath7 mev ) @xmath1-rays from a sky region containing an @xmath8 egret source , 3eg j0222 + 4253 , which is positionally consistent with psr j0218@xmath04232  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 100 - 1000 mev @xmath1-ray profile shows one prominent pulse and a weaker broader one , coincident with 2 of the 3 radio - pulses .",
    "the high - energy @xmath1-ray emission is consistent with being 100% pulsed and its spectrum can be described by a power - law with a photon index @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , inaccuracies in the absolute timing of the events during the rosat and bepposax observations made direct comparisons of the soft and medium energy x - ray profiles with the radio and high - energy @xmath1-ray profile impossible .",
    "the aim of the chandra and rxte observations was to shed light on the spatial extent of the x - ray counterpart of psr j0218@xmath04232  ( cxo ) , to obtain high - resolution x - ray pulse profiles which could be phase related to the radio and @xmath1-ray profiles ( cxo and rxte ) , and to extend the spectral coverage to energies beyond 10 kev ( rxte ) .",
    "chandra observed psr j0218@xmath04232  twice with the high resolution cameras hrc - i and hrc - s .",
    "these cameras are multichannel plate detectors sensitive to x - rays in the 0.08 - 10 kev range with no spectral resolution . the first observation on 22 - 12 - 1999 with the hrc - i in the focal plane of the telescope mirror and the second observation on 5 - 10 - 2000 with the hrc - s in the special imaging mode yielded effective exposures of 74.11 ks and 73.21 ks , respectively .",
    "psr j0218@xmath04232  was detected significantly ( @xmath10 ) in the first observation .",
    "its spatial extent is consistent with that of a point - source .",
    "thus we have no evidence of extended x - ray emission from psr j0218@xmath04232  at scales larger than @xmath11 .",
    "the second hrc - s observation was devoted to the timing analysis of psr j0218@xmath04232 .",
    "phase folding the barycentered times of the x - ray events falling within @xmath12 from the centroid of the x - ray counterpart of psr j0218@xmath04232   yielded the well - known double peaked profile with high statistics ( see figure [ hrcs_profile ] ) .",
    "the deviation from being flat applying a @xmath13-test is @xmath14 .",
    "indicated in figure [ hrcs_profile ] as a hatched area is the dc or unpulsed level ( @xmath15 ) determined using a bootstrap method ( @xcite )",
    ". also indicated as a dashed line is the background level derived from an imaging study .",
    "the pointlike dc component can clearly be discerned in figure [ hrcs_profile ] .",
    "the fraction of source counts over the entire 0.08 - 10 kev energy range from this dc - component is @xmath16 . combining the chandra hrc - s dc count rate with those observed by the rosat hri and bepposax mecs and assuming a spectral model for the dc emission we can put constraints on the spectral parameters . for a power - law model the @xmath17-range for the photon index is 1.31.85 , much softer than the pulsed emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "chandra s absolute timing accuracy is within @xmath18s ( @xcite ) allowing detailed phase comparisons with the radio and @xmath1-ray profiles .",
    "it turns out that the two non - thermal x - ray pulses are aligned with the two @xmath1-ray pulses and two of the three radio pulses ( see also the section about the _ rossi _",
    "x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) pca / hexte timing analyses and figure [ multiprof ] ) given the timing inaccuracies of the instruments .",
    "the random occurrence probability that we are dealing with a 100 - 1000 mev @xmath1-ray profile with a @xmath19 modulation significance _ and _ alignment between the x - ray and @xmath1-ray pulses decreases to about @xmath20 i.e. the significance of the detection of the pulsed @xmath1-ray signal from psr j0218@xmath04232  improves to @xmath21 . for more details on the chandra results ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "rxte observed psr j0218@xmath04232  for about 200 ks between 26 - 12 - 2001 and 7 - 01 - 2002 ( mjd time span 52269  52281 ) . the proportional counter array pca ( 2 - 60 kev ) data were obtained in the good xenon mode , time tagging each event with a @xmath22s time resolution .",
    "the two detector clusters of the high energy x - ray timing experiment hexte ( 10 - 250 kev ) operated in staring mode , and the science mode was e_8us_256_dx1f allowing spectroscopic studies with 256 channels and a time tag resolution of @xmath23s . during the observation period psr j0218@xmath04232  was regularly monitored by the dutch pulsar machine puma ( @xcite ) installed at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) allowing high precision timing studies .      in the timing analysis of the pca data the barycentered event times were folded with the newly obtained wsrt puma ephemeris ( mjd range : 51386  52278 ) as well as with an earlier ephemeris based on timing measurements at jodrell bank ( mjd range : 49092  51462 ) .",
    "no significant differences in the x - ray pulse morphologies were seen folding the events with the different ephemerides .",
    "the modulation significance in the @xmath24-@xmath25 kev window is @xmath26 applying a @xmath27-test : a 30 bin pulse profile is shown in figure [ pca_profile ] .",
    "the two x - ray pulses are located at approximately the same phases as in the cxo hrc - s lightcurve , however , the relative strengths of the pulses have changed .",
    "the pulsed signal can be detected up to @xmath5 kev .",
    "the significances in the @xmath24-@xmath28 kev and @xmath28-@xmath25 kev windows are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , applying again a @xmath27-test . therefore , for the first time significant pulsed emission has been detected at energies beyond @xmath31 kev .",
    "the hexte data were also screened using timeline filters .",
    "pulse - phase folding the event times from the combined cluster a + b screened datasets yielded pulse - phase distributions in 256 pha channels .",
    "the pulsed signal has been detected in the lower pha channels 9  16 , corresponding to 10.3  17.5 kev , reaching a detection significance of @xmath32 .",
    "a compilation of pca / hexte pulse profiles in three different energy windows is shown in figure [ pca_hexte_profiles ] .",
    "it is now also possible to cross - correlate the chandra and rxte profiles in the overlapping energy range .",
    "taking into account the internal delays ( pca 16@xmath33s ; chandra hrc - s 19.5@xmath33s ) we found that the chandra clock runs @xmath34s ahead the rxte clock .",
    "this is a significant improvement upon a previous estimate based on a chandra - rxte correlation study of the much slower rotating crab pulsar , for which absolute timing analysis is further complicated because of irregular dispersion measure variations .",
    "the chandra phases have therefore been adjusted to the rxte profile by applying a back - shift of 0.045 .",
    "figure [ multiprof ] , finally , shows the comparison in absolute phase of the psr j0218@xmath04232  chandra hrc - s and rxte pca x - ray profiles with the radio and @xmath1-ray profiles .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray pulses appear to be aligned within the timing uncertainties with two of the three radio pulses and with the two @xmath1-ray pulses .              in the spectral analysis of the pca data we treated the 5 proportional counter units ( pcu s ) constituting the pca separately .",
    "effective exposure times for the individual pcu s are determined excluding time periods during which an increased background is encountered e.g. during a south atlantic anomaly passage .",
    "moreover , time intervals are ignored when the angle between target and earth horizon is less than @xmath35 or the target aspect angle is larger than @xmath36 .",
    "we further considered only event triggers from the top xenon layer .",
    "response matrices and sensitive areas were derived for each pcu separately using the ftools ( v5.2 , release 18 - 6 - 2002 ) program pcarsp ( v8.0 ) and xtefilt ( v1.7 ) .",
    "next , for each individual pcu pulse - phase histograms have been generated from the screened pcu event datasets in 256 pulse height analyzer ( pha ) channels . in order to determine the pulsed counts from psr j0218@xmath04232  in different pha slices we first made a profile template based on a fit of the total 2 - 16 kev pulse profile in terms of two asymmetric lorentzians atop a flat background .",
    "the two asymmetric lorentzians ( fixed shape and position ) were fitted , each with free normalization , atop a flat background with a free scale to the measured pulse - phase distribution for each selected pha interval .",
    "the sum of the two normalizations constitutes then the total number of pulsed counts per pha interval .",
    "a simple absorbed power - law was fitted to the data using a fixed n@xmath37 of @xmath38 @xmath39 to the combined pcu pulsed counts , taking into account the individual pcu responses and screened exposures .",
    "the best fit total pulsed spectrum has a photon index of @xmath40 over the full pca energy range . using the best fit pca based model templates for the two peaks we also revisited the bepposax total pulsed emission by applying similar fit procedures in different bepposax mecs energy intervals .",
    "we obtained for the mecs energy range a slightly harder photon index of @xmath41 , which is a bit different , but consistent with the earlier reported value of 0.61 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a joint fit of the revisited bepposax mecs and rxte pca spectral measurements yielded a photon - index of @xmath42 over the entire mecs / pca energy range .",
    "similar fit techniques as used for the pca have been employed to determine the number of pulsed counts for selected hexte pha intervals .",
    "the effective hexte cluster a and b exposures have been determined using ftools program hxtdead ( v2.0.0 ) .",
    "the actual exposures are typically reduced by 30% due to deadtime effects .",
    "response matrices and sensitive areas have been derived using ftools program hxtarf ( v1.9 ) taking into account aspect offsets between target and pointing .",
    "the hexte total pulsed counts for given pha slices are not fitted through forward folding assuming a spectral model in view of the limited source count statistics , but instead the count rates are converted to flux values by estimating the effective sensitive area in a certain pha slice assuming a power - law input photon spectrum with index 1 .",
    "this approach yielded one significant flux point for the 10.3 - 17.5 kev energy window and upper - limits beyond this range .",
    "the newly derived rxte pca & hexte and revisited bepposax mecs flux measurements are shown in figure [ he_spectrum ] along with the rosat hri ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) flux point and cgro osse , comptel and egret flux values and upper limits ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the pca flux points are multiplied by 0.81 , because the normalization of the pca spectra turns out to be too high by @xmath43 based on bepposax and rxte pca cross - calibrations ( this work using crab rxte pca data ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "superposed as dotted line is also a recent estimate of the pulsed spectrum of psr j0218@xmath04232  using xmm epic - pn data ( webb , 2003 ) , which nicely overlaps with current flux measurements .",

    ", width=774,height=491 ]    from recently performed chandra and rxte observations of psr j0218@xmath04232  we learned that : a ) the two non - thermal x - ray pulses are aligned with the @xmath1-ray pulses and with two of the three radio pulses , b ) pulsed emission has been detected significantly up to @xmath5 kev , and c ) the x - ray dc component is point - like down to @xmath11 scales with a ( much ) softer spectrum than the pulsed emission .    how unique is psr j0218@xmath04232 ? so far , in x - rays three radio ms - pulsars have been detected showing hard x - ray spectra with narrow pulses and having high x - ray luminosities . a comparison in absolute phase of the x - ray and radio pulse profiles of this small sample , comprised of psr j0218@xmath04232 , psr b1821 - 24  and psr b1937 + 21 , is shown in figure [ prof_comparison ] .",
    "some of the x - ray pulses are clearly aligned with radio pulses , while others are only approximately .",
    "the geometries i.e. the magnetic inclinations and observer / spin - axis angles are very different for these pulsars , implying that we can not draw simple conclusions from the phase comparisons and that 3d modeling of the magnetospheric electro - magnetic output is required using the exact geometry to explain the high - energy and radio profiles .",
    "it can be noted that these three millisecond pulsars are among the top four ranking millisecond pulsars according to their total spin - down luminosity .    in the spectral domain the high - energy pulsed spectra of psr b1821 - 24  and",
    "psr b1937 + 21  could be very similar to that of psr j0218@xmath04232 .",
    "for psr b1821 - 24  we found using archival rxte pca / hexte and asca gis data that the total pulsed spectrum can be described by a power - law with photon index of @xmath45 for the pca ( @xmath46  20 kev ) and @xmath47 for the gis ( @xmath48  10 kev ) .",
    "a joint fit of the asca gis and rxte pca data ( normalization correction of 0.81 applied ) yields a photon - index of @xmath49 assuming an absorbing hydrogen column of @xmath50 @xmath39 .",
    "the total ( i.e. pulsed + dc ) spectrum of psr b1821 - 24  derived recently using cxo acis data can be described by a power - law with photon index @xmath51 ( @xcite ) .",
    "both the photon index and normalization of this total spectrum are consistent with the numbers we determined for the pulsed component alone , leaving little room for a dc - component . at high - energy @xmath1-rays upper - limits",
    "are reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulsed high - energy spectrum of psr b1821 - 24  from soft x - rays up to high - energy @xmath1-rays is shown in figure [ he_spectrum_1821 ] .",
    "the genuine spectrum could be very similar in shape as shown for psr j0218@xmath04232  in figure [ he_spectrum ] .    for psr b1937 + 21",
    "pulsed x - ray emission was detected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured a photon index of @xmath52 for the total spectrum for energies up to 10 kev , but , sofar , at higher x - ray and gamma - ray energies no detections have been reported .",
    "the fact that psr j0218@xmath04232  is at present the only millisecond pulsar detected at gamma - ray energies can be merely due to the `` modest '' sensitivity of previous high - energy instruments for energies above e.g. 30 kev . another reason might be that the present catalog of millisecond radio pulsars is still very incomplete . namely , part of the unidentified high - energy gamma - ray sources in the cos - b ( @xcite ) and egret ( @xcite ) catalogues might have as counterparts millisecond pulsars which have been missed sofar in radio searches .",
    "the high - energy spectrum measured for psr j0218@xmath04232  ( hard x - ray and soft high - energy gamma - ray spectrum ) is indeed reminiscent of that inferred for part of these unidentified sources and there are not many other candidate counterparts for the stable unidentified gamma - ray sources , excluding millisecond pulsars and normal radio pulsars .",
    "therefore : 1 ) millisecond pulsars with hard x - ray spectra are good candidates for detection with future gamma - ray telescopes ( e.g. with the recently launched esa satellite integral , sensitive between 15 kev and 5 mev , and the future italian mission agile and nasa s glast , both sensitive to gamma rays with energies above about 30 mev ) ; 2 ) accurate source localization of unidentified gamma - ray sources with future gamma - ray missions might lead to detections of new millisecond pulsars at radio wavelengths , followed by the identification of the pulsed signals in the x - ray and gamma - ray data .      total pulsed high - energy spectrum of psr b1821 - 24  in a @xmath44 representation from soft x - rays up to high - energy @xmath1-rays .",
