    "the investigation of the nucleon structure in the framework of qcd is a major task in today s particle physics .",
    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) have opened new ways of studying the complex interplay of longitudinal momentum and transverse coordinate space as well as spin and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom in the nucleon .",
    "the twist-2 gpds @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 of quarks in the nucleon are defined by the following parameterization of off - forward nucleon matrix elements @xmath4 for the helicity independent vector case , and @xmath5 for the helicity dependent axial vector case @xcite .",
    "wilson lines ensuring gauge invariance of the bilocal operators are denoted by @xmath6 . here and",
    "in the following we do not show explicitly the dependence of the gpds on the resolution scale @xmath7 .",
    "fig.([fig : gpds ] ) shows the definition of the particle momenta and helicities .",
    "the momentum transfer ( squared ) is given by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "using the light cone vector @xmath10 we define the longitudinal momentum transfer by @xmath11 .",
    "the proper definition of the twist-2 tensor or quark helicity flip gpds @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be found in @xcite .",
    "gpds provide a solid framework in qcd to relate many different aspects of hadron pyhsics :    * the forward limit @xmath16 of certain gpds reproduces the well known parton distributions , that is @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . * the integral over the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath20 of the gpds gives the dirac , pauli , axial , pseudo - scalar , tensor etc .",
    "form factors , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 etc .",
    "* the fourier transforms @xmath26 of the gpds @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath12 at @xmath27 are coordinate space probability densities in the impact parameter @xmath28 @xcite . *",
    "the forward limit of the @xmath29-moment of the gpd @xmath1 , @xmath30 , allows for the determination of the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the nucleon spin , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the quark momentum fraction .",
    "the fact that the impact parameter dependent quark distributions like @xmath33 have the interpretation of probability densities in the transverse plane marks a major step forward in the understanding of the nucleon structure .",
    "a very interesting observation in this respect is that at large longitudinal momentum fraction , @xmath34 , i.e. when the active parton carries the whole nucleon momentum and the spectators give only a negligible contribution , the active parton becomes the center of momentum of the nucleon at @xmath35 .",
    "accordingly , the impact parameter profile of the nucleon will be strongly peaked at @xmath36 .",
    "keeping in mind that the parton distributions eventually vanish in the limit @xmath34 , we expect that @xmath37 .",
    "transferred to momentum space , we have the striking prediction that the normalized gpd @xmath38 will be constant in the limit @xmath34@xcite .",
    "interesting recent results on gpds using available experimental data on form factors and pdfs can be found in @xcite .    on the lattice side",
    ", we can not deal directly with matrix elements of bilocal light - cone operators .",
    "therefore we first transform the lhs in eqs.([vectorop],[axialvectorop ] ) to mellin space by integrating over @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "this results in matrix elements of towers of local operators which are in turn parameterized in terms of so - called generalized form factors ( gffs ) @xmath40 , @xmath41 where the subtraction of traces is implicit .",
    "the explicit parameterization for the tower of vector operators , @xmath42 , is given in @xcite in terms of the gffs @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in the axial vector case , the corresponding expression in terms of the gffs @xmath45 and @xmath46 is shown in @xcite .",
    "parameterizations for the tensor gpds have been derived recently in @xcite .",
    "having computed the gffs in e.g. lattice qcd , it is fairly simple to get the moments of the corresponding gpds by using the following polynomial relations @xcite @xmath47 in the limit @xmath48 , the complete nucleon structure related to @xmath0 and @xmath2 is according to eq.([invv ] ) represented by the sets of gffs @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the lattice calculation and extraction of the gffs from nucleon two- and three - point - functions follows the standard procedure as outlined in e.g. @xcite .",
    "our dynamical computations are currently based on a set of coupling- and quark mass - combinations with up to @xmath52 configurations and with pion masses ranging from @xmath53 down to @xmath54 gev .",
    "the lattice spacing lies in between @xmath55 and @xmath56 fm .",
    "since we are using non - perturbatively @xmath57 improved wilson fermions , we do not expect strong discretization effects @xcite .",
    "a list of the parameters is given in fig.([fig : para ] ) .",
    "we do not take into account the disconnected contributions which are numerically much harder to evaluate .",
    "this is irrelevant as long as we concentrate on the iso - vector channel @xmath58 ( as we do here ) , for which the disconnected pieces would cancel due to iso - spin symmetry .    to give an overview of our results we show in fig.([fig : first13550 ] ) the lowest three moments of the gpds @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 as well as the lowest two moments of @xmath62 .",
    "up to now , only the lowest moments @xmath63 which we show here are non - perturbatively renormalized , and operator mixing has to be taken into account for a proper renormalization of the @xmath64-moments for @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "we do not expect the renormalization to affect the following general discussion and the extraction of the dipole masses below .",
    "please note that for reasons of clarity @xmath66 has been shifted upwards by @xmath67 , as indicated by the superscript arrow in fig.([fig : first13550 ] ) , lower left panel .",
    "all gffs have been fitted using a standard dipole ansatz , @xmath68 except for the pseudo - scalar ff @xmath69 , where we used a dipole ansatz including the pion - pole , @xmath70 the fits given by the gray bands in figs.([fig : first13550 ] ) show an overall satisfactory description of the lattice numbers .",
    "while the statistical errors for the lowest two moments are rather small , they tend to be somewhat larger for the @xmath64-moment .",
    "the statistics are particularly poor for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the @xmath73 gffs , which are not shown in this work .",
    "it turns out that the moments of @xmath0 and @xmath2 in the iso - vector channel are a factor of @xmath74 smaller than the corresponding moments of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , while @xmath75 which contributes to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 is compatible with zero .",
    "our results indicate furthermore strong cancellations of @xmath76 and @xmath77 flavor contributions in the iso - singlet channel for the helicity independent gpd @xmath78 .",
    "let us now take a look at the @xmath79-dependence of the gpds and the impact parameter dependent quark distribution @xmath80 .",
    "the observation from section ( [ intro ] ) that @xmath81 translates directly to the statement that the gffs @xmath49 become constant for very large @xmath10 since increasingly more weight lies on values of @xmath29 close to one for @xmath82 . to be precise",
    ", we expect that @xmath83 , independent of @xmath79 .",
    "since the values for the momentum transfer squared in our computation are unevenly distributed in the interval @xmath84 gev , and since there is in particular a gap between @xmath85 and the smallest non - zero @xmath79 which can be realized on the given lattices , @xmath86 , it is not useful to perform a discrete fourier transformation ( ft ) of our results to impact parameter space .",
    "instead , we directly use the continuous ft of the dipole ansatz eq.([dipole ] ) .",
    "the normalized impact parameter dependent moments @xmath87 with @xmath88 are shown in fig.([fig : impact ] ) . for reasons of comparison",
    "we show in fig.([fig : impact ] ) also the corresponding gffs , normalized to @xmath89 .",
    "the gray bands in the impact parameter plot reflect the errors associated with the dipole masses , @xmath90 .",
    "the results in fig.([fig : impact ] ) show very nicely the anticipated flattening of the gffs and the narrowing of the corresponding distributions in impact parameter space , going from @xmath63 to @xmath91 .",
    "this flattening of the gpds has first been observed in @xcite .",
    "since we have results for a large number of pion masses at hand , it is mandatory to concentrate in the following on the important issue of the @xmath92 dependence and the chiral extrapolation of our calculation . due to the use of wilson fermions , the dominant part of our computation is for pion masses above @xmath93 mev where chiral perturbation theory in its current form is most probably not applicable . in particular for the dipole masses",
    "@xmath94 , we therefore resort to a purely phenomenologically motivated pion mass dependence of the form @xmath95 .",
    "we have checked that a linear dependence on @xmath92 is clearly unfavored by our results .    for the following analysis",
    "we have normalized our results to @xmath96 first .",
    "one option is then to perform dipole fits for all individual @xmath97 , @xmath98 combinations for a given moment @xmath10 and fit the pion mass dependence of the dipole masses with the given ansatz .",
    "however to optimally utilize the information on the dipole masses from our collection of results , it is better to use a combined dipole - mass / pion - mass fit of the simple form @xmath99 depending on the two parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "having done the fit , we may shift the raw numbers to a common curve given by eq.([chiraldipole ] ) at the physical pion mass , @xmath102 mev .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in fig.([fig : alldata1 ] ) for the gffs @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "the fit parameters are found to be @xmath106 although the corresponding rather large error does not allow for a definite conclusion , it is interesting to note that the slope @xmath101 changes sign going from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "we observe an overall nice clustering of the lattice points in fig.([fig : alldata1 ] ) much in favor of our ansatz eq.([chiraldipole ] ) .",
    "the actual fits are given by the gray bands and show a very good @xmath109 lying below @xmath110 for the helicity independent and below @xmath111 for the helicity dependent case . in particular for @xmath104 , a small fraction of the lattice points seem to be significantly below the main line .",
    "future investigations have to show if this is due to an unaccounted dependence on the lattice spacing , the ( finite ) lattice volume or just insufficient statistics .",
    "an attempt to compare our results for the axial and tensor coupling , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , with chiral perturbation theory is described in @xcite .",
    "we plan to extract the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the nucleon spin as soon as the missing renormalization constants become available .",
    "we have computed the lowest moments of gpds for a number of different pion masses in the range above @xmath114 mev .",
    "the results are very well described by a combined dipole - mass / pion - mass fit .",
    "while we observe no sign of chiral logarithms in the available range of pion masses , let us note that first promising lattice calculations towards the chiral region are currently under way using overlap @xcite as well as domain wall fermions @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed on the hitachi sr8000 at lrz ( munich ) , on the cray t3e at epcc ( edinburgh ) and on the apemille at nic / desy ( zeuthen ) .",
