    "@xmath3_{5/2}}$ ] transition must be performed in order to return ions that reach this dark state to the cooling cycle .    due to the need for lasers to repump ions to the ground state from the metastable states discussed above , it is also important that these lasers can be stabilised to the transitions in question in order to counter the effects of frequency drift .",
    "we have previously demonstrated long - term absolute frequency stabilisation to ions in a discharge by employing the dichroic atomic vapor laser locking ( davll ) method @xcite .",
    "the frequency shift of the transition due to the hyperfine structure and isotope of yb@xmath2 is important when tuning or stabilising a laser to the transition .",
    "also , due to the difficulty of theoretical predictions of such shifts on excited to excited state transitions such as this one , experimental determination of the shifts can provide a useful test of the theoretical methods that can be used to predict them .",
    "thus it is necessary to perform spectroscopy in order to determine the relevant isotope shift and hyperfine structure constants .",
    "optogalvanic spectroscopy is an alternative method for investigating ion transitions in a discharge .",
    "the electrical properties of the plasma are dependent on the electronic state populations of atoms and ions in the plasma .",
    "when the plasma is illuminated by a laser resonant with a transition , the change in plasma resistance yields a measurable signal .",
    "this method allows for electrical detection of atomic transitions , resulting in far greater sensitivity than optical methods such absorption .",
    "this provides a particular advantage in studying transitions from metastable states such as we do in this paper , where the spectroscopic signal can be quite weak due to the limited population of these states .",
    "the necessary metastable states can be populated by collisions in the discharge @xcite .",
    "in this paper we measure the optogalvanic spectra of the 638.6 nm @xmath0  @xmath3_{5/2}}$ ] and 935.2 nm @xmath1  @xmath4_{1/2}}$ ] transitions .",
    "we also provide a bound on isotope splitting for the 638.6 nm transition and show that the hyperfine constant is consistent with theory .",

    ", we obtain well - resolved isotopic and hyperfine lines , extending the measurements made by sugiyama et al @xcite .",
    "we performed optogalvanic spectroscopy in yb hollow - cathode lamps containing ne buffer gas at pressures of 6.7 mbar and 0.67 mbar .",
    "all hollow - cathode discharges used had the same geometry .",
    "the 6.7 mbar discharge was generated in a sealed hamamatsu l2783 - 70ne - yb hollow cathode lamp , and was used to perform spectroscopy on both metastable transitions of interest .",
    "a second purpose - built discharge was prepared inside a vacuum chamber , intended to allow for variation in the buffer gas pressure within the discharge with the purpose of operation at 0.67 mbar .",
    "this was done in order to see an expected @xmath14 reduction in pressure broadening .",
    "the chamber was evacuated directly by a rotary vacuum pump and vacuum pressure was monitored by a thermocouple gauge , sensitive down to @xmath15 mbar .",
    "after evacuation , the chamber was baked at 180c over a period of 23 days . at this point , a base pressure of 0.013 mbar was attained .",
    "a noble buffer gas was then able to be introduced via a needle valve .",
    "the buffer gas pressure was monitored with a thermocouple gauge .",
    "sanyo dl5038 - 021 laser diodes were tuned for use at 638.6 nm using temperature and operating current .",
    "behaviour close to the desired wavelength varied largely from diode to diode .",
    "the diodes were operated without an external cavity , running single - frequency with a linewidth less than 30 mhz , where the output was optically isolated to prevent optical feedback and damage to the diode .",
    "a fabry - perot etalon with an fsr of 300 mhz was used as a relative frequency reference to measure the frequency splittings and peak widths of the measured spectrum .",
    "absolute wavelength measurement for tuning purposes was performed using a highfinesse ws5 - 332 wavemeter with @xmath16 nm accuracy .",
    "the implementation of the setup for optogalvanic spectroscopy followed the schematic shown in figure [ flo : ld : ogssetup ] .",
    "[ flo : ld : ogssetup ]    the 935.2 nm spectroscopy setup was similar to that for the 638.6 nm line . a single mode tuneable external cavity laser was constructed with an axcell photonics laser diode ( m9 - 935 - 0200-s30 ) and a 1200 g / mm holographic grating .",
    "the frequency was continuously tuneable over a range of 13.7 ghz by tuning the external cavity length with a piezo - electric actuator and synchronously varying the laser diode current .",
    "the laser spectral mode quality was monitored with a confocal fabry - perot spectrometer with a free spectral range of @xmath17 mhz and a finesse of 11 .",
    "the observed spectrum bounds the 935.2 nm laser linewidth to below 50 mhz , though linewidths of a few mhz are typical for this laser configuration .",
    "the absolute wavelength was measured with a burleigh wa-1100 wavemeter ( accuracy @xmath16 nm ) .",
    "the 935.2 nm light was fibre coupled for delivery to the sealed discharge lamp .",
    "this provided 19 mw of 935.2 nm power at the discharge lamp in a laser beam spot with a diameter of @xmath18 mm ( 1/e@xmath19 ) , corresponding to a maximum intensity of @xmath20 @xmath21 .    in order for the optogalvanic signal",
    "to be distinguished from the electronic background noise , the optical beam was modulated at a set reference frequency using either amplitude or frequency modulation .",
    "we demodulated the signal using lock - in detection .",
    "a significant advantage of this method is that it allows for removal of @xmath22 noise , which would otherwise dominate the signal , allowing a high signal - to - noise ratio to be obtained . in these experiments we chopped the beam with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , switching the beam intensity between zero and maximum intensity .",
    "we obtained optogalvanic spectra from discharge lamps operating with a discharge current of 3 ma at 6.7 mbar and 2 ma at 0.67 mbar , for which the maximum signal amplitude was obtained .",
    "the 638.6 nm laser power used at the lamp was 1013 mw , chopped at a modulation frequency of 10 khz .",
    "the signals for both the sealed 6.7 mbar discharge and the low - pressure 0.67 mbar discharge with ne buffer gas are shown in figure [ flo : ld : ogspectra1 ] .",
    "the linewidth of the signal obtained at a buffer gas pressure of 6.7 mbar was found to be approximately 1.9 ghz ( fwhm ) .",
    "the observed linewidth decreases to approximately 1.5 ghz as the pressure is reduced to 0.67 mbar .",
    "there is some structure in the low - pressure peak that could be attributed to the splitting of the 638.6 nm line .",
    "the frequency axis of the plots is determined by taking the frequency spacing of fabry - perot transmission peaks to be equal to the fabry - perot fsr .",
    "the optogalvanic signal amplitude was measured for a range of optical powers producing the saturation curve shown in figure [ flo : ld : satcurves ] .",
    "a pure pressure broadening model predicts a signal at maximum amplitude of the form @xmath23 to describe the effect of saturation on the optogalvanic signal , where the saturation parameter @xmath24 is the ratio of optical intensity to the saturation value and @xmath25 is the signal amplitude @xcite .",
    "the saturation intensity @xmath26 is dependent on the homogeneous linewidth @xmath27 as shown by@xmath28 where the homogeneous linewidth varies linearly with the pressure @xmath29 according to the stern - vollmer equation @xmath30 for constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "figure [ flo : ld : satcurves ] shows experimental data on the saturation of optogalvanic response .",
    "the signals were fitted with equation and the slopes near zero intensity have been normalised for ease of comparison .",
    "the measured optical power is combined with the beam waist size @xmath33 inside the discharge to give the optical intensity , and hence allow calculation of the saturation intensity @xmath26 for each measured curve .    a beam profiling camera was used to find the @xmath34 beam radius @xmath33 inside the 6.7 mbar discharge to be 730 @xmath35 , resulting in an estimated saturation intensity of @xmath36 .",
    "the 0.67 mbar discharge had a saturation intensity of @xmath37 from the fitted saturation curve , where the measured beam waist @xmath33 was 1.01 mm .",
    "as the effects of inhomogeneous broadening on the saturation behaviour can not be ruled out , these values for the saturation intensity are upper bounds .",
    "using equation and the calculated saturation intensities gives maximum homogeneous linewidth estimates of @xmath38 for the 6.7 mbar discharge , and @xmath39 for the measurements of the 0.67 mbar discharge .",
    "the difference between the linewidths in the high- and low - pressure discharges is @xmath40 , which agrees with the difference in total linewidths measured from the spectra .",
    "this gives values for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 coefficients , such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the value for @xmath31 is the remaining broadening not induced by pressure , whilst @xmath32 is a property of the discharge and buffer gas used .",
    "the vacuum system used to construct the low- pressure discharge allowed for use of different buffer gases in place of ne .",
    "ar buffer gas was shown to generate yb@xmath43 ions , using a uv spectrometer to observe fluorescence from the 369.5 nm line to confirm this for our apparatus .",
    "however whilst martensson - pendrill et al",
    ". demonstrated optogalvanic spectroscopy of the 369.5 nm @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 line using ar buffer gas @xcite , we were unable to observe an optogalvanic signal from the 638.6 nm transition .",
    "no such issue occurred with a ne buffer gas , allowing for both yb@xmath43 generation and the expected optogalvanic response .",
    "the strong ne * transition line at 638.47 nm near the 638.6 nm yb@xmath43 transition did not appear to compromise the measurement . we observed a dc offset in the optogalvanic response at the 638.6 nm line , attributed to the wings of the extremely strong ne * line .",
    "an optogalvanic spectrum with resolved isotope splittings was measured for the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath4_{1/2}}$ ] transition at 935.2 nm in the sealed discharge lamp .",
    "overlapping spectra were taken to measure the response over the 25.4 ghz span from 935.159 to 925.233 nm .",
    "figure [ flo : spectrum935 ] shows a 10 ghz span encompassing the observed peaks , taken with 18 mw of 935.2 nm laser power and amplitude modulated at 20 khz . in these measurements ,",
    "the optogalvanic signal increased monotonically with current , so the maximum rated lamp current of 10 ma was used .",
    "the four predominant peaks occurred at wavelengths of 935.173 , 935.180 , 935.187 , and 935.197 nm .",
    "no peaks were observed outside of the region shown in figure [ flo : spectrum935 ] and the spectra is in qualitative agreement with previously published work @xcite . the hyperfine structure of yb@xmath2 171 and 173 can be seen to overlap with the peaks from 174,172 , and 170 . from measurements in trapped ions",
    "@xcite the yb@xmath2 172 transition is known to be only @xmath44 mhz from the @xmath45 transition of yb@xmath2 171 . combined with the known hyperfine splitting of yb@xmath2 171",
    "allows the assignment of these features .",
    "a fwhm of @xmath46 mhz was measured on the 176 peak and is representative of the single isotope broadening .",
    "this peak is free from distortions induced by overlap between peaks due to the hyperfine splittings in yb@xmath2 171 and 173 .",
    "the integrated optogalvanic signal over the yb@xmath2 176 peak is @xmath47% of the total integrated signal , consistent with the natural abundance of 12.7% .",
    "other peak assignments were verified through a combination of known wavelengths and hyperfine splittings from trapped ion experiments and weighting based on natural abundance and clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "we measure a splitting between the 174/172 peaks of @xmath48 ghz and a splitting of @xmath49 ghz between the 174/176 peaks .",
    "this gives an average isotope shift of @xmath50 ghz / nucleon .",
    "the optogalvanic signal showed a linear dependence in laser power for 2.5 mw to 18 mw with no evidence of saturation . changing",
    "the lamp current from 3 ma to 14 ma also produced a linear increase in signal .",
    "similar optogalvanic spectra were observed with a blind hollow cathode lamp ( cathodeon 3ux yb , ne buffer gas ) . with a lock - in amplifier time constant of @xmath51 ms",
    "the maximum signal to noise observed was 58 .",
    "hyperfine and isotope splitting have strong effects on the optogalvanic lineshape .",
    "in the case of the 935.2 nm transition , the splitting due to these effects is well resolved .",
    "previous spectroscopic work on this transition also gives a good idea of the composition of the expected spectrum @xcite .    in the case of the 638.6 nm transition ,",
    "the broadening of the transition linewidth due to homogeneous and inhomogeneous sources makes resolution of the splitting difficult . using theoretical estimates ,",
    "the splitting spectrum that we expect to observe for the 638.6 nm in the well - resolved limit would contain 5 strong lines .",
    "this is based on the natural isotopic abundance of yb@xmath2 and the fact that the large number of hyperfine levels for @xmath6 173 ( @xmath52 ) will be far weaker in intensity than the transition lines for the 171 , 172 , 174 and 176 isotopes @xcite .",
    "we theoretically estimate the hyperfine splitting to be several ghz for @xmath6 171 .",
    "the hyperfine splitting of the yb@xmath2 isotopes with even mass numbers will be zero , as these isotopes carry no nuclear spin .",
    "although broadening of the linewidth prevents clear resolution of hyperfine and isotope structure , deviation from the gaussian shape on the higher - frequency side of the spectrum at the higher pressure of 6.7 mbar shows discernible structure in the observed peak .",
    "hints of further structure become evident in the main peak at the lower pressure of 0.67 mbar , suggesting that this main peak is made up of several broadened lines .    as stated in section [ sec:638 results ] , we obtained a @xmath40 difference between the maximum homogeneous linewidths in the 6.7 mbar and 0.67 mbar discharges from measurements of signal saturation .",
    "this agrees with the 0.4 ghz difference in total linewidth measured from the optogalvanic spectra , showing that the absolute difference is dominantly due to pressure broadening .",
    "however , as the achieved reduction in linewidth is significantly less than the expected factor of @xmath14 for pressure broadening , there is evidently another source of broadening .",
    "the residual pressure broadening at 0.67 mbar is @xmath53 mhz , given that the expected linear relationship holds .",
    "the contribution of power broadening on the line - width of the optogalvanic transition can be estimated to be @xmath54 mhz , by estimating a natural linewidth on the order of 10 mhz .",
    "the lack of any significant contribution by power broadening was also confirmed by illuminating the discharge with powers of less than 1 mw and finding no noticeable difference in linewidth .    from the analysis above ,",
    "it is evident that doppler broadening is the only possible remaining broadening mechanism for the low - pressure measurements of the 638.6 nm line .",
    "the residual linewidth of the 638.6 nm transition appears to arise from the overlap of multiple unresolved doppler - broadened lines .",
    "the temperature associated with a given doppler linewidth is given by@xmath55 for atoms of mass @xmath56 and a doppler - broadened fwhm linewidth @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "results in the literature suggest that an expected temperature for a hollow - cathode discharge is 300 k , which would equate to a doppler linewidth of approximately 440 mhz at 638.6 nm @xcite .",
    "this level of doppler broadening corresponds well with the optogalvanic spectrum in figure [ flo : ld : ogspectra1 ] observed at 0.67 mbar , being at a level where multiple lines spaced by @xmath58 ghz are not be fully resolved .",
    "this lends weight to the possibility of structure observed in the low - pressure optogalvanic spectrum .",
    "preliminary calculations of hyperfine structure were performed by dr .",
    "w. m. itano of the national institute of standards and technology , boulder , co , usa . the hyperfine @xmath59 and @xmath60 constants of the @xmath3_{5/2}}$ ] state and the @xmath0 state have been estimated by a multiconfiguration dirac - hartree - fock method , utilising the grasp package of atomic structure programs @xcite .",
    "the method is similar to the cross - optimisation method used to calculate the hyperfine structure of the hg@xmath43 ion @xcite , in which orbitals are optimised , stepwise , on different configurations .    at each step ,",
    "the previously optimised orbitals are held fixed .",
    "in the first step , the @xmath61 @xmath62 core orbitals and @xmath63 valence orbitals are variationally optimised on the @xmath64 levels of the @xmath65 configuration .",
    "next , keeping the previously optimised orbitals fixed , the @xmath66 orbitals are determined by minimising the energy of the ground state , which is @xmath67 in a first approximation .",
    "the @xmath68 orbital is optimised on the @xmath69 levels .",
    "the @xmath70 orbital is optimised on the @xmath71 levels . in the final step ,",
    "the @xmath72 orbitals are optimised on the lowest - energy odd - parity @xmath73 levels .",
    "this set of orbitals is used to generate a set of basis states by making single and double replacements from a set of reference configurations .",
    "the final approximate wavefunctions are calculated by relativistic configuration - interaction , i.e. by diagonalising the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian matrix in this basis .",
    "the hyperfine constants are evaluated by evaluating the expectation values of the hyperfine energy operators in these wavefunctions .    for the @xmath3_{5/2}}$ ] state , @xmath74 mhz , @xmath75 mhz , and @xmath76 mhz . for the @xmath0 state ,",
    "@xmath77 mhz , @xmath78 mhz , and @xmath79 mhz .",
    "the only one of these constants for which there is an experimental measurement is @xmath80 mhz @xcite , measured for the @xmath0 state , which is about 20% lower than the calculated value .",
    "our data is consistent with the splitting for the @xmath3_{5/2}}$ ] state being much smaller than the @xmath0 state splitting , agreeing with dr .",
    "itano s theoretical estimate .",
    "no theoretical results are available for the isotope shift of the 638.6 nm transition , but the normal mass shift is known to be small ( on the order of a few mhz ) . the specific mass shift and field shift however are known to be far larger , providing the dominant contribution to the isotope shift .",
    "we can put an upper limit of approximately 375 mhz / nucleon on the isotope shift , given that there are at least three equally - spaced strong lines in the main peak with a combined linewidth of 1.5 ghz . the poorly resolved features in the low - pressure spectrum have approximately a 750 mhz spacing and could correspond to the isotopes 172 , 174 and 176 of yb@xmath2 .",
    "the interpretation of the 935.2 nm transition optogalvanic spectra is substantially less complicated than that for 638.6 nm transition .",
    "the transition wavelengths for all isotopes excepting 168 ( abundance 0.13% ) and 173 have previously been measured in trapped ion experiments .",
    "our estimate of the isotope shift for the @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath4_{1/2}}$ ] transition is in agreement with the @xmath81 ghz / nucleon from previous discharge lamp work @xcite .",
    "the small discrepancy between our measurement of @xmath50 ghz / nucleon and the @xmath82 ghz / nucleon from measurements in single trapped ions @xcite is most likely due to shifts induced in the lamp measurements by overlap of the 170 , 172 and 174 isotope peaks with the hyperfine structure of yb@xmath2 171 and 173 .",
    "agreement between the optogalvanic peaks and the published transition wavelengths for specific isotopes allows us to bound the overall lamp pressure shift as @xmath83 @xmath84 , limited by the absolute accuracy of our wavemeter .",
    "we also place an upper limit of @xmath85 @xmath84 on the pressure broadening coefficient @xmath32 for this transition , assuming that the linewidth of the yb@xmath2 176 line is entirely due to pressure broadening .",
    "the prospects for long term frequency stabilisation to the 935.2 nm optogalvanic signal are encouraging given the observed signal to noise ratio of 58 for sub - second averaging .",
    "we have measured the optogalvanic response of the 638.6 nm @xmath0  @xmath3_{5/2}}$ ] and 935.2 nm @xmath1  @xmath4_{1/2}}$ ] transitions in singly ionised yb@xmath2 .",
    "we observe linewidths of 1.9 ghz and 1.5 ghz for the 638.6 nm optogalvanic peak , using discharges with 6.7 mbar and 0.67 mbar of ne buffer gas , respectively , where doppler broadening is expected to be the cause of these large linewidths and the inability to resolve the splittings .",
    "we performed measurements of the saturation curves in both pressure regimes , calculating the pressure broadening coefficient to be @xmath5 , and confirming that the source of the remaining broadening is inhomogeneous .",
    "the broadening prevents full resolution of transition lines in the main spectral peak , however our data is consistent with a much larger splitting of the @xmath0 state than the @xmath3_{5/2}}$ ] state , as predicted by our theoretical estimate .",
    "we can provide an upper limit to the isotope splitting of approximately 375 mhz / nucleon . in our measurements of the 935.2 nm optogalvanic spectrum , we resolve with high signal - to - noise the peaks of the dominant isotopes of @xmath6 .",
