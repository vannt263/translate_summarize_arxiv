    "since the first observation of spin-1 @xmath0na bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the optical trap @xcite , bose gas with spin degrees of freedom , called the spinor bose gas @xcite , becomes one of the central topics in cold atomic physics .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom permit a variety of additional exotic phenomena to be manifest .",
    "considerable experimental and theoretical works have been dedicated to investigating static or dynamic properties relevant to spins of the condensate , including magnetic ordering @xcite , coherent spin - dynamics @xcite , spin - domains or textures @xcite and so on .",
    "in addition , a number of researchers have laid eyes on finite - temperature properties of spinor bosons , especially on the bec phenomenon itself @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensation in a free spin-1 bose gas has ever been studied by yamada @xcite , simkin and cohen @xcite .",
    "the obtained results suggest that the bose gas is more sensitive to external magnetic field than a fermi gas and the bec temperature rises up with the magnetic field due to the zeeman effect .",
    "if there are ferromagnetic ( fm ) couplings between atoms , bec occurs in a more fascinating way because the fm coupling induces a new phase transition , the fm transition @xcite .",
    "its critical temperature is called the curie point .",
    "it is already demonstrated that the curie point is never below the bec temperature and both critical points are increased by the fm coupling @xcite .",
    "these conclusions have also been confirmed by other groups @xcite .",
    "moreover , bose - einstein condensation in an optically trapped spinor bose gas has been elaborately studied @xcite .    in the present study ,",
    "we concentrate on the bose - einstein condensation in an @xmath1 spinor bose gas by considering quadratic zeeman effect ( qze ) . as stenger",
    "et al . indicated @xcite , the zeeman energy of a spin-1 bose atom is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 refers to the spin-@xmath4 index of hyperfine state @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 to the magnetic field , and @xmath8 to the zeeman energy of the @xmath9 state .",
    "the second term represents the linear zeeman splitting and the last term arises from the quadratic zeeman effect . for a spinor atom , the quadratic zeeman effect can not be neglected due to the hyperfine structure @xcite .",
    "very recently it is found that the qze can even be induced by the dipole trap , which is used to confine cold atoms experimentally , for the spinor atom @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the qze plays an important role for the understanding of spinor atomic bosons , especially in strong magnetic field .",
    "various of effects caused by the quadratic zeeman shift have been reported in recent years .",
    "it , together with the linear zeeman effect and spin - dependant interactions , can not only lead to a number of novel ground states @xcite , but also affects significantly on spin dynamics @xcite of the spinor condensates .",
    "the spin dynamics is dramatically suppressed in magnetic field , owing to the quadratic zeeman splitting .",
    "the qze can also influence on the vortex state , and bring about new type vortex states in spinor condensates @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we aim at discussing the bose - einstein condensation of the spin-1 bose gas .",
    "interestingly , we show that the qze can induce reentrance of bec in the bose gas .",
    "the spin-1 bose gas is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath11,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the field annihilation operator for an atom in hyperfine state @xmath13 at point @xmath14 . the first term represents kinetic energy .",
    "the terms with coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the spin - independent and spin - dependent interactions , respectively .",
    "the forth and fifth terms describe the linear and quadratic zeeman effects , respectively .",
    "we suppose that the linear zeeman coefficient @xmath17 is always positive hereinafter , but the quadratic zeeman coefficient @xmath18 can be either positive or negative .",
    "@xmath19 is a vector which consists of three components of the @xmath20 pauli spin-1 matrices@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we calculate the condensation temperature and the condensate fraction of homogenous spinor gases in the external magnetic field . the reentrance phenomenon is observed in case of @xmath21 and a detail explanation is given on how it is induced by the quadratic zeeman effect in a free gas . the sec .",
    "iii extends the study to the trapped interacting gases .",
    "the interaction between atoms is treated by using a mean - field approach .",
    "it is suggested that the interaction tends to decrease the condensation temperature , but the reentrance phenomenon sustains .",
    "the last section gives a brief summary .",
    "first we consider a free spin-1 bose gas , ignoring the interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "then the effective hamiltonian for the grand canonical ensemble reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the kinetic energy of free particles with mass @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the chemical potential , and @xmath26 is the operator of total particle number .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) for each given temperature . at @xmath37 , atoms lying on the lowest energy sub - level begin to condense . in order to determine @xmath37",
    ", one have to make it clear which sub - level is the lowest first . from eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) it is easy to see that the energy level for the @xmath40 state is lower than the other two as long as the external magnetic field @xmath7 is sufficiently weak , so the @xmath41 atoms condense once the temperature is below @xmath37 .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath39 satisfies the equation @xmath42 above @xmath43 , and @xmath44 at and below @xmath43 .",

    "after dropping to a minimum value at @xmath64 , it grows up again . during the temperature range of @xmath65 to @xmath66 , a typical reentrant phenomenon of bec induced by the magnetic field @xmath7",

    "<S> we calculate the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) temperature of spin-1 atomic bosons in external magnetic field , taking into account the influence of the quadratic zeeman effect . in case </S>",
    "<S> that the quadratic zeeman coefficient is positive , the bec temperature exhibits a nontrivial dependance on the magnetic field and a magnetic - field - induced reentrant phenomenon of bec is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon could be well understood by the competition between the linear and quadratic zeeman effects . </S>",
    "<S> reentrance of bec in a trapped spinor bose gas is also discussed . </S>"
