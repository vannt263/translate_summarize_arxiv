    "thus for small values of @xmath227 , @xmath223 is negligibly small .",
    "however , @xmath93 remains unchanged .",
    "therefore @xmath134 ( in eq.(34 ) ) reduces to @xmath228 and hence @xmath134 becomes independent of the control field for latexmath:[$|g_1| \\gg    for any arbitrary value of @xmath218 ; e.g. for @xmath230 , @xmath231 for any @xmath218 ( results not shown here ) . however changing the magnetic field , the @xmath134 structure shifts along @xmath151 and @xmath134 curve is symmetric about @xmath218 .",
    "therefore by choosing proper magnetic field , one can produce large @xmath134 and enhancement of @xmath134 at the required probe frequency regions .",
    "doppler broadened case : *    we further consider the enhancement of mor in the doppler broadened medium with the fields @xmath232 and @xmath186 in two - photon resonance condition , where @xmath233 . under this condition @xmath86 in eq . (",
    "27 ) is modified which contains the control field parameters but @xmath116 remains unchanged .",
    "further in the limit @xmath234 , one can show that @xmath86 becomes equal to the corresponding stationary atom value of @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ sp_2ph ] ) .",
    "however , note that @xmath116 [ in eq .",
    "( [ chiavm ] ) ] is still velocity dependent . in the above limit",
    ", large power broadening is introduced in @xmath235 and amplitude of @xmath156 is reduced . however , this turns out to be advantageous , particularly because large asymmetry is created between re @xmath156 and re @xmath236 around @xmath237 .",
    "moreover the absorption i m @xmath238 becomes extremely small . since @xmath236 is doppler broadened and @xmath156 is reasonably small and flat for a broad range of @xmath151 , one obtains _",
    "large enhancement of @xmath134 for a broad range of probe frequencies compared to the homogeneously broadened case_. further , mor in two - photon resonance condition turns out to be advantageous for smaller magnetic fields where very large enhancement of mor is obtained .",
    "in summary , we have shown how a control field can be used to control birefringence and hence enhance mor in a doppler broadened medium .",
    "we have shown how control laser can modify the susceptibilities and hence result significantly large mor in frequency regions , where mor otherwise is small .",
    "the key to large enhancement of mor consists of utilizing the large asymmetry in the susceptibilities caused by the autler - townes splitting .",
    "we have derived conditions to select frequency regions where one can obtain large mor .",
    "the most useful regions are found to be at the probe frequencies - where absorptions of both the circularly polarized components are negligible and the associated dispersions are quite different . we have substantiated these analytical results using many numerical plots for many different parameters at different conditions .",
    "we have also demonstrated the significance of magnetic field and control field in obtaining the large mor by isolating the effects of the two fields .",
    "finally we have discussed the possibility of large enhancement of mor for a broad range of probe frequencies - when probe and control fields are in two - photon resonance condition .",
