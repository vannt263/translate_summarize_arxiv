    "the prospect of manipulating the electron spin to store and transport information in semiconductor devices has led to renewed interest in the physics of transition metal ( tm ) impurities in semiconductors - an area which was intensively studied in the eighties @xcite .",
    "current interest @xcite in achievement of ferromagnetism ( fm ) at ambient temperatures has led to the investigation of the mechanism that stabilizes fm in transition - metal doped semiconductors .",
    "one useful approach to obtain an understanding of the electronic properties of these systems is the _ first principles electronic structure approach _ where one focuses on the explicit electronic and spin wavefunctions of the system .",
    "variational minimization of the total energy , determines within the underlying approximations of the spin density functional theory some of the basic features of the states involved , such as the extent of localization , the magnitude of the spin interactions as well as the identity of disorder and compensating defects ( antisites ; interstitials ) .",
    "however , the approach does have the drawback of underestimating the extent of electron correlations in addition to being a zero - temperature approach . while comparison with experiment ( _ e.g. _ ferromagnetic temperature vs. alloy composition @xcite ) can be used to assess the extent to which electron correlations are underestimated",
    ", the first - principle results have to be generally mapped onto a model hamiltonian to calculate finite temperature properties .",
    "while model hamiltonians @xcite have been widely used to describe the properties of these systems , the underlying assumptions in choosing a particular form for the hamiltonian are rarely justified in their own right .",
    "generally @xcite , one renormalizes away the electronic degree of freedom and retains only the spin degree of freedom for the transition metal impurity .",
    "one then assumes a local interaction between the transition metal impurity and the free carrier ( usually rkky - like ) , and then solves for various physical properties of these systems .    in the present work we use first - principles calculations to examine whether the assumptions made in model hamiltonian treatments are consistent with an _ ab - initio _ description of the electronic structure of these systems .",
    "our detailed results are then cast in the language of a simple electronic structure model , which could be used in an informed construction of model hamiltonians .",
    "we start by identifying the main physical quantities that come into play in determining the electronic structure of these systems .",
    "when a trivalent cation site such as ga of a iii - v semiconductor is replaced by divalent mn , an acceptor level ( denoted as e(0/- ) ) is generally created in the band gap . if the fermi level @xmath7 lies below this e(0/- )",
    "level , then mn is charge neutral , _",
    "i.e. _ , its formal oxidation + 3 equals that of the ga atom being replaced . in this case",
    "there is a hole in the mn - related orbital .",
    "if , on the other hand , the fermi level is above e(0/- ) , then the mn - related orbital captures an electron from the fermi sea ( _ i.e. _ creating a hole there ) , becoming negatively charged ( _ i.e. _ oxidation state mn@xmath8 ) . in this case",
    "the hole resides in the fermi sea . the mn - induced hole for @xmath9 e(0/- )",
    "features prominantly in contemporary theories of ferromagnetism    the model hamiltonians involve three entities - the host crystal states , the transition metal atom , and the impurity - induced hole state .",
    "there are approximations made at various levels which involve decoupling various degrees of freedom . at the first level , one decouples the orbital degrees of freedom associated with the transition metal atom , describing it with a localized spin - only part .",
    "the spin is interacting with a hole system through a local exchange interaction . at the next level of approximation ,",
    "one reduces the problem to that of the transition metal spin interacting with the hole spin , assuming that the host crystal is unperturbed .",
    "the main assumptions made in such approaches , which we wish to examine , are :    \\(i ) _ the hole resides in a bulk - like , hydrogenic , delocalized state .",
    "_ this picture is based on the assumption that the perturbing potential @xmath10-@xmath11 generated by the impurity is dominated by a long - ranged coulomb part , as a result of which only a small percentage of the charge resides in the wigner - seitz cell and the rest is distributed over a large portion of the host crystal . in this `` host - like hole '' picture ,",
    "one reduces the problem to a quasi - hydrogenic form in which the acceptor state is designated via quantum numbers ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ... ) of the host lattice . in such cases",
    "the wavefunction of the acceptor level is delocalized , and can essentially be constructed from the host crystal @xmath14 states .",
    "this picture is motivated by the fact that divalent , post transition metal atom elements such as zn@xmath8 form in iii - v semiconductors quasi - hydrogenic acceptor states @xcite with small binding energies .",
    "similarly , extrinsic @xmath13-type doping of ii - vi dilute magnetic semiconductor cdmnte @xcite also form hydrogenic hole states .",
    "however , unlike zn in gaas or extrinsic @xmath13-type cdmnte , the mn atom introduced into iii - v s has chemically active @xmath5 orbitals @xcite , so it is not obvious that the acceptor state it forms in gan , gap or gaas would qualify as a delocalized host - like hydrogenic state .",
    "indeed , the microscopic features determining the localization of the hole wavefunction , such as the @xmath5-character of the acceptor level must be considered .",
    "such interactions could change the symmetry ( @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 ) of the hole state , hence its coupling to the host .",
    "the pertinent quantum designation of the hole state is impurity - like ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) not host - like effective - mass @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ the host valence band maximum ( vbm ) levels are unperturbed by the transition metal impurity .",
    "_ in this view , the host band structure represented in the model hamiltonian could be described by a @xmath15.@xmath13 model , valid for the pure host crystal and is decoupled from the part of the hamiltonian involving the host + hole system . however , since one of the symmetry representations of the mn @xmath5 orbitals in tetrahedral sites ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) is the same as that of the zincblende vbm ( @xmath0 ) , such states could couple , hence become mutually perturbed .",
    "\\(iii ) _ the spin of the hole couples to the spin of the transition metal impurity via an interatomic local exchange interaction @xmath16 . _ as only the spin degree of freedom of the transition metal atom is considered , while the orbital degree of freedom is ignored , the free carriers feel the effective magnetic field produced by the transition metal impurity spin .",
    "this is modelled as a _ local _ exchange interaction , @xmath16 , between the transition metal impurity and the spin of the free carrier . hence",
    ", the magnitude of @xmath16 determines the energy scale of ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "areas visited by the free carrier are rendered ferromagnetic .",
    "however certain materials @xcite are found to show activated behavior in their transport implying no free charge carriers , yet they exhibit ferromagnetism .",
    "the current model which requires delocalized carriers can not explain ferromagnetism in such systems .    in what follows , we use first principles calculations to examine the validity of assumptions ( i)-(iii ) for 3@xmath5 impurities v , cr , mn , fe , co and ni in gaas , as well as for mn and cr in gan , gap and gasb .",
    "we then construct a qualitative model that explains our numerical results .",
    "we find that    \\(i ) the mn - induced hole could have significant 3@xmath5 character .",
    "the assumption of a `` delocalized hydrogenic hole '' is not supported by first - principle calculations .",
    "the depth of the acceptor level ( reflecting its localization ) and the coupling of the 3@xmath5 impurity orbitals to the hole change markedly with the host crystal in the series gan @xmath2 gap @xmath2 gaas @xmath2 gasb . the hole generated by introducing mn in gan",
    "is found to have significant 3@xmath5 character , while in gasb the hole is found to have primarily host character .",
    "further , the symmetry of the hole depends on the combination of the host crystal with the impurity atom .",
    "for example while in gaas : co the hole has dominantly @xmath0 character , the corresponding isoelectronic impurity znse : fe has a hole with @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "\\(ii ) the presence of the transition metal impurity perturbs the valence band of the host semiconductor .",
    "the extent of the perturbation depends on the relative position of the impurity generated levels ( referenced to the valence band maximum of the host ) which have the same symmetry as the valence band maximum . in gaas : v which has levels with @xmath1 symmetry in the bandgap , the perturbation is small , while for gaas : mn the perturbation is large .",
    "\\(iii ) the interaction between the spin of the tm atom and the spin of the host - like hole has a predominantly non - local part .",
    "this is evidenced by the strong stabilization of the ferromagnetic state for mn and cr pairs in gaas at @xmath17 8 @xmath18 separation .",
    "this interaction induces a spin - polarization of the host - like states .",
    "the direction of the spin - polarization depends on the relative energy position of the cation vacancy generated ( host - like ) states with respect to the impurity states .",
    "furthermore , the band - theoretic description of cr in gap shows a partially occupied mid - gap band , and the wavefunctions associated with this mid - gap state are localized . yet , even in the absence of free carriers , our total energy calculations predict a ferromagnetic ground state to be strongly stabilized , while no long range magnetic order is expected .",
    "there have been considerable earlier first - principles @xcite work on the electronic structure of these systems .",
    "one of the most well - studied systems is mn in gaas , which is found to be half - metallic @xcite .",
    "the gaas cell with one mn atom in it has a net magnetic moment of 4 @xmath19 @xcite , with part of the moment residing on the as neighbors of the mn atom .",
    "the hole state is found to be strongly hybridized with the transition metal state , and has been referred to as a hybridized band of holes @xcite .",
    "the mn atom and its four nearest neighbors are found to account for most of the density of states at the valence band edge @xcite . since only the first shell of as atoms surrounding mn are affected by the spin polarization of the mn atom , the interactions are believed to be short - ranged @xcite .",
    "the first principle results have been interpreted by ref .",
    "@xcite as suggestive of a @xmath6/@xmath20 electron configuration on mn @xcite .",
    "lda+u calculations @xcite have been used to obtain a description of the electronic structure consistent with photoemission .",
    "first - principle calculations have been used earlier to elucidate the magnetism in these systems .",
    "mahadevan and zunger @xcite developed a simple model of interaction of the cation - vacancy generated states with the transition metal states to understand how ferromagnetism results when mn is doped into the chalcopyrite semiconductor cdgep@xmath21 .",
    "sato and katayama - yoshida @xcite have calculated the energy difference between ferromagnetic and the random alloy to determine which impurity could give rise to ferromagnetism .",
    "they found that at low concentrations v , cr , and mn doping in iii - v stabilized the ferromagnetic state , while , fe , co and ni doping stabilized the magnetically disordered state .",
    "mirbt , sanyal and mohn @xcite showed that the interaction of the transition metal impurity with the as dangling bond states could result in a spin polarization of the hybridized dangling bond states .",
    "the partial occupancy of these spin - polarized levels results in ferromagnetism .",
    "sanvito , ordejon and hill @xcite found an decrease of the spin - splitting of the valence band maximum of the gaas host with impurity concentration .",
    "this is in contrast with what is expected from the mean - field kondo hamiltonian traditionally used to describe these systems @xcite .",
    "they attribute the deviation to a breakdown of the mean - field approximation , while they say that the kondo hamiltonian is good enough to provide a description of the ferromagnetism .",
    "schilfgaarde and mryasov @xcite have used the total energies obtained from first - principle calculations for different materials to extract exchange interaction strengths .",
    "they find a decrease of the exchange interactions with concentration which prompts them to suggest that the picture @xcite of carrier - mediated ferromagnetism is not valid for these systems .",
    "we build on the current understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties that exists in the literature .",
    "however , we focus our calculations specifically on the examination of the features ( i)-(iii ) assumed as `` input '' to most model hamiltonian theories .",
    "we have carried out first - principle electronic structure calculations using density functional theory , within the momentum space total energy pseudopotential method @xcite , using ultra - soft pseudopotentials @xcite as implemented in the vasp @xcite code .",
    "the ga pseudopotentials that we used for gaas and gap did not include the ga 3@xmath5 states in the valence .",
    "while this is usually a good approximation for gaas and gap , it has been found that for gan not retaining ga 3@xmath5 states in the valence leads to erroneous results for some physical properties such as optimized lattice constant , cohesive energy @xcite .",
    "we therefore used ultra - soft pseudopotentials which included ga @xmath5 states in the basis for gan .",
    "we studied transition metal impurities - v , cr , mn , fe , co and ni in 64 atom supercells of zincblende gasb , gaas , gap and gan . in table",
    "i we compare the calculated lattice constants of pure iii - v using pw91 gga exchange functional @xcite with the experimental values @xcite .",
    "we have fixed the equilibrium lattice constant of the supercells at the calculated values of the pure host given in table i. the basis sets had a cutoff energy for plane waves equal to 13.3  ry for gasb , gaas and gap and 29.4  ry for gan .",
    "we used a monkhorst pack grid of 4x4x4 k - points which includes @xmath14 .",
    "the cell - internal positions of the atoms were allowed to relax to minimize the forces .",
    "the equilibrium transition metal - to - as bond lengths in gaas were 2.47 , 2.47 , 2.48 , 2.44 , 2.36 and 2.34 @xmath18 for v , cr , mn , fe , co and ni respectively .",
    "the @xmath5 partial density of states as well as the local moment at the transition metal were calculated within a sphere of radius of 1.2 @xmath18 about the atoms and have been broadened with a gaussian of 0.2  ev full width at half maximum .",
    "the total energy differences between the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic spin arrangements were computed for tm pairs at first and fourth neighbor separations for a parallel and an anti - parallel arrangement of their spins to determine whether a specific transition metal impurity resulted in a ferromagnetic state or not .",
    "_ lda vs. gga : _ in order to compare lda @xcite and gga @xcite exchange functionals , we consider the case of co impurity in gaas , where earlier lda work @xcite suggests a nonmagnetic ground state . using the experimental lattice constant of 5.65 @xmath18 for gaas , we find that the gga calculations lead to a magnetic ground state with a moment of 2 @xmath19 .",
    "the energy of this state is strongly stabilized by @xmath17 150  mev compared to the nonmagnetic state .",
    "using lda exchange functional we find that while the nonmagnetic state is stabilized for a 2x2x2 monkhorst pack grid as used in the earlier work @xcite , the magnetic state with the moment of 2 @xmath19 is stabilized by @xmath17 40 mev for a 4x4x4 monkhorst pack k - points grid .",
    "these observations are consistent with the fact that gga calculations have a greater ability to stabilize a magnetic ground state than lda calculation . for other impurities - cr and mn in gaas ,",
    "the lda and gga results are found to give the same ground state .",
    "we use the gga exchange functional throughout this work .",
    "the introduction of various transition metal impurities lead to defect levels in the band gap of the semiconducting host .",

    "for a free atom one would expect levels of one spin channel to be filled up before levels of the other spin channel ; the deviation that one observes here reflects solid state effects .",
    "the two sets of @xmath40 and @xmath41 levels that we find for each impurity are suggestive of bonding / antibonding combinations arising from hybridization .",

    "the reason for the difference is that the stronger @xmath13-@xmath5 hybridization for gaas : co pushes the @xmath57 levels to higher energies , so that the @xmath68 levels are occupied first and the hole resides in the @xmath57 level .",

    "we have constructed a microscopic model which captures the basic aspects of the electronic structure of transition metal impurities in semiconductors .",
    "the elements of this model are the relative separation of the dangling bond and transition metal levels , the @xmath13-@xmath5 hybridization strength and the crystal - field and exchange splittings of the transition metal levels .",
    "we model a change in these interaction strengths by changing the semiconducting host , keeping the transition metal impurity fixed , - mn .",
    "we find that while the hole introduced by mn has significant 3@xmath5 character in gan , it is more delocalized in gaas . the symmetry ( @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 ) , the character ( dbh vs. cfr ) as well as the occupancy of the gap level , determine the magnetic ground state favored by the transition metal impurity .",

    "the basic picture that emerges from our first - principles calculations could be used to replace the more naive model - hamiltonian treatments which have assumed a host - like - hole picture , an unperturbed valence band and that the spin of the hole couples to the spin of the tm via a local exchange interaction ."

    "<S> we use first - principle calculations for transition metal impurities v , cr , mn , fe , co and ni in gaas as well as cr and mn in gan , gap and gasb to identify the basic features of the electronic structure of these systems . the microscopic details of the hole state such as the symmetry and the orbital character , as well as the nature of the coupling between the hole and the transition metal impurity are determined . this could help in the construction of model hamiltonians to obtain a description of various properties beyond what current first - principle methods are capable of . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the introduction of a transition metal impurity in iii - v semiconductor introduces a pair of levels with @xmath0 symmetry - one localized primarily on the transition metal atom referred to as crystal - field resonance ( cfr ) and the other localized primarily on the neighboring anions referred to as the dangling bond hybrid ( dbh ) . in addition , a set of nonbonding states with @xmath1 symmetry , localized on the transition metal atom are also introduced . </S>",
    "<S> each of the levels is also spin - split . </S>",
    "<S> considering mn in the host crystal series gan @xmath2 gap @xmath2 gaas @xmath2 gasb , we find that while in gan the hole resides in the @xmath3 level deep in the band gap , in gaas and gasb it resides in the @xmath4 level located just above the valence - band maximum . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a dbh - cfr level anticrossing exists along this host - crystal series . </S>",
    "<S> a similar anticrossing occurs for a fixed host crystal ( _ e.g. _ gaas ) and changing the 3@xmath5 impurity along the 3@xmath5 series : v in gaas represents a dbh - below - cfr limit , whereas mn corresponds to the dbh - above - cfr case . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the identity of the hole carrying orbital changes . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry ( @xmath1 vs. @xmath0 ) , the character ( dbh vs. cfr ) as well as the occupancy of the gap level , determine the magnetic ground state favored by the transition metal impurity . </S>",
    "<S> lda+u calculations are used to model the effect of lowering the energy of the mn @xmath6 state by varying u. we find that this makes the dbh state more host - like , and at the same time , diminishes ferromagnetism . while the spin - splitting of the host valence band in the presence of the impurity has been used to estimate the exchange coupling between the hole and the transition metal impurity , we show how using this would result in a gross underestimation of the coupling . </S>"
