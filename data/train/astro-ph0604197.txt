    "in the galactic plane scan performed by the hess cherenkov array in 2004 , with a flux sensitivity of @xmath4 crab units for @xmath0-rays above @xmath5 gev , eight sources were discovered @xcite .",
    "one of the newly detected @xmath0-ray sources is hess j1834 - 087 which is found to be , in projection , spatially coincident with snr g23.3 - 0.3 ( w41 ) .",
    "the possibility of a random correlation between the vhe source and snr g23.3 - 0.3 was estimated to be 6% for the central region of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the high energy source could also be connected to the old pulsar psrj1833 - 0827 ( gaensler & johnston 1995 ) , which would be energetic enough as to power hess j1834 - 087 . however",
    ", its location at 24 arc minutes away from the center of hess j1834 - 087 , renders an association unlikely @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is also no extended pwn detected so far , whereas hess j1834 - 087 has been found to be extended : a brightness distribution @xmath6 with a size @xmath7 has been reported by hess @xcite .    here",
    ", we present observations of hess j1834 - 087 with the major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov telescope ( magic ) .",
    "we briefly discuss the observational technique used and the procedure implemented for the data analysis , derive a very high energy @xmath0-ray spectrum of the source , and analyze it in comparison with other observations , including the molecular environment found in the region of w41 .",
    "magic ( see e.g. , @xcite for a detailed description ) is the largest single dish imaging air cherenkov telescope ( iact ) in operation .",
    "located on the canary island la palma ( @xmath8n , @xmath9w , 2200  m a.s.l . ) , the telescope has a 17-m diameter tessellated parabolic mirror , supported by a light weight space frame of carbon fiber reinforced plastic tubes .",
    "it is equipped with a 576-pixel @xmath10 field - of - view enhanced quantum efficiency photomultiplier ( pmt ) camera .",
    "the analogue pmt signals are transported via optical fibers to the trigger electronics and are read out by a 300 msamples / s fadc system . at la palma , hess j1834 - 087 culminates at about @xmath11 zenith angle ( za ) .",
    "this za increases the energy threshold for magic observations , but also , it provides a larger effective collection area .",
    "the sky region around the location of hess j1834 - 087 has a relatively high and non - uniform level of background light . within a distance of 1@xmath12 from hess j1834 - 087 ,",
    "there are 3 stars brighter than 8@xmath13 magnitude , with the star field being brighter in the region nw of the source .",
    "magic observations were carried out in the false - source tracking ( wobble ) mode @xcite .",
    "the sky directions ( w1 , w2 ) to be tracked are such that in the camera the sky brightness distribution relative to w1 is similar to the one relative to w2 .",
    "the source direction is in both cases @xmath14 offset from the camera center .",
    "these two tracking positions are shown by white stars in figure [ fig : disp_map ] .",
    "for each tracking position two background control regions are used , which are located symmetrically to the source region ( denoted by the central white circle ) with respect to the camera center . during wobble",
    "mode data taking , 50% of the data is taken at w1 and 50% at w2 , switching ( wobbling ) between the 2 directions every 30 minutes .",
    "this observation mode allowed a reliable background estimation least affected by the medium - scale za and the inhomogeneous star field .",
    "hess j1834 - 087 was observed for a total of 20 hours in the period august - september 2005 ( za @xmath15 ) . in total , about 12 million triggers have been recorded .",
    "the data analysis was carried out using the standard magic analysis and reconstruction software @xcite , the first step of which involves the calibration of the raw data @xcite .",
    "it follows the general steps presented in @xcite : after calibration , image cleaning tail cuts of 10 photoelectrons ( ph .  el . ) for image core pixels and 5 ph .",
    "( boundary pixels ) have been applied ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these tail cuts are accordingly scaled for the larger size of the outer pixels of the magic camera .",
    "the camera images are parameterized by image parameters @xcite . in this analysis , the random forest method",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed description ) was applied for the @xmath0/hadron separation ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) and the energy estimation .",
    "for the training of the random forest a sample of monte carlo ( mc ) generated @xmath0-showers @xcite was used together with about 1% randomly selected events from the measured wobble data .",
    "the mc @xmath0-showers were generated between 35@xmath16 and 45@xmath16 za with energies between 10  gev and 30  tev with a size distribution equal to the one of the selected data events for the training .",
    "the source - position independent image parameters size , width , length , conc @xcite and the third moment of the ph .",
    "distribution along the major image axis were selected to parameterize the shower images .",
    "after the training , the random forest method allows to calculate for every event a parameter , so - called hadronness , which is a measure of the probability that the event is not @xmath0-like .",
    "the @xmath0-sample is defined by selecting showers with a hadronness below a specified value . an independent sample of mc @xmath0-showers was used to determine the cut efficiency .",
    "the analysis at similar za angles was developed and verified using crab nebula data taken in september 2005 , see also @xcite .",
    "the crab energy spectrum , as determined by our studies , was consistent with measurements from other experiments ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , dot - dashed line ) .    for each event",
    "the arrival direction of the primary @xmath0-ray candidate in sky coordinates is estimated using the disp - method @xcite .",
    "a conservative lower size cut of 200 ph .",
    "el . is applied to select a subset of events with superior angular resolution .",
    "the corresponding analysis energy threshold is about 250  gev",
    ".    figure [ fig : disp_map ] shows the sky map of @xmath0-ray candidates ( background subtracted , see e.g. @xcite ) from the direction of hess j1834 - 087 . it is folded with a two - dimensional gaussian with a standard deviation of @xmath17 and a maximum of one .",
    "the magic @xmath0-ray psf ( standard deviation of a two dimensional gaussian fit to the non - folded brightness profile of a point source ) is @xmath18 .",
    "the folding of the sky map serves to increase the signal - to - noise ratio by smoothing out statistical fluctuations .",
    "however , it somewhat degrades the spatial resolution .",
    "the sky map is overlayed with contours of 90 cm vla radio data ( green ) from @xcite ( 20 cm radio data from the same reference are overlayed in the following figures ) and @xmath3co emission contours from @xcite ( black ) , integrated in the velocity range 70 to 85 km / s , the range that best defines the molecular cloud associated with w41 .",
    "the magic excess is centered at ( ra , dec)=(18@xmath1934@xmath2027@xmath21 , -8@xmath164240  ) .",
    "the statistical error is 0.5 , the systematic pointing uncertainty is estimated to be 2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a fit of a two dimensional gaussian brightness profile to the non - folded sky map yields after subtraction the magic @xmath0-ray psf inquadrature an intrinsic source extension of @xmath22 ( the extension reported by hess is @xmath23 @xcite ) . both , position and extension , coincide well with the shell - type snr g23.3 - 0.3 ( w41 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : theta2 ] shows the distribution of the squared angular distance , @xmath24 , between the reconstructed shower direction and the excess center .",
    "the observed excess in the direction of hess j1834 - 087 has a significance of 8.6@xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "figure [ fig : three_disp_maps ] shows images of hess j1834 - 087 with three different lower cuts on size ( 200 , 300 , 600 ph.el ) , corresponding to energy thresholds of about 250 , 360 and 590 gev . as in figure [ fig : disp_map ] the background subtracted sky maps are folded with a two - dimensional gaussian , but here the color scale shows directly the excess significance .",
    "the total observed excess significance for @xmath26 ( corresponding to the sky region inside the central white circle of figure [ fig : disp_map ] ) are 8.6@xmath25 , 7.8@xmath25 and 7.3@xmath25 for the three lower cuts on size .",
    "overlayed are contours of 20 cm vla radio data from @xcite ( green ) and @xmath2co emission contours ( black ) from @xcite .",
    "the contours of the radio emission are at 0.0035 jy / beam .",
    "the @xmath2co contours are integrated from 70 to 85 km / s in velocity , as was the @xmath3co data in figure [ fig : disp_map ] .",
    "for all three size cuts the magic psf is about @xmath27 , and the source position , extension and morphology stay roughly constant .",
    "the characteristics of the magic observation are compatible within errors with the measurement of hess @xcite .    for the spectral analysis a sky region of maximum angular distance of @xmath28 around the excess center",
    "( indicated by the white circle in figure [ fig : disp_map ] ) has been integrated .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum ] shows the reconstructed very high energy @xmath0-ray spectrum ( @xmath29 vs. true @xmath30 ) of hess j1834 - 087 after correcting ( unfolding ) for the instrumental energy resolution @xcite .",
    "the horizontal bars indicate the bin size in energy , the marker is placed in the bin center on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the full line shows the result of a forward unfolding procedure : a simple power law spectrum is fitted to the measured spectrum ( @xmath29 vs. estimated @xmath30 ) taking the full instrumental energy migration ( true @xmath30 vs. estimated @xmath30 ) into account as described in @xcite .",
    "the result is given by ( @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 the quoted errors are statistical .",
    "the systematic error is estimated to be 35% in the flux level determination and 0.2 in the spectral index , see also @xcite .",
    "within the observation time ( weeks ) no flux variations exceeding the measurement errors have been observed .",
    "also , the flux is compatible within errors with the measurement of hess made one year earlier .",
    "snrs as gamma - ray sources have been extensively discussed in the past ( e.g. , see torres et al .",
    "2003 for a review ) . due to the spatial coincidence between the vhe @xmath0-ray source and the snr g23.3 - 0.3 ( w41 )",
    ", this snr appears to be the natural candidate for generating the observed @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "w41 is an asymmetric shell - type snr , with a diameter of 27 arc minutes .",
    "it is included in green s catalog @xcite , and has a spectral index of 0.5 , and a flux density of 70 jy at 1 ghz .",
    "it was mapped in radio with the vla array at 330 mhz ( kassim 1992 ) and at 20 and 90 cm ( see white , becker & helfand 2005 ) , following earlier studies ( see , e.g. , ariskin & berulis 1970 , shaver & goss 1970 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is partially overlapping with snr g22.7 - 0.2 ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "9 of kassim 1992 ) , although the latter is not in coincidence with the peak of the very high energy source ( see figure 1 above ) .",
    "no chandra and xmm observations of w41 are publicly available yet .",
    "w41 was associated with a very large molecular complex called `` [ 23,78 ] '' in dame et al .",
    "there , it was concluded that there are probably two large clouds blended at that position in @xmath33 space , one in the near side of the 4 kpc arm and another in the far side of the scutum arm .",
    "the giant molecular cloud associated with w41 is best defined by integrating the co emission from 70 to 85 km / s in velocity .",
    "the co emission peaks near l=@xmath34 , b=@xmath35 , v=78 km / s ; the near kinematic distance of this peak is 4.9 kpc .",
    "the peak is marked by the central black contour in figure 1 , which lies very close to the vhe source .",
    "the total h@xmath36 mass of the cloud , computed over the range l=@xmath37 to @xmath38 , b=@xmath39 to @xmath40 , and v=70 to 85 km / s , and assuming a distance of 4.9 kpc , is @xmath41 m@xmath42 .",
    "this mass is necessarily an upper limit since , as mentioned above , there is certainly an emission contribution from unrelated gas at the far kinematic distance .",
    "still , the co peak is so strong and well defined that it most likely arises from gas primarily at one location , near the vhe source , rather than being a random blend of emissions from the near and far distances .",
    "the total h@xmath43 mass of the co emission peak in figure 1 ( computed over the region l=@xmath44 to @xmath45 , b=@xmath46 to @xmath47 , v=70 to 85 km / s ) is @xmath48 m@xmath42 .",
    "the higher - resolution @xmath2co map in figure 3 , which was derived from the recently completed galactic ring survey ( jackson et al . 2006 ) , confirms that the vhe source lies toward the a local enhancement of molecular material , a giant molecular cloud .    at 5 kpc , the luminosity of hess j1834 - 087 between 250 gev and a few tev is about @xmath49 erg s@xmath50 , similar to the luminosity of hess j1813 - 178 @xcite if that source is considered associated with snr g12.8 - 0.0 at a distance of @xmath51 kpc .",
    "we note , though , that j1813 - 178 has been found to be nearly point like whereas in the present case , a significant extension is observed .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectrum of hess j1834 - 087 is steeper than the one of j1813 - 178 . from the observed @xmath0-ray luminosity , and assuming an acceleration efficiency of hadrons in the order of 3% and a supernova power of 10@xmath52 erg , the required density of matter in the @xmath0-ray production region for hadrons to be mainly responsible of the observed radiation can be estimated from the formula @xmath53 , and it is of about @xmath54 11 @xmath55 ( see torres et al . 2003 and references therein ) . with the extension of hess j1834 - 087 , and",
    "the gas mass found to be in the innermost contour of the co map , i.e. , in close superposition with the very high energy source , there is enough mass to generate the high energy radiation hadronically , even if only part of the gas is interacting with the snr shock .",
    "all in all , the observation of hess j1834 - 087 using the magic telescope confirms a new very high - energy extended @xmath0-ray source in the galactic plane .",
    "a reasonably large data set was collected from observations at medium - scale zenith angles to infer the spectrum of this source up to energies of a few tev . above 200 gev",
    ", the differential energy spectrum can be fitted with a power law of slope @xmath56 .",
    "the results of the independent observations of the hess and magic telescopes are in agreement within errors concerning the level of flux , the spectral shape , the morphology , and the extension of the source .",
    "the coincidence of the vhe @xmath0-ray source with snr g23.3 - 0.3 ( w41 ) poses this snr as a natural counterpart , and although the mechanism responsible for the high energy radiation remains yet to be clarified , a massive molecular cloud has been identified in the region .",
