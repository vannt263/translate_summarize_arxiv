    "the r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are a small group of hydrogen - deficient carbon - rich supergiants which undergo spectacular declines in brightness at apparently irregular intervals tied to their pulsation cycles ( clayton 1996 ) . a cloud of carbon - rich dust forms along the line of sight , eclipsing the photosphere .",

    "v854  cen exhibits smoothly - extended emission , limb - darkened rather than brightened , reaching out to about @xmath125 .",
    "no comparable diffuse extended feature is apparent around ry  sgr .",
    "however , as shown in the lower panels , both stars display broader spatial profiles in the near - star region than the continuum trace ; and indeed the v854  cen inner profile is offset from the stellar continuum `` core '' by about 10  milliarcseconds ( 25  au at the distance of the star ) .",
    "the continuum spatial profiles of each star are the thicker solid curves in the lower panels .",
    "the shaded profile represents a @xmath01520 continuum trace @xmath11@xmath18 based on an average of g140l 52@xmath1005 observations of several unresolved white dwarf ( wd ) stars ( obtained from the _ hst _ archive ) ; the dot - dashed curve is the @xmath01335 trace from the same observations ( without errors , which are of similar magnitude to the @xmath01520 example ) .",
    "the @xmath01335 wd profile is slightly wider than the longer wavelength trace at a level that is significant with respect to the standard error of the mean , but which hardly would be noticeable in the comparisons , for example , in the upper panels .",
    "( in the near - star examples , a background was determined in the zone @xmath1(0525 ) , so that the influence of the extended emission of v854  cen would be suppressed , and all the stars  including the comparison wds  would be treated on the same basis . )",
    "the surface intensity of the extended emission of v854  cen has an average value of @xmath19  ergs @xmath8 s@xmath5 ( @xmath20)@xmath21 , having compensated for @xmath229 of absorption at 1335    [ assuming @xmath131 ] .",
    "the appearance of the emission suggests that it comes from a filled volume or thick shell ; rather than a thin shell , which would be strongly limb - brightened . for the sake of argument",
    ", we assume that the extended emission represents material ejected in a steady wind , with an @xmath23 density fall - off .",
    "the relatively mild decline of the observed surface intensity away from the star suggests that the inner part of the volume ",
    "perhaps 50% in radius  is evacuated , otherwise the flux would fall off much more rapidly .",
    "although we have only a 05 wide cut across the structure , we will assume that it is a uniform disk on the sky of radius 25 .",
    "integrating the specific intensity over that area yields a total dereddened emission of @xmath24  ergs @xmath8 s@xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath25  ergs s@xmath5 ( @xmath26 ) at the @xmath32.5  kpc distance of v854  cen .",
    "since the extended emission has a significantly larger total flux than the point source , and would fall entirely within the _ iue _ 10@xmath1020 large aperture , the spatially integrated emission ( @xmath27  ergs @xmath8 s@xmath5 before the reddening correction ) is what should be compared to the _ iue _ measures given previously , thereby accounting for the apparent discrepancy mentioned above .",
    "there are two general possibilities to explain the extended emission : ( 1 ) collisional excitation in a warm ( @xmath28  k ) , perhaps shock - heated , gas ; or ( 2 ) resonance scattering of the intrinsic stellar emission feature in an optically thick evelope . in the latter case ,",
    "the gas could be collisionally ionized ( and therefore warm ) , or photoionized ( and thus potentially much cooler ) . since atomic carbon can be photoionized out of the low - lying metastable 2p@xmath29@xmath30d state ( 1  ev above ground ; edge at 1239   ) by ly@xmath31 , and",
    "since v854  cen has considerably more hydrogen than typical rcb s , the latter case is a very real possibility .      in the collisionally excited warm plasma case",
    ", we can infer the emission measure ( @xmath32 ) from the apparent flux of radiation .",
    "the emissivity of at @xmath33  k is @xmath34  ergs @xmath35 s@xmath5 ( cf . ,",
    "kaastra , mewe , & nieuwenhuijzen [ 1996 ] ; for a solar carbon to hydrogen ratio of @xmath36 ) .",
    "we infer @xmath37  @xmath38 ( assuming that all of the electrons come from carbon , and that all of the carbon is singly ionized , i.e. , @xmath39 ) . the radius of the region is 25 , or @xmath40  au ( 0.03  pc ) at the distance of v854  cen .",
    "given the thick - shell geometry described previously , and the assumption of an @xmath23 outward decline in density , one can relate the average carbon density @xmath41 ( which equals the electron density ) , and the total carbon number @xmath42 , to the emission measure .",
    "we find @xmath431.2  @xmath38 ( which corresponds to an average particle density of @xmath317  @xmath38 for h / c= 2 and he / c= 10 ) , and @xmath44 .",
    "the mean mass per carbon atom , with the abundances given above , is @xmath45  g ; so the total mass of material in the shell is about @xmath46  g , or @xmath47  @xmath48 . to fill such a shell",
    "would require a wind of 200  km  s@xmath5 ( such as is seen in the gas associated with dust formation in rcb stars ) acting for a period of about 75  yr ( to achieve the proposed @xmath49  au thickness of the structure ) ; the steady mass loss rate would have to be of order @xmath50  yr@xmath5 .",
    "the lifetime of the rcb evolutionary phase is uncertain , but r  crb , itself , has been an rcb star for at least 200  yr ( clayton 1996 ) . if the gas is cooler than the temperature of maximum emissivity , the inferred densities could increase substantially .",
    "a difficulty with the collisional excitation model  which leads directly into consideration of the scattering case  is that the predicted column density of is substantial , and resonance absorption of the intrinsic stellar emission feature should be severe ( line center optical depths of @xmath51 , or so ) ; unless the majority of the envelope material is strongly blueshifted ( by more than the 200 km  s@xmath5 line width , if is a member of the broad - line class ) and the internal velocity dispersion is low ( @xmath52  km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "that would require the envelope material to be suddenly accelerated to its terminal velocity , which seems unlikely .      in the scattering case",
    ", we imagine that atomic carbon gas streaming away from the star , perhaps dragged along with radiatively accelerated dust grains , becomes photoionized by a flux of ly@xmath31 radiation from the star ( produced by the same `` chromospheric '' processes that account for the intrinsic emission ) , creating a c@xmath53 stromgren sphere .",
    "the c@xmath53 ions , in turn , could resonantly absorb the @xmath01335 multiplet emission from the star ; strongly attenuating the stellar emission and redistributing it throughout the stromgren sphere by multiple scatterings",
    ". the process would be nearly conservative because the envelope density is so low that collisional deactivations would be negligible .",
    "since the extended @xmath01335 emission of v854  cen appears to be about 7@xmath10 the flux of the stellar point source , we infer that the average optical depth across the stellar features must be @xmath32 .",
    "if we imagine that the flow smoothly accelerates away from the star up to a terminal velocity of 200  km s@xmath5 , such that each velocity bin has equal column density , the optical depth at each point across the stellar emission feature will be @xmath54 , where the line oscillator strength @xmath55 is 0.1 for the two strong transitions of the multiplet , the line center wavelength @xmath56 is in  , the flow terminal velocity @xmath57 is in km  s@xmath5 , and @xmath58 is the column density of c@xmath53 ions in the ground state ( @xmath8 ) . for the indicated @xmath59 , one infers a column density of about @xmath60 @xmath8 .",
    "if the shell thickness is @xmath61 au , then the average c@xmath53 density would be about 0.02  @xmath38 , considerably smaller than we found for the collisionally excited case ( @xmath62  @xmath38 ) .",
    "the mass - loss requirements for filling the volume would be reduced dramatically as well .",
    "the one caveat is that since the ly@xmath31 photoionization of carbon occurs from an excited state , the local population of susceptible atoms depends very sensitively on the temperature ( unlike a normal region where the photoionization is from the ground state , and locally virtually every h atom can be ionized , if sufficient hard photons are present ) . in a partially ionized carbon envelope",
    ", the local density could be significantly higher than indicated by the resonance absorption .",
    "we do see strong @xmath01560 and @xmath01657 resonance absorptions in the point source spectrum of v854  cen , but the extent to which these are intrinsic to the stellar photosphere or contributed by the shell can not be established with these low - resolution traces . there do not appear to be any sensible extended emission zones at those wavelengths in the spectral image , however , suggesting that the carbon probably is mostly ionized in the 25 shell ; but the faintness of an extended region might simply be due to strong photospheric absorption that suppresses the photon flux available to excite the neutral gas .    undoubtedly , one of the key differences between v854  cen and ry  sgr , as far as revealing an extended carbon envelope , is the large hydrogen abundance of the former : the associated strong ly@xmath31 emission might be instrumental in ionizing the envelope so that it would be susceptible to illumination by the stellar emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that both stars apparently possess inner emission zones might indicate that the near - star regions are collisionally ionized and excited , rather than photo - dominated .",
    "many of these issues could be addressed more definitively with higher spectral resolution measurements , which , for example , could disentangle doppler shifted shell absorptions , if present , from the intrinsic stellar emission features .      we can obtain estimates for the inner emission zone of v854  cen .",
    "we fitted a simple model to the apparent cross - dispersion profile of the feature , using the @xmath01520 continuum profile as an estimate of the line spread function at 1335   .",
    "the model consisted of a point source , and two uniform surface brightness disks , one 01 in radius , the other 03 .",
    "the best fit was achieved by shifting the point source by 001 relative to the continuum `` core , '' the smaller disk by 002 in the same direction , and the larger disk by 002 in the opposite direction .",
    "the relative fluxes were in the ratio 1.0:1.0:0.75 .",
    "the innermost disk has a surface brightness about 40  times that of the 25 extended diffuse component .    at the distance of v854",
    "cen , the inner 01 disk has a radius of about 250  au , and the average excess flux , corrected for reddening , is @xmath63  ergs @xmath8 s@xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity is @xmath64  ergs s@xmath5 , and the carbon emission measure is @xmath65  @xmath38 ( again assuming the collisional excitation model in which carbon is the major electron donor , and is mostly singly ionized ) .",
    "unfortunately , converting the emission measure into an average carbon density is more difficult in this situation , because the inner radius of the zone could be quite small ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) : for a mass - conservative @xmath23 density law ( for a constant velocity outflow ) , the average density scales as @xmath67 , if the inner radius @xmath68 is much smaller than the maximum radial extent of the zone .",
    "we can , however , set an upper limit to the average density by assuming that the region is spherical with uniform density . in that case , @xmath4317  @xmath38 ( yielding an average particle density of @xmath3240  @xmath38 for h / c= 2 and he / c= 10 ) . the total mass of material in the volume would be about @xmath69  g , or @xmath70",
    "@xmath48 , where again this would be an upper limit .",
    "the crossing time for a 200  km  s@xmath5 wind would be about 7 yr , so the upper limit to the steady mass loss rate would be @xmath71  y@xmath5 , significantly smaller than the mass flux required to fill the outer shell .    similar intensity and emission measure estimates would apply to the inner emission zone of ry  sgr ( which could be fitted adequately using only the point source plus a 01 radius inner disk ) .",
    "however , the he / c abundance ratio could be as much as @xmath72 that of v854  cen , leading to a corresponding order of magnitude increase in the total particle density and mass of the emitting material .",
    "the bl lines such as and require relatively modest energies ( @xmath73 ev ) for ionization and excitation .",
    "but , other features such as @xmath74 , ] @xmath75 and @xmath010830 require significantly higher energies .",
    "the ionization potentials are 11 and 24  ev , respectively , to c@xmath53 and c@xmath76 . the lower level of the @xmath010830 transition is 20  ev above ground .",
    "it is metastable and could be populated from below by collisions or from above by cascades following recombination from ( geballe et al .",
    "since the rcb stars discussed here have only modest photospheric temperatures , @xmath777000  k , they can not produce through photoionization . at the same time",
    ", it is likely that there are enough uv photons to singly ionize carbon ( rao & lambert 1993 ) , particularly from its low - lying 2p@xmath29@xmath30d and 2p@xmath29@xmath30s states ( with edges at 1239    and 1444   , respectively ) .",
    "rao et al .  ( 1999 ) suggested that the high - excitation lines arise in an accretion disk around a white dwarf secondary . in that model , the formation zone for the hot - broad lines would be relatively small ( @xmath78  au ) assuming @xmath79  @xmath38 , and offset a few au from the primary .",
    "the apparent displacement of the emitting region by 001 or 25 au , seen in v854 cen , fits that model in a qualitative way .",
    "however , the fact that the majority of the @xmath01335 emission of v854  cen arises in an outer diffuse zone thousands of au from the star renders the wd model less appealing .",
    "collisional excitation in the extended thick shell perhaps is more plausible .",
    "high velocities ( up to @xmath3400  km  s@xmath5 ) are seen in absorption and emission lines during declines , probably originating from gas dragged along with the dust blown away from the star by radiation pressure ( rao & lambert 1993 ; feast 1996 , 2001 ; clayton 1996 ) .",
    "rao & lambert ( 1993 ) suggest that v854 cen may have a high velocity bipolar outflow . in these fast - moving clouds",
    ", excitation might take place through atomic collisions or shocks ( feast 2001 ) .",
    "an additional curiosity of the bl region are the so - called `` decline eclipses . ''",
    "the bl lines often are constant throughout declines , but sometimes are seen to fade significantly over @xmath3100 days indicating that a portion of the bl emission is coming from within a few au of the star ( herbig 1949 ; clayton et al .",
    "1992a ; lawson et al .",
    "the extended emission regions reported here bear some resemblance to the bl region deduced for v854  cen by rao & lambert ( 1993 ) using forbidden lines . assuming a homogeneous spherical nebula with @xmath80 = @xmath81 = 50  @xmath38 they infer r@xmath82 930  au for v854  cen at a distance of 2.5  kpc",
    ". if the filling factor is @xmath83 , then r@xmath82 @xmath84  au . our results are complementary in the sense that while we have the advantage of directly measuring the apparent size of the emission region(s ) on the sky , we lack a diagnostic to establish the mean density , and thus the filling factor if the material is highly clumped .",
    "unfortunately , a similar comparison can not be applied to ry  sgr , because the same range of decline spectra do not exist .",
    "although , it is difficult to make definitive statements regarding the absence of an extended emission region around ry  sgr , we point out the following : on the one hand , ry  sgr is believed to be less distant than v854  cen so a similar emission region would appear to be even more extended .",
    "such an envelope around ry  sgr , with the same mass content as that of v854  cen , would have as little as one tenth the carbon ( owing to the larger he / c ratio ) , and thus only _",
    "one hundredth _ the potential emission measure ( if carbon is the major electron donor ) .",
    "alternatively , the envelope of v854  cen might be ionized into visibility by a significant ly@xmath31 emission flux , whereas the resonance emission of ry  sgr would be much less prominent , owing to the severely reduced hydrogen abundance .",
    "on the other hand , perhaps an extended low density bl region simply is not present around ry  sgr .",
    "v854  cen arguably is significantly different from ry  sgr  and the majority of rcb stars  in its hydrogen and other element abundances , its high level of decline activity , and its emission line spectrum ( clayton 1996 , asplund et al .",
    "so , perhaps it would not be surprising if it differs in this manner as well .",
    "the behavior of the v854  cen lightcurve over the last century provides some support for the finding in  4.1 that the 25 shell likely is filled in the outer 50% and of lower density in the inner part .",
    "although v854  cen is one of the most active rcb stars today , it had an even higher mass loss rate in the period of 19131952 when it was generally fainter than 13th magnitude ( clayton 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the shell could be filled by gas traveling at 200 km  s@xmath5 in @xmath375 yr , which matches well with the observed timescales of the decline activity in v854  cen .",
    "approximately 50  yr of high activity followed by 50  yr of lesser activity could result in a relatively greater density in the outer part of the shell .",
    "other than v854  cen , the only resolved rcb spatial structures are the large iras shell of r  crb ( gillett et al .",
    "1986 ) , and a tenuous @xmath37  radius envelope around uw  cen seen in dust - reflected visible light ( pollacco et al .",
    "1991 ; clayton et al .",
    "at the assumed  but very uncertain  distance of uw  cen , the radius would be @xmath30.2  pc ( 4@xmath85 au ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the uw  cen nebula is a fossil planetary nebula shell created by a slow - moving outflow from the star over thousands of years ( clayton et al .",
    "but , in analogy with v854  cen , such a shell also might be produced by high velocity ejections during the present rcb - star epoch .",
    "this work was supported by stsci grant go-07477.01 - 96a and nasa grant nag5 - 3226 ( tra ) .",
    "we thank denise taylor , steve hulbert and brian espey for their help in obtaining and reducing the data reported in this paper ."

    "<S> we have obtained long - slit far - ultraviolet ( 11501730   ) spectra of the r  coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars v854  cen and ry  sgr , near maximum light and pulsational phase zero , with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the far - uv spectrum of each star shows a photospheric continuum rising steeply toward longer wavelengths , and a prominent emission feature at @xmath01335 . ry  sgr displays a second , but fainter , emission attributed to @xmath01351 ( which is radiatively fluoresced by @xmath01335 ) , but is weak or absent in v854  cen . </S>",
    "<S> most surprisingly , the emission of v854  cen is significantly extended along the slit by @xmath12.5 , about @xmath2  au at the distance of the star . </S>",
    "<S> the feature of ry  sgr exhibits no such gross extension . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , subtle broadenings of the emissions beyond the point response profile suggests inner clouds of radius @xmath301 ( 250  au ) around both stars . </S>",
    "<S> v854 cen is only the third rcb star after r crb and uw cen known to have a resolved shell . </S>"
