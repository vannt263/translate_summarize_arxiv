    "emergent properties of artificial or natural complex systems attract growing interests recently .",
    "some of them are conveniently modeled with a network , where constituting ingredients and interactions are represented with vertices and links , respectively .",
    "watts and strogatz demonstrated that real - world networks display the small - world effect and the clustering property , which can not be explained with the regular and random networks  @xcite . later on , in the study of the www network , albert _ et al . _ found that the degree , the number of attached links , of each vertex follows a power - law distribution  @xcite .",
    "those works trigger a burst of researches on the structure and the organization principle of complex networks  ( see refs.@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "many real - world networks , e.g. , in biological , social , and technological systems , are found to obey the power - law degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "a network with the power - law distribution is called a scale - free  ( sf ) network .",
    "one of the possible mechanism for the power law is successfully explained with the barabsi - albert  ( ba ) model  @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that a network is growing and that the rate acquiring a new link for an existing vertex is proportional to a popularity measured by its degree .",
    "the popularity - based growth appears very natural since , e.g. , creating a new web site , one would link it preferentially to popular sites having many links . with the ba and related network models ,",
    "structural and dynamical properties of networks have been explored extensively .",
    "on the other hand , there exists another class of networks which have a group structure .",
    "consider , for example , online communities such as the `` groups '' operated by the yahoo  ( http://www.yahoo.com ) and the `` cafes '' operated by the korean portal site daum  ( http://www.daum.net ) .",
    "they consist of individual members and groups , gatherings of members with a common interest , and growth of the community is driven not only by members but also by groups .",
    "a community evolves as an individual registers as a new member .",
    "the new comers can create new groups with existing members or joins existing groups .",
    "the online community is a rapidly growing social network  @xcite .",
    "the emerging structure would be distinct from that observed in networks without the group structure . in this paper , we propose a growing network model for the community with the group structure .",
    "we model the community with a bipartite network consisting of two distinct kinds of vertices representing members and groups , respectively .",
    "a link may exist only between a member vertex and a group vertex , which represents a membership relation .",
    "the bipartite network  @xcite has been considered in the study of the movie actor network  @xcite consisting of actors and movies , the scientific collaboration network  @xcite of scientists and articles , and the company director network  @xcite of directors and boards of directors .",
    "usually those networks are treated as unipartite by projecting out one kind of vertices of less interest  @xcite .",
    "some biological and social networks are known to have a modular structure  @xcite , where vertices in a common module are densely connected while vertices in different modules are sparsely connected .",
    "the modular structure is coded implicitly in the connectivity between vertices .",
    "unipartite network models with the modular structure were also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where vertices form modules which in turn form bigger modules hierarchically  @xcite or the modular structure emerges dynamically as a result of social interactions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , each vertex is assigned to a potts - spin - like variable pointing to its module  @xcite .",
    "these studies on the group structures of networks have mainly focused on the groups with finite number of members . however , there are groups in the real - world online community which keep growing as the community evolves .    reflecting growing dynamics of the real - world online community",
    ", our model takes account of the group structure explicitly with a bipartite network consisting of member and group vertices . upon growing ,",
    "both the member and group vertices evolve in time .",
    "we study the dynamics of the size of groups and the activity of the members .",
    "the size of a group is defined as the number of members in the group and the activity of a member is the number of groups in which the member participates .",
    "when the community grows large enough , the group size distribution shows a power law distribution unlike the network models studied previously  @xcite . to test our model",
    ", we analyze the empirical data from on the online communities , the `` groups '' in http://www.yahoo.com and the `` cafe '' in http://www.daum.net and show that both communities indeed show power law group size distributions for wide ranges of group sizes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce the growing network model . depending on the choice of detailed dynamic rules , one may consider a few variants of the model .",
    "characteristics such as the group size distribution , the member activity distribution , and the growth of the number of groups are studied analytically in a mean field theory and numerically in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "those characteristics are also calculated for the real - world online communities and compared with the model results .",
    "we conclude the paper with summary in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "we introduce a model for a growing community with the group structure .",
    "the community grows by adding a new member at a time , who may open a new group or join an existing group  @xcite .",

    "the activity , the number of participating groups , of @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath2 . as members enter the community , new groups are created or existing groups expand .",

    ", the community is assumed to be inaugurated by @xmath10 members , denoted by @xmath11 , belonging to an initial group @xmath12 .",
    "that is , we have that @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . at time @xmath19 , a new individual @xmath20 is introduced into the community and becomes a member by repeating the following procedures until its activity reaches @xmath21 :    * * selection * : it selects a partner @xmath22 among existing members @xmath23 with a selection probability @xmath24 . * *",

    "in that case the creation probability is variable as @xmath32 . in the other case",
    ", it may create a new group with a fixed probability @xmath33 . combining the strategies in the two procedures , we consider the possible four different growth models denoted by rv , rf , pv , and pf , respectively .",
