    "this scenario supposes the gravitational collapse of a primordial gas cloud forming a supermassive star with a mass of @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , the formation process proceeds in a two - step manner ; a very small ( @xmath9 ) protostar first forms at the densest part of the cloud , and then grows in mass by rapid accretion from the surrounding envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "since such a fluffy protostar has low effective temperature and hence very low uv luminosity , the radiative feedback does not disturb the accretion flow at least until the stellar mass exceeds @xmath14 as long as continuous and efficient gas accretion ensues . in this _ letter _ , we extend our stellar evolution calculations until the smss begin to collapse .",
    "our calculations determine the final mass of the accreting smss by incorporating the realistic conditions within the context of the direct collapse scenario .",

    "we show that gas accretion significantly alters the stellar structure . with a very large accretion rate",

    "we adopt a primordial abundance pattern for an initial model with hydrogen and helium mass fractions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the same nuclear reaction networks as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a major difference of the code from that of @xcite is that no entropy generated at the accretion shock is assumed to be incorporated into the stellar interior .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath20 models in @xcite , where @xmath21 is the fraction of the accretion energy deposited in the stellar interior .",
    "however , varying this setting only affects the early evolution for the total stellar mass @xmath22 .",
    "we follow the evolution of an accreting protostar with four different rates of @xmath23 = 0.1 , 0.3 , 1 , and @xmath4 , starting with a @xmath24 initial model which has an inflated structure .",
    "we first checked that our calculations well reproduce the previous results by @xcite , who study the evolution before the gr effect becomes important .",

    "[ fig : f1 ] , the stellar core contracts monotonically over the kelvin - helmholtz timescales until the hydrogen burning via the cno cycle starts to sustain the star .",
    "although the evolutions from a to b are almost identical with different @xmath23 values in figure  [ fig : f1 ] , figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows that the stellar mass at point b is larger for higher @xmath23 .",
    "as shown in these figures , the central temperature at point b , i.e. , when the hydrogen burning begins , is @xmath28 with only very weak dependence on @xmath23 . during the hydrogen burning , i.e. , from b to c in figure  [ fig :",
    "f1 ] , the central temperature remains almost constant while the density decreases by more than a factor of 10 .",
    "this is because the central entropy is in general higher for more massive stars , and thus an accreting star evolves toward higher entropy ( lower density ) regions as its mass increases .",
    "after either the exhaustion of nuclear fuel at the center ( for the cases with 0.1 @xmath29 ) or the onset of the gr instability ( for 1 and 10 @xmath29 ) , the stellar core contracts again toward d. figure  [ fig : f2 ] shows that this occurs at higher stellar mass for higher accretion rate . in all the models ,",
    "the stars eventually enter the electron - positron pair - unstable region .",
    "it is known that stars with @xmath30 collapse directly to form bhs without explosion once entering this region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we show the hydrogen mass fraction @xmath31 for the model with the highest rate @xmath37 , where the hydrogen still remains at the center .",
    "the gr instability of smss has been studied for stellar models with the polytropic equation of state with @xmath26 assuming that the entire star is radiation - pressure dominant . for the @xmath26 polytropic star",
    ", the critical central temperature above which the gr instability occurs can be written as @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f2 ] , the central temperature during the stable hydrogen and helium burning phase is roughly constant at @xmath41 for all the models .",
    "for this temperature , the critical mass for the gr instability is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is normalized with @xmath44 .",
    "with the mean molecular weight @xmath45 for the initial primordial abundance ( 1.33 for the pure helium matter ) , the critical mass is @xmath46 ( 0.06 , respectively ) .",
    "as shown in table  [ tb : t1 ] , the final mass in our case with @xmath47 is @xmath48 , smaller than the critical mass estimated above .",
    "in fact , the collapse in this case is not triggered by the gr instability .",
    "the star just collapses after exhausting the central hydrogen and helium . for @xmath49 ,",
    "on the other hand , the collapse occurs while the nuclear fusion is still in operation , suggesting that the gr instability causes the collapse .",
    "the final masses in these cases are , however , again much larger than the critical masses for the polytropic stars given by equation ( [ eq : mcr ] ) .    to understand these differences ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : f3 ] ( top left ) the entropy distribution inside the star at three different epochs for the case with @xmath50 , where effects of the gr instability is the most prominent .",
    "recall that the polytrope models presume the spatially constant specific entropy in the interior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : f3 ] , however , this is not the case for our accreting stellar models , for which the outer envelope has higher entropy than in the core .",
    "since such an envelope is gravitationally loosely bound , higher total stellar mass is required for the gr instability in the accreting models than in the polytropic model .",
    "another useful expression for the gr - instability criterion is given by @xcite for a polytropic star with the index @xmath51 , which states that the star is gr unstable if @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the stellar radius .",
    "for a highly radiation - dominant state as in smss , the adiabatic index in the equation of state can be approximated as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the ratio of the gas pressure to total pressure .",
    "the criterion for the gr instability can thus be written as @xmath56 note that this condition is obtained for a spatially constant @xmath57 , i.e. , for a constant @xmath58 , which is inversely proportional to the specific entropy @xmath59 as @xmath60 for @xmath61 . in our case",
    ", this condition should be applied to the isentropic core .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f3 ] we show the distributions of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath40 for @xmath50 at three different epochs with @xmath64 and 0.8 .",
    "we define the surface of the isentropic core ( with mass @xmath65 ) as the shell where the specific entropy becomes larger than the central value by 1% ; @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 and 0.8 , respectively . as seen in the figure , as the stellar mass @xmath69 increases , @xmath58 becomes smaller while @xmath70 becomes larger at the same mass shell @xmath71 .",
    "owing to the high value of the specific entropy outside the core , @xmath58 becomes small in this region with the relation @xmath60 .",
    "the mean molecular weight @xmath40 increases toward the center as the hydrogen burning proceeds .",
    "the rise of @xmath70 with the total stellar mass indicates that the more massive star is more concentrated , as in the case for the ordinary primordial stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : f3 ] shows that , for @xmath72 , the condition ( [ eq : gr ] ) is not satisfied anywhere and the star is gr - stable . for @xmath73 ,",
    "the isentropic core is still gr - stable as condition ( [ eq : gr ] ) holds for @xmath74 , only outside the isentropic core @xmath75 .",
    "finally , when the stellar mass reaches @xmath76 , equation ( [ eq : gr ] ) is satisfied at the surface where @xmath77 , and the core begins to collapse .",
    "similarly , we find that the gr instability begins to operate satisfying the condition ( [ eq : gr ] ) at some moment for the cases with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , but never with @xmath47 . from this analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the gr instability causes the gravitational collapse for the models with @xmath49 .",
    "we first compare our results with the previous work by @xcite , who study the gr stability of hydrogen - burning stars with fixed masses .",
    "they define a star @xmath80 if the gr instability does not occur during the hydrogen burning stage .",
    "the critical stellar mass for the stability @xmath81 lies between @xmath69 = 0.1 and 0.25 .",
    "however , our calculations show that all the models except for @xmath82 are `` stable '' and begin collapsing after the exhaustion of the hydrogen at the center , when the stellar mass is well above @xmath81 .",
    "specifically , the star becomes gr - unstable during the helium - burning stage for @xmath83 with the final mass @xmath84 .",
    "the main difference from @xcite is that accreting stars that we consider here have a high - entropy envelope .",
    "hence the final masses ( including the outer envelope ) are larger than @xmath85 .",
    "the final stellar masses obtained in this _ letter _ should be regarded as upper mass limits for the remnant bhs after the collapse .",
    "@xcite argue that energetic supernova explosions occur at the collapse of smss in a very narrow mass strip around @xmath86 .",
    "since none of our models end up in this mass range , it is unlikely that such explosions are the final fate of our models",
    ". we will provide further results for this issue using a 1d - gr hydrodynamical code in a forthcoming paper .",
    "preliminary results suggest that the bhs with approximately the same mass as the progenitors will be left behind after the collapse .",
    "if the progenitor star is a rapid rotator , some mass ejection or even explosion may occur at the final stellar collapse .",
    "an accretion disk can appear around a rotating bh and some outflows or jets can be launched .",
    "@xcite , for instance , show by way of a gr hydrodynamics simulation that some portion of the stellar envelope is ejected while most of the stellar matter is drawn into a newborn bh .",
    "we conclude that an accreting protostar at a very large rate of @xmath87 grows to become a sms with mass @xmath88 .",
    "bhs with roughly the same mass will be left as remnants of such smss , which might have sown seeds for the formation of supermassive bhs in the early universe .",
