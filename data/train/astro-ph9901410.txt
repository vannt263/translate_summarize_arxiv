    "while for many years it was thought that initial conditions uniquely determined galaxy morphology ( eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage @xcite ) , it is now becoming apparent that morphology can be modified by physical processes ( e.g. , pfenniger , combes , & martinet @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that galaxy morphology can be used to study these processes , if a relationship can be established between a morphological feature and the physical mechanism responsible .",
    "the most striking features of disk galaxy morphology are nonaxisymmetric structures such as bars and spiral patterns .",
    "such structures can be caused by instabilities in galactic disks , and the interaction between bars and disks or bulges can give rise to angular momentum transfer and resonance phenomena .",
    "gas , because of its dissipative properties , is expected to have a substantial influence on the development of spiral structure and bars .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that bars can induce substantial inflows of gas ( schwarz @xcite ; friedli & benz @xcite ) , and the consequent evolution of the bar may create thickened structures that resemble bulges ( norman , sellwood , & hasan @xcite ; friedli & benz @xcite ) .",
    "environmental effects , such as tidal interactions and mergers , can also induce bars , as well as bridges , tails , multiple nuclei , and highly non - axisymmetric `` disturbed '' structure .",
    "interactions may also alter the hubble type in spirals , causing them to evolve from late - type unbarred systems toward barred earlier types ( elmegreen , elmegreen , & bellin @xcite ) .",
    "axisymmetric structures in galaxies , bulges and disks , may also be modified over time by these processes and others , and the hubble sequence itself may turn out to be an evolutionary one ( pfenniger , combes , & martinet @xcite ; martinet @xcite ) . if this were true , there could be a link between normal spiral evolution and the triggering of starburst and nuclear ( seyfert ) activity .",
    "these kinds of activity would be expected if such evolution , instead of proceeding at quiescent quasi - static rates , were to occur violently on relatively short timescales , and involve only modest fractions of the central mass .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the morphology of several classes of disk galaxies in an attempt to better understand the physical processes behind the creation and maintenance of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "much effort has been devoted to identifying the connection , if any , between host galaxy properties and the agn ( simkin , su , & schwarz @xcite ; su & simkin @xcite ; yee @xcite ; mackenty @xcite ; zitelli et al .",
    "@xcite ; danese et al .",
    "@xcite ; granato et al .",
    "@xcite ; kotilainen et al .",
    "@xcite ; kotilainen & ward @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , galactic bars which should facilitate the inward transport of gas to fuel the active nucleus ( shlosman , begelman , & frank @xcite ) are not ubiquitous in seyfert galaxies , even at the infrared wavelengths thought to favor bar detection ( mcleod & rieke @xcite ; mulchaey & regan @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , interactions are frequent in seyferts ( dahari @xcite ; mackenty @xcite ) , but not all seyferts are found in interacting systems ( de robertis , yee , & hayhoe @xcite ) .",
    "the only salient difference between seyfert and normal spiral _ morphology _ discovered to date is the near - infrared surface brightness of the disk ( hunt et al .",
    "@xcite ) : at 2@xmath0 m , seyfert disks turn out to be almost 1magarcsec@xmath3 brighter than those in normal early - type spirals .",
    "this paper is the first of a series aimed at the investigation of the host - galaxy / nuclear connection in agns and starbursts through qualitative and then quantitative galaxy morphology .",
    "our study is based on the extended 12@xmath0 m galaxy sample ( rush , malkan , & spinoglio @xcite  hereafter rms ) , and here we report an analysis , with data from the literature , of the hubble types , axial ratios , and bar and ring fractions .",
    "we also assess the impact of the infrared selection criterion on the star formation properties of the sample galaxies .",
    "future papers will present and analyze new optical and near - infrared images of the 12@xmath0 m seyferts that will enable us to further quantify the morphologies of these objects .",
    "we have chosen the extended 12@xmath0 m galaxy sample ( hereafter e12gs ) for several reasons .",
    "( 1 )  the 12@xmath0 m selection avoids biases associated with ultraviolet selection criteria which tend to favor blue seyfert 1s and quasars [ e.g. , markarian and green ( green , schmidt , & liebert @xcite ) ] .",
    "( 2 )  optically - selected magnitude - limited samples may be biased against faint nuclei embedded in bright galaxies ( e.g. , cfa seyfert sample : huchra & burg @xcite ) , but the 12@xmath0 m flux is an approximately constant fraction of the bolometric flux in both types of seyferts ( rms ) . ( 3 )  importantly for statistical studies , the 12@xmath0 m seyferts are numerous ( 116 ) and comprise the largest seyfert sample of both types yet compiled .",
    "( 4 )  12@xmath0 m seyferts are closer than the cfa seyferts , thus affording better spatial resolution and higher flux densities . ( 5 )  distances of the two types in the 12@xmath0 m seyferts are similar ( 69  mpc for seyfert 1s vs. 59  mpc for seyfert 2s ) so that conclusions drawn from type comparison should not suffer from resolution or distance / luminosity effects . ( 6 )  enhanced star formation activity may be favored by the infrared selection criterion , and evaluation of such a selection artifact may help better understand the relationship between seyfert activity and star formation .",
    "( 7 )  finally , the e12gs automatically guarantees similarly - selected control samples of hii / starbursts , liners , and non - active galaxies .",
    "the e12gs was defined by rms on the basis of 12@xmath0 m flux , and contains 891 galaxies .",
    "the flux limit is 0.22  jy , and the sample is estimated to be complete to 0.3  jy .",
    "the multiwavelength properties of seyferts in the 12@xmath0 m sample are discussed by rush & malkan ( @xcite ) ; rush et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; and rush , malkan , & edelson ( @xcite ) .",
    "near - infrared photometry of the galaxies in general is reported by spinoglio et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we are interested in the morphological characteristics of the 12@xmath0 m galaxies not only for their intrinsic interest , but also to assess any dependence on the 12@xmath0 m selection criterion . specifically , _ ( i )",
    "_  what are the hubble types of the 12@xmath0 m galaxies , and how do they compare with those for normal spirals and previous seyfert samples ? _",
    "( ii ) _  what are the axial ratios of the 12@xmath0 m galaxies , and how do they compare with optically - selected samples ? _ ( iii ) _  how does the bar fraction of the 12@xmath0 m galaxies compare with that for normal spirals , and how does it vary with activity class and hubble type ?",
    "_ ( iv ) _",
    "what fraction of 12@xmath0 m galaxies have rings ?    to this end , we used the spectroscopic classifications of the e12gs ( hii / starburst , liner , seyfert 1 or 2 ) from the nasa / ipac extraglactic database , ned . from these classifications , three subsets of the 12@xmath0 m galaxies were derived : hii / starburst ( 67 objects ) , liner ( 33 objects ) , and `` non - active '' ( neither hii / starbursts , nor liners , nor seyferts : 626 objects , hereafter referred to as `` normal '' ) .",
    "ambiguous designations such as hii@xmath4liner ( 8 objects ) , hii@xmath4sy ( 6 ) , liner@xmath4sy ( 14 ) have been separated out in order to better represent `` pure '' activity classes , although we have analyzed them where necessary to evaluate the validity of possibly low - significance results .",
    "the resulting percentage of `` active '' galaxies in the e12gs is roughly 30% , as opposed to the 20% value given in rms .",
    "the increase is in large part due to the different definition and consequent greater number of hii / starbursts here , and to the inclusion of ambiguous classifications .",
    "more observations in the literature and continuous updates of ned also contribute to the increase .",
    "29 galaxies are classified as seyferts in ned , but are not part of the 12@xmath0 m seyfert samples , and , conversely , 22 of the 116 12@xmath0 m seyferts are not designated as such in ned .",
    "hence , there may be some doubt about the strict membership of the activity - class subsamples we have defined , although the samples should be large enough to submerge small random effects of mistyping .",
    "morphological types , bar and ring classes , and major and minor diameters were taken from ned , and the distributions of these compared among the subsets defined above . the optically - selected cfa sample of seyferts ( huchra & burg @xcite ) is also considered in the analysis ,",
    "so as to better assess any selection effects introduced by the 12@xmath0 m criterion ( see @xmath5  [ sfm ] ) .",
    "the ned revised morphological types are typically taken from the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "the hubble stage or type index ( t ) is derived from these according to the principles outlined in rc3 .",
    "when an object is tagged `` pec''(uliar ) , but has a well - defined type , we included it in the analysis .",
    "`` peculiar '' morphology is shown by only 19% of the normal 12@xmath0 m galaxies , by roughly 25% of the 12@xmath0 m seyferts ( 21 and 27% for types 1 and 2 , respectively ) , by 35% of the liners , and by almost half ( 45% ) of the 12@xmath0 m hii spirals .",
    "the distributions of hubble type index for the different subsamples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : morph ] .",
    "it is apparent that the normal 12@xmath0 m galaxies are predominantly spirals , as expected , and that there are fewer very late - type spirals relative to the ugc distribution ( although both have median t  =  4  =  sbc ) .",
    "the 12@xmath0 m and cfa seyfert 1s tend to be early - type spirals ( median t  =  1  =  sa ) , while the 12@xmath0 m hii galaxies and liners tend towards later types ( medians t  =  3,3.5  =  sb , sbc , respectively ) ; seyfert 2s are intermediate between the two with median t  =  2  =  sab .",
    "that seyferts tend to reside in early - type spirals has been known for some time ( terlevich , melnick , & moles @xcite ; moles , mrquez , & prez @xcite ) .",
    "the trend found here of morphological types in seyfert galaxies is also similar to that of the palomar spectroscopic survey ( ho , filippenko , & sargent @xcite ) , and of a large sample of nearby seyferts ( malkan , gorjian , & tam ( @xcite ; hereafter mgt ) .",
    "however , the 12@xmath0 m hii galaxies tend towards earlier types and the liners towards later types than those detected in the palomar survey ( ho , filippenko , & sargent @xcite ) .",
    "this may be a luminosity effect since the palomar survey tends towards low luminosities , or it could be related to the 12@xmath0 m selection and dust or gas content .",
    "the median morphological type of both 12@xmath0 m and cfa seyfert 2s lies between seyfert 1s and hii galaxies / liners ( individual typing uncertainties are t  @xmath6  0.7buta et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a trend confirmed by the ambiguous sub - samples : liner / sy galaxies have median t  =  2 , hii / sys t  =  3 , and hii / liners t  =  4 .",
    "there appears to be a global progression from normal spirals and liners ( median sbc ) , to hii / starbursts ( sb ) , to seyfert 2s ( sab ) , and seyfert 1s ( sa ) .",
    "the intrinsic shape of spiral disks may be derived from distributions of axial ratios and has been extensively studied ( sandage , freeman , & stokes @xcite ; binney & de vaucouleurs @xcite ; fasano et al .",
    "@xcite ; odewahn , burstein , & windhorst @xcite ) .",
    "here we compare the axial ratios in the e12gs with those of normal spirals , and with optically - selected seyfert samples .",
    "the distributions of the axial ratios of the galaxies in the e12gs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : incl ] .",
    "the normal 12@xmath0 m galaxies exhibit an axial - ratio distribution entirely consistent with normal disk galaxies , being roughly flat from @xmath7 down to @xmath6  0.2 ( binney & de vaucouleurs @xcite ) .",
    "optically - selected seyfert galaxies tend to avoid edge - on systems ( keel @xcite ) , partly because of the bias of ( optical ) magnitude - limited samples against extremely inclined systems ( burstein , haynes , & faber @xcite ; fasano et al .",
    "@xcite ; maiolino & rieke @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the cfa seyferts show a strong deficiency of highly inclined disks , especially for the type 1s : the mean @xmath8 for the cfa type 1s ( 2s ) is 0.80 ( 0.77 ) , compared with 0.56 for the normal 12@xmath0 m galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : incl ] shows that the 12@xmath0 m seyfert galaxies are much less affected by this bias than the cfa sample , as the mean @xmath8 for the 12@xmath0 m type 1s ( 2s ) is 0.65 ( 0.64 ) .",
    "11% of the type 2 seyferts , and 13% of the type 1s have @xmath8@xmath90.4 , versus none of the cfa seyferts .",
    "a similar lack of edge - on seyfert 2s has been noted by mcleod & rieke ( @xcite ) , who attributed it to obscuration on scales of @xmath6100  pc or more .",
    "the liners and hii galaxies have a mean @xmath8 of 0.59 .",
    "only 9% of the hii galaxies have @xmath8@xmath90.4 , which implies that if obscuration causes the deficiency of highly inclined galaxies , it operates equally well whether an agn or a starburst is present .",
    "70% of the normal sample and roughly half of each of the active samples have bar classes defined , and those galaxies with bar definitions have been divided into three categories : unbarred ( sa ) ; barred ( sab or sb ) ; and strongly barred ( sb ) .",
    "table [ tbl : bars ] gives the results of this division .",
    "it turns out that 69% of the normal galaxies are barred , in good agreement with the magnitude - limited sample of northern spirals with @xmath1013 of which 68% have bars ( see moles et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but slightly higher than the 60% fraction in field spirals ( sellwood & wilkinson @xcite ) and in the palomar survey spirals ( ho , filippenko , & sargent @xcite ) . if we apply a velocity constraint and consider only those sources with @xmath115000kms@xmath12 , the bar fraction is 68% .",

    "this is yet another confirmation of the emerging consensus that bars occur in seyferts with the same frequency as they occur in the normal spiral population ( see introduction and references therein ) .",
    "recent work has suggested that bars and distortions are more frequent in type 2 seyferts than in type 1s ( maiolino et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for the 12@xmath0 m seyferts , however , this is not the case as the bar fraction ( with @xmath13  5000kms@xmath12 ) is greater for type 1s ( 70% ) than for type 2s ( 63% ) .",
    "it is only marginally the case for the cfa sample which has 67% of seyfert 2s barred versus 64% of seyfert 1s , although if all distances are considered , the differences between the two types in the cfa sample are more pronounced ( 56% type 1s vs. 67% type 2s , see table [ tbl : bars ] ) . more and higher - quality image data are needed to decide if the difference is significant , and if so , if it results from optical selection .",
    "we turn finally to the variation of bar fraction with morphological type .",
    "although the counting statistics are sufficiently large only for the normal sample , we have analyzed bar fraction as a function of hubble type as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bar2 ] ; the data have been binned as described in the figure caption . very late - type normal e12gs galaxies show a higher percentage of bars than early types , as also found by ho et al .",

    "the median value of the hii / starbursts was used as the threshold : @xmath30=0.51 ; galaxies with the far - infared flux ratio greater than this value were ( arbitrarily ) considered `` star - forming '' , and the others `` quiescent '' . with this criterion",

    "the occurrence of bars in the star - forming galaxies is significantly ( 4.8-@xmath16 ) higher than the quiescent category ( 86% versus 63% ) only for the normal galaxies ; there is no equivalent trend for hii / starbursts , liners , or seyferts .",
    "normal star - forming galaxies also have a higher percentage of _ outer _ rings than their quiescent counterparts ( 24% versus 8% ) , with a significance of 2.4@xmath16 ; the same is true for seyfert 1s ( 83% versus 28% , 3@xmath16 ) , but not for seyfert 2s ( 40% versus 33% ) .",
    "an opposing trend emerges for _ inner _ rings , with quiescent normal galaxies having a higher inner ring fraction ( 50% ) than the star - forming ones ( 37% ) , an effect which is only marginally significant at 2.1@xmath16 .",

    "nevertheless , even the quiescent seyferts have outer ring fractions of around 30% .",
    "we conclude then that the high outer ring fraction found in seyferts is not an artifact of the the 12@xmath0 m selection criterion , which may favor more recent star formation .      the hrs model for dust emission",

[",
    "fig : smg ] must therefore arise from the mid - infrared excess observed in seyferts ( miley , neugebauer , & soifer @xcite ; edelson & malkan @xcite ) , attributed to an agn , either emission directly from the nucleus or from dust heated by it .",
    "we have also examined the `` warm '' and `` cold '' fractions of the 12@xmath0 m galaxies on the basis of the mid - infrared flux ratio @xmath36 . following soifer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , we distinguish between `` warm '' and `` cold '' with @xmath36=0.17 , and find 21% of the normal 12@xmath0 m galaxies to be warm , as opposed to the 16% fraction in the 60-@xmath0 m selected bgs .",
    "this higher percentage is almost certainly due to the 12@xmath0 m flux selection criterion because of the correlation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the warm fractions of hii / starbursts ( 18% ) and liners ( 13% ) are similar to the bgs , while the much greater fractions ( almost 60% ) fractions of warm seyferts arise from the mid - infrared excess cited above .",
    "we have investigated the occurrence of rings and bars in warm and cold galaxies in the e12gs .",
    "it turns out that the ring fractions in hii / starbursts and liners are similar for warm and cold objects , but the outer ring fraction in warm normal 12@xmath0 m galaxies is greater ( 17% ) than in cold ones ( 9% ) , a significant trend at 3.1-@xmath16 .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for the outer rings in seyferts : 54% ( 50% ) of warm seyfert 1s ( 2s ) have outer rings , versus 33% ( 18% ) of cold seyferts , but only the difference in seyfert 2s is marginally significant at 1.9@xmath16 .",

    "the analysis of the infrared properties of the e12gs reveals that :    1 .",
    "the @xmath37 ratios of galaxies in the e12gs are intermediate between optically - selected and 60@xmath0m - selected samples , but tend to be higher in the hii / starbursts and in the seyfert 2s .",

    "deviations from the dust model in seyferts seems to be due to their excess emission at 25@xmath0 m , thought to have origin in either dust heated by the agn , or in the agn itself .",
    "bar fractions in the e12gs are significantly greater for greater far - infrared flux ratio @xmath27 _ only for the normal galaxies _ ; no class shows a dependence of bar fractions on @xmath36 .",
    "5 .   outer rings in normal galaxies and seyferts tend to prefer higher @xmath27 and @xmath36 , while for inner rings the reverse is true .",
    "nevertheless , the high outer ring fractions in seyferts and the high inner ring fraction in liners do not appear to be the result of a selection artifact .",
    "these considerations lead us to conclude that the 12@xmath0 m selection criterion does influence the star - formation activity of the e12gs , but the effect is mild compared to that of 60@xmath0 m selection .",
    "not unexpectedly , the 12@xmath0 m hii / starbursts display extreme values of the `` star - formation '' indicators , but they are compatible with trends predicted by two - component dust models .",
    "the infrared properties of the 12@xmath0 m seyferts may be partly affected by recent star formation activity , at least in seyfert 2s , but there is undeniably a strong contribution from an agn , since @xmath31 correlates very well with the mid - infrared flux ratio @xmath36 , known to be an indicator of seyfert activity .",
    "we have examined the morphological attributes and global star - formation characteristics of the 891 galaxies in the e12gs . in what follows ,",
    "we attempt to link together some of the results , and provide a coherent picture of what they might imply for galaxies hosting agns and starbursts in particular , and for spiral galaxies in general .",
    "if we simply assume that the _ intrinsic _ distribution of @xmath8 in the seyfert host galaxies must be uniform , like what we observe in the normal 12@xmath0 m galaxies , we can estimate how many inclined seyferts are missing from the 12@xmath0 m sample . even if _ all of the seyferts _ within the flux limit were picked up by the e12gs ,",
    "the identification of their seyfert nuclei still rests on optical spectroscopy , which could be incomplete in the presence of large extinction in the body of the host galaxy .",
    "the @xmath8 distributions of the 12@xmath0 m seyfert 1s and 2s can be made identical to that of the normal galaxies with the addition of 5 highly inclined ( @xmath410.4 ) seyfert 1s , and 5 highly inclined seyfert 2s .",
    "this corresponds to incompletenesses of 12% and 9% for the seyfert 1s and 2s , respectively .",
    "this may be however an overestimate , especially for type 1s with a median hubble type of sa , since the axial - ratio distributions of the 12@xmath0 m seyferts are very similar to those of normal early - type spirals ( binney & de vaucouleurs @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ why - are - outer - rings - but - not - bars - abnormally - frequent - in - seyfert - nuclei ] ] why are outer rings but not bars abnormally frequent in seyfert nuclei ?",
    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    previous researchers suggested that , since many reasonably - sized galaxies already harbor massive black holes , perhaps from their early formation days , the key to making them seyferts is a gas supply that can fuel their nucleus during the current epoch .",
    "alternatively , black holes could be formed and maintained by normal stellar evolution in a massive compact nuclear star cluster ( norman & scoville @xcite ) .",
    "either way , any dynamical mechanism that can redistribute angular momentum , and cause gas to spiral in very close to the center , should be strongly associated with central bursts of star formation and observed nuclear activity",
    ".    bars , or nested bars , are thought to be such a mechanism .",
    "in fact they probably _ do _ function in this way , because they seem to be helpful in promoting a burst of star formation in the center of a  normal \" galaxy , as indicated in @xmath5[sample ] .",
    "however , it is not understood why bars do _ not _ promote seyfert nuclear activity , even in any weak statistical sense .",
    "one answer to this dilemma may lie in the large fraction of outer rings in seyferts .",
    "buta & combes ( @xcite ) discuss the observational and theoretical properties of rings in spiral galaxies , and we mention here a few points germane to our discussion but not already mentioned previously .",
    "first , bars in galaxies require between 2 and 5@xmath42  yrs to form ( combes & elmegreen @xcite ) ; subsequently , formation of nuclear and inner rings requires roughly @xmath43  yrs , and outer rings about 3@xmath44  yrs .",
    "second , while outer rings ( _ r _ ) can be sustained for a hubble time in the absence of tidal interactions , in dense environments they are relatively fragile and tend to be either completely destroyed or converted into pseudo - rings ( _ r@xmath45 _ ) .",
    "third , inner or nuclear rings can have a lifetime as short as @xmath43  yrs , because of nuclear gas inflow and consequent star formation .",
    "fourth , because of the long time necessary for the formation of an outer ring , true outer rings would not be expected to be observed preferentially in strongly barred galaxies .",
    "this last is true because strong bars are thought to be only a transient phase in the life of the galaxy , as they can be dissolved or converted into lenses or triaxial configurations by massive gas flow to the center .",
    "it follows that rings may supplant bars as signals of historical angular momentum transfer late in the life of the galaxy .",
    "seyfert galaxies , with their high ring frequency , may have reached an advanced stage in their evolution which would be characterized by `` older '' indicators of angular - momentum transfer .",
    "such timescale considerations would also help explain the extremely high bar fraction in hii / starburst galaxies .",
    "if bars , associated with centralized starbursts , signal mass transfer _ only early on in the galaxies development _",
    ", then we could interpret the low outer - ring fraction in hii galaxies as an indication of lack of time ; outer rings have not yet had time to form in starbursts .",
    "on the other hand , 80% ( of the 20% ) _ unbarred _ hii fraction present inner rings ; such structures would have had sufficient formation time if the timescales delineating `` early '' and `` late '' ( or young and old ) are roughly @xmath43 and @xmath2  yrs , respectively .",
    "an implication of this scenario is that the  trigger delay time \" for seyfert activity should be much longer than that for starbursts .",
    "the core idea of agn unification schemes is that apparently different types of nuclear activity may in fact be intrinsically similar , if only we could observe them more fully .",
    "two examples of agn unification are the hypotheses that : _ i _ ) the emission lines in  classical \" liners are photoionized by a hard continuum , the same as in seyfert 2 nuclei , except that the ionization parameter is lower because of the lower intensity of radiation reaching the emitting clouds ; or _ ii _ ) each narrow - line agn ( e.g. seyfert 2 ) actually contains a broad - line region like those in seyfert 1s , but something obscures it from our view .",
    "one implication of the unification hypotheses is that the apparently different types of active nuclei should reside in statistically similar galactic environments . in other words ,",
    "the host galaxy should not  make much difference \" to the agn , if they are all fundamentally the same kind of objects .",
    "thus a ( negative ) test is proposed : are there any significant differences between the host galaxies of different classes of agns ? as usual , the most difficult aspect of such tests is finding suitably unbiased samples , so that apparent differences are not artificially produced by selection effects .",
    "this was a strong motivation for our morphological study of the host galaxies of the 12@xmath0 m agn . in terms of bars , the 12@xmath0 m",
    "agn pass the unification test , since we could not find any significant differences among agn types .",
    "in contrast , the hii - region galaxies show a higher bar frequency . in this",
    "regard , then , liner galaxies resemble more the seyferts than the hii / starbursts .    in our relatively unbiased agn sample",
    ", we found apparent host - galaxy differences among different agn types : _ i _ ) the liners appear to have an unusually high incidence of _ inner _",
    "( @xmath46  yrs formation time ) rings , in contrast to the seyfert 1s which have an unusually high incidence of _ outer _ ( @xmath47  yrs formation time ) rings .",
    "this complicates the simplest version of unification for liners and seyferts .",
    "one possible embellishing solution , for example , might be to postulate that liner and seyfert nuclei are the same objects , but seen at different evolutionary stages , as revealed by the differences in the rings in their host galaxies ( see above ) .",
    "_ ii _ ) the seyfert 2s appear to have later morphological types than seyfert 1s . again a possible complication could be that seyfert 2 nuclei are dustier , creating more obscuration along more lines - of - sight ( see discussion in mgt ) .",
    "we could carry the proposed negative test further by formulating a counter - hypothesis : seyfert , liner , and starburst activity in galaxies could be directly related to the evolutionary status of the galaxy , at least since its last major disturbance .",
    "previous work ( see introduction ) suggests that non - axisymmetric perturbations , such as bars , induce rapid evolution of spiral disks through transfer of angular momentum ; evolution in this sense is most likely from late to early spiral types ( pfenniger @xcite ; martinet @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of gas is fundamental in this process because of its dissipative properties and destabilizing influence .",
    "it follows that seyfert nuclei , hosted by predominantly early - type spirals , would represent a more evolved manifestation of activity ( central gas deposit ) than either liners or starbursts which tend to be found in later hubble types .",
    "type 1 seyferts would also be older , more evolved , than type 2s since they are found in slightly earlier morphological types .",
    "the high frequency of outer rings in seyferts , inner rings in liners , and bars in hii / starbursts would also follow , since the different formation times and lifetimes of these structures would reflect differences in the evolutionary stage of the galaxies . if peculiar morphologies reflect recent ( young ) disturbances , likely since they occurred more frequently in the past ( van den bergh @xcite , and references therein ) , then the peculiar fractions that decrease systematically going from hii / starbursts ( 45% ) , to liners ( 37% ) , seyfert 2s ( 27% ) , and seyfert 1s ( 21% ) obey a similar trend in evolutionary status .",
    "the high hi mass fractions in starbursts that decrease going to seyfert 2s and 1s , together with an opposing trend in disk surface brightness ( hunt et al .",
    "@xcite ) are also compatible with such a progression of activity and hubble type . finally , an evolutionary sequence from starbursts to seyfert 2s , to type 1s ( e.g. , oliva et al .",
    "@xcite ) would be a possible consequence .    in the same vein ,",
    "if seyfert 2 nuclei were younger / less evolved than type 1s , and considering that type 2 nuclei tend to be weaker relative to the galaxy than type 1s ( yee @xcite ) , we would deduce that the intensity of nuclear activity increases with age .",
    "if age goes hand - in - hand with morphological type , we might therefore expect to find trends with measures of nuclear activity .",
    "figure [ fig : agn ] , where the mid - infrared flux ratio @xmath36 is plotted against the hubble type index , may show such a trend . as discussed in @xmath5[mid ] , @xmath36 is a good indicator of seyfert activity , and the figure shows a correlation between it and hubble type t ; the correlation is significant at @xmath1499.9% ( two - tailed ) .",
    "as the mid - infrared flux ratio becomes larger , the morphological types become earlier , and the nuclei older and more intense , if time increases to the left as it would were our hypothesis correct .",
    "if @xmath36 measures black hole mass , presumably related to nuclear intensity , such a trend would also be consistent with the correlation between black hole mass and total bulge luminosity ( kormendy & richstone @xcite ) , since early - type spirals tend to have more luminous bulges than late types .    while our findings are inconsistent with some of the consequences of the unification scheme for agns , and perhaps more consistent with other hypotheses , our study suffers from limitations .",
    "we have used qualitative data from the literature , and some of the results are of necessity plagued by small - number statistics .",
    "high - quality multiwaveband image data are needed to systematically quantify the occurrence of bars , rings , and lenses , and to better evaluate their influence on the galaxy as a whole .",
    "indeed , lenses may follow from bar dissolution ( combes @xcite ) , but the lack of consistent literature data in this regard precluded analysis .",

    "<S> the 12@xmath0 m seyferts show a small ( 10% ) deficiency of edge - on disks . </S>",
    "<S> this is caused by extinction , but is a much less severe effect than in optically - selected samples . </S>",
    "<S> there is a similar modest deficit of highly inclined hii / starburst galaxies in the 12@xmath0 m sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the galaxies with active nuclei ( agns : seyferts and liners ) have the same incidence of bars as normal spirals , but show rings significantly more often than normal galaxies or starbursts . </S>",
    "<S> the liners have elevated rates of _ inner _ rings , while the seyferts have _ outer _ ring fractions several times those in normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the different formation times of bars and rings suggest an interpretation of these differences . </S>",
    "<S> bars form relatively quickly , and indicate that material is recently being transported ( by redistribution of angular momentum ) to the center of the galaxy , where it is likely to trigger a short ( e.g. , @xmath1 yrs ) burst of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> outer rings may result from similar disturbances , but require much more time to form . </S>",
    "<S> they would then be associated with more intense nuclear activity if it takes @xmath2 years or more for the mass transfer to reach the center and raise the black hole accretion rate , by which time the bar has dissolved or begun to do so . </S>",
    "<S> inner rings form before outer ones , with a formation time more comparable to bars . </S>",
    "<S> thus it may be that after an interaction or instability triggers an infall of gas , the galaxy in the earliest stage is likely to show enhanced star formation in its center , while later it is more likely to show liner activity , and still later likely to be a seyfert .    </S>",
    "<S> the trends we find with morphology and nuclear activity are not biased either by the distances of the galaxies , or by the slightly elevated recent star formation rates shown by the 12@xmath0 m galaxies in general . </S>"
