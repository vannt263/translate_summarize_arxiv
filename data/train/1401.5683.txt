    "the hydrodynamics of superfluids confined in containers or channels of complex geometry is relevant to a variety of experimentally studied systems .",
    "the absence of friction in a superfluid and the irrotational nature of superfluid flow ( in the absence of vortices ) lead to a variety of unusual hydrodynamic effects that depend crucially on the confining geometry .    a large number of experimental investigations into superfluidity in trapped , ultracold atomic systems  @xcite have been carried out in recent years .",
    "various signatures of superfluidity , such as persistent flow , reduction in the moment of inertia due to the frictionless nature of the superfluid ( the so - called non - classical rotational inertia ( ncri ) ) and formation of quantized vortices have been observed in both bosonic  @xcite and fermionic  @xcite systems . in all these experiments ,",
    "the superfluid is confined in a small region by an external trapping potential .",
    "while the early experiments on such systems were carried out for traps with simple geometry , more recent ones have begun to explore the properties of superfluid condensates in traps with a more complex structure .",
    "superfluid flow in a toroidal trap has been observed  @xcite , and the effects of a repulsive optical barrier that tends to block the superflow have been investigated in recent experiments  @xcite .",
    "studies of superfluid hydrodynamics in containers with complex geometry are obviously relevant for understanding the results of experiments on superfluidity in atomic systems confined in such traps .",
    "motivation for studies of superfluid hydrodynamics in confined geometries is also provided by reports  @xcite of an abrupt change in the resonant period of a torsional oscillator filled with solid @xmath3 , initially interpreted as ncri in solid @xmath3 , at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "while the interpretation is controversial  @xcite , a possible explanation  @xcite is that superfluidity occurs in solid @xmath3 along extended crystal defects such as dislocation lines and grain boundaries which form complex disordered structures .",
    "studies of the flow properties of a superfluid confined in channels and networks of irregular geometry are obviously useful for assessing the validity of such theories . the hydrodynamics of superfluids confined in containers of simple geometries , such as spherical , cylindrical or rectangular , has been studied extensively  @xcite in the past .",
    "these studies , all in the incompressible limit , were recently extended  @xcite by two of us to more complex geometries , such as wedges and blocked rings , both in the case where there are no vortices ( so that the superfluid flow is irrotational ) and the case where a single vortex was present .",
    "the same authors carried out a study@xcite on the effects of superfluidity along grain boundaries in a two - dimensional bosonic system . while the results of these studies could be applied to experiments involving superfluid @xmath4he , they were not directly applicable to cold atomic systems because of the incompressibility assumption .",
    "this assumption constrains the local density in equilibrium to be uniform throughout the system .",
    "while this is an extremely good approximation for superfluid @xmath4he , it is not a good one for cold atomic systems in which the presence of a confining potential causes the equilibrium density to be substantially inhomogeneous .",
    "this inhomogeneity has significant effects on the superfluid properties of the confined atomic system , as found in both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite investigations .",
    "therefore , it was doubtful if the results of these earlier studies  @xcite would be valid for cold atomic systems .",
    "for example , calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the velocity field for a superfluid confined in a two - dimensional wedge with opening angle @xmath5 diverges at the tip of the wedge for _ any _ nonzero value of the angular velocity @xmath6 of the wedge about an axis perpendicular to it and passing through its tip .",
    "this divergence could be removed by the nucleation of a single vortex .",
    "this implies that either a normal region near the tip of the wedge or a vortex must be present for any nonzero value of @xmath6 .",
    "the size of the region near the tip where the velocity exceeds the critical velocity was estimated to be too small to be experimentally observable for liquid @xmath4he , but it was found that it may be observable in cold atomic systems . however , the validity of the results for cold atomic systems could not be established because the calculation was carried out for an incompressible superfluid .",
    "in general , firm conclusions for cold atomic systems can not be drawn from hydrodynamic calculations performed under the assumption of incompressibility and uniform equilibrium density .",
    "clearly , a method in which this assumption is removed is needed for studies of the hydrodynamics of these systems .    to accomplish this purpose ,",
    "we start , in this paper , with the hydrodynamic equations for a compressible superfluid .",
    "although the effect of compressibility in cold atomic systems has been studied via the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite , it is simpler for our purpose of perturbatively studying the compressibility corrections , to start directly with the hydrodynamic limit and the associated coarse grained equations based on conservation of mass and momentum .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations we consider can be obtained  @xcite from the gp equation if a quantum stress term , known  @xcite to be unimportant in the hydrodynamic regime , is neglected .",
    "the procedure we use to solve the hydrodynamic equations is based on an expansion in parameter @xmath0 , the square of the mach number , where @xmath1 is some characteristic speed of the problem and @xmath2 is the speed of sound .",
    "such expansions have been previously used@xcite in other quantum fluids problems .",
    "our expansion procedure leads to linear differential equations , which makes it much easier to find analytic solutions : this is a considerable advantage of our method . at zeroth order in this small parameter one",
    "recovers the incompressible results , since @xmath2 is then formally infinite .",
    "our expansion , as it will be seen , is particulary convenient to the study of situations where a flow is imposed on the system by external means .",
    "we then proceed to apply this procedure to two specific situations in this category . although these have been chosen largely because analytic solutions in the incompressible limit can either be easily obtained or already exist , both of these situations have been realized in experiments on cold atomic systems . in the first case",
    ", we assume that external constraints confine the superfluid in such a way as to produce a gaussian profile for the local density of the stationary superfluid , a situation similar to that considered experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite and theoretically in refs .",
    "the specific force fields required to establish this distribution drop out of the equations : only the resulting density distribution matters .",
    "we then , for this example , assume that a flow corresponding to one quantum of axial circulation ( i.e. a single vortex ) is established in such a way that it is a solution of the zeroth order hydrodynamic equations , and evaluate the first order corrections to the velocity field and to the density due to finite compressibility .",
    "in the second problem we consider afresh the obstructed cylinder situation previously studied@xcite in the incompressible limit and again evaluate the first order corrections to both components of the velocity field , and to the density , due to the finite compressibility .",
    "the geometry considered here is similar to that of recent experiments  @xcite on bose - einstein condensates in a toroidal trap with a repulsive barrier . in both cases",
    "we find , as expected , that the corrections are vanishingly small for liquid he .",
    "on the other hand , we find that for typical cold atomic systems the corrections due to finite compressibility are often not negligible but that they are sufficiently small to be amenable to our perturbative solution .",
    "the observation that corrections due to finite compressibility in cold atomic systems in the hydrodynamic regime are amenable to perturbative solution for the two widely different problems considered here is interesting because it suggests that similar perturbative treatments would be possible for other problems of interest in studies of superfluidity in cold atomic systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ methods ] , we present the details of the perturbative method of calculation used here . the results obtained from application of this method to the problems mentioned above are described in detail in section  [ result ] .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] contains a summary of the main results and concluding remarks .",
    "as explained above , our objective is to study the effect of compressibility on superfluid hydrodynamics in confined geometries , starting with the results for incompressible fluids .",
    "the behavior of compressible normal liquids has been studied as early as 1883  @xcite . starting with the general equations governing inviscid fluid flow -the continuity and euler equations",
    "- we use a perturbative method to study the effect of finite compressibility in the limit where the perturbation parameter , while low , is nonzero .",
    "we will see that this is a realistic limit for cold atomic systems of experimental interest .",
    "our perturbative method has similarities to that used in ref .",
    "that study focuses on the propagation of sound waves , a limit where the perturbation parameter can not be assumed to be much smaller than unity .",
    "the small dimensionless parameter associated with the perturbative expansion is the mach number , the ratio of the characteristic fluid velocity to the sound speed . for quantum systems ,",
    "such expansions have been used earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite which address a very different problem of the critical speed for the nucleation of vortices in superfluid flow around a disk as compared to our present work on flow patterns for superfluids in confined geometries . the procedure will be illustrated by calculating , for two examples of confined superfluids , the corrections to the velocity field and the density distribution in the low temperature limit where viscosity effects can be neglected .",
    "as a simpler alternative to deriving the equations of compressible superfluid hydrodynamics via the gp equation , we start with the fundamental hydrodynamic equations governing fluid flow in the steady state i.e. mass conservation as given by the continuity equation : @xmath7 and momentum conservation as given by the euler equation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass density , @xmath10 represents the velocity field , @xmath11 the pressure , and @xmath12 is the external force per unit volume . the steady state assumption means , as usual , that we are averaging over microscopic scale time fluctuations .",
    "hydrodynamics can also be derived by starting from microscopic or quasi microscopic equations of motion and then coarse graining .",
    "when one does that from the gp equations@xcite one obtains in the euler equation an additional quantum stress term .",
    "this term need not be included here for two reasons : first , as explained on page 170 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) the order of magnitude of this term ( which involves third derivatives of the density ) is down by a factor of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a microscopic quantum length and @xmath15 the characteristic length associated with macroscopic pressure variations : it is hence negligible for the hydrodynamic problems considered here .",
    "secondly , this term ( involving as it does density derivatives ) vanishes at @xmath16 and , since it appears in the same way as the term @xmath12 , it would similarly acquire an explicit factor of @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ ns1a ] ) below .",
    "it is therefore a second or higher order correction in our small parameter .",
    "short range fluctuations may exist , just as they do in classical fluids , but they are averaged over the macroscopic distance @xmath15 in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "such a scale clearly exists in experimental bose systems : the thomas - fermi radius of trapped bose gases can be between two or three orders of magnitude larger than the microscopic coherence length . from experiments on superfluid flow in bose systems",
    "@xcite it can be seen that the characteristic mach number squared , our dimensionless expansion parameter @xmath0 , is of order @xmath18 and hence small in these systems .",
    "the thomas - fermi approximation predicts an abrupt drop to zero in the density of the condensate beyond the thomas - fermi radius , but this is an artifact of the thomas - fermi method : the actual variation in density is smoother .",
    "this does not affect the validity of our approach just as the abrupt density drop near a wall does not invalidate classical hydrodynamics given that a large region over which the parameter @xmath0 is small exists .",
    "we consider @xmath9 to be a function of @xmath11 only ( barotropic limit ) .",
    "this limit applies@xcite in the very low temperature case that we study : at zero temperature @xmath11 can only be a function of @xmath9 . using the definition of compressibility ( @xmath19 ) , eq.([ns ] )",
    "becomes : @xmath20 we now start the perturbative calculation by writing : @xmath21 @xmath22 where the zero index denotes quantities in the incompressible ( @xmath23 ) limit and the index one in @xmath24 denotes the changes in velocity field and density distribution due to the finite compressibility .",
    "substituting eqs .",
    "( [ zeroone ] ) and ( [ zeroonev ] ) into eqs  ( [ cont ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) , the euler equation at zeroth order takes the form:@xmath25 which reflects the fact that at @xmath16 it would take an infinite force to induce a density gradient ( here and below , we consider the product @xmath26 to be finite , of order unity ) . for future convenience , let us assume that such a density gradient has somehow been induced by external means . in that case the zero order continuity equation would take the form : @xmath27 which reduces to the usual form @xmath28 in the absence of external forces . here",
    "we have introduced the operator : @xmath29 proceeding now to first order , the corresponding terms in the continuity equation yield : @xmath30 while from those in the euler equation we have : @xmath31 taking the scalar product of eq .",
    "( [ ns1 ] ) with @xmath32 and making use of eqs .",
    "( [ cont1 ] ) and ( [ cont0 ] ) one obtains : @xmath33 by this procedure the external force has been eliminated from the equations .",
    "the reason this is possible is that the only role of the force is to impose the zeroth order density profile , @xmath34 , which alone has physical meaning .",
    "( [ cont0 ] ) , ( [ cont1 ] ) and ( [ ns11 ] ) are the basic set of equations needed . in general ,",
    "the best course to obtain the first order results , after getting the zeroth order solution , is to solve first eq .  ( [ ns11 ] ) and then obtain the first order density profile from eq .",
    "( [ cont1 ] ) .",
    "we now verify the physical meaning of the dimensionless perturbation parameter associated with the low compressibility limit , as discussed above . dividing through eq .",
    "( [ ns1 ] ) by @xmath34 , introducing the average speed of sound @xmath2 via @xmath35 and introducing the dimensionless variable @xmath36 ( i.e. the dimensionless density correction ) we have : @xmath37 where we recall that the product @xmath26 must be viewed as finite .",
    "we see from this result that the dimensionless perturbation parameter associated with the correction to the density due to compressibility is indeed of order @xmath38 .",
    "proceeding in a similar way to evaluate the order of magnitude of the correction to the velocity ( @xmath39 ) due to the finite compressibility , it can be seen that the dimensionless perturbation parameter associated with the correction to velocity field ( @xmath39 ) is @xmath40 .",
    "as explained above , the equations obtained from the perturbative analysis are quite general and can be used when @xmath41 is uniform , as well as when it takes on a specific inhomogeneous form due to the application of some external force @xmath12 which need not be specified . in the case",
    "where no external force is imposed on the fluid , the zeroth order density distribution is of course a constant .",
    "this applies to the calculations performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , for an obstructed annular cylinder as explained in the introduction . in this case",
    "it is more convenient to start by simplifying the basic equations from the beginning . since @xmath42 and @xmath43 , one has for the continuity equation at first order : @xmath44 in this limit the first order euler equation eq .",
    "( [ ns1 ] ) is : @xmath45 combining the two equations above , we obtain the following equation for @xmath39 : @xmath46 with the right side known from the solution of the zeroth order equations . since one of these equations is @xmath43 , similar green function methods lead to solutions for both @xmath32 and @xmath39 . specializing to the curl free case ( absence of vortices )",
    "we introduce a scalar potential , @xmath47 , such that @xmath48 .",
    "( [ ns1u ] ) then becomes : @xmath49 which we solve by finding the appropriate green function with specified boundary conditions .",
    "once this is done we solve for @xmath39 from : @xmath50 recalling that @xmath51.the correction to the density profile due to nonzero compressibility - @xmath52 - is calculated from eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) using the result for @xmath32 obtained from solving the equation @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude this general discussion with a brief discussion of the relation of our method to the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "( [ ns0 ] ) is an equilibrium relation ( @xmath53 ) and in that respect it is analogous to neglecting the kinetic terms in the gp equation : in this sense it resembles the thomas - fermi approximation in equilibrium .",
    "corrections to the equilibrium thomas - fermi approximation have been studied previously .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite keeps terms linear in the velocity in the context of studying collective modes .",
    "this is different from our current study where , as explained in the introduction , we consider induced flows .",
    "in this section we present the results of calculations of the corrections to the velocity field ( @xmath39 ) and density ( @xmath52 ) due to finite compressibility using the perturbative method described in the section above .",
    "we study the effect of nonzero compressibility on the velocity field and density distribution of confined superfluids in two different situations . in the first case , an external force imposed on the fluid leads to an equilibrium gaussian density profile . the other case , in the @xmath54 limit , deals with the compressibility corrections for superfluid flow in an obstructed cylinder , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of an obstructed cylinder ,",
    "the fluid is driven by an obstruction and therefore the thomas - fermi approximation is not valid as the kinetic energy term can not be neglected .",
    "we consider first the case of a cylindrical sample where an external force imposed on the fluid in equilibrium results in a gaussian density profile i.e. @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the characteristic length scale associated with the density profile and @xmath57 the cylindrical radial coordinate .",
    "we assume the cylinder is long enough so that we can neglect edge effects and solve the problem as a quasi two - dimensional one .",
    "density profiles other than a gaussian can also be considered by the same method : here we focus on this case as an example . in order to calculate @xmath52 and @xmath39 we use equations ( [ cont1 ] ) and ( [ ns11 ] ) respectively , which requires us to calculate first an appropriate zeroth order velocity field @xmath32 corresponding to the incompressible limit .    to calculate @xmath32 , we use the zeroth order continuity equation ( eq .  ( [ cont0 ] ) ) with the gaussian density profile , @xmath34 , specified above . calculating @xmath58 and defining a velocity potential such that @xmath59 , eq .",
    "( [ cont0 ] ) takes the form : @xmath60 this equation has a variety of solutions reflecting the many possibilities for the velocity field . for our example",
    ", we restrict ourselves to begin with to the case where @xmath32 has no azimuthal dependence . assuming then a purely radial solution i.e. @xmath61 we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63 the solution is : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the usual exponential integral function .",
    "we obtain from this a purely radial part of @xmath66 namely : @xmath67 where the integration constant @xmath68 is a quantity with units of circulation .",
    "the increase in the velocity with @xmath57 appears strange until one recalls that the density decreases ( see eq.([prof ] ) ) exponentially so that the current decreases with @xmath57 . to this particular solution",
    "we add an azimuthal component corresponding to a vortex centered at the origin .",
    "this amounts to adding to the velocity potential a term proportional to @xmath69 , which of course also satisfies the linear eq .",
    "( [ vp ] ) .",
    "this leads to an azimuthal component : @xmath70 introducing this vortex in the fluid implies that the curl of the zeroth order velocity field , @xmath71 is non - zero .",
    "this does not contradict the definition of @xmath32 as a gradient of a velocity potential since one is dealing with a singular field .",
    "the singularity at the origin requires the imposition of a small @xmath57 cutoff . at the vortex core radius in a bose fluid ,",
    "the characteristic velocity of fluid flow is of the same order of magnitude as the sound velocity @xcite .",
    "the region near the vortex core is also characterized by faster density variations , making the quantum pressure term important . therefore , we introduce a short distance cutoff near the vortex of order few times the vortex core radius . outside this region",
    "our assumptions of small mach number squared and negligible quantum pressure term hold true .",
    "the circulation around the origin due to the azimuthal component of the velocity is @xmath72 .",
    "physically , we know that the circulation must be quantized .",
    "it follows that , as opposed to @xmath68 , @xmath73 is not a completely arbitrary constant , but must be an integer number of circulation quanta @xmath74 . to make an estimate of the order of magnitude of the effect of nonzero compressibility , we assume in our numerical work that there is one quantum of circulation .",

    "one then gets an expression for the velocity potential in the form of eq .",
    "( [ po2 ] ) , with @xmath136 given by eq .",
    "( [ gf3 ] ) and the @xmath137 evaluated from eqns .",
    "( [ vcircle ] ) and ( [ vcircle2 ] ) .",
    "taking then the gradient , the correction to the velocity field is calculated . in our subsequent calculations ,",
    "we introduce a radial cutoff , which we take to be @xmath138 , to exclude the small @xmath57 region where@xcite the zeroth order velocity has a weak square root singularity .    in principle , this procedure involves no advanced mathematical steps .",
    "however , one can readily see that it is very lengthy and intricate . since the right side of eq .",
    "( [ po2 ] ) is cubic in @xmath32 , the components of which are in the form of a series , and the green function eq .",
    "( [ gf3 ] ) involves an additional sum , the expression has the form of a quadruple sum , plus integrals over the angle @xmath139 and the radial coordinate @xmath135 .",
    "this is done analytically : the angular integrals are performed first and lead to kronecker deltas that reduce the number of sums .",
    "the radial integrals are done next and finally , the remaining ( convergent ) summations are evaluated .",
    "the resulting expression , however , is much too involved to be written here , and it would be truly very difficult even to keep track of all the terms without the help of a symbolic package ( we have used mathematica ) .",
    "the results can then be plotted and the plots are much more illuminating than the lengthy expressions .",
    "one can however see from the basic structure of the equations that overall @xmath39 is proportional to the basic velocity scale of the system , which is @xmath140 , times a factor of @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "it is rather obvious also from the equations that @xmath39 has both radial and azimuthal components .",
    "results for these components are shown in the next two figures . there , the dimensionless quantity plotted is a component of @xmath143 , divided by @xmath144 .",
    "these are shown as functions of angle and dimensionless radial distance @xmath145 .    in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we present a plot of the radial component ( @xmath146 ) in the units described above , at several fixed values of the angle @xmath69 .",
    "one can see that the radial correction to the velocity field goes to zero at @xmath147 satisfying the radial boundary condition discussed above .",
    "the magnitude of the correction to the radial velocity ( @xmath146 ) peaks at different values of @xmath145 depending on how far one is from the line of obstruction along the azimuthal direction . at @xmath148 ,",
    "the peak in the magnitude of @xmath146 occurs closer to @xmath147 than at @xmath149 where it occurs closer to the lower cut - off . at @xmath150",
    ", @xmath146 is identically zero owing to the symmetry of the problem over an angle of @xmath151 .     for an obstructed cylinder .",
    "the dimensionless quantity shown is @xmath152 , plotted versus @xmath145 at different angles @xmath69.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the corresponding azimuthal component ( @xmath153 ) is presented in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath153 is now plotted in dimensionless units at several values of the dimensionless distance @xmath145 . it can be seen that oscillations , in which one can discern traces corresponding to the @xmath154 and @xmath155 terms of the expression for @xmath156 in eq .",
    "( [ vcircle ] ) , are present in the azimuthal correction to the velocity .",
    "this arises from the cubic ( in @xmath66 ) nature of the perturbation .",
    "again , the boundary conditions at @xmath157 are satisfied with the velocity correction being zero at these values of @xmath69 .    .",
    "the dimensionless quantity shown is @xmath158 , plotted versus @xmath69 at different values of @xmath145.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    having calculated the correction to the velocity field due to finite compressibility , we can next study the correction to the density profile ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this turns out to be computationally much simpler . starting with eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) , a line integral over @xmath159 enables us to calculate @xmath52 . since the right side of eq .",
    "( [ rho1 ] ) can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar quantity , doing an integral over @xmath160 , @xmath161 enables us to calculate @xmath52 independent of the path chosen within the obstructed cylinder . using this property of @xmath162",
    ", we calculate @xmath163 from a line integral over two different paths and confirm that our result is indeed path independent .",
    "we determine the arbitrary constant associated with the integration by enforcing the condition that the total integral of @xmath52 over the relevant region be zero i.e. @xmath164 .",
    "this condition makes sense physically since the constraint imposed by the container implies that the total mass change due to the compressibility correction must be zero .     - due to finite compressibility at different values of @xmath69.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "this gives us the full function @xmath163 .",
    "because of the nonlinearities in @xmath66 present in the equations , the results , although formally analytic in terms of convergent double series , are again quite intricate and will not be written down explicitly here . instead , as before ,",
    "results are plotted in the next two figures .",
    "the quantity plotted is the dimensionless @xmath165 and we plot it at different values of @xmath69 in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "one can see that that radial dependence of the density correction is more prominent closer to the line of obstruction within the cylinder , which makes sense physically .",
    "also , it is positive or close to zero near the outer boundary , and negative at smaller values of @xmath145 .",
    "this seems to be a direct consequence of the fact that the higher the velocity of fluid flow , the lower is the condensate density @xcite .",
    "physically , the compressibility correction depletes the density at smaller values of @xmath145 and , conversely , increases it at large values .",
    "similarly , the azimuthal dependence of @xmath163 , is plotted at different values of @xmath145 in figure [ fig8 ] .     - due to finite compressibility at different values of @xmath166,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "the angular dependence of these results reflects again the nature of the perturbation .",
    "we proceed now to analyze the order of magnitude of these corrections in typical cold atomic systems . for this problem ( as opposed to the gaussian profile situation ) the values of the dimensionless quantities plotted do not exceed unity , so that the corrections are now smaller and the perturbation theory is valid for larger values of @xmath99 .",
    "our results show that compressibility corrections for fixed @xmath6 are smaller for more confined geometries . in this case",
    ", it is best to phrase the issue in terms of the validity of the theory ( or the need for it ) in the upper part of the relevant range of @xmath6 .",
    "this range of @xmath6 values is limited by the requirement that the circulation created by the zeroth order velocity does not exceed a flux quantum .",
    "the velocities involved are roughly@xcite of order @xmath167 . demanding then that this speed , times @xmath123 , be of order of one flux quantum and using the order of magnitude values discussed previously , we find that the corresponding @xmath99 for cold atomic systems may reach values up to @xmath168 .",
    "thus , we find that for these systems finite compressibility corrections are not always negligible but on the other hand they are , at least for samples that are not too small , amenable to our perturbation approach . for superfluid helium we find , as expected , that @xmath99 is much smaller and the incompressible limit calculations are perfectly adequate .",
    "in this paper , we have studied , by means of an analytic method , the hydrodynamics of compressible superfluids in confined geometries . we have shown that for practical cases of interest in cold atomic systems confined to complex geometries the corrections to the zero compressibility results are not negligible , but they can in many realistic cases be treated in a perturbative manner with the relevant dimensionless parameter being the square of the ratio of the typical speed to the sound speed ( the mach number ) .",
    "this method may be used in very general situations .",
    "we have illustrated the procedure by working out two examples . in the first , confining forces that need not be specified constrict the fluid to having a gaussian density distribution at zeroth order . in the second , we have considered the case of a rotating obstructed cylinder filled with superfluid , with the density being uniform when the cylinder is at rest . the zeroth order ( incompressible limit )",
    "solution to the problem is available@xcite and the perturbative method is used to evaluate the corrections , again essentially in an analytic way .",
    "the general usefulness of the method is therefore illustrated by these examples .",
    "the general nature of the perturbative method applied to superfluids in confined geometries makes it useful for describing the results of relevant experiments on cold atomic systems , some of which have been mentioned in the introduction .",
    "one of the main advantages of our procedure is that , since the resulting equations are linear , it is very amenable to analytic solution .",
    "we expect that this method will complement numerical calculations based on more microscopic descriptions such as the gp equation .",
    "starting directly from the hydrodynamic equations is , in the appropriate limit , a good alternative to using the full gp equations , for situations where a hydrodynamic scale flow is imposed on the system .",
