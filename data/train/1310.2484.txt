    "the bernstein  von mises ( bvm ) theorem constitutes a powerful and precise tool to study bayes procedures from a frequentist point of view .",
    "it gives universal conditions on the prior under which the posterior distribution has the approximate shape of a normal distribution .",
    "the theorem is well understood in finite - dimensional models ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , but involves some delicate conceptual and mathematical issues in the infinite - dimensional setting .",
    "there exists a donsker - type bvm theorem for the cumulative distribution function based on dirichlet process priors , see lo @xcite , and this carries over to a variety of closely related nonparametric situations , including quantile inference and censoring models , where bernstein ",
    "von mises results are available : see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the proofs of these results rely on a direct analysis of the posterior distribution , which is explicitly given in these settings ( and typically of dirichlet form ) .",
    "when considering general priors that model potentially smoother nonparametric objects such as densities or regression functions , the bvm phenomenon appears to be much less well understood .",
    "notably , freedman @xcite has shown that in a basic gaussian conjugate @xmath0-sequence space setting , the bvm theorem does not hold true in generality ; see also the related recent contributions @xcite . in contrast , in the recent paper @xcite , nonparametric bvm theorems have been proved in a topology that is weaker than the one of @xmath0 , and it was shown that such results can be useful for several nonparametric problems , including the @xmath1-setting , when applied with care .",
    "an important consequence is that , in contrast to the finite - dimensional situation , whether a nonparametric posterior credible set is a frequentist confidence set or not depends in a possibly quite subtle way on the _ geometry _ of the set .",
    "the results in @xcite are confined to the most basic nonparametric model  gaussian white noise  and",
    "strongly rely on hilbert space techniques .",
    "the main novelties of the present paper are : ( a ) extensions of the results in @xcite to the i.i.d . sampling model and ( b ) the derivation of sharp bernstein  von mises results in spaces",
    "whose geometry resembles an @xmath2-type space and whose norms are strong enough to allow one to deduce some fundamental new applications to posterior credible bands and kolmogorov  smirnov type results .",
    "our results are based on mathematical tools developed recently in bayesian nonparametrics , particularly the papers @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "these give sub - gaussian estimates on fixed ( semiparametric ) functionals of posterior distributions over well - chosen events in the support of the posterior , which in turn can be used to control the supremum - type norms relevant in our context via concentration properties of maxima of sub - gaussian variables .",
    "let us outline some applications of our results : consider a prior distribution @xmath3 on a family @xmath4 of probability densities @xmath5 , such as a random dirichlet histogram or a gaussian series prior on the log - density .",
    "let @xmath6 be the posterior distribution obtained from observing @xmath7 .",
    "it is of interest to study the induced posterior distribution on the cumulative distribution function @xmath8 of @xmath5 . making the `` frequentist '' assumption @xmath9",
    ", the stochastic fluctuations of @xmath8 around the empirical distribution function @xmath10}(x_i)$ ] under the posterior distribution will be shown to be approximately those of a @xmath11-brownian bridge @xmath12 : under the law @xmath13 of @xmath14 the distributional approximation ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 holds true , in a sense to be made fully precise below ( corollary  [ classd ] ) .",
    "this parallels lo s @xcite results for the dirichlet process and can be used to validate bayesian kolmogorov  smirnov tests and credible bands from a frequentist point of view .",
    "note , however , that unlike the results in @xcite , our techniques are not at all based on any conjugate analysis and open the door to the derivation of bernstein  von mises results in general settings of bayesian nonparametrics",
    ". we also note that ( [ donbvm ] ) is comparable to central limit theorems @xmath17 in @xmath18-probability for bootstrapped empirical measures @xmath19 ; see the classical paper @xcite .",
    "this illustrates how bvm theorems are in some sense the bayesian versions of bootstrap consistency results .",
    "our results also have important applications for inference on the more difficult functional parameter @xmath5 itself . for instance",
    ", we will show that certain @xmath20 posterior credible sets for a density or regression function are also frequentist optimal , asymptotically exact level @xmath20 confidence bands .    before we explain these applications in detail it is convenient to shed some more light on our general setting .",
    "the spaces in which we derive bvm - type results are in principle abstract and dictated by the applications we have in mind .",
    "they are , however , connected to the frequentist literature on nonparametric multiscale inference , as developed in the papers @xcite , where also many further references can be found .",
    "this connection gives a further motivation for our general setting as well as heuristics for the inference procedures we suggest here .",
    "let us thus explain some main ideas behind the multiscale approach in the simple regression framework of observing a signal in gaussian white noise @xmath21 , n \\in\\mathbb n,\\ ] ] which can also be written @xmath22 , with @xmath23 a standard white noise ; see ( [ wnmodel ] ) below for details .",
    "the i.i.d . sampling model , which will be treated below , gives rise to similar intuitions after replacing @xmath24 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the empirical measure from a sample from law @xmath27 with density  @xmath5 .",
    "one introduces a double - indexed family of linear multiscale functionals @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a scaling parameter which has @xmath30 associated location indices @xmath31 .",
    "the prototypical example that we will focus on is to take a haar wavelet @xmath32}-\\1_{(1/2,1]}$ ] , or a more general wavelet function @xmath33 generating a frame or orthonormal basis @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "the projection of @xmath24 onto the first @xmath36 scales gives rise to random variables @xmath37 and the maximum over all these statistics scaled by @xmath38 @xmath39 has a canonical distribution under the null hypothesis @xmath40 .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is often called a _ multiscale statistic _ , and the quantiles of its distribution are used to test hypotheses on @xmath5 .",
    "one can also construct confidence sets @xmath42 by simply taking @xmath42 to consist of all those @xmath5 that satisfy simultaneously all the linear constraints @xmath43 where @xmath44 are suitable constants chosen in dependence of the distribution of @xmath41 .",
    "intersecting these linear restrictions with further qualitative information about @xmath5 , such as smoothness or shape constraints , can be shown to give optimal frequentist confidence sets ( as , e.g. , in propositions  [ histocov ] and  [ histo0 ] below ) .",
    "a key challenge in the multiscale approach is of course the analysis of the distribution of the random variables @xmath41 .",
    "one approach is to re - center @xmath41 by a quantity of order @xmath45 and to use extreme value theory to obtain a gumbel approximation of the distribution of these random variables .",
    "the slow convergence rates ( as @xmath46 ) of such limit theorems are often not satisfactory ; see , for example , @xcite . instead we shall introduce certain sequence spaces in which direct gaussian asymptotics can be obtained for multiscale statistics ( without re - centring ) .",
    "this allows for faster convergence rates ( by using standard berry  esseen bounds for the central limit theorem ) .",
    "it is also naturally compatible with a bayesian approach to multiscale inference : one distributes independent random variables across the scales @xmath29 and locations @xmath31 , corresponding to a random series prior common in bayesian nonparametrics .",
    "the posterior distribution then allows one effectively to `` bootstrap '' the law of @xmath41 , and our bvm - results in multiscale spaces will give a full frequentist justification of this approach .",
    "let us illustrate the last point in a key example involving a histogram prior @xmath47 , equal to the law of the random probability density @xmath48 , i_k^l = \\bigl(k2^{-l } , ( k+1)2^{-l}\\bigr ] , k\\ge1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath49 are drawn from a @xmath50-dirichlet distribution on the unit simplex of @xmath51 .",

    ".    now we check ( [ eq - bound ] ) , in two steps .",
    "first , lemma  [ lem - lapu ] below enables us to incorporate the term @xmath520 into the likelihood coming from bayes formula applied to @xmath521 and reduces the problem to a change of measure with respect to the prior .",
    "next , this change of measure is handled below .",
    "let us now apply lemma  [ lem - lapu ] below to @xmath522 for @xmath3 , one of the considered priors .",
    "set @xmath523 .",
    "first note that @xmath524 , which is bounded by assumption for @xmath304 .",
    "next note that , for @xmath508 , @xmath525 for @xmath477 the hellinger distance we have @xmath526 valid for @xmath527 .",
    "hence on @xmath423 we have that @xmath528 .",
    "since @xmath529 , we have @xmath530 , so one can apply lemma  [ lem - lapu ] with @xmath531 and deduce @xmath532    now we are ready to change variables in the last ratio . for each of the examples of priors considered ,",
    "we show that this ratio is bounded from above by a constant as @xmath371 .",
    "we start with case ( s ) . by definition ,",
    "the quantity @xmath533 is a function of @xmath534 .",
    "next , notice that any constant in this expression vanishes due to the subtraction of the renormalising constant @xmath535 .",
    "in particular , the expression is a of @xmath536 , where @xmath537 is defined in ( [ def - t ] ) .",
    "the law of @xmath537 is induced by a finite product of probability measures , via the distributions of the coordinates of @xmath537 over @xmath538 with @xmath539 . since @xmath523 ,",
    "only one coordinate of the product measure defining @xmath537 is affected by the subtraction of @xmath540 .",
    "the next step is to change variables in the numerator of the ratio above by shifting the corresponding coordinate by @xmath541 .    for",
    ", the change in density on this coordinate can be measured by @xmath542 whose logarithm is bounded above in absolute value by @xmath543 , since by assumption , @xmath265 is lipschitz and using ( [ cond - sil ] ) combined with @xmath544 .    in case ,",
    "the prior on each coordinate is gaussian , and if @xmath545 denotes the integrating variable with respect to the coordinate @xmath546 ( corresponding to integrating out the law of @xmath547 ) in the considered ratio of integrals , we have @xmath548 recall that we work on the set @xmath423 , on which we have the following inequalities : @xmath549 , using that @xmath69 is bounded from below .",
    "moreover , note that by definition of @xmath537 , and if @xmath550 , @xmath551 , it holds @xmath552 . since @xmath553 is a constant , and @xmath225 are orthogonal to constants for @xmath554 , @xmath487 large enough , we deduce ,",
    "if @xmath555 , that on @xmath423 we have @xmath556 , as soon as @xmath554 .",
    "so , for @xmath557 , we have @xmath558 since @xmath559 belongs to @xmath560 by assumption and with ( [ cond - sil ] ) , the last term in the last display is at most a constant .",
    "we also have @xmath561 using ( [ cond - sil ] ) in the gaussian case , thus the previous display is at most a constant on @xmath423 .",
    "now we are left with the indexes such that @xmath562 . for those , by definition of the set @xmath423 , ( [ cv - gauss ] ) is in absolute value less than @xmath563 . since",
    "@xmath562 with @xmath487 fixed , the last expression is bounded , which yields ( [ eq - bound ] ) .",
    "finally , the case of the histogram prior is treated by studying the effect of the change of variables on the dirichlet distribution .",
    "the argument is similar to  @xcite , section  4.4 and is omitted .",
    "convergence of finite - dimensional distributions ( [ fidij ] ) .",
    "this can be seen to consist of establishing bvm results for the projected law of the posterior distribution on any fixed finite - dimensional subspace @xmath564 , with @xmath565 a _ finite _ admissible set of indexes . by cramr ",
    "wold , this is the same as showing a bvm for estimating the linear functional @xmath566 , with @xmath567 and @xmath568 .",
    "denote by @xmath569 the mapping , for any finite set of indices @xmath565 , @xmath570 then it is enough to show that , for any finite @xmath565 , @xmath571 as @xmath371 . since @xmath565 is finite ,",
    "the supremum - norm @xmath572 is bounded .",
    "thus the techniques of @xcite can be used for the considered priors .    in the case of histogram priors ( h )",
    ", the previous display follows from the section on random histograms in @xcite , applied to dyadic histograms .",
    "the functional @xmath573 above is linear , so the no - bias condition in @xcite amounts to check , with @xmath574}$ ] the @xmath35 projection of a given function @xmath312 in @xmath35 onto the space of regular dyadic histograms of level @xmath575 , that @xmath576})(f_0-f_{0,[k_n]})=o(1)$ ] . but @xmath577 is a dyadic histogram of fixed meshwidth , thus @xmath578}= \\psi_{{\\mathcal{t}}}$ ] for large enough  @xmath223 , since @xmath579 , so this trivially holds .",
    "finally , since @xmath579 , the variances @xmath580}-\\int \\psi_{{\\mathcal{t}},[k_n]}f_0)^2 f_0 $ ] converge to @xmath581 .    in the case of log - density priors ( s ) , one applies the general result on density estimation in @xcite ( theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "the set @xmath582 in that statement should be replaced by the set @xmath423 defined above .",
    "since @xmath423 is contained in @xmath583 and @xmath584 tends to @xmath585 in probability , the proof of that theorem goes through without further changes .",
    "it thus suffices to verify that the ratio of integrals in the former theorem from @xcite holds when the functional @xmath586 is considered .",
    "note that this is the same as proving that the ratio on the right - hand side of ( [ eq - inter ] ) goes to @xmath585 , with @xmath225 replaced by @xmath577 and now @xmath587 .",
    "since only a _",
    "finite _ number of @xmath225s are involved in the sum defining @xmath577 , the ratio involved in the change of variables tends to @xmath585 in probability : in the case of log - lipschitz densities , one uses a finite number of times the bound @xmath588 for the logarithm of ( [ eq - rat ] ) , which is of the order @xmath589 because @xmath29 is now bounded . for the gaussian density case ,",
    "one argues similarly .",
    "we conclude with the following auxiliary results : for @xmath590 these are lemmas  3 , 6 , 9 and theorems 2 , 3 in @xcite , and the case @xmath591 is proved in the same way .",
