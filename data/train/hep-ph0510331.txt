    "we know that there are two mass - squared differences separated roughly by a factor of 30 , and in the lepton mixing matrix there are two large mixing angles , and one mixing angle which has to be small . in the first part of this talk i review the present status of neutrino oscillations by reporting the results of a global analysis of latest world neutrino oscillation data from solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator experiments .",

    "the recent developments in neutrino oscillations triggered a lot of activity in the community , and many new neutrino oscillation experiments are under construction , or under active investigation , to address important open questions , such as the value of the small mixing angle @xmath0 , leptonic cp violation and the type of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "in the second part of the talk i try to give an outlook , where we could stand in about ten years from now .",
    "these results are based on a simulation of up - coming long - baseline accelerator and reactor experiments , which are expected to deliver physics results within the anticipated time scale  @xcite .",

    "already minos  will decrease significantly the error on @xmath60 . the non - trivial constraint on @xmath60 from the cngs experiments results from the fact that in this analysis also the @xmath29 disappearance channel is included for these experiments ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . for",
    "not too small values of @xmath60 t2k  will provide a determination of order 2% at @xmath59 , which corresponds roughly to an improvement of one order of magnitude with respect to the present error .",
    "however , from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : atm - prospect ] one observes that for most values of @xmath60 t2k  will improve the accuracy on @xmath22 only by a factor of 2 with respect to the present uncertainty .",
    "the main reason for this only modest improvement comes from the fact that disappearance experiments measure @xmath61 , and a small uncertainty on @xmath61 translates into a relatively large error for @xmath22 , if @xmath28 is close to maximal mixing .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lower bound on @xmath60 from no@xmath37a  is comparable to the one from t2k , however , the upper bound is significantly weaker because of a strong correlation between @xmath60 and @xmath22 . also the @xmath22 measurement of no@xmath37a",
    "is affected by this correlation , which gets resolved only in the range @xmath62  ev@xmath63 .",
    "this correlation appears because the no@xmath37a  detector is optimized for electrons , whereas the atmospheric parameters are determined essentially by the @xmath29 disappearance channel .",
    "let me add that as in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume here a low - z - calorimeter . using the totally active scintillator detector ( tasd ) as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite improves the performance of no@xmath37a  for the atmospheric parameters .     at 90   edges of the bars",
    "are obtained for the statistics limits only , whereas the right edges are obtained after successively switching on systematics , correlations , and degeneracies , _",
    "i.e. _ , they correspond to the final sensitivity .",

    "[ fig : th13 ] shows the limits which can be obtained on @xmath68 by the experiments under consideration , if no signal for a finite @xmath0 is found .",
    "one observes that the conventional beams may improve the present limit roughly by factor of 2 , d - chooz  by a factor of 4 , and the super - beams by a factor of 6 .",
    "an optimized reactor experiment could improve the present bound by more than one order of magnitude , reaching a limit for @xmath68 below @xmath69 at 90% c.l .",
    "the limits shown in fig .  [ fig : th13 ] depend on the true value of @xmath8 ; in general stronger limits can be reached for larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "the figure illustrates that the @xmath68 limits from @xmath70 appearance beam experiments are strongly affected by correlations , mainly between @xmath68 and @xmath4 .",
    "the bars labeled ` degeneracies ' originate from the fact that the hierarchy can not be determined , and the sensitivity is quoted for the hierarchy which gives the worse limit ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion of the sensitivity limit ) . clearly ,",
    "the @xmath68 limit from reactor experiments is completely free from correlations and degeneracies  @xcite , since the @xmath71 survival probability does not depend on @xmath4 and @xmath28 , and the dependence on the solar parameters is negligibly small .",

    "the black curves refer to the allowed regions for the normal mass hierarchy ( assumed to be the true hierarchy ) , whereas the gray curves refer to the @xmath76-degenerate solution ( inverted hierarchy ) , where the projections of the minima onto the @xmath68-@xmath4 plane are shown as diamonds ( normal hierarchy ) and triangles ( inverted hierarchy ) . for the latter , the @xmath77-value with respect to the best - fit point",

    "[ fig : deltatheta1 ] the allowed regions in the @xmath68-@xmath4 plane are shown assuming a true value of @xmath78 . for the super - beam experiments",
    "t2k  and no@xmath37a  one observes the strong correlation between @xmath68 and @xmath4 , which introduces a large uncertainty in @xmath68 but does not permit to draw any conclusions on @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , the reactor experiment provides an accurate measurement of @xmath68 with an accuracy at the level of 10% at 90% c.l .",
    "none of the experiments on its own can identify the mass hierarchy . as indicated in the figure , the best fit point of",
    "the wrong hierarchy is as good as the true best fit point .",
    "however , from the combination of t2k+no@xmath37a+reactor - ii  the wrong hierarchy can be disfavoured with @xmath79 , which corresponds roughly to the 90% c.l .",
    "the crucial element for the mass hierarchy determination is the long baseline of 812  km for no@xmath37a , leading to matter effects which allow to distinguish between normal and inverted hierarchy .",
    "let me add , that the hierarchy sensitivity strongly depends on the true value of @xmath4 ; typically it is optimal for @xmath80 , and worst for @xmath81  @xcite .    as visible from fig .",
    "[ fig : deltatheta1 ] no information can be obtained on cp violation , _",
    "i.e. _ , at least one of the cp - conserving values @xmath82 is contained within the 90% c.l .",
    "region , even though the assumed true value @xmath75 corresponds to maximal cp violation .",
    "the reason is that no anti - neutrino data is included in this analysis , since due to the low cross sections it seems unlikely that significant anti - neutrino data will be available within the anticipated time scale .",
    "note however , that from the combined analysis some values of @xmath4 can be excluded for a given mass hierarchy .",
    "i have reviewed the present status of neutrino oscillations from world neutrino oscillation data , including solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator experiments .",
