    "the spin chain introduced independently by haldane and shastry in 1988 is one of the most widely studied integrable lattice models with long - ranged interactions  @xcite .",
    "this chain describes @xmath2 equidistant spins on a circle , with two - body interactions inversely proportional to the square of the distance measured along the chord .",
    "the hamiltonian of the haldane  shastry ( hs ) chain can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the operator permuting the @xmath5-th and @xmath6-th spins , and the indices in the double sum range from @xmath7 to @xmath2 . if the hilbert space of each spin is @xmath8-dimensional , the operator @xmath4 can be easily expressed in terms of the @xmath9 spin operators of the @xmath5-th and @xmath6-th spins  @xcite . in particular , for spin @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the three pauli matrices acting on the @xmath14-th spin .",
    "in fact , there is also a natural @xmath15 supersymmetric version of the hs chain , which has been extensively studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the hs chain possesses remarkable physical and mathematical properties .",
    "indeed , it is intimately related to the one - dimensional hubbard model with long - range hopping , from which it is obtained in the limit of infinite on - site interaction at half filling  @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed as the simplest model providing an explicit realization of fractional statistics and anyons in one dimension  @xcite . as to its mathematical properties ,",
    "the hs chain is completely integrable  @xcite , can be solved via an asymptotic bethe ansatz  @xcite , is one of the few models invariant under the yangian group for a finite number of sites  @xcite , and its partition function can be evaluated in closed form  @xcite via polychronakos s `` freezing trick ''  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the hs chain   is essentially a limiting case of a more general model due to inozemtsev  @xcite , whose hamiltonian we shall take as @xmath16 here @xmath17 denotes the weierstrass elliptic function  @xcite with periods @xmath2 and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 . indeed , since @xmath20 ( see  [ app.limits ] ) , the @xmath21 limit of the hamiltonian   differs from   by a constant multiple of the operator @xmath22 , which trivially commutes with the hs chain hamiltonian .",
    "more surprising is the fact that when @xmath23 the inozemtsev chain is related to the heisenberg chain @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath25 we have @xmath26 ( see again  [ app.limits ] ) .",
    "interestingly , in the last decade the inozemtsev chain has also received considerable attention in the context of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "this unexpected connection stems from the work of minahan and zarembo  @xcite , who showed that at one loop the ( planar ) spectrum of the dilation operator of @xmath27 super yang ",
    "mills gauge theory can be generated by a suitable integrable spin chain with nearest - neighbor interactions . in order to generalize the latter result to more than one loop",
    ", it becomes necessary to consider integrable spin chains with long - range interactions .",
    "moreover , any such chain describing @xmath27 berenstein  maldacena  nastase theory non - perturbatively should contain an additional parameter related to the yang  mills coupling constant . as first noted by serban and staudacher  @xcite ,",
    "the inozemtsev chain   is one of the simplest models fulfilling the last two requirements .",
    "since this chain is also generally believed to be integrable , it has been extensively studied as a candidate for generating the planar spectrum of the dilation operator at several loops  @xcite",
    ". it should be noted , however , that a complete rigorous proof of the integrability of the inozemtsev chain has not yet been found , in spite of several promising partial results in this direction  @xcite . in any case , the energy spectrum of this chain is not explicitly known beyond the two - magnon sector .    in this paper",
    "we introduce an @xmath0 elliptic chain , which is in fact the simplest supersymmetric version of the inozemtsev model  .",
    "we show that , rather unexpectedly , this chain is completely integrable and its whole spectrum can be computed in closed form .",
    "our proof is based on two key ideas . in the first place",
    ", we exploit the well - known fact that the @xmath0 permutation operators can be expressed in terms of annihilation and creation operators of a single species of spinless fermions .",
    "this implies that the @xmath0 elliptic chain is equivalent to a model of hopping free fermions , which smoothly interpolates between the @xmath0 hs chain and the standard @xmath1 model ( at a critical value of the magnetic field ) .",
    "the second ingredient in our proof is the explicit computation of the dispersion relation of the @xmath0 elliptic chain using standard techniques in analytic function theory  @xcite .    from the explicit knowledge of the dispersion relation ,",
    "we have been able to study several properties of the @xmath0 elliptic chain in the thermodynamic limit . in the first place",
    ", we have analyzed the low momentum behavior of the dispersion relation , showing that the energy is quadratic in the momentum near @xmath28 for all finite values of the chain s parameter @xmath29 .",
    "thus , at low energies the @xmath0 elliptic chain behaves as a critical @xmath1 model , and in particular its low energy excitations can not be described by an effective two - dimensional conformal field theory . by contrast , it is well known that the dispersion relation of the @xmath0 hs chain is linear near the origin , and at low energies its spectrum coincides with that of a conformal field theory of @xmath8 noninteracting dirac fermions with only positive energies  @xcite .",
    "we have next computed the chain s thermodynamic functions in closed form , and determined their low temperature limit .",
    "our analysis shows that at low temperatures the @xmath0 elliptic chain behaves essentially as a critical @xmath1 model , and markedly differs from both the @xmath0 and @xmath30 hs chains .",
    "we have also studied the asymptotic behavior of the level density as the number of sites tends to infinity , proving that it approaches a gaussian distribution with parameters equal to the mean and the standard deviation of the spectrum , as is typically the case for spin chains of hs type  @xcite .",
    "finally , we have introduced the @xmath0 supersymmetric analog of inozemtsev s infinite ( hyperbolic ) chain , showing that its dispersion relation is proportional to the thermodynamic limit of the @xmath0 elliptic chain s dispersion relation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec.su11chain ]",
    "we introduce the @xmath0 elliptic chain and , as explained above , solve it by transforming it into a system of hopping fermions whose dispersion relation we compute in closed form .",
    "section  [ sec.thermo ] is devoted to the derivation of the chain s thermodynamic functions and the analysis of the asymptotic behavior of its level density .",
    "section  [ sec.infchain ] deals with the @xmath0 version of inozemtsev s infinite hyperbolic chain and its complete solution . in section  [ sec.concout ]",
    "we summarize the paper s main results , and point out several future developments suggested by our work .",
    "the paper ends with two technical appendices on the computation of several limits involving elliptic weierstrass functions , and on the proof of the properties of quasi - periodic functions needed for the evaluation of the dispersion relation of the @xmath0 elliptic chain .",
    "the model we shall study is the @xmath0 version of inozemtsev s chain  , in which each site is occupied by a spinless particle which can be either a boson or a fermion .",
    "thus the chain s hamiltonian can be written as    [ fgh ]    @xmath31 where , as before , @xmath32 and the @xmath33 are the standard @xmath0 permutation operators . more precisely , if we denote by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively the boson and the fermion states , the standard basis of the chain s hilbert space consists of the @xmath36 product states @xmath37 we then have @xmath38 where @xmath39 if @xmath40 , while @xmath41 is equal to the number of fermions occupying the sites @xmath42 if @xmath43 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively denote the boson and fermion creation operators acting on the @xmath14-th site .",
    "it is important to note that , since each site is occupied by either one boson or one fermion , the chain s hilbert space is the subspace @xmath47 of the fock space determined by the constraints @xmath48    we shall next show that a chain of the form   with _ arbitrary _ @xmath49 can be mapped to a system of @xmath2 `` hopping '' ( spinless ) free fermions .",
    "the key idea is to regard the bosonic state @xmath34 as the vacuum for the fermion .",
    "more formally , we define the operators @xmath50 and note that they satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations on @xmath47 on account of the constraints  . indeed , it is immediate to check that @xmath51 , while @xmath52={\\delta}_{ij}\\big(b_i^\\dagger b_i + f^\\dagger_if_i\\big)={\\delta}_{ij } \\quad\\text{on } { { \\mathcal h}}\\,.\\ ] ] thus @xmath53 creates a fermion at the site @xmath5 .",
    "the chain s sites can now be either empty or occupied by a fermion , and the hilbert space @xmath47 is identified with the _ whole _",
    "fock space for the new system of fermions .",
    "our next task is to express the @xmath0 permutation operator @xmath33 in terms of the fermionic operators @xmath54 . to this end ,",
    "note first of all that @xmath55 on the other hand , using the constraints   we easily obtain @xmath56 so that @xmath57 we thus have @xmath58 as first noted by haldane  @xcite . substituting   into   we easily obtain @xmath59 which is indeed the hamiltonian of a system of @xmath2 free hopping fermions .",
    "the weierstrass function @xmath60 is even and @xmath2-periodic , i.e , @xmath61 hence @xmath62 so that the model   is translation - invariant .",
    "equivalently , the chain sites can be viewed as @xmath2 equidistant points lying on a circle , as in the case of the haldane  shastry chain . when the chain   is translation - invariant , i.e. , when the function @xmath49 satisfies  , the diagonal terms in eq .   can be considerably simplified .",
    "indeed , in this case the coefficient of @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 independently of @xmath5 , so that we can write @xmath65 provided that we set @xmath66 thus a translation - invariant chain  - is equivalent to a system of @xmath2 free hopping fermions lying on a circle , with hopping amplitude between the @xmath5-th and @xmath6-th sites equal to @xmath67 .",
    "when @xmath49 satisfies eq .",
    ", the hamiltonian   can be diagonalized by performing the discrete fourier transform @xmath68 indeed , first of all it is immediate to check that the operators @xmath69 satisfy the canonical anticommutation relations , on account of the unitarity of the mapping  ; in fact , we shall show below that @xmath70 creates a fermion with momentum @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) . using the inverse fourier",
    "transform formula @xmath73 in the hamiltonian   we obtain @xmath74 with @xmath75 performing the change of index @xmath76 in the last term and using eq .",
    "we easily obtain @xmath77 with @xmath78 thus @xmath79 is indeed diagonal when written in terms of the fourier - transformed operators @xmath69 .",
    "the dispersion relation  @xmath80 can be further simplified using the definition of @xmath81 and eq .  , namely @xmath82    from the latter equation it immediately follows that @xmath83 by the first of these identities and eq .  , the degeneracy of each energy level is even , as required by the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "another immediate consequence of eq .   is the complete integrability of the model  - , since the number operators @xmath84 @xmath85 ) are a commuting family of first integrals .",
    "consider the translation operator @xmath86 , defined on the basis states by @xmath87 it is easy to check that @xmath86 is characterized by the relations @xmath88 where @xmath89 denotes the vacuum state .",
    "the momentum operator @xmath90 is defined ( up to integer multiples of @xmath91 ) in the usual way : @xmath92 it is immediate to check that when the function @xmath49 satisfies eq .   the hamiltonian   commutes with @xmath86 , and hence with @xmath90 .",
    "we shall next show that @xmath90 is also diagonalized by the fourier transform .",
    "indeed , note first of all that conditions   are equivalent to @xmath93 if we make the ansatz @xmath94 the latter conditions obviously reduce to @xmath95 the rhs is clearly equal to @xmath96 since @xmath97 .",
    "on the other hand , from the identity @xmath98 it follows that the lhs equals @xmath99 hence @xmath100 and the momentum operator @xmath90 is explicitly given by @xmath101 ( cf .",
    "thus the state created by @xmath70 has well - defined energy @xmath80 and momentum @xmath71 ( @xmath102 ) , as we had anticipated .    as we have just seen , in order to solve the elliptic chain   we need to evaluate in closed form the sum in eq .   when  @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the sum @xmath103 was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result @xmath104\\,.\\ ] ] here we have used the standard notation @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the weierstrass zeta function associated to the lattice @xmath107 , with @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( cf .",
    ". it thus suffices to compute the discrete fourier transform of the weierstrass function @xmath110 .",
    "this can be done using a technique due to inozemtsev  @xcite , which we shall briefly summarize for the reader s convenience .    for fixed @xmath111 ,",
    "we define the function @xmath112 from the periodicity of the weierstrass elliptic function , it is immediate to check that @xmath113 satisfies the quasi - periodicity conditions in eq .   with @xmath114 on the other hand , @xmath113 is clearly analytic everywhere except at points congruent to the origin , i.e. , on the lattice @xmath115 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "in fact , the only term in the sum defining @xmath113 which is singular at the origin is the one with @xmath116 . since for @xmath117 if there is a positive constant @xmath118 such that @xmath119 for @xmath120 sufficiently close to @xmath121 . ]",
    "@xmath122 the laurent series of @xmath113 about @xmath123 is simply @xmath124 and we can therefore apply eqs .   and   with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we thus have @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the weierstrass functions with half - periods @xmath10 and @xmath130 . on the other hand , from the definition of @xmath113 and eq .",
    "we easily obtain @xmath131 comparing with eq .",
    "we conclude that @xmath132 combining this formula with eq .",

    "this formula can be further simplified with the help of the homogeneity properties of the weierstrass functions , namely @xmath136 using these formulas with @xmath137 we easily arrive at the following closed - form expression for the dispersion relation of the @xmath0 elliptic chain  : @xmath138\\,,\\qquad l=1,\\dots , n-1\\,,\\ ] ] where from now on @xmath139 shall denote the weierstrass functions with periods @xmath7 and @xmath140 , and we have also set @xmath141    the reader may have noticed that eq .   coincides with the dispersion relation of the @xmath7-magnons with momentum @xmath71 ( @xmath142 ) of the @xmath30 elliptic chain   computed in ref .",
    "in fact , this remarkable relation between the @xmath30 and @xmath0 elliptic chains holds for an arbitrary translation - invariant chain of the form  .",
    "this is a further indication of the greater simplicity of the @xmath0 models compared to their @xmath30 counterparts .",
    "all the terms in the dispersion relation   depend on @xmath2 through the combination @xmath143 except for the one involving @xmath144 , which can be eliminated through the shift @xmath145 .",
