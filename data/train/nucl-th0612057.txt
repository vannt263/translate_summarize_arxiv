    "much attention has been focused on two well known problems originally revealed in the optical model analyses of the elastic scattering data for loosely bound projectiles such as @xmath1li and @xmath3be when a folding potential is used for the real part of the optical potential  @xcite .",
    "first , as demonstrated by satchler and love  @xcite , it is needed to reduce the magnitude of the folding potential by a factor @xmath4 to fit the data ; problem(1 ) .",
    "secondly , the threshold anomaly  @xcite does not appear in the resultant normalization constant @xmath5 fixed from the fit to the data at near - coulomb - barrier energies  @xcite ; problem(2 ) .",
    "it is natural to expect that these two problems may originate from the strong breakup character of the loosely bound projectiles ; in fact , studies have been made of the effects of the breakup on the elastic scattering , based on the coupled discretized continuum channel ( cdcc ) method  @xcite .",
    "these studies were very successful in reproducing the elastic scattering data without introducing an arbitrary normalization factor and further in understanding the physical origin of the factor @xmath4 needed when only one channel optical model calculations were made .",
    "the authors of refs .  @xcite projected their coupled channel equations to a single elastic channel equation and deduced the polarization potential arising from the coupling with the breakup channels .",
    "the resultant real part of the polarization potential was then found to be repulsive at the surface region around the strong absorption radius , @xmath6 .",
    "this means that the reduction of the folding potential by a factor of @xmath4 needed to be introduced when only one - channel optical model calculation is made is to effectively take into account the effects of the coupling with breakup channels .",
    "the cdcc studies , however , have not been able to solve the problem ( 2 ) mentioned above , i.e. , the fact that the normalization factor @xmath5 does not show the threshold anomaly .    to solve the problem ( 2 ) ,",
    "it was suggested some time ago  @xcite that the threshold anomaly is due to fusion : in case where fusion is the dominant part of all the reaction processes , threshold anomaly naturally manifests itself in the optical potential extracted from the fit to elastic scattering data .",
    "however , in case where breakup or direct reactions ( dr ) dominate , the energy dependence of the resultant optical potential is governed by dr and thus should be quite smooth  @xcite . in order to see the threshold anomaly in the latter case ,",
    "it is thus necessary to separate the polarization potential into fusion and dr ( breakup ) parts .",
    "the threshold anomaly will then be observed in the fusion part of the potential .    in order to test this idea ,",
    "we have thus carried out  @xcite simultaneous @xmath0 analyses of elastic scattering and fusion cross section data for the @xmath1he+@xmath7bi  @xcite , @xmath1li+@xmath2pb  @xcite , and @xmath3be+@xmath7bi  @xcite systems at near - coulomb - barrier energies in the framework of the extended optical model  @xcite that introduces two types of complex polarization potentials , the dr and fusion potentials . in such analyses , in addition to the elastic scattering cross sections @xmath8 , the measured fusion cross section @xmath9 , was taken into account together with the total experimental dr cross section , @xmath10 , if available , or the semi - experimental dr cross section , @xmath11 , if @xmath10 was not available .",
    "the dr and fusion potentials thus determined revealed some characteristic features : first of all , both potentials satisfy separately the dispersion relation  @xcite . secondly , the fusion potential is found to exhibit the threshold anomaly , as was observed for tightly bound projectiles  @xcite , but the dr potential does not show a rapid energy variation , i.e. , the threshold anomaly .",
    "thirdly , at the strong absorption radius , the magnitude of the fusion potential was found to be much smaller than that of the dr potential . as a consequence ,",
    "the resulting total polarization potential dominated by the dr potential becomes rather smooth as a function of the incident energy .",
    "this has explained the reason why the threshold anomaly is not seen in the optical potentials determined for systems involving loosely bound projectiles such as @xmath1he , @xmath1li , and @xmath3be  @xcite .    in the extended optical model analyses",
    "made so far  @xcite use was made of a rather shallow real potential for the bare potential .",
    "the aim of the present study is to carry out for the first time an extended optical model analysis of the elastic scattering and fusion cross section data for the @xmath1li+@xmath2pb system at near - coulomb - barrier energies by utilizing a folding potential as the bare potential .",
    "we shall show that the resulting real part of the dr potential becomes repulsive and that the threshold anomaly appears in the fusion potential , describing the experimental data of the fusion and elastic scattering cross sections without the two problems ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) discussed in the beginning of the introduction .    in sec .",
    "ii , we first generate @xmath11 from the elastic scattering and fusion cross section data by following the method proposed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 analyses are then carried out in sec .",
    "iii , and the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "v concludes the paper .",
    "for the purpose of determining the fusion and dr potentials separately , it is desirable to have data for the dr cross section in addition to the fusion and elastic scattering cross sections . for the @xmath1li+@xmath2pb system , however , no reliable data for the dr cross section are available , although considerable efforts have been devoted to measure the breakup and incomplete fusion cross sections  @xcite .",
    "we thus generate the so - called semi - experimental dr cross section @xmath11 , following the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our method to generate @xmath11 resorts to the empirical fact  @xcite that the total reaction cross section calculated from the optical model fit to the available elastic scattering cross section data , @xmath12 , usually agrees well with the experimental @xmath13 , in spite of the well known ambiguities in the optical potential .",
    "let us call @xmath13 generated by the optical model the semi - experimental reaction cross section @xmath14 .",
    "then , @xmath11 is generated by @xmath15 this approach seems to work even for loosely bound projectiles , as demonstrated by kolata _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the @xmath1he+@xmath7bi system .",
    "we take @xmath16 from ref .",
    "@xcite , but since the measured cross sections there somewhat fluctuates as a function of energy , we smoothed out their experimental cross sections using the wong s formula  @xcite .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we first carry out rather simple optical model @xmath0 analyses of elastic scattering data solely for the purpose of deducing @xmath14 . for these preliminary analyses",
    ", we assume the optical potential to be a sum of @xmath17 + @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath17 is the real , energy independent bare folding potential to be discussed later in iii.b , @xmath18 is an energy independent short range imaginary potential to be discussed in iii.a , and @xmath19 is a woods - saxon type complex potential with common geometrical parameters for both real and imaginary parts .",
    "the elastic scattering data are then fitted with a fixed radius parameter @xmath20 for @xmath19 , treating , however , three other parameters , the real and the imaginary strengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the diffuseness parameter @xmath23 , as adjustable .",
    "the @xmath0 fitting is done for three choices of the radius parameter ; @xmath20=1.3 , 1.4 , and 1.5 fm .",
    "these different choices of the @xmath20-value are made in order to examine the dependence of the resulting @xmath14 on the value of @xmath24 .",

    "from the discussions of our results in the previous section , we may safely conclude that within the extended optical model approach , even if use is made of the double folding potential as its bare potential , one can describe the elastic scattering and fusion cross section data simultaneously without encountering the two problems remarked at the beginning of this paper .",
    "the normalization factor needed to be introduced to the folding potential , particularly for loosely bound projectiles , in the earlier analyses  @xcite based on the conventional optical model approach can now be removed in the present extended optical model analysis , and the effects are accounted for by means of the repulsive dr potential as observed in the cdcc approach .",
    "also the threshold anomaly that could not be seen in the analyses based on the conventional optical model approach is now seen in the fusion part of the polarization potential .    in the present work",
    ", we focused our attention only to the @xmath1li+@xmath2pb system , but it is possible to carry out similar analyses to other systems .",
    "it is particularly interesting to do the analysis for the @xmath25li+@xmath2pb system , where the conventional analysis is successfully applied to explain the data .",
    "an extension of the present analysis to the @xmath25li+@xmath2pb system is now under way , and the report of the results will be made in a separated paper .",
