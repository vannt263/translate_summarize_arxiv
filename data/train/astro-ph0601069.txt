    "in optically thick regions , more than 90% of the emitted energy in a given line can be considered produced in a limited region of the circumstellar disc .",
    "this is the case of feii in be stars ( arias et al .",
    "2005 ) , but also hydrogen balmer , paschen series if their formation region has the aspect of an expanding ring . in both circumstances ,",
    "the emitted radiation can be estimated using an equivalent isothermal ring with uniform semi - height @xmath0 , whose surface density equals the radial column density . if the particle density has a distribution @xmath1 @xmath2 , the radius of the ring is then @xmath3 @xmath4[1-(r_i / r_e)^{\\beta -2}]/[1-(r_i / r_e)^{\\beta-1}]$ ] , where @xmath5 are the internal and external radii of the line forming region .",
    "the ring can be considered having expansion @xmath6 and rotation @xmath7 velocities , both represent averages of the respective velocity fields ( arias 2004 ) .",
    "the emitted flux is simply @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the aspect - angle effective emitting surface projected on the sky and @xmath11  is : @xmath12 \\\\   &   & ( { \\rm stellar\\ emission\\ absorbed\\ by\\ the\\ front\\ side } ) + \\cr   &   & ( { \\rm front\\ side\\ emission})\\\\ i^b(x , y , v - v_r ) & = & s[1-e^{-{\\tau^t(v - v_r)\\over\\mu(x , y )                   } } ] e^{-{\\tau^f(v - v_r)\\over\\mu(x , y)}}+                   s[1-e^{-{\\tau^f(v - v_r)\\over\\mu(x , y ) } } ] \\\\   &   & ( { \\rm rear\\",

    "@xmath26 depends on the nature of the line transition : collision- , photoionization- , mixed - dominated . using @xmath26",
    "as done in cidale & ringuelet ( 1989 ) we can determine the excitation temperature ( arias et al .",
    "thus , the free parameters to fit the observed emission line profiles are : @xmath35 , @xmath23 , @xmath36 , @xmath0 , @xmath22 , @xmath7 , @xmath6 and density distribution @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 @xmath39 ) .",
    "the shape of the line profiles reduce strongly the space of free parameters , mainly those of the velocity field and the ratio between @xmath23 and @xmath0 .",
    "line intensities are sensitive to @xmath40 and @xmath36 to the temperature , which in turn determines @xmath35 .",

    "the line profiles are of the _",
    "` steeple ' _ type seen frequently in feii lines .",
    "flaring discs can be treated in the same way as cylindrical ones , except that the surface density , and hence @xmath23 depends on the coordinate perpendicular to the equator ( vinicius et al . 2005 ) .",

    "the main difference in the treatment of discs with respect to that for rings is in the velocity dependence of the intrinsic absorption line profile .",
    "it has been shown by horne & marsh ( 1986 ) that for a gaussian @xmath24 the doppler width of the profile is enlarged by a  turbulent \" term due to the differential rotation in the disc towards the observer s direction .",

    "the _ ` bottle ' _ shaped profiles can be obtained also with rings . they are produced by the @xmath52 opacity dependence of the source function due to its non - local energy supply .",
