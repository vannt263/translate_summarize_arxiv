    "the strong coupling , @xmath0 , is the only free parameter of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the massless quark limit .",
    "the knowledge of its value with good precision and accuracy is of vital importance for the study of any process that involves the strong interactions  @xcite .",
    "it has , for instance , a big impact on cross - section calculations for the large hadron collider , where its uncertainty is often one of the limiting factors on the precision reached by theoretical predictions .",
    "the present world average by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite quotes an uncertainty of about @xmath5 for @xmath0 at the scale of the @xmath2-boson mass , @xmath3 .",
    "but , when one looks at the individual values that enter in the average , one realizes that the uncertainties of many of the individual measurements are dominated by errors of theoretical origin . these errors are often difficult to precisely assess , and in fact some of the individual measurements are not in good agreement with each other .",
    "a flagrant example of that is given , for instance , by comparing the lattice result obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite with the value obtained from analyses of the event - shape variable thrust in @xmath6 collisions of ref .",
    "disagreements like that question , to some extent , if the uncertainty quoted in the world average really reflects our current understanding of the value of @xmath0 . in that sense",
    "it is crucial to have an increasing corroboration of the value of @xmath0 , by extracting it from different independent quantities , and at different energy ranges , and to critically and exhaustively analyze all the theoretical errors that enter in each of the determinations . in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented a novel determination of @xmath0 , based on the comparison of lattice data for the energy between two static sources in the fundamental representation of qcd , i.e. the qcd static energy , at short distances with perturbative expressions .",
    "this extraction was possible due to recent progress both in the lattice evaluation and the perturbative computation of the static energy .",
    "it provided a competitive determination of @xmath0 , that stemmed from a perturbative calculation at three - loop order , including resummations of logarithmically enhanced terms . in this paper",
    "we present an update of the result of ref .",
    "the main new ingredients are : ( i ) we include new lattice data , with smaller lattice spacings , and reaching shorter distances , ( ii ) we use perturbative expressions that are better suited to compare with lattice data in this wider distance range , and ( iii ) we include a more detailed assessment of the different errors sources that can contribute to the uncertainty of the final result ; the discussion of the different errors sources comprises , in fact , the bulk of the present paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] we describe the lattice data we use , in particular explaining in detail the lattice systematic errors at short distances .",
    "section  [ sec : pert ] displays the perturbative expressions we employ .",
    "the bulk of the paper is contained in sec .  [ sec : asextr ] , where we explain in detail the analysis to extract @xmath0 , and discuss all the error sources that can affect our result .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] contains some discussion of our results , as well as comparison with previous related works . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we present a short summary of the main results and conclude .",
    "in this paper we use 2 + 1-flavor lattice qcd data on the static quark - antiquark energy , @xmath7 , obtained using tree - level improved gauge action and highly - improved staggered quark ( hisq ) action , procured by the hotqcd collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the strange - quark mass @xmath8 was fixed to its physical value , while the light - quark masses were chosen to be @xmath9 .",
    "these correspond to a pion mass of about @xmath10 mev in the continuum limit , which is very close to the physical value .",
    "more precisely , we use lattice qcd data corresponding to the lattice gauge couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the largest gauge coupling , @xmath13 , corresponds to lattice spacings of @xmath14  fm .",
    "one may worry about the evolution of the topological charge on such fine lattices , but , as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the monte - carlo evolution of the topological charge is acceptable even for @xmath13 .",
    "the lattice spacing was fixed using the @xmath15 scale defined as @xmath16 the values of @xmath17 for each of the above gauge couplings have been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite and are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : r1 ] .",
    "the errors on the values of @xmath17 in the table are the combined statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the details of the lattice spacing determination , including the error estimates , are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where also additional checks on the lattice spacing determination using different physical observables are performed .",
    "since we are interested in the behavior of the static energy at short distances the effect of finite volume in lattice calculations is negligible .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as we can see , the final results for @xmath18 in tabs .  [ tab : lam3l ] and  [ tab : lam3llusres ] are quite similar , as we expected from the discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : usresan ] .",
    "we take the number at three - loop plus leading ultrasoft resummation accuracy as our best and final result .",
    "the final figure for @xmath18 , which we recall is for @xmath19 light - quark flavors and uses lattice data in the 1.3  gev  -  5.1  gev energy range , is therefore @xmath20 we now convert this result to physical units by using the value @xmath21  fm , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the pion decay constant @xmath22 ( where we added the errors in quadrature on the right - hand side ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath23 where the first error corresponds to the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : resr1lambda ] ) , and the second to the value of @xmath15 , we added the two errors in quadrature on the right - hand side .",
    "this value of @xmath24 gives @xmath25 which corresponds to @xmath26 where we used the ` mathematica ` package ` rundec `  @xcite to obtain the numbers in eqs .",

    "we would like to emphasize that the actual outcome of our analyses is eq .",
    "( [ eq : reslambda ] ) .",
    "we quote @xmath27 because it has become customary for the sake of comparison with other approaches .",
    "we do not include errors associated to the truncation of the beta function to four loops in the current version of ` rundec ` .",
    "the effects of higher - order terms in the running have been estimated , and are negligible with the current accuracies , but may become relevant if the precision of @xmath28 can be eventually reliably reduced to the per mil level  @xcite . ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : resasmz ] ) constitutes the main result of the paper .",
    "this number is perfectly compatible with our previous result in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was @xmath29 , and supersedes it .",

    "note that the plot is in units of @xmath15 , but no error associated to normalization of the lattice data is shown , since that error is irrelevant when only one lattice set is used and the perturbative expression is normalized to it , as we do in this plot . for illustration , the figure also shows the lattice data before correcting it with the factors in tab .",

    "we have improved our previous extraction of @xmath0 , in ref .",
    "@xcite , from the comparison of lattice data with perturbative expressions for the static energy of a heavy quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this has been possible because a considerable amount of new lattice data at shorter distances has become available  @xcite , which has allowed us to carry out an extra number of cross checks and hence to considerably reduce the systematic errors .",
    "in particular we have been able to correct for cutoff effects in the shorter - distance points , to analyze the dependence on the fit range , and to carry out separate analyses for different lattice spacings .",
    "thus we could , for instance , discard points which are not in the perturbative regime , points which suffer from large cutoff effects and , very importantly , avoid the lattice normalization errors that dominated our previous extraction . on the other hand ,",
    "we have used improved perturbative expressions , in which not only the first renormalon is avoided , and the ultrasoft logarithms resummed , but also the soft logarithms are summed up .",
    "this appears to be necessary because the lattice data covers a relative large range of distance values now .",
    "our final result reads @xmath40 which corresponds to @xmath41 this updated result reduces the errors by roughly a factor of two with respect to our previous extraction .",
    "it displays a higher central value , which is , nevertheless , perfectly compatible with our previous result .",
    "the errors of the @xmath0 extraction presented here can in principle be reduced by just incorporating more lattice data at shorter distances , with no further modification of the perturbative expressions , which are already at the three - loop level . notice",
    "that with the lattice data available at present , there is still little sensitivity to the ultrasoft resummation , and hence we do not expect much sensitivity to the yet unknown four - loop contribution .",
    "we have also checked that there is no sensitivity to other possible non - perturbative effects , like for instance those due to gluon or quark condensates .",
    "we conclude that the method first outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , and further developed in the present paper , is not only able to produce competitive extractions of @xmath0 when confronted with realistic lattice data  @xcite , but also to consistently improve on the outcome upon the incorporation of new shorter - distance data . for the future ,",
    "to further corroborate the result obtained here , it would be important to determine @xmath1 from the static energy calculated using other lattice actions .",
