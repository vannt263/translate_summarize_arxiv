    "quantum field theory and general relativity are supremely successful theories , both having been experimentally verified to great accuracy .",
    "however , these two theories are fundamentally incompatible : general relativity is non - renormalizable as a quantum field theory .",
    "many candidate theories of quantum gravity exist in the literature , but there is as yet no consensus as to which will provide the final fundamental theory .",
    "for a recent review of the current state of play , see @xcite .",
    "quantum gravity becomes particularly important in two realms of physics : the very early universe ( prior to the planck time , @xmath0 s ) ; and in black holes , when gravitational fields are strong but quantum effects can not be ignored .",
    "there are two different approaches to uncovering the theory of quantum gravity : firstly , there is the ` top down ' method , which involves writing a theory down and then attempting to see if the theory can make any physical predictions which are testable .",
    "the second , which is the method embraced here , is the ` bottom up ' method , in which we analyze experimental data and attempt to fit the data to various phenomenological models ( for a recent review , see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this way , we may narrow down the number of models until , eventually , a single theory emerges , which is consistent with experiment .",
    "there are various ways in which quantum gravity may alter fundamental physics ; the final theory will no doubt include highly unexpected effects on basic physical principles . here",
    "we are concerned only with one such mechanism : the influence of quantum gravity on standard quantum mechanical time - evolution .    naively , one might expect that quantum gravity is beyond the reach of experimental physics , since its relevant energy scale is the planck energy , approximately @xmath1 gev .",
    "however , recent theoretical models coming from string theory suggest that the energy scale of quantum gravity may be as low as a few tev @xcite .",
    "moreover , even with more conservative estimates of the quantum gravity energy scale , comparatively low energy physics may be sensitive to quantum gravity effects , for example , through quantum - gravity induced modifications of quantum mechanics resulting in quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "in this article we are concerned with one such low - energy system : atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "this is a comparatively simple quantum system , which lends itself to an analysis of quantum decoherence effects .",
    "there is already a body of work on the theoretical modelling of quantum decoherence effects on neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "however , the only analysis of decoherence effects in experimental data relating to @xmath2 oscillations available in the literature to date is for super - kamiokande and k2k data @xcite .",
    "an initial analysis @xcite was able to put bounds on quantum decoherence effects in a simple model .",
    "subsequently , a detailed analysis of the same simple model @xcite found that quantum decoherence effects were slightly disfavoured compared with the standard oscillation scenario , but that they could not be completely ruled out .",
    "further experimental work is therefore needed , and here we shall study the sensitivity of the antares neutrino telescope @xcite to these quantum decoherence effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations . although neutrino telescopes such as antares are primarily designed for the detection and study of neutrinos of astrophysical and cosmological origin , atmospheric neutrinos form the most important background to such sources and are likely to provide the first physics results .    as well as the simple model considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , in this paper we shall study models which are more exotic than those considered previously , as they include effects such as non - conservation of energy ( within the neutrino system ) . furthermore , while these models have been studied theoretically in the literature @xcite , they have not been experimentally tested .",
    "it should be emphasized that such quantum decoherence is not the only possible effect of quantum gravity on neutrinos @xcite .",
    "for example , quantum gravity is expected to change the energy dependence of the oscillation length @xcite , and also alter the dispersion relation @xcite , leading to observable effects @xcite .",
    "we shall also briefly discuss other , non - quantum gravity , possible corrections to atmospheric neutrino oscillations and how they relate to our models here , as well as comparing our results on quantum decoherence parameters with those coming from other experimental ( i.e. non - neutrino ) systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "although our simulations are specific to antares , we anticipate that other high energy neutrino experiments such as amanda @xcite , icecube @xcite and nestor @xcite , may well be able to probe these effects .",
    "given the high energy and long path - length of atmospheric neutrinos studied by antares , this study is complementary to `` long - baseline '' neutrino oscillation experiments . as well as the analysis of k2k data @xcite ,",
    "a related analysis of kamland data has also been performed in @xcite . in both cases",
    "decoherence is disfavoured over the standard oscillation picture .",
    "the potential for bounding quantum decoherence and other damping signatures in future reactor experiments , such as minos @xcite and opera @xcite , is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : qg ] , we discuss how quantum gravity may be expected to modify quantum mechanics , before applying the formalism developed to atmospheric neutrino oscillations in section [ sec : atmqg ] .",
    "we study in detail some specific models of quantum decoherence in section [ sec : sensitivity ] , and describe the results of antares sensitivity simulations for these models in section [ sec : oscfit ] .",
    "the projected antares sensitivities are compared with results from other experiments ( both neutrino and non - neutrino ) in section [ sec : exp ] , and we briefly discuss other possible corrections to atmospheric neutrino oscillations in section [ sec : other ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use units in which @xmath3 .",
    "in quantum gravity , space - time is expected to adopt a ` foamy ' structure @xcite : tiny black holes form out of the vacuum ( in the same way that quantum particles can be formed out of the vacuum ) .",
    "these will be very short - lived , evaporating quickly by hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "each microscopic black hole may induce variations in the standard time - evolution of quantum mechanics , as an initially pure quantum state ( describing the space - time before the formation of the black hole ) can evolve to a mixed quantum state ( describing the hawking radiation left after the black hole has evaporated ) .",
    "in particular , in quantum gravity it is no longer necessarily the case that pure states can not evolve to mixed states .    in order to describe this process ,",
    "hawking suggested a quantum gravitational modification of quantum mechanics @xcite , which is based on the density matrix formalism .",
    "an initial quantum state is described by a density matrix @xmath4 , and this state then evolves to a final state described by a density matrix @xmath5 .",
    "the two density matrices are related by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an operator known as the _ super - scattering _ operator . in ordinary quantum mechanics",
    ", the super - scattering operator can be factorized as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the usual @xmath10-matrix . in this case",
    ", a pure initial state always leads to a pure final state .",
    "however , in quantum gravity it is no longer necessarily the case that the super - scattering matrix can be factorized as in equation ( [ scat : fac ] ) , and , if it can not , then the evolution from pure state to mixed state is allowed .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is that it requires the construction of asymptotic `` in '' and `` out '' states .",
    "therefore , here we will take an alternative approach , which is more useful for our application to atmospheric neutrino oscillations , allowing the evolution of pure to mixed states by modifying the differential equation describing the time - evolution of the density matrix @xmath11 @xcite . in standard quantum mechanics",
    "this differential equation takes the form @xmath12,\\ ] ] and could be modified by quantum gravity to the equation @xcite @xmath12+\\delta\\!\\!\\,\\!\\!\\slash h\\rho .",
    "\\label{dens : matnp}\\ ] ] in the above equations , @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath14 is the most general linear extension which maps hermitian matrices to hermitian matrices and the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time .",
    "various conditions need to be imposed on @xmath14 to ensure that probability is still conserved and that @xmath15 is never greater than unity @xcite .",
    "these conditions will be implemented in the next section when we apply this approach to atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "however , the precise form of @xmath14 would need to come from a complete , final , theory of quantum gravity . in this paper",
    "we take a phenomenological approach , modelling @xmath14 in a manner independent of its origin in quantum gravity .",
    "ultimately one may hope that experimental observations may be able to constrain the form of @xmath14 and hence its theoretical origin .",
    "one form of @xmath14 which is frequently employed in the literature is the lindblad form  @xcite @xmath16 \\right ] , \\label{eq : lindblad}\\ ] ] where the @xmath17 are self - adjoint operators which commute with the hamiltonian of the theory .",
    "such modifications of standard quantum - mechanical time evolution have been widely studied , both as a solution to the quantum measurement problem @xcite and for decoherence due to the interaction with an environment @xcite . in recent work in discrete quantum gravity , it has been shown that @xmath14 has the lindblad form with a single operator @xmath18 which is proportional to the hamiltonian @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that this is not the only possible approach to quantum gravity , and that other formulations indicate that in general @xmath19 does not have the lindblad form .",
    "this is the reason for our more general set - up in this paper .",
    "modifications of quantum mechanics ( whether from quantum gravity or other origins ) of the form ( [ dens : matnp ] ) are often known as _ quantum decoherence _ effects as they emerge from dissipative interactions with an environment ( of which space - time foam is just one example ) , and allow transitions from pure to mixed quantum states ( i.e. a loss of _ coherence _ ) .",
    "such effects have been studied in quantum systems other than atmospheric neutrinos , for example , the neutral kaon system , for which there exists an extensive literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that although our primary motivation for studying quantum decoherence is from quantum gravity , in fact our modelling in the subsequent sections is independent of the source of the quantum decoherence .",
    "furthermore , ohlsson @xcite has discussed how gaussian uncertainties in the neutrino energy and path length , when averaged over , can lead to modifications of the standard neutrino oscillation probability which are similar in form to those coming from quantum decoherence , and which are therefore included in our analysis .",
    "see also @xcite for further discussion of these effects .",
    "we now consider how quantum gravity induced modifications of quantum mechanics , as outlined in the previous section , may affect atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the quantum system of interest is then simply made up of muon and tau neutrinos .",
    "the mathematical modelling of quantum decoherence effects in this system is not dissimilar to that for the neutral kaon system @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will assume that quantum decoherece affects neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the same way , and do not consider the possibility that quantum decoherence may appear only in the anti - neutrino sector @xcite .    in order to implement equation ( [ dens : matnp ] ) for the system of atmospheric muon and tau neutrinos",
    ", we need to represent the matrices @xmath13 and @xmath20 in terms of a specific basis which comprises the standard pauli matrices @xmath21 .",
    "we may , therefore , write the density matrix , hamiltonian and additional term @xmath19 in terms of the pauli matrices as @xmath22 where the greek indices run from 0 to 3 , and a summation over repeated indices is understood . similarly decomposing the time derivative of the density matrix ,",
    "@xmath23 where , using equation ( [ dens : matnp ] ) : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 represents the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations and @xmath26 the quantum decoherence effects . in order to preserve unitarity ,",
    "the first row and column of the matrix @xmath26 must vanish ; the fact that @xmath15 can never exceed unity means that @xmath26 must be negative semi - definite @xcite .",
    "the most general form of @xmath26 is therefore given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are real constants parameterizing the quantum decoherence effects .    particularly with regard to quantum decoherence induced by space - time foam ( see section [ sec : qg ] ) , it is not clear exactly what assumptions about the time - evolution matrix @xmath26 are reasonable , for example , it may no longer be the case that energy is conserved within the neutrino system , as energy may be lost to the environment of space - time foam .",
    "the first observation is that @xmath26 has non - zero entries in the final row and column ( @xmath30 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , which correspond to terms which violate energy conservation @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath26 can be further simplified by making additional assumptions .",
    "for example , since the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath11 correspond to probabilities , we require that these are positive ( this is known as _ simple positivity _ ) .",
    "however , we can make a much stronger assumption known as _ complete positivity _ , discussed in @xcite .",
    "it arises in the quantum mechanics of open systems , and ensures the positivity of the density matrix describing a much larger system , in which the neutrinos are coupled to an external system .",
    "complete positivity is a strong assumption , favoured by mathematicians because it is a powerful tool in proving theorems related to quantum decoherence . for the matrix @xmath26 , assuming complete positivity leads to a number of inequalities on the quantum decoherence parameters @xcite , and assuming both complete positivity and energy conservation within the neutrino system means that @xmath36 and all other quantum decoherence parameters must vanish @xcite ( which gives the lindblad form ( [ eq : lindblad ] ) ) .",
    "it is this simplified model which has been most studied in the literature to date @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we wish to consider not only this simplified model but other more general models of quantum decoherence which do not necessarily satisfy complete positivity or energy conservation .",
    "substituting ( [ eq : hprime ] ) into ( [ eq : dotrho ] ) , and incorporating the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the matrix @xmath25 ( [ eq : dotrho ] ) , we obtain the following differential equations for the time - evolution of the components of the density matrix : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the usual difference in squared masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates , and @xmath39 is the neutrino energy .    by integrating the differential equations ( [ diffeqn : rho ] ) with suitable initial conditions , the probability for a muon neutrino to oscillate into a tau neutrino can be calculated . in general , this probability has the form  @xcite : @xmath40   &   = & \\frac { 1}{2 } \\left\\{1-\\cos^{2}(2\\theta )   m_{33}(e , l)-\\sin^{2}(2\\theta ) m_{11}(e , l ) \\right .",

    "we shall study various special cases in which there will be closed form functions of the new parameters appearing in the probability ( [ eq : genprob ] ) . for each model , we consider three possible ways in which the quantum decoherence parameters can depend on the energy @xmath39 of the neutrinos ( we shall assume that where there are two or more quantum decoherence parameters , they have the same energy dependence ) :    1 .",
    "firstly , the simplest model is to suppose that the quantum decoherence parameters are constants , and have no energy dependence . in this case",
    "we write @xmath48 with similar expressions for the other quantum decoherence parameters . 2 .",
    "secondly , we consider the situation in which the quantum decoherence parameters are inversely proportional to the energy @xmath39 , which leads to probabilities which are lorentz invariant .",
    "we define the constants of proportionality @xmath49 etc . according to the equation : @xmath50 this energy dependence has received the most attention to date in the literature @xcite",
    ". we should comment that lorentz invariance is not necessarily expected to hold exactly in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "3 .   finally , we study a model suggested in reference @xcite , and which arises in some semi - classical calculations of decoherence phenomena in black hole and recoiling d - brane geometries @xcite , namely that the quantum decoherence parameters are proportional to the energy squared , so that the quantum decoherence parameters are given by expressions of the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a constant .",
    "this energy dependence also arises from discrete quantum gravity @xcite , where the operator @xmath18 in the lindblad form ( [ eq : lindblad ] ) is proportional to the hamiltonian . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath53 contains a factor of @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the planck mass , @xmath56 ev .",
    "this suppression of quantum gravity effects by a single power of the planck mass is naively unexpected ( as it corresponds to a dimension-5 , non - renormalizable operator in the theory , see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "one would instead expect quantum gravity effects to be suppressed by the planck mass squared .    we should also point out that an alternative energy dependence , namely that quantum decoherence parameters are proportional to @xmath57 has been suggested from @xmath18-brane interactions in non - critical string theory @xcite .",
    "however , we have not been able to derive any meaningful results for this energy dependence , in accordance with the observation in @xcite that it is unlikely that current , or even planned , experiments will be able to probe this energy dependence .    to see how quantum decoherence affects atmospheric neutrino oscillations",
    ", we now compare the oscillation probabilities .",
    "although the oscillation probabilities are unobservable directly , they nonetheless provide insight into the underlying physics behind observable neutrino behaviour .",
    "firstly , the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillation probability is given by @xmath58 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ 1-\\cos \\left ( 6.604\\times 10^{-3}\\frac { l}{e}\\right ) \\right ] ; \\label{eq : standard}\\ ] ] where we have restored the constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 and the neutrino energy @xmath39 is measured in gev with the path length @xmath61 being measured in km . in equation ( [ eq : standard ] ) , we have taken @xmath38 and @xmath62 to have their best - fit values @xcite @xmath63 the oscillation probability ( [ eq : standard ] ) is plotted in figure [ fig : standard1 ] as a function of path length @xmath61 , for fixed neutrino energy @xmath39 equal to 1 gev and 200 gev , and in figure [ fig : standard2 ] as a function of neutrino energy @xmath39 for fixed path length @xmath61 equal to 10000 km .    ) as a function of path length @xmath61 ( measured in km ) , for fixed neutrino energy @xmath39 equal to 1 gev ( top ) and 200 gev ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] + ) as a function of path length @xmath61 ( measured in km ) , for fixed neutrino energy @xmath39 equal to 1 gev ( top ) and 200 gev ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    ) as a function of neutrino energy @xmath39 ( measured in gev ) , for fixed path length equal to 10000 km.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    although atmospheric neutrino experiments to date have tended to focus on neutrino energies of the order of a few gev @xcite , antares is sensitive to high energy neutrinos ( above the order of tens of gev ) .",

    "further discussion of the atmospheric neutrino flux at high energies , see , for example , references @xcite .",
    "since antares detects neutrinos which have passed through the earth , we have chosen our reference path length to be a similar order of magnitude to the radius of the earth .",
    "we now plot the corresponding probabilities including quantum decoherence effects , the general oscillation probability being given by equation ( [ eq : genprob ] ) . for illustration purposes , we take values of the quantum decoherence parameters equal to the upper bounds of the sensitivity regions found in table [ table : gammukap ] in section [ sec : exp ] , except that we take @xmath64 as these parameters have a negligible effect on the probability .    consider firstly the case in which the quantum decoherence parameters do not depend on the neutrino energy , and with the values of the decoherence parameters taken from table [ table : gammukap ] , the oscillation probability is : @xmath65 &   = & \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{-2 cm } \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { 1 - e^{-4.75\\times10^{-4}l } \\cos\\left [ 2l\\left(\\frac{1.09\\times10^{-5}}{e^{2}}-2.723\\times10^{-12}\\right ) ^{\\frac { 1}{2 } } \\right ] \\right\\}. \\label{eq : probgamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this probability ( [ eq : probgamma ] ) is plotted in figure [ fig : gamma1 ] as a function of path length @xmath61 for two fixed values of neutrino energy @xmath39 ( the same as those in figure [ fig : standard1 ] ) , and in figure [ fig : gamma2 ] as a function of energy @xmath39 for a fixed value of path length @xmath61 ( again , the same as in figure [ fig : standard2 ] ) .    ) , including quantum decoherence parameters which are independent of the neutrino energy , plotted as a function of path length @xmath61 ( measured in km ) , for fixed neutrino energy @xmath39 equal to 1 gev ( top ) and 200 gev ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] + ) , including quantum decoherence parameters which are independent of the neutrino energy , plotted as a function of path length @xmath61 ( measured in km ) , for fixed neutrino energy @xmath39 equal to 1 gev ( top ) and 200 gev ( bottom).,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    ) , including quantum decoherence parameters which are independent of the neutrino energy , plotted as a function of neutrino energy @xmath39 ( measured in gev ) , for fixed path length equal to 10000 km.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the graphs in figures [ fig : gamma1 ] and [ fig : gamma2 ] should be compared with those in figures [ fig : standard1 ] and [ fig : standard2 ] respectively .",
    "the effect of the quantum decoherence can be clearly seen . at low energy ( @xmath66 gev ) , the standard oscillations are damped by quantum decoherence until the oscillation probability converges to one half ( corresponding to complete decoherence ) at a path length of about @xmath67 km .",
    "however , at high energy ( @xmath68 gev ) , the difference caused by quantum decoherence is highly marked ( note the different vertical scales in the graphs in figures [ fig : standard1 ] and [ fig : gamma1 ] ) , with a large enhancement of the oscillation probability .",

    "further details of the antares detector , detector simulation and event signals can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we summarize the main features of the simulations which are pertinent to our discussion .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos events were generated using monte - carlo production .",
    "a spectrum proportional to @xmath107 for the neutrinos was assumed , for energies in the range 10 gev @xmath108 100 tev .",
    "the zenith angle distribution is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "twenty - five years of data were simulated , so that errors from the mc statistics could safely be ignored .",
    "event weights were used to adapt the mc flux to a real atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "we used the bartol theoretical flux @xcite , although the results will not be significantly changed by using different theoretical fluxes .",
    "there may be a more significant change in our results if the spectral index is modified .",
    "our simulations are based on three years data taking with antares .",
    "this corresponds to roughly 10000 atmospheric neutrino events .",
    "all errors are purely statistical , with simple gaussian errors assumed . by varying the form of the oscillation probability to include quantum decoherence effects , spectra in either @xmath39 , @xmath109 or @xmath61",
    "are produced .",
    "some examples of these are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "since antares is particularly sensitive to the zenith angle @xmath110 and thereby the path length @xmath61 , the spectra in @xmath111 are used in the sensitivity analysis .    to produce sensitivity regions",
    ", we used a @xmath112 technique , comparing the @xmath112 for oscillations with decoherence ( or decoherence alone ) with that for the no - oscillation hypothesis .",
    "the total normalization is left as a free parameter in the sensitivity analysis , so that our results in section [ sec : regions ] are not affected by the normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "the sensitivity regions at both 90 and 99% confidence level are produced .",
    "even though our analysis is independent of the normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux , in order to produce spectra based on numbers of events , as in the following subsection , some normalization of the total flux is necessary . for standard oscillations without quantum decoherence ,",
    "bins with high @xmath111 can be used to normalize the flux as standard oscillations are negligible at sufficiently high @xmath109 ( as can be seen in figure [ fig : standard1 ] ) .",
    "this method can also be applied for quantum decoherence models in which the decoherence parameters are inversely proportional to the neutrino energy , so that decoherence also becomes negligible at high energy . however , when the decoherence parameters are proportional to the neutrino energy squared , decoherence is significant at high energies but negligible at low @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , in this latter case , we may use the low @xmath111 bins to normalize the flux .",
    "we have studied six different models of quantum decoherence , as outlined in the previous section , and for each model there are three different ways in which the quantum decoherence parameters may depend on the neutrino energy .",
    "we shall not discuss the details of all eighteen of our simulations , but instead summarize our results and discuss a few models in more detail to illustrate the essential features . in our simulations , for practical reasons , we had at most three varying parameters , one of which was always the mixing angle @xmath79 which facilitated comparisons with previous work @xcite . in models with only one non - zero decoherence parameter ( namely models 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 above ) we also varied @xmath38 , to check that our sensitivity regions included the current best - fit values @xcite . in models with two non - zero decoherence parameters ( models 2 and 4 ) , we fixed @xmath113 ev@xmath114 .",
    "the simulations then give us a three - dimensional region of sensitivity at 90 and 99 percent confidence level , and we plotted the boundaries of the projections of the surface bounding this volume onto the co - ordinate planes , where necessary also plotting the surface itself .      as well as data based on total numbers of events ,",
    "the spectra of these events in ( typically ) @xmath109 is also important in neutrino oscillation physics . for atmospheric neutrinos ,",

    "the overall normalization of the flux , required to produce these spectra , can be found using either the high or low @xmath111 bins , depending on the situation , as described in the previous subsection .",

    "it can be seen that in both cases quantum decoherence results in a significant reduction in the number of events . however , there is also a difference in the shape of the spectra . in both models ,",
    "when the decoherence parameters are comparatively large , the spectrum in the ratio of the number of events ( lower plots ) is much flatter in the region below about 150 gev , compared with standard oscillations ( when there is a ` dip ' in the ratio of the number of events ) . for the case in which the decoherence parameters are inversely proportional to the neutrino energy , the ratio of the number of events rises to one at very high energies , but more slowly than the case of oscillations only .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the values of the parameter @xmath115 for which this is most noticeable in figure [ fig : spectra1 ] are larger than the current best upper bound from sk and k2k data @xcite . when the decoherence parameters are proportional to the neutrino energy squared ( figure [ fig : spectra2 ] ) , the spectrum of the ratio of the number of events is extremely flat .",
    "we can also consider the situation in which there are no standard oscillations , in other words , the squared mass difference @xmath38 is zero . in this case ,",
    "neutrino oscillations would be described entirely by decoherence . in this case the ratios of the numbers of events compared with the no - oscillation hypothesis are shown in figure [ fig : spectra3 ] , for decoherence parameters inversely proportional to the neutrino energy ( upper plot ) and proportional to the neutrino energy squared ( lower plot ) .    .",

    "the difference in the spectra at @xmath111 below about 150 gev is clear for the case when the decoherence parameters are proportional to the neutrino energy squared , with the decoherence - only model generally producing a peak in the spectrum where standard oscillations without decoherence has a dip .",
    "when the decoherence parameters are inversely proportional to the neutrino energy , the spectra look more like those for standard oscillations plus decoherence ( figure [ fig : spectra1 ] ) , except for small values of @xmath115 , when the spectrum is flatter than for standard oscillations only .",
    "it should be emphasised that the values of the quantum decoherence parameter @xmath53 used to generate the spectra in figures [ fig : spectra2 ] and [ fig : spectra3 ] are many orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental upper bound of @xmath116 ev@xmath117 @xcite .",
    "as the decoherence parameter @xmath53 increases , the number of events decreases and so it is clear from figures [ fig : spectra2 ] and [ fig : spectra3 ] that antares will be able to rule out even very small values of @xmath53 .",
    "this can be understood from the oscillation probabilities as shown in the figures in section [ sec : atmqg ] . for high energy neutrinos ,",
    "the standard oscillation probability is negligible and so the number of events depends only on the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
    "however , with quantum decoherence , the oscillation probability becomes close to one - half for atmospheric neutrinos and so a large fraction of the incoming muon neutrinos will oscillate , resulting in a significant decrease in the number of events seen .",
    "for low energy neutrinos , as observed by current atmospheric neutrino experiments , in the model we have concentrated on in this subsection , the effects of quantum decoherence are negligible with these values of the quantum decoherence parameters because the effects are proportional to the neutrino energy squared .",
    "this is the main result of our paper : antares measures high - energy neutrinos and so will be able to put stringent bounds on quantum decoherence effects which are proportional to the neutrino energy squared .",

    "we discuss the simplest model in some detail as it reveals most of the salient features .",
    "the remaining models are summarized briefly .",
    "we are particularly interested in the upper bounds on the sensitivity regions .",

    "this is the model in which @xmath118 and has been studied for super - kamiokande and k2k data @xcite .",
    "they found the best fit to the data when the quantum decoherence parameter is inversely proportional to the neutrino energy @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis @xcite of this case then found that the favoured situation was standard oscillations without decoherence , but that the data could not entirely rule out oscillations due to quantum decoherence only .",

    "firstly , for ease of comparison , we restate , in table [ table : gammukap ] , the upper bounds of the constants of proportionality @xmath159 , @xmath115 and @xmath53 for each of the quantum decoherence parameters , changing the units to gev for ease of comparison with other references .",
    "upper bounds have been placed on the decoherence parameters @xcite by examining data from the super - kamiokande and k2k experiments .",
    "we note than the bounds for the @xmath160 model ( @xmath161 gev ) are entirely consistent with those found in our simulations , the bounds for the @xmath162 model ( @xmath163 gev@xmath114 ) are slightly better than the antares bounds whereas the bounds found for the @xmath164 model ( @xmath165 gev@xmath144 ) are much worse than our bounds .",
    "the antares bounds are found with high energy neutrinos whereas super - kamiokande detects lower energy neutrinos and so we see that experiments which are more sensitive to lower energy neutrinos are better probes of the @xmath162 model whilst those with sensitivity to higher energy neutrinos are much better at placing bounds on the quantum gravity parameters using the @xmath164 model . for each quantum decoherence parameter , our upper bounds on the constant @xmath53",
    "are particularly strong , and , given that @xmath53 contains one inverse power of the planck mass ( @xmath166 gev ) , are close to ruling out such effects .",
    "the neutrino system is not the only quantum system which may be affected by interactions with space - time foam .",
    "experiments such as cplear @xcite have examined this problem with neutral kaons , and found the upper bounds on the quantum decoherence parameters to be @xcite @xmath167 a second analysis of this experiment took place in reference @xcite with six quantum decoherence parameters .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite were able to put bounds all the parameters and they found upper bounds on the quantum decoherence parameters to be of order @xmath168 gev .",
    "it is difficult to directly compare our results with these bounds due to the dependence on the neutrino energy in some of our models .",
    "however , when the quantum decoherence parameters are constants , our upper bounds on @xmath159 from table [ table : gammukap ] lead to upper bounds on the decoherence parameters themselves of @xmath169 and so , it seems that the antares experiment will be able to improve the upper bounds of these parameters with respect to the cplear experiment .",
    "quantum decoherence has also been explored using neutron interferometry experiments , as suggested in @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , upper bounds on the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath31 were found using data from such an experiment : @xmath170 once again , our upper bounds are tighter than these values .",
    "it is interesting to note that in both the kaon and neutron experiments , the quantum decoherence parameter @xmath171 whereas in the neutrino system , we find @xmath172 .",
    "this variation arises from the different mixing in these systems .",
    "the other difference between the meson and neutrino experiments is the possibility of different decoherence effects in the anti - neutrino sector as compared with the neutrino sector @xcite , although we have not considered this possibility further in this paper .",
    "quantum decoherence is not the only process which may modify the standard oscillation probability ( [ eq : standard ] ) for atmospheric neutrinos . in this section",
    "we briefly discuss some of the other possible phenomena , indicating how they change the oscillation probability .",
    "we will then compare these effects with those coming from quantum decoherence .",
    "the derivations of the oscillation probabilities have all been done within the framework of standard quantum mechanics .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that approaching this problem from a quantum field theory ( qft ) standpoint could alter the phenomenology @xcite .",
    "this approach yields statistical averages , but if we interpret these as probabilities , then there will be a modification of the standard oscillation probability .",
    "however , the magnitude of the correction is several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the corrections due to quantum decoherence that we are probing here .",
    "there are other new physics effects which may alter the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillation probability , not just quantum decoherence .",
    "for example , it has been suggested that our universe may have more than the @xmath173 dimensions we observe and that some of these extra dimensions may be large ( see @xcite for an introduction ) , which implies that we live on a four dimensional hyper - surface , a brane , embedded in a higher dimensional bulk . adding large extra dimensions gives rise to the possibility that some particles may propagate off our brane through the bulk and",
    "it has been suggested that one of these particles may be a sterile neutrino into which the three familiar neutrinos could oscillate .",
    "if we consider the mixing between the three standard neutrinos and the sterile neutrino to simply be an extension of the three neutrino system to a four neutrino system , and assuming that @xmath174 , then the probability a muon neutrino oscillates into a tau neutrino is @xmath175 & = & 4u_{\\mu 3}u_{\\tau 3}(u_{\\mu 3}u_{\\tau 3}+u_{\\mu 4}u_{\\tau 4})\\sin^{2}\\left[\\frac{\\delta m^{2}_{32}}{4e}l\\right]\\\\ & & + 4u_{\\mu 4}^{2}u_{\\tau 4}^{2}\\sin^{2}\\left[\\frac{\\delta m^{2}_{43}}{4e}l\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the probability has an extra term as we now have two large mass differences .",
    "however , the quantities @xmath176 are constants , independent of @xmath39 and @xmath61 and hence , this simple model gives rise to different types of terms than those found in equation ( [ eq : genprob ] ) .",
    "similar corrections to the two - neutrino oscillation probability also arise if we consider normal three - neutrino oscillations , but in this case the corrections are very small .",
    "it has , however , also been suggested that the sterile neutrino may not mix in the standard way and that the the oscillation probability is instead @xcite : @xmath177 & = & 4u_{a3}^{2}u_{b3}^{2}e^{-\\frac{\\pi^{2}\\xi_{3}^{2}}{2}}\\sin^{2 } \\left[\\frac{\\delta m_{32}^{2}}{4e}l\\right]\\\\ \\nonumber & & + 2\\sum_{l=1}^{3}u_{a3}u_{b3}u_{al}u_{bl}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } u_{0n}^{2}\\cos\\left[\\frac{(\\lambda_{n}^{2}-\\xi_{ll}^{2})l}{2er^{2}}\\right]\\\\ & & + u_{a3}^{2}u_{b3}^{2}\\left| \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}u_{0n}^{2}e^\\frac{-i\\lambda_{n}^{2}}{2er^{2}}l\\right|^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 is the size of the extra dimensions , @xmath179 are assumed to be small , @xmath180 if @xmath181 or @xmath182 if @xmath183 and the @xmath184 s are constants .",
    "this oscillation probability has a different form to that in equation ( [ eq : genprob ] ) as the exponential term multiplies the @xmath185 $ ] as opposed to the @xmath97 term . also , if we assume that @xmath178 does not change with time , then the exponential term in equation ( [ eqn : ledprob ] ) is a constant whereas the exponential term in equation ( [ eq : genprob ] ) is a function of @xmath39 and @xmath61 .    another way in which quantum gravity is expected to modify neutrino physics is through violations of lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "as with non - standard sterile neutrinos , this leads to modifications of the oscillation probability which have a different form from those due to quantum decoherence .",
    "we will examine in a separate publication the precise nature of these effects on atmospheric neutrino oscillations and whether these can be probed by antares .",
    "other types of lorentz - invariance and cpt - violating effects ( also known as `` standard model extensions '' ( smes ) ) have been studied by kostelecky and mewes @xcite , and again we shall return to these for antares in the future .",
    "one side - effect of smes is that , even for atmospheric neutrinos , matter interactions can become significant .",
    "however , it has been shown that these can safely be ignored for neutrino energies above the scale of tens of gev @xcite , which is the energy range of interest to us here .",
    "finally , more conventional physics may have an effect on atmospheric neutrino oscillations as measured by a neutrino telescope .",
    "for example , uncertainties in the energy and path length of the neutrinos may lead to modifications of the oscillation probability which are similar in form to those arising from quantum decoherence @xcite and interactions in the earth may also be a factor .",
    "however , both these effects decrease as the neutrino energy increases , whereas our strongest results are for quantum decoherence effects which increase with neutrino energy .",
    "in the absence of a complete theory of quantum gravity , phenomenological signatures of new physics are useful for experimental searches . in this article",
    "we have examined one expected effect of quantum gravity : quantum decoherence .",
    "we have considered a general model of decoherence applied to atmospheric neutrinos , and simulated the sensitivity of the antares neutrino telescope to the decoherence parameters in our model .",
    "we find that high - energy atmospheric neutrinos are able to place very strict constraints on quantum decoherence when the decoherence parameters are proportional to the neutrino energy squared , even though such effects are suppressed by at least one power of the planck mass .",
    "it should be stressed that although our results here are for the antares experiment , we expect that other high - energy neutrino experiments ( such as icecube and amanda ) should also be able to probe these models .",
