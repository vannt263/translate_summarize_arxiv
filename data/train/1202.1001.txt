    "these ratcheting molecules are too big ( in our model they are actually infinitesimally small but one can imagine that binding of the molecules leads to a deformation of the protein at the ratcheting sites ) to pass through the nanopore and prevent the protein from diffusing outside the er , i.e.  the protein performs a reflected diffusion with jumping reflection boundary which is due to binding of new ratcheting molecules . in the last two decades such models have been studied extensively in biology , physics as well as in mathematics . for a detailed overview of the recent literature and for more biological motivation",
