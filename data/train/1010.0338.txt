    "in spite of the enormous progress the field of grand unified theories ( guts ) experienced since the seminal works of georgi and glashow @xcite it is still not clear whether the basic scheme is by any means reflected by nature .",
    "nevertheless , the inherent testability of the simplest gut scenarios makes the idea of a unified description of the strong and electroweak interactions so popular that there has been a lot of efforts spent recently in attempts to pin down the simplest potentially viable scenarios , in particular those based on the @xmath5 @xcite and/or @xmath4 @xcite gauge symmetry .",
    "apart from the canonical test imposed by the required high - energy convergence of all three standard model ( sm ) gauge couplings , a successful candidate should obey also the constraints inflicted by the proton longevity ( stretching over @xmath6 years ) and the absolute neutrino mass scale , which are indeed closely related to the generic need for a compatibility with the observed sm flavour structure .",
    "however , the situation is not very clear at the moment as even the very concept of minimality admits a certain number of interpretations .",
    "for instance , it can be understood as a mere `` simplicity '' related to e.g. a minimum rank of the gauge group , the higgs sector dimensionality , the naturalness of the doublet - triplet splitting , or even the complexity of the gauge unification pattern . in this respect ,",
    "the models based on @xmath5 gauge group are frequently regarded to as more minimal than the @xmath4 ones .",
    "alternatively , predictivity ( i.e. , the number of independent couplings ) is often invoked as a measure of minimality ; what matters in such a case is namely the renormalizability of the theory , the number of higgs multiplets , the complexity of the gut - scale yukawa sector , the presence or absence of supersymmetry ( susy ) etc . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath4 guts ( especially their susy variants ) usually score better than the @xmath5 models , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . to us , even though potentially troublesome on the naturalness side , this is a very physical option - besides giving generally better prospects for an ultimate testability the preference of @xmath4 also offers a natural relief from the persistent trouble with the simplest @xmath5 models , failing either on the unification side ( like e.g. the original georgi - glashow model ) or suffering from an overly fast proton decay when susy is invoked see e.g. @xcite . ] .    sticking to the @xmath4 case ,",
    "minimality is essentially equivalent to the complexity of the higgs sector . in the class of @xmath4 guts ,",
    "the choice of the higgs representation is subject to several basic requirements .",
    "first , there is the need to break consistently the rank=5 @xmath4 gauge symmetry down to the rank=4 @xmath7 of the sm .",
    "remarkably , none of the basic candidate higgs representations ( namely , @xmath8 and/or @xmath9 ) capable of breaking the @xmath10 subgroup of @xmath4 , can account for the full @xmath11 breakdown on its own , since their sm singlets leave a full @xmath5 subgroup of @xmath4 intact . from the group theory point of view",
    ", the simplest solution one can devise is an extra adjoint @xmath12 in the higgs sector whose additional pair of vevs brings in enough freedom to provide the full @xmath13 breakdown .",
    "unfortunately , this approach fails in the susy case where the extra @xmath14-flatness conditions force the vevs in @xmath12 to align along the direction of @xmath15 and thus @xmath5 still remains intact @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath16 is usually invoked in the susy @xmath4 context , giving rise to the minimal susy @xmath4 gut with a higgs sector spanning over the reducible representation @xmath17 , see e.g. @xcite and also @xcite .    however",
    ", though successful in accounting for some of the basic features of the lepton flavour mixing @xcite , the minimal renormalizable susy so(10 ) model fails due to a generic tension between the absolute neutrino mass scale and the gauge coupling unification constraints , @xcite and there is a general need to go beyond the simplest setting , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .    on the other hand ,",
    "if predictivity rather than naturalness is at stakes , supersymmetry is not a mandatory ingredient of the @xmath4 guts because the unification constraints refuting the simplest non - susy @xmath5 settings can be satisfied with an intermediate energy scale @xmath18 below the scale of grand unification @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the recent analysis of the relevant symmetry breaking chains @xcite reveals an interesting picture associated to the two basic single - step chains @xmath20 driven by the simplest conceivable higgs sector spanned over just @xmath21 of @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , this scenario , requiring in practice a few orders of magnitude hierarchy between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , has been long ago @xcite claimed incompatible with the dynamics of the scalar sector .",
    "the reason is an emergence of tachyonic masses in the higgs spectrum unless @xmath18 essentially coincides with @xmath19 , at odds with the running constraints .    all these arguments are , however , based on the tree - level analysis of the higgs potential .",
    "remarkably enough , the recent work @xcite reveals a dramatic qualitative change of the picture once quantum effects are properly taken into account , with a potential of bringing the class of minimal non - supersymmetric @xmath4 guts back to life .",
    "in order to fully appreciate this fact one has to inspect in detail the available vacua of the renormalizable non - susy scalar potential spanned over @xmath21 in the higgs sector .",
    "however , before entering the realm of quantum effects one has to understand the origin of the tree - level no - go implied by @xcite .    the most generic classical renormalizable scalar potential one can write with only @xmath21 at hand reads @xmath22 , where @xcite @xmath23 correspond to the mass and self - interaction terms for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , while @xmath26 provides the desired interaction between the two sectors . employing an @xmath3 notation the vacuum manifold is parametrized by the vevs of the three different sm singlets @xmath27 since the gauge unification in this minimal scenario typically requires the @xmath28 breaking scale @xmath29 to be lower than the higher from the pair @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath31 ( to be identified with @xmath19 ) , the heavy higgs spectrum is governed namely by the vevs of @xmath24 . apart from the generic setting with non - zero @xmath32 corresponding to an intermediate @xmath33 stage , there are several important limiting cases exhibiting an enhanced intermediate symmetry , in particular @xmath34 the point is that while the first two cases ( corresponding to the simplest conceivable chains ( [ chainxii ] ) , ( [ chainviii ] ) ) are the only ones from list ( [ vacua ] ) which are compatible with the non - susy unification constraints @xcite , they seem to be disfavoured by the detailed higgs sector dynamics @xcite due to the emergence of tachyons within the corresponding vacua .",
    "this is due to the fact that a full - fledged analysis of the classical higgs potential ( [ potentialv45])-([potentialv4516 ] ) reveals a pair of scalar multiplets with the classical sm - level masses given by the formulae @xmath36 it is clear that in the majority of the parametric space , in particular , everywhere outside the domain @xmath37 at least one of them develops a negative mass - squared , indicating an instability of the corresponding vacuum configuration .",
    "consequently , all stable settings exhibit an intermediate flipped @xmath35 stage , at odds with unification constraints .",
    "this , indeed , is the core of the classical argument against the potential viability of the minimal non - susy @xmath4 gut framework .    since the simplicity of the formulae ( [ pgbmasses ] ) is crucial for the above reasoning it is important to understand their structure in as much detail as possible . in this respect",
    ", it is particularly illuminating to discuss the global symmetries of the scalar potential @xmath38 .",
    "when only trivial invariants ( i.e. moduli ) of both @xmath12 and @xmath8 are considered , the global symmetry of @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "it is spontaneously broken down to @xmath40 by the @xmath12 and @xmath8 vevs yielding 44 + 31=75 goldstone bosons in the scalar spectrum . since in this case",
    "also the gauge @xmath4 symmetry is broken to the sm gauge group , @xmath41 would - be goldstone bosons , with the quantum numbers of the coset @xmath42 algebra , decouple from the physical spectrum , while @xmath43 pseudo - goldstone bosons remain .",
    "their masses are generally expected to receive contributions from the explicitly breaking terms @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "however , the tree - level masses of the crucial @xmath48 and @xmath49 multiplets , which belong among these pseudo - goldstone bosons , turn out to depend only on the parameter @xmath44 but _ not _ on the other parameters expected , namely @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . while the @xmath45 and @xmath47 terms can not obviously contribute at the tree level to @xmath12 mass terms , one would generally expect a contribution from the @xmath46 term proportional to @xmath50 to pop up in relations  ( [ pgbmasses ] ) .",
    "this , however , is not the case .",
    "one can understand that on general grounds by observing that the relevant scalar interaction in ( [ potentialv4516 ] ) resembles the the covariant - derivative interaction responsible for the contribution of @xmath15 to the gauge boson masses . as a consequence ,",
    "no tree - level mass contribution from the @xmath46 coupling can be generated for the scalars in @xmath12 which carry the sm quantum numbers of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 bosons , i.e. , @xmath48 , and gluons @xmath49 that are protected by the residual @xmath5 symmetry left unbroken even with @xmath53 .",
    "on the other hand , we should expect the @xmath47 and @xmath46 interactions to contribute to the masses of @xmath48 and @xmath49 at the quantum level . while for the former the loops simply admit to contract the two @xmath8 s sticking out of the @xmath47-vertex in ( [ potentialv4516 ] ) , a similar loop due to a pair of @xmath46-vertices brings into play the @xmath5-breaking vevs of @xmath24 .",
    "similar contributions should also arise from the gauge interactions which break explicitly the independent global transformations on the @xmath12 and @xmath8 discussed in the previous section .    in the diagrammatic language ,",
    "the relevant one - loop self - energies are depicted in figure  [ graphs ] where the individual components of the scalars transforming as * 45 * and * 16 * of @xmath4 have been denoted by generic symbols @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . while the exchange of the components of @xmath8 is crucial",
    ", the @xmath29 does not need to enter ; in the phenomenologically allowed unification patterns it gives actually negligible contributions .",
    "the diagrammatic structure of the three important types of quantum corrections which stabilise the vacua supporting the desired @xmath2 ( case a ) or @xmath3 ( case b ) symmetry breaking chains at the one - loop level .",
    "the dangerous tachyonic mass parameters of the @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 higgs multiplets in @xmath12 are lifted provided @xmath56 in case a , or @xmath57 in case b. the interested reader can find further details in the original work @xcite.,title=\"fig:\"]the diagrammatic structure of the three important types of quantum corrections which stabilise the vacua supporting the desired @xmath2 ( case a ) or @xmath3 ( case b ) symmetry breaking chains at the one - loop level .",

    "let us emphasise that although one may in principle avoid the @xmath47-term by means of e.g. an extra @xmath58 symmetry , no symmetry can forbid the @xmath46-term and the gauge loop contributions .",
    "the quantum structure of the model vacuum is best assessed by the minimisation of the effective potential @xcite .",
    "it can be conveniently written as @xmath59 where the leading one - loop contribution to @xmath60 can be cast in the form @xmath61 \\ , .\\ ] ] here the terms in the bracket correspond to the contribution from the ( real ) scalars and gauge bosons , respectively , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the relevant field - dependent tree - level mass matrices .",
    "note also that the contribution due to the sm fermions has been neglected because of the hierarchical suppression of their masses with respect to the gut - scale higgs and gauge bosons . for completeness ,",
    "let us also mention that the specific form of @xmath60 corresponds to the landau gauge and the @xmath64 renormalization scheme .    using a generic symbol @xmath65 for any of the components of @xmath21 the first derivative of the one - loop part of the effective potential ( [ deltav ] ) is given by @xmath66+{\\rm gauge\\;part } \\,,\\ ] ]",
    "where , for the sake of simplicity , only the scalar contribution due to the first term in eq .",
    "( [ deltav ] ) has been written explicitly ; the gauge part derived from the @xmath63-piece of ( [ deltav ] ) is completely analogous .",
    "let us also note that the formula above holds regardless of the commutation properties of @xmath67 and its first derivatives .",
    "similarly , the second derivatives of @xmath60 can be written in the form @xmath68 \\left(\\log\\frac{\\mathcal{m}_{s}^2}{\\mu^2}-\\frac{3}{2}\\right ) + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{m}_{s}^2}{\\partial\\psi_a}\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{m}_{s}^2}{\\partial\\psi_b } + \\mathcal{m}_{s}^2\\frac{\\partial^{2 } \\mathcal{m}_{s}^2}{\\partial\\psi_a\\partial\\psi_b}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}(-1)^{m+1}\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{k=1}^{m}{m\\choose k}\\left\\ { \\mathcal{m}_{s}^{2 } , \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{m}_{s}^2}{\\partial\\psi_a}\\right\\ }    \\left[\\mathcal{m}_{s}^{2}, .. \\left[\\mathcal{m}_{s}^{2 } , \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{m}_{s}^2}{\\partial\\psi_b}\\right] .. \\right]\\left(\\mathcal{m}_{s}^{2}-1\\right)^{m - k } \\biggr\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { \\rm gauge\\;part } \\ , , \\label{der2deltav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the infinite series of nested commutators ( taken @xmath69 times for each @xmath70 ) looks after the general non - commutativity of @xmath62 and @xmath71 which becomes relevant here .",
    "note also that such terms are also crucial for a consistent cancellation of the infrared divergencies emerging in the one - loop mass matrix @xmath72 when evaluated for the solutions of the one - loop stationary equations @xmath73 .",
    "these are , of course , due to the presence of goldstone bosons in the landau gauge inherent to formula ( [ deltav ] ) .",
    "let us recall that the effective potential , however , is defined at zero external momenta , and the physical higgs spectrum is derived from the `` shifted '' mass matrix @xmath74 for @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the difference of the relevant one - loop self - energies evaluated at two different four - momenta .",
    "putting all this together , the quantum shifts in the masses of the two critical multiplets read @xmath77+{\\rm logs}\\ , , \\;\\;\\ ;   \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{810onthevac } \\delta m^2(8,1,0)_{45}&= & \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 } \\left [ \\tau^2 + \\beta^2(\\omega_r^2-\\omega_r\\omega_y+3\\omega_y^2 ) + g^4 \\left(13 \\omega _ r^2+\\omega _ y \\omega _",
    "_ y^2\\right)\\right]+{\\rm logs}\\,,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the symbols `` logs '' denote the sub - leading logarithmic contributions .",
    "it is easy to see that with these terms added to the tree - level structure ( [ pgbmasses ] ) both @xmath48 and @xmath49 mass - squares can be made simultaneously positive for wide ranges of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 parameters , well outside the classical domain ( [ classicallyallowed ] ) .",
    "this holds , especially , for the configurations with either @xmath78 or @xmath79 corresponding to the classically forbidden @xmath2 ( case a ) or @xmath3 ( case b ) intermediate symmetries . in particular , the dangerous tachyonic mass parameters of the @xmath48 and/or @xmath49 higgs multiplets in @xmath12 are lifted for @xmath56 in case a , or @xmath57 in case b.    thus , the quantum effects restore the full symmetry breaking potential of the minimal non - susy @xmath4 higgs sector spanned over @xmath21 , bringing back into play the symmetry breaking chains favoured by the gauge coupling unification constraints !",
    "let us also stress that the fact that @xmath10 has been broken by the spinorial @xmath25 does not play a major role in the argument so an alternative higgs model based on @xmath80 representation exhibits the same qualitative behaviour .",
    "similarly , an extra @xmath81 added to the higgs sector in order to get potentially realistic yukawa couplings makes no harm because it can not develop any gut - scale vevs .",
    "typically , only the minimal guts can be subject to a thorough scrutiny by complementary methods such as the proton lifetime constraints , the absolute neutrino mass scale or the match between the effective sm flavour structure and the underlying gut - scale yukawa sector . in this respect ,",
    "the recent failure of the minimal renormalizable susy @xmath4 gut re - opened the question of the potential viability of the simplest non - susy @xmath4 scenarios .",
    "remarkably , the generic no - go obtained about 30 years ago , which plagued the simplest model with @xmath21 in the higgs sector , has been recently identified as a mere artefact of the classical approach that is lifted at the quantum level .",
    "this reiterates the intriguing question whether a potentially viable and intrinsically consistent non - susy @xmath4 theory can be spanned over a renormalizable higgs sector with only @xmath21 ( or , alternatively , @xmath80 ) participating at the gut symmetry breakdown .",
    "the final answer , however , is left to a future analysis ."
