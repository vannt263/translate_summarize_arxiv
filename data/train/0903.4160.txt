    "in recent times there has been a rising interest in high - frequency gravitational waves ( hfgws ) , i.e.  waves with frequencies higher than @xmath1 .",
    "although most astrophysical sources radiate gravitational waves at much lower frequencies @xmath2 @xcite , the high frequencies might contain gravitational wave signal coming from the very early universe as well as some other sources and mechanisms such as cosmic strings , evaporation of light primordial black holes and effects associated with presence of higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "currently there is considerable interest in the possibility of building hfgw detectors capable of detecting these signals as well as signals created in laboratory @xcite . in light of the rising interest in hfgw it is instructive to analyze the possible observational constraints on the hfgw background .",
    "existing direct observational constraints on hfgws come from laser - inteferometer type experiment and are not very restrictive , @xmath3 at 100 mhz frequency @xcite . in this paper , in order to place constraints on the hfgws , we shall consider their possible signature in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) due to their interaction with large scale magnetic fields in the universe .",
    "gertsenshtein @xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that in a stationary electromagnetic field gravitons may decay into photons .",
    "a graviton propagating in a stationary electromagnetic field may interact with virtual photons of that field , and produce a real photon with almost the same frequency and wavevector as the original graviton ( see @xcite for a modern exposition ) . in the framework of classical field theory the graviton to photon conversion",
    "can be understood as a result of the interaction of a time varying metric perturbation field with a stationary electromagnetic field , leading to time variations in the latter , i.e. production of photons . in this paper",
    ", we shall analyze the observational consequences of the possible decay of gravitons into photons in the presence of magnetic fields with a view to place constraints on the hfgw background .",
    "there is currently ample evidence for widespread existence of magnetic fields in the universe @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields are known to exist in a wide variety of scales .",
    "the galactic magnetic fields have a characteristic strength of @xmath4 and coherence scales of a few kiloparsecs ( kpc ) . in clusters of galaxies ,",
    "the magnetic fields have a typical strength of @xmath5 and coherence lengths of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "of interest are the magnetic fields with field strength @xmath7 and coherence lengths of @xmath8 observed in the galaxy overdense filaments of typical size @xmath9 in the large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are strong reasons to believe that at the largest scales there exist magnetic fields of primordial origin @xcite .",
    "the tightest constraints on the strength of primordial magnetic fields ( pmf ) come from the analysis of anisotropies in the cmb and are limited to the present day by value of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the existence of these magnetic fields allows to place observational constraints on the strength of the possible hfgw background . in the presence of magnetic fields",
    "a sufficiently strong hfgw background would lead to the production of photons through the gertsenshtein effect that could be observed as distortions in the frequency spectrum of the cmb . on the other hand",
    ", the absence of these distortions would signify an upper limit on the strength of the hfgw background . in the present work we shall estimate the magnitude of the expected spectral distortions in the cmb and as a consequence",
    "analyze the possible constraints on hfgws . before proceeding to the main topic of the current paper ,",
    "it is worth pointing out that the large scale magnetic fields could themselves produce significant gravitational wave background @xcite .",
    "these gravitational waves would leave their imprint in the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cmb primarily at large angular scales corresponding to multipoles @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , in the present paper , we shall restrict our analysis to the interaction of an exogenous hfgw background with large scale magnetic fields .",
    "in a uniform magnetic field characterized by strength @xmath12 the probability of conversion of a graviton , travelling perpendicular to the magnetic field lines , into a photon is given by @xcite @xmath13 in the above expression @xmath14 is the coherence length for the graviton to photon conversion process . in perfect vacuum ,",
    "the coherence length @xmath14 is equal to the length of coherence of the magnetic field , i.e. distance over which the magnetic field remains homogenous .",
    "however , in the situations considered in the current work , the coherence length @xmath14 is determined primarily by the plasma effects . in presence of plasma ,",
    "the velocity of photons differs from the graviton velocity . for this reason ,",
    "the condition for resonant conversion of gravitons into photons will typically hold for shorter distances than in the case of pure vacuum ( see eqs .",
    "( 16,17 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the coherence length in the presence of plasma is given by the expression @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron density and @xmath17 is the frequency of the graviton as well as the subsequently created photon . in the above expression and through out the paper we use @xmath18 as the referential frequency since it corresponds to the theoretically predicted high frequency end of the spectrum of relic gravitons .",
    "in general , the coherence length @xmath14 is significantly smaller than the total linear dimensions of the magnetic field structure @xmath19 .",
    "the total number of coherent domains is given by the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "hence , the total probability of graviton - to - photon conversion in the magnetic field structure of length @xmath21 is given by @xmath22      let us analyze the conversion probabilities for magnetic fields associated with galaxy clusters and the magnetic fields in filaments .",
    "for estimating the probability of graviton - to - photon conversion in magnetic fields associated with galaxy clusters , we shall take the typical value @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the characteristic size of the galaxy cluster , its mean electron density and its characteristic magnetic field strength , respectively @xcite . substituting these values into ( [ equation3 ] ) we get @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of galaxy clusters along the line of sight . in the case of filaments",
    ", we set @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspondingly . in this case",
    "we arrive at a somewhat larger probability @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of filaments along the line of sight .",
    "simple estimations , where @xmath33 is the characteristic size of filament and @xmath34 is the typical size of voids .",
    "setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 we arrive at @xmath37 , and consequently @xmath38 . ]",
    "suggest that the factor @xmath32 could reach values @xmath39 .",
    "however , to avoid speculations , in our estimation below we shall set @xmath40 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in estimation of ( [ pgalaxycluster ] ) and ( [ pfilament ] ) we have assumed that the magnetic field is always pointing orthogonal to the line of sight .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that an exact evaluation involving appropriate averaging over the direction of the magnetic field would lead to a smaller probability but would not qualitatively change the result .",
    "let us estimate the graviton - to - photon conversion probability for primordial magnetic fields . in estimating the probability in the case of pmf the cosmological expansion and the associated decay of these magnetic fields",
    "must be taken into account . with the expansion of the universe the magnetic field scales in the following manner @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the characteristic value of primordial magnetic field at the present epoch , and",
    "@xmath43 is the cosmological redshift .",
    "the coherence length scales correspondingly as @xmath44 in the above expression the coherence scale length just after the epoch of recombination @xmath45 was calculated from ( [ equation2 ] ) setting @xmath46 , assuming a residual ionization fraction @xmath47 @xcite , and setting @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "note that , in the above expression and elsewhere in the text , @xmath17 represents the frequency of gravitons / photons at the present epoch . from the above expression",
    "it follows that the conversion probability in a single coherence domain ( [ equation1 ] ) is independent of the redshift @xmath50 thus , in order to estimate the total probability we need to calculate the total number of coherence domains crossed by a graviton .",
    "a graviton propagates through a single coherence scale in a time period @xmath51 . assuming a matter dominated cosmological evolution , i.e. @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the present day hubble constant , we arrive at the following integral for total number of coherent domains @xmath54",
    "since we are primarily interested in observational manifestations of graviton to photon conversion in cmb , we shall set @xmath55 and @xmath56 corresponding to the redshift of recombination and reionization respectively . since the universe was optically thick to cmb radiation prior to recombination , the signature of any graviton to photon conversion from an earlier epoch would not be seen . on the other hand , after reionization the coherence length dramatically reduces due to the increase in the density of free electrons @xmath16 ( see ( [ equation2 ] ) ) , and the conversion probability becomes negligible .",
    "numerical evaluation leads to @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the total probability of conversion is given by @xmath58 as can be seen , for a characteristic value of @xmath59 for the present day strength of the pmf , the conversion probability is almost two orders of magnitude larger than in the case of filaments .",
    "let us now estimate the expected electromagnetic signal due to the considered graviton - to - photon conversion . the electromagnetic energy flux @xmath60 would be proportional to the product of the gravitational wave energy flux @xmath61 multiplied by the total conversion probability @xmath62 , i.e.  @xmath63 .",
    "assuming a statistically isotropic gravitational wave background , the energy flux of the gravitational wave field can be expressed in terms of its energy density @xmath64 , where we have introduced the gravitational wave fraction of the critical density @xmath65 .",
    "the expected electromagnetic flux is thus given by @xmath66 in order to compare the flux with the sensitivity of various experiments , it is convenient to express the result in terms of brightness temperature .",
    "the brightness temperature is related to the electromagnetic flux by the relation @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the expected electromagnetic signal is given by @xmath68 comparing the flux for probabilities ( [ pgalaxycluster ] ) , ( [ pfilament ] ) and ( [ pprimordial ] ) , it can be seen that the strongest signal @xmath69 ( assuming @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) is expected due to graviton conversion in the presence of pmf .",
    "note that , the exact frequency dependence of the signal is determined by the frequency dependence of @xmath65 . from ( [ deltatflux ] ) , ( [ pgalaxycluster ] ) , ( [ pfilament ] ) and ( [ pprimordial ] ) it follows that , for a flat spectrum of hfgw ( i.e.  @xmath72 ) the expected signal scales as @xmath73 in terms of brightness temperature .      in order to analyze the potential observational prospects , it is instructive to compare the strength of the expected signal with the sensitivity of realistic detectors",
    ". recently , the ami experiment @xcite achieved a sensitivity @xmath74 at a frequency @xmath75 . in a typical cosmic microwave background experiment , at a frequency @xmath76 , for a @xmath77 resolution",
    ", the attainable sensitivity is @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the optimal frequency channel for constraining hfgws is a matter of trade - off between a signal weakening with increase in frequency on the one hand , and a lower foreground level at frequencies @xmath76 ( see for example p.  4 in @xcite ) on the other . in our case , a sensitivity of @xmath79 at 10 ghz corresponds to a sensitivity of @xmath80 at 100 ghz .",
    "additionally , it is worth noting that , potentially , the attainable sensitivity might be considerably increased by increasing the time of observation .",
    "a cmb experiment typically has to scan the whole sky , allowing for only @xmath81 per individual pixel . on the other hand",
    "if this time is increased to @xmath82 , the attainable sensitivity would improve to @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "however , such an increase in observation time would require a specially designed experiment dedicated solely to constraining hfgw background .",
    "depending on the strength of the primordial magnetic field @xmath42 . for comparison",
    "the horizontal lines represent the constraints due to magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and filaments .",
    "the shaded area indicates the region in parameter space that could be ruled out with current observations .",
    "the sensitivity level is set to @xmath85 at @xmath86 ( equivalent to a sensitivity @xmath87 at @xmath88 ) , and a red spatial spectrum for pmf is assumed . , width=377 ]    comparing the observational sensitivity with the expected signal due to hfgws in the cmb given by ( [ deltatflux ] ) in the context of pmf ( [ pprimordial ] ) , in the absence of a signal , we can place the following constraints on hfgw background @xmath89 on the other hand , hfgws with @xmath65 larger than the threshold value ( [ hfgwconstraint ] ) would leave an observable signature in the cmb .",
    "note that , the constraints on @xmath65 crucially depend on the strength of the pmf @xmath42 . for a typical value @xmath90",
    "these constraints are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude stronger than the analogous constraints due to magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and filaments . in figure [ figure1 ]",
    "we draw the potential constraints on @xmath65 depending on the strength of the pmf @xmath42 .",
    "the shaded regions represent the regions in @xmath42-@xmath65 space that could be potentially ruled out by observations . for comparison ,",
    "the two horizontal lines show the constraints that arise when considering the magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and filaments .    it is worth noting that in analyzing the potential constraints on @xmath65 through the process of graviton to photon conversion in the presence of magnetic fields we have ignored the inverse process of photon to graviton conversion .",
    "this inverse effect has the same probability given by ( [ equation1 ] ) .",
    "however , at frequencies @xmath91 , the energy density of cmb is several orders of magnitude smaller than the typical energy density of hfgw backgrounds considered in this work .",
    "for this reason , the total contribution of the inverse effect to changes in the electromagnetic flux remains subdominant .    a potential caveat in our ability to constrain hfgws arises due to the differential nature of cmb measurements .",
    "the conversion probability in presence of pmf is sufficiently isotropic , leading to predominantly isotropic signal in @xmath92 .",
    "the residual anisotropic variations would be @xmath93 .",
    "a conventional cmb experiment would be restricted to ability to measure only this residual anisotropic variations , weakening the potential constraints on @xmath65 . however , pmf produced during inflation with a sufficiently red spatial spectrum @xcite , may have significantly varying field strength amplitudes in various domains of sub - horizon scale . for these fields",
    "the conversion probability would be anisotropic leading to a large anisotropy in the expected signal . on the other hand",
    ", this isotropy problem would not arise when considering the cmb signal due graviton conversion in magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and filaments .",
    "a further caveat is also worth mentioning here . in order to detect or constrain the possible signal from hfgws in the cmb it is necessary to distinguish this signal from other potential mechanisms contributing to the anisotropies in cmb .",
    "the commonly considered contributions are the anisotropies due to density perturbations and relic gravitational waves , anisotropies due to sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , and anisotropies arising due to astrophysical foregrounds @xcite .",
    "however , these contributions , in general , can be subtracted due to their known frequency dependence .",
    "for example , it is known that , the anisotropies due to density perturbations and relic gravitational waves do not depend on frequency ( in temperature units , in the rayleigh - jeans region ) .",
    "we can estimate the sz effect in filaments following @xcite : @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ) .",
    "this signal has a well understood frequency dependence and for this reason can also be subtracted . finally , there are indications that the various astrophysical foregrounds , that typically have an amplitude @xmath97 at @xmath98 , could be effectively subtracted to a level @xmath99 outside the galactic plane @xcite .     finally , it is useful to compare the sensitivity of the cmb experiments with other methods .",
    "the only existing direct measurements of the hfgw background , using laser - interferometeric type detectors , place an upper limit @xmath3 in the frequency range around 100  mhz @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems highly unlikely that direct measurements would be able to compete with the sensitivity of cmb experiments in the foreseeable future .",
    "the most stringent constraint on the possible strength of the hfgw background of cosmological origin are placed by the concordance with the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "this concordance places an upper limit @xmath100 on the total , i.e. integrated over all frequencies , energy of the gravitational wave background ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , this limit assumes that the gravitational wave background was produced prior to the bbn .",
    "in contrast , the cmb experiments will also be sensitive to hfgw backgrounds produced at later epochs up to and around the period of recombination .",
    "moreover , cmb experiments can probe the gravitational wave background in a relatively narrow frequency bandwidth around @xmath18 and are therefore sensitive to sharply peaked hfgw spectra whose total energy might not exceed the bbn limit .",
    "in addition , a dedicated cmb experiment could improve sensitivity by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude , leading to a sensitivity comparable to the bbn limit . in any case , it is worth pointing out that cmb experiments provide an independent technique for observing or constraining hfgws .",
    "in this work , we have analyzed the implications of graviton to photon conversion in the presence of large scale magnetic fields .",
    "we have evaluated the conversion probability in the magnetic fields associated with galaxy clusters and filaments as well as primordial magnetic fields .",
    "our estimation imply that this conversion probability is highest for primordial magnetic fields ( assuming that pmf have a characteristic strength @xmath101 ) . assuming realistic values for the magnetic fields",
    ", we have shown that a sufficiently strong hfgw background would lead to an observable signature in frequency spectrum of the cmb .",
    "we argue that , this signature could be separated from other sources of variations in cmb like the sz and galactic foregrounds using their corresponding frequency dependences .",
    "the current day cmb experiments allow to place significant constraints on the hfgw background ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "these limits are about 25 orders of magnitude stronger than existing direct constraints in the high frequency region . furthermore , these limits could be improved by about 3 - 4 orders of magnitude in an experiment dedicated to constraining hfgws .",
