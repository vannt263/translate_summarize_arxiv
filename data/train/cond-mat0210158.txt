    "steady states of granular fluids require that energy be continuously supplied to the system , in order to compensate the energy loss in collisions . in many experimental situations ,",
    "this is done by means of a vibrating wall .",
    "if the vibration is strong enough , the steady state will correspond to a completely fluidized situation .",
    "the velocity distribution function ( vdf ) of a granular fluid in such a steady state has attracted a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "it has been studied theoretically , numerically , and by means of experiments , using very different drivings of the system .",
    "it seems clear at this stage that the results are strongly dependent on the characteristics of the driving mechanism , and also on the granular fluid itself . in this paper",
    ", we will be dealing with the vdf of a fluidized low density granular system in the presence of gravity , and in a situation when the number of wall - particle collisions is much smaller than the number of particle - particle collisions . in these conditions",
    ", one can expect that the vdf will be dominated by the intrinsic dynamics of the granular gas , and not by the peculiarities of the energy injection .",
    "one of the first experimental studies of the vdf of a granular fluid in the situation described above was carried out by warr _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they considered a vertical two - dimensional system of steel balls under vertical sinusoidal vibration , and found that the width of the vdf for the vertical ( @xmath0 ) and horizontal ( @xmath1 ) components of the velocity decreased as height increased , showing that the granular temperature was a decreasing function of height .",
    "besides , the distribution for @xmath1 seemed to be quite well fitted by a gaussian distribution .",
    "a similar result was found by helal _",
    "et al _ @xcite , who performed molecular dynamics simulations of a two dimensional system of hard disks , concluding again that the distribution function for @xmath1 was gaussian , at least in the thermal velocity region .",
    "a few years later , kudrolli and henry @xcite studied experimentally a system very similar to the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , but now the plane of the system formed a certain angle @xmath2 with the horizontal direction . by varying @xmath2 , the external ( gravitational ) field",
    "was modified , allowing to study the effect of varying the particle - particle and particle - wall number of collisions ratio .",
    "as the steady state exhibited gradients in the vertical direction , they studied the vdf in a region chosen so that density varied weakly inside it .",
    "they found that the width of the distribution for @xmath1 increased with @xmath2 , and that for the larger values of @xmath2 studied , the distribution was approximately gaussian .",
    "the authors claimed that this happened because increasing @xmath2 increases the frequency of particle - wall collisions , resulting in broader distributions .",
    "rouyer and menon @xcite have reported the results of another experimental study of a two dimensional system of steel balls in the presence of gravity . to avoid the effects of the inhomogeneities in the vdf",
    ", they placed the system between two identical vibrating walls , one located at the top and the other at the bottom of the system .",
    "for fast enough shaking , a symmetrical around the center of mass state was generated , with small gradients in the central region .",
    "the vdf was measured in that central region , and it was found that the distribution for the horizontal component of the velocity , when scaled with its width @xmath3 , showed an universal behavior .",
    "moreover , it could be fitted in the whole velocity range by means of a stretched exponential type of distribution , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , while @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants that can be determined from the normalization condition and the fact that the second moment must be unity , resulting @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "it must be noticed that , although the same type of behavior had been previously justified theoretically @xcite , it appeared in the context of uniformly heated systems , and was only displayed by the high energy tails of the velocity distribution . in this sense , it is remarkable that , for all the values of the parameters considered by rouyer and menon , and in the whole velocity range analyzed , the gaussian distribution provided always a worse fit to the experimental data than @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , previous studies had found a gaussian behavior , at least for some range of the parameters @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "one of the most important results reported in @xcite is the universality of @xmath10 , which was verified by the authors for quite a wide range of shaking intensities ( temperatures ) and number of particles ( densities ) of the system .",
    "they present this as a robust property and , in fact , it has been used as a guide to develop a model for vibrated granular systems @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , recent experiments by blair and kudrolli @xcite suggest that the scaled horizontal vdf of a vibrated granular system depends on the number of particles , and only when this number is small enough it can be well fitted by @xmath10 .",
    "it can be argued that the reason for this apparent contradiction is that the experimental setup was different in both cases and , in fact , inhomogeneities were stronger in the experiment by blair and kudrolli than in the one by rouyer and menon .",
    "whether these inhomogeneities are enough to destroy the universal behavior found by rouyer and menon is not clear at the moment .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the distribution function of the horizontal component of the velocity of a vibrated granular fluid in the presence of gravity by using molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "computer simulations are a very useful tool to study the velocity distribution of a system , as they provide detailed information about positions and velocities of all particles of the system at any moment .",
    "the construction of the corresponding distributions is straightforward , and averages over different times and initial conditions provide the statistical accuracy needed to compute the tails of the distributions .",
    "the goal of this study is to clarify the behavior of the velocity distribution of a fluidized low density granular system in the presence of gravity , and , in particular , to investigate the existence of a universal scaling behavior , independently of the parameters of the system .",
    "we consider a two dimensional system of @xmath11 inelastic hard disks of diameter @xmath12 and mass @xmath13 , whose collisions are characterized by a constant coefficient of normal restitution @xmath14 .",
    "there is a gravity field @xmath15 , acting in the negative direction of the @xmath16 axis , and a vibrating wall located at the bottom of the system ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the system size in the @xmath18 direction is @xmath19 , and periodic boundary conditions are employed in that direction . besides , and unless otherwise indicated , the system is opened at the top .",
    "the vibrating wall is elastic , and moves in a sawtooth manner , i.e. , all particles colliding with the wall find it moving upwards with velocity @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the wall vibration will be considered so small as compared with the mean free path of the particles , that the position of the wall can be taken accurately as fixed at @xmath17 .",
    "although this is clearly an ideal approximation to the movement of a real vibrating wall , we will be studying the vdf in regions not too close to the wall , so the details of its movement are expected to be unimportant .",
    "the described system exhibits a steady state with gradients only in the direction of gravity which has been well characterized in the low density limit@xcite by using a hydrodynamic description .",
    "this steady state depends both on @xmath14 and @xmath21 , which is proportional to the number of monolayers in the direction of gravity at rest .",
    "it must be pointed out that this state is not always stable , and inhomogeneities appear in the transversal direction if the system is wide enough , both with and without gravity @xcite . in this work , we are interested in the vdf of the transversally homogeneous state , so the parameters will be chosen to ensure that inhomogeneities do not show up in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the evolution of the system was followed by using standard event driven molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , for several values of the parameters . in particular , the coefficient of normal restitution was always in the range @xmath22 , which contains the value @xmath23 characteristic of steel balls used in most of the mentioned experiments .",
    "the system width @xmath19 was given a value @xmath24 , which was small enough as to ensure homogeneity in the direction perpendicular to gravity for the values of @xmath14 considered .",
    "the gravity field was set to @xmath25 , while @xmath13 defines the unit of mass and @xmath12 the unit of length .",
    "the velocity of the vibrating wall was chosen in each case such that the number density , @xmath26 , was always bellow a small enough value , @xmath27 , even in the denser regions of the system .",
    "finally , for every value of @xmath14 , several different values of the number of particles were considered , in order to study its possible influence on the vdf .",
    "let us notice that , as the system width @xmath19 is fixed , changing the number of particles is equivalent to changing the number of monolayers @xmath28 , which is the relevant parameter .",
    "the simulations started from an arbitrary initial situation that was left to evolve until the system reached a steady state .",
    "typical density and temperature profiles in the steady state are shown in fig .",
    "although the details of the profiles depend on the particular values of the parameters of the system , in all the cases reported here the density goes through a maximum at a certain height , while the temperature reaches a minimum , increasing from there on .",
    "it is important to notice that the temperature minimum does not coincide with the density maximum , and that the condition of small density gradient in a given region of the system does not imply small temperature gradient in it at all . in order to avoid the effect of inhomogeneities in the vdf ,",
    "we have considered narrow layers perpendicular to the direction of the gradients at different positions throughout the system .",
    "the height of the cells @xmath29 was chosen so that the variation of density and temperature within them were negligible .",
    "for instance , in the case displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the value @xmath30 was used .",
    "cells at different positions will be considered to get information about the velocity distribution throughout the whole system .",
    "the distribution function for @xmath1 , @xmath31 in each cell is constructed by sampling the velocities of particles inside it at different times , once the system was in the steady state . besides",
    ", also different trajectories starting from different initial conditions were considered in the average process , in order to improve the statistics .",
    "as the system is inhomogeneous in the @xmath16 direction , @xmath31 is expected to depend on height , @xmath32 .",
    "previous studies suggest that this dependence occurs only through the second moment of the distribution , but this is a result that has not been proved up to now for vibrated granular systems in presence of gravity .",
    "we then define a scaled velocity by @xmath33 and a scaled velocity distribution , @xmath34 if all the dependence of the distribution on height occurs through the second moment ( i.e. the temperature ) , @xmath35 must be independent on height .",
    "this is one of the points to be checked in the simulations .",
    "in figs . [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the scaled velocity distribution @xmath35 for @xmath36 and two different values of the number of particles , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , is plotted .",
    "the different symbols correspond to different heights in the system , as indicated in the figures .",
    "the solid line is the gaussian distribution , while the dotted - dashed line is the stretched exponential @xmath10 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1:1 ] ) .",
    "the layers whose distribution is displayed in the figures are located before the density maximum , at the maximum , and after it .",
    "the position of the density maximum is @xmath41 for both number of particles .",
    "the reason to display both @xmath35 and its logarithm is that the former provides visual information about the distribution for thermal velocities , while the latter is more convenient to identifying the behavior of the tails of the distribution .",
    "the first point we want to investigate is whether the spatial dependence of the velocity distribution can be scaled out with its ( local ) second moment .",
    "if we consider the natural plot of @xmath35 , the answer to this question may seem affirmative , at least in very good approximation . for given values of the parameters of the system ,",
    "the symbols corresponding to different heights fall onto the same curve . nevertheless , if we pay attention to the tails of the distribution , the answer is not so clear .",
    "closer inspection of the logarithmic plots of @xmath35 shows that the scaling is not exact , and , in particular , the distribution corresponding to the layer located at the density maximum has always the most populated tail and , therefore , is the narrowest distribution .",
    "this implies that the height dependence of the distribution has not been completely scaled out . besides",
    ", the differences in shape of @xmath35 at different heights can not be a consequence of averaging in space an inhomogeneous distribution , since the height of the layers is very small , as indicated above .",
    "still , it could happen that the deviations from the scaling behavior were only relevant in a narrow region around the density maximum . to investigate whether this is the case , and also to provide a more quantitative measurement of the departure from the scaling , we have computed the scaled fourth moment of the distribution , @xmath42 , defined as @xmath43 if the velocity distribution depended on height only through its second moment , @xmath42 would be constant through the system . if , in addition , the velocity distribution were a gaussian , @xmath44 , while if it were given by the stretched exponential @xmath10 , @xmath45 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] @xmath42 has been plotted as a function of height for @xmath36 and @xmath46 , respectively . in each case , several values of the number of particles in the system have been considered .",
    "the range of @xmath32 plotted corresponds to the relevant region in the system , i.e. , before the density decays to a very low value . in all cases",
    ", @xmath42 exhibits a clear dependence on height . for given @xmath14 ,",
    "the failure of the scaling is more evident the larger the number of particles in the system .",
    "in fact , it is the number of particles and not the density the parameter governing the behavior of the vdf , as far as the system is fluidized .",
    "this has been checked by changing @xmath20 for fixed @xmath14 and @xmath11 , which implies modifying the density of the system , since it is opened at the top .",
    "the curves obtained for @xmath42 were identical if the height was properly scaled with the vibrating velocity being used .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 always follows the same trend : it takes a value very close to the gaussian one in the vicinity of the vibrating wall , then passes trough a maximum , and decays to a more or less constant value that depends on both @xmath14 and @xmath11 .",
    "comparison of the behavior of @xmath42 with the density and temperature profiles in each case shows that the position of the maximum of @xmath42 is close to the density maximum , while the region with a roughly constant value of the scaled fourth moment occurs beyond the temperature minimum",
    ". it must be noticed as well that , for the largest number of monolayers considered , @xmath42 seems to increase for large heights .",
    "although it is true that the statistical noise there is large , increasing the statistics does not change the observed behavior .",
    "the first conclusion emerging from the simulations is that the dependence on height of the transversal vdf of a vibrated granular gas in the presence of gravity can not be scaled out with its width , i.e. , with the local transversal granular temperature of the system .",
    "this might appear as rather surprising , especially taking into account what happens in other states of a granular gas .",
    "for instance , in the homogeneous cooling state , the vdf depends on time , but this dependence can be completely scaled out with the temperature , and the scaled fourth velocity moment reaches a plateau after a transient period @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is true that , for the cases reported here , the scaling can be taken as an accurate approximation in the thermal velocity region , at least for a not too large number of particles in the system . besides , the more inelastic the system , the smaller the number of monolayers for which deviations from scaling begin to be significant .",
    "figures [ fig2]-[fig5 ] also indicate that , even if we neglect the height dependence , the shape of the distribution still depends both on the inelasticity and the number of monolayers .",
    "for instance , in the case of fig .",
    "@xmath47 , the vdf is very well approximated by a gaussian distribution for velocities up to @xmath48 .",
    "some deviations from the gaussian appear for large velocities , but they are not very significant .",
    "as the number of particles is increased , keeping @xmath14 fixed , the deviations from the gaussian shape become large , and the distribution gets narrower .",
    "this is the case of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where @xmath35 lies between the gaussian distribution and @xmath10 for thermal velocities , but the tail of the distribution is better approximated by the latter .",
    "if the number of particles is further increased , the distribution becomes narrower , in fact , narrower than @xmath10 .",
    "again , as it happened with the scaling , the smaller @xmath14 , the smaller the number of particles for which deviations from the gaussian distribution appear , as it follows from figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "some authors have argued that , in a vibrated granular system , collisions with the wall tend to randomize the vdf , rendering it wide , while collisions between particles act as the ordering factor , because particle velocities are more parallel after collisions than before @xcite . to check",
    "if this argument is consistent with our simulation results , we have computed @xmath49 , the ratio between the number of particle - particle and particle - wall collisions .",
    "we found that , as expected , it is an increasing function of the number of monolayers in the system .",
    "for instance , for @xmath36 we found @xmath50 for @xmath37 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath39 .",
    "since , as indicated above , the width of the distribution decreases as the number of particles increases , we conclude that the larger @xmath49 , the narrower the vdf .",
    "moreover , the more inelastic the system , the more parallel the velocities after collisions , and the `` ordering '' mechanism is expected to be more efficient .",
    "this explains why , although for @xmath46 and @xmath54 it is @xmath55 , the distribution is in this case narrower than the narrowest reported here for @xmath36 , which corresponds to larger values of the ratio @xmath49 .",
    "finally , the fact that the accuracy of the fit of the vdf to both @xmath10 and the gaussian distribution depends in most of the cases on the velocity interval considered , implies that @xmath35 can not be fitted by a stretched exponential function @xmath56 , with a single value of the exponent @xmath57 , in the whole velocity range .",
    "all the above discussion suggests , in our opinion , that the role played by the gaussian distribution and @xmath10 in the context of vibrated granular gases is very different .",
    "the gaussian distribution is a limiting behavior for small enough number of particles and not too inelastic systems . as the number of particles in the system increases , the scaled velocity distribution becomes narrower . in this range of parameters",
    ", @xmath10 is just a good fit valid in some cases , but it does not represent a universal behavior , not even a limiting behavior of the vdf for some well - defined conditions .",
    "given that the conclusions reached up to now in this work are so different from those emerging from the experiments reported by rouyer and menon @xcite , it seems worth to simulate the same kind of boundary conditions they use , in order to discard that the discrepancies are due to peculiarities of the boundaries .",
    "therefore , instead of considering just one vibrating wall at @xmath17 , we have added another vibrating wall at @xmath58 .",
    "the choice of the maximum height , @xmath59 , of the system , was made as to obtain very similar system dimensions as those in ref .",
    "the two vibrating walls are identical , and the vibrating velocity is chosen to generate symmetric around the center of the system stationary density and temperature profiles .",
    "the total number of particles was varied in the range @xmath60 . in each case",
    ", we started from a homogeneous state , that was left to evolve until a stationary situation was reached .",
    "then , the transversal vdf was computed in a layer located in the the center of the system , namely between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "care was taken that the system remained in a fluidized state in that central region .",
    "note that , in this way and as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , the vdf is measured now in a quite wide region of the system , and not in a narrow layer as we did in the previous study of the open system . even if the gradients in that central region are expected to be small",
    ", they will be non vanishing , and the nonuniformity might influence the shape of the vdf .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we have plotted the scaled distribution @xmath35 for @xmath23 , which is roughly the value of the coefficient of restitution for the steel balls used in @xcite , and three different values of the number of particles . as it was the case for the open system , the scaled vdf is seen to depend on the number of particles , becoming narrower as @xmath11 increases .",
    "this can be interpreted again in terms of the role of the particle - particle versus particles - wall number of collisions , as also in this case the ratio @xmath49 is an increasing function of the number of monolayers .",
    "more specifically , we found from the simulation data that @xmath63 for @xmath37 , @xmath64 for @xmath52 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .    the relevant role of the stretched exponential @xmath10 is also questioned by fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . in all the cases displayed , the distribution for thermal velocities lies between the gaussian and @xmath10 .",
    "the tail of the distribution gets closer to @xmath10 the larger @xmath11 , and in fact only in the case @xmath66 is well fitted by the stretched exponential .",
    "therefore , again the distribution can not be fitted by a single stretched exponential in the whole velocity range .",
    "this is more clearly realized in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where @xmath67 has been plotted as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "let us notice that , if the distribution were some general stretched exponential , @xmath56 , this plot would give a straight line whose slope would provide the exponent @xmath57 .",
    "the symbols in the figure are from the simulations . also plotted are two straight lines , one corresponding to @xmath69 ( gaussian behavior ) and the other one to @xmath70 ( @xmath10 ) as a guide to the eye . a transition from gaussian behavior for thermal velocities to a distribution with a smaller exponent @xmath57 for larger velocities",
    "is observed in all cases .",
    "the results discussed up to now correspond to the vdf in the central region of the system . nevertheless , we expect the transversal scaled vdf to depend also on @xmath32 in this case . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , @xmath42 has been plotted as a function of height for the same values of the parameters as in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "again , we find that the dependence on height and the deviations from the gaussian are larger the larger the number of monolayers .",
    "as expected , @xmath42 is symmetric around the center of mass .",
    "the exhibited double peak clearly indicated that the maximum of @xmath42 does not happen either at the density maximum or at the temperature minimum , since they are both located at the center of the system .",
    "the transversal velocity distribution of a vibrated granular gas in the presence of gravity has been studied by using molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "it has been found that the shape of the distribution depends both on the inelasticity of the system and the number of monolayers in the direction of gravity . besides , it depends on height , and this dependence can not be fully scaled out with its width , i.e. , with the local transversal granular temperature of the system .",
    "this contrasts with some previous reported results for granular gases under similar conditions . on the other hand , it is true that the scaling provides a quite accurate approximation valid for not too inelastic systems and for not too large number of monolayers at rest .    for a given value of the coefficient of restitution @xmath14 , the transversal velocity distribution becomes narrower as the number of monolayers in the system is increased .",
    "this can be understood by taking into account that increasing the number of monolayers increases the ratio of number of particle - particle collisions against particle - wall collisions . in a granular system ,",
    "the particle - particle collisions tend to suppress `` noise '' in the velocity distribution , as the velocities after the collision are more parallel than before it .",
    "then , it is sensible to expect that , the larger the relative number of particle - particle collisions , the narrower the velocity distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "the more inelastic the system the more effective each collision in narrowing the velocity distribution .    the role played by the gaussian distribution and the stretched exponential @xmath10 has also been clarified .",
    "while the gaussian is a limiting behavior shown in the quasi - elastic and small number of monolayers limit , @xmath10 appears just as a good fit for the velocity distribution for some range of values of the parameters characterizing the system ."
