    "the competition between the tendency of electrons to delocalize and the presence of electron - electron interaction , electron - phonon interaction  often combined with spin - phonon interaction  is the origin of the extremely rich phase diagrams in the condensed matter systems with reduced dimension.@xcite among the most intriguing phenomena found in these systems are broken - symmetry phases like charge- and spin - density waves ( cdw , sdw ) , charge orders ( co ) , antiferromagnetic , spin - peierls phases and superconductivity .",
    "these phases show a large variety of nonlinear properties and complex dynamics , including collective excitations.@xcite .",
    "while the conventional ( 2@xmath13 ) cdw implies periodically modulated charge density and is caused by the electron - phonon interaction , the @xmath14 charge modulation of wigner - crystal type , often called charge ordering , originates from strong on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath15 .",

    "the abrupt onset of static charge order below @xmath4  k is signaled by a splitting of molecular vibrations @xmath3 and a dramatic drop of the optical conductivity .",
    "its anisotropy does not change much in contrast to anisotropy of dc conductivity which rises steeply with decreasing temperature .",
    "charge redistribution detected in the co phase corresponds nicely to the one estimated from the x - ray data.@xcite similar to the peierls cdw state , we observe long - wavelength charge excitations with an anisotropic phason - like dispersion , which surface as broad screened relaxation modes along the @xmath11- and @xmath12-axes of the bedt - ttf planes .",
    "in addition , we detect short - wavelength charge excitations in the form of domain - wall pairs , created due to inversion symmetry breaking , which are less mobile and induce a much weaker polarization , again along both crystallographic axes .",
    "possible theoretical interpretations are discussed and arguments are given that the nature of the horizontally - striped co phase is a cooperative bond - charge density wave rather than a fully localized wigner crystal .",
    "dc resistivity was measured between room temperature and 40  k by standard four - contact technique . in the frequency range 0.01  hz10  mhz the spectra of the complex dielectric function were obtained from the two - contact complex conductance measured by two setups .",
    "the low - frequency , high - impedance setup covers the 0.01  hz  3  khz range .",

    "even though the impedance analyzer reaches frequencies up to 110  mhz , we are limited to approximately 6  mhz by cable length .",
    "the applied ac signal levels , typically 50  mv ( 1  v / cm ) , were well within the linear response regime ( upper bound verified to be at least 6  v / cm ) .",

    "the @xmath35-axis of the crystal corresponds to the direction perpendicular to sample plane .",
    "the reflectivity measurements were performed on as - grown surfaces ; for our @xmath35-axis investigation we employed an infrared microscope .",
    "contacts for dc and ac conductivity measurements were made by applying carbon paint directly to sample surface .",
    "on our first studied single crystal contacts have been prepared parallel to sample edges without prior orienting the sample .",

    "orientexpress3.3 software@xcite was applied to simulate the recorded flat back reflection patterns .",
    "additional experiments were conducted on needle - like samples cut from one single crystal that was oriented by recording the mid - infrared spectra .",

    "the dc and ac conductivity on those samples was measured parallel to the @xmath11-axis ( perpendicular to stripes ; along this direction cr and cp sites alternate ) and parallel to the @xmath12-axis ( along the stripes ) .    with scrutiny we ruled out any influence of extrinsic effects in the dielectric spectroscopy measurements , especially those due to contact resistance and surface layer capacitance .",
    "of the two relaxation modes detected in the dielectric response , the smaller one has a temperature - independent relaxation time , thus it can be identified as an intrinsic property of the sample . on the other hand , the larger dielectric mode bears features which might indicate a maxwell - wagner - like relaxation at the contacts@xcite and requires a thorough verification of contact quality . with this in mind , we performed dc resistance measurements in the standard four- and two - contact configurations . taking into account the difference in geometry between contacts in these two configurations ,",
    "the four - point resistance can be scaled and subtracted from the two - point resistance in order to estimate contact resistance ( @xmath37 ) _ vs. _  sample bulk resistance ( @xmath38 ) . in the insulating",

    "only the dielectric spectra in the immediate vicinity of @xmath24 were under influence of instrument artefact and therefore disregarded .",
    "namely , above 135  k the sample conductivity becomes greater than the imaginary part of admittance @xmath40 by a factor of 1000 or more in the whole range of frequency @xmath41 , an instrument limit beyond which no meaningful measurements of capacitance @xmath42 can be made .",
    "despite the numerous reports on the optical properties of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2,@xcite a few aspects of the development right at or below the charge - order transition are worthwhile to be reconsidered in the present context .",
    "here we concentrate on two issues .",
    "the first is the conductivity and reflectivity in the highly - conducting ( @xmath5 ) plane at the metal - to - insulator phase transition which yield information on the anisotropy and the energy gap .",
