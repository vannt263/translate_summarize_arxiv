    "analytical methods typically use a chemical picture where electrons , ions and bound states ( atoms , molecules etc . )",
    "are treated as independent species , and the chemical composition ( degree of ionization ) is computed from a mass action law ( non - ideal saha equation ) .",
    "however , these methods are based on perturbation expansions in the coupling strength and are thus limited to regions of small coupling parameters , @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the quantum coupling parameter , @xmath5 ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass action law becomes increasingly inaccurate in the region where the electrons are degenerate ( uncertainty in the mass action constants ) .",
    "also , during rapid pressure ionization around the mott density the distinction between free and bound particles is an open problem .    on the other hand , in the last decade",

    "this first principle numerical technique is well suited for an accurate treatment of many - particle correlation effects in quantum systems , but unfortunately does not give dynamical characteristics of the plasma ( with an exception of those obtained within the linear response theory ) .",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ ep_s ] we discuss different methods to obtain an effective quantum pair potential . in the weak coupling limit , this potential leads exactly to the off - diagonal kelbg potential the properties of which are being discussed and compared to its commonly used diagonal approximation .",

    "on the other hand , for an electron - proton pair the slater sum can be written as @xmath46 where the last term shows the contribution of the bound states .",

    "the main conclusion that can be drawn from the presented pimc results is that , at equal number of factorization factors @xmath182 , simulations with the off - diagonal kelbg potential are significantly more accurate in reproducing the `` exact '' thermodynamic results of a hydrogen atom . besides , the full off - diagonal density matrix contains valuable information about the spatial electron distribution around the proton , which is lost in the end - point approximation .",
    "further , we expect that the best results will be obtained using _ an improved off - diagonal _ kelbg potential , which has the correct zero - point value and contains the complete angular dependence of the pair density matrix which , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this section , we apply the improved kelbg potentials in classical molecular dynamics simulations of dense hydrogen . classical md simulations of dense plasmas have been performed by many authors before where the divergency at zero distance leading , in particular , to the classical collapse of an electron into a proton , is usually avoided by some cutoff or `` regularization '' of the coulomb potential at small distances . using in this paper , effective quantum pair potentials obtained from the exact solutions of the bloch equations , we expect to be on well founded grounds regarding the correct pair interactions at short distances .",

    "it turns out that the reason for these deviations is not a failure of the used quantum pair potentials .",
    "thus the only source for the deviations in the full simulation can be many - particle effects beyond the two - particle level .    to verify this hypothesis we performed a careful inspection of the microscopic particle configurations in the simulation box . at high temperatures , the particle trajectories are those of a fully ionized classical plasma . at temperatures below on ry , we observe an increasing number of electrons undergoing strong deflections on protons and eventually performing quasibound trajectories .",

    "this turns out to be the reason for the observed very low energy because the attractive coulomb interaction contributions are becoming dominant in the total energy . of course",
    ", this behavior is not surprising : while all pair interaction processes are modelled correctly even at low temperature ( which is assured by the fit parameters in the improved kelbg potentials ) , as soon as three or more particles are being closely together , three - particle and higher order correlations are becoming increasingly strong ( they , in particular , account for the formation of the larger bound state complexes described above ) .",
    "however , it was just the approximation used in the derivation of the quantum potentials that three - particle and higher correlations can be neglected which was the basis for the use of pair potentials in modelling the whole @xmath116-particle system . while molecular dynamics , of course , includes any level of correlations , the use of the present potentials means that _ quantum corrections to three - body ( and higher order ) interactions _ are not adequately captured .",
    "therefore , it is no surprise that this approximation breaks down at sufficiently low temperature , and this break down occurs around the temperature corresponding to the binding energy of hydrogen molecules . from this we can conclude that molecule formation sets the limit of the applicability of the present semiclassical md simulations .",

    "these can be identified explicitly .",
    "in addition there are the more difficult parts due to exchange and correlations .",

    "determination of this functional is the central issue of the discussion here , and we will show that it is closely related to the kelbg potential analyzed in the bulk of this paper .",
    "the definition of the functional @xmath253 is straightforward from the representation of the density for an _ ideal fermi gas _ in the external potentials @xmath254 this is a single particle problem .",
    "the right side is clearly a functional of @xmath255 through the dependence of the eigenvalues of @xmath256 on the form of the external potential .",
    "interestingly , even at the level of the ideal gas determination of this functional is non - trivial . in the _ non - degenerate limit _",
    "this equation for the density becomes @xmath257if the external potential is chosen to be a coulomb source , then ( [ 1.13 ] ) becomes equivalent to the diagonal elements of the two particle density matrix in relative coordinates which has exactly the form of the pair distribution function used to define the effective quantum pair potential , cf .",
    "( [ exact_diag_u ] ) .",
    "once the exchange and correlation free energy functional is specified ( guessed ) , ( [ 1.11 ] ) provides a set of closed _ classical _ integral equations for the equilibrium densities .",
    "as will  be seen below , a leading approximation is the usual boltzmann - poisson representation in terms of semi - classical potentials .",
    "the primary technical difficulty in this prescription is the determination of @xmath258 .",
    "kohn and sham noted that ( [ 1.11 ] ) defines an effective single particle potential and therefore is formally equivalent to the ideal gas in this effective potential .",
    "therefore , the solution can be constructed by solving the one particle schrdinger equation whose potential is the right side of ( [ 1.11 ] ) , and calculating the densities from the associated form ( [ 1.12 ] ) self - consistently @xmath259 this avoids the difficult problem of finding the functional @xmath253 but at the cost of having to solve a set of self - consistent schrdinger equations .",
    "consider instead an approximate evaluation of the potential @xmath253 in terms of an effective quantum potential @xmath260 defined by @xmath261 the first equality is similar to a finite temperature thomas - fermi representation , with a local chemical potential given by @xmath262 .",
    "an important difference discussed below is that @xmath263 .",
    "the functional relationship of @xmath264 to @xmath265 and hence to @xmath260 is that for an ideal gas and is well - known . the second equality of ( [ 1.15 ] )",
    "defines the semi - classical potential @xmath266 as a functional of @xmath267 .",
    "this relationship of @xmath268 to @xmath267 is more difficult to unfold .",
    "however , it is straightforward to discover it for weak coupling of the system to the perturbing potential .",
    "the analysis is similar to the derivation of the kelbg potential and will not be repeated here .",
    "formally make the replacement @xmath269 in ( [ 1.15 ] ) with the corresponding dependence on @xmath270 inherited by @xmath260 . then perform the expansion of @xmath260 to first order in @xmath270 , setting @xmath271 at the end , to get @xcite @xmath272where @xmath273 is the well - known static linear polarization function in random phase approximation , @xmath274 containing the fermi distribution @xmath275 in this approximation , the functional relationship between the density and the potential is now known@xmath276 now it is straightforward to improve this results by substitution of ( [ 1.11 ] ) into the right side of ( [ 1.19 ] ) which gives a generalization of the thomas - fermi approximation to include strong coupling effects .",
    "however , even if @xmath277 is neglected the result is the thomas - fermi approximation in terms of the potential @xmath278 rather than the bare potential @xmath279 , which has short ranged divergences for opposite charge interactions .",
    "the result here in terms of the _ nonlocal effective quantum potential _ appears to be a new one that cures some of the well - known problems of the `` local approximation '' thomas - fermi theory .",
    "as indicated below , @xmath280 becomes just the kelbg potential in the non - degenerate limit .",
    "the result ( [ 1.19 ] ) with ( [ 1.11 ] ) is a non - linear integral equation for the density , including both _",
    "strong coupling and degeneracy effects_. there is no longer any need to solve the kohn - sham equations and the problem is one of purely classical analysis .",
    "it is instructive to consider the non - degenerate limit . in that case",
    "the polarization function is evaluated using @xmath281 .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ 1.19 ] ) simplifies to @xmath282 use of these in the dft equation ( [ 1.11 ] ) gives the closed equation for the densities @xmath283 the potentials @xmath284 and @xmath285 are `` regularized '' by the polarization function , e.g. , @xmath286 it is possible to show @xcite that in this _ non - degenerate limit _",
    "@xmath287 _ is just the original kelbg potential _ , eq .",
    "( [ kelbg - d ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the weak coupling limit where @xmath277 can be neglected ( [ 1.21 ] ) becomes the usual boltzmann - poisson equation with effective quantum potentials given by the kelbg potential ( [ kelbg - d ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "dft applications can be performed in a semi - classical form without solving the kohn - sham equations by introducing effective quantum potentials .",
    "this can be done in a weak coupling approximation similar to that first described by kelbg and yields a closed analytical result ( [ kelbg - d ] ) .",
    "based on the results of the above analysis , it can be expected that this approach can be extended by incorporating as well effects of degeneracy by using for the density eq .",
    "( [ 1.12 ] ) instead of ( [ 1.20a ] ) . furthermore by using _",
    "improved quantum pair potentials _  along the lines of the improved kelbg potentials discussed in the previous sections  an accurate treatment of the pair problem is achieved laying the foundation for advancing dft to the regime of strong coupling .",
    "in this work we presented an analysis of generalized quantum pair potentials . extending the work of kelbg and others we investigated in detail _ effective off - diagonal and diagonal quantum pair potentials _ for a correlated hydrogen plasma including spin effects .",
    "we studied the accuracy of these potentials by an extensive comparison with the exact solutions of the bloch equation .",
    "further , we proceeded to an analysis of _ improved diagonal quantum pair potentials _ by correcting the value of the kelbg potential at zero particle separation .",
    "excellent agreement with the exact solutions of the two - particle bloch equations could be achieved with the help of a single temperature - dependent fit parameter for which an accurate analytical pad formula was presented .",
    "this lead to significantly improved diagonal pair potentials compared to the original kelbg potential .",
    "moreover , these potentials are explicitly spin - dependent and retain the advantage of a closed analytical expression .",
    "these potentials have been applied in path integral monte carlo and `` semiclassical '' molecular dynamics simulations of dense hydrogen and were found to give accurate results over a wide range of parameters .",
    "one important conclusion , of relevance to pimc simulations , is that the off - diagonal potential gives essentially more accurate results ( or more rapid convergence ) than its diagonal limit , quantitative estimates have been provided .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated that the spin - dependent improved diagonal potentials are of high use for `` semiclassical '' molecular dynamics simulations of partially ionized plasmas .",
    "our analysis revealed that with these potentials one can successfully simulate dense hydrogen up to moderate coupling and degeneracy , from the fully ionized to the partially ionized regime .",
    "the present potentials allow us to correctly model dense plasmas up to temperatures as low as the molecular binding energy .",
    "further improvements are possible , including the description of molecular hydrogen , but they require to include three - particle and four - particle correlations and exchange effects beyond the two - particle level .",
    "finally an intimate relation of the quantum potentials to density functional theory has been explored which allows for dft calculations without the need to solve the kohn - sham equations .",
