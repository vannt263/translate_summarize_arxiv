    "it is one of the most important topics in the theory of kleinian group to study the topological structure of deformation spaces of kleinian groups . for such studies , it is indispensable to guarantee that under some conditions , sequences of kleinian groups converge inside the deformation spaces . in other words ,",
    "we need a sufficient condition for a given sequence of kleinian groups to converge algebraically , which should be as general as possible .",
    "in particular , such a sufficient condition for quasi - conformal deformations of geometrically finite kleinian groups interests us most .",
    "the quasi - conformal deformation space of a geometrically finite kleinian group @xmath1 is well understood by virtue of the work of ahlfors , bers , kra , marden and sullivan . to put it more concretely , for a geometrically finite kleinian group @xmath1 ,",

    "therefore , the sufficient condition for the quasi - conformal deformation space should be expressed in terms of sequences of the teichmller spaces .",
    "the first example of such a sufficient condition for convergence is the result of bers in @xcite , which shows that the space of quasi - fuchsian groups lying on the bers slice is relatively compact . on the other hand , in the process of proving the uniformisation theorem for haken manifolds",

    ", thurston listed questions concerning kleinian groups and 3-manifolds .",
    "one of them asks how one can generalise the double limit theorem to the setting of schottky groups .",
    "this question was made into a more concrete conjecture using the notion of masur domain , and then was generalised to function groups .",
    "masur introduced in @xcite an open set in the projective lamination space of the boundary of a handlebody on which the mapping class group of the handlebody acts properly discontinuously .",
    "this open set is what we call the masur domain nowadays .",

    "otal in @xcite first proved that thurston s conjecture is true for rank-@xmath6 schottky space provided that the limit lamination is arational , that is , any component of its complement is simply connected .",
    "canary in @xcite proved the conjecture for some special sequences in schottky space .",

    "<S> we prove that for a compact hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold with boundary , a sequence of convex cocompact hyperbolic metrics , whose conformal structures at infinity diverge to a projective lamination which is doubly incompressible , has a compact closure in the deformation space . as a consequence we solve thurston s conjecture on convergence of function groups affirmatively . </S>"
