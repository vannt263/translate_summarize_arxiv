    "although tunnel fets ( tfets ) were originally proposed for low power applications @xcite , the low on - current ( i@xmath9 ) challenge in tfets has concealed their scaling problem @xcite .",
    "the low i@xmath9 challenge can be solved by increasing the electric field at the tunnel junction ; e.g. by using dielectric engineering @xcite , atomistically thin channels @xcite , or internal polarization @xcite .",
    "however , the scaling challenge is more tricky since the tunneling currents i@xmath9 and i@xmath10 depend on the same device parameters . hence an attempt to decrease i@xmath10 would reduce i@xmath9 and vice versa . in contrast ,",
    "i@xmath9 and i@xmath10 in mosfets are more independent of each other and a channel material with a large bandgap ( or optimized effective mass ) can be used for sub-12 nm channels to suppress the direct source - to - drain tunneling @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a shows the device structure of an inas nanowire ( nw ) tfet with a diameter of 3.4 nm .",
    "the transfer characteristics of the device simulated by the nemo5 tool @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]b with i@xmath10 fixed at 1@xmath11 . in the simulations , we scale @xmath0 down with the channel length ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the results indicate that the inas nw - tfet exhibits a promising performance with long channel lengths ( i.e. @xmath12 9 nm ) , however it completely fails to switch from off- to on - state for the case of @xmath1=6 nm and @xmath0=0.2v ( i.e. i@xmath9/i@xmath13 ) .",
    "roughly , the transmission in the on - state ( @xmath14 ) and off - state ( @xmath15 ) of tfets depends on @xcite : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath1 are the tunneling distances in the on- and off - state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1]a ) respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath4 are the reduced effective mass and the bandgap of the channel material .",
    "the scaling of the channel below 10 nm brings @xmath1 close to @xmath18 which reduces i@xmath9/i@xmath10 significantly .",
    "one apparent solution can be a heterostructure channel where the term @xmath20 is different in ( [ eq : tun1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tun2 ] ) due to different materials used in those regions @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that the presence of band discontinuity and interface states in heterostructures can deteriorate the off - state performance of tfets @xcite .",
    "hence , in this work the homojunction tfets have been considered as a more practical steep subthreshold swing ( @xmath21 ) device .    0.27   for channel lengths from 15 nm to 6 nm which translates into corresponding @xmath0 from 0.5v to 0.2v ( from negf ) .",

    ", it is shown that by using a channel material with optimized @xmath5 and @xmath4 , it is still feasible to obtain an acceptable i@xmath9/i@xmath10 for ultra - scaled tfets ( i.e. i@xmath9/i@xmath25 for @xmath1=6 nm and @xmath0=0.2v ) .",
    "the solution to the scaling problem of tfet is to _ scale down _ @xmath4 of channel material to the smallest possible value to achieve a high i@xmath9 .",
    "of course @xmath4 can not be smaller than @xmath24 , otherwise the channel can not cover and block the tunneling energy window in the off - state .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath5 should _ scale up _ with scaling down the dimensions to decrease i@xmath10 .",
