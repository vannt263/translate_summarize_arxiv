    "in the paper we investigate a stochastic version of a linear volterra equation of the general form @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a linear operator and @xmath5 some mapping . to fix our attention",
    "we shall consider the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) in a separable hilbert space @xmath6 with a scalar product @xmath7 , a norm @xmath8 and a complete orthonormal system @xmath9 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) creates a big class of equations and generalizes heat and wave equations and even linear navier - stokes equation .",
    "we refer to the excellent monograph @xcite for a rich survey .",
    "that kind of volterra equation has been studied by many authors in connection with problems arising in mathematical physics , particularly in viscoelasticity , heat conduction in materials with memory , energy balance and termoviscoelasticity . in order to take into account random fluctuations",
    ", we have to consider the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with random external force .",
    "there are our first considerations concerning numerical treatment of stochastic volterra equations , so we will be grateful for readers remarks and advices .",
    "next , we plan to study the probabilistic features of family of trajectories , take into account different noises and develope numerical schemes for cases where the analytic form of reselvent is not known .",
    "assume that @xmath10 is a probability space with a complete right - continuous filtration and @xmath11 , is a cylindrical wiener process with values in the space @xmath6 .",
    "let us omit , for convenience , the space variable @xmath12 in the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) and introduce the process @xmath11 , instead of function  @xmath5 .",
    "hence , we arrive at the following stochastic volterra equation @xmath13    in this part of the paper we recall some results concerning solutions to ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we restrict our considerations to paper containing so - called resolvent approach to volterra equation . the notion _ resolvent _ or _ fundamental solution _ for volterra equation ( [ eq1 ] ) probably comes from friedman and shinbrot @xcite who studied deterministic volterra integral equations in banach space . for recent survey",
    "we refer again to @xcite . in the sequel",
    "we shall assume that the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is _ well - posed _ , that is , that ( [ eq1 ] ) admits resolvent @xmath14 .    as in deterministic case ,",
    "the _ mild solution _ to the stochastic volterra equation ( [ eq2 ] ) is of the form @xmath15 where @xmath14 , is the resolvent family for the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) determined by the operator @xmath4 and the function @xmath16 . in order to study solution ( [ eq3 ] ) it is enough to consider the stochastic convolution @xmath17 where the stochastic integral is defined according to particular case under consideration .",
    "stochastic volterra equations with resolvent approach have been treated by several authors , see e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite and recently @xcite and @xcite . in the first three papers stochastic volterra equations are studied in connection with viscoelasticity and heat conduction in materials with memory .",
    "the paper @xcite is particularly significant because the authors were the first who have extended the well - known semigroup approach , applied to stochastic differential equations , to the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the resolvent approach is a natural way of extension the semigroup approach which is well - known from the theory of evolution equations .",
    "that approach enables to follow some results and schemes obtained for semigroups .",
    "unfortunately , some results are not valid in our case because resolvent family , @xmath14 , does not satisfy semigroup property .",
    "clment and daprato studied stochastic volterra equation ( [ eq2 ] ) where @xmath4 was self - adjoint , negative operator in the space @xmath6 , such that @xmath18 they considered stochastic volterra equation ( [ eq2 ] ) driven by the noise term @xmath19 of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 was a sequence of real - valued , independent wiener processes .",
    "they assumed that the kernel function @xmath16 is completely positive .",
    "the consequence of completely positiveness of the function @xmath16 is that the solution @xmath22 , to the following equation @xmath23 is nonnegative and nonincreasing for any @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , @xmath25 $ ] . in @xcite regularity of stochastic convolution ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "is studied and hlderianity of the corresponding trajectories is proved .",

    ", the authors considered evolutionary integral equations as appearing in the theory of linear parabolic viscoelasticity forced by white noise .",
    "as earlier , they studied the stochastic convolution that provides regular solutions .",
    "additionally , under suitable assumptions the authors proved that the samples are hlder - continuous . in the remaining part of the paper @xcite ,",
    "the results obtained of that paper were put in a wider perspective by consideration of equations with fractional derivatives .    in the paper @xcite , the authors first proved that @xmath41 is a gaussian random variable for any @xmath38 .",
    "next , the transition function @xmath49 , associated with @xmath50 was considered .",
    "when @xmath50 is the resolvent operator of a stochastic volterra equation , the convolution @xmath51 , is not a markov process .",
    "this fact has the consequence that @xmath52 , is not a semigroup and then it is not possible to associate to @xmath53 a kolmogorov equation .",
    "however , the authors characterized those transition functions such that @xmath54 was differentiable for any uniformly continuous and bounded function @xmath55 .",
    "there are some other regularity results concerning stochastic convolution ( [ eq4 ] ) . in @xcite",
    "was studied the case when the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) was driven by a correlated , spatially homogeneous wiener process @xmath19 with values in the space of real , tempered distributions @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the covariance of @xmath58 and the associated spectral measure be @xmath59 .",
    "we considered existence of the solutions to ( [ eq2 ] ) in @xmath60 and derived conditions under which the solutions to ( [ eq2 ] ) were function - valued and continuous .",
    "in that case , the initial value @xmath61 , @xmath16 is a locally integrable function and @xmath4 is an operator given in the fourier transform form @xmath62 we introduce the following hypothesis .",
    "[ h ]    1 .   for any @xmath63 ,",
    "the equation ( [ eq6 ] ) has exactly one solution @xmath64 locally integrable and measurable with respect to both variables @xmath63 and @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath65 , @xmath66 } \\ ; \\sup_{\\gamma\\geq 0 } |s(t,\\gamma)|<+\\infty .$ ]    for some special cases the function @xmath67 may be found explicitly .",
    "for instance @xmath68 , & ~t\\geq 0,\\hspace{1ex } \\gamma\\geq 0 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    in that case , the resolvent family @xmath14 , determined by the operator @xmath4 and the function @xmath16 is given by the formula ( [ eq7 ] ) and has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 the following results for stochastic convolution are consequences of properties of stochastic integral .    [ 3.4 ] ( @xcite , theorem 2 ) let @xmath19 be a spatially homogeneous wiener process and @xmath71 , the resolvent for the equation ( [ eq2 ] ) . if hypothesis [ h ] holds then the stochastic equation @xmath72 is a well - defined @xmath56-valued process . for each @xmath38",
    "the random variable @xmath73 is generalized , stationary random field on @xmath37 with the spectral measure @xmath74 : @xmath75 \\mu(d\\lambda)\\;.\\ ] ]    [ 3.5 ] ( @xcite , theorem 3 ) assume that hypothesis [ h ] holds .",
    "then the process @xmath73 is function - valued for all @xmath38 if and only if @xmath76 if for some @xmath77 and all @xmath38 , @xmath78 then , for each @xmath38 , @xmath73 is a sample continuous random field .    as we have already written , the volterra equation ( [ eq1 ] ) creates a big class of equations . in particular cases ,",
    "when the operator @xmath4 and the function @xmath16 in the stochastic volterra equation ( [ eq2 ] ) are fixed , there is possible to obtain some additional regularity results .",
    "this is obvious because in particular cases we may use some extra features of solutions to ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , apparently well - known is integrodifferential equation which interpolates heat and wave equations , that is the volterra equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , where @xmath79 , the laplace operator and @xmath80 , where @xmath57 is the gamma function .",
    "recently , deterministic version was studied in detail by fujita @xcite and , independently , by schneider and wyss @xcite and stochastic version of that integrodifferential equation was treated in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall demonstrate numerical results obtained for that equation in the deterministic version and the stochastic one , as well .    in the theory of stochastic volterra equations we are interested not only in the existance , uniqueness and regularity of solutions but in some asymptotics , too .",
    "the paper @xcite is concerned with a limit measure of stochastic volterra equation driven by very general noise in a form of a spatially homogeneous wiener process , with values in the space of tempered distributions @xmath56 .",
    "that paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the limit measure and additionally , it gives a form of any limit measure .",
    "let us summarize the results cited above .",
    "the resolvent operators @xmath14 , corresponding to the volterra equation ( [ eq1 ] ) do not form any semigroup . therefore it is not possible to obtain such strong results as in the case of evolution equations with semigroup generators .",
    "in the case of volterra equations one can not use _ the fractional method of infinite dimensional stochastic calculus_. that method , used for demonstration of continuity with respect to @xmath81 for convolutions with semigroups , enables to obtain only some estimates for the convolutions ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , it is possible only in some special cases , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the volterra equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , in particular its stochastic version ( [ eq2 ] ) , is difficult to study .",
    "it results from the fact that equation ( [ eq1 ] ) contains a wide class of equations .",
    "an essential role is played by the kernel function which , in general , is assumed to be a locally integrable function . as the function @xmath16 and operator @xmath4",
    "determine the resolvent @xmath14 , the type of the function @xmath16 is very important . that is reason why it is so difficult to obtain in a general case the continuity of the convolution ( [ eq4 ] ) and some other theoretical results .",
    "for more general convolution , significant in many applications , like @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is an appropriate process , it becomes even far more difficult .",
    "therefore , in many cases a numerical support of theoretical ( analytical ) considerations is demanded .",
    "we need computations for obtaining estimates in regularity results , choosing some paramenters , choosing function @xmath16 with required properties and for visualization of solutions obtained .",
    "numerical analysis is particularly important when we are not able to obtain analytical results .",
    "additionally , numerical schemes are especially useful for studying the asymptotics .",
    "in this section we construct a scheme for numerical solution of the volterra equation ( [ eq2 ] ) without random part , that is , for @xmath84 we shall consider the case when @xmath4 is the laplace operator . denoting by @xmath85 we can write ( [ eq1a ] ) in the standard form @xmath86    in galerkin method one introduces the complete set of orthonormal functions @xmath87 on the interval @xmath88 $ ] , that is fulfilling conditions @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the scalar product .",
    "the set @xmath91 spans a hilbert space .",
    "the approximate solution is then postulated in the form of an expansion of the unknown true solution in the subspace @xmath92 determined by @xmath93 first basis functions @xmath94 inserting ( [ e3 ] ) into ( [ e2 ] ) we obtain @xmath95 where the function @xmath96 represents the approximation error . from ( [ e5 ] ) we have @xmath97 from ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) it can be written as @xmath98 the coefficient functions @xmath99 are determined by the requirement that the error function @xmath96 has to be orthogonal to the subspace @xmath92 @xmath100 then for @xmath101 the following equations hold @xmath102 \\phi_j(\\tau)d\\tau   \\\\ & - &     \\int_0^t \\left [ \\int_0^\\tau k(x,\\tau , s ) \\sum_{k=1}^n",
