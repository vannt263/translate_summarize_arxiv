    "since the realization of bose - einstein condensate of chromium atoms  @xcite , there have been considerable experimental and theoretical efforts in exploring physical properties of chromium condensates .",
    "owing to the large magnetic dipole moment of chromium atoms , the dipolar effects was first identified experimentally from its expansion dynamics  @xcite . more remarkably , with the precise control of the short - range interaction using feshbach resonance , the @xmath0-wave collapse of a pure dipolar condensate has been observed  @xcite .    in the context of spinor condensates ,",
    "chromium atom has an electronic spin @xmath1 , which provides an ideal platform for exploring even richer quantum phases as compared to those offered by the spin-1 and spin-2 atoms  @xcite .",
    "to date , theorists have mapped out the detailed phase diagram of a spin-3 chromium condensate  @xcite . in particular , a more exotic biaxial nematic phase was also predicted  @xcite .",
    "the possible quantum phases and defects of spin-3 condensates were also classified based on the symmetry considerations  @xcite .",
    "other work on spin-3 chromium condensates includes theoretically studying the strongly correlated states of spin-3 bosons in optical lattices  @xcite and the einstein - de haas effect in chromium condensates  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , all the previous work concerning the ground state and the magnetic properties of spin-3 cr condensates has adopted the so - called single - mode approximation ( sma ) , which assumes that all spin components share a common density profile . however , the studies on spin-1 case show that , for an antiferromagnetic spinor condensate , sma is invalid in the presence of magnetic field for antiferromagnetic spin exchange interaction  @xcite . one would naturally question the validity of sma for spin-3 condensate since the short - range interactions involved here are more complicated than those in spin-1 system .",
    "in the present paper , we study the ground state properties of a spin-3 chromium condensate subject to a uniform axial magnetic field by numerically solving the gross - pitaevskii equations .",
    "we show that even though sma is still valid in the absence of an external magnetic field , it fails when the magnetic field is switched on .",
    "more remarkably , we find that when the undetermined scattering length corresponding to total spin zero channel falls into a certain region , the magnetic field may induce a phase separation like behavior such that the peak densities of certain spin components do not occur at the center of the trapping potential .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ form ] , we introduce our model for numerical calculation . the results for the ground state structure of a spin-3 condensate under an external magnetic field are presented in sec .",

    "the total energy functional of the system , @xmath6 $ ] , can be decomposed into two parts @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being , respectively , the single - body and interaction energies . adopting the summation convention over repeated indices , the single - body energy can be expressed as @xmath10\\psi_{m^{\\prime } } , \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the mass of the atom , the trapping potential @xmath12 is assumed to be axially symmetric with @xmath13 being the trap aspect ratio , @xmath14 are the spin-3 matrices , @xmath15 is the land @xmath16-factor of @xmath17cr atoms , and @xmath18 is bohr magneton .",
    "the collisional interaction between two spin-3 atoms takes the form  @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 projects onto the state with total spin @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the scattering lengths for the combined symmetric channel @xmath21 . for @xmath17cr ,",
    "it was determined experimentally that @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 with @xmath27 being bohr radius  @xcite , while the value of @xmath28 is unknown , and we shall treat it as a free parameter in the results presented below . making use of the relations  @xcite @xmath29 , \\nonumber\\\\ ( { \\mathbf{s}}_1\\cdot{\\mathbf{s}}_2)^2&=&\\sum_s\\frac{\\mathcal{p}_s}{4 } [ s(s+1)-24]^2,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we may replace @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 in eq .",

    "furthermore , @xmath41 is the total density , @xmath42 is the singlet amplitude , and @xmath43 is the density of spin . finally , @xmath44 is the nematic tensor , and to obtain it , we have utilized the relation @xmath45 the nematic tensor was first introduced in the liquid crystal physics as the order parameter @xmath46  @xcite to describe the orientation order of the liquid crystal molecules .",
    "since @xmath46 is hermitian , it can be diagonalized with all eigenvalues @xmath47 ( ordered as @xmath48 ) being real and the corresponding principle axes @xmath49 being mutually orthogonal . unless all three eigenvalues are equal , the systems with two identical eigenvalues are usually refer to as uniaxial nematics , while those with three unequal eigenvalues are biaxial ones .",
    "more importantly , @xmath50 can be determined by performing stern - gerlach experiments along @xmath49 @xcite . as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , different quantum phases originate from the competition of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath46 .",
    "following the discussion of diener and ho  @xcite , we shall characterize phases in a spin-3 cr condensate using the condensate wave functions @xmath4 , singlet amplitude @xmath51 , spin @xmath53 , and nematic tensor @xmath46 .        to simplify the numerical calculations ,",
    "we shall focus on highly oblate trap geometries ( @xmath54 ) such that the condensate can be regarded as quasi - two - dimensional whose motion along the @xmath55-axis is frozen to the ground state of the axial harmonic oscillator .",
    "the condensate wave functions can then be decomposed into @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 being normalized to the total number of atoms @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath59 . after integrating out the @xmath55 variable",
    ", @xmath8 gives an extra constant , while the interaction parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are all rescaled by a factor @xmath64 .",
    "the mean - field wave functions @xmath65 are obtained by minimizing the total energy functional numerically using imaginary time evolution .",
    "we shall focus our study on the cr line @xcite , namely only the scattering length @xmath66 is allowed to changed freely , since experimentally , it is the most relevant case . for all results presented in the present work ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . correspondingly , the dimensionless length unit @xmath70 is adopted in throughout this paper .",
    "we remark that we have neglected the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction energy in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) for simplicity , as in the present work , we are concentrating on investigating how short - range interaction and magnetic field affect the ground state wave function .",
    "the ignorance of dipolar interaction in spinor cr condensate was also justified in ref .",
    "@xcite . moreover",
    ", we have numerically confirmed that for the parameter used in this paper , the dipole - dipole interaction energy is much smaller than short - ranged spin - dependent interaction energy when the condensate is not polarized by the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ phases ] summarizes the main results of this paper . in the left panel of fig . [ phases ] , we present the phase diagram of spin-3 cr condensate in the @xmath66-@xmath71 parameter space , here we have adopted the similar notations for different phases as in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the right panel , we tabulate the major characters of each phase .",
    "we remark that the resolution of phase diagram is limited by step sizes of @xmath66 and @xmath71 when we numerically scan the parameter plane , therefore , it is possible that more details may emerge by reducing the step sizes .",
    "the numerical results indicate that the condensate wave functions can always be expressed as @xmath72 where the density of @xmath73th component @xmath74 is an axially symmetric function and the corresponding phase @xmath75 is a constant independent of the spatial coordinates . in case",
    "the external magnetic field is completely switched off , we find that all wave functions @xmath76 have the same density profile , indicating that the sma is valid for spin-3 condensates in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "we note that this conclusion also holds true for spin-@xmath33 and -@xmath77 condensates .",
    "once the external magnetic field is applied , sma quickly becomes invalid .",
    "more remarkably , as shown in fig . [ phsep ] , when control parameters @xmath66 and @xmath71 fall into the shaded region in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ phases ] , the peak densities of at least one of the spin components among @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 do not occur at the center of the trap , in analogy to the phase separation in a two - component condensate  @xcite . in the absence of magnetic field ,",
    "the system is symmetric under so(3 ) rotation of the spin , and @xmath78 component can be populated .",
    "immediately after we switch on the magnetic field , this so(3 ) symmetry is broken such that @xmath81 spin components are highly populated under a very weak magnetic field . as one continuously increases the magnetic field , the occupation number in @xmath78 component increases with density in the margin of the trap growing faster than that in the center , which induces the phase separation like behavior .",
    "when the population in @xmath78 component dominates , the peak densities of all spin component occur at the center of the trap .",
    "we remark that similar behavior of the wave functions also appears outside the cr line  @xcite .    ) . ]    to gain more insight into the origin of the phase separation like behavior , we consider a homogeneous cr condensate where each spin component has already condensed into the zero momentum mode . the wave function @xmath82 for phase unseparated state",
    "is then replaced by a uniform @xmath83-number @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a real constant and @xmath86 are complex constants .",
    "the ground state can be obtained by minimizing the total energy @xmath87 subject to the normalization condition @xmath88 .",
    "in such a way , we have reproduce the phase diagram in ref .",
    "@xcite . to confirm that those phases are indeed the ground states , we introduce a new set of variables , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , corresponding to , respectively , the real and imaginary parts of the wave function @xmath86 as @xmath91 \\mbox { and } \\zeta_{p=2(3-m)+2}={\\rm im}[\\xi_m].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then construct the hessian matrix @xmath92 $ ] . for a solution to be stable",
    ", the hessian matrix must be positive definite  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ instab ] , we present the unstable region of a homogeneous cr condensate on @xmath66-@xmath71 plane . to obtain it , we have chosen the density to be @xmath93 which is the peak density of the trapped system in our numerical calculations .",
    "one immediately sees that the unstable region of a homogeneous condensate roughly agrees with the phase separation region of the trapped system , which suggests that the possible origin of the phase separation behavior is the instability of the phase unseparated solution .",
    "we emphasize that , unlike in a binary bose - einstein condensate where the emergence of phase separation is determined by the strengths of intra- and inter - species interactions , here for a given scattering length @xmath66 , the phase separation like behavior is induced by the magnetic field .",
    "since the spatial independence of @xmath94 is a necessary condition for sma , it can also be used as a criterion to check the validity of sma . as shown in fig .",
    "[ theta ] , @xmath95 is a constant when @xmath96 ; while immediately after the magnetic field is turned on , @xmath95 becomes spatially dependent .",
    "in addition , the peak value of @xmath95 decreases continuously as one increases the magnetic field until it completely vanish .    in fig .",
    "[ theta ]  ( a ) , @xmath97 becomes zero only after the condensate is completely polarized , while in ( b ) and ( c ) , it vanishes once the system enters the @xmath98 phase .",
    "therefore , using singlet amplitude , we may map out the phase boundaries between @xmath99 and @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath98 , and @xmath102 and @xmath98 .",
    "however , @xmath51 alone is incapable of determining other phase boundaries .",
    "finally , we note that , for @xmath103 , the value of @xmath95 drops much faster with the increasing magnetic field than that corresponding to @xmath104 , as shown below this behavior has a direct impact on the magnetization curve of the system .     for @xmath105 ( a ) , @xmath106 ( b ) , and @xmath107 ( c ) .",
    "in descending order of central value , the lines in ( a ) correspond to the magnetic field ( in units of mg ) @xmath96 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 ; those in ( b ) correspond to @xmath96 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 ; and finally , those in ( c ) correspond to @xmath96 , @xmath116 , @xmath112 , and @xmath117.,width=268 ]     ( solid line ) , @xmath118 ( dashed line ) , @xmath106 ( dash - dotted line ) , and @xmath107 ( dotted line ) . for @xmath103 ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the @xmath120 curves corresponding to different @xmath66 s are indistinguishable.,width=307 ]      we now turn to study magnetic field dependence of the total magnetization . to this end , we define the reduced magnetization as @xmath121 unlike in ref .",
    "@xcite where the total magnetization is conserved , here we allow it to change freely . therefore , the transverse components of the spin , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are always zero .",
    "figure [ mag ] shows the field dependence of the reduced magnetization , which approaches @xmath124 when @xmath71 reaches the saturation field .",
    "we note that , for @xmath104 , the behavior of @xmath125 slightly depends on the value of @xmath66 ; while for @xmath103 , the magnetization curves corresponding to different @xmath66 s become indistinguishable . consequently , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phases ] , the saturation field for the former case is a decreasing function of @xmath66 , while for the latter one , it becomes a constant .",
    "the @xmath66 independence of the magnetization for @xmath103 case can be qualitatively understood as follows .",
    "the scattering length @xmath66 only contributes to the total energy through singlet amplitude @xmath51 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ theta ] , for @xmath103 , @xmath51 vanishes quickly as one increases the magnetic field , such that varying @xmath66 only yields a negligible effect on magnetization curve . with the help magnetization",
    ", we can further identify the phase boundary between @xmath126 and @xmath100 phases .",

    "is denoted in each figure.,width=316 ]      to determine other phase boundaries , we have to rely on the nematic tensor . in fig .",
    "[ nematic ] , we plot typical behavior of the eigenvalues of nematic tensor under different @xmath66 and magnetic fields . as a consequence of the failure of sma ,",
    "@xmath50 s are generally spatially dependent .",
    "however , some of their characteristics obtained under sma remain to be true .",
    "the full ferromagnet ( ff ) phase occurs when the magnetic field exceeds the saturation field such that only @xmath78 component is occupied .",
    "the nematic tensor takes a diagonal form with @xmath130 and @xmath131 . for the wave functions of a@xmath132 and h@xmath132 phases , only two spin states",
    "are populated : other than a common @xmath78 state , @xmath133 and @xmath77 are also occupied for , respectively , a@xmath132 and h@xmath132 phases .",
    "one can easily deduce that the nematic tensors of phases a@xmath132 and h@xmath132 are , respectively , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "since for both cases , @xmath136 is the largest eigenvalue , we have @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are spatially independent .    for g@xmath132 phase , @xmath140 and @xmath80 states",
    "are unoccupied , consequently , @xmath141 becomes a block diagonal matrix with one of the eigenvalues being @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , from numerical results , we find that @xmath136 is always the smaller eigenvalue and @xmath143 , which suggests that g@xmath132 is a biaxial nematic phase with @xmath144 .",
    "all spin components of @xmath102 and @xmath101 phases are populated , they are all are biaxial nematic with three unequal and spatially dependent @xmath145 s .",
    "the principal axes for these phases are also spatially dependents .",
    "the only difference is that for @xmath102 phase we can identify that either @xmath146 or @xmath147 is perpendicular to @xmath55-axis .",
