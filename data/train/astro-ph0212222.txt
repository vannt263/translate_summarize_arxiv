    "the formation of galaxies in these schemes can be successfully analyzed by using numerical simulations which show that , as the systems are assembled , mergers and interactions can trigger star formation with efficiencies that seem to depend mainly on the internal structure of the systems . by using pre - prepared mergers , barnes & hernquist ( 1996 ) showed how the gas component experiences torques originated in the companion , increasing its gas density and triggering a starburst during the orbital decay phase of the satellite .",
    "these starbursts are fed by gas inflows tidally induced if the axisymmetrical character of the potential well is lost during the interaction .",

    "for example , as it has been reported by other authors ( e.g. , petrosian et al .",

    "for the purpose of analysing how @xmath12 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath1 ( defined as @xmath30,where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the redshift of the galaxies in the pair ) , we estimated the number of neighbours within concentric spheres centred at a given galaxy .",

    "the signals are more significant when the centre galaxies belong to the spectral type 4 , but it is statistically equivalent to that measured for central galaxies with @xmath14 .",

    "galaxies situated at larger distances and with greater velocity differences do not show statistically significant signs of enhanced sf with respect to the background .",

    "the resulting field galaxy pair catalog ( fgpc ) comprises 1258 pairs with @xmath0 .    in order to properly assess the significance of the results obtained from the fgp catalog we have defined a sample of control galaxies from the 2df catalog by a monte carlo algorithm that selects for each galaxy pair in the fgp catalog , two galaxies in the field ( i.e. not included in the fgp catalog and not members of the mz group catalog ) with the same redshift range of the galaxy pair with no restriction in their relative distance .",
    "the procedure followed to construct this control catalog assures that it will have the same selection effects than the fgp catalog , and consequently , it can be used to estimate the actual difference between galaxies in pairs and isolated galaxies , in the field , unveiling the effect of the interactions .    for analyzing the spectral type composition of the fgps in comparison with the that of general galaxies in the field we defined five combined categories ( @xmath43 ) according to the combination of spectral type of the galaxies in the pairs .",
