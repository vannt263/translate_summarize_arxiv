    "quantum entanglement , the uniquely quantum mechanical feature of a quantum system as schrdinger emphasized @xcite , is the distinguishing resource of quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "its evolutionary behavior in time is thus of primary importance to the viability and functioning of quantum computing .",
    "many qip candidate systems involve qubits interacting with a quantum field , such as two level atoms ( 2la ) in a cavity .",
    "because of the intrinsically relativistic nature of a quantum field , in that physical information propagates at a finite speed , issues of causality are unavoidably imbued with qip , even though the qubits in popular schemes are likely to move at nonrelativistic speed or remain stationary .",
    "it is of interest to ask whether quantum entanglement can transcend such limitations .",
    "this underlies the frequently mentioned yet often - misconjured notion of  quantum nonlocality \" such as usually associated with the famous epr paper @xcite .",
    "following our two recent work discussing the behavior of quantum entanglement in a relativistic setting , one with a detector ( an object with internal degrees of freedom such as a harmonic oscillator or an atom ) in relativistic motion @xcite and another focusing on the relativistic features of a quantum field mediating two inertial detectors @xcite in this paper we study the conditions whereby quantum entanglement between two causally disconnected detectors ( spacelike separated , outside of each other s light cone ) can be created and if so how it evolves in time . by pushing to extreme conditions",
    "we can appreciate better this unique feature of quantum mechanics assessed in the more complete setting of relativistic quantum fields .",
    "the question in focus here is , whether quantum entanglement between two localized causally disconnected atoms can be created by the vacuum of a common mediating quantum field they both interact with , but not directly with each other .",
    "@xcite affirm such a possibility whereas refs .",
    "@xcite see no such evidence .",
    "these are not contradictory claims because the setups of the problem are not exactly the same .    using the time - dependent perturbation theory ( tdpt ) with extended integration domain",
    ", reznik discovered that a pair of two - level atoms initially in their ground states will become entangled when they are uniformly accelerated back - to - back in the minkowki vacuum of the field , even though in this setup the two atoms are causally disconnected @xcite .",
    "later massar and spindel ( ms ) @xcite considered an exactly solvable model with two unruh - raine - sciama - grove ( u - rsg ) harmonic oscillators @xcite moving in a similar fashion in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions but both in equilibrium with the minkowski vacuum .",
    "they discovered that entanglement can indeed be created , but only in a finite duration of minkowski time after the moment that the distance between the detectors is the minimum .",
    "however , contrary to reznik s perturbative results , ms found that such entanglement creation process does not occur in perturbative regime . in our assessment , since ms were looking at the late - time steady - state behavior ( where  the detectors are in equilibrium with the unruh heat bath \" @xcite ) , their result can not be compared with reznik s tdpt result , which corresponds to early - time behavior of the detectors or atoms .    to resolve the difference and understand the discrepancy our present investigation adopts the physical system used in @xcite to a situation similar to that considered in @xcite or @xcite",
    ". taking advantage of the existence of exact solutions to the model under study we can perform a thorough analysis and follow the system s evolution through their whole history which enables us to identify the conditions ( in the motion of the two atoms ) , the approximations invoked ( e.g. , time dependent perturbation theory used in @xcite ) and the parameter ranges where quantum entanglement may be generated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model and describe the setup in the problem . in sec .",
    "iii we derive explicitly the expression for the cross correlators , and discuss their evolutionary behavior . using these correlators",
    "we examine the exact dynamics of quantum entanglement in different conditions in sec .",
    "we then give a comparison between the exact entanglement dynamics and the one from the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) of the truncated system .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with some discussions . in appendix",
    "a we give the expression for some elements of rdm from a first order time - dependent perturbation theory , and discuss some subtleties in the regularization and integration domain . in appendix",
    "b we derive explicitly the rdm of the two truncated detectors in an eigen - energy representation .",
    "consider two identical , localized but spacelike separated unruh - dewitt detectors , whose internal degrees of freedom @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupled to a relativistic massless quantum scalar field as described in @xcite , undergoing uniform acceleration in opposite directions as described in @xcite .",
    "the action is given by eq.(1 ) in @xcite , but now the trajectories of the detectors are chosen as @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , parametrized by their proper times @xmath4 and proper acceleration @xmath5 . in this setup",
    "the detectors never enter into the light cone of each other , so they can not exchange classical information and energy .",
    "suppose the initial state of the combined system is a direct product of the minkowski vacuum of the field and a separable state of the detectors in the form of a product of the gaussian states with minimum uncertainty for each free detector , represented by the wigner function @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the conjugate momenta of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the squeeze parameters .",
    "then the quantum state of the combined system is always gaussian during the evolution since the action is quadratic . in this case",
    "the separability of the two detectors can be well defined by the covariance matrix of the detectors throughout their history .",
    "we study the entanglement dynamics by calculating the exact evolution of the two - point functions or correlators , as in @xcite . to compare with the results in @xcite in the time - dependent perturbation theory regime",
    ", we will show the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) of the two detectors in an eigen - energy representation , then truncate the energy spectra of the detectors to include only their ground states and first excited states so that they look like two two - level systems . using the explicit expressions for the elements of the rdm of the truncated system we can compare the criteria of separability in the dynamics of the exact and truncated systems .",
    "when the detectors are in a gaussian state the rdm obtained from integrating over the quantum field is fully determined by the two - point functions or correlators of the detectors . if we could obtain the time evolution of each correlator of the detectors , we have the full dynamics of this model .    by virtue of the factorized initial state for the combined system and the linear interaction , each correlator splits into two parts as @xmath11 .",
    "the a - part describes the evolution of the initial zero - point fluctuation in the detector , while the v - part accounts for the response to the vacuum fluctuations of the field .",
    "since the quantum field effects such as retardation from one detector will never reach the other in the setup of this paper , no higher order correction from mutual influences is needed .",
    "so in this setup the expressions for the self correlators of a single detector in @xcite and @xcite are actually exact , and the v - part of the self correlators there can be directly applied here with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the a - part of the self correlators for @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be different if we take different values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the initial state @xmath17 , but the calculation is still straightforward .",
    "the remaining task is to calculate the cross correlators between the two detectors .",
    "the a - part of the cross correlators always vanishes since the initial state @xmath17 is factorizable for detectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the initial moment and no retarded mutual influence between them ever arises after the coupling is switched on .",
    "so the cross correlator @xmath18 contains contributions solely from the v - part , or vacuum fluctuations of the field .",
    "explicitly , it is obtained by performing the following two - dimensional integration , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the coupling constant between each detector and the field , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the natural frequency of each detector , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the durations of interaction from the initial moments @xmath25 and @xmath26 when the coupling with the field is switched on to the proper times @xmath4 and @xmath27 of detectors @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , and @xmath28 is the positive frequency wightman function of the massless scalar field , eq . @xmath29 . in appendix",

    "second , while in both cases quantum entanglement between the detectors can be created after the moment in minkowski time that the distance between the detectors is a minimum , the lifetimes of the created entanglement in our case are usually much longer than the natural period of the detectors , in contrast to the short lifetimes of entanglement in ms s ( 1 + 1)d results .",
    "finally , in our ( 3 + 1)d case entanglement creation is totally suppressed in the strong coupling regime and can manifest in the weak coupling limit , while in ms s result entanglement generation is a non - pertubative phenomena so there is no entanglement creation in their weak coupling regime .",
