    "it is abundantly clear that there are mass discrepancies in the universe . whether these imply the existence of invisible mass or a modification of dynamical laws is less clear .",
    "either way , remarkable new physics must be involved .    the persistent flatness of rotation curves at radii well beyond the point where the observed baryon distribution predicts a declining @xmath0 was one of the key observations that convinced us of the need for dark matter ( e.g. , bosma 1981 ; rubin  1982 ) . while the inference of dark matter is a perfectly natural one , strictly speaking the data merely indicate the presence of mass discrepancies .",
    "this can mean either dark matter or a breakdown in the equations relating mass and dynamics . here",
    "i briefly review the application of rotation curves as a test of each of these cases in turn .",
    "fabry - perot data from blais - ouellette  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the declining solid line illustrates the contribution of the baryons ( stars + gas ) ; the dashed line that of the dark matter .",
    "these illustrate the combination of conventional components required to match the mond fit ( upper solid line).,width=340 ]    in principle , rotation curves provide an excellent probe of the radial force law in galaxies .",
    "[ n2403 ] shows an example of an extended rotation curve . in practice ,",
    "a number of issues complicate the use of rotation curves to constrain the mass distribution .",
    "these fall into two broad categories : issues concerning data quality ( the accuracy with which the potential is traced , e.g. , swaters  2003 ; de blok  2003 ) and the degeneracy of modeling dark and baryonic components .",
    "while there are always cases for which the data can be improved , the literature contains many excellent rotation curves that have been consistently measured by independent observers using different techniques . yet even for perfect data",
    ", there is a terrible ambiguity between dark and luminous mass .",
    "the stellar mass is only known as well as the mass - to - light ratio @xmath1 , and the inferred dark matter distribution can change dramatically for different @xmath1 .",
    "this effect is much stronger than the uncertainties in the rotation curve itself .",
    "for any individual galaxy , the degeneracy between dark and luminous mass is hard to lift .",
    "however , galaxies as a population obey a number of scaling relations ( e.g. , persic & salucci 1988 ) .",
    "we can test a variety of prescriptions for @xmath1 ; presumably the one that minimizes the scatter in relations like the baryonic tully - fisher relation is the one that comes closest to the truth .",
    "mcgaugh ( 2005 ) considered a variety of prescriptions : scaling @xmath1  as a fraction of maximum disk @xmath2 ; relative to population synthesis models @xmath3 ; and relative to the mass discrepancy  acceleration relation ( the empirical version of mond ) : @xmath4 .",
    "these @xmath1  are shown as a function of color in fig .",

    "* right panel : * @xmath5  ( mond ) . the population model of bell  ( 2003 ) is shown as a line in all three panels.,width=453 ]    the prescription that is most consistent with stellar population synthesis models is @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , this is more consistent with such models than the models are with themselves , in that a realistic amount of scatter is built in .",
    "the case of @xmath6 also minimizes the scatter in the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( fig .",
    "[ btf ] ) and , by construction , in the mass discrepancy  acceleration relation .",
    "the upshot of this is that * the stellar mass - to - light ratio is well determined*.     ( line ) .",
    "this is a considerably larger dynamic range than has been available until recently .",
    "the box in the left panel illustrates the range over which most tully - fisher work has been done.,width=415 ]",
    "once @xmath1  is determined , the dark matter distribution follows .",

    "[ dmhisto ] , one is struck more by the over all similarity . at a crude level ,",
    "the data are consistent with all galaxies living in identical dark matter halos .",
    "presumably , there is some mass spectrum of halos , but that is not obvious from these data .",
    ", equivalent to a dark matter distribution whose density falls as @xmath8 .",
    "this is a good representation of the mean of the data for @xmath9 kpc .",

    "also shown ( dotted line ) is the profile suggested by navarro  ( 2004 ) , which is virtually indistinguishable from nfw .",
    "* right panel : * the variation of the mean velocity of the dark matter with different choices of mass estimator for the stars .",
    "the mean dark matter velocity increases as stellar mass declines , but hardly intersects with the region predicted by @xmath11cdm  ( horizontal lines ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    remarkably , the scatter in the inferred rotation curves is minimized for the case of @xmath7 .",
    "the scatter in the dark matter component in this case is comparable to that expected in cdm simulations ( bullock  2001 ) .",
    "a fit to these data yield a line @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the intercept @xmath15 depends on the choice of mass - to - light ratio , as tracked by the centroid of the distribution in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ dmhisto ] .",
    "it is striking that the slope @xmath16 .",
    "this slope in velocity space corresponds to a density distribution @xmath17 , which is the inner slope of an nfw halo .",
    "this sheds no light on the cusp / core controversy , as the data here do not probe the inner kpc where that problem arises ( de blok 2004 ) .",
    "it does , however , tell us about the density and structure of halos at intermediate radii .",
    "what we observe is a continually rising halo rotation curve .",
    "we do not see the flat portion of an isothermal halo : the observed flat velocity is the combination of a declining baryonic component and a rising dark halo component . that @xmath18  remains roughly constant",
    "while its components vary with radius [ @xmath19 remains a curious puzzle .",
    "the slope of the rising halo @xmath20 is consistent with the expectation for an nfw halo .",
    "however , the amplitude is wrong , and the @xmath16 slope persists rather too far . over this range of radii",
    ", we expect to see significant curvature in the halo rotation curves ( fig .  [ vhqdv ] ) .",
    "presumably , galaxies reside in halos of a variety of different mass halos , so perhaps we are merely seeing the locus of rising portions of the halo rotation curves .",
    "if this is the case , it is rather odd that we see so much of the rise but so little of the turn - over .",
    "the observed amplitude of @xmath20 poses a serious problem .",
    "cdm predicts velocities that are too high .",
    "this holds over the entire observed range of radii , irrespective of the detailed shape of the profile .    for vanilla @xmath11cdm  parameters ( tegmark  2004 ) , we expect the dark matter velocity to be higher than observed by @xmath21 dex .",
    "this is a large effect . in terms of cosmological parameters , the observations ( for @xmath7 )",
    "imply @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a modified shape parameter ( mcgaugh , barker , & de blok 2003 ) .",
    "in contrast , vanilla @xmath11cdm  has @xmath24 .",
    "reconciling this difference would require large changes to basic cosmological parameters .",
    "this does not seem plausible",
    ". it may be sufficient to suppress the power spectrum on small scales , but it is quite a stretch to maintain consistency with other constraints .",
    "the most obvious solution is to reduce the stellar mass ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "[ vhqdv ] shows how the centroid of the data varies with different scalings of @xmath1 . the data",
    "just barely enter the region predicted by @xmath11cdm  in the limit @xmath26 , and then only for rather lower mass halos than we typically associate with bright galaxies ( which are well represented in this sample ) .",
    "we are not at liberty to decrease @xmath1  this much , as constraints on the imf no longer permit arbitrarily small @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the scatter in the baryonic tully - fisher and mass discrepancy  acceleration relations becomes unacceptably large for @xmath27 ( mcgaugh 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "consequently , no matter how one chooses to look at the problem , and irrespective of the details of the slope of the halo ( cusp or core ) , * the velocity attributable to dark matter is significantly smaller than predicted by @xmath11cdm . *",
    "in stark contrast to the situation for cdm , mond fits rotation curves well ( fig .",
    "[ resid ] ) .",
    "that is does so is well established ( sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ) .",
    "what this means is open to debate .      like most astronomers",
    ", i ignored mond for a long time , thinking it so unlikely as to not warrant consideration .",
    "i was obliged to reconsider when the fine - tuning problems with dark matter became severe ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998a ) , and the predictions of mond came true in my data .",
    "milgrom ( 1983 ) made a series of specific predictions for low surface brightness galaxies , all of which were subsequently realized ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998b ) .",
    "correlates with acceleration @xmath28 . *",
    "top panel : * data : points with formal errors in velocity @xmath29 are shown as solid points , those with greater uncertainty as open points .",
    "the scatter is minimized ( by construction ) for mond mass - to - light ratios , but the correlation persists for any plausible mass - to - light ratio ( mcgaugh 2004 ) . * middle panel : * the feedback model of van den bosch & dalcanton ( 2000 ) , which is to date the only attempt to quantitatively explain this aspect of the data with dark matter . *",
    "bottom panel : * the ` same halo ' model of mcgaugh & de blok ( 1998a ) illustrating the natural expectation for exponential disks residing in nfw halos sans feedback . , width=340 ]    this must mean something .",
    "the question , of course , is what .",
    "there is a widespread myth that mond is somehow designed to fit rotation curves , and is guaranteed to do so .",
    "this is demonstrably false ( de blok & mcgaugh 1998 ) .",
    "quite the contrary , mond fits have only one fit parameter , @xmath1 , and are considerably better constrained than fits with dark halos .",
    "this is a non - trivial fact : if you write down the wrong force law , it fails ( and fails badly ) quite quickly .",
    "many other modifications of gravity have been attempted , and suffered just such a fate . that mond works as well as it does suggests that it is the correct _ effective _ force law , at least in spiral galaxies .",
    "we can rephrase mond as a purely empirical relation ( mcgaugh 2005 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the mass discrepancy is correlated with acceleration ( fig .",
    "[ mddatanfw ] ) .",
    "this mass discrepancy  acceleration relation is present in the data , whether we call it mond or not .",
    "as such , it is an important empirical fact which we need to understand .",
    "i have devoted a good deal of time over the past decade trying to understand this relation in conventional terms .",
    "i have not succeeded .",
    "there are a few claims by others to have done so , the most serious being that of van den bosch & dalcanton ( 2000 ) .",
    "their model is plotted together with the data in fig .",
    "[ mddatanfw ] , as is a model i would consider natural for cdm .",
    "many models are possible with dark matter , which provides no unique null hypothesis : there is a wide variety of things rotation curves might reasonably be expected to do . in mond , there is precisely one thing rotation curves can do , and that is what they do . philosophically , it is hard to imagine a stranger situation : * why should dark matter look like mond ? *    aguirre , a. , schaye , j. , quataert , e.  2001 , apj , 561 , 550 begeman , k.g . , broeils , a.h . , & sanders , r.h . , 1991 , mnras , 249 , 523 bell , e.f . ,",
