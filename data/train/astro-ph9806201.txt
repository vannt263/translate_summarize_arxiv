    "in the present almost frenetic rate of advance of cosmology it is useful to be reminded that the big news this year is the establishment of evidence , by two groups ( @xcite , @xcite ) , of detection of the relativistic curvature of the redshift - magnitude relation .",
    "the measurement was proposed in the early 1930s .",
    "compare this to the change in the issues in particle physics since 1930 .",
    "the slow evolution of cosmology has allowed ample time for us to lose sight of which elements are reasonably well established and which have been adopted by default , for lack of more reasonable - looking alternatives .",
    "thus i think it is appropriate to devote a good part of my assigned space to a discussion of what might be included in the standard model for cosmology .",
    "i then comment on additions that may come out of work in progress .",
    "main elements of the model are easily listed : in the large - scale average the universe is close to homogeneous , and has expanded in a near homogeneous way from a denser hotter state when the 3  k cosmic background radiation was thermalized .    the standard cosmology assumes conventional physics , including general relativity theory .",
    "this yields a successful account of the origin of the light elements , at expansion factor @xmath0 .",
    "light element formation tests the relativistic relation between expansion rate and mass density , but this is not a very searching probe . the cosmological tests discussed in  3 could considerably improve the tests of general relativity .",
    "the model for the light elements seems to require that the mass density in baryons is less than that needed to account for the peculiar motions of the galaxies .",
    "it is usually assumed that the remainder is nonbaryonic ( or acts that way ) .",
    "our reliance on hypothetical dark matter is an embarrassment ; a laboratory detection would be exceedingly welcome .    in the past decade",
    "many discussions assumed the einstein - de  sitter case , in which there are negligibly small values for the curvature of sections of constant world time and einstein s cosmological constant @xmath1 ( or a term in the stress - energy tensor that acts like one ) .",
    "this is what most of would have chosen if we were ordering .",
    "but the evidence from the relative velocities of the galaxies has long been that the mass density is less than the einstein - de  sitter value @xcite , and other more recent observations , notably the curvature of the redshift - magnitude relation ( @xcite , @xcite ) , point in the same direction .",
    "now there is increasing interest in the idea that we live in a universe in which the dominant term in the stress - energy tensor acts like a decaying cosmological constant ( @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "this is not part of the standard model , of course , but as discussed in  3 the observations seem to be getting close to useful constraints on space curvature and @xmath1 .",
    "we have good reason to think structure formation on the scale of galaxies and larger was a result of the gravitational growth of small primeval departures from homogeneity , as described by general relativity in linear perturbation theory .",
    "the adiabatic cold dark matter ( acdm ) model gives a fairly definite and strikingly successful prescription for the initial conditions for this gravitational instability picture , and the acdm model accordingly is widely used in analyses of structure formation .",
    "but we can not count it as part of the standard model because there is at least one viable alternative , the isocurvature model mentioned in  3.3 .",
    "observations in progress likely will eliminate at least one , perhaps establish the other as a good approximation to how the galaxies formed , or perhaps lead us to something better .",
    "the observational basis for this stripped - down standard model is reviewed in references @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "i comment on some issues now under discussion .",
    "pietronero @xcite argues that the evidence from redshift catalogs and deep galaxy counts is that the galaxy distribution is best described as a scale - invariant fractal with dimension @xmath2 .",
    "others disagree ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "i am heavily influenced by another line of argument : it is difficult to reconcile a fractal universe with the isotropy observed in deep surveys ( examples of which are illustrated in figs . 3.7 to 3.11 in @xcite and are discussed in connection with the fractal universe in pp . 209 - 224 in @xcite ) .",
    "-1.0truecm    fig .",
    "1 shows angular positions of particles in three ranges of distance from a particle in a fractal realization with dimension @xmath3 in three dimensions . at @xmath3",
    "the expected number of neighbors scales with distance @xmath4 as @xmath5 , and i have scaled the fraction of particles plotted as @xmath6 to get about the same number in each plot .",
    "the fractal is constructed by placing a stick of length @xmath7 , placing on either end the centers of sticks of length @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , with random orientation , and iterating to smaller and larger scales .",
    "the particles are placed on the ends of the shortest sticks in the clustering hierarchy .",
    "this construction with @xmath10 ( and some adjustments to fit the galaxy three- and four - point correlation functions ) gives a good description of the small - scale galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "the fractal in fig .  1",
    ", with @xmath3 , the dimension pietronero proposes , does not look at all like deep sky maps of galaxy distributions , which show an approach to isotropy with increasing depth .",
    "this can not happen in a scale - invariant fractal : it has no characteristic length .",
    "a characteristic clustering length for galaxies may be expressed in terms of the dimensionless two - point correlation function defined by the joint probability of finding galaxies centered in the volume elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 at separation @xmath13 , dp = n^2[1+_gg(r)]dv_1dv_2 .",
    "[ eq : xigg ] the galaxy two - point function is quite close to a power law , = ( r_o / r)^,= 1.77 , 10hr10 , [ eq : xiggparameters ] where the clustering length is r_o=4.50.5 , and the hubble parameter is h_o=100h^-1 ^ -1 .",
    "the rms fluctuation in galaxy counts in a randomly placed sphere is @xmath14 at sphere radius @xmath15  mpc , to be compared to the hubble distance ( at which the recession velocity approaches the velocity of light ) , @xmath16 mpc .",
    "the isotropy observed in deep sky maps is consistent with a universe that is inhomogeneous but spherically symmetric about our position .",
    "there are tests , as discussed by paczyski and piran @xcite .",
    "for example , we have a successful theory for the origin of the light elements as remnants of the expansion and cooling of the universe through @xmath17 mev @xcite .",
    "if there were a strong radial matter density gradient out to the hubble length we could be using the wrong local entropy per baryon , based on conditions at the hubble length where the cbr came from , yet the theory seems to be successful .",
    "but to most people the compelling argument is that distant galaxies look like equally good homes for observers like us : it would be startling if we lived in one of the very few close to the center of symmetry .",
    "mandelbrot @xcite points out that other fractal constructions could do better than the one in fig . 1 .",
    "his example does have more particles in the voids defined by the strongest concentrations in the sky , but it seems to me to share the distinctly clumpy character of fig .",
    "1 . it would be interesting to see a statistical test .",
    "a common one expands the angular distribution in a given range of distances in spherical harmonics , a_l^m = d()y_l^m ( ) , [ eq : alm ] where @xmath18 is the surface mass density as a function of direction @xmath19 in the sky .",
    "the integral becomes a sum if the fractal is represented as a set of particles .",
    "a measure of the angular fluctuations is e_l = l_-l < m < l |a_l^m|^2/(a_0 ^ 0)^2 , where ^2/^2 - 1 = _ l 1 e_l / l . [ eq : variance ] in the approximation of the sum as an integral @xmath20 is the contribution to the variance of the angular distribution per logarithmic interval of @xmath21 . it will be recalled that the zeros of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath22 are at separation @xmath23 in the shorter direction , except where the zeros crowd together near the poles and @xmath22 is close to zero .",
    "thus @xmath20 is the variance of the fractional fluctuation in density across the sky on the angular scale @xmath24 and in the chosen range of distances from the observer .",
    "i can think of two ways to define the dimension of a fractal that produces a close to isotropic sky .",
    "first , each octant of a full sky sample has half the diameter of the full sample , so one might define @xmath25 by the fractional departure of the mean density within each octant from the mean in the full sample , ( e_2)^1/2~2 ^ 3-d - 1.[eq : e_2 ] thus in fig .",
    "1 , with @xmath3 , the quadrupole anisotropy @xmath26 is on the order of unity .",
    "second , one can use the idea that the mean particle density varies with distance @xmath13 from a particle as @xmath27 .",
    "then the small angle ( large @xmath21 ) limber approximation to the angular correlation function @xmath28 is @xcite 1+w(=/l)~^l e_l dl / l _ 0 ^ 1du [ u^2 + ( /l)^2]^-(3-d)/2 . [",
    "eq : e_l ] to find @xmath20 differentiate with respect to @xmath21 . at @xmath3",
    "this gives @xmath29 : the surface density fluctuations are independent of scale . at @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the x - ray background fluctuates by about @xmath32 at @xmath33 , or @xmath34 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath35 in the fractal model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_l ] ) .",
    "the universe is not exactly homogeneous , but it seems to be remarkably close to it on the scale of the hubble length",
    ". it would be interesting to know whether there is a fractal construction that allows a significantly larger value of @xmath36 for given @xmath20 than in this calculation .",
    "expansion that preserves homogeneity requires that the mean rate of change of separation of pairs of galaxies with separation @xmath4 varies as the hubble law , v = hr.[eq : hl ] the redshift - distance relation for type ia supernovae gives an elegant demonstration of this relation ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "arp ( @xcite , @xcite ) points out that such precision tests do not directly apply to the quasars , and he finds fascinating evidence in sky maps for associations of quasars with galaxies at distinctly lower redshifts .",
    "but there is a counterargument , along lines pioneered by bergeron @xcite , as follows .",
    "a quasar spectrum may contain absorption lines characteristic of a cloud of neutral atomic hydrogen at surface density @xmath37 atoms  @xmath38 .",
    "if this absorption system is at redshift @xmath39 a galaxy at the same redshift is close enough that there is a reasonable chance observing it , and with high probability an optical image does show a galaxy close to the quasar and at the redshift of the absorption lines ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "also , when a galaxy image appears in the sky close to a quasar at higher redshift then with high probability the quasar spectrum has absorption lines at the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "we have good evidence the galaxy is at the distance indicated by its redshift .",
    "we can be sure the quasar is behind the galaxy : the quasar light had to have passed through the galaxy to have produced the absorption lines .",
    "if quasars were not at their cosmological distances we ought to have examples of a quasar appearing close to the line of sight to a lower redshift galaxy and without the characteristic absorption lines produced by the gas in and around the galaxy .",
    "arp s approach to this issue is important , but i am influenced by what seems to be this direct and clear interpretation of the bergeron effect , that indicates redshift is a good measure of distance for quasars as well as galaxies .      in the relativistic friedmann - lematre cosmological model the wavelength of a freely propagating photon",
    "is stretched in proportion to the expansion factor from the epoch of emission to detection : 1+z=_obs_em = a_obsa_em .",
    "[ eq : redshift ] the first expression defines the redshift @xmath40 in terms of the ratio of observed wavelength to wavelength at emission . the cosmological expansion parameter @xmath41 is proportional to the mean distance between conserved particles .    the most direct evidence that the redshift is a result of expansion is the thermal spectrum of the cbr @xcite . in a tired light model in a static universe",
    "the photons suffer a redshift that is proportional to the distance travelled , but in the absence of absorption or emission the photon number density remains constant . in this case",
    "a significant redshift makes an initially thermal spectrum distinctly not thermal and inconsistent with the measured cbr spectrum .",
    "one could avoid this by assuming the mean free path for absorption and emission of cbr photons is much shorter than the hubble length , so relaxation to thermal equilibrium is much faster than the rate of distortion of the spectrum by the redshift .",
    "but this opaque universe is quite inconsistent with the observation of radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath42 at cbr wavelengths .",
    "that is , the universe can not have an optical depth large enough to preserve a thermal cbr spectrum in a tired light model . in the standard world model",
    "the expansion has two effects : it redshifts the photons , as @xmath43 , and it dilutes the photon number density , as @xmath44 .",
    "the result is to cool the cbr while keeping its spectrum thermal .",
    "thus the expanding universe allows a self - consistent picture : the cbr was thermalized in the past , at a time when when the universe was denser , hotter , and optically thick .",
    "i have not encountered any serious objection to this argument ; the issue is the expansion factor . in the relativistic friedmann - lematre model the expansion of the universe traces back at least as far as redshift @xmath0 , when the light elements formed in observationally reasonable amounts @xcite . in the model of arp _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the expansion and cooling traces back to a redshift only moderately greater than the largest observed values , @xmath45 , when there would have been a burst of creation of matter and radiation followed by rapid clearing of the dust that thermalized the radiation . the arp _",
    "_ picture for the origin of the light elements has not been widely debated .",
    "if it were agreed that it is viable then a choice between this and the friedmann - lematre model would depend on other tests , such as the angular fluctuations in the cbr , as discussed next .    -1.0truecm",
    "the tests in table 1 are organized in four categories : spacetime geometry , galaxy peculiar velocities , structure formation , and early universe physics .",
    "i offer grades for three sets of parameter choices .",
    "as the tests improve we may learn that one narrowly constrained set of values of the cosmological parameters receives consistent passing grades , or else that we have to cast our theoretical net more broadly .      in the relativistic friedmann - lematre cosmological model the mean spacetime geometry ( ignoring curvature fluctuations produced by local mass concentrations in galaxies and systems of galaxies )",
    "may be represented by the line element ds^2 = dt^2 - a(t)^2 , [ eq : lineelement ] where the expansion rate satisfies the equation h^2 = ( aa ) ^2 = 83 g + 3 , which might be approximated as h^2= h_o^2[(1+z)^3 + ( 1+z)^2 + ] .",
    "[ eq : cos_pars ] the last equation defines the fractional contributions to the square of the present hubble parameter @xmath46 by matter , space curvature , and the cosmological constant ( or a term in the stress - energy tensor that acts like one ) . the time - dependence assumes pressureless matter and constant @xmath1 .",
    "other notations are in the literature ; a common practice in the particle physics community to add the matter and @xmath1 terms in a new density parameter , @xmath47 .",
    "i prefer keeping them separate , because the observational signatures of @xmath19 and @xmath48 can be quite different .    by 1930",
    "people understood how one would test the space - time geometry in these equations , and as i mentioned there is at last direct evidence for the detection of one of the effects , the curvature of the relation between redshift and apparent magnitude ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "as indicated in line 1b , the measured curvature is inconsistent with the einstein - de  sitter model in which @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the measurements also disagree with a low density model with @xmath51 , though the size of the discrepancy approaches the size of the error flags , so i assign a weaker failing grade for this case .",
    "the measurements are magnificent .",
    "the issue yet to be thoroughly debated is whether the type ia supernovae observed at redshifts @xmath52 are drawn from essentially the same population as the nearer ones .    in a previous volume in this series",
    "krauss @xcite discusses the time - scale issue .",
    "stellar evolution ages and radioactive decay ages do not rule out the einstein - de  sitter model , within the still considerable uncertainties in the measurements , but the longer expansion time scales of the low @xmath19 models certainly relieve the problem of interpretation of the measurements .",

    "the sneia redshift - magnitude relation seems best fit by @xmath56 , @xmath57 , a possibly significant discrepancy .",
    "a serious uncertainty in the analysis of the lensing rate is the number density of early - type galaxies in the high surface density branch of the fundamental plane at luminosities @xmath58 , the luminosity of the milky way .",
    "if further tests confirm an inconsistency of the lensing rate and the redshift - magnitude relation the lesson may be that @xmath48 is dynamical , rolling to zero , as ratra &  quillen @xcite point out .",
    "the relation between the mass density parameter @xmath19 and the gravitational motions of the galaxies is an issue rich enough for a separate category in table 1 .",
    "it has been known for the past decade that if galaxies were fair tracer of mass then the small - scale relative velocities of the galaxies would imply that @xmath19 is well below unity @xcite .",
    "if the mass distribution were smoother than that of the galaxies , the smaller mass fluctuations would require a larger mean mass density to gravitationally produce the observed galaxy velocities .",
    "davis , efstathiou , frenk &  white @xcite were the first to show that such a biased distribution of galaxies relative to mass readily follows in numerical n - body simulations of the growth of structure , and the demonstration has been repeated in considerable detail ( @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this is a serious argument for the biasing effect . but here are three arguments for the proposition that galaxies are fair tracers of mass for the purpose of estimating @xmath19 .",
    "first , in many numerical simulations dwarf galaxies are less strongly clustered than giants .",
    "this is reasonable , for if much of the mass were in the voids defined by the giant galaxies , as required if @xmath59 , then surely there would be remnants of the suppressed galaxy formation in the voids , irregular galaxies that bear the stigmata of a hostile early environment .",
    "the first systematic redshift survey showed that the distributions of low and high luminosity galaxies are strikingly similar @xcite .",
    "no survey since , in 21-cm , infrared , ultraviolet , or low surface brightness optical , has revealed a void population . there is a straightforward interpretation : the voids are nearly empty because they contain little mass .",
    "second , one can use the galaxy two - point correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xigg ] ) and the mass autocorrelation function @xmath60 from a numerical simulation of structure formation to define the bias function b(r , t ) = ^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : bias ] in numerical simulations @xmath61 typically varies quite significantly with separation and redshift @xcite .",
    "that is , the galaxies give a biased representation of the statistical character of the mass distribution in a typical numerical simulation .",
    "the issue is whether the galaxies , or the models , or both , are biased representations of the statistical character of the real mass distribution .",
    "what particularly strikes me is the observation that the low order galaxy correlation functions have some simple properties .",
    "the galaxy two - point function is close to a power law over some three orders of magnitude in separation ( eq . [ eq : xiggparameters ] ) .",
    "the value of the power law index @xmath62 changes little back to redshift @xmath63 . within the clustering length",
    "@xmath64 the higher order correlation functions are consistent with a power law fractal .",
    "a reasonable presumption is that the regularity exhibited by the galaxies reflects a like regularity in the mass , because galaxies trace mass .",
    "i am impressed by the power of the numerical simulations , and believe they reflect important aspects of reality , but do not think we should be surprised if they do not fully represent other aspects , such as relatively fine details of the mass distribution .",
    "-1.0truecm    the third argument deals with the idea that blast waves or radiation from the formation of a galaxy may have affected the formation of nearby galaxies , producing scale - dependent bias . in this case",
    "the apparent value of the density parameter derived from gravitational motions within systems of galaxies on the assumption galaxies trace mass would be expected to vary with increasing scale , approaching the true value when derived from relative motions on scales larger than the range of influence of a forming galaxy .",
    "2 shows a test .",
    "the abscissa at the entry for clusters of galaxies is the comoving radius of a sphere that contains the mass within the abell radius .",
    "the estimates at larger scales are plotted at approximate values of the radius of the sample . if it were not for the last two points at the right - hand side of fig .  2",
    ", one might conclude that the apparent density parameter is increasing to the true value @xmath65 at @xmath66  mpc . but considering the last two points , and the sizes of the error flags , it is difficult to see any evidence for scale - dependent bias .",
    "i assign a strongly negative grade for the einstein - de  sitter model in line 2a in table  1 , based on galaxy motions on relatively small scales , because biasing certainly is required if @xmath49 and i have argued there is no evidence for it . the more tentative grade in line 2b",
    "is based on fig .  2 :",
    "the apparent value of the density parameter does not seem to scale with depth .",
    "the friedmann - lematre model is unstable to the gravitational growth of departures from a homogeneous mass distribution .",
    "the present large - scale homogeneity could have grown out of primeval chaos , but the initial conditions would be absurdly special .",
    "that is , the friedmann - lematre model requires that the present structure  the clustering of mass in galaxies and systems of galaxies  grew out of small primeval departures from homogeneity .",

    "3 is that at least two families of models , with different relations between @xmath19 and the value of @xmath21 at the peak , come close to the measurements of the cbr fluctuation spectrum , within the still substantial uncertainties .",
    "an estimate of @xmath19 from the cbr anisotropy measurements thus may depend on the choice of the model for structure formation .",
    "programs of measurement of @xmath78 in progress should be capable of distinguishing between the adiabatic and isocurvature models , even given the freedom to adjust the shape of @xmath79 .",
    "the interesting possibility is that some other model for structure formation with a very different value of @xmath19 may give an even better fit to the improved measurements .",
