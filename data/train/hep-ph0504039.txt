    "the possible existence of exotic hadrons was suggested in connection with the @xmath5 scattering data @xcite ( before the advent of qcd ) . in qcd",
    "the multiquark states were considered as natural extension of the ordinary hadrons . a state with mass about 1.5 gev and a strong decay width smaller than 15 mev , now called @xmath0 pentaquark ,",
    "was predicted in ref .",
    "this work motivated and oriented experimental searches recently leading to the observation of a narrow resonance at about the predicted mass @xcite .",
    "so far this observation has been confirmed or infirmed by other experimental groups using various projectiles and targets ( for the details see the review @xcite ) .",
    "the narrow exotic ( b=1 , s=1 ) baryon resonance @xmath6 was called pentaquark since the simplest quark content of @xmath0 is ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the quantum numbers of the pentaquarks are very important for the determination of its quark structure and in particular its multiplet assignment @xcite .    at present",
    "the existence of a narrow pentaquarks is not fully confirmed : several laboratories have reported the evidence of such states , while others have negative results .",
    "the question of whether pentaquarks exist may be solved by a second generation of high statistics experiments ( for example , at jlab @xcite ) .",
    "the parity of the @xmath0 pentaquark , @xmath8 , being a very important characteristics of this exotic state , is especially challenging for a model independent determination .",
    "the study of polarization phenomena for different processes of @xmath0 production seems unavoidable .",
    "unfortunately , in many cases , the necessary set of observables includes the @xmath0 polarization which measurement , through the decay @xmath9 , is not an easy task .    up to now",
    ", the most perspective method for the determination of @xmath8 , in model independent way , has been suggested for associative hyperon production in nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "it was shown , that in the threshold region , ( with s - wave production of the final hyperons ) double spin polarization observables , such as the spin correlation coefficients @xmath14 or @xmath15 ( in the collision of polarized nucleons ) , and the spin transfer coefficient @xmath16 ( from one initial nucleon , beam or target , to the produced hyperon @xmath17 ) is sensitive to @xmath8 .",
    "we discuss in the present work another possible , simple reaction , the two body associative hyperon production , with baryon number equal 2 , similar to @xmath18 , but with a deuteron in the initial state : @xmath19 in the threshold region [ @xmath20= 1.04 gev , with @xmath21=1.54 gev ] or in collinear kinematics , with the aim of finding some polarization observables which are sensitive to @xmath8 .",
    "note that a similar reaction , @xmath22 , has been suggested many years ago @xcite for the model independent determination of the charged pion parity .",
    "the study of the reaction ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) in collinear kinematics looks more preferable in comparison with the threshold region , due to the larger cross section in forward direction , and to the fact that the formalism applies to any pion energy .",
    "the simplest mechanism for the reaction ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "it is similar to the impulse approximation , where the new deuteron vertex , @xmath24 , generates a deuteron component made from eight quarks : @xmath25 .",
    "this component is not new .",
    "for example , the presence of an intrinsic @xmath26 component in the nucleon has been advocated to explain the strong violation of the ozi rule , which has been observed in different processes of @xmath27 production , in particular in @xmath28 annihilation at rest ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "it is possible to rearrange the @xmath29 system , composed by @xmath30 , as superposition of @xmath0 and @xmath31 hyperons and to derive a connection between the deuteron structure at short distances and the @xmath0 physics .",
    "however , our interest here is focused on the dependence of the polarization effects in the reaction ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) on the parity of the @xmath32 hyperon , @xmath8 .",
    "to solve this problem we use only general symmetry properties of the strong interaction , such as the p - invariance and the isotropy of space .    in the general case ,",
    "the matrix element for @xmath33 contains six independent spin structures , assuming spin 1/2 for @xmath0 , which have different parametrizations according to @xmath8 . from the isotopic invariance we have @xmath34 .",
    "the capture process , @xmath22 @xcite , proved the pseudoscalar nature of the pion . in this case",
    "no polarization observable is necessary , as the identity of the produced neutrons generates only one spin structure .",
    "unfortunately , one can not use such procedure for @xmath33 , due to different final hyperons .    to avoid the complexity of the calculation of the polarization phenomena in reaction ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) , we restrict our analysis to two different kinematical regimes : threshold production and collinear regime .",
    "although the dynamics is different in these two cases , the analysis of polarization effects is similar , due to the axial symmetry of the two regimes : only one physical direction is defined : the three - momentum of the colliding particles .",
    "this essentially simplifies the calculations .",
    "let us start from considerations which hold in threshold regime .",
    "the production of the final hyperons in @xmath35-state is characterized by two different partial transitions : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the orbital angular momentum of the initial pion ( in the reaction cms ) , @xmath39 is the total spin of the the @xmath40-system , @xmath41 is the total angular momentum and parity of colliding ( and final ) particles .",
    "the spin structure of the corresponding matrix element can be written as : @xmath42\\sigma_y\\tilde\\chi_1^{\\dagger},\\label{eq : m1}\\\\ { \\cal m}^{(-)}=\\chi_2^{\\dagger } \\left [ f_1^{(-)}\\vec\\sigma\\cdot\\vec u+ f_2^{(-)}\\vec \\sigma\\cdot\\hat{\\vec q}\\hat{\\vec q}\\cdot\\vec u\\right ] \\sigma_y\\tilde\\chi_1^{\\dagger},\\label{eq : m2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the two component spinors of the @xmath0 and @xmath12 hyperon , @xmath45 is the unit vector along the pion three momentum , @xmath46 is the deuteron polarization three - vector , @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the partial amplitudes of the transitions ( [ eq : tr1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tr2 ] ) , which are , in general case , complex functions of the excitation energy @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the masses of @xmath51 and @xmath12 , @xmath52 is the invariant total energy of the colliding particles .",
    "note that the spin structure of the matrix elements @xmath53 in collinear regime ( i.e. , for any value of @xmath52 and production angle equal @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) is described by the same formulas , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) , but the amplitudes @xmath56 describe two different allowed helicity transitions , which work in collinear kinematics .",
    "therefore , so different kinematical conditions are described by different amplitudes , but , due to the axial symmetry inherent to the considered problem , the same analysis of polarization phenomena can be applied .",
    "the axial symmetry and the p - invariance of the strong interaction allow only single spin polarization observables in @xmath57 , namely , the analyzing power induced by the quadrupole polarization of the deuteron target : @xmath58 , \\label{eq : eqa}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the analyzing power , and @xmath60 is the tensor which describes the deuteron quadrupole polarization . the spin  density matrix of the deuteron is described by ( in the reaction cms ) : @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the vector polarization and energy ( mass ) of the deuteron target in the reaction cms .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath12-hyperon polarization @xmath65 , on the polarization characteristics of the deuteron target , can be written in the following general form : @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , are real functions which can be expressed in terms of bilinear combinations of the reaction amplitudes .",
    "these functions are related to the following coefficients of the polarization transfer from the initial deuteron to the produced @xmath12-hyperon : @xmath70 where the @xmath71-axis is chosen along the @xmath45 direction , but the @xmath72 and @xmath73 directions can not be uniquely fixed , due to the axial symmetry .",
    "summarizing , it is possible to measure four t - even observables : @xmath74  @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 and one t - odd observable , the coefficient @xmath78 .    therefore , we can state that there must be a definite linear relations between t - even observables , which is model independent and works in collinear and threshold regime , as well .    to find this relation ,",
    "let us express the coefficients @xmath77 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath78 as quadratic combinations of the corresponding amplitudes ( for both cases of the @xmath0 parity ) :    @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a kinematical factor .    from these formulas",
    ", one can find a linear relation between t - even polarization observables : @xmath89 this relation is the same for the two possible values of the @xmath0 parity .",
    "therefore , it can not be used for the determination of this parity .",
    "being model independent , this relation can be useful to determine the extension of the threshold region , i.e. , of the @xmath35-wave dominance .",
    "the measurement of the analyzing power @xmath59 and cross section @xmath90 allows to realize the first step of the complete experiment for @xmath91 , i.e. , the determination of the moduli of the two complex amplitudes : @xmath92 @xmath93 evidently , the t - odd observable @xmath78 , being proportional to @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is the relative phase of the complex amplitudes @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) , is the most sensitive to this phase .",
    "this is the last step of the complete experiment .",
    "it is possible also to find definite quadratic relations between t - odd and t - even observables : @xmath98 it is another result , which shows also that the specific quadratic combination of different observables of t - odd and t - even nature does not depend on @xmath8 . in order to test these relations",
    ", it necessary to have a deuteron target , vector and tensor polarized , and to measure the @xmath12-hyperon polarization .",
    "these linear and quadratic relations apply equally well for threshold and for collinear kinematics of the considered process .",
    "but the situation is different for the @xmath0 polarization .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath0 pentaquark polarization @xmath99 , on the polarization characteristics of the deuteron target , can be written in the following general form ( similar to eq .",
    "( 8) ) : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath69 , are real functions which can be expressed in terms of bilinear combinations of the reaction amplitudes . using eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) for the matrix elements we can obtain the following expressions for @xmath102 in terms of quadratic combinations of the corresponding amplitudes ( for both cases of the @xmath0 parity )    @xmath79 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 from these formulas one can see that only the transversal components of the @xmath0 polarization vector are sensitive to the pentaquark parity : @xmath106 in terms of the coefficients of polarization transfer @xmath107 [ @xmath108 from vector ",
    "polarized deuteron target to the @xmath109 ( @xmath12 ) hyperons , these relations can be written as follows : @xmath110 evidently , it is a very difficult experiment .",
    "we performed a model independent analysis of the spin structure of the matrix element for associative hyperon production in @xmath111 collisions , @xmath91 , in collinear or threshold regime .",
    "we calculated different polarization observables and showed that they are related by very specific linear and quadratic equations . unfortunately , these model independent relations are insensitive to the parity of the @xmath51-pentaquark .",
    "therefore , difficult measurements of the @xmath0 polarization are necessary in order to determine the parity of the @xmath0 .    what is the physical reason of such insensitivity of the @xmath112 process to @xmath8 ? what is the main difference between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which look very similar processes ?",
    "the problem is that the initial two - nucleon system in @xmath113 is more flexible , as it can be in triplet and singlet state , as well , whereas in @xmath112 the initial two - nucleon system , being a deuteron , is always in triplet state .",
    "however , if the parity of @xmath0 will be determined , the study of the process @xmath91 will be useful for the study of other questions , related to the @xmath0 physics , as , for example , the exotic baryon content of the deuteron at small distances .",
