    "wootters , zurek and dieks @xcite first questioned whether it is possible to exactly clone a quantum state , i.e. produce copies of a quantum system each having the same state as the original .",
    "they came up with the famous _ no cloning theorem _ which states that it is impossible to perfectly clone an arbitrary quantum state @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are qubit states .",
    "subsequently , buek and hillery described a copying process which is input - state independent using a universal quantum copying machine @xcite .",
    "gisin @xcite showed that the buek - hillery machine gives maximum fidelity for any arbitrary state @xmath6 .",
    "later various quantum cloning machine protocols were introduced @xcite .",
    "experimentally , quantum cloning machines have been implemented in quantum optics @xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance systems @xcite .    in order to find the maximum fidelity ( defined below in section 2 ) obtainable in quantum cloning",
    "we must remember that the extremisation has to be with respect to the free parameters available .",
    "maximum fidelity corresponds to minimum hilbert schmidt norm and _ vice versa_. in the buek - hillery scenario , the extremisation is input state independent , i.e. the hilbert schmidt norm is independent of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the other parameters were the overlaps of the various machine states .",
    "unitarity of the cloning transformation gave relations between the overlaps of the machine states .",
    "using those relations the cauchy - schwarz inequality ( csi)bounds for the overlaps of machine states were determined . imposing input state independence , buek and hillery",
    "then obtained the values of these overlaps and showed that they satisfy the csi bounds .",
    "subsequently they used these results to obtain the best possible cloning .",
    "the motive of this work is to investigate whether the quantum cloning which was input state independent in the buek - hillery protocol can be improved .",
    "we then compare our results with the standard works @xcite .",
    "we also consider a new state dependent quantum cloning protocol with four machine states where all non - exact copies of input states are taken into account in the output .",
    "we use the hessian method and calculate fidelity , hilbert - schmidt norm and von - neumann entropy of this new protocol .",
    "our extremisation procedure is with respect to the overlaps of machine states .",
    "accordingly , the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "below in the next section , we reconsider the buek and hillery quantum cloning protocol and show that one can obtain a better value of the hilbert - schmidt norm and fidelity ( defined below in section 2 ) than hitherto known . in section 3 we reconsider bru , cinchetti _ et al . _ phase covariant quantum cloning protocol with input pure state as @xmath9 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are complex . in section 4 we consider a state dependent quantum cloning protocol and obtain the relevant density operators and the relevant csi bounds for the overlaps of the machine states . in section 5",
    "we consider various possible choices for the overlaps of machine states . for certain choices of overlaps",
    "we get the best possible cloning in our protocol .",
    "the conclusions are in section 6 .",
    "buek and hillery proposed the univeral quantum copying machine ( uqcm ) protocol as @xcite @xmath10| y_0\\rangle_{x}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath11 stands for states of original system and @xmath12 for states of copied system .",
    "@xmath13 is input state of the copying machine , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are the final output states of the copying machine .",
    "the relevant output density operator of @xmath17 mode is @xcite : @xmath18\\nonumber\\\\ & + | 0\\rangle_a\\ , _",
    "a\\langle 1|\\alpha\\beta \\left [ _ x\\langle q_1|y_0\\rangle_x+\\ , _",
    "x\\langle y_1|q_0\\rangle_x \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + | 1\\rangle_a\\ , _",
    "a\\langle 0|\\alpha\\beta \\left[\\ , _",
    "x\\langle q_0|y_1\\rangle_x+\\ , _",
    "x\\langle y_0|q_1\\rangle_x \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + | 1\\rangle_a\\ , _",
    "a\\langle 1| \\left [ \\beta^2 + \\alpha^2\\ , _",
    "x\\langle y_0|y_0\\rangle_x -\\beta^2\\ , _",
    "x\\langle y_1|y_1\\rangle_x \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the input density operator of the mode @xmath17 is @xmath19 here the density operator of the output state of @xmath17 mode is different from the input state density operator of @xmath17 mode .",
    "this means during cloning ( _ unitary transformation _ ) original input state is disturbed . to quantify the amount of disturbance the hilbert - schmidt norm of @xmath17 mode",
    "is defined as @xcite : @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "another measure of distinguishability between two quantum states is fidelity @xcite : @xmath21 .",
    "large @xmath22 means the states are less distinguishable .",
    "for buek - hillery uqcm protocol , hilbert schmidt norm is @xcite @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 in buek - hillery paper are replaced by @xmath26 and @xmath27 in our calculation . @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the csi bounds for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "both terms in the expression of @xmath32 are positive definite .",
    "@xmath32 is minimum with respect to the inner products of machine states @xmath26 and @xmath27 when @xmath33 and @xmath34 and the value of this minimum is @xmath35 .",
    "but @xmath26 can never be @xmath35 because then both @xmath36 , @xmath37 will be zero . also if @xmath33 then @xmath38 and things become meaningless .",
    "further , @xmath34 violates csi which give the bounds as @xmath31 .",
    "so @xmath39 .    if we want @xmath32 to be input state independent , then @xmath40 as in @xcite .",
    "from there we get @xmath41",
    ". then equation ( [ cl30 ] ) reduces to @xmath42 .",
    "so @xmath32 is minimum when @xmath27 is maximum . here",
    "also @xmath43 if @xmath34 . but",
    "this value of @xmath27 is ruled out for reasons already given in the previous paragraph",
    ".    however , the buek - hillery protocol can give better values for fidelity and hilbert - schmidt norm as we now show .",
    "if we choose the value of one of the overlaps within the csi bound then the value of the other overlap is automatically fixed .",
    "let us choose the maximum value of the overlap @xmath27 allowed by csi which is @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath32 would be minimum .",
    "for this value of @xmath27 , @xmath45 and this value is within the csi bound . for this set of values of the overlaps",
    "@xmath32 becomes minimum which is @xmath46 .",
    "this is the minimum possible value of the distance @xmath32 which is input state independent and the overlaps of machine states satisfy csi .",
    "buek and hillery got the minimum values of @xmath32 as @xmath47 @xcite . here",
    "our estimated minimum value of @xmath32 is lower than that of found by buek and hillery .",
    "buek and hillery @xcite also evaluated @xmath50 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\ & & = 1 + 8\\alpha ^4\\beta ^4 -4\\alpha ^2 \\beta ^2(1 + 2a)+(1 - 2a)^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & - 2(1 - 2a)(1-\\alpha^ 2\\beta ^2 ) + 4 a^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and found it s minimum value to be equal to @xmath51 .",
    "evaluating the same for @xmath45 , ( after averaging over @xmath7 ) we get the minimum value of @xmath52 as@xmath53 .",
    "so we have a better estimate of @xmath52 also .",
    "summarising          for these values of inner products of machine states the cloning machine protocol ( [ 100 ] ) and ( [ 101 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath57|\\downarrow \\rangle_{x}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath58 can be expressed as a linear superposition of two basis states @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in our calculation we get the values of various inner products of machine states as @xmath61 @xmath55 @xmath62      99 w. k. wootters and w. h. zurek , nature * 299 * , 802 ( 1982 ) ; d. dieks , phys .",
