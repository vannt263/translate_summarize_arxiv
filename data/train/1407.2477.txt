    "bilayer graphene is attracting considerable attention .",
    "recent experimental studies ( including scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite , raman  @xcite , and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite ) revealed that , in many cases , the structure of bilayer samples is far from the ideal ab stacking and is characterized by a non - zero twist angle @xmath1 between graphene layers .",
    "the physics of twisted bilayer graphene ( tblg ) is very rich .",
    "the system demonstrates dirac spectrum with a @xmath1-dependent fermi velocity  @xcite , low - energy van hove singularities  @xcite , and other interesting features  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the low - energy electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene is based on the notion that for certain , so - called ` commensurate ' , values of @xmath1 , the tblg lattice may be thought of as a periodic repetition of supercells , containing large number of carbon atoms . for such angles , numerical studies based on density functional theory and tight - binding calculations  @xcite",
    "were performed .",
    "since the number of atoms in an elementary unit cell of the tblg superlattice may be quite substantial , especially at small twist angles , the _ ab initio _ calculations incur a significant computational cost .",
    "therefore , the use of such approaches is quite limited . to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "several semi - analytical theories have been developed for describing the low - energy electronic properties of the tblg  @xcite .",
    "these low - energy theories operate mainly with the electronic states near the dirac cones , which the tblg inherits from its two constituent layers . in the tblg ,",
    "the dirac cones with equal chirality are located close to each other in momentum space .",
    "the interlayer hopping couples these cones and suppresses the fermi velocity  @xcite , which becomes a function of @xmath1 .",
    "if subtler effects are of interest  @xcite , a term hybridizing these dirac cones must be added to the effective long - wave hamiltonian of the tblg .",
    "the corresponding electronic spectrum obtained is gapped or gapless depending on the type of commensurate structure .",
    "when the twist angle is small ( @xmath6 ) , the electronic structure changes qualitatively .",
    "the picture with dirac cones becomes irrelevant .",
    "instead , the system acquires a finite density of states at the fermi level  @xcite .    yet , despite definite progress , several important theoretical issues remain unaddressed .",
    "for example , the regime of low - twist angles received very limited attention .",
    "the regime of larger angles was studied in more details . however , the current understanding of this limit is not without discrepancies .",
    "the types of spectra predicted in ref .   do not coincide with those obtained by tight - binding calculations  @xcite .",
    "the value of the single - electron gap was evaluated for several commensurate twist angles , see refs .  ; nonetheless , the generic dependence of the gap on @xmath1 was not discussed .",
    "here we report the results of tight - binding calculations of the band structure of tblg in a wide range of twist angles . to tackle the issue of the large supercell size we use the lanczos algorithm , which allows us to calculate the low - energy single - electron spectrum of tblg .",
    "we find that the tblg single - electron properties are qualitatively different for @xmath1 larger and smaller than the critical angle @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 , the low - energy spectrum can be considered roughly as consisting of two doubly degenerate dirac cones located near two dirac points in the brillouin zone of the superlattice .",
    "the fermi velocity of dirac electrons is continuous function of the twist angle @xmath1 , and it decreases when @xmath1 decreases .",
    "this result is in agreement both with the low - energy theories  @xcite and the tight - binding calculations , reported elsewhere  @xcite .    under more scrutiny",
    "the spectrum reveals its fine structure : the double - degeneracy of the single - electron bands is weakly lifted , and for the momenta close to the dirac points the dispersion deviates from massless dirac spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the tblg can be gapped or gapless depending on the type of superstructure , but for any superstructure the band splitting is non - zero .",
    "the maximum value of the band gap is estimated to be @xmath3mev .",
    "it corresponds to the twist angle @xmath9 .",
    "however , in contrast to the fermi velocity , the band splitting is a discontinuous function of the twist angle . it can change exponentially , even for small variations of @xmath1",
    "such a feature makes it difficult to predict the gap value for real samples , whose twist angles are always known with some non - zero error .",
    "it is demonstrated that this sensitivity of the gap to small variations of the angle is absent for a sample of finite size .",
    "the relevance of this ` smoothing ' for experiment is discussed .    at the critical angle @xmath10 , the fermi velocity vanishes , and for @xmath11",
    "the cone - like structure of the low - energy bands becomes irrelevant .",
    "instead , the system has a finite density of states and a fermi surface .",
    "the fermi surface changes smoothly as a function of @xmath1 .",

    "it is related to the twist angle according to the following formula @xmath67 the moir pattern and the superstructure are two complementary concepts used to describe tblg .",
    "the moir pattern depends smoothly on the twist angle , see , e.g. , eq .  ( [ moirep ] ) .",
    "the pattern can be easily detected experimentally .",
    "however , working with the moir theoretically may be challenging due to the fact that the pattern is strictly periodic only for a very limited discrete set of angles . for a generic value of @xmath1 , different moir cells in a pattern may look alike , but they are not exactly identical .",
    "the superstructure , which is a periodic lattice of supercells , does not suffer from this shortcoming .",
    "unfortunately , it has its own deficiencies .",
    "namely , the superstructure is only defined for commensurate angles @xmath1 .",

    "the supercells of these structures contain @xmath70 ( if @xmath58 ) or @xmath71 ( if @xmath37 ) moir cells , and the arrangements of atoms inside these moir cells are slightly different from each other .",
    "this means , in particular , that the structures with @xmath72 can be considered as almost periodic repetitions of structures with @xmath52 , as it was shown in ref .  .",
    "the basis vectors of the reciprocal superlattice can be written as @xmath73 if @xmath58 , or @xmath74 if @xmath37 , where @xmath75 are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the single - layer graphene .",

    "this side is equal to @xmath77 , where @xmath78 are the dirac points of the bottom and top layers , respectively .",
    "as known from basic graphene tight - binding physics , in addition to the dirac cone at the @xmath57 point , the bottom layer of the tblg has another cone of opposite chirality at @xmath79 .",
    "likewise , the top layer has its second cone at @xmath80 .",
    "it is important to determine where these two cones are located in the brillouin zone of the superstructure . to find this out we express their co - ordinates in terms of reciprocal superlattice vectors .",
    "for @xmath58 we have @xmath81 while for @xmath37 we obtain @xmath82 it follows from these formulas that , if @xmath58 , point @xmath54 is equivalent to @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is equivalent to @xmath55 : for such a value of @xmath34 the difference @xmath83 is a reciprocal vector of the superlattice .",
    "when @xmath37 , the equivalent dirac points are : @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus , for any commensurate angle we have two doubly - degenerate non - equivalent dirac points of the tblg .",
