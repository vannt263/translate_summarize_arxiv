    "binary systems can be roughly divided into close ( semi - major axes @xmath18 au ) and wide ( semi - major axes @xmath19 au , @xcite ) pairs .",
    "close binary systems have long been recognized as useful tools for studies of stellar properties .",
    "for example , the stellar parameters such as the masses and radii of individual stars are readily determined to high confidence using eclipsing binaries @xcite .",
    "wide binary systems have proven to be a tool for studies of star formation processes , as well as an exceptionally useful tracer of local potential and tidal fields through which they traverse .",
    "specifically , they were used to place the constraints on the nature of halo dark matter @xcite and to explore the dynamical history of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "a further comprehensive list of current applications of wide binaries can be found in @xcite .",
    "close binaries , owing to their relatively short orbital periods and equally short timescales of brightness or spectrum fluctuations , are fairly easy to detect . unambiguous identification of wide binary systems , on the other hand , requires accurate astrometry on much longer timescales , as these systems have orbital periods @xmath20 years .",
    "however , instead of requiring unambiguous identification , large samples of _ candidate _ wide binaries can be selected by simply assuming that pairs of stars with small angular separation are also gravitationally bound @xcite , or by searching for common proper motion pairs @xcite .",
    "the angular separation method is simple to apply , but it also introduces a relatively large number of false candidates due to chance association of nearby pairs .",
    "the contamination by random associations can be reduced by imposing constraints , such as the common proper motion , or by requiring that the stars are at similar distances .",
    "the distances can be inferred through a variety of means , one of which is the use of an appropriate photometric parallax relation .",
    "the photometric parallax relation provides the absolute magnitude of a star given that star s color and metallicity .",
    "there are a number of proposed photometric parallax relations for main sequence stars in the literature that differ in the methodology used to derive them , photometric systems , and the absolute magnitude and metallicity range in which they are applicable .",
    "not all of them are mutually consistent , and most exhibit significant intrinsic scatter of order a half a magnitude or more ( see figure  2 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter j08 ) ) .    instead of using an existing relation to select wide binaries ,",
    "we propose a novel method that _ simultaneously _ derives the photometric parallax relation _ and _ selects a sample of wide binary candidates .",
    "the method relies on the fact that components of a physical binary have equal distance moduli ( @xmath21 ) and therefore @xmath22 . assuming that both stars are on the main sequence , and the _ shape _ of the adopted photometric parallax relation is correct , the difference in absolute magnitudes @xmath23 calculated from the parallax relation must equal the measured difference of apparent magnitudes , @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 equality for binaries must be valid irrespective of color , and therefore represents a test of the validity of the adopted photometric parallax relation or , alternatively , a way to estimate the parallax relation .    in practice",
    ", the distribution of @xmath26 will not be a delta - function both due to instrumental ( finite photometric precision ) and physical effects ( true vs.  apparent pairs ) .",
    "however , for _ true _ wide binaries , the distribution of @xmath26 is expected to be narrow , strongly peaked at zero , and the individual @xmath26 values are expected to be uncorrelated with color .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of @xmath26 values for randomly associated stellar pairs ( hereafter random pairs ) should be much broader even when the correct photometric parallax relation is adopted , reflecting the different distances of components of projected binary pairs .",
    "this dichotomy can be used to assign a probability to each candidate , of whether it is a true physical binary or a result of chance projection on the sky .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ data ] , we give an overview of the sdss imaging data , and describe the selection , completeness and population composition of two initial , independent samples of candidate binaries . in section  [ method ] we describe the photometric parallax estimation method , compare the best - fit photometric parallax relations to the j08 relation , and analyze the scatter in predicted absolute magnitudes .",
    "the properties of wide binaries , such as the color and spatial distributions , are analyzed in section  [ properties ] .",
    "finally , the results and their implications for future surveys are discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "thanks to the quality of its photometry and astrometry , as well as the large sky coverage , the sdss stands out among available optical sky surveys .",
    "the sdss provides homogeneous and deep ( @xmath27 ) photometry in five bandpasses ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xcite ) accurate to 0.02 mag ( rms scatter ) for unresolved sources not limited by photon statistics @xcite , and with a zeropoint uncertainty of 0.02 mag @xcite . the survey sky coverage of 10,000 deg@xmath33 in the northern galactic cap and 300 deg@xmath33 in the southern galactic cap results in photometric measurements for well over 100 million stars and a similar number of galaxies @xcite",
    "the recent data release 6 @xcite lists photometric data for 287 million unique objects observed in 9583 deg@xmath33 of sky , and can be accessed through the catalog archive server[multiblock footnote omitted ] ( cas ) casjobs[multiblock footnote omitted ] interface .",
    "astrometric positions are accurate to better than @xmath34 per coordinate ( rms ) for sources with @xmath35 @xcite , and the morphological information from the images allows reliable star - galaxy separation to @xmath36 @xcite",
    ".    the five - band sdss photometry can be used for very detailed source classification , e.g. , separation of quasars and stars @xcite , spectral classification of stars to within one to two spectral subtypes @xcite , identification of horizontal - branch and rr lyrae stars @xcite , and low - metallicity g and k giants @xcite .",
    "proper motion data exist for sdss sources matched to the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "we take proper motion measurements from the @xcite catalog based on astrometric measurements from the sdss and palomar observatory sky surveys ( poss - i ; @xcite , poss - ii ; @xcite ) . despite the sizable random and systematic astrometric errors in the schmidt surveys , the combination of a long baseline ( 50 years for the poss - i survey ) and a recalibration of the photographic data using positions of sdss galaxies , results in median random errors for proper motions of only 3 mas yr@xmath37 for @xmath38 ( per coordinate ) , with substantially smaller systematic errors @xcite . following a recommendation by munn et al . , when using their catalog we select sdss stars with only one usno - b match within @xmath39 , and require proper motion rms fit residuals to be less than 350 mas in both coordinates .",
    "we note that the proper motion measurements publicly available as a part of sdss data release 6 are known to have significant systematic errors ( munn et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "here we use a revised set of proper motion measurements which will become publicly available as a part of sdss data release 7 .      for objects in the sdss catalog ,",
    "the photometric pipeline @xcite sets a number of flags that indicate the status of each object , warn of possible problems with the image itself , and warn of possible problems in the measurement of various quantities associated with the object .",
    "these flags can be used to remove duplicate detections ( in software ) of the same object , and to select samples of unresolved sources with good photometry .    according to the sdss catalog archive server `` algorithms ''",
    "webpage[multiblock footnote omitted ] , duplicate detections of the same objects can be removed by considering only those which have the `` status '' flag set to primary .",
    "we consider only primary objects , and select those with good photometry by requiring that the binned1 flag is set to 1 , and psf_flux_interp , deblend_nopeak , interp_center , bad_counts_error , notchecked , noprofile , peakcenter , and edge image processing flags are set to 0 in the @xmath40 bands .",
    "the moving unresolved sources , such as asteroids , are avoided by selecting sources with the deblended_as_moving flag set to 0 .",
    "good photometric accuracy ( mean psf magnitude errors @xmath41 mag , see figure  1 in @xcite ) is obtained by selecting sources with @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the @xmath30 band psf magnitude uncorrected for ism extinction .",
    "the psf magnitudes corrected for ism extinction ( using maps by @xcite ) , and used throughout this work , are noted as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .    to create the initial sample of resolved stellar pairs , we query ] the cas `` neighbors '' table ( lists all sdss pairs within @xmath44 ) for pairs of sources that pass the above criteria , and that have @xmath45>0\\label{teff},\\ ] ] where the subscript 1 is hereafter assigned to the brighter component . with this condition",
    "we require that the component with bluer @xmath46 color is brighter in the @xmath30 band .",
    "about @xmath47 of random pairs are rejected with this condition .",
    "we estimate that about @xmath48 of true binary systems might be excluded by this cut ( due to uncertainties in the @xmath46 color caused by photometric errors ) , but their exclusion does not significantly influence our results .",
    "we select @xmath49 million pairs for the initial sample of resolved stellar pairs , and plot the observed distribution of angular separation @xmath50 , @xmath51 , in figure  [ ang_sep ] ( _ top _ ) . for a uniform ( random ) distribution of stars , the number of neighboring stars within an annulus @xmath52 increases linearly with @xmath50 , and therefore , the number of random pairs also increases with @xmath50 . to find the number of random pairs as a function of @xmath50",
    ", we fit @xmath53 to the @xmath54 histogram ( in the @xmath55 region ) , and find @xmath56 arcsec@xmath37 . for large separation angles ( @xmath55 ) the two distributions closely",
    "match , indicating that the majority of observed pairs are simply random associations , and are not physically related . at separation angles smaller than @xmath57 the frequency of observed pairs shows an excess , suggesting the presence of true , gravitationally bound systems .",
    "however , even at small separation angles , the selected pairs include a non - negligible fraction of random pairs and require further refinement , or careful statistical accounting for random contamination .    throughout this work we use samples of random pairs ( random samples , hereafter ) to account for random contamination in candidate binaries .",
    "we define the random sample as a sample of pairs with @xmath58 taken from the initial pool of stellar pairs .",
    "since pairs in the random sample pass the same data quality selection as candidate binaries , and since virtually all of them are chance associations ( @xmath59 ; see section  [ samples ] and figure  [ ang_sep ] ) , the random sample is a fair representation of the population of randomly associated stars in candidate binary samples .",
    "the excess of pairs with @xmath60 in figure  [ ang_sep ] ( _ top _ ) likely indicates a presence of true binaries , and the angular separation provides a simple , _ geometric _ criterion to select candidate binary systems .",
    "this excess , shown as the ratio @xmath61 in figure  [ ang_sep ] ( _ bottom _ ) , increases for @xmath60 , reaches a relatively flat peak of @xmath62 for @xmath63 , and sharply decreases for @xmath64 due to finite seeing and inability to resolve close pairs of sources .",
    "this excess is related to the fraction of true binaries , @xmath65 , as @xmath66 using figure  [ ang_sep ] ( _ bottom _ ) , we choose @xmath63 for our geometric selection criterion , since the fraction of true binaries is expected to reach a maximum of @xmath67 in this range .",
    "the interpretation of the excess of close stellar pairs as gravitationally bound binary pairs implies that the components are at similar distances . if this is true , and if it is possible to constrain the distance via a photometric parallax relation , than their distribution in the color - magnitude diagram should be different than for a sample of randomly associated stars .",
    "to test this hypothesis , we select 51,753 candidate binaries with @xmath63 .",
    "we compare their distribution in the @xmath68 vs.  @xmath69 diagram to the distribution of pairs from the random sample , as shown in figure  [ counts ] .",
    "the number of pairs in this random sample is restricted to 51,753 . were the selection a random process",
    ", the selected candidates would have the same distribution in this diagram as the random sample , and the average candidate - to - random ratio would be @xmath70 .",
    "however , in the region where @xmath71 and @xmath72 the two distributions are different ( average candidate - to - random ratio of @xmath73 ) , implying that @xmath74 of candidates are found at similar distances . in principle",
    ", a selection cut using equations  [ color_cut1 ] and  [ color_cut2 ] could be made to increase the fraction of true binaries in the candidate sample .",
    "we do not make such a cut a priori , but instead develop a method ( described in section  [ method ] ) that robustly `` ignores '' random pairs while estimating the photometric parallax relation .",
    "after a best - fit photometric parallax relation is obtained , the contamination can be minimized by selecting only pairs where both components are at similar distances , as described in section  [ samples ] .",
    "the @xmath30 vs.  @xmath46 distributions of brighter and fainter components of candidate binaries are shown in figure  [ r_vs_gi ] .",
    "we find that the brighter components in the candidate sample are mostly disk g to m dwarfs , while the fainter components are mostly m dwarfs .",
    "as seen from figure  [ ang_sep ] ( _ top _ ) , candidate binaries with @xmath75 can not be efficiently selected using angular distance only , as nearly all pairs in this range are most likely chance associations . in this regime ,",
    "a _ kinematic _",
    "selection based on common proper motion should be more efficient , as random pairs have a small probability ( @xmath76 determined using monte carlo simulations ) to be common proper motion pairs ( using selection criteria listed below ) .",
    "we therefore select a second sample of 14,148 candidate binaries by searching for common proper motion pairs with proper motion difference @xmath77 mas @xmath78 , and with absolute proper motion in the range 15 mas @xmath79 400 mas @xmath78 , where @xmath80 .",
    "these criteria require that the directions of two proper motion vectors agree at a @xmath81 level , and that the proper motion is detected at a @xmath82 level or higher .",
    "the common proper motion pairs with orbital motion @xmath83 over 50 years are not selected because their usno - b and sdss positions place them outside the @xmath39 search radius used by munn et al .",
    "the angular separation of common proper motion pairs is limited to @xmath84 .",
    "pairs of sources with @xmath85 are usually blended in the usno - b data and may not have reliable proper motion measurements ( see section  [ limitations ] ) , while the maximum angular separation between sources in the cas `` neighbors '' table defines the upper limit of @xmath86 . however , for purposes of section  [ limitations ] , we have created a sample of common proper motion pairs that extends to @xmath87 .",
    "we have done so by matching sdss sources ( that pass the quality flags from section  [ initial_select ] ) within a @xmath88 search radius into common proper motion pairs .",
    "since this matching is computationally expensive , we have done this only for one sample .",
    "the @xmath30 vs.  @xmath46 distributions of brighter and fainter components of kinematically - selected candidate binaries are similar to those shown in figure  [ r_vs_gi ] .      before proceeding with the determination of photometric parallax relations and discussion of the properties of wide binary systems",
    ", we summarize the completeness of geometric and kinematic samples , and estimate their expected fractions of disk and halo populations .",
    "the samples are selected from a highly - dimensional space of measured parameters and an understanding of the selection effects is a prerequisite for determining the limitations of various derived statistical properties .",
    "for example , the geometric sample is selected using five parameters : the @xmath46 color of the two components , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , their apparent magnitudes , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and their angular separation on the sky , @xmath50 .",
    "the latter three can be transformed with the aid of a photometric parallax relation into a difference of their apparent magnitudes , @xmath93 , distance @xmath94 , and the projected physical separation , @xmath8 .",
    "we seek to constrain the photometric parallax relation by minimizing the difference @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is a two - dimensional function of @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( section  [ method ] ) , and at the same time derive constraints on the two - dimensional color distribution of wide binaries , on their @xmath8 distribution , and on any variation of these distributions with position in the galaxy ( section  [ properties ] ) .",
    "not all of these constraints can be derived independently of each other , and most are subject to severe selection effects . by judiciously selecting data subsets and projections of this five - dimensional parameter space ,",
    "these effects can be understood and controled , as described below .",
    "to illustrate the most important selection effects , we employ the photometric parallax relation and its dependence on metallicity derived by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter i08a ) .",
    "the quantitative differences between their photometric parallax relation and the ones derived here have negligible impact on the conclusions derived in this section . for simplicity",
    ", we select a sample of @xmath972.8 million stars with @xmath98 observed towards the north galactic pole ( @xmath99 ) , and study their counts as a function of distance and the @xmath46 color . due to this choice of field position ,",
    "the distance to each star is approximately equal to its distance from the galactic plane ( for a detailed study of the dependence of stellar number density on position within the milky way , see j08 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : dmvscolor ] illustrates several important selection effects .",
    "first , for any @xmath46 color there is a minimum and maximum distance corresponding to the sdss saturation limit at @xmath100 and the adopted faint limit at @xmath101 ; the probed distance range extends from 100 pc to 25 kpc . within",
    "the distance limits appropriate for a given color , the sample is essentially complete ( @xmath9798% , @xcite ) .",
    "second , these limits are strongly dependent on color : the bluest stars saturate at a distance of about 1 kpc , while the reddest stars are too faint to be detected even at a few hundred pc .",
    "equivalently , due to the finite dynamic range of sdss apparent magnitudes , there is no distance range where the entire color range from the blue disk turn - off edge to the red edge of luminosity function is completely covered .",
    "at best , at distances of about 1 kpc the color completeness extends from the blue edge to the peak of luminosity function at @xmath102 .",
    "third , when pairing stars into candidate binary systems , their color distribution at a given distance ( the requirement that the differences of apparent and absolute magnitudes are similar places the two stars from a candidate pair into a narrow horizontal strip in the distance modulus ( dm ) vs.  @xmath46 diagram shown in figure  [ fig : dmvscolor ] ) will be clipped : the ratio of the number of candidate binaries and the number of all single stars in the sample decreases at distances significantly different from @xmath70 kpc because of a bias against blue - red pairs .",
    "the binary samples selected from the @xmath971 kpc distance range can be used to measure the two - dimensional color distribution of wide binaries , as well as to gauge the dependence of their @xmath8 distribution on color .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath8 distribution on distance from the galactic plane can also be studied over a substantial distance range , but _ only under the assumption that it is independent of color . _",
    "the imposed @xmath50 range ( @xmath103 to @xmath44 ) limits the range of probed physical separation to values proportional to distance , and ranging from 3,000 au to 30,000 au at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "we discuss and account for these effects in more detail in section  [ spatial ] .",
    "the counts of main - sequence stars shown in figure  [ fig : dmvscolor ] include both disk and halo populations . with the available data , there are three methods that might be used for separating stars ( including candidate binary systems ) into disk and halo populations ( juri et al . , in prep . ) :    1 .   a statistical method based on the stellar number density profiles ( j08 ) : beyond about 3 kpc from the plane , halo stars begin to dominate",
    ". however , as shown in figure  [ fig : dmvscolor ] , only stars bluer than @xmath104 are detected at such distances .",
    "the stellar number density profiles suggest that the fraction of halo stars is below @xmath9720% closer than 1.5 kpc from the galactic plane ( see figure  6 in i08a ) .",
    "2 .   classification based on metallicity into low - metallicity ( @xmath105<-1 $ ] ) halo stars and higher metallicity stars . as shown by i08a , this is a robust and accurate method even when using photometric metallicity estimator , but it works only for stars with @xmath106 due to the limitations of the photometric metallicity method , and the sdss spectroscopic metallicity is available only for a small fraction of stars in the candidate samples .",
    "kinematic selection based on proper motion measurements , and implemented via a reduced proper motion diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) . however , as discussed in detail in appendix b , this method is robust only closer than 2 - 3 kpc from the galactic plane due to a rotational velocity gradient of disk stars which diminishes kinematic differences between halo and disk stars further away from the plane .    given the limitations of these methods , it is not possible to reliably separate disk and halo populations throughout the explored parameter space , and in both geometric and kinematic samples . for geometric sample ,",
    "the third method is not applicable because sdss - poss proper motions are not reliable at small angular distances ( @xmath107 ; see section  [ limitations ] ) .",
    "the requirement @xmath106 required for the second method results in a subsample with too narrow a color range to constrain the photometric parallax relation .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis of this subsample based on results from i08a indicates that fewer than 10% of stars in geometric sample belong to halo population ( this fraction increases with the distance from the galactic plane ; see figure 6 in i08a ) , and thus we expect that halo contamination plays only a minor role in the geometric sample .",
    "the kinematic sample is expected to include a non - negligible fraction of halo stars due to the selection of stars with substantial proper motions .",
    "we use the reduced proper motion diagram to estimate the fraction of halo candidate binary stars in this sample .",
    "the reduced proper motion for an arbitrary photometric bandpass , here @xmath30 , is defined as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is proper motion in arcsec @xmath78 ( sometimes an additional offset of 5 mag is added ) . using a relationship between proper motion , distance and tangential velocity , @xmath110 and @xmath111 equation  [ eq : rpm ]",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath112 where @xmath94 is distance in parsec , @xmath113 is the absolute magnitude , and @xmath114 is the heliocentric tangential velocity ( the projection of the heliocentric velocity on the plane of the sky ) , and @xmath115 is a constant ( @xmath116 if @xmath114 is expressed in km @xmath117 ) .",
    "therefore , for a population of stars with the same @xmath114 , the reduced proper motion is a measure of their absolute magnitude . as shown using similar data as discussed here ,",
    "halo and disk stars form two well - defined and separated sequences in the reduced proper motion vs.  color diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "we discuss the impact of different metallicity and velocity distributions of halo and disk stars on their reduced proper motion distributions in more detail in appendix b.    figure  [ fig:1wd ] shows reduced proper motion diagrams for stars observed towards the north galactic pole , constructed for two ranges of observed proper motion : 15 - 50 mas @xmath78 and 50 - 400 mas @xmath78 .",
    "the choice of the proper motion range , together with unavoidable apparent magnitude limits , strongly affects the probed distance range : the larger is the proper motion , the closer is the distance range over which the selection fraction is non - negligible .",
    "we find that the two sequences closely follow the expectations based on the analysis of metallicity and velocity distributions from i08a .",
    "the halo sequence can be efficiently separated by selecting stars with reduced proper motion larger than a boundary generated using the photometric parallax relation from i08a , evaluated for the median halo metallicity ( @xmath105=-1.5 $ ] ) and with @xmath114=180 km @xmath117 ( see equation  [ eq : rpm2 ] ) .",
    "this separation method is conceptually identical to the @xmath118 separator discussed by @xcite .",
    "they also proposed to account for a shift of the reduced proper motion sequences with galactic latitude , an effect which we discuss in more detail in appendix b. for the reasons described there , to account for the variation of the reduced proper motion sequences away from the galactic pole , we simply offset the @xmath114 value from 180 km @xmath117 to 110 km @xmath117",
    "( i.e. , the separator moves upwards in figure  [ fig:1wd ] by 1 mag ) . while this selection removes some disk binaries ,",
    "it is designed to exclude most of halo binaries from the sample .    with the aid of reduced proper motion separator",
    ", we separate kinematic sample into candidate halo ( 1,336 pairs ) and disk binaries ( 10,112 pairs ) .",
    "this fraction of halo systems is consistent with the above estimate obtained for the geometric sample . to assess selection effects",
    ", we first investigate the sample of single stars .",
    "the top left panel in figure  [ fig:2wd ] shows the fraction of all the stars shown in figure  [ fig:1wd ] that have proper motion larger than 15 mas @xmath78 and @xmath119 ( the latter limit ensures the sdss - poss proper motion catalog completeness above @xmath9790% ) .",
    "the selection efficiency is a strong function of distance , and falls from its maximum of @xmath9795% for nearby stars to below 50% at a distance of about 1 kpc .",
    "the candidate disk stars are detected in significant numbers to @xmath973 kpc , and halo stars beyond @xmath971 kpc .",
    "the fraction of selected stars that are classified as halo stars is below 20% closer than @xmath971.5 kpc from the galactic plane , and becomes essentially 100% beyond 3 kpc .",
    "the kinematic difference between halo and disk stars is blurred at distances beyond 2 - 3 kpc ( see appendix b ) , and the majority of disk stars at such distances are misidentified as halo stars ( the metallicity distribution implies that disk stars do exist at distances as large as 7 kpc from the galactic plane , see figure  10 in i08a ) . to demonstrate this effect",
    ", we use subsamples of candidate disk and halo binaries identified using the reduced proper motion diagram that have @xmath120 . for these pairs",
    "it is possible to estimate photometric metallicity ( i08a ) and use it as an independent population classifier .",
    "figure  [ plot_ug ] shows that practically all candidate binaries with @xmath105>-1 $ ] further than @xmath972 kpc from the galactic plane are misclassified as halo stars when using reduced proper motion diagram .    in summary , geometric sample is heavily dominated by disk binaries , with halo contamination all but negligible closer than about 2 kpc from the plane .",
    "kinematic sample becomes severely incomplete ( @xmath12150% ) further than @xmath972 kpc from the plane , and has a higher fraction of halo binaries than geometric sample , at a given distance from the plane .",
    "however , this halo contamination can be efficiently removed using the reduced proper motion diagram .",
    "unfortunately , the number of selected halo binaries is insufficient in number ( 1,336 in kinematic and 5,556 in geometric sample ) , and spans too narrow a color range to robustly constrain the photometric parallax relation .",
    "therefore , both samples of candidate binaries are supposed to yield similar photometric parallax relations , because both are dominated by disk stars .",
    "in principle , both the normalization and the shape of the photometric parallax relation ( i.e. , the shape of the main sequence in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ) vary as a function of color and metallicity @xcite . since our data do not allow a reliable estimate of metallicity over the entire range of observed colors , we can only estimate the `` mean '' shape of the photometric parallax relation as a function of color , for all metallicities present in the sample .",
    "such a mean shape is approximately an average of individual @xmath105$]-dependent relations , weighted by the sample metallicity distribution .",
    "j08 derived such `` mean '' photometric parallax relations appropriate at the red end for the nearby , metal - rich stars , and at the blue end for distant , metal - poor stars . i08a",
    "discuss the offset of photometric parallax relation as a function of metallicity ( see their figure  20 ) , and derived the metallicity range implied by `` mean '' photometric parallax relations from j08 .",
    "the derived metallicity range is consistent with the spatial distribution of metallicity derived by i08a and the color - magnitude limits of the sdss survey .",
    "we adopt the j08 polynomial @xmath122 parametrization of the photometric parallax relation @xmath123 where @xmath124 are the parameters we wish to estimate . to improve their accuracy , juri et al .",
    "used a maximum likelihood technique to estimate the @xmath122 color from the observed @xmath125 and @xmath122 colors .",
    "because of the brighter flux limit employed here , we use the measured @xmath46 color to derive a best estimate of the @xmath122 color via a stellar locus relation ( j08 ) : @xmath126 ) + r - i\\label{interp}\\ ] ] the @xmath122 color estimate obtained with this method has several times smaller noise than the measured @xmath122 color .",
    "this is because the observed dynamic range for the @xmath46 color is much larger than of the @xmath122 color ( @xmath127 mag vs.  @xmath70 mag ) , while their measurement errors are similar .",
    "the goal of parameter estimation algorithm is to determine the photometric parallax relation , @xmath128 , that minimizes the width of the distribution of @xmath26 values for _ true _ binary systems , where @xmath129 .",
    "the @xmath130 minimization can not be used for this purpose because random pairs , if not removed from the sample , will strongly bias the best - fit @xmath113 .",
    "the available color , angular separation , and proper motion information are insufficient to separate the random pairs from the true binaries .",
    "therefore , we need to design a fitting algorithm that will be least affected as possible by random pairs .    we begin by studying the behavior of @xmath26 values in mock catalogs .",
    "the first step in creating a mock catalog is the selection of 51,753 ( random ) pairs from the random sample .",
    "note that the fraction of true binaries in the random sample is only @xmath131 ( see section  [ samples ] ) .",
    "true binaries are then `` created '' in the mock catalog by replacing the observed @xmath92 magnitudes for @xmath132 of pairs with @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( equation 2 coefficients from j08 ) .",
    "the @xmath136 is a gaussian random variate added to account for the intrinsic scatter around the photometric parallax relation .",
    "the result of this process is a mock sample of candidates where @xmath132 of pairs are `` true '' binaries , and the rest ( @xmath137 ) is the contamination made of random pairs .",
    "the distribution of @xmath26 values for `` true '' binaries is , by definition , a 0.1 mag wide gaussian centered on zero when @xmath134 .",
    "figure  [ delta_hist_mock ] ( _ top _ ) shows the distribution of @xmath26 values for the mock sample evaluated with the `` true '' [ @xmath138 photometric parallax relation .",
    "the observed @xmath26 distribution can be described as a sum of a gaussian and a non - gaussian component .",
    "the non - gaussian component is due to random pairs ( the contamination ) , while the gaussian component ( 0.1 mag wide and centered on zero ) is due to the true binaries .",
    "when an @xmath113 relation different from the `` true '' ( or best - fit ) @xmath113 is adopted , the gaussian component becomes wider and _ the peak height of the @xmath26 distribution decreases _ , as shown in figure  [ delta_hist_mock ] ( _ bottom _ ) . at the same time , the peak height of the @xmath26 distribution of the contamination changes much less since the distribution is much wider ( @xmath139 mag wide ) . therefore , _ minimizing _",
    "the width of the @xmath26 distribution of true binaries , is equivalent to _ maximizing _ the peak height of the entire @xmath26 distribution .",
    "we quantify this peak height as the number of candidate binaries in the most populous @xmath26 bin .      to robustly explore the parameter space that defines the photometric parallax relation , and to find the best - fit coefficients @xmath140",
    ", we implement our algorithm as a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) process . the mcmc description given here and our implementation of the algorithm",
    "are based on examples given by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the mcmc aproach is to take an _",
    "n_-step intelligent random walk around the parameter space while recording the point in parameter space for each step .",
    "each successive step is allowed to be some small distance in parameter space from the previous position .",
    "a step is always accepted if it improves the fit , and is sometimes accepted on a random basis even if the fit is worse , where the goodness of the fit is quantified by some parameter ( usually with @xmath130 ) .",
    "the random acceptance of a bad fit ensures that the mcmc does not become stuck in a local minimum , and allows the mcmc to fully explore the surrounding parameter space .",
    "we start a monte carlo markov chain by setting all coefficients from equation  [ photo_parallax ] to zero ( @xmath141 ) . using this initial set of coefficients",
    "we evaluate @xmath142 for all candidate binaries assuming @xmath143 , and bin @xmath26 values in 0.1 mag wide bins .",
    "the number of candidate binaries in the most populous bin , @xmath144 , is used to quantify the relative goodness of the fit .    given @xmath145 , a new candidate step , @xmath146 , is generated , where the step size , @xmath147 , is a vector of independent gaussian random variates with initial widths , @xmath148 , set to 1 . using the candidate set of coefficients , @xmath149 ,",
    "@xmath26 values are evaluated , binned , and the height of the @xmath26 distribution is assigned to parameter @xmath150 .    following the metropolis - hastings rule @xcite the candidate step",

    "otherwise , the candidate step is rejected .",
    "while the metropolis - hastings rule guarantees that the chain will converge , it does not specify _ when _ the convergence is achieved .",
    "the speed of the convergence depends on the gaussian scatter @xmath148 used to calculate the step size @xmath147 .",
    "if the scatter is too large , a large fraction of candidate steps is rejected , causing the chain to converge very slowly .",
    "if the scatter is too small , the chain behaves like a random walk , and the number of steps required to traverse some short distance in the parameter space scales as @xmath157 .",
    "the choice of optimal gaussian scatter @xmath148 ( for each fitted coefficient ) , as a function of the position in the parameter space , is not trivial and it can be very complicated even if the fitted coefficients are uncorrelated .    to determine the optimal @xmath148 values we follow the @xcite prescription ( see their appendix a ) .",
    "after every 100 accepted steps we compute the coefficient covariance matrix @xmath158 from the chain itself , diagonalize it as @xmath159 , and use it to calculate a new step size @xmath160 for each coefficient separately .",
    "we find that this transformation greatly accelerates the convergence of a chain .",
    "due to the stochastic nature of the mcmc , the best - fit relations ( coefficients with the highest @xmath144 value in a chain ) from different chains will not necessarily be the same . to quantify the intrinsic scatter between different best - fit relations , we run fifty 10,000-element long chains , and select the best - fit coefficients from each chain for subsequent comparison ( see section  [ robustness ] ) .",
    "the proper mixing and convergence of chains is confirmed using the gelman & rubin @xmath161 statistic @xcite .",
    "gelman & rubin suggest running the chains until @xmath162 for all fitted coefficients . with 10,000 elements in each chain ,",

    ", we select @xmath124 with the highest @xmath144 value among all chains as our best - fit relation . the constant term @xmath164 is not constrained with our algorithm , because @xmath164 ( from @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) cancel out when evaluating @xmath26 .",
    "instead , we constrain @xmath164 by requiring @xmath167 at @xmath168 , obtained from trigonometric parallaxes of nearby m dwarfs @xcite .      to test the robustness of our algorithm , we apply it to the mock sample described in section  [ algorithm ] .",
    "the best - fit relations ( obtained from markov chains ) are compared on a @xmath169 grid in 0.01 mag steps .",
    "we find an rms scatter of 0.05 mag between markov chains , and 0.05 mag rms scatter between the true and the best - fit relation with the highest @xmath144 value .",
    "we repeat this test with a mock sample containing @xmath170 of true binaries .",
    "the rms scatter between the best - fit relations decreases to 0.03 mag , and the rms scatter between the true and the best - fit relation with the highest @xmath144 value decreases to 0.01 mag .",
    "even when only @xmath132 of sources are true binaries ( i.e. , contamination by random pairs is @xmath137 ) our algorithm recovers the `` true '' photometric parallax relation at the 0.05 mag ( rms ) level . the accuracy of the fit increases ( to 0.01 mag rms ) as the contamination decreases ( from @xmath137 to @xmath171 ) .",
    "we apply the method described in section  [ implementation ] to two samples of candidate binaries and obtain the best - fit photometric parallax relations @xmath172",
    "@xmath173 for the geometrically- and kinematically - selected samples , respectively .",

    "the photometric parallax relations for halo stars can not be robustly constrained using geometrically- or kinematically - selected halo binaries because the color range they span is too narrow ( @xmath174 at 3 - 4 kpc , see figures  [ fig : dmvscolor ] and  [ fig:2wd ] ) .",
    "we test the correctness of the shape by studying the dependence of median @xmath26 values on the @xmath46 colors of the brighter and the fainter components .",

    "irrespective of color and the choice of the two best - fit photometric parallax relations , the deviations are confined to the 0.25 mag range , placing an upper limit on the errors in the mean shape of the adopted relations .    in figure  [ mr_ri ]",

    "the different color distributions of the two samples , shown in figure  [ geo_kin_gi1_gi2_comp ] , together with metallicity effects , is the most likely explanation for differences between the two photometric parallax relations .",
    "the scatter in @xmath26 values can be expressed as @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the scatter in predicted absolute magnitudes , and @xmath182 is the scatter in measured apparent magnitudes . since the photometric uncertainties of sdss are well understood , the intrinsic scatter around the @xmath2 relation is possible to measure and characterize .    in figure",
    "[ delta_hists ] we plot the observed distributions of @xmath26 values for the geometrically- and kinematically - selected binaries , and overplot the @xmath26 distribution of the random sample .",
    "the @xmath26 values for the random sample were calculated with equations  [ mr_geo ] and  [ mr_kin ] , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 distribution of the random sample was fitted to the observed @xmath26 distribution in the @xmath183 range using the kolmogorov - smirnov test .    by comparing the random and the observed @xmath26 distributions ,",
    "we find that the two match well for @xmath183 ( the kolmogorov - smirnov test reports @xmath184 ) , indicating that candidate binaries with @xmath183 are almost certainly random pairs . on the other hand , as @xmath26 approaches zero , the two distributions become remarkably different ( @xmath185 for @xmath186 ) , indicating that these candidate binaries are dominated by true binary systems , and not by random pairs .",
    "the @xmath26 distribution for true binaries ( figure  [ delta_hists ] , dashed line ) , obtained by subtracting the random from the observed @xmath26 distribution , is clearly not gaussian .",
    "it can be modeled as a sum of two gaussian distributions ( `` narrow '' and `` wide '' ) centered close to zero , and about 0.1 mag and 0.55 mag wide .",
    "the centers , widths , and areas for the best - fit gaussian distributions are given in table  [ gauss ] .",
    "to determine the consistency of the observed scatter with photometric errors , we normalize the @xmath26 values for the kinematically - selected sample with expected formal errors , @xmath187 and plot the @xmath188 distribution in figure  [ delta_norm ] .",
    "the @xmath188 distribution for true binaries is not a gaussian with a width of 1 , as we would expect if the scatter in the @xmath26 distribution was only due to photometric errors in the @xmath40 bands ( note that the expected random error in @xmath113 is about 5 - 10 times larger than the random error of the @xmath46 color because @xmath189 varies from @xmath9710 at the blue edge to @xmath975 at the red edge ) .",
    "the width of @xmath188 distribution for the geometrically - selected candidate binaries is about 3 times smaller than in the kinematically - selected sample .",
    "we find that this is due to _ overestimated _ photometric errors in the geometrically - selected sample , as shown in figure  [ photo_errors ] .",
    "the overestimated photometric errors in the @xmath40 bands overestimate the expected formal error @xmath190 , and the overall @xmath188 distribution is too narrow .",
    "we speculate that the small angular separation ( @xmath191 ) between the components is the cause of overestimated photometric errors ( perhaps due to sky background estimates ) .",
    "the small angular separation of components does not affect the magnitudes of stars in the geometrically - selected sample .",
    "if it did , the two @xmath26 distributions would be significantly different which , as shown in figure  [ delta_hists ] , is not the case .",
    "the observed non - gaussian scatter in predicted absolute magnitudes may be due to photometric parallax variation as a function of metallicity . as noted at the beginning of section  [ method ]",
    ", we can only estimate the `` mean '' shape of the photometric parallax relation .",
    "since the intrinsic photometric parallax for a given wide binary system is different from the mean relation , @xmath96 ( the difference of predicted absolute magnitudes ) and @xmath192 ( the measured difference of apparent magnitudes ) will differ .",
    "this discrepancy will increase for systems where the components have significantly different colors .    to test the assumption",
    "that the shape of photometric parallax relation increases the scatter in predicted absolute magnitudes , we use the mock sample constructed in section  [ algorithm ] and add a color - dependent offset to apparent magnitudes @xmath193 where @xmath155 is a random number between zero and one ( the same for both components ) .",
    "these color - dependent offsets simulate the change in the shape of the photometric parallax relation due to metallicity .",
    "we apply the algorithm described in section  [ implementation ] to the mock sample , and obtain a revised photometric parallax relation . using this relation ,",
    "we analyze the distribution of @xmath26 values and find that it can be modeled as a sum of two gaussians centered on zero , with widths of 0.1 and 0.3 mag .",
    "this result suggests that the non - gaussian scatter observed in candidate samples may be caused by the difference between the shapes of the mean photometric parallax relation and a true relation for a given metallicity ( and perhaps other effects , such as age ) .",
    "this model - based conclusion is consistent with a direct comparison of relations derived here and the relations from i08a evaluated for the median halo metallicity ( @xmath105=-1.5 $ ] ) and the median disk metallicity ( @xmath105=-0.7 $ ] for distances probed by our sample ; see figure  5 in the above paper ) .",
    "the two relations corresponding to halo and disk stars are offset by 0.6 mag due to metallicity difference .",
    "our relations match the low - metallicity relation at the blue end and the high - metallicity relation at the red end .",
    "therefore , in the worst case scenario of extremely blue ( @xmath194 ) and red ( @xmath195 ) disk stars , the maximum error in the difference of their absolute magnitudes is 0.6 mag . when convolved with the observed color distribution of pairs , the expected scatter is about 0.2 - 0.3 mag , consistent with the observed and simulated widths of the @xmath26 distributions .",
    "unresolved binarity of components in candidate samples may also contribute to the non - gaussian scatter in predicted absolute magnitudes .",
    "the multiplicity studies of g dwarfs @xcite and m dwarfs @xcite find that a significant fraction of g and m dwarf stars ( @xmath196 ) are unresolved binary systems .",
    "if a component of a wide binary system is an unresolved binary system , its luminosity will be underestimated ( with the magnitude of the offset depending on the actual composition of the binary ) and the @xmath26 value for the wide binary system will systematically deviate from zero . in appendix  [ model ]",
    "we model the presence of unresolved binaries in wide binary systems , and find that the model can explain the observed @xmath26 scatter .",
    "therefore , both the intrinsic variations of the photometric parallax relation and unresolved binaries can explain the observed non - gaussian scatter of @xmath26 .",
    "the data discussed here are insufficient to disentangle these two effects .",
    "finally , the uncertainty in predicted absolute magnitudes ( error distribution for photometric parallax method ) can be obtained by drawing random values , @xmath197 , from a non - gaussian distribution @xmath198 where @xmath199 are gaussian distributions , and the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ gauss ] .",
    "the best - fit photometric parallax relation can be utilized to further refine the samples of candidate binaries and to address questions about their dynamical and physical properties such as    * do wide binaries have the same spatial distribution as single stars ? * do wide binaries have the same color distribution as single stars ?",
    "* are the color distributions of components in wide binary systems consistent with random pairings ? * what is the distribution of semi - major axis for wide binaries ? *",
    "does the distribution of semi - major axis vary with the position in the galaxy ?      we use the best - fit photometric parallax relations to select samples of candidate binaries with high selection efficiency ( high fraction of true binaries ) by imposing further constraints on @xmath26 values in geometric and kinematic sample .    as shown in figure  [ delta_hists ] , the fraction of random pairs in the candidate sample is simply @xmath200 , where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the integrals of the random ( triangles ) and total ( thick solid line ) @xmath26 distributions .",
    "the fraction of true binaries , or the _ selection efficiency _",
    ", is then @xmath203 without a cut on @xmath26 , the fraction of true binaries ( the selection efficiency ) in the geometrically- and kinematically - selected samples is @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively .",
    "it is reassuring to find that the @xmath206 value for the geometrically - selected sample obtained here , and the one measured in section  [ geo_select ] match so well ( at a @xmath207 level ) , even though the two methods for estimating @xmath206 are independent .",
    "the selection efficiency of @xmath205 for the kinematically - selected sample may seem low , given that only @xmath208 of random pairs pass the common proper motion criteria .",
    "this points to a low fraction of true binaries with angular separation greater than @xmath209 .",
    "if this fraction is about 1/400 ( @xmath210 ) , the common proper motion criteria will select 2 random pairs ( 0.5% out of a 400 ) , and only 1 true binary system .",
    "therefore , @xmath211 of the sample ( 2 out of 3 ) will be random pairs , and @xmath204 ( 1 out of 3 ) will be true binary systems , similar to what we find for the kinematically - selected sample .",
    "the result that only 1/400 pairs with @xmath75 are true binaries puts the fraction of random pairs in the random sample at @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ delta_hists ] shows that the true binaries have a much smaller range of @xmath26 values than the random pairs .",
    "therefore , a cut on @xmath26 would reduce the contamination , and increase the fraction of true binaries in a sample . by requiring @xmath175",
    ", we construct samples where @xmath212 and @xmath213 of candidates are true binaries .",
    "the numbers of candidate binaries in these cleaner samples are 16,575 ( geometrically - selected ) and 5,157 candidates ( kinematically - selected ) , with the expected total number of true binaries about 13,743 .",
    "the sample efficiency for the geometric sample can be further increased to 90% by requiring @xmath214 and @xmath215 kpc , where @xmath13 is the height above the galactic plane .",
    "compared to the existing catalogs of wide binaries by @xcite and @xcite , our samples represent a 20-fold increase in the number of candidate binaries and probe much deeper into the halo ( to @xmath216 kpc ) .",
    "although a non - negligible fraction of candidate pairs are due to random pairings ( @xmath67 ) , the increase in the number of potential physical pairs is substantial .",
    "we emphasize that our method only selects candidates where both components are _ main - sequence _ stars , while rejecting systems where one of the components has evolved off the main sequence .",
    "this is due to the photometric parallax relation , as defined here , being correct for main - sequence stars only .",
    "together with the small expected fraction of giant stars in our sample due to faint apparent magnitudes ( 1 - 2% , @xcite ; i08a ) , this bias results in practically pure main - sequence sample .",
    "we note that the application of a photometric parallax relation that corresponds to some mean metallicity distribution introduces systematic errors in estimated @xmath113 .",
    "we partially mitigate this problem by averaging distances determined for each binary component ( using equation  [ mr_geo ] ) .",
    "based on the behavior of photometric parallax relations and @xmath26 distribution discussed in section  [ scatter ] , the systematic uncertainty in obtained distances is most likely not larger than 10 - 15% ( an understimate due to faint bias for blue stars ) .",
    "another source of overall systematic uncertainty in distances is the normalization of equation  [ mr_geo ] adopted from @xcite .",
    "this normalization corresponds to nearby ( @xmath121100 pc ) metal - rich stars , while most stars in our sample are distances of the order 1 kpc .",
    "the disk metallicity gradient discussed by i08a implies systematic distance overestimate of about 10 - 20% , partially cancelling the above underestimate .",
    "these systematic uncertainties propagate as systematic uncertainties of derived semi - major axes discussed in section  [ spatial ] .",
    "the luminosity of a main - sequence star , and thus its color via photometric parallax relation , can be used as a proxy for stellar mass .",
    "the color - color distribution of wide binaries , therefore , provides constraints on the distribution of stellar masses in wide binary systems . to find the color distribution of wide binaries , we select a volume - complete ( @xmath217 ) subsample of geometrically - selected candidate binaries with @xmath175 , and plot their distribution in the @xmath90 vs.  @xmath89 color - color diagram in figure  [ counts_0.7_1.0 ] ( _ top _ ) .",

    "are still random pairs that contaminate the map . to remove the contamination , first we select pairs from the random sample ( see the end of section  [ initial_select ] ) with @xmath175 and @xmath220 .",
    "the @xmath175 cut on the random sample will not increase the fraction of true binaries ( @xmath206 ) above @xmath221 because @xmath206 decreases rapidly with @xmath50 ( see figure  [ logz_plots ] ( _ middle left _ ) in section  [ spatial ] ) , and the pairs in the random sample have @xmath222 .",

    "because the sample is dominated by stars at high galactic latitudes , it is hard to disentangle the @xmath13 dependence from the other two effects ( the @xmath161 range is small , and @xmath296 varies strongly with @xmath13 ) .",
    "we attempt to do so using the volume - complete @xmath275 sample .",
    "first we divide this sample into three subsamples with median galactic latitudes , @xmath297 , of @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 and determine @xmath12 for each subsample .",

    "the fraction of binaries relative to the number of all stars , shown in the bottom right panel , changes by only a factor of 2 over a range of 3 kpc , starting from @xmath305 at @xmath306 pc and declining to @xmath208 at @xmath307 pc",
    ".      it would be informative to repeat the @xmath234 and @xmath12 analysis using kinematically - selected binaries , but unfortunately , the apparent incompleteness of sdss - poss proper motion data at @xmath85 prevents us in doing so .",
    "as shown in figure  [ theta_fit_500pc ] , the number of common proper motion pairs drops sharply below @xmath308 , probably due to blending of close sources in the poss data . because of this @xmath50 cut - off , for the same range in @xmath13 , the effective @xmath256 for the kinematic sample is three times that of the geometric sample ( where the lower limit on @xmath50 is @xmath103 ) . in the case of @xmath288 sample",
    "observed here , the smallest probed semi - major axis ( @xmath256 ) is at 5079 au , well above the @xmath12 value of 4534 au predicted by the @xmath309 relation .",
    "since we are outside the range where od is valid , we can not measure where the turnover in @xmath234 happens , and can not determine @xmath12 or @xmath266 .",
    "in all the other @xmath13 bins , @xmath256 is also above the predicted @xmath12 value , and therefore outside the pik regime .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to photometric parallax estimation based on samples of candidate wide binaries selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) imaging catalog .",
    "our approach uses the fact that binary system s components are at equal distances and estimates the photometric parallax relation for main - sequence stars by minimizing the difference of their distance moduli . while this method is similar to constraints on photometric parallax relation obtained from globular clusters in that it does not require absolute distance estimates , it has the advantage that it extends to redder colors than available for globular clusters observed by the sdss , and it implicitly accounts for the metallicity effects .",
    "the derived best - fit photometric parallax relations represent metallicity - averaged relations and thus provide an independent confirmation of relations proposed by j08 in their study of the galactic structure .",
    "an important result of this work is our estimate of the expected error distribution for absolute magnitudes determined from photometric parallax relations ( a root - mean - square scatter of @xmath970.3 mag , see section  [ scatter ] ) , which is in good agreement with modeling assumptions adopted by j08 .",
    "the mildly non - gaussian error distribution is consistent with both the impact of unresolved binary stars , and the variation of photometric parallax relation with metallicity ; we are unable to disentangle these two effects .",
    "the best - fit photometric parallax relations enabled the selection of high - efficiency samples of disk wide binaries with @xmath310 candidates , that include about 14,000 true binary systems ( efficiency of @xmath311 ) . using the photometric measurements and angular distance of the two components , samples with efficiency exceeding 80%",
    "can be constructed ( see section  [ samples ] ) .",
    "such samples could be used as a starting point to further increase the selection efficiency with the aid of radial velocity measurements .",
    "spectral observations of systems where the brighter component is an f / g star , for which it is easy to estimate metallicity , could be used to calibrate both spectroscopic and photometric methods for estimating metallicity of cooler k and m dwarfs .",
    "compared to the state - of - the - art catalogs of wide binaries by @xcite and @xcite , the samples discussed here represent a significant increase in the number of potential binaries , and probe larger distances ( to @xmath216 kpc ) . to facilitate further studies of wide binaries",
    ", we make the catalog publicly available .",
    "using the high - efficiency subsamples , we analyzed their dynamical and physical properties .",
    "we find that the spatial distribution of wide binaries follows the distribution of single stars to within a factor of 2 , and that the probability for a star to be in a wide binary system is independent of its color .",
    "however , given this color , the companions of red components seem to be drawn randomly from the stellar luminosity function , while blue components have a larger blue - to - red companion ratio than expected from luminosity function ( see section  [ color ] ) .",
    "these results are consistent with recent results by @xcite , and provide strong constraints for the scenarios describing the formation of such systems ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also study the semi - major axis distribution of wide binaries in the @xmath312 au range ( see section  [ spatial ] ) . the observed distribution",
    "is well described by the pik distribution , @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 increases roughly linearly with the height above the galactic plane ( @xmath313 au at @xmath314 kpc ) .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath12 correlates with the local number density of stars as @xmath315 , but we are unable to robustly identify the dominant correlation ( @xmath13 and @xmath296 are highly correlated ) .",
    "the distribution of semi - major axes for wide binaries was also discussed by @xcite .",
    "they used a sample of wide binaries selected using common proper motion from the rnltt catalog @xcite , and found @xmath316 , with no evidence of a turnover at @xmath317 .",
    "their sample extended to larger angular separations than ours , and probed smaller distances . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite used wide binaries from the same @xcite sample , and detected pik distribution , @xmath10 , for @xmath318 , consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "in a recent study , lpine & bongiorno searched for faint common proper motion companions of hipparcos stars and detected a turnover from pik distribution to a steeper distribution around @xmath319 au .",
    "their sample also probed much smaller distances than ours .",
    "we compare these results in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "as evident , the variation of @xmath12 with distance from the galactic plane detected here ( approximately with distance , as shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] , since stars in our sample are mostly at high galactic latitudes ) , is consistent with the above results that are based on more local samples .",
    "in particular , this comparison of different studies suggests that the flattening of @xmath234 for small @xmath8 that `` puzzled '' chanam & gould ( see their section 4.3 ) is probably due to a combination of selection effects and the approach of the domain where pik distribution is valid in their sample .",
    "the pik distribution suggests that the process of star formation produces multiple stars , which evolve towards binaries after ejecting one or more single stars @xcite .",
    "the departure from the pik distribution may be evidence for disruption of wide binaries over long periods of time by passing stars , giant molecular clouds , massive compact halo objects ( machos ) , or disk and galactic tides @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath315 correlation ( see figure  [ logz_plots ] ) is outside the expected range discussed by @xcite ( @xmath320 for close strong encounters , and @xmath321 for weak encounters )",
    ".    the samples presented here can be further refined and enlarged .",
    "first , the sdss covers only a quarter of the sky . upcoming next - generation surveys , such as the skymapper @xcite , the dark energy survey @xcite , pan - starrs @xcite and the large synoptic survey telescope ( @xcite , lsst hereafter ) , will enable the construction of such samples over most of the sky . due to fainter flux limits ( especially for the pan - starrs and lsst )",
    ", the samples will probe a larger distance range and will reach the halo - dominated parts of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , due to improved photometry and seeing ( e.g. , for the lsst , by about a factor of two ) , the selection will be more robust .",
    "we scale the 20,000 candidates discussed here , assuming @xmath322 , to the lsst depth that enables accurate photometric metallicity ( @xmath323 ; i08a ) and predict a minimum sample size of @xmath97400,000 candidate wide binary systems in 20,000 deg@xmath33 of sky .",
    "it is likely that the sample would include more than a million systems due to the increase of the stellar counts close to the galactic plane .",
    "another important development will come from the gaia mission @xcite , which will provide direct trigonometric distances for stars with @xmath324 . with trigonometric distances",
    ", accurate photometric parallax relation can be used to provide strong constraints on the incidence and color distribution of unresolved multiple systems . until then , a radial velocity survey of candidate binaries assembled here could help with pruning the sample from random associations , and with better characterization of various selection effects .",

    "recent analysis of metallicity and kinematics for halo and disk stars by i08a provides sufficient information to understand the behavior of the reduced proper motion diagram in quantitative detail ( including both the sequence separation and their widths ) , and to demonstrate that its efficiency for separating halo and disk stars deteriorates at distances beyond a few kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "as equation  [ eq : rpm2 ] shows , for a population of stars with the same @xmath114 , the reduced proper motion is a measure of their absolute magnitude . for two stars with the same color that is sensitive to the effective temperature ( such as the @xmath46 color ) , but with different metallicities and tangential velocities , the difference in their reduced proper motions is @xmath325 where @xmath326 and @xmath94 denote the two stars . in the limit that the _ shape _ of the photometric parallax relation does not depend on metallicity ,",
    "@xmath327 does not depend on color , and is fully determined by the metallicity difference of the two stars ( or populations of stars ) .",
    "using metallicity distributions for disk and halo stars obtained by i08a , and their expression for @xmath328)$ ] ( equation  a2 ) , we find that the expected offset between @xmath113 for halo and disk stars with the same @xmath46 color varies from 0.6 mag for stars at 1 kpc from the galactic plane to 0.7 mag at 5 kpc from the plane , where the variation is due to the vertical metallicity gradient for disk stars",
    ". the finite width of halo and disk metallicity distributions induces a spread of @xmath113 ( root - mean - square scatter computed using interquartile range ) of 0.15 mag for disk stars and 0.18 mag for halo stars .",
    "the effect of metallicity on the separation of halo and disk sequences in the reduced proper motion diagram is smaller than the effect of different tangential velocity distributions .",
    "assuming for simplicity that stars are observed towards a galactic pole , and that the median heliocentric tangential velocities are 30 km s@xmath37 for disk stars and 200 km s@xmath37 for halo stars , the induced separation of their reduced proper motion sequences is @xmath974.1 mag ( the expected scatter in the reduced proper motion due to finite velocity dispersion is @xmath971 - 1.5 mag ) .",
    "together with the @xmath329 mag offset due to different metallicity distributions , the separation of @xmath975 mag between the two sequences makes the reduced proper motion diagram a promising tool for separating disk and halo stars .",
    "however , the reduced proper motion diagram is an efficient tool only for stars within 1 - 2 kpc from the galactic plane .",
    "the main reason for this limitation is the decrease of rotational velocity for disk stars with distance from the galactic plane , with a gradient of about @xmath330 km s@xmath37 kpc@xmath37 ( see section 3.4.2 in i08a ) .",
    "as the difference in rotational velocity between halo and disk stars diminishes with the distance from the plane , the separation of their reduced proper motion sequences decreases , too . a mild increase in the velocity dispersion of disk stars , as well as a decrease of their median metallicity with the distance from the plane , also decrease the sequence separation , but the dominant cause is the rotational velocity gradient .    to illustrate this effect",
    ", we select a sample of @xmath9760,000 stars with @xmath331 and @xmath332 , that are observed towards the north galactic pole ( @xmath99 ) . in this color range",
    "it is possible to separate disk and halo stars using photometric metallicity estimator from i08a , and we further select a sample of @xmath9716,000 likely disk stars with @xmath333 > -0.9 $ ] , and a sample of @xmath9734,400 likely halo stars with @xmath333 < -1.1 $ ] ( see figure  9 in i08a for justification ) . their proper motion distributions as functions of distance from the galactic plane , @xmath13 , are shown in the top left panel in figure  [ fig : app1 ] . because of the gradient in the rotational velocity for disk stars , their median proper motion becomes constant at @xmath978 mas yr@xmath37 beyond @xmath334 kpc , while the median proper motion for halo stars is roughly proportional to @xmath335 , with a value of @xmath9711 mas yr@xmath37 at @xmath336 kpc .",
    "the top right panel in figure  [ fig : app1 ] shows the positions and widths of the reduced proper motion sequences for disk and halo stars as functions of @xmath13 , and the two bottom panels show the sequence cross - sections for stars with @xmath337 kpc and @xmath338 kpc . at distances beyond @xmath972 kpc from the plane ,",
    "the reduced proper motion diagram ceases to be an efficient tool for separating halo and disk stars because the two sequences start to significantly overlap .",
    "this increasing overlap is a result of the rotational velocity gradient for disk stars , and the finite width of halo and disk velocity distributions , and would be present even for _ infinitely accurate _ measurements ( with the proper motion errors of @xmath973 mas yr@xmath37 per coordinate , @xcite , the sequence widths of @xmath971.0 - 1.5 mag are dominated by velocity dispersions ) .",
    "hence , beyond @xmath972 kpc from the plane , metallicity measurements are necessary to reliably separate disk and halo populations .",
    "the above analysis is strictly valid only for fields towards the north galactic pole .",
    "@xcite found that the position of disk and halo reduced proper motion sequences , relative to their positions at the north galactic pole , varies with galactic latitude as @xmath339 where @xmath340 is the median value of @xmath114 for stars observed towards the north galactic pole .",
    "this result is a bit unexpected because it does not contain longitudinal variation due to projection effects of the rotational motion of the local standard of rest .",
    "we show the variation of @xmath341 , for stars with @xmath332 , as a function of galactic coordinates in figure  [ fig : app2 ] .",
    "we use photometric metallicity to separate stars into disk and halo populations .",
    "as figure demonstrates , the longitudinal dependence is present for halo sample , but not for disk samples .",
    "we have generated simulated behavior of @xmath341 using kinematic model from i08a , and reproduced the observed behavior to within the measurement noise .",
    "it turns out that the vertical gradient of rotational velocity for disk stars is fully responsible for the observed strong dependence of @xmath341 on latitude , and which masks the dependence on longitude .",
    "hence , the @xmath342 term proposed by @xcite is an indirect discovery of the vertical gradient of rotational velocity for disk stars !",
    "these empirical models also show that a linear dependence of @xmath343 on @xmath342 is only approximately correct , and that it ignores the dependence on distance . while a more involved best - fit expression is possible ( full two - dimensional consideration of proper motion also helps to better separate disk and halo stars ) , we find that halo stars can always be efficiently rejected at @xmath344 , if the separator shown in figure  [ fig:1wd ] is shifted upwards by 1 mag .",
    "one major uncertainty when using a photometric parallax relation is the lack of information whether the observed `` star '' is a single star , or a binary ( multiple ) system .",
    "if the observed `` star '' is a binary system , its luminosity will be underestimated , with the magnitude of the offset depending on the actual composition of the binary . to model this offset , or to correct for it",
    ", one would ideally like to have a probability density map that gives the probability of a magnitude offset , @xmath327 , as a function of the _ observed _ binary system s color .",
    "to construct such a map , we have generated a sample of 100,000 unresolved binary systems by randomly pairing stars drawn from the @xcite luminosity function . by independently drawing the luminosities of each component to generate unresolved binary systems",
    ", we implicitly assume that the formation of each component is unaffected by the presence of the other . while there are other proposed mechanisms for binary formation ( @xcite , and references therein ) , we have chosen this one because it was easy to implement .    for every unresolved binary system",
    "we calculate the total @xmath30 band luminosity , and the @xmath122 and @xmath46 color of the system .",
    "the magnitude offset , @xmath327 , caused by unresolved binarity , is obtained as the difference between the true @xmath30 band absolute magnitude , and the absolute magnitude for the pair s joint @xmath122 color calculated using equation  [ mr_bright ] .",
    "the probability density map is then simply the number of unresolved binary systems ( normalized with the total number of systems at a given color ) as a function of @xmath327 and pair s joint @xmath46 color , shown in figure  [ dmr_gi ] .",
    "it is worth noting that , with the adopted binary formation mechanism , the magnitude offset is the smallest ( @xmath345 mag ) for the bluest stars , and greatest ( @xmath346 mag ) for the reddest stars . because of this , the scatter due to unresolved binarity in the @xmath26 distribution should be more pronounced in a sample of red stars ( @xmath347 ) , than in a sample of blue stars .",
    "the map shown in figure  [ dmr_gi ] can be parametrized as a gaussian distribution @xmath348 , where @xmath349 is the median @xmath327 , and @xmath350 is the scatter ( determined from the interquartile range ) . to verify the validity of this parametrization",
    ", we subtract @xmath327 and @xmath109 , normalize the difference with @xmath148 , find the distribution of such values , and fit a gaussian to it . as shown in figure  [ dmr_chi_gauss ] , the distribution of normalized residuals is well described by a gaussian with @xmath351 .",
    "the two peaks in the distribution are due to highly asymmetric distributions of @xmath327 values around the median @xmath327 for the bluest ( @xmath352 ) and reddest ( @xmath353 ) systems .    to create a sample of wide binaries where some of the stars are unresolved binary systems , first we select pairs with @xmath58 from the initial sample of stellar pairs . following the procedure described in section  [ algorithm ] , we create the `` true '' wide binaries by changing the @xmath92 magnitude using equation  [ r2_mag ] , and add 0.15 mag of gaussian noise to simulate the scatter in the photometric parallax due to photometric errors .",
    "a fraction of stars is then randomly converted to unresolved binary systems by subtracting a @xmath327 value from the @xmath30 band ( apparent ) magnitude , where the @xmath327 is drawn from a @xmath46 color - dependent @xmath348 distribution .",
    "figure  [ gauss_fit_red ] shows the @xmath26 distribution for such a mock sample , where the components are redder than @xmath354 and have a 40% probability to be unresolved binary systems .",
    "different configurations of single stars and unresolved binaries that contribute to the observed @xmath26 distribution can be easily identified .",
    "wide binaries where both components are single stars contribute the central narrow gaussian , with its width due to photometric errors .",
    "if the brighter component is an unresolved binary system , its absolute magnitude is underestimated , and the result is an offset in @xmath26 in the negative direction .",
    "a similar outcome happens if the fainter component is an unresolved binary system , but the offset is positive .",
    "single star - unresolved binary configurations , therefore , contribute the left and the right gaussians .",
    "if both components are unresolved binary systems , the @xmath26 will be centered on zero and will be @xmath355 wide , where @xmath356 is the width of the @xmath357 distribution .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the @xmath26 distributions observed in figure  [ delta_hists ] .",

    "<S> using sdss data release 6 , we construct two independent samples of candidate stellar wide binaries selected as i ) pairs of unresolved sources with angular separation in the range @xmath0 , ii ) common proper motion pairs with @xmath1 angular separation , and make them publicly available . these samples are dominated by disk stars , and we use them to constrain the shape of the main - sequence photometric parallax relation @xmath2 , and to study the properties of wide binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath2 by searching for a relation that minimizes the difference between distance moduli of primary and secondary components of wide binary candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we model @xmath2 by a fourth degree polynomial and determine the coefficients using markov chain monte carlo fitting , independently for each sample . </S>",
    "<S> both samples yield similar relations , with the largest systematic difference of 0.25 mag for f0 to m5 stars , and a root - mean - square scatter of 0.13 mag . a similar level of agreement is obtained with photometric parallax relations recently proposed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements show a root - mean - square scatter of @xmath3 mag around the best fit @xmath2 relation , and a mildly non - gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this scatter to metallicity effects and additional unresolved multiplicity of wide binary components . </S>",
    "<S> aided by the derived photometric parallax relation , we construct a series of high - quality catalogs of candidate main - sequence binary stars . </S>",
    "<S> these range from a sample of @xmath4 candidates with the probability of each pair to be a physical binary ( the `` efficiency '' ) of @xmath5 , to a volume - limited sample of @xmath6 candidates with an efficiency of @xmath7 . using these catalogs </S>",
    "<S> , we study the distribution of semi - major axes of wide binaries , @xmath8 , in the @xmath9  au range . we find the observations to be well described by the pik distribution , @xmath10 , for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 increases roughly linearly with the height @xmath13 above the galactic plane ( @xmath14}^{0.7}$ ]  au ) . the number of wide binary systems with @xmath15 , as a fraction of the total number of stars , decreases from 0.9% at @xmath16 kpc to 0.5% at @xmath17 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the probability for a star to be in a wide binary system is independent of its color . given this color , the companions of red components seem to be drawn randomly from the stellar luminosity function , while blue components have a larger blue - to - red companion ratio than expected from luminosity function . </S>"
