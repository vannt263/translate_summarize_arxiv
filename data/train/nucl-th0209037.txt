    "in environments of very high neutron flux the ultimate yields from the chains of nuclear reactions depend not only on the cross sections of nuclei in their ground states but also , to less or greater degree , on the cross sections of excited states . in stars at high temperatures ,",
    "the states involved will depend on the boltzmann distribution of excitation while in more transient situations , such as nuclear explosions , the longer - lived isomeric states will play key roles .",
    "long lived isomers are difficult to populate electromagnetically in a hot dense plasma . however , they can be populated strongly via neutron capture , and if the neutron energies are high enough , by inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "an especially interesting example is that of @xmath0u , which has an isomer at only 77 ev excitation with a half - life of 26 m. the thermal neutron fission cross section of this isomer has been measured @xcite and found to be about twice the value of the nucleus in its ground state .",
    "this has led to the speculation that the cross section may also be higher for fast neutrons thus enhancing the fission yield in a transient , extremely high neutron flux .",
    "equally , a lower cross section would diminish the yield .",
    "since there is no method available at present to measure the fast neutron cross section of the isomer , a theoretical evaluation is required to answer this question .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform detailed calculations of the fission cross sections for the ground state and isomeric state of @xmath0u .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0u has spin and parity 7/2@xmath6 , while the isomer is 1/2@xmath7 .",
    "the latter is the same as the ground state of @xmath5pu , which has a gross fission barrier height ( relative to the neutron separation energy ) very similar to that of @xmath0u .",
    "it is therefore pertinent as part of this investigation to determine the main physics distinguishing the magnitude and energy dependence of the fission cross sections of @xmath0u and @xmath5pu .",
    "the task involves the assessment of the main features of the double - humped fission barrier ( barrier heights and penetrability parameters ) from available data relating to the fission of the compound nucleus @xmath8u .",
    "these parameters are somewhat dependent on models of the transition states at the barrier peaks .",
    "therefore , a range of models was considered , adjustments made to obtain reasonable agreement with the measured fission cross section of @xmath0u , and calculations made of the corresponding cross section of the isomeric state .",
    "for the models investigated , the fission cross- section of the isomer is calculated to be substantially lower ( by about @xmath9 ) than that of the ground state over a significant part of the neutron energy range ( 0 to @xmath10 0.5mev ) .",
    "this work is described in section ii .",
    "using analysis of the same kinds of data as for the uranium isotope , barrier parameters were established for plausible models of the barrier transition states of the compound nucleus @xmath11pu , and from these parameters the fission cross section of @xmath5pu was calculated .",
    "this was found to agree well with the measured cross section .",
    "similar calculations were carried out for the cross sections of @xmath3u and @xmath4u .",
    "these odd mass neighbors of @xmath0u are expected to have similar barrier properties , while @xmath4u , like @xmath5pu , has the same spin and parity as the @xmath0u isomer .",
    "these studies help give confidence that we have sound understanding of the barrier and transition state systematics of this whole group of nuclei .",
    "this work is described in section iii .",
    "at moderately high excitation energies ( up to the order of 10 mev ) hauser - feshbach theory@xcite is used for calculating cross sections . in this",
    ", the cross section is separated into its components of total angular momentum and parity , and each component is proportional to a spin - weighting factor multiplied by the ratio of the product of transmission coefficients @xmath12 for the entrance and exit channels and the sum over transmission coefficients for all channels . in its more sophisticated form extra factors",
    "have to be included to account for the statistical fluctuations of the partial widths of the underlying compound nucleus levels :    @xmath13    labels @xmath14 refer to the entrance channel @xmath15 in its different possible spin combinations , @xmath16 to the outgoing channel @xmath17 in spin combinations o , @xmath18 is the de broglie wavelength divided by @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the fluctuation averaging factor .",
    "dresner@xcite has derived a numerical integral that can be used for the evaluation of @xmath21 in the general case when one channel ( or , in practice , a large group of channels such as those accounting for radiative capture ) is constant for individual compound nucleus levels while for each of the remaining channels the statistical distribution function over levels is a member of the @xmath22 family .    for neutrons with energies up",
    "to about 1 mev bombarding very long - lived and well - studied actinide target nuclei such as @xmath0u , the transmission coefficients for the entrance neutron channel and individual inelastic channels can be calculated with considerable confidence . alternatively , and this is the procedure adopted here , we can use the experimental information on @xmath23-wave and @xmath24-wave neutron strength functions .",
    "the radiation widths are known with reasonable accuracy in the slow neutron resonance region and can be extrapolated using simple statistical models of the radiation process .",
    "the chief difficulty in applying the hauser - feshbach theory to the fissionable nuclei lies in the nature of the fission process .",
    "it is well - known that the fission barriers of the actinide group of nuclides are double- humped in their functional dependence on deformation .",
    "this contrasts with the single hump or maximum in the potential energy given by the liquid drop model of fission .",
    "a double - humped barrier has many consequences on the fission cross section as a result of the subtle inter - play of the two maxima and makes analysis of the data a complicated and not always unambiguous one .",
    "it is not only in the one variable ( `` prolate '' deformation towards elongation and division ) that the potential energy departs from the classical liquid - drop form .",
    "it is well - established that at the outer barrier of the fission path the nucleus is unstable to octupole deformations and the saddle - point here is at a mass - asymmetric shape .",
    "there is also strong , though indirect , evidence that at the inner barrier the nucleus is unstable to axial deformations .",
    "these different shapes affect the energies of the transition states ( also known as bohr channels , after the introduction of the concept by a.bohr @xcite ) , the states of collective and quasi - particle excitation in which the nucleus passes over the barrier saddle - point .",
    "once the transition states are established , by either experimental evidence or hypothesis , the transmission coefficients for each barrier can be calculated , and from these we can calculate the overall fission transmission coefficient .    at excitation energies well above the barriers , the fission transmission coefficient , @xmath25 , has the strutinsky statistical form @xcite that simply relates the overall transmission to the separate transmission coefficients for crossing the inner and outer barriers , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "@xmath28    the coefficients @xmath29 are given by the bohr and wheeler prescriptions of the sum of transition states @xcite each multiplied by a barrier penetrability factor : @xmath30}\\ ] ]    ( and similarly for @xmath27 ) .",
    "in eq.4 the penetrability factor is the hill - wheeler formula @xcite for a barrier with parabolic form equivalent to an inverted harmonic oscillator with circular frequency @xmath31 is the excitation energy , @xmath32 is the inner barrier height and the @xmath33 are the energies of the transition states @xmath34 above the inner barrier .",
    "a similar equation can be written for the outer barrier .",
    "it is possible to define transmission coefficients for individual transition states @xmath34 : @xmath35    these , with their appropriate quantum numbers , are important for calculating cross sections for more specific properties of the fission reaction , such as fission product angular distributions .    at lower energies the intermediate structure due to compound- nucleus - type levels ( class - ii states @xcite ) associated with the deformation of the secondary well between the inner and outer barrier peaks",
    "must be taken into account . by concentrating the fission strength into narrow energy regions these lower the average fission probability @xcite",
    "also the effect of porter - thomas fluctuations both in the fine - structure compound - nucleus levels ( class - i levels ) and the class - ii levels must be taken into account .",
    "these fluctuation effects are discussed in ref.@xcite , where analytic and numerical results have been established for a few limiting cases .    in the present work fluctuation averaging has been studied much more extensively .",
    "from the transmission coefficients @xmath36 the mean coupling and fission widths @xmath37 , respectively , of the class - ii levels are obtained : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean class - ii level spacing .",
    "monte carlo techniques have been used for selection of the parameters ( coupling widths , fission widths and individual spacings ) of the individual class - ii levels from porter - thomas distributions and , using the select class - ii coupling width values , the coupling matrix elements with the class - i levels ( for which spacings and reduced neutron widths were also selected using pseudo - random numbers ) were drawn from zero - mean gaussian distributions .",
    "solution of the eigenvalue problem then gave the parameters for the resonance fine structure , from which the detailed cross section could be computed and averaged .",
    "comparison of these results with the formula @xcite based on a uniform picket fence model of the intermediate and fine structure gives the fluctuation averaging factor .",
    "the uniform picket fence formula for the fission probability is @xmath40}^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the mean total width of the class - i levels .",
    "when the mean class - ii width is much less than the class - ii level spacing , eq .",
    "8 gives a fission probability up to an order of magnitude lower than the value deduced from the hauser - feshbach formula with the statistical expression , eq .",
    "5 , for the fission transmission coefficient .",
    "inclusion of the fluctuation averaging factor can reduce the fission probability by up to another factor of three of more .    in the case of overlapping intermediate resonances ( @xmath43 eq .",
    "8 gives the statistical result . even in this case , however , when the intermediate structure is washed out the class - ii level fluctuations should be taken into account in the evaluation of the fission transmission coefficients of eq .",
    "this is done here using the dresner numerical integral technique applied to eq.5 .",
    "the individual transition state components of @xmath27 are governed by independent porter - thomas distributions .",
    "although the magnitude of @xmath26 is governed by the transition states across the inner barrier , its fluctuation properties are governed by the degree of overlap of the class - ii resonances .",
    "the frequency distribution is assumed to be a member of the chi - squared family with @xmath44 degrees of freedom .",
    "the value of @xmath44 is evaluated from a picket - fence model of the class - ii states . for large @xmath26",
    "the value of @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "the monte carlo method for calculating the overall fluctuation averaging factor in the intermediate structure case is too time consuming to apply in a full calculation of the neutron cross- sections .",
    "however , we find that if we apply the product of the separate fluctuation factors for the fission transmission coefficient , eq.5 , and for the fine structure in the hauser - feshbach formula to the intermediate structure fission probability , eq.8 , we obtain a quite good approximation to the monte carlo result .",
    "it is this approximation that we use in general in calculating neutron cross- sections , although we have frequently used the more exact monte carlo method for calculating the fission probability below the neutron separation energy in the analysis of @xmath46 and @xmath47 data for deduction of fission barrier heights .",
    "the overall systematics of the fission barrier parameters of the actinides were established in a review by bjornholm and lynn @xcite . since",
    "that work variations on the detailed parameters of specific nuclides have been published by other authors , but our understanding of the broad trends remains unchanged .",
    "inner barrier heights ( denoted by @xmath32 ) vary little over the range @xmath48 to @xmath49 for a given parity class . for the double - even parity class the barrier height for the uranium isotopes and their neighbors is about 5.5 mev . for even - odd ( or odd - even ) and double - odd nuclides the inner barrier is about 0.5 and 1 mev higher , respectively . outer barrier heights ( denoted by @xmath50 )",
    "vary strongly with proton number . for the uranium nuclides they are about the same as the inner barriers , whereas for plutonium they are about 0.5 mev lower . from a gross point of view",
    "the overall barrier heights of the compound nuclei @xmath8u and @xmath11pu are very similar , as are their neutron separation energies , leading to the simple expectation that the neutron - induced fission cross sections of @xmath0u and @xmath5pu should be similar .",
    "in fact the different relative heights of the inner and outer barriers lead to considerable differences in the cross sections of the two nuclides .",
    "the energies , total angular momenta and parities @xmath51 of the transition states are as important as the barrier heights in the fission process .",
    "these are largely extrapolated from the nuclear spectroscopy known for the ground state deformation . for double - even fissioning nuclides",
    "the lowest transition state , at both barriers , is , of course , the ` ground state ' at the barrier deformation , with excitation energy zero and @xmath52 . built on this is a rotational band with @xmath53 etc .",
    ", with rotational moment of inertia @xmath54 inferred to be about twice , for the inner , and thrice , for the outer barrier , of that of the ground state .",
    "thus , the transition state energies are    @xmath55    with respect to the barrier height . above the ` ground ' transition state",
    "there is , in even nuclides , an energy gap , which could be significantly larger than 1 mev , that is devoid of quasi - particle excitations . in this energy gap , however , it is expected that there will be collective vibrations each with its own rotational band .",
    "the beta - vibrations are the best known of these from nuclear spectroscopy , but , being vibrations in the prolate deformation variable , which becomes largely the fission degree of freedom , they do not enter into consideration of the transition states .    apart from the beta - vibrations , there is strong spectroscopic evidence for the gamma- vibrations , which are vibrations about axial symmetry , with spin - projection along the prolate deformation symmetry axis and parity @xmath56 .",
    "the gamma - vibration energy is about 0.8 mev in the actinides ; its energy at the barrier deformations is unknown , and this is one of the quantities that is varied in the modeling process discussed below . in particular ,",
    "if the nucleus is stable but soft to gamma deformation then the gamma vibration energy would be expected to be much lower than 0.8 mev .",
    "another possibility is that the nucleus at the barrier is stable for a certain degree of non - axial symmetry , in which case extra bands for rotation about the major deformation axis occur .",
    "these possibilities have to be considered especially for the inner barrier .",
    "odd - parity octupole vibrations have a special role among the transition states ; they provide the principal means for odd - parity states of the compound nucleus to decay through fission .",
    "nuclear spectroscopy provides evidence for two of these . at the lower energy , generally about 0.5 to 0.8 mev in the actinides ,",
    "is the @xmath57 vibration , the `` mass asymmetry '' vibration with rotational band members @xmath58 etc .",
    "it is assumed to lie at about the same energy at the inner barrier , but probably much lower at the outer barrier where the saddle - point has a mass - asymmetric shape @xcite , and the vibration is a low frequency reflection of the nuclear shape through the potential hill at zero octupole deformation .",
    "the higher energy vibration , often known as the `` bending '' vibration , has @xmath59 with rotational band members @xmath60 etc . , and is usually found above 0.9 mev at normal deformation . in most of our detailed modeling , the mass asymmetry vibration is assumed to be at 0.7 mev at the inner barrier , 0.1 mev at the outer barrier , while the bending vibration is taken to be 0.8 mev and 0.6 mev , respectively .",
    "the collective states described above are those expected in the energy gap before the appearance of the quasi - particle excitations that result from breaking the pairing energy .",
    "the energy gap is well - known in the spectra at normal deformation , and is a little greater than 1 mev in the actinides . above this energy",
    "the levels are normally described by a statistical level density function .",
    "the simplest form that is used is an exponential with constant temperature : @xmath61 exp[(e - v_{a , b})/\\theta]\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the density of transition states with zero angular momentum and single parity at excitation energy @xmath63 and total angular momentum @xmath64 , @xmath65 is a spin dispersion constant and @xmath66 is the temperature parameter .",
    "the subscripts @xmath67 label inner and outer barrier , respectively . at excitation energies of several mev a fermi - gas ( independent particle ) form",
    "is more appropriate .",
    "for such a composite model cameron @xcite has given tables of parameters that fit level density data .",
    "for the actinides these parameters have been readjusted in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is found that the temperature parameter is about 0.5 mev .",
    "spin dispersion constants are in the range of approximately 5 to 6 .    for statistical representation of the transition states above the energy gap at the barrier deformations",
    ", theory suggests that the energy gaps are somewhat higher and the temperatures somewhat lower than those at stable deformation @xcite .",
    "the level density constants , ca , b , are also expected to be greater than at stable deformation by a factor dependent on the symmetry of the barrier shape@xcite .",
    "the fission cross section at excitation energies considerably below the barrier energy gaps is affected by these  continuum \" transition states because of their high density and the hill - wheeler tunneling effect .",
    "the level density parameters can be adjusted in calculating the neutron - induced fission cross section up to about 2 mev neutron energy .",
    "the @xmath0u@xmath68 and @xmath69u@xmath70 reactions can reach excitation energies in the compound nucleus well below the neutron separation energy ( @xmath71 mev for @xmath8u ) , and thus can explore the fission probability well below the fission barrier .",
    "these reactions give the most direct information on barrier heights .",
    "measurements of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 reactions have been made by back et al .",
    "both these reactions excite compound nucleus states with a wide range of total angular momenta .",
    "the results of calculations of the relative cross sections for spin and parity are given in these references , and these have been used in our fits to the data .",
    "the error of measurement assessed in the above references includes a @xmath72 systematic error in magnitude .",
    "therefore only the shape of the fission probability curve in the region of the barrier gives useful information . in this energy region only competition between fission and radiation has to be considered .",
    "the assumption of stiff axial symmetry at the inner barrier implies a high energy for the gamma phonon band transition states .",
    "we have assumed its value to be 0.8 mev , similar to the observed value at normal deformation . with this transition state model",
    ", it is found that the fission probability data on the @xmath46 reaction are quite well reproduced with inner and outer barrier parameters : + @xmath73 the energy variation of the @xmath47 data is also quite well - reproduced by these parameters although the magnitude above the barrier is not in agreement . in this respect",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 data seem inconsistent .",
    "using these barrier parameters and the model of individual transition states described above , the statistical level density parameters can be adjusted to obtain reasonable agreement between calculation and the measured fission cross section of @xmath0u up to about 1.2 mev .",
    "this is about the value of the energy gap in the target nucleus @xmath0u , and the individual levels up to this energy seem to be quite completely known , thus accounting almost fully for the expected inelastic scattering .",
    "adjusted parameters are for the barrier `` continuum '' states are : @xmath74 with an energy gap of 1.65 mev above the inner barrier and 1.03 mev above the outer barrier .    for neutron energies above 1.2 mev we also need to describe the states of the residual nucleus for inelastic scattering by means of a level density formula .",
    "if we retain the above parameters for the barrier state density , we obtain by least squares fitting @xmath75 this is a considerably lower density than recommended in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath76 mev . if we are to retain the parameters of ref.@xcite we must assume that the barrier densities change at 2.5 mev and 2.0 mev above the inner and outer barrier respectively .",
    "then the new barrier density parameters for this higher energy region are @xmath77    the ground state spin and parity of @xmath0u are @xmath78 . at low energies ( up to a few tens of kev )",
    "s - wave neutron absorption is predominant .",

    "transition states with these quantum numbers are fully open for both barriers at the neutron separation energy . at neutron energies of 50 kev p - wave neutron absorption",
    "has become comparable with s - wave absorption .",
    "the resulting compound nucleus states with @xmath80 ranging from @xmath81 to @xmath82 access transition states that are fully open over the inner barrier , the even spins are fully open over the outer barrier while the odd spins are about half - open there .",
    "the d - waves ( exciting @xmath80 ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 ) become significant , but not dominant at about 0.5 mev neutron energy .",
    "the corresponding transition states are essentially fully open . by contrast",
    "the 77ev isomer has spin @xmath85 .",
    "the s - wave compound nucleus states have @xmath86 , the latter carrying three quarters of the compound nucleus formation cross section .",
    "the @xmath87 transition state is open at the neutron separation energy for both barriers , but the more important @xmath88 state ( a bending plus mass asymmetry combination ) is about 0.3 mev higher at the inner barrier and perhaps about equal to the neutron separation energy at the outer barrier .",
    "for this reason the low energy fission cross section of the isomer is calculated to be considerably lower than that of the ground state .",
    "the p - wave neutron absorption excites compound nucleus states with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the lowest @xmath91 transition is not believed to exist within the energy gap ( which is at approximately 7 mev excitation for both barriers ) .",
    "fission of the @xmath91 compound states ( one twelfth of the compound nucleus formation cross- section ) is thus suppressed at low neutron energies .",
    "the fission cross section calculated for the ground state from this barrier model , which we call model 1 , is shown in figure 1 , where the experimental data @xcite are also plotted .",

    "the cross section is higher than that of @xmath0u because of the considerably lower outer barrier .",
    "we have derived double - humped fission barrier parameters and transition state spectra of the compound nucleus @xmath8u that are consistent with known physics of the fission process and agree with data on fission probability extending into the sub - barrier energy region and with the neutron fission cross section of the ground state of @xmath0u . with these fission barrier properties",
    "we have calculated the fission cross section of the 77ev isomer of @xmath0u .",
    "the key transition state in this calculation is the @xmath123 state .",
    "both theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that this is at a high energy , especially at the inner barrier .",
    "this is the most important transition state for s - wave neutron induced fission , and therefore causes a considerable lowering of the low energy part of the cross section relative to the ground state cross section ( @xmath124 in the models studied ) .",
    "the isomer cross section does not reach near - equality with the ground state cross section until the neutron energy is well above 0.5 mev .",
    "the two cross sections then remain nearly equal until at least 2 mev .",
    "the predicted ratio of the neutron capture cross section to the fission cross section for the isomer is particularly striking . for model 3 , for example",
    ", this ratio is predicted to be a factor of about 3.4 ( 2.5 ) times larger than for the @xmath0u ground state at 1 kev ( 10 kev ) .",
    "figure 8 shows these predicted ratios , and the isomer capture to fission ratio remains larger up to neutron energy of about 0.5 mev as discussed earlier and shown in tables i and ii , the isomer is strongly populated by inelastic neutron scattering on the @xmath0u ground state .",
    "thus , neutron reaction network calculations involving the uranium isotopes in a high neutron fluence are likely to be affected by the 77 ev isomer of @xmath0u .    with one of these models ( model 4 ) , which is intermediate in properties amongst the set studied , the calculations of the fission cross sections are in good agreement with the measured cross sections for @xmath3u , @xmath4u and @xmath5pu .",
    "some minor adjustments in barrier heights have to be made for the two uranium isotopes ( to agree with the sub - barrier fission probability data ) .",
    "the agreement for @xmath4u is most significant , because this has , like the @xmath0u isomer , spin and parity @xmath125 . for the @xmath5pu case",
    "the outer barrier has to be reduced by about 0.5 mev to obtain agreement with the sub - barrier data , but with this change and the same transition state model all the major differences between the fission cross sections of @xmath0u and @xmath5pu can be explained .    .",
    "calculated cross sections for inelastic scattering from the ground state leading to population of the isomer and the ground state ( the ground state cross section includes the compound elastic scattering ) .",
    "the assumption is made that all states below 2 mev in @xmath0u have good k - numbers . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     99 v.i.mostovoi and g.i.ustroiev , atomnaya energiya * 57 * , 241 ( 1984 ) w.hauser and h.feshbach , phys.rev . *",
