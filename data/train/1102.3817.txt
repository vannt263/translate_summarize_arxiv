    "[ sec : summ ] , we summarize our findings .",
    "in this section , through analytical calculations , we show that when a 1d periodic scalar potential is applied to graphene : ( i ) the group velocity of the massless dirac fermions is anisotropically renormalized in momentum space in an unexpected fashion , and ( ii ) new massless dirac fermions are generated at the supercell brillouin zone boundaries  @xcite .",
    "we consider a situation where the spatial variation of the external periodic potential is much slower than the inter - carbon distance so that inter - valley scattering between the * k * and * k*@xmath8 points in the brillouin zone may be neglected  @xcite .",
    "we shall further limit our discussion to the low - energy electronic states of graphene which have wavevector @xmath9 close to the * k * point , i.e. with @xmath10 .",
    "there are two carbon atoms per unit cell in graphene , forming two different sublattices .",
    "hence the eigenstate of charge carriers in graphene can be represented by a two component basis vector . the hamiltonian of the low - energy quasiparticles in pristine graphene in a pseudospin basis , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 symbolically represent bloch sums of @xmath15-orbitals with wavevector * k * on the sublattices a and b , respectively , is given by  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the band velocity and the @xmath18 s are the pauli matrices .",
    "the eigenstates and the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , where @xmath21 is the band index and @xmath22 is the angle between * k * and the @xmath23 direction .",
    "we now assume that a 1d scalar potential @xmath24 , periodic along the @xmath25 direction with periodicity @xmath0 , is applied to graphene [ fig .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath26 then reads @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 identity matrix .",
    "next we perform a similarity transform , @xmath30 , using the unitary matrix @xmath31 where @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 here , without losing generality , we shall assume that an appropriate constant has been subtracted from @xmath24 and that @xmath24 has been shifted along the _ x _ direction so that the averages of both @xmath24 and @xmath32 are zero .",

    "we should note that in general @xmath46 which can directly be deduced from eq .",

    "( [ eq : e_alpha ] ) and change @xmath25 to @xmath47 , it is evident that @xmath45 $ ] s are real .",

    "( [ eq : basis ] ) can be written as @xmath51 after performing yet another similarity transform @xmath52 with @xmath53 we obtain the final result : @xmath54 the energy eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 equation  ( [ eq : e_p ] ) holds in general and not only for cases where the potential @xmath24 is even  @xcite .",
    "the only difference of the energy spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) from that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_p ] ) , other than a constant energy term , is that the group velocity of quasiparticles moving along the @xmath57 direction has been changed from @xmath17 to @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the electronic states near @xmath59 are also those of massless dirac fermions but having a group velocity varying _ anisotropically _ depending on the propagation direction .",
    "the group velocity along the _ x _ direction is unchanged independent of the potential . moreover , the group velocity along the @xmath57 direction is _ always lower _ than @xmath17 [ eq .  ( [ eq : f ] ) ] regardless of the form or magnitude of the periodic potential  @xmath24 as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "we have thus shown that other than the original dirac points , new massless dirac fermions are generated around the supercell brillouin zone boundaries , i.e. , the case with non - zero _ m _ values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_p ] ) .",
    "it has also been shown that these newly generated massless dirac points are the only available states in a certain energy window if graphene is subjected to a 2d repulsive periodic scalar potential having triangular symmetry  @xcite .",
    "one more thing to note is that in graphene under an external periodic scalar potential , a generalized pseudospin vector can be defined and used to describe the scattering properties between eigenstates ; and especially , back - scattering processes by a slowly varying impurity potential are suppressed as in pristine graphene  @xcite .",
    "now we move on to the case where a 1d vector potential @xmath3 is applied to graphene [ fig .",
    "we show through a novel transformation relation between scalar and vector potentials  @xcite that , unlike the electrostatic case , the group velocity of charge carriers in graphene under a 1d periodic vector potential is renormalized _",
    "isotropically_.    the superlattice hamiltonian , following the peierls substitution , is given by @xmath60 where _ e _ is the charge of an electron ( @xmath61 ) and _ c _ is the speed of light .",
    "the time - dependent dirac equation then reads @xmath62 writing the wavefunction as @xmath63 , the dirac equation becomes @xmath64 now , if we multiply eq .",
    "( [ eq : dirac2 ] ) by @xmath65 on both sides , define @xmath66 with @xmath67 and use the relations @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , eq .  ( [ eq : dirac2 ] ) becomes @xmath71 here , we have defined @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 equation  ( [ eq : dirac3 ] ) is thus equivalent to the dirac equation with a periodic scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) except that now the variables are imaginary numbers . using analytic continuation  @xcite",
    ", we obtain the energy - momentum dispersion relation in magnetic graphene superlattices from that in electrostatic graphene superlattices . for the states near the original dirac point , as shown in the previous section , the energy dispersion in graphene under a periodic scalar potential is given [ from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_p ] ) ] by @xmath75 where , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_alpha ] ) , @xmath76 plugging eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eprime ] ) , ( [ eq : kyprime ] ) , and  ( [ eq : vprime ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_p_m0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e_mgs ] ) , we find that the group velocity in graphene under an external periodic vector potential ( corresponding to a perpendicular magnetic field ) is renormalized _ isotropically _ in the @xmath79 space  @xcite even though the external vector potential profile is highly anisotropic in the _ x - y _ plane [ fig .",
    "note from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fprime ] ) that @xmath80 regardless of the form of the vector potential @xmath4 , i.e. , the group velocity in graphene under an external periodic vector potential is always reduced .",
    "this result can in fact be used as a special case to understand the predictions of velocity reduction in metallic carbon nanotubes and gap reduction in semiconducting carbon nanotubes under a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "if one wants to find the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of graphene under an external periodic potential with wavevector * k * not very close to the supercell brillouin zone boundary centers ( @xmath49 ) , one has to resort to numerical calculations .",
    "such numerical calculations have led us to the discovery of solutions corresponding to new branches of massless dirac fermions  @xcite that are not found in the analytical calculations discussed in the previous sections .",
    "the scattering amplitudes arising from the periodic scalar and vector potentials between eigenstates of pristine graphene [ eq .  ( [ eq : solh0 ] ) ] , using the hamiltonians in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) and in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_a ] ) , are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "here , @xmath83 is a superlattice reciprocal lattice vector and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the corresponding fourier components of the external periodic scalar and vector potentials , respectively .",
    "therefore , the energy dispersion and eigenstates of the quasiparticles in a graphene superlattice are obtained non - perturbatively within the single - particle picture by solving the following set of linear equations @xmath86 for graphene under an external periodic scalar potential , and by solving the following set of linear equations @xmath87 for graphene under an external periodic vector potential , where @xmath88 is the superlattice energy eigenvalue and we have used eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) , ( [ eq : scatter_v ] ) , and  ( [ eq : scatter_a ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath89 and @xmath90 indicate the mixing among different unperturbed quasiparticle states of pristine graphene .",
    "note that the scattering amplitude methods presented here are applicable to 2d graphene superlattices in general and not just to 1d periodic systems .",
    "if the external periodic scalar potential applied to graphene is sufficiently strong , new branches of massless dirac fermions are generated near the original dirac cone ( i.e. , zero - energy modes )  @xcite .",
    "note that these new zero - energy modes are different from the new massless dirac fermions discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalar ] , which have higher energies and are generated at the supercell brillouin zone boundary centers ( @xmath59 ) no matter how weak the perturbing potential is .",
    "as shown in fig .  2 , the number of zero - energy dirac modes increases with the amplitude of the external periodic scalar potential .",
    "these new zero - energy modes could have distinguishable signatures in quantum hall  @xcite or transport measurement  @xcite .",
    "the new zero - energy modes are generated when the applied periodic scalar potential @xmath24 has both even and odd symmetries [ fig .  2 or figs .",
    "3(a ) and  3(b ) ] .",
    "when the odd symmetry is broken [ fig .",
    "3(c ) ] , new massless dirac fermions are generated but the energy position could be different from zero [ fig .",
    "but , if the even symmetry is broken [ fig .  3(e ) ] , new massless dirac fermions are not generated [ fig .",
    "however , even in these broken - symmetry cases , the signatures of the modified electronic bandstructure could be captured in , e.g. , landau level measurements  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to focus on the conditions on the external periodic potential under which the number of zero - modes jumps , as shown by the steps in fig .",
    "2(b ) and fig .",
    "we call these systems at the jump special graphene superlattices ( sgss )  @xcite . in an sgs",
    ", the group velocity along the @xmath91 direction vanishes . figure  4 shows that the energy dispersion in an sgs is quasi-1d and the pseudospin in an sgs is either parallel or antiparallel to the @xmath23 ( or periodic ) direction  @xcite .",
    "because of this quasi-1d electron energy bandstructure in an sgs , the group velocity of electronic states are almost the same over a wide region in momentum space ; and this has led to the prediction that sgss can be used for electron beam supercollimation  @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of graphene under a general external periodic scalar potential is modified from that of graphene in several highly unexpected ways : ( i ) the group velocity is anisotropically renormalized in momentum space and ( ii ) new massless dirac fermions are generated at the supercell brillouin zone boundary . moreover ,",
    "when a strong 1d periodic scalar potential is applied , new zero - energy modes emerge . under certain conditions ,",
    "the group velocity of charge carriers along the direction perpendicular to the 1d periodic direction of the superlattice potential vanishes . in this special class of 1d graphene superlattices ,",
    "the electron energy bandstructure and pseudospin structure are quasi-1d and these properties can be used in collimating the electron flow . with a 1d external periodic vector potential applied to graphene ,",
    "on the other hand , the group velocity of charge carriers near the original dirac point is reduced isotropically .",
