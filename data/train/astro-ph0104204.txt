    "the broad band x - ray spectra ( 2 - 300 kev ) of seyfert 1 galaxies are generally well fitted by a cut - off power law continuum with superimposed secondary components like a neutral iron line and a reflection hump .",
    "the latter components have been detected in the end of the eighties with ginga ( piro et al .",
    "@xcite ; matsuoka et al .",
    "@xcite ; pounds et al .",
    "@xcite ) and are considered as signatures of reprocessing of the primary x - ray emission in surrounding cold matter . a high energy cut - off in the x - ray/@xmath0-ray part of the spectrum was first unambiguously detected by sigma and osse in ngc 4151 ( jourdain et al .",
    ", @xcite ; maisack et al .",
    "a high energy cut - off was also requested to fit the average x - ray/@xmath0-ray spectra ( obtained from data of different satellites ) of a sample of seyfert ( zdziarski et al .",
    "@xcite ; gondek et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the broad band capabilities of the italian - dutch satellite bepposax allowed to detect high energy cut - offs in other seyfert 1 galaxies , about half of the fifteen observed with this satellite",
    ". values of the high energy cut - offs range from 70 kev to @xmath1 300 kev ( matt @xcite , hereafter m00 ) . + a cut - off power law plus reflection model ( the so - called pexrav model in xspec , magdziarz & zdziarski @xcite ) depends on three parameters : the spectral index @xmath2 , the high energy cut - off @xmath3 and the reflection normalization @xmath4 , the formers characterizing the shape of the primary continuum .",
    "the physical interpretation of these parameters is generally done in the framework of thermal comptonization mechanism , which is commonly believed to be the origin of the x - ray emission of seyfert galaxies .",
    "using approximate relations ( cf .",
    "section [ result ] ) , it is then possible to derive , from values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , values of the temperature @xmath5 and optical depth @xmath6 of the `` comptonizing '' hot plasma ( the so - called corona ) .",
    "+ if such approximations are sufficient in isotropic geometries ( e.g. a central soft photon source surrounded by a spherical hot cloud ) , where comptonization process produces roughly power law spectra with a high energy cut - off , strong discrepancies may appear in anisotropic ones , especially for small optical depth and large temperature",
    ". indeed , the ( possible ) anisotropy of the source of seed photons ( as seen by the corona ) , may introduce anisotropies and modifications of the outgoing spectrum .",
    "the largest effect occurs when soft photons are emitted by a plane ( disk ) below the corona . in this case , photons backscattered towards the disk in the first scattering are necessarily produced in `` head  on collisions '' and therefore have an energy gain larger than average , while photons scattered towards the corona ( i.e. in the forward direction ) have an energy gain smaller than average . as a consequence , the contribution of the first scattering order to the outgoing flux is significantly reduced producing a spectral break ( the so - called anisotropy break ) in the spectrum . below the high energy cut  off the spectra is then better described by broken power laws than by a simple power law contrary to what is generally believed ( petrucci et al . , @xcite , hereafter p00 ) .",
    "these anisotropic effects become however less important for larger optical depth ( i.e. @xmath7 ) since they are `` smoothed '' by the larger number of compton scatterings suffered by the soft photons . + it is also worth noting that the energy of the anisotropy break which is , in practice , close to the peak energy of the third scattering order ( haardt @xcite ) , depends on @xmath5 but also on the temperature of the seed soft photon plasma @xmath8 . consequently , if in the case of isotropic geometry the spectral shape is relatively independent on @xmath8 , which fixes only the low energy boundary of the emitted spectrum , in anisotropic geometry the shape of the comptonization spectra depends on it . + in a recent paper ( p00 )",
    ", we have applied accurate comptonization models to fit high quality data of the _ beppo_sax  long look at ngc  5548 .",
    "we have underlined the importance of the anisotropic effects and , in particular , we have shown that due to the presence of the anisotropy break , above which the intrinsic continuum is steeper , the temperature of the hot electrons estimated from comptonization models in anisotropic geometry can be much larger that the one derived fitting the data with a power - law + cut off model .",
    "+ besides , we have shown that these different models may provide different ( and even opposite ) relationships between physical parameters .",
    "for instance , still in the case of ngc  5548 , the spectral softening of the spectrum , observed during a small flare in the central part of the observation , goes with an increase of the high energy cut  off ( i.e. of the corona temperature ) , in the case of pexrav , but with a decrease of the corona temperature when using an anisotropic comptonization model .",
    "+ in the same spirit of p00 , we extend our application of accurate comptonization models to a larger sample of objects .",
    "we report in this paper the results of this study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ data ]",
    "we briefly present the main results of the bepposax observations of seyfert galaxies .",
    "we also present the sample of objects we use for the purpose of this paper .",
    "we describe the models we used and the fitting procedure in section [ modfit ] .",
    "we also detail in this section the fit of the soft excess / warm absorber ( hereafter wa ) features observed in each object .",
    "we present the results of the fits in section [ result ] and discuss their physical interpretations in section [ discu ] .",
    "we then conclude in the last section .",
    "two major _ beppo_sax  core programs were devoted to classical seyfert 1 galaxies aiming to study the broad band spectra ( pi : g.c .",
    "perola ) and spectral variability ( pi : l. piro ) .",
    "thirteen sources have been observed on aggregate so far , since the launch of the satellite in 1996 .",
    "+ reviews summarizing the main results on these sources have been presented by piro et al . , ( @xcite ) and m00 .",
    "for all objects , the spectral models used by the authors included a power law with exponential cut ",
    "off ( i.e. @xmath9 ) characterized by a photon index @xmath2 and a e  folding energy @xmath10 , a gaussian to fit the neutral iron line near 6.4 kev and a compton reflection continuum characterized by a reflection normalization @xmath4 .",
    "soft excess and/or wa features were added if required by the data .",
    "+ the major findings are the followings :    * a high energy cut ",
    "off is generally observed , with an @xmath11-folding energy typically in the range 70300 kev . *",
    "all sources show the presence of a reflection component , so confirming the ginga and asca results ( nandra & pounds , @xcite ) .",
    "* only two objects ( mkn 509 and mkn 841 ) show the presence of a soft excess .",
    "this sharply contrasts with the results obtained with exosat ( turner & pounds @xcite ) or rosat ( walter & fink , @xcite ) where most of the seyfert 1 observed seemed to show such excess ( for a discussion of this point see piro et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , wa features ( mostly the o vii and o viii edges ) are generally observed in the lecs range . * a correlation between the power law index @xmath2 and the amount of reflection component @xmath4",
    "is indicated , in the same sense as found by zdziarski et al .",
    "( @xcite , hereafter z99 ) . however , the issue of the reality of this correlation is still open since it may be due to the fact that the two parameters are strongly related in the fitting procedure ( see for example vaughan & edelson @xcite ) .      from the sample of seyfert 1 galaxies observed by _ beppo_sax  , we have selected observations with good signal - to - noise ratios at high energies as measured with the pds instrument .",
    "we therefore favored objects with hard x - ray spectra .",
    "such observations are best suited for an analysis of the high energy spectra .",
    "the subsample of objects studied in this paper is reported in table [ tab1 ] , with the name of the different objects , the date of the _",
    "beppo_sax  observations ( some of these objects have been observed several times ) , the exposure time and the statistical significance in the pds instrument .",

    "however during the observation of july 96 , the source experienced a strong increase of the 2 - 10 kev flux by a factor two on time scales of one day , with significant spectral variability as shown by piro et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . according to these authors ,",
    "we choose to study separately the low and high state occuring during this period ( and indicated as 96l and 96h in the following ) .",
    "unfortunately , during the high state , the lecs was off .",
    "only the mecs and pds data are therefore available for this state .",
    "we have not used , in this paper , the observation of december 96 since it does not differ substantially from the low state of july 96 .",
    "+ concerning mkn 509 , its observation has been split in two parts during the ao2 . since no significant spectral variability",
    "was observed between the two data sets ( perola et al .",

    "@xcite ) covering the 210 kev range and the phoswich detector system , pds ( frontera et al .",

    ", we shall use only data in the range 0.14 kev .",
    "+ lecs and mecs event files and pds pha files were downloaded from the _ beppo_sax  sdc archives .",
    "the spectral counts were extracted from a circular region of 4 and 8 radius around the source centroid in the mecs and lecs images respectively .",
    "we used the data of the three ( or two , for observations done after may 1997 ) mecs units merged together to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . in xspec ( arnaud @xcite ) , we use the last updated responses ( sep . 1997 ) and background matrices of each instrument .",
    "we fit the data using two different models for the primary continuum : 1 ) an exponentially cut  off power law plus a reflection component from neutral material ( pexrav model of xspec , magdziarzk & zdziardski @xcite ) and 2 ) a thermal comptonization spectrum from a disk+corona configuration in slab geometry .",
    "the latter was obtained using the code of haardt ( @xcite , hereafter we will refer to this anisotropic comptonization code as ac2 ) .",
    "this code derived the angle  dependent spectra of the disk ",
    "corona system using an iterative scattering method , where the scattering anisotropy was taken into account only in the first scattering order .",
    "it includes also a reflection component described following white , lightman & zdziarski ( @xcite ) and lightman & white ( @xcite ) and assuming neutral matter .",
    "the spectral shape of the reflected photons is averaged over angles .",
    "it is multiplied by a first normalization factor which depends on the inclination angle ( see ghisellini , haardt & matt @xcite for details ) . in addition , the usual @xmath4 normalization is left free to vary in the fit procedure , so that , for the given inclination angle , @xmath12 corresponds to a solid angle , subtended by the reflector , of 2@xmath13 .",
    "we do not apply comptonization models for other geometries ( e.g. hemisphere ) since , as shown for ngc  5548 ( p00 ) , the results follow closely those obtained with the slab geometry .",
    "+ the fit parameters of ac2 are the temperature of the corona @xmath5 , its optical depth @xmath6 , the temperature of the disk @xmath8 ( assuming a black body soft emission ) and the reflection normalization @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pexrav continuum depends only on 3 parameters : the e  folding energy of the cut  off power law",
    "@xmath14 , the photon index @xmath2 and the reflection normalization @xmath4 .",
    "+      most of the objects present wa features and/or a soft excess in the low part ( i.e. in the lecs energy band ) of their spectra .",
    "good and realistic fits require to take these features into account .",
    "detailed analyses of these different components are however beyond the scope of this paper , which is instead focused on the high energy continuum of the sources .",
    "then , as a first approximation , we have added simple components ( edges , gaussian , blackbody ... ) to the primary continuum to reproduce the main features present in the soft part of the spectra .",
    "we discuss briefly the case of each source in the following .",
    "+      the _ beppo_sax  data of this galaxy have already been analyzed by piro et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) , assuming a simple cut  off power law for the primary underlying continuum . a prominent soft excess , known to exist in this object ( holt et al .",
    "@xcite ) below the @xmath12 kev cutoff due to a high absorbing column , is clearly detected in the observations of 1996 ( low state ) and 1999 .",
    "it is generally modeled by allowing some fraction of the central source to be completely uncovered or viewed through a lower column ( the so - called `` leaky absorber '' ) .",
    "in addition , there is evidence of a possibly separate soft excess component that does not vary with the 210 kev continuum ( pounds et al .",
    ", 1986 ; perola et al . ,",
    "part of this emission comes from an extended x  ray region known to exist in this object ( elvis et al .",

    "recent chandra observations with the high energy transmission grating spectrometer have revealed detail spectra of this source ( ogle et al . , @xcite ) and allow for the first time precise measurements of the ionization , temperature and kinetics of the extended soft x  ray emission region . + for the scope of the present paper , we model the complex soft x ",
    "ray emission in a ( relatively ) simpler manner .",
    "according to piro et al .",
    "( @xcite @xcite ) , we have used a dual absorber that is the source is covered completely by a medium with a column density @xmath15 and with a covering fraction @xmath16 by a second medium with a column density @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "the soft excess below 2 kev was modeled by a scattering component plus an ultrasoft component described by a thermal bremsstrahlung , both absorbed by the galactic column density . due to the lack of lecs data for the high state of 1996",
    ", we can not constrain the different components of the soft x - ray range .",
    "we thus analyze the data only above 3.5 kev adding a simple photo - electric absorption characterized by a column density @xmath15 .",

    "ngc 3783 was observed using the high energy transmission grating spectrometer on the chandra x - ray observatory ( kaspi et al.,@xcite ) .",
    "these authors detected a large number of emission and absorption lines , strongly confirming the presence of warm absorbing / emitting media embedding the central x - ray source .",

    ", the edge near 1.31.4 likely corresponds to contributions by fe l and ne k edges whereas the second one , centered near 0.80.9 kev , may be due to the o viii edge .",
    "+ concerning the line , we have checked that its addition significantly improves the fit with @xmath18=16 ( according to the f - test , this difference implies a probability less than 0.01 that the line is due to random fluctuations in the counts ) .",

    "the corresponding best fit central energy of the line was @xmath190.55 kev with an ew of @xmath1100 ev .",
    "such ew is large , and it is unlikely that this emission features was only produced by o vii emission lines .",
    "in fact , in the more extreme case where we see the blends of the three o vii lines , we expect an ew of only 30 ev ( de rosa , private communication )",
    ". the large ew and small energy of the line we obtained can be due in part to a bad modeling of the continuum near this component .",

    "the observation was split in two parts during the ao2 , the first one being done in may 1998 and the second one in october 1998 .",

    "a possible explanation is that , in the observation of 1996 , the presence of a larger reflection component ( also found with the pexrav fits ) may hide the anisotropy break , thus diminishing the constraints on @xmath8 , and allowing larger values .",
    "a purely statistical comparison between the two models is not possible since both give acceptable values of @xmath55 .",
    "the slab model has one more parameter and gives generally lower values of @xmath55 , except for ngc  4151 .",
    "however , we have checked , for this source , that the best fit @xmath55 probability are similar for the two models . besides , the two best fits have residuals without significant features and differences between each other .",
    "the two models give thus an equivalent representation of the data .",
    "for all objects , the estimated corona temperatures ( respectively optical depths ) from pexrav are substantially smaller ( respectively larger ) than those inferred with an anisotropic comptonization model .",
    "this trend is similar to the the result obtained for ngc 5548 by p00 . in fig .",
    "[ slabvspex]a we have plotted the corona temperatures obtained with ac2 versus the temperatures obtained with pexrav .",
    "large differences ( up to a factor 8) are found between the two estimates .",
    "note however that for ic 4329a , for which the high energy data are comparatively better than for the rest of the sample , the two models give results which are quite close to each other .",
    "+ the reason of these differences is relatively simple .",
    "within pexrav type models , the slope of the power law , determined with small errors by the lecs and mecs data , can not change , by hypothesis , at higher energies . a cut  off around 100 kev is then required to fit the pds data . in comptonization models ,",
    "the lecs and mecs data determine the slope below the anisotropy break . above this",
    "break the intrinsic spectrum is steeper and thus can fit the pds data without an additional steepening beyond 100 kev , allowing for a larger temperature and ( consequently ) a smaller optical depth to keep , roughly , the same power law slope .",
    "+      the reflection normalizations obtained with ac2 cluster around 1 , except for two extreme states of ngc 4151 .",
    "they are , in all cases but one ( es0 141-g55 ) , larger than those found using the simple cut  off power - law model .",
    "we have reported in fig .",
    "[ slabvspex]b the amplitude of the reflection component derived from both models . in some cases",
    "we obtain differences of factors 45 .",
    "note that with the exception of ngc  4151 for all other sources the slab model yields values of @xmath4 consistent with 1 .",
    "+ the case of ngc 4151 is peculiar , showing a large variation in @xmath4 between the 96 and 99 observations and an indication of a variation of @xmath4 also between the low and high states of the july 96 observation .",
    "these changes are present irrespective of the model used in the spectral fitting ( see also piro et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however the slab model yields higher absolute values , allowing for some reflection also in the 99 observation for which pexrav yields @xmath56 .",
    "according to the slab model , the corona temperature is very high in the 99 observation , which may offer a physical connection with the low value of @xmath4 as dicussed in section [ corrsess ] .",
    "+ we can also remark that the relatively small reflection component and the hardness of the spectrum of this object may be difficult to reconcile with simple corona geometries ( like a plane or a patchy corona for example ) .",
    "more complex ones ( as dynamics coronae for example , malzac et al .",
    "@xcite ) may be needed .",
    "another possibility may be that the reflecting material in ngc 4151 is highly ionized . in this case , fitting with models which do not take into account the complex ionization pattern of the reflector can severely underestimate the reflection normalization ( ballantyne , ross & fabian @xcite ; done & nayakshin @xcite ; . + as an illustration of these results , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ specpexh94]a and [ specpexh94]b the unfolded best fit spectra of ic4329a and ngc 4151 ( observation of 1999 ) obtained with pexrav ( dashed lines ) and ac2 ( solid lines ) .",
    "we have also plotted in each case the reflection hump component to better estimate its contribution to the total spectrum . in the case of ic 4329a ,",
    "the two models give roughly the same result at high energy . for ngc 4151",
    "however , large differences are expected between pexrav and ac2 , with a factor of 23 at 300 kev and larger than 10 above 500 kev .",
    "a comptonizing corona above a passive optically thick layer ( approximating an accretion disk with negligible internal heating ) is a complex system , in which the soft seed photons for the comptonization process are produced by reprocessing of the comptonized emission in the underlying passive layer .",
    "such a corona is `` self - cooled '' and , for a given geometrical configuration of the system , can only be in equilibrium if the temperature and optical depth satisfy a definite relation ( haardt & maraschi @xcite ) .",
    "these relations which essentially correspond to roughly constant compton parameters @xmath57 \\tau ( 1+\\tau)$ ] , with @xmath58 0.5 and 2 for the slab and hemisphere respectively , have been accurately computed by stern et al .",
    "( @xcite ; see also for a review svensson @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figktetau]a and [ figktetau]b the values of @xmath6 vs. @xmath5 , obtained for the 6 sources considered here using the spectral models ac2 and pexrav , are compared with the theoretical relations expected for a comptonizing region in energy balance for a plane ( filled rectangles , solid line ) and hemispherical ( filled hemispheres , dashed line ) configuration respectively .",
    "the best fit results obtained with ac2 ( fig . [ figktetau]a ) are relatively close to the theoretical expectations for the slab case even if they tend to fall preferentially above the solid line .",
    "the data therefore indicate a comptonization parameter larger than for a pure slab geometry , that is a more `` photon - starved '' configuration .",
    "a similar result was already derived by p00 for ngc 5548 . for the latter source ,",
    "best fits with a hemispherical comptonisation model were also perfomed .",
    "the derived coronal parameters were in fact in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for the hemisphere .",
    "however an implausibly large value of the reflection component ( of the order of 2 ) was required , suggesting that the real configuration is more complex than these two ideal cases . for the present sample we did not perform",
    "fits with hemispherical models .",
    "+ the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 obtained with pexrav ( cf . fig .",

    "they also fall above the theoretical expectation for a slab and even above the theoretical expectation for a hemisphere ( the theoretical curves of stern et al .",
    "@xcite have been extended to large @xmath6 assuming a constant value of the compton parameter for each curve i.e. y @xmath590.5 and 2 for the slab and hemispherical configuration respectively ) .",
    "therefore this set of parameters suggests , for each source of our sample , a configuration more `` photon - starved '' than a hemisphere .",
    "+ an important difference with respect to the slab model is that the optical depths derived from pexrav fits are generally larger than 1 .",
    "the corona should then be optically thick reducing or cancelling the effects of anisotropy .",
    "therefore also the pexrav model has an internal consistency .",
    "however a corona with large optical depth may wash out discrete features from the underlying disk ( e.g. lines and reflection itself , petrucci et al .",
    "@xcite ) more than would be desirable .",
    "this problem could be alleviated if the corona was `` patchy '' ( and possibly dynamic cf .",

    ", the validity of this correlation is under debate since @xmath4 and @xmath2 are strongly correlated in the fitting procedure ( vaughan & edelson @xcite ) .",

    "however our sample is biased in favor of objects with hard spectra , to ensure a good detection in the pds instrument . when the 13 objects actually observed by bepposax are taken into account a stronger correlation",
    "is observed ( m00 ) , in agreement with z99 .",
    "+ in the case of the ac2 model we have no simple way of characterizing the spectral shape .",
    "also results are available for only 6 sources and we can not include the other seyfert 1s observed by bepposax .",
    "therefore a direct comparison with the z99 correlation is not possible .",
    "below , however , we examine the correlation of @xmath4 with the corona temperature which can be computed for the two models .",
    "z99 interpret the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath2 in the framework of thermal reprocessing models where @xmath4 is directly proportional to the solid angle subtended by the cold matter surrounding the corona .",
    "the latter solid angle is not necessarily proportional to the soft photon flux reentering the corona , but it is likely that the larger is @xmath4 , the larger is the ratio of soft luminosity to hard luminosity in the corona , i.e. the smaller is the comptonization parameter @xmath61 , resulting in softer spectra ( larger @xmath2 ) . + it is interesting that the bepposax data can provide the temperatures associated with sources with different values of @xmath4 or @xmath2 , which were not available from the ginga data used by z99 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ rvsec ] where we plot @xmath4 vs. the corona temperature @xmath62 obtained with pexrav . here",
    "again , in order to have a larger sample , we added the best fit values obtained by m00 for the other seyfert 1s observed with bepposax .",
    "this plot suggests a _ positive _ correlation between the two parameters , that is , the temperature of the corona is _",
    "larger _ for _ larger _ values of the reflection normalization .",
    "in fact a plot of @xmath63 vs. @xmath2 shows that steeper spectra correspond to higher temperatures and ( as a corollary ) to lower optical depths ( cf .",
    "[ gammavste]a and [ gammavste]b ) .",
    "+ the slab model analysis yields different trends .",
    "a plot of @xmath4 vs. @xmath5 for the latter model shows that sources with _ larger _",
    "@xmath4 tend to have _ lower _ @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "[ rvskte ] ) , a behaviour opposite to what is found with pexrav .",
    "the suggested correlation depends however strongly on the different states of ngc  4151 .",
    "+ to summarize , an analysis in terms of pexrav indicates the following correlations : _ larger _ reflection component ( steeper @xmath2 )  _ larger _ temperature ( cf . fig .",
    "[ rvsec ] ) while the analysis in terms of anisotropic comptonization yields : _ larger _ reflection  _ lower _ temperature ( cf .",
    "[ rvskte ] ) .",
    "+ the latter behaviour is naturally expected in pair free compton cooled coronae ( see fig [ figktetau]a ) since the transition to lower compton parameter ( i.e. higher @xmath64/@xmath65 as suggested by a larger @xmath4 ) implies a decrease in the temperature for constant optical depth , as ( relatively well ) verified by our sources .",
    "+ the behaviour indicated by pexrav could instead be understood better in the case of a pair dominated corona in pair equilibrium .",
    "in such a case , for constant hard compactness , the larger the ratio @xmath66 , the larger the temperature of the corona .",
    "this behavior is simply imposed by the pair equilibrium .",
    "indeed , an increase of the cooling corresponds to a decrease of the number of particles in the hard tail of the thermal particle distribution . to reach a new equilibrium",
    "the temperature must increase .",
    "( zdziarski @xcite ; svensson @xcite ; ghisellini & haardt @xcite ; coppi @xcite ) .",
    "+ a possible limitation of the `` pair dominated '' interpretation comes from the high values of the compactness @xmath65 required by the physical parameters determined with pexrav .",
    "we have reported on fig .",
    "[ figktetau2 ] the @xmath6@xmath67 relations expected , for a pair dominated corona , for different values of @xmath65 , but varying the ratio @xmath68 .",
    "we have also included the observations of m00 .",
    "the data require values of @xmath65 in the range 1001000 .",
    "given the ( unabsorbed ) luminosity of the sources of our sample ( @xmath69 of the order of @xmath70 erg.@xmath24.s@xmath25 ) , this implies black hole mass upper limits of the order of @xmath71 solar masses ( for @xmath65=100 ) .",
    "this is relatively smaller than ( but roughly consistent with ) black hole mass estimations obtained from reverberation mapping or resolved kinematics methods for most of the objects of our sample ( see gebhardt et al .",
    "@xcite and nelson @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the worse case is that of ngc  4151 , where the pexrav best fit values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 require very large hard compactness ( larger than 1000 ) , implying a black hole mass of @xmath72 m@xmath73 ( reverberation mapping methods estimate a black hole mass of @xmath74 , clavel et al .",
    "@xcite ; ulrich & horne @xcite ) . in this case , however , the complexity of the soft part of the spectrum may lead to an uncorrect modelisation of the continuum .",
    "we therefore conclude that the pair dominated coronae interpretation is also still valid for this object .",
    "other observations ( with better constraints on the compactness and the physical parameter of the corona ) are clearly needed to confirm or disprove these results .",
    "the aim of this paper was to test anisotropic comptonization models over the high signal to noise _",
    "beppo_sax  observations of a sample of six seyfert 1 ( seven observations ) .",
    "we use two types of model : a detailed comptonization code in slab geometry , which treats carefully the anisotropy effects in compton processes , and a simple cut  off power law plus reflection model ( pexrav model of xspec ) .",
    "the latter is generally used as a zero order approximation to comptonization spectra .",
    "if this is a relatively good approximation for isotropic geometry , it fails to reproduce the real shape of comptonization spectra in anisotropic ones ( like a plane , hemispherical or spherical hot region above a flat disk ) . in this case ,",
    "due to the deficiency of the first order scattering component towards the observer , it better resembles a broken power law with convex curvature .",
    "this leads to strong differences between the best fit parameter values obtained with these two models .",
    "the main results of this work are the following :    * the data are well fitted by both models and there is no statistical evidence for a model to be better than the other .",
    "both models give results in agreement with a x - ray source geometry more `` photon starved '' than the slab case . * our best fits with comptonization models in slab geometry",
    "give a temperature generally much larger and an optical depth much smaller than derived from the power law + cut  off fits , using standard comptonization formulae .",
    "the estimate of the reflection normalization is also larger with the slab corona model .",
    "* the two models also lead to different relationships between physical parameters .",
    "for instance , pexrav indicates a correlation between the reflection normalization and the corona temperature whereas the slab corona model suggests an anticorrelation .",
    "this has major consequences for the physical interpretation of the data .",
    "thus , the pexrav results suggest that the hot corona may be pair dominated whereas the slab corona model is in better agreement with a low pair density solution .",
    "these results should have observational consequences .",
    "first , the large differences in the fitted temperatures lead to widely different predictions as to the fluxes emitted at higher energies , above the pds range .",
    "this underlines the need of better soft @xmath0ray observations , as those possibly provided by integral , in order to directly confirm or disprove the temperatures inferred with anisotropic comptonization models .",
    "+ on the other hand , the large values of @xmath6 predicted by pexrav would spread out the reflection hump in the entire x - ray range , avoiding any detection of this component .",
    "the fact that we obtain not negligible values of @xmath4 with pexrav may however be reconciled with the large values of @xmath6 if the corona is `` patchy '' . indeed , in this case",
    ", reflection could come from the uncovered part of the cold , reflecting material .",
    "part of the reflection could also come from the torus .",
    "the variability of the reflection component may allow to differentiate these two possibilities .",
    "large values of @xmath6 would also modify the profile of the fe line component produced in the disk , leading to an attenuation and broadening of the line .",
