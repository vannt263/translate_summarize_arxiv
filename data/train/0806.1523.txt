    "undoubtedly one of the major discoveries of the _ cassini _ mission was the plume of water vapor and dust emanating from saturn s moon enceladus @xcite .",
    "in addition to opening up many lines of research as to the origin of the vents and their source of heat ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the discovery solved a hitherto outstanding mystery of the saturn system : since 1993 it has been known that there exists a large population of hydroxyl radicals in the inner magnetosphere @xcite , centered near the orbit of enceladus at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 cm ) and extending to @xmath3 . in order to populate and maintain the oh torus",
    ", it was estimated that @xmath4 molecules per second of water needed to be injected into the magnetosphere @xcite from a then unknown source .",
    "@xcite estimate that the release of water from enceladus is sufficient ( @xmath5 ) for the small moon to be the source of the observed oh torus .",
    "the `` tiger stripe '' regions from which the water plume emerges @xcite possess inferred temperatures as high as 180k @xcite .",
    "recently , a hotspot temperature of 180 k was measured , again by the cirs instrument ( nasa news release 2008 - 050 ) .",
    "the gravitational pull of enceladus ( escape velocity @xmath6 ) does little to slow the outflow of gas at this temperature .",
    "free expansion of water vapor at 180k from the surface of enceladus and subsequent intersection of the jet with previously emitted vapor will result initially in a narrow ( @xmath7 ) torus of vapor with characteristic temperature @xmath8k , i.e. velocity dispersion @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of the neutral water is limited by ionization and dissociation processes whose rates are listed in table [ tab : proc ] .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that radial spreading of the water torus can occur via one of these processes : charge exchange with corotating ions . in this paper",
    "we investigate a different spreading mechanism . from table [",
    "tab : proc ] it is clear that a neutral molecule does not `` feel '' the influence of the magnetospheric plasma or solar uv during a time @xmath10 s after production .",
    "we shall demonstrate that this is sufficient time for the neutral water molecules to interact with _",
    "each other _ many times , and for the torus to heat and spread to the extent of the observed oh torus .",
    "the dynamics of moon - generated tori have been considered by @xcite in the context of the atomic hydrogen tori of titan and triton . @xcite and",
    "@xcite investigated the viscous heating of the triton torus via monte carlo simulations .",
    "the enceladus torus is unique in consisting of nearly pure water vapor @xcite .",
    "the particular properties of water as a polar molecule make the enceladus water torus a fascinating physical and chemical system .",
    "comets are another astrophysical system in which almost pure water is observed , and much of the work on the spectrum and collisions of water vapor has been done in this context ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we shall make use of these results for the cometary case .",
    "global simulations of the water torus around saturn , including all species of neutrals and ions , have been carried out by @xcite and @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "no significant viscous heating was found .",
    "we discuss the reasons for this discrepancy in section [ sec : discuss ] .    in section [ sec : xs ] we calculate the cross section for collisions between water molecules , and estimate the collision rate in the water cloud .",
    "the nature of viscous evolution at low collision rates is discussed in section [ sec : stir ] , where we also investigate the impact of collisional inelasticity upon both spreading and heating rates .",
    "section [ sec : cooling ] is devoted to the evaluation of the inelasticity of neutral water collisions in the enceladus torus , and then in section [ sec : spread ] we find the degree of viscous evolution permitted before the neutrals are lost to charge exchange .",
    "the steady - state column density profile of the heated torus is estimated in section [ sec : sstate ] . in section [ sec : discuss ] we discuss the consequences of the neutral - neutral interaction and make comparisons with previous studies .",

    ".rates of external ( non neutral - neutral ) processes .",
    "charge exchange and electron impact ionization rates are applicable at radial location of enceladus ( @xmath1 ) , assuming ions and neutrals occupy the same volume .",
    "notes : ( a ) from @xcite ; ( b ) from @xcite [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : rot ]    the population of rotational levels is far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "comparing the spontaneous emission coefficients from table [ tab : rot ] to the collision time estimated in eq .",
    "[ eq : tcoll ] reveals @xmath11 ( this remains true for spontaneous emission from higher rotational levels ) .",
    "thus any rotational modes excited by a collision will have decayed radiatively to the ground state before the next collision .",
    "energy that goes into molecular rotation is effectively lost to the system and constitutes cooling .",
    "further , when considering collisional excitation we need only include transitions from the ground states .",
    "internal modes may be excited by other processes , such as solar radiation or microwave background pumping , or collisions with electrons ( we neglect collisions with ions here because we consider these to be a loss mechanism for the neutral water ) . solar pumping results in an excitation rate @xmath12 ( from values for comets , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , still well below the spontaneous emission rate .",
    "the microwave background produces an excitation rate @xmath13 .",
    "the maximum density of electrons in the magnetosphere is @xmath14 @xcite . for any reasonable interaction speed and cross section , the rate of electron impacts is much less than @xmath15 .",
    "we conclude therefore that the water molecules are essentially always to be found in their ground state , and that rotational energy can not be converted into translational ; rather it can only flow in the other direction , via collisions .",
    "the typical kinetic energy of a molecule in the cold torus at 180k is @xmath16 ev , not much larger than the energy spacing between the lowest rotational levels . at these lowest temperatures",
    ", we can not neglect quantum mechanical effects .",
    "the permanent dipole moment of the water molecule makes possible long range interactions that involve transitions between internal modes .",
    "in particular , the dipole - dipole interaction potential leads to the same selection rules as for dipole allowed radiative transitions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in the case of rotational transitions",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath17 ( the parity of the wavefunction must change , but the total spin must not ) .",
    "resonant exchange of a quantum of rotational energy is the most common type of interaction @xcite ; since in our case molecules are in the ground state when they collide , these do not concern us .",
    "exact quantum mechanical calculations for the rate of translational to rotational energy are unavailable .",
    "instead we make a `` worst case scenario '' estimate of the maximum amount of energy lost per collision , if in every collision a rotation were excited . at 180k ,",
    "the maximum energy loss per collision that still permits viscous heating is 0.006 ev ( 3/11 of the thermal energy ) .",
    "the ratio of ortho to para water is not known a priori .",
    "for some comets ( temperature @xmath18 k ) it has been measured at @xmath19 @xcite : we adopt this value .",
    "the average energy loss to rotation per collision could then be at most @xmath20 ev , i.e. heating would still occur .",
    "in fact , @xcite estimate that only once in every 4 collisions does transfer between translational and rotational energy occur , making the the average energy lost per collision of order 0.001 ev .      from a classical point of view ,",
    "the water molecule consists of frictionless atoms of oxygen and hydrogen ( two ) . only individual atoms within molecules",
    "are considered to collide during a collision , and they do so instantaneously .",
    "this view is appropriate when the thermal energy is much larger than the energy splitting between states . in order to spin up the water molecule ,",
    "an impactor must collide with one of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the impactor is an atom within another water molecule , with velocity @xmath21 relative to the molecule to be hit .",
    "the colliding particle in the impactor is most likely to be the ( larger ) oxygen atom . after collision the velocity of the hit hydrogen atom is @xmath22",
    "if the collider were a hydrogen , @xmath23 would be halved . the rotation frequency of the impacted molecule",
    "about the massive oxygen atom is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the bond length .",
    "the amount of energy in rotation is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the moment of inertia of the water molecule .",
    "the ratio of rotational energy to incoming translational energy is given by @xmath28 using the mean moment of inertia @xmath29 and the bond length @xmath30 @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath32 for the fraction of energy transferred into molecular rotation after a single collision . the fractional energy loss to rotation @xmath33",
    "is thus substantially less than the limiting value for heating derived in section [ sec : stir ] , @xmath34 .",
    "heating can occur .",
    "we adopt the fractional inelasticity parameter derived here @xmath33 for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we have established so far that the collision rate in the cold torus is conducive to rapid heating , and that rotational line cooling is not sufficient to prevent this heating .",
    "as the torus heats and viscously spreads , the density will fall and the collision cross section will change . to improve upon our simple estimates",
    "we take these factors into account and make a simple model for the time evolution of the water torus , assuming it begins unheated and lasts for the charge exchange time , i.e. the torus contains @xmath35 , where the source rate is believed to be @xmath36 .",
    "we again adopt axisymmetry and assume an initial temperature 180k ( i.e. @xmath37 ) .",
    "we solve the following simplified differential equations .",
    "the number density of water molecules in the torus centered around @xmath1 is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the full radial width of the torus , and @xmath40 is the full vertical width . viscous spreading occurs at speed @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the lengthscale over which the angular momentum varies .",
    "viewing the torus as two segments each of lengthscale @xmath43 , the radial spreading rate is approximated as @xmath44 where the viscosity @xmath45 is obtained from equation ( [ eq : visc ] ) with @xmath46 .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath47 evolves according to @xmath48 where the second term in brackets represents cooling due to expansion of the torus , approximating it as a gas with adiabatic index @xmath49 .",
    "we also employ @xmath50 for the full vertical width of the torus ( twice the scale height ) , where we used eq .",
    "[ eq : uz ] to obtain the vertical velocity dispersion .",
    "the collision rate is @xmath51 where @xmath52 comes from eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmat ] .",
    "[ eq : ur ] for the radial velocity dispersion , the torus has initial radial width @xmath53    figure [ fig : heat ] shows the result of this calculation .",
    "although the density and collision rate fall , the torus continues to heat . after the charge exchange time , the radial extent of the torus is @xmath54 and the vertical scale height is of order @xmath55 . because now @xmath56 the neglect of radial variations is no longer valid ; we address this in the next section .    .",
    "solid line : radial width of torus ; dashed line : vertical scale height.,width=288 ]    .,width=288 ]    we also investigate the effect of varying the initial temperature of the water in the torus . at lower temperatures , the torus is initially more dense , and the collision rate may be larger than the orbital frequency . in these cases",
    "we use the following relation for the viscosity @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the high density - regime viscosity from eq .",
    "[ eq : high_visc ] , and @xmath59 comes from the low - collision rate expression , eq .",
    "[ eq : visc ] . in the high density case ,",
    "the viscous heating rate is small and is set equal to @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig : temps ] displays the results of this calculation .",
    "when @xmath61 the width after one charge exchange time is similar to the case when @xmath62 . for smaller initial velocity dispersions ,",
    "the torus remains in the high collision - rate regime and never reaches the critical point @xmath63 where the viscosity is largest .",
    "the spreading is therefore much less .",
    "we now adopt the results of the previous section for initial temperature 180k , i.e. @xmath64 then calculate the expected steady - state radial distribution of water in the torus . in steady state",
    "the torus , surface mass density @xmath65 , evolves according to @xmath66\\right)-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\tau_{\\rm loss}(r ) } \\ , , \\label{eq : sstate}\\ ] ] where the first term on the right is the standard equation for radial viscous spreading in a thin keplerian disk @xcite and the second is the loss rate of neutrals to charge exchange and ionization . strictly speaking the above equation is valid only when @xmath67 , i.e. when local disk properties can be related to local values of transport coefficients .",
    "clearly we are close to the edge of validity of this approximation .",
    "in particular , it neglects the high - energy , high - eccentricity tail of the particle distribution , and as such we expect the amount of spreading calculated to be a lower limit .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : visc ] and [ eq : colltime ] , the viscosity is given by @xmath68 we convert to surface mass density by means of @xmath69 and for the collision cross section we use eq .",
    "[ eq : sigmat ] expressed in terms of velocity dispersion @xmath70 : @xmath71 augmenting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : vels])-([eq : sigmav ] ) with kepler s law @xmath72 and scaling all quantities to the orbit of enceladus , we obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "we then solve the differential equation ( [ eq : sstate ] ) numerically , setting the surface density equal to zero at the edge of the rings , i.e. the rings are considered perfect absorbers .",
    "we place the edge of the rings at an effective radius larger than their actual edge at @xmath75 : an eccentric orbit centered at distance @xmath76 reaches a minimum radius @xmath77 at periapse , and if the orbit anywhere intersects the rings the particle will be absorbed . because we have assigned an eccentricity @xmath78 to all particles , the edge of the rings is placed at @xmath79 .    as the torus spreads and heats",
    ", the neutral water molecules spend less time in the regions of high ion density , and so the lifetime to charge exchange increases .",
    "the rate of photodissociation to oh+h , however , is independent of radius and is similar to the charge exchange rate near enceladus ( see table [ tab : proc ] ) .",
    "we consider two cases .",
    "first , we keep @xmath80 constant with radius and equal to the photodissociation time .",
    "this corresponds to treating dissociation as a loss mechanism .",
    "second is the more physically realistic case , in which we retain the oh and treat it in the same way as water : oh has a similar dipole moment ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mass to water , so its neutral interactions are similar .",
    "we neglect any energy gained by the oh upon dissociation , since we expect most of this to go to the liberated hydrogen atom . in this second case , we adopt the following formula for the loss timescale as a function of radius @xmath81   6 \\times 10 ^ 6 { \\rm ~s},\\ ] ] up to a maximum of @xmath82 s , corresponding to the photoionization timescale . this expression was obtained as an approximate fit to fig .",
    "17 of @xcite , who calculate the neutral loss timescale as a function of radius , including loss to charge exchange , electron impact ionization and solar photoionization .        the neutral column density for both cases is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldens ] .",
    "both profiles are in reasonable agreement with the observed oh column density from @xcite .",
    "the true oh column is bracketed by the two lines plotted .",
    "it must be noted that a direct comparison between these curves and the measured oh column is inappropriate for the following reasons : first , we have plotted water or water+oh , not oh alone ; and second , we have neglected spreading of the torus via the other established mechanism , charge exchange @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to compare the derived full width of the torus with the result of the calculation in section [ sec : spread ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : coldens ] , the full width between points with @xmath83 is @xmath84 , consistent with @xmath54 derived in section [ sec : spread ] .",
    "our results serve to show that significant spreading of the torus can occur via neutral - neutral interactions alone , and thus such interactions , with correct cross sections , should be in future included in the global models such as those of @xcite which include all relevant processes .    a further issue that can be addressed is deposition of water on to the outer parts of the rings .",
    "@xcite estimate using their model that 17% of the water from enceladus is precipitated on to the rings .",
    "@xcite report measurements of a decrease in plasma density at the edge of the rings , and use this to calculate the rate of absorption of ions . in both of the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coldens ] , about 70 kg  s@xmath85 ( 25% ) of the total 280 kg  s@xmath85 released by enceladus precipitates on to the rings .",
    "this is probably a lower limit , both because other processes also contribute to loss on to the rings ; and because our model probably represents a lower limit to the degree of spreading of the torus .",
    "the detailed models of @xcite do not show significant viscous heating or interactions between neutrals .",
    "we suggest that this is because their adopted water - water cross section was that of atomic oxygen @xcite , which has radius @xmath86  .",
    "in fact , the characteristic collisional size of the molecule is substantially larger , at least that of the o@xmath87 ion ( @xmath88  ) , and is further enhanced by the permanent dipole moment as detailed in the introduction . because there are fewer collisions between neutrals before they are impacted by other processes , they do not spread or heat significantly in the models of jurac et al .",
    "@xcite performed monte carlo simulations of the low - collision rate atomic hydrogen torus around neptune s moon triton .",
    "this approach follows individual particles and so does not suffer the potential inaccuracies of our thin disk model .",
    "the comparison between marconi s results and ours , however , is encouraging .",
    "after a similar number of collision times , the torus has spread by only a slightly larger amount than we find in our section [ sec : sstate ] .",
    "the low density of the extended water torus makes it difficult to observe in situ and remotely . only in the fluorescent emission of the hydroxyl radicals",
    "has the extended neutral torus been seen @xcite , while only very close to enceladus are the neutral densities large enough to be measured in situ @xcite .",
    "once ionized , detection is easier , but the additional electromagnetic forces felt by ions and electrons renders the inference of the distribution of their parent neutral population difficult , although this has been attempted @xcite .",
    "the majority of the extended neutral water cloud has never been directly detected .",
    "the upcoming _ herschel _ mission has the ability to change this .",
    "one of the science goals of the _ herschel space observatory _ , due for launch in 2008 , is the observation of water rotational lines in the nearby universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with unparalleled sensitivity and angular resolution .",
    "the hifi instrument on board herschel provides continuous frequency coverage from 480 to 1250 ghz , covering @xmath89 of the lower rotational transitions of the water molecule , at frequency resolutions up to @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "the 3.5 m diameter of herschel provides angular resolution at 560 ghz of @xmath91 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath92 at the distance of saturn .",
    "this resolution is sufficient to crudely map the neutral torus .",
    "we now estimate the signal strength from the torus . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the @xmath93 ( ortho ) transition at 560 ghz , and use our steady - state hot torus model from the previous section .",
    "we take the optimistic view that every collision leads to an excitation of this line ( but neglect emission due to electron collisional and solar excitation , which will be significant ) , and calculate the flux per beam of _ herschel _ as a function of distance along the equator , where saturn is assumed to be at equinox .",
    "the received flux is expressed in the standard way in terms of an antenna temperature @xmath94 : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the specific intensity of the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "emission in the 560 ghz line is spread by both thermal and orbital doppler shifts ; we adopt a linewidth characteristic of the local velocity dispersion , which is a fraction of the orbital velocity in our model , @xmath97 .",
    "the typical linewidth is then of order @xmath98 mhz , i.e. @xmath99 .    integrating along lines of sight through the equatorial plane of the torus , and neglecting beam dilution due to vertical variation in density , we obtain the antenna temperature profile shown in fig . [ fig : temps ] .",
    "with a system temperature @xmath100 k in the lowest band of the hifi instrument , herschel has a 5-sigma detection limit of 1.6 mk , in 1 hour of observation at frequency resolution @xmath101 @xcite , and this is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : herschel ] as the horizontal dotted line .      under the assumed conditions ,",
    "then , the neutral water torus is readily observable by _ herschel_. the angular resolution prevents the detailed examination of the spatial distribution , but by comparing the flux in various lines it should be possible to determine the collision rate in the torus and to gauge the temperature of the water via linewidths . a more comprehensive model of the torus",
    "should be used to make detailed predictions for different physical models .      in the above the torus",
    "was assumed optically thin in the 560 ghz line .",
    "in fact the optical depth is close to unity and a bright background source could allow observation of the torus to further distances from the planet , where less emission occurs .    the optical depth in the line is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the linewidth and @xmath104 is the line of sight column density in water molecules in the lower of the two rotational states ( the vast majority of molecules , as discussed in section [ sec : cooling ] ) .",
    "using the spontaneous emission coefficient from table [ tab : rot ] and the line of sight column density at 6 @xmath105 from our steady - state model in section [ sec : sstate ] , we obtain @xmath106 the torus is thus readily detectable in absorption against any sufficiently bright millimeter source that passes behind it",
    ". it small angular size , however , makes the existence of any such source rather unlikely ; the cosmic microwave background could be used , but because of its near isotropy on the sky , the strength of the signal would be reduced by a factor @xmath107 .",
    "it is clear from this work that neutral - neutral interactions in the enceladus torus can not be neglected ; they alone can account for the observed radial extent of the hydroxyl torus , though undoubtedly spreading also occurs through charge exchange reactions .",
    "the water - water collisions , with the cross sections calculated here , should be included in future global simulations of the torus .",
    "this may impact our estimates of ice deposition rates on the rings , as well as the required source rate to sustain the observed torus .",
