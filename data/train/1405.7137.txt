    "massive o - type stars evolve into wolf - rayet ( wr ) phases when their hydrogen fuel has been consumed and products of nuclear fusion appear in their atmosphere , before ending their lives as core - collapse supernovae @xcite . typically , the progenitors of wr stars have initial masses greater than 25 @xcite , and they spend @xmath510% of their @xmath5 5 myr lifetime in the wr phase @xcite .",
    "spectra of wr stars are predominantly characterized by emission lines of he and n ( wn stars ) , he and c ( wc stars ) and he and o ( wo stars ) . in the evolutionary sequence of massive stars , wc and",
    "wo stars are expected to correspond to later stages than wn stars .",
    "wr stars are known to produce strong stellar winds driven by their strong radiation field .",
    "the stellar winds can reach velocities up to 1000 - 3000 km s@xmath6 with mass - loss rates of @xmath7 yr@xmath6 , depending upon mass and age @xcite .",
    "these winds not only affect the evolution of wr stars but also have a tremendous impact on their ambient media . the detailed physical properties of wr stars are summarized in many past reviews @xcite .",
    "x - ray emissions from wr binaries may consist of the combined emission from intrinsic stellar wind shocks and colliding wind shocks between the two binary components @xcite .",
    "colliding wind binary systems often exhibit periodic x - ray modulation either because of the change in binary separation or due to the changing circumstellar opacity along the line of sight to the collision zone , resulting from the orientation of the system with respect to the observer .",
    "serious investigations of these variations were carried out after the advent of high - quality facilities like   and _ chandra_. many o+o and wr+o binaries as observed with , show different kinds of phase - locked modulations e.g. , v444 cyg and cd cru @xcite , hd 159176 @xcite , hd 152248 @xcite , hd 93403 @xcite , etc .",
    "it is believed that single wr and ob stars emit soft x - rays ( kt @xmath8 1 kev ) via shocks that are set up by instabilities in their supersonic line - driven winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that winds of wr stars can be driven by radiation pressure alone if multi - scattering effects are taken into account .",
    "wr 25 ( = hd 93162 ) is a bright ( v @xmath5 8.03 mag ) wr binary located in the carina nebula region .",
    "wr 25 is classified as wn6h + o4f @xcite . @xcite detected periodic radial velocity variations in wr 25 and suggested that wr 25 is an eccentric binary system with a probable period of about 208 days .",
    "the basic parameters of wr 25 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the origin of the large x - ray flux of wr 25 is suggestive of colliding wind emission in a binary system @xcite .",
    "the x - ray to bolometric luminosity ( ) ratio of @xmath9 @xcite for wr 25 is an order of magnitude higher than those observed for single massive stars .",
    "@xcite noticed that the x - ray luminosity of wr 25 had remained relatively constant over a time span of 10 yr .",
    "later , @xcite found an increase in x - ray luminosity of more than a factor of two and suggested that the observed x - ray variability is a result of colliding wind emission in a moderate eccentric binary . in this context",
    ", we use the full set of archival xmm - newton and swift x - ray observations of wr25 to further investigate the properties of the colliding winds in this system .",
    "our aim also extends to search for variability in the v - band using the all sky automated survey [ asas ; @xcite ] archival data .",
    "the paper is organized along the following lines : section [ sec : observation ] , describes the observations and data reduction .",
    "the light curve analysis is given in section [ sec : lightcurve ] , x - ray spectral properties of wr 25 are described in section [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "section [ sec : optical ] describes the v - band optical observations . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we present the discussion and conclusions .",
    "+ notes :  and  are in units of @xmath10 @xmath11 ,  is in units of @xmath12 @xmath13 , and ,  and   are unabsorbed x - ray luminosities in soft , hard and total bands in units of 10@xmath14 .",
    "abundances are in units of solar photospheric values .",
    "@xmath15 is @xmath16 per degree of freedom and dof is the degree of freedom .",
    "the ems corresponding to the cool and hot temperatures change substantially , reflecting the variations in x - ray luminosities in the soft and hard bands .",
    "the x - ray luminosities observed for wr 25 were found to be more than that for other close wr+o binaries and single wn stars @xcite .",
    "x - ray light curves of wr 25 as observed from   and   show similar behavior . however , in terms of phase coverage , the light curves from  are much better than those observed from . the deficit in x - ray flux just after periastron passage could be due to the eclipse of the wind interaction zone by the wind of the wn star . in all bands , the excess emission is strongest near periastron passage .",
    "the x - ray enhancement after the eclipse in the soft band indicates that besides the colliding wind , individual components of the wr 25 system also contribute to the x - ray emission .",
    "the soft x - ray flux peaked near phase 0.5 , which further supports that both of the components of wr 25 are sources of soft x - rays , enhancing the combined soft x - ray flux when both of the stars are completely visible to the observer . during phase @xmath17",
    ", the soft x - rays further decrease to the minimum value indicating the possibility of a secondary eclipse , when the o - star is in front of the primary wn star . the deeper primary eclipse at phase @xmath18 could be due to the larger opacity of the wn wind . on the other hand ,  was found to be at minimum during the phase @xmath19 . both components of wr 25",
    "are farthest apart at phase 0.5 ; therefore , the collision is weak , generating fewer x - rays .",
    "this indicates that the hard x - rays originate from the collision zone of the wind giving enhanced flux during periastron passage .",
    "@xcite and many other authors showed that strong winds from massive stars collide and generate hard x - rays , in addition to softer x - ray components due to intrinsic or individual components @xcite . the phase - locked x - ray variability could be a result of changing separation in an eccentric orbit of wr 25 .",
    "fig [ fig : bsep ] shows that the x - ray luminosity varies as a function of the inverse binary separation [ 1/(d / a ) ] .",
    "it appears that soft x - ray luminosity does not depend on the binary separation .",
    "however , it is clearly seen that the hard x - ray luminosity is linearly dependent on the inverse of the binary separation .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficients for  versus 1/(d / a ) and  versus 1/(d / a ) were derived to be -0.02 and 0.87 with a probability of no correlation found to be 0.94 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that the hard x - rays in wr 25 are due to the collision of winds .",
    "the wide massive binary systems whose x - ray luminosities follow the 1/d relation are cyg ob2 # 9 @xcite and hd 93205 @xcite .",
    "cyg ob2 # 8a and wr140 are the massive binary systems which deviate from expectations at periastron , since the collisions then become radiative @xcite . however , there are a few wide binary systems that do not follow the 1/d variation e.g. , wr 11 @xcite , wr 22 @xcite . the present x - ray light curves of wr 25 strongly support the idea that during the rise in x - ray emission around periastron passage the x - ray emission is primarily due to colliding winds @xcite .    using v @xmath21 mag , a distance of @xmath22 kpc , a bolometric correction of -4.5 @xcite a , nd an anomalous reddening of 4.5 mag @xcite , the bolometric luminosity of wr 25",
    "is calculated to be @xmath23 .",
    "the maximum and minimum values of  for wr 25 are thus calculated to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the derived value of  during periastron passage is similar to that derived by @xcite using einstein observations . during the phases @xmath26 and @xmath17 , the possible primary and secondary eclipse positions where the wn and o - type stars contributed more in soft x - rays , respectively , the  are calculated to be @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "these values of  are similar to those obtained for other single wr and o - type stars @xcite .",
    "the hard x - rays from wr 25 appear to be a result of collision of winds from binary companions .",
    "the gas in the colliding wind regions could either be adiabatic or radiative depending on the cooling parameter ( @xmath29 ) as @xmath30 @xcite , where @xmath31 is in units of 10@xmath32 km s@xmath6 , @xmath33 is the distance from the contact to star in units of @xmath34 km and @xmath35 is in units of @xmath36 yr@xmath6 . for @xmath37",
    ", the wind can be assumed to be adiabatic while for @xmath38 , it is roughly isothermal .",
    "the cooling parameter is directly proportional to the distance of contact ( @xmath33 ) ; as a consequence of this , @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this means that the shocked region will be adiabatic for longer period binaries .",
    "wr 25 is one of the longer orbital period binaries , indicating the shocked region is adiabatic .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that the contact of winds is close to the o - type star of wr 25 , the value of @xmath29 is calculated to be @xmath40 , indicating an adiabatic wind in the shocked region . in our analysis , the abundances of o , ne ,",
    "mg , si , s , ca , ar , fe and ni were found to be non - solar , which is expected from wr stars because they are in advanced evolutionary stages .",
    "the non - solar abundances of these elements could be due to the presence of hot plasma near the surface of the o4 star , due to the collision of strong supersonic winds from the wn6 star with the less powerful supersonic wind from o4 star . for wide binaries , @xcite showed that wr winds dominate the x - ray luminosity . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have also found that the shocked wr stellar wind dominates the x - ray emission for wr+o systems in the adiabatic limit .",
    "furthermore , the shocked volume and the emission measure near the o - type star may be dominated by wn winds ; therefore , the x - ray emitting plasma also shows non - solar abundances .",
    "when we compared the derived values of abundances of different elements for wr 25 with other wn - type stars , we found that the abundances of ne and s in wr 25 are similar to that of wn - type stars @xcite        the light curve of wr 25 in the v band shows minimum light near phase 0.75 , which could be possible position of eclipse when the wn star is behind the o - star .",
    "it appears that the wn star is brighter than the o - type star in the wr 25 system ; therefore , may observe an eclipse near phase 0.75 .",
    "@xcite also showed that o - type stars contribute a minimum of 15% to the total light of the system in the v band and @xcite had also noticed the photometric variation in wr 25 with a variability amplitude of 0.02 mag in the strmgren b - band on a time scale of @xmath5250 days .",
    "many other wr binaries also show phase - locked variability in the optical band and the variability is attributed to their binary nature @xcite .",
    "the presence of eclipses in x - ray and optical light curves indicates that the orbital plane of wr 25 has a high inclination angle .",
    "the minimum of the v - band light curve is consistent with the phase minimum at @xmath17 of the soft x - ray light curve .",
    "however , unlike to the soft x - ray light curve we could not see any other minimum in the v - band light curve near phase 0.03 , where  was also found to be maximum",
    ". this could be due to the poor phase coverage of the v - band light curve .",
    "the analysis of the present data shows that wr 25 is a colliding wind binary with an orbital period of @xmath41 days , where the hard x - rays could be due to the collision zone while soft x - rays could be attributed to individual components .",
