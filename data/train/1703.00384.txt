    "it has been shown that physical loudspeaker are causal system @xcite .",
    "a physical loudspeaker has inherent nonlinearities generating harmonic and intermodulation distortions in the output signal .",
    "the usual approach to correct audio signals is applying a linear filter due to computational advantages and simplicity .",
    "unfortunately , this approach leads to a magnitude amplification of the harmonics introduced by the nonlinear components .",
    "this means that the first order term of the system is well corrected while the error on the nonlinear terms becomes larger @xcite .",
    "+ to overcome this problem one can use volterra series to model the nonlinear behavior of the audio system @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use volterra series up to third order @xcite .",
    "the series kernel will be estimated through a learning algorithm .",
    "we will then compare the result with the linear filter approach .",
    "the normalized least mean square ( nlms ) algorithm will be used to estimate the first three orders of the volterra series , using input and output signals measured with polytec s laser doppler vibrometer .",
    "the choice of a laser interferometer , as compared to standard electro acoustic measurement with a microphone , offers the possibility to characterize the membrane dynamics directly with high precision measurement of the acoustic velocity .",
    "this instrument performs an analysis under simpler conditions , since free field or anechoic chamber have not been available . in this paper",
    "we do not consider the effects resulting from breakout modes or planar waves on the membrane .",
    "to account for these effects one could use more than one interferometer pointed at the membrane and calibrate the response of the chosen output signal .",
    "although this would be needed for an application , we did not deem it necessary to validate the methodology presented here .",
    "the results are presented as mean square error ( mse ) between the measured output signal and those obtained with the first , second and third order model .",
    "mse has been chosen due to its ability to represent the general optimization of the system , so it is easy to evaluate the method .",
    "different signals are tested in order to study the error in different situations .",
    "we show that the error decreases when higher orders of the model are taken into account .",
    "moreover a comparison is made between different signals used during training phase .",
    "a discrete causal time - invariant system with memory can be represented by the volterra series as , @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the input signal and @xmath2 is the output signal .",
    "@xmath3 , is the @xmath4-th order discrete kernel of volterra .",
    "the kernel can be considered as a generalization of the impulse response used in linear systems .",
    "+ the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the memory and they will impact on the filter precision and the performance .",
    "+ the kernel @xmath7 is symmetric as shown in @xcite , this property can be exploited in order to rewrite equation ( [ eq : volt_general ] ) in more convenient form , as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the memory length of the model , the limit is given by the interval @xmath10 $ ] in equation ( [ eq : volt_general ] ) .",
    "+ in this paper , the series is expanded to third order .",
    "the optimization presented in @xcite , exploiting the symmetry of the kernels , is used to perform a reduced computation of the volterra expansion .",
    "the optimized version is chosen because it saves memory and performs the computation in a faster way .",
    "equation ( [ eq : volt_rewritten ] ) can be rewritten , using the vector representation for all orders , as follows @xcite : @xmath11 where : @xmath12 ,   \\label{eq : x_first}\\ ] ] the second order is computed considering only the lower triangular part of the matrix obtained from @xmath13 , then @xmath14 , \\end{split } \\label{eq : x_second}\\ ] ] following the same logic we have @xmath15 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath16 can be computed similarly.$ ] ] .",
    "+ using these equations , one can see that the first order vector has @xmath9 coefficients , the second order vector @xmath17 and third order vector @xmath18 coefficients @xcite.the choice of the value @xmath9 is extremely important not only for the precision of the model , but also for the performance .",
    "the volterra kernels can be computed analytically or through an optimization algorithm .",
    "this algorithm is a variation of the well known least mean square ( lms , called normalized least mean square ( nlms ) which has become a standard method for nonlinear system characterization based on volterra series . in this paper",
    "we use optimization algorithm to calculate the kernel coefficients . a schematic representation of the algorithm",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lms ] .     is the input signal , @xmath19 is the desired signal , @xmath2 is the current output signal of the filter and @xmath20 is the error between @xmath19 and @xmath2 which is used to correct the filter . ]    to estimate the kernels a set of typical input signals is chosen .",
    "each input signal @xmath1 is sent to loudspeaker and its output is collected with a measurement system .",
    "the loudspeaker output represents the desired signal of the model , which we call @xmath19 .",
    "+ the set of input and desired signals represent the knowledge base of the loudspeaker , which will be used to extract the information about the system and build the model .",
    "if this set is not representative , the model will not be reliable . to avoid this risk ,",
    "we have used different signals including monochromatic signals , white noise , chirp and complex signals .",
    "+ the input @xmath1 is processed with the filter in order to obtain the output @xmath2 , related to current kernels . the correction step is now applied computing the difference between @xmath19 and @xmath2 , called @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath20 represents the filter error and it is used as weight into correction formula ( line 7 of algorithm [ alg : nlms ] ) .",
    "so , if the error is large , the correction will be large .",
    "+ algorithm [ alg : nlms ] explains the entire procedure in a formal way .",
    "here @xmath21 is the filter order , @xmath22 the length of the signals and @xmath23 the fixed threshold for the precision .",
    "@xmath24 is the i - th nonlinear model terms of equation ( [ eq : volt_conv ] ) and @xmath25 is a learning coefficient of the algorithm defined as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positive constants .",
    "@xmath27 should be selected under the constraint @xmath29 , in order to ensure stability and convergence @xcite and @xmath28 is needed to avoid division by @xmath30 .",
    "+   + initializing the volterra kernels @xmath24 with a random distribution turned out to lead to long convergence time . instead , using the identity as initialization has led to faster convergence due to the fact that both linear and nonlinear deviations of the system from the identity are small , i.e. for a speaker the input and the out are relatively similar up to a scaling factor .",
    "the initialization is made as follows :    * @xmath31 : the first component equal to @xmath32 , the others fixed to @xmath30 * @xmath33 , @xmath34 : all components are fixed to @xmath30",
    "the vibration analysis was performed using a polytec psv-400 scanning vibrometer . for single point measurements , the analog output of the laser was connected to oros or-38 multianalyzer . for loudspeaker excitation",
    "the internal function generator of or-38 was used .",
    "the time signals were processed by or-38 .",
    "the experiments were performed in the large experimental hall of the mechanical engineering department of the zurich university of applied sciences .",
    "this hall is neither equipped with an anechoic chamber nor acoustically treated . therefore background noise or reflections from the wall of the building",
    "can not be excluded .",
    "the loudspeaker was mounted on top of a heavy vibration table ( more than five meters away from any wall ) with its cone facing the open part of the room .",
    "the laser vibrometer was placed approximately 3 m from the loudspeaker in order to minimze vibrations of the laser head .",
    "a schematic representation can be seen in fig [ fig : exp_config ] .        in order to measure the response of the loudspeaker different excitation signals",
    "were used : pure sine at different frequencies , sine sweep , periodic chirp and random noise .",
    "in order to obtain a better knowledge of the volterra filter capabilities , we tested the trained models with different input signals including chirp , monochromatic and superimposed signals . + the benefits of using these signals are as follows : chirp is useful because the frequencies are distributed in the entire spectrum of interest .",
    "for this reason , the output signal represents a good approximation of the system behavior in general .",
    "monochromatic signals can show the original frequency ( fundamental frequency ) and the contribution of non linear terms ( harmonics ) . with the superimposed signals , denoted as _",
    "multisine _ , we can test intermodulations .",
    "+ the results are summarized in table [ tab : output_range ] to [ tab : comparison_complex ] , organized as follows : table [ tab : output_range ] , the first column shows the signals used for test and the second column shows the amplitude range for each signal . in table [ tab : comparison_whitenoise ] and table [ tab : comparison_complex ] a more detailed view is presented .",
    "the first column shows the signal used for test and the rest of columns show the mse of the first , second and third order filter .",
    "+    .amplitude range of test signals [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure [ fig : comparison_avg ] and [ fig : comparison_max ] show the average and maximum value of the mean squared error for both experiments . as it can be seen from both figures , higher order models result in a decrease in both maximum and average",
    "mean squared error .",
    "while we expect a more complex model to better model nonlinear distortions , we also observe a trend where white noise plus chirp signal performs better than just white noise as training signal .",
    "+ more specifically , in the case of white nose plus chirp and a third order filter the mean of mse is @xmath35 lower than the mse obtained form the first order filter .",
    "for the same signal and the second order filter this reduction is only @xmath36 . on the other hand even using a third order filter only achieves a @xmath37 reduction when trained on white noise . considering the max of mse which is the performance in the worse case",
    ", the third order filter achieves an improvement of @xmath38 compared to @xmath39 of the second order filter . training a third order filter with only white noise we obtain an improvement of @xmath40 .",
    "the results from table [ tab : comparison_complex ] show also how the mse depends on the frequency of the input signal .",
    "in particular while the increasing order of the filters pays off for a @xmath41 sinusoidal , it does not significantly improve the mse for @xmath42 .",
    "in this paper , a nonlinear model has been developed in order to simulate the behavior of a loudspeaker .",
    "the goal of this study was to asses the simulation improvements for second and third order nonlinear filters compared to linear filters .",
    "+ in order to find a model which improves the accuracy of linear filters preserving good generalization abilities , several signals have been used for testing .",
    "we have shown that white noise can be used to train volterra kernels with a good accuracy .",
    "furthermore a combination of white noise and chirp has been successfully used to improve the results .",
    "we also explored the hyperparameters of the system like memory and learning parameters and shown that the error , expressed as mse , decreases with higher order of the model .",
    "the results also show a dependency on the form and frequency of the signal .",
