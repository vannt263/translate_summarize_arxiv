    "the origin of cp violation in nature is presently one of the most important open questions in particle physics .",
    "indeed , the main goal of the experiments devoted to the study of @xmath1 meson decays is either to confirm the picture offered by the standard model ( sm ) or to provide evidences of cp violation mechanisms originated from new physics . among the various cp - odd observables in @xmath1 physics ,",
    "attention is mostly concentrated in the `` gold - plated '' channel @xmath2 .",
    "according to the sm picture , from the analysis of a time - dependent cp asymmetry observed in these decays it is possible to get a `` clean '' measurement of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is one of the angles of the so - called unitarity triangle @xcite .",
    "recent measurements by belle and babar collaborations , together with previous results from aleph , opal and cdf , lead to the ( averaged ) value @xmath5 , which is in good agreement with the constraints imposed by other measured cp - conserving and cp - violating observables @xcite .",
    "in fact , the common belief is that the sm is nothing but an effective manifestation of some underlying fundamental theory . in this way ,",
    "all tests of the standard mechanism of cp violation , as well as the exploration of signatures of nonstandard physics , become relevant . one important characteristic of the sm is that it includes only one source of cp violation , namely a complex phase in the quark mixing matrix @xmath6 . in general , since overall phases of transition amplitudes are not observable , one has to deal with interference effects in order to search for measurable cp - violating quantities . within the sm , there are some specific processes in which the amplitude is either dominated by a single contribution , or in which several contributions are significant , all of them carrying the same weak phase . in these situations , weak sm phases",
    "are unobservable , and asymmetries between cp conjugated processes are expected to be vanishingly small .",
    "this offers an attractive window to search for evidences of new physics , and is the main motivation for this work .",
    "we show here that three body decays @xmath7 and @xmath8 provide an interesting scenario to look for such effects . for these processes ,",
    "the main contributions to the decay amplitude in the sm carry a common weak phase , therefore the measurement of relative cp - violating phases , leading to an asymmetry between @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays , would represent a signal of new physics .",
    "we discuss here the possibility of performing these measurements by means of a dalitz plot ( dp ) fit analysis . in general",
    ", three body decays of mesons proceed through intermediate resonant channels , and the dp fit analysis allows a direct experimental access to the amplitudes and phases of the main contributions  @xcite . the usage of this technique for a clean extraction of cp - odd phases has already been proposed in the literature  @xcite in relation with other cp - violating observables , more precisely , to get clean measurements of the weak angle @xmath11 within the sm . from the experimental point of view , the usage of charged @xmath1 mesons has the advantage of avoiding flavor  tagging difficulties .",
    "in addition , the processes @xmath12 appear to be statistically favored , in view of their relatively high branching ratios of about 1% .    in order to evaluate the experimental perspectives",
    ", we perform a monte carlo simulation of the actual processes , applying the dp fit technique to evaluate the error in the extraction of possible cp - violating phases",
    ". then we perform a rough theoretical analysis , discussing the expected magnitude of cp violation effects that could arise beyond the sm . according to our results ,",
    "the considered channels offer a promising scenario to obtain a clear signature of new physics . in the worst case",
    ", the lack of evidences would allow to improve the present bounds on the parameters of the model under consideration .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we describe the general framework , introducing the cp - violating observables . in sect .",
    "iii we detail the dp fit procedure and present the results of our simulations .",
    "iv is devoted to the theoretical discussion of new physics effects , while in sect .",
    "v we summarize our main results .",
    "in this section we describe how the dp fit technique can be applied to disentangle possible effects of new physics in @xmath12 decays . in principle , these processes are expected to proceed through various intermediate resonances , as well as through a direct , nonresonant channel . the total branching ratio will result from the interference of all these contributions .",
    "the dalitz plot maximum likelihood technique is a powerful tool to get a clean disentanglement of the relevant contributing channels , allowing to measure the ratios between the different partial amplitudes _ together with their relative phases_. this can be used to perform a clean extraction of cp - violating phases , avoiding many theoretical uncertainties .",
    "let us begin by summarizing the main steps of this procedure .",
    "more details on these ideas can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in general , for a given three body decay , in the dp fitting analysis of experimental data one defines a fitting function @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the usual dp phase space variables . in our case",
    "this function can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 are definite functions corresponding to each partial channel , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real parameters that emerge as outputs from the fit .",
    "the index @xmath22 labels the intermediate resonant channels , as well as the nonresonant one . for the resonant channels , the main phase space dependence of the functions @xmath19",
    "is given by the breit - wigner ( bw ) shape characterizing the resonances , together with definite angular functions which depend on the spin of the corresponding resonant state ( we come back to this issues in the next section ) .",
    "the nonresonant decay amplitude is assumed to be constant in most experimental analyses .",
    "this fitting technique has proven to be successful to describe e.g.  three body decays of @xmath23 mesons @xcite .",
    "in those analyses the phases @xmath21 have been extracted with combined statistical and systematic errors as small as a few degrees , in experiments with a few thousands reconstructed events .",
    "in general , the phases @xmath21 can be written as the sum of a `` strong '' ( cp - conserving ) phase @xmath24 and a `` weak '' ( cp - violating ) phase @xmath25 .",
    "these can not be measured separately by a single fit .",
    "nevertheless , comparing the outputs from the cp - conjugated @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay experiments one can extract both phases @xmath24 and @xmath25 simply from @xmath26 where @xmath27 stands for the phases measured from the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) decays .",
    "it is worth to notice that weak phases can be extracted even in the limit where strong phases @xmath24 are vanishingly small which is expected to be the case in many @xmath1 decays , owing to the large @xmath28 quark mass .",
    "this represents a remarkable advantage with respect to most proposals of measuring cp asymmetries in charged @xmath1 decays . in general , in order to get a sizable asymmetry , one requires the presence of strong fsi phases , which introduce a significant theoretical uncertainty . in our case , however , strong phases are already supplied by the resonance widths in the bw functions  @xcite , and no theoretical estimation of fsi phases is needed .",
    "moreover , the latter can be independently obtained from the fit by means of eq .",
    "( [ strong ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice that for the fitting procedure to apply , it is necessary that the decay amplitude receives contributions from at least two intermediate channels carrying different cp violating phases .",
    "indeed , an overall phase is physically meaningless , and the dp fit only allows the measurement of relative phases between different channels .",
    "let us now analyze the case of the decays @xmath12 in the framework of a theory including physics beyond the sm .",
    "for each intermediate channel , it is natural to assume that new physics occurs at a relatively high energy scale , therefore its effects can be decoupled from the resonance bw functions , the angular functions , and other possible form factors in @xmath29 arising from low - energy hadronic interactions . accordingly , the fitting function @xmath30 will be still of the form proposed in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , with the same functions @xmath19 , and now the complex weights @xmath31 will include the effects of new physics : @xmath32 here the index @xmath33 refers to the experimentally measurable quantities ( outputs of the dp fit ) , whereas @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote standard model and new physics contributions respectively .",
    "the @xmath36 signs correspond to decays of @xmath37 mesons .    within the sm ,",
    "the short - distance effective hamiltonian relevant for the decays @xmath12 has been studied in detail @xcite , including the effects of strong and electroweak penguin operators . the situation is similar as in the `` gold - plated '' channel @xmath38 , in the sense that the main contributions ( both tree and penguin ) to the effective operators carry the same weak phase . in this way",
    ", this phase is expected to factorize , being common to all ( resonant and nonresonant ) channels contributing to the decay .",
    "one could thus conventionally set @xmath39 for all @xmath22 , and no cp asymmetry should be observed between @xmath9 and @xmath10 decay patterns in absence of new physics , where the effect is found to be about 0.2% . ] . on the contrary ,",
    "if new physics is present , the situation may be different . to simplify the analysis ,",
    "let us assume that only two intermediate channels contribute , namely those mediated by resonances and @xmath40 say channels 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "this is a natural assumption , since in fact they are expected to largely dominate the decay ( in any case , if other intermediate channels were shown to provide significant contributions , the procedure we describe here can still be followed on the same grounds ) . in this two - channel case",
    ", only the relative phases between both contributions 1 and 2 can be measured . from eq .",
    "( [ ampgen ] ) , one has @xmath41",
    "+ \\delta_1^{sm } - \\delta_2^{sm}\\;. \\label{diff}\\ ] ]    the theoretical framework can be simplified by introducing some natural assumptions .",
    "first , it is reasonable to think that the resonance hadronization and decay processes which are governed by strong interactions in the nonperturbative regime can be disentangled from the effects of new physics , the latter taking place at a high energy scale .",
    "in addition , it is usual to assume that strong fsi are the main source for strong phases @xmath24 , since high energy contributions to cp - conserving phases arising from absorptive parts of qcd and electroweak loop diagrams are shown to be suppressed @xcite . in this way , for each resonant channel strong phases should factorize out , i.e.  @xmath42 . on the other hand , in most scenarios of new physics as well as in the sm",
    "cp - violating phases are essentially determined by the flavor content of the quarks entering the diagrams that dominate the @xmath28 quark decay .",
    "if this is the case , since both resonant states @xmath43 and @xmath44 have the same quark content , one expects that the new cp - violating phases obey @xmath45 , remaining constant along the phase space .",
    "once these assumptions have been taken into account , the measurable complex weights in eq .",
    "( [ ampgen ] ) can be written as @xmath46 we have dropped here the @xmath36 signs in @xmath47 , since the assumption @xmath48 implies @xmath49 . and",
    "@xmath10 decays , providing a consistency test for our assumptions on the strong phases . ]",
    "the expression for the relative phases @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) simplifies now to @xmath51    as stated , we are interested in the difference between the relative phases for the cp - conjugated decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which is an observable of cp violation .",
    "this is given by @xmath52 finally , assuming that new physics contributions are small when compared to sm amplitudes , i.e. , @xmath53 , we end up with @xmath54 notice that this quantity is independent of any cp - conserving phase .",
    "it only depends on the ( in principle , unknown ) real amplitudes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and on the ( also unknown ) cp - violating phase @xmath57 .",
    "as we have discussed above , @xmath58 vanishes in the absence of new physics .",
    "this is a convenient situation for the search of clean effects of physics beyond the sm , provided that the factors in the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ relphase ] ) are large enough to allow a clear experimental signature . the perspectives in this sense are addressed in the next sections .",
    "in this section we make an estimate of the precision that may be reached in the measurement of the phase difference @xmath58 in @xmath12 decays .",
    "this will indicate , according to the result in eq.([relphase ] ) , the minimum size of new physics contributions to the decay amplitudes needed to yield a distinguishable experimental signal .",
    "one important reason for which the channels considered here deserve special attention is their relatively high statistics .",
    "since the branching ratios for @xmath12 are as large as @xmath59 1% , after a couple of years of full run of lhcb , and assuming a 20% reconstruction efficiency , one should end up with some @xmath60 reconstructed events in each @xmath9 and @xmath10 dalitz plots .",
    "this is a large number , taking into account that dp fits performed for @xmath23 meson decays with much less events have led to the measurement of relative phases with statistical errors of just a few degrees @xcite .",
    "however , the processes considered here are very different from those . indeed , even if such a large number of events will certainly give a very precise measurement of the branching fractions for each partial channel i.e .",
    ", the quantities @xmath47 , a precise measurement of phases requires not only large statistics but also a large interference region between the different intermediate channels .",
    "it is not obvious that this will be the case for @xmath12 decays , since the involved resonances are very narrow , their widths laying below 1 mev  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the actual experimental feasibility of our proposal , we have carried out a monte carlo simulation of the decays .",
    "our goal is to generate @xmath60 events in the dalitz plot , and then to perform a dalitz plot fit analysis in order to determine if the phases can be successfully extracted with a small statistical error . clearly",
    ", this simulation does not account for the details concerning the detectors .",
    "the possible impact of systematic errors will be discussed below .",
    "we have generated @xmath60 events using a decay amplitude of the form in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) . as a first guess ,",
    "we include in the decay only three channels , namely those mediated by the resonances @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the direct nonresonant decay @xmath63 . the form of the functions @xmath19 for the resonances @xmath64 is @xcite @xmath65 where the invariant masses @xmath66 are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , @xmath67 is a form factor , and @xmath68 is the breit - wigner function @xmath69 @xmath70 being the resonance masses ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) . for each @xmath22 , the @xmath1 and @xmath73 meson three - momenta in eq .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) are evaluated in the rest frame of the corresponding intermediate resonance .",
    "we have taken the usual expressions  @xcite for the form factors decays is in general unknown . we have considered expressions similar to those used for @xmath23 decays , finding that their incidence is not relevant to the discussion in this work . ] and for the momentum - dependent width @xmath74 .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the on - shell resonance width , and @xmath77 stands for the three - momentum of the resonance decay products when the resonance mass is @xmath78 .",
    "the shape of the nonresonant decay amplitude , which is in general unknown  @xcite , has been taken as it is usually done as a constant function . in any case , as it is discussed below , this assumption has a negligible impact on our results .    in order to carry out the generation of events , we need to introduce as input data the values for the physical quantities @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the resonance widths .",
    "the expected relative weights @xmath20 of the two resonant channels can be obtained from the known branching ratios @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we have  @xcite @xmath83 on the other hand , the nonresonant decay amplitude is uncertain ; it is just expected to be smaller than the resonant channels .",
    "taking into account that only the relative values between the three coefficients @xmath20 have a physical meaning in the simulation , we have taken @xmath84 and @xmath85 , while for @xmath86 we have considered different values , ranging from 0 to 0.1 . concerning the phases @xmath21 ,",
    "one expects cp - conserving parts to be relatively small , whereas the cp - violating sm phase is essentially the same for all amplitudes and can be factorized out .",
    "thus , assuming that sm contributions dominate , it is reasonable to choose all phases @xmath21 in our numerical simulation to be small numbers .",
    "in fact , it will be seen that this assumption is not relevant to our conclusions .",
    "finally , other relevant inputs in our simulation are the on - shell widths @xmath76 of both resonances : events coming from a narrow resonance should be concentrated in a given region of the plot , hence the interference region between both resonances is expected to be relatively small .",
    "present measurements of @xmath61 and @xmath62 widths are not conclusive , giving in both cases only upper bounds of about 2 mev . for our simulations , we have chosen to consider values ranging from 0.01 to 1 mev .",
    "the recent measurement of the @xmath87 width , which is found to be around 0.1 mev @xcite , can be thought as a hint of the expected orders of magnitude .",
    "decay ]    as an example , we show in fig .  1 the dalitz plot generated with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and equal widths of 1 mev for both resonances ( besides the already given values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "one observes that , even if both resonances are quite narrow , the events appear to be spread out in a large region of the plot .",
    "this is the consequence of a purely kinematic effect , due to the fact that both resonances are located very close to the threshold of the phase space .",
    "this effect compensates the narrow width suppression , and brings a good hope to extract the relative phases successfully .    after carrying out this simulation of the decay",
    ", we have performed a fit of the data according to the fitting function given in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , where now the coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 are left as free parameters .",
    "in fact , as explained above , the fit provides only _ relative _ values for both amplitudes and phases @xcite , therefore we have kept fixed the reference values @xmath92 and @xmath89 .",
    "the result of the fit is given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the method allows to extract the phase @xmath94 with a statistical error as small as @xmath95 .     +    .fitting results of the monte carlo sample .",
    "the events have been generated with @xmath93 , @xmath90 , @xmath88 , @xmath91 , and @xmath96 mev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before ending this section let us say a few words about systematic ( experimental ) errors in the extraction of phases .",
    "the evaluation of these errors is in general a quite difficult task . in order to carry out the complete analysis",
    ", one should perform a full numerical simulation of the experiment including the detector , which is out of the scope of this paper . nevertheless , in order to have an estimate we can take into account the results from recent dp analyses @xcite .",
    "the latter suggest that the systematic error in the measurement of phases for intermediate channels with large branching fractions should not be above a few degrees , i.e.  of the same order of those quoted in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "let us now turn back to eq .",
    "( [ relphase ] ) and analyze the theoretical expectations for the size of @xmath97 in the context of a theory beyond the sm , in order to evaluate if this observable has potential chances to provide experimental evidences of new physics . to carry out the theoretical analysis we take into account the low - energy effective hamiltonian relevant for the processes under consideration , including qcd corrections at the leading order . then , to deal with long - range matrix elements , we use the simple factorization approach  @xcite , which should be adequate to estimate the significance of the new contributions @xcite .    in view of the large hadronic uncertainties and the usual amount of freedom to fix new physics parameters",
    ", we do not intend to perform an accurate calculation of possible nonstandard contributions to the @xmath12 decay amplitude .",
    "just as an illustrative example , we consider the rather representative framework of multihiggs models , showing that the situation becomes quite promising if nonstandard contributions to penguin diagrams are comparable to those arising from sm physics .",
    "our theoretical analysis is based on the @xmath98 effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 are wilson coefficients evaluated at a renormalization scale @xmath101 , and @xmath102 are local operators , @xmath103 here @xmath104 refers to the lorentz structure @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath4 stand for @xmath107 color indices , @xmath108 are generators of @xmath107 color transformations and @xmath109 denotes the gluonic field strength tensor .",
    "contributions from electroweak penguins will not be taken into account , therefore these operators have not been included in ( [ hamilt ] ) .",
    "we will also neglect the effect of the electromagnetic dipole operator . within the sm ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath100 can be calculated at the scale @xmath110 , and then evolved to @xmath101 through the renormalization group equations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 factors corresponding to each operator have been explicitly separated in ( [ hamilt ] ) , so that with good approximation the coefficients @xmath100 in the sm can be assumed to be real numbers . moreover , in view of the unitarity of the @xmath6 matrix , one has @xmath111 , where the correction due to the @xmath112 term is about 5% . in this way , for the case under consideration , the cp - violating phase carried by the penguin contributions in the sm is approximately the same as that coming from the tree operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and will factorize out for the decay amplitudes of interest ( the contribution of the @xmath115 term to the full amplitude will be below 0.5% if , as expected , the total penguin amplitude does not exceed 10% of the tree piece ) . in a given extension of the sm ,",
    "however , the coefficients @xmath100 will carry in general nonvanishing cp - violating phases @xmath116 , allowing for the interference effects discussed in the previous sections .    in general , in a theory including physics beyond the sm",
    ", one expects that the new particles can be integrated out at the @xmath110 scale , leading to new contributions to the coefficients @xmath117 .",
    "however , since the new particles have been integrated out , the running of the coefficients down to @xmath101 proceeds just as in the sm  @xcite .",
    "this running of sm coefficients has been analyzed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and will not be repeated here .    in the evaluation of the amplitudes @xmath118 ,",
    "the scale and renormalization scheme dependence introduced by the coefficients @xmath100 should be compensated by that of the matrix elements of the quark operators @xmath102 between the hadronic states . however , as stated above , to evaluate these quantities we will use the factorization ansatz , and in this approach the matrix elements are written in terms of decay constants and form factors , which are both scale and renormalization scheme independent . in order to achieve the required cancellation ,",
    "it is possible @xcite to calculate the one - loop corrections to the partonic matrix elements @xmath119 , and to define new effective coefficients @xmath120 such that the one - loop quark - level matrix elements read @xmath121 at nlo these effective coefficients will be given by the original @xmath100 plus qcd corrections , @xmath122 the analytic expressions for the functions @xmath123 can be found in refs .",
    "it can be shown that now the effective coefficients @xmath120 are scale and scheme independent , as well as gauge invariant and infrared safe  @xcite .",
    "an important point is that the corrections introduced in eq .",
    "( [ efect ] ) involve the coefficient @xmath124 , which can receive important contributions coming from nonstandard physics , as occurs e.g.  in the case of two - higgs - doublet models @xcite .",
    "even if the operator @xmath125 does not contribute directly to the @xmath126 decay amplitudes in the factorization approach , the combination in ( [ efect ] ) implies that the new physics corrections to @xmath124 are translated to other effective coefficients @xmath120 and thus to the decay amplitude .",
    "the previous analysis can be now applied to the decays of our interest , namely the resonant processes @xmath127 ; @xmath128 and @xmath129 ; @xmath130 that dominate the three body decay @xmath131 . in the described framework , the relevant two - body amplitudes @xmath132 and @xmath133 where the subindex @xmath134 denotes that the matrix element is evaluated within the factorization approximation .",
    "the factor @xmath135 includes the effective coefficients @xmath120 , whereas @xmath136 contains the form factors related to the factorized amplitudes .",

    "in fact , eqs .",
    "( [ x2 ] ) have been quoted only for completeness , since the factors @xmath144 cancel out in our estimation for @xmath97 .",
    "this can be seen by noticing that the expression for @xmath97 in ( [ relphase ] ) involves ratios between sm and new physics amplitudes . according to previous assumptions , the effects of new physics are only present in the effective coefficients @xmath120 or , equivalently , @xmath149",
    ", therefore any global factor will cancel .",
    "one has in this way @xmath150 where @xmath151 stand for the mass ratio @xmath152 $ ] , and as in the previous sections we have assigned labels 1 and 2 to the channels mediated by the resonances @xmath153 and @xmath154 respectively .",
    "average values of quark masses yield @xmath155 .    in order to analyze the possible np effects in our observable @xmath156 ,",
    "let us consider the typical situation of a theory including an extended scalar sector . in the case of multihiggs ( mh ) models , the scalar - mediated tree contributions to @xmath113 and @xmath114 can be neglected , since in general scalar couplings are proportional to the current quark masses of the involved vertices . on the other hand ,",
    "penguin - like diagrams mediated by the new scalars involve vertices which are proportional to the top quark mass , thus they are potentially important .",
    "then , while sm amplitudes are dominated by tree contributions ( @xmath157 for @xmath158 ) , in a mh scheme the main effect of the extended scalar sector on @xmath159 and @xmath160 occurs through the new contributions to the effective coefficients @xmath161 and @xmath162 . in this way , from eqs .",
    "( [ relphase ] ) and ( [ acoc ] ) one gets @xmath163 as a first outcome from this expression , it is seen that the ratios @xmath164 do not cancel with each other , consequently the asymmetry @xmath58 is in principle nonzero .",
    "even if the result in ( [ cpthdm ] ) is just an estimate , it can be taken into account in order to show that new physics effects can be significant enough to provide an observable signal . according to the analysis presented in the previous section ,",
    "this would be achieved if new physics contributions to @xmath162 reach about 10% of the sm tree amplitude , and carry a cp - violating phase of order one ( one would obtain in this case an asymmetry @xmath58 of about 10 degrees ) . within the sm , the effective coefficients @xmath165 ( tree ) and @xmath166 ( penguin )",
    "are estimated to be approximately 1 and @xmath167 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , one would have important chances of measuring nonstandard physics if new contributions to @xmath162 carrying large cp - violating phases are comparable in size to sm ones .",
    "it is worth to point out that this level of contribution of nonstandard physics is indeed suggested by some puzzling experimental results on penguin - dominated modes , such as the @xmath168 branching ratios @xcite and the time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath169 @xcite .",
    "the experimental values for these observables are at least @xmath170 away from sm expectations , and can be seen as indications of large new physics effects at the penguin level .",
    "we believe that these experimental observations on penguin - dominated @xmath1 decay channels already provide a substancial ground to encourage the dp analysis of @xmath12 proposed here . on the other hand , we point out that the room for nonstandard contributions to penguin amplitudes and thus to the phase difference @xmath58 is relatively large , mainly due to the existing theoretical uncertainties in the evaluation of sm amplitudes , and to the large number of unknown parameters included in most scenarios of new physics . to be definite ,",
    "let us take here as an example one of the simplest possible extensions of the sm , namely a two - higgs - doublet model ( thdm ) type iii .",
    "in particular , we consider a minimal scenario @xcite which does not include tree level fcnc , and the number of new parameters is reduced to four ( three yukawa couplings parameters plus the charged higgs mass ) . in this framework",
    "the main new contributions to @xmath28 quark decays arise from one - loop diagrams involving a virtual top quark , while neutral higgs - mediated diagrams are shown to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "as stated , in this kind of models the largest new contributions to the amplitudes @xmath138 come through the dipole coefficient @xmath124 , and the allowed space for the new parameters is mainly constrained by the effects on @xmath171 decays @xcite .",
    "taking into account the bounds in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to estimate the allowed values for both the amplitude @xmath162 and the cp - violating phase @xmath172 .",
    "we find that within this model the phase difference @xmath58 can be as large as 3 degrees , which , according to the analysis sect .",
    "iii , would be around the limit of observability for the number of events considered .",
    "the example below should be taken just as an illustration to show the potentiality of our analysis through a simple manageable case .",
    "clearly , the inclusion of more degrees of freedom would relax the experimental bounds on the new model parameters ( imposed e.g.  by the chosen mechanism to avoid unwanted flavor changing neutral transitions ) , allowing higher values for the measurable phase difference @xmath97 which will exceed the observability limits .",
    "in addition , other possible frameworks of nonstandard physics have been shown to provide enhancement effects on penguin - dominated processes , offering an explanation for the puzzling time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath169 . among the most popular scenarios , recent analyses",
    "include r - parity violating supersymmetry @xcite , left - right supersymmetric models @xcite , and theories including warped extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "in all these models which include in general a rather large number of new parameters , it has been shown that new physics contributions can be of the same order as sm penguin amplitudes . in this way",
    ", their effects on the @xmath173 channel could provide an observable signal in the dp analysis of @xmath12 decays proposed here .",
    "we discuss the possible measurement of nonstandard cp violation in @xmath12 , exploiting the fact that for these processes the asymmetry between @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays is expected to be negligibly small in the standard model .",
    "the presence of two resonant channels provides the necessary interference to allow for cp asymmetries in the differential decay width , even in the limit of vanishing strong rescattering phases .    in order to measure the cp - odd phases entering the interfering contributions to the total decay amplitude",
    ", we propose to use the dalitz plot fit technique .",
    "this allows a clean disentanglement of relative phases , independent of theoretical uncertainties arising from fsi effects .",
    "the expected quality of the experimental measurements has been estimated by means of a monte carlo simulation of the decays , from which we conclude that the phases can be extracted with a statistical error not larger than a couple of degrees , provided that the widths of the intermediate @xmath174 and @xmath154 resonances are at least of the order of a hundred kev . on the theoretical side , within the framework of generalized factorization",
    "we perform a rough estimation of possible nonstandard cp violation effects on the interfering amplitudes .",
    "we take as an example the typical case of a multihiggs model , showing that the level of accuracy of the dp fit measurements can be sufficient to reveal effects of new physics .",
    "let us finally stress that tree - dominated decays like @xmath12 are usually not regarded as good candidates to reveal new physics , since the effects on branching ratios are not expected to be strong enough to be separated from the theoretical errors .",
    "our proposal represents a possible way of detecting these effects by means of cp asymmetries , which can allow the disentanglement of new physics contributions to penguin - like operators in a theoretically simple way .",
