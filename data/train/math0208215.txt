    "@xcite , @xcite ) the characterizations in ( [ b ] ) and in particular ( [ c ] ) are more appropriate .",
    "one of the main objectives in the study of complex crowns is to achieve a better understanding of harmonic analyis on symmetric spaces .",
    "for example it was shown in @xcite that all non - compactly causal symmetric spaces @xmath19 associated to @xmath9 appear in the so - called _ distinguished boundary _ of @xmath2 .",
    "subsequently this was used in @xcite to construct a hardy - space for non - compactly causal symmetric spaces @xmath19 yielding first progress towards a geometric realization of some of the continuous series in @xmath20 ( gelfand - gindikin program ) .",
    "the motivation for this article stems from our interest to obtain a first understanding of the various kinds of weighted bergman - spaces which can be associated with @xmath2 , most notably fock - spaces which play a prominent role in the context of the heat kernel transform on @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . intimately related to this circle of problems is the growth behavior of analytically continued spherical functions .",
    "a spherical function @xmath21 on @xmath5 is left @xmath22-invariant , hence its analytic continuation @xmath23 to @xmath2 is necessarily ( locally ) @xmath24-invariant .",

    "it turned out that the above mentioned difficulties can be overcome , and , moreover , by settling the technical problems we could make new observations regarding the structure theory of complex crowns .",
    "this paper focuses mostly on @xmath29 , but we made an effort to present results in a fashion which allows immediate generalization to all semisimple lie groups .",
