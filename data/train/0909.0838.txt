    "a proper understanding of neutrino induced pion production is essential for the interpretation of current neutrino oscillations experiments .",
    "a good knowledge of the neutrino energy is required for a precise determination of oscillation parameters in @xmath1 disappearance measurements .",
    "these experiments search for a distortion in the neutrino flux at the detector positioned far away from the source . by comparing both , near and far neutrino energy spectra , one gains information about the oscillation probability and with that about mixing angles and mass squared differences .",
    "however , the neutrino energy is not measurable directly but has to be reconstructed from the reaction products .",
    "present oscillation experiments use the ccqe reaction both as signal event and to reconstruct the neutrino energy from the outgoing muon with two - body kinematics assuming the target nucleon is at rest .",
    "ccqe is defined as @xmath2 on a single nucleon ; in the nucleus , ccqe is masked by final - state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "thus , the correct identification of ccqe events is directly related to the question of how fsi influence the event selection .",
    "the main background to ccqe is cc@xmath0 production . if the pion is absorbed in the nucleus and/or not seen in the detector , these events can be misidentified as ccqe . consequently , a proper understanding of ccqe _ and _ cc@xmath0 is essential for the reconstruction of the neutrino energy .    the main task in a @xmath3 appearance experiment like miniboone is to detect electron neutrinos in a ( almost ) pure @xmath1 beam .",
    "the signal event , the @xmath3 ccqe interaction , is dominated by background .",
    "a major problem comes from misidentified events , mainly because of the fact , that the miniboone detector can not distinguish between a photon and an electron .",
    "thus , @xmath1 induced neutral current @xmath4 production , where the @xmath4 decays into two @xmath5s , is the major source of background when one of the photons is not seen or both cherenkov rings overlap .",
    "as all of the present oscillations experiments use nuclear targets , it is mandatory to consider fsi , i.e. , pion rescattering , with and without charge exchange , and absorption in the nuclear medium .",
    "a realistic treatment of the fsi can be achieved in the framework of a coupled - channel transport theory  the gibuu model .    after a brief review of our model",
    ", we first discuss the impact of pion production on ccqe measurements .",
    "we further investigate the influence of nuclear effects on cc@xmath0 and nc@xmath6 cross sections , and , where possible , we confront our model to recent data measured at miniboone .",
    "we treat neutrino - nucleus scattering as a two - step process . in the initial - state step , the neutrinos",
    "interact with nucleons embedded in the nuclear medium . in the final - state step ,",
    "the outgoing particles of the initial reaction are propagated through the nucleus using a hadronic transport approach .    in the energy region",
    "relevant for miniboone , sciboone and k2k , the elementary @xmath7 reaction is dominated by two processes : quasielastic scattering and the excitation of the @xmath8 resonance ( p@xmath9(1232 ) ) . additionally , our model includes the excitation of 12 @xmath10 and @xmath8 resonances with invariant masses less than 2 gev and also a non - resonant single - pion background .",
    "the nucleon , @xmath11 and @xmath12 vector form factors are based on recent electron - scattering data while the axial couplings are obtained assuming pcac ( partial conservation of the axial current ) .",
    "the @xmath13 dependence of the nucleon and @xmath11 axial form factors , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , is fitted to bubble chamber neutrino - scattering data .",
    "the neutrino - nucleon cross sections are modified in the nuclear medium .",
    "bound nucleons are treated within a local thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "they are exposed to a mean - field potential which depends on density and momentum .",
    "we account for this by evaluating the above cross sections with full in - medium kinematics , i.e. , hadronic tensor and phase - space factors are evaluated with in - medium four - vectors .",
    "we also take pauli blocking and collisional broadening of the outgoing hadrons into account . our model for neutrino-(bound)nucleon scattering",
    "is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "after the initial neutrino - nucleon interaction , the produced particles propagate out of the nucleus . during propagation",
    "they undergo fsi which are simulated with the coupled - channel semi - classical gibuu transport model ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is based on the buu equation which describes the space - time evolution of a many - particle system in a mean - field potential including a collision term .",
    "nucleons and resonances acquire medium - modified spectral functions and are propagated off - shell .",
    "herby we ensure , that vacuum spectral functions are recovered after leaving the nucleus .",
    "the collision term accounts for changes ( gain and loss ) in the phase - space density due to elastic and inelastic collisions between the particles , and also to particle decays into other hadrons .",
    "baryon - meson two - body interactions ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) are described by resonance contributions and a small non - resonant background term ; baryon - baryon cross sections ( e.g. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are either fitted to data or calculated , e.g. , in pion exchange models .",
    "the three - body channels @xmath21 and @xmath22 are also included .",
    "the buu equations for all particle species are thus coupled through the collision term and also through the potentials .",
    "such a coupled - channel treatment is required to account for side feeding into different channels .",
    "one challenge is to identify _ true _ ccqe events in the detector , i.e. , muons originating from an initial qe process . to be more precise , true",
    "ccqe corresponds to the inclusive ccqe cross section including all medium effects , or , in other words , the ccqe cross section before fsi .",
    "the difficulty comes from the fact that the true ccqe events are masked by fsi in a detector built from nuclei .",
    "the fsi lead to misidentified events , e.g. , an initial @xmath8 whose decay pion is absorbed or which undergoes `` pion - less decay '' can count as ccqe event  we call this type of background events `` fake ccqe '' events .",
    "we denote every event which looks like a ccqe event by `` ccqe - like '' .    in general , at cherenkov detectors such as miniboone ccqe - like events",
    "are all those where no pion is detected while in tracking detectors such as k2k - scibar / scifi ccqe - like events are those where a single proton track is visible and at the same time no pions are detected .    to investigate the relation between the ccqe - like and true ccqe cross section , we show their ratio as a function of proton and pion momentum thresholds in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccqelike_over_trueccqe_thresholds ] .",
    "as the proton is not at all relevant for the ccqe identification in cherenkov detectors , the ratio is independent of the proton momentum detection threshold ( dashed line in left panel ) .",
    "this is very different in tracking detectors which rely on the detected proton  here the efficiency is reduced to @xmath2310% at a proton momentum threshold of 0.5 gev ( solid line in left panel ) .",
    "even at @xmath24 the efficiency does not exceed 80% because of charge - exchange processes that lead to the emission of undetected neutrons and because of secondary proton knockout that leads to multiple - proton tracks .",
    "focussing on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ccqelike_over_trueccqe_thresholds ] we find that the ccqe - like cross section increases for both detector types as @xmath25 increases . in this case",
    "even more events with pions in the final state appear as ccqe - like because these pions are below threshold and thus not detected .     on at @xmath26 gev .",

    "a fully consistent comparison is not possible . ignoring this inconsistency ,",
    "our calculation denoted with `` true '' should be the one to compare with .",
    "the agreement is perfect for energies up to 1.5 gev , and still within their error bars for higher @xmath30 .",
    "the miniboone data denoted with bullets ( lower data set ) is their result for the ratio of cc@xmath0-like to ccqe - like .",
    "as these data are not corrected for fsi within a specific monte carlo event generator , this observable is less model dependent .",
    "still , the energy reconstruction requires specific assumptions as well as the detector simulation .",
    "we find that our calculation clearly underestimates the uncorrected data .",
    "however , the perfect agreement with their corrected distribution indicates a significant difference between the pion absorption models .",
    "the underestimate of the pion / quasielastic ratio in particular at higher energies could be due to , among other possibilities , an underestimate of the pion production cross section or an overestimate of the ccqe - like cross section . both , which means for the latter the fake ccqe events , depend directly on the input at the nucleon level , i.e. , in particular on the axial form factor @xmath15 of the @xmath8 resonance ( see ref .",
