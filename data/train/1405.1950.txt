    "<S> we study networks of non - locally coupled electronic oscillators that can be described approximately by a kuramoto - like model . </S>",

    "<S> the transients display complex behaviors , including resurgence of chimera states , which are network dynamics where order and disorder coexists . </S>",

    "<S> the fast timescale of our oscillators ( on the order of @xmath0 ) allows us to study the scaling of the transient time of large networks of more than a hundred nodes , which has not yet been confirmed previously in an experiment and could potentially be important in many natural networks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the average transient time increases exponentially with the network size and can be modeled as a poisson process in experiment and simulation . </S>",
    "<S> this exponential scaling is a result of a synchronization rate that follows a power law of the phase - space volume .    </S>",
    "<S> [ multiblock footnote omitted ]    as discovered recently , the dynamical state of networks can show a surprising behavior called chimeras , where network nodes split into coexisting domains of entirely different dynamics , such as synchronized and unsynchronized dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> chimera states have possible applications to brain activity patterns , cardiac fibrillation , and social systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , chimera states have been identified theoretically as long chaotic transients towards synchrony for finite - size networks , scaling exponentially with the system size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an exponential scaling of the transient with the system size is called a supertransient in extended systems , but is not commonly known to appear in networks .    predicting the timescale for the transition to synchronization is crucial for technological applications , such as cascading failure in power grids and turbulent flows in pipes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is of great importance for biological systems , such as ecological and neural systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> transient scaling is especially important in networks because network structures dominate many natural and engineered systems @xcite , but has not yet been shown experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for networks displaying chimera states , slow characteristic timescales have previously prevented the measurement of transient scaling @xcite . even in theoretical studies , </S>",
    "<S> this scaling could only be verified in small networks of less than 45 nodes because larger networks require prohibitively long computation times @xcite .    here , </S>",
    "<S> we study the transient behavior of networks showing chimera dynamics in an experimental network of boolean phase oscillators realized with electronic logic circuits . because these nodes operate on a timescale of @xmath1 , we can study the scaling of the transient in large networks of more than a hundred nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the transient includes chimera states for about @xmath2 of the time for @xmath3 and ends in a nearly synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transient time follows a poisson process with an average transient time that increases exponentially with the network size , which is a result of the synchronization rate that follows a power law of the phase - space volume .    </S>",

    "<S> the xor logic gates generate a signal @xmath17 that approximates the phase difference between the @xmath18th oscillator ( @xmath12 ) and its @xmath6th neighbor oscillator ( @xmath19 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this signal activates one of two paths in the setup of which one has an additional constant delay . when all phase differences are zero ( @xmath20 for all @xmath6 ) , then the maximum feedback delay is selected with @xmath21 . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , the experiment implements heterogeneous wiring leading to differences in link delays @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> we study a network of boolean phase oscillators that approximately follows equations similar to the kuramoto model @xcite . large experimental networks of up to 128 non - locally coupled boolean phase oscillators show complex transient dynamics , where chimera states disappear and reappear called resurgence of chimera states , which is not yet theoretically understood . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics collapses to a synchronized state after a long transient , which can be modeled by a poisson process with an average lifetime scaling exponentially with the network size , as predicted theoretically in coupled kuramoto oscillators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of supertransient scaling in our experimental networks provides further evidence that this scaling could be a general feature of certain networks . </S>",
