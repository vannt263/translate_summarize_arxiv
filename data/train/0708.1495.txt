    "the minos experiment was designed to explore the phenomenon of @xmath2 disappearance as observed in experiments studying atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite and more recently in the k2k accelerator - based experiment  @xcite .",
    "the leading hypothesis for this phenomenon is neutrino oscillations , with @xmath11 the likely dominant oscillation mode .",
    "minos makes use of a configurable intense neutrino source ( numi ) derived from @xmath10 protons extracted from the fermilab main injector onto a graphite target , and two magnetized - iron and scintillator detectors : a @xmath12kton near detector ( nd ) located on the fermilab site approximately @xmath13 downstream of the numi target and a @xmath14kton far detector ( fd ) located in the soudan underground laboratory at a distance of @xmath15 .",
    "the numi beam line and the minos detectors are described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we reported results based on data accumulated during the first period of numi operations between may 2005 and february 2006 .",
    "we denote this period as ` run - i ' .",
    "far detector data collected with the target in the ` low - energy ' ( le ) beam configuration , corresponding to an exposure of @xmath16 protons on target ( pot ) , were analyzed in the context of two - flavor @xmath17 oscillations .",
    "oscillation parameters were obtained from a fit to the reconstructed charged - current ( cc ) @xmath2 energy spectrum : @xmath18 for the squared - mass difference and @xmath19 for the mixing angle , where only the physical region @xmath20 was considered and where the uncertainties represent approximate @xmath6 confidence level ( cl ) intervals .",
    "following the fermilab accelerator complex shutdown in spring 2006 , numi resumed operations in june 2006 .",
    "the period from then through july 2007 is referred to as ` run - ii ' . with some modifications relative to that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have carried out an analysis of the le run - i data plus the portion of the le run - ii data collected through march 2007 ( denoted as run - iia ) , corresponding to a combined exposure of @xmath1 pot . in this conference contribution , we report preliminary results on @xmath2 disappearance from this analysis of run - i and run - iia data .",
    "most aspects of the analysis follow those described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "briefly , @xmath2 cc interactions candidates are selected from events in near and far detector data samples with a reconstructed negatively charged muon .",
    "we employ the reconstructed @xmath2 energy ( @xmath21 ) spectrum from the nd sample to obtain a prediction for the corresponding spectrum at the fd in the absence of oscillations .",
    "the extrapolation of the nd spectrum to the fd accounts for the kinematic and geometrical effects that impart small ( up to @xmath22 ) differences in shape between the two spectra .",
    "we carry out a binned maximum - likelihood fit of the fd spectrum to the oscillation probability - weighted prediction , incorporating major systematic uncertainties via penalty factors .",
    "the fd data was intentionally obscured during the analysis until all selection , fitting and systematic error estimation procedures were finalized .",
    "the new analysis reported here , including updated results from the run - i data , incorporates several improvements compared to our published analysis .",
    "the most significant improvements are :    * use of an upgraded neutrino interaction simulation package  @xcite that features more accurate models of hadronization , intranuclear rescattering and deep inelastic scattering processes . the combined effect of adopting the new hadronization and intranuclear rescattering models is a downward shift in the effective absolute energy scale of the minos detectors for hadronic showers from neutrino interactions by amounts varying from approximately @xmath23 at 2  gev to @xmath24 at higher shower energies . * a new track reconstruction algorithm , which results in a @xmath25 increase in muon track reconstruction and fitting efficiency .",
    "* increased acceptance achieved by including events with reconstructed @xmath21 above @xmath26 ( corresponding to a @xmath27 expected increase in event yield ) , and by expanding the fiducial volume definition along the beam direction for the fd by @xmath28 . * improved selection of @xmath2 cc events and rejection of neutral - current ( nc ) backgrounds by use of a multivariate likelihood - based discriminant ( pid ) that includes more observables than previously used .",
    "the new selection takes advantage of correlations of the distributions of these observables with event length .",

    "[ fig : pideffpur ] .",

    "the change in the absolute shower energy scale relative to the previous analysis ( see sec .  [ s - evtsel ] ) accounts for a systematic decrease of @xmath59 for both running periods relative to the published run - i analysis .",
    "we have also carried out the run - i analysis with the new neutrino interaction and event reconstruction software , but applying the same selection criteria as used in the previous analysis so as to have a greater overlap of fd @xmath2 cc candidates , and obtain @xmath60 .",
    "we estimate the statistical significance of the deviation of this result from our published value ( after accounting for the shower energy scale change ) to be approximately two standard deviations based on the mc expectations for number of fd events lost and gained in migrating from the old to new track reconstruction codes .",
