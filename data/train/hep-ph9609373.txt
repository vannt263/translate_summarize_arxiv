    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) exists at the electroweak scale , it should be easy at the lhc to observe deviations from the standard model ( sm ) such as an excess of events with multiple jets plus missing energy @xmath0 or with like - sign dileptons @xmath1 plus @xmath0@xcite .",
    "determining susy masses is more difficult because each susy event contains two missing lightest susy particles @xmath2 , and there are not enough kinematic constraints to determine the momenta of these .",
    "this note describes two possible approaches to determining susy masses , one based on a generic global variable and the other based on constructing particular decay chains .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc are considering five points in the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) model listed in table  i below@xcite .",
    "point  4 is the comparison point extensively discussed elsewhere in these proceedings .",
    "for this point a good strategy at the lhc is to use the decays @xmath3 to determine the mass difference @xmath4@xcite . for higher masses , e.g. points  13 ,",
    "this decay is small , but @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 provide alternative starting points for detailed analysis .",
    ".sugra parameters for the five lhc points .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -10pt    the peak of the @xmath8 mass distribution , or alternatively the point at which the signal and background are equal , provides a good first estimate of the susy mass scale , which is defined to be @xmath9 ( the choice of @xmath10 as the typical squark mass is arbitrary . ) the ratio of the value @xmath8 for which @xmath11 to @xmath12 was calculated by fitting smooth curves to the signal and background and is given in table  ii .",
    "to see whether the approximate constancy of this ratio might be an accident , 100 sugra models were chosen at random with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and compared to the assumed signal , point  1 .",
    "the light higgs was assumed to be known , and all the comparison models were required to have @xmath18 .",
    "a sample of 1k events was generated for each point , and the peak of the @xmath8 distribution was found by fitting a gaussian near the peak .",
    "figure  6 shows the resulting scatter plot of @xmath12 vs. @xmath8 .",
    "the ratio is constant within about @xmath19 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "this error is conservative , since there considerable contribution to the scatter from the limited statistics and the rather crude manner in which the peak was found .",
    "for point  1 the decay chain @xmath20 , @xmath21 has a large branching ratio , as is typical if this decay is kinematically allowed .",
    "the decay @xmath21 thus provides a handle for identifying events containing @xmath22s@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the gluino is heavier than the squarks and so decays into them .",
    "the strategy for this analysis is to select events in which one squark decays via @xmath23 and the other via @xmath24 giving two @xmath25 jets and exactly two additional hard jets .",
    "isajet  7.22@xcite was used to generate a sample of 100k events for point  1 , corresponding to about @xmath26 .",
    "background samples of 250k each for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , and 5000k for qcd jets were also generated , equally divided among five @xmath30 bins .",
    "the background samples generally represent a small fraction of an lhc year .",
    "the detector response was simulated using the toy calorimeter described above .",
    "jets were found using a fixed cone algorithm with @xmath31 .",
    "the following cuts were imposed :      jets were tagged as @xmath25 s if they contained a @xmath39 hadron with @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; no other tagging inefficiency or @xmath25 mistagging was included .",
    "figure  8 shows the resulting @xmath42 mass distributions for the signal and the sum of all sm backgrounds with @xmath43 together with a gaussian plus quadratic fit to the signal . at a luminosity of @xmath44 , will have a @xmath25-jet tagging efficiency of 70% for a rejection of 100@xcite .",
    "hence , the number of events should be reduced by a factor of about two , but the mistagging background is probably small compared to the real background shown .",
    "the higgs mass peak is shifted downward somewhat ; using a larger cone , @xmath45 , gives a peak which is closer to the true mass but wider .",
    "events were then required to have exactly one @xmath42 pair with @xmath46 and exactly two additional jets with @xmath47 .",
    "the invariant mass of each jet with the @xmath48 pair was calculated . for",
    "the desired decay chain , one of these two must come from the decay of a single squark , so the smaller of them must be less than the kinematic limit for single squark decay , @xmath49 .",
    "the smaller of the two @xmath50 masses is plotted in fig .",
    "9 for the signal and for the sum of all backgrounds and shows the expected edge .",
    "the sm background shows fluctuations from the limited monte carlo statistics but seems to be small near the edge , at least for the idealized detector considered here .",
    "there is some background from the susy events above the edge , presumably from other decay modes and/or initial state radiation .",
    "point  1 also has a large combined branching ratio for one gluino to decay via @xmath51 and the other via @xmath52 giving two hard jets and two softer jets from the @xmath53 .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath54 is small for point  1 , so the contributions from @xmath55 and from @xmath56 pair production are suppressed .",
    "the same signal sample was used as in section  iii , and jets were again found using a fixed cone algorithm with @xmath31 .",
    "the combinatorial background for this decay chain is much larger than for the previous one , so harder cuts are needed :      the same @xmath25-tagging algorithm was applied to tag the third and fourth jets as not being @xmath25 jets .",
    "of course , this is not really feasible ; instead one should measure the @xmath25-jet distributions and subtract them .    the mass distribution @xmath60 of the third and fourth highest @xmath30 jets with these cuts is shown in fig .",
    "10 for the signal and the sum of all backgrounds .",
    "a peak is seen a bit below the @xmath53 mass with a fitted width surprisingly smaller than that for the @xmath61 in fig .",
    "8 , note that the @xmath53 natural width has been neglected in the simulation of the decays .",
    "the sm background is more significant here than for @xmath62 .",
    "events from this peak can be combined with another jet as was done for @xmath21 in fig .",
    "9 , providing another determination of the squark mass .",
    "figure  10 also provides a starting point for measuring @xmath53 decays separately from other sources of leptons such as gaugino decays into sleptons .",
    "point  1 has relatively light sleptons , which is generically necessary if the @xmath2 is to provide acceptable cold dark matter@xcite .",
    "hence the two - body decay @xmath63 is kinematically allowed and competes with the @xmath64 decay , producing opposite - sign , like - flavor dileptons .",
    "the largest sm background is @xmath27 . to suppress this and other sm backgrounds",
    "the following cuts were made on the same signal and sm background samples used in the two previous sections :        if @xmath74 is near its kinematic limit , then the velocity difference of the @xmath68 pair and the @xmath2 is minimized .",
    "having both leptons hard requires @xmath76 . assuming this and @xmath77 implies that the endpoint in fig .",
    "11 is equal to the @xmath2 mass .",
    "an improved estimate could be made by detailed fitting of all the kinematic distributions .",
    "events were selected with @xmath78 , and the @xmath2 momentum was calculated using this crude @xmath2 mass and @xmath79 the invariant mass @xmath80 of the @xmath68 , the highest @xmath30 jet , and the @xmath2 was then calculated and is shown in fig .  12 .",
    "a peak is seen near the light squark masses , 660@xmath81 .",
    "more study is needed , but this approach looks promising .",
