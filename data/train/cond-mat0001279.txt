    "one of the most exciting thrusts in physics focusses on understanding the properties of systems possessing many degrees of freedom .",
    "the goal is to relate such properties to the interactions among the elementary excitations .",
    "such many  body problems have been a driving force in many different subfields of physics and chemistry : condensed matter physics , nuclear physics , quantum chemistry , high energy physics , @xmath0 in condensed matter physics , the study of many  body phenomena has led to many exciting discoveries : superconductivity , quantum hall effect , kondo effect , mott transition , quantum phase transitions , fermi edge and x  ray edge singularities , @xmath0 . in most cases , such fascinating phenomena have been observed in equilibrium systems at low temperatures . in comparison ,",
    "the role of many ",
    "body effects in the _ dynamics _ of non  equilibrium many  electron systems presents a less explored frontier .",
    "ultrafast nonlinear optical spectroscopy provides unique and powerful tools for studying the dynamics of many  body correlations . in such experiments , an intense optical pulse , the pump , with duration shorter than the scattering time or the period of the elementary excitations photoexcites the system from its ground state",
    "the subsequent dynamics is then monitored by using a second pulse , the probe . by measuring the amplitude and the phase of the optical field emerging from the photoexcited sample",
    ", one can gain valuable insight into the interplay between many  body and quantum confinement effects during very short time scales . a good understanding of the role of such fundamental physics can lead to new ideas regarding the next generation of photonic and opto  electronic devices .",
    "these operate under intense excitation conditions in the technologically important tbit / sec regime and are often based on semiconductor heterostructures and novel low  dimensional structures .",
    "such considerations have spurred intense efforts in recent years aimed at understanding how to control the optical dynamics during sub  picosecond time scales ( 1 tbit / sec = ( 1 ps)@xmath1 ) . in the highly non  equilibrium femtosecond regime ,",
    "the dominant effects on the nonlinear optical dynamics come from the pauli exclusion principle ( phase space filling effects ) and the coulomb interactions among the optically  excited and fermi sea carriers .",
    "the phonons also play an important role , especially during picosecond time scales .    following their photoexcitation ,",
    "the electrons and holes undergo a number of different relaxation stages as they scatter among themselves via the coulomb interaction and with the phonons via the electron  phonon ( _ e  p _ ) interaction .",
    "below we briefly discuss each of these relaxation stages . initially (",
    "stage * i * , the _ coherent regime _ ) the photoexcited electrons and holes have a well  defined phase relationship : since the photon momentum is negligible , they are restricted to have opposite momenta .",
    "such a coherence is described by an optical polarization . in the very beginning ,",
    "the photoexcited carriers interact via the bare coulomb interaction . after time intervals of the order of the inverse plasmon frequency corresponding to the carrier density ,",
    "the interactions become screened .",
    "the problem can then be approached in terms of interacting fermi liquid quasi ",
    "particles @xcite .",
    "even though in typical metals such screening occurs within an extremely short time interval @xmath2  1 fs , in semiconductors the inverse plasma frequency is of the order of tens of femtoseconds and therefore the above regime is accessible experimentally by using @xmath2  510 fs optical pulses . if one tunes the pump frequency above the onset of linear absorption , _ real _ carriers are photoexcited , in which case the duration of stage * i * is determined by the dephasing time , @xmath3 . in metals ,",
    "the latter is typically of the order of a few femtoseconds , while in semiconductors it can be as long as a few picoseconds .",
    "the dephasing processes are suppressed if one tunes the pump frequency _ below _ the onset of linear absorption . under such below  resonance excitation conditions ,",
    "the coherent effects become dominant since only _ virtual _ carriers are photoexcited and thus _ dissipative _ scattering processes can not occur . the time  dependence of the optical polarization is then determined by the pulse duration , which leads to extremely fast nonlinearities .    immediately after the _ e ",
    "h _ phase coherence is lost , incoherent populations of electrons and holes are formed .",
    "these are initially described by _",
    "non  thermal _ density distributions .",
    "subsequently , these evolve into hot thermal distributions characterized by an electron temperature that can far exceed that of the lattice .",
    "such a time evolution ( stage * ii * ) as the carriers equilibrate among themselves is mainly induced by the _",
    "_ e  h _ , _ h  h _ , and _ e  p _ interactions . the duration of this stage * ii * is determined by the population relaxation time , @xmath4 , which can be of the order of picoseconds .",
    "subsequently , the _ e  p _ interaction leads to the equilibration of the electronic and lattice temperatures on a time scale of tens of picoseconds , followed by the return to thermodynamic equilibrium after hundreds of picoseconds via the recombination of the photoexcited carriers or via the transport of heat to the surroundings ( stage * iii * ) .",
    "a large body of experimental and theoretical work has focussed on different aspects of the above relaxation .",
    "such developments in undoped semiconductors have been extensively described in a number of excellent review articles and books . among the earlier reviews of interaction effects in highly ",
    "excited undoped semiconductors , we note those of haug and schmitt ",
    "rink @xcite , stahl and baslev @xcite , zimmermann @xcite , schmitt ",
    "@xcite , and haug and koch @xcite .",
    "more recent reviews focussing on the femtosecond _ coherent _ dynamics in undoped semiconductors include those by mukamel @xcite , binder and koch @xcite , shah @xcite , haug and jauho @xcite , axt and mukamel @xcite , and chemla @xcite .",
    "we also note the collections of papers in refs .",
    "more recently , there has been a lot of interest in using ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy to study the dynamics of many ",
    "body effects in metals .",
    "the charge carrier dynamics and the coherent ultrafast phenomena in bulk metals , metal interfaces , and metal surfaces were recently reviewed by petek and ogawa @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this review article is to provide a comprehensive picture of recent experimental and theoretical advances in understanding femtosecond many  body phenomena in _ fermi sea _ systems .",
    "as has been extensively discussed in the review articles and books listed above , even though a description of the ultrafast dynamics based on few  level models @xcite has been very successful in atomic and molecular systems , it faces serious shortcomings when applied to semiconductors and metals .",
    "the development of microscopic non  equilibrium many ",
    "body theories has been found to be necessary for describing the femtosecond dynamics and has made this field an exciting area of research in condensed matter physics . in view of the large body of work , especially in undoped semiconductors",
    ", we will concentrate here on specific aspects of the many ",
    "body physics that have not been extensively reviewed elsewhere .",
    "in particular , we will not touch on the impressive advances in undoped semiconductors and will attempt to provide a unified picture of the ultrafast dynamics in different confined fermi sea systems .",
    "we will mainly focus on coherent effects due to the coulomb interaction and will only briefly discuss the electron  phonon ( _ e  p _ ) interaction effects .",
    "the main body of this article discusses the recent breakthroughs in understanding the sub  picosecond dynamics in modulation  doped quantum wells ( mdqw s ) and metal nanoparticles , with particular emphasis on non  markovian memory effects induced by carrier",
    " carrier many  body correlations .",
    "such dynamical effects are beyond the scope of the dephasing and relaxation time approximations .",
    "one should note here that a detailed quantitative description of the experimental results presents a formidable task in the subpicosecond regime , which requires sophisticated numerical simulations as well as different approximations .",
    "this can make it difficult to discuss in a simple and intuitive way the important many  body physics conveyed by the experiment . here",
    "we will focus on the simplest possible models that can capture the most important physics associated with the non  equilibrium coulomb correlations and attempt to provide , to the degree possible , an intuitive explanation of the often delicate experimental features .",
    "let us now briefly discuss how many  body correlations enter into the ultrafast nonlinear optical response .",
    "the most commonly used theoretical approach starts with the heisenberg equations of motion of the one  particle density matrix , @xmath5 , where the indices @xmath6 label the conduction and valence band @xcite .",
    "the off  diagonal density matrix element , @xmath7 , is the optical polarization , while the diagonal matrix elements , @xmath8 , correspond to the electron and hole occupation numbers ( density distributions ) .",
    "such equations of motion must be solved to obtain the polarization , which in turn acts as the source term in the maxwell equations that determine the signal measured in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the difficulty in treating the many  body interactions comes from the coupling of the one  particle density matrix to many  particle correlation functions ( higher density matrices ) . as is typical for many  body systems , this leads to an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations which can not be solved exactly @xcite .",
    "one must therefore devise a controlled truncation scheme .",
    "one possibility is to adopt the time ",
    "dependent hartree ",
    "fock approximation ( hfa ) , which relies on the factorization of the many  particle correlation functions and only includes the two  particle interaction effects . such an approach developed into the very successful semiconductor bloch equations ( sbe s ) formalism ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , many recent experimental observations , reviewed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , could not be explained within such a mean field approach and were attributed to four  particle and higher order coulomb correlations . in order to develop a many  body theory that can capture such effects , it was noted by several different groups that , in undoped semiconductors , the above infinite density matrix hierarchy truncates if one adopts an expansion in terms of the optical fields @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the undoped semiconductor ground state , the conduction band is empty while the valence band is full .",
    "such a method for treating the coulomb correlations nonperturbatively is often referred to as the `` dynamic controlled truncation scheme '' .",
    "an alternative many ",
    "body approach has been based on diagrammatic expansions for keldysh green s functions , whose multiple  time dependence is typically eliminated by using the kadanoff ",
    "baym ansatz @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss how non  markovian memory effects enter into the density matrix equations of motion . due to the many degrees of freedom that affect the dynamics , one usually distinguishes between a subsystem interacting directly with the optical fields ( e.g. the photoexcited _ e  h _ pair ) and a reservoir / bath consisting of all the other degrees of freedom ( e.g. the phonons or the fermi sea excitations ) .",
    "the polarization equation of motion can be cast in the form @xmath9 where the first term describes the hartree ",
    "fock interactions among the coherent _ e  h _ pairs , while the second term describes the many ",
    "body scattering processes among the carriers as well as between the carriers and the bath excitations . the latter term can be expressed in the general form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a memory kernel ( similar equations can also be written for the carrier distribution functions ) .",
    "the importance of the many  body correlations of interest here is that they determine the dependence of @xmath11 on the two times @xmath12 and @xmath13 and therefore govern the memory effects . in systems where only times @xmath14 contribute to the above integral , one can apply the markovian approximation , in which case @xmath15 in many cases , one can further approximate @xmath16 by a time ",
    "independent constant , the dephasing energy width @xmath17 .",
    "for example , such an approximation allows one to include , in a semi  phenomenological way , the effect of the scattering processes in the sbe s .",
    "however , when such a markovian approximation breaks down , the many ",
    "body correlations can affect the qualitative ultrafast dynamics by inducing strong memory effects and non  exponential polarization decay .",
    "such effects in undoped semiconductors are known to arise e.g. from exciton ",
    "exciton correlations or from _ e  p _ and carrier  carrier interactions in the quantum kinetic regime and have been extensively reviewed e.g. in refs .",
    "here we focuss on analogous effects whose origin lies in the non  perturbative coulomb correlations between the photoexcited carriers and the cold electron fermi sea in mdqw s and small metal nanoparticles .",
    "this review is organized as follows .",
    "first we present an overview of the experimental results on the ultrafast nonlinear optical dynamics in mdqw s ( section [ sec : mdqw ] ) and metal nanoparticles ( section [ sec : nano ] ) . in section [ sec : formalism ]",
    "we outline the formalism necessary for describing the _ coherent _ ultrafast nonlinear optical response of fermi sea systems . in section [ sec :",
    "fes ] , the ultrafast nonlinear dynamics of the fermi edge singularity ( fes ) in the coherent regime is discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : decay ] the size - dependent dynamical screening of the coulomb interaction in metal nanoparticles is discussed and the results for the quasiparticle scattering rates are reviewed . in section [ sec :",
    "optics ] these results are used to describe the ultrafast surface plasmon ( sp ) dynamics in small noble - metal nanoparticles .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the review .",
    "by separating the ionized impurity donors from the electrons , modulation doping can produce a high mobility two  dimensional electron gas .",
    "in contrast to the case of a photoexcited electron gas , the temperature of such a system can be lowered , which enables the observation of fascinating many  body phenomena such as the quantum hall effect @xcite and the fermi edge singularity @xcite .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest in studying the ultrafast dynamics in mdqw s .",
    "the role of the interactions between the photoexcited and the fermi sea ( fs ) carriers during the thermalization stage * ii * has been reviewed e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite and is only briefly discussed here . in the section [ sec : spud ]",
    "we will review corresponding measurements in metal films and nanoparticles and compare with mdqw s .",
    "much less is known about the role of many ",
    "body effects in the _ coherent _ regime ( stage * i * ) .",
    "even though some aspects of the effects of the _ e  e _ scattering have been described within the dephasing time approximation , the role of the _ e  h _ correlations between the photoexcited holes and the fs electrons has only recently been studied .",
    "the main difficulty in treating such _",
    "correlation effects comes from the non  perturbative nature of the fermi edge singularity ( fes ) , which dominates the absorption spectrum close to the absorption onset , and which can not be described within the dephasing time approximation .",
    "important here is that the _ e  h _ interactions between a heavy photoexcited hole and the fs - electrons lead to the scattering of a macroscopic number of low  energy fs - pairs , which readjusts the entire fs into a new orthogonal scattering state in the course of the optical excitation ( anderson orthogonality catastrophe @xcite ) .",
    "before we discuss the ultrafast dynamics due to such effects , we briefly summarize in the next section the linear optical properties of mdqw s .",
    "close to the onset of linear absorption and for low  temperatures , the optical properties of mdqw s are dominated by the fes .",
    "the latter is a many  body resonance that has been observed in doped semiconductors ( see e.g @xcite ) as well as in metals @xcite , where it is referred to as the x  ray edge singularity . despite the screening of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "the strength of this resonance is comparable to that of the undoped qw excitons .",
    "the non  lorentzian lineshape of the fes can be viewed as originating from the decay of an excitonic bound state caused by its interactions with the gapless fs excitations @xcite . in the case of holes localized due to",
    "e.g. the disorder @xcite or for core holes in metals , the lineshape of the fes close to the onset of absorption can be approximately described by using the analytic power law expression @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of states , @xmath20 is the fermi energy , @xmath21 is the optical frequency measured from the fermi edge , and @xmath22 is the fes exponent , where @xmath23 is the s  wave phaseshift of the screened _ e  h _ potential @xmath24 evaluated at @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the dimensionless parameter characterizing the _ e  h _ scattering strength . such a non  lorentzian lineshape results from the competition between the mahan singularity , due to the attractive interaction between the fs and the localized hole ( vertex correction effect , @xcite ) and the anderson orthogonality catastrophe due to the readjustment of the fs density profile during the optical transition ( hole self  energy effect , @xcite ) . in the case of finite hole mass @xmath27",
    ", the fes is broadened by an additional energy width of the order of the hole recoil energy @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the electron mass @xcite .    in a first approximation ,",
    "the excitonic effects in a mdqw can be described by extending the mean field approach ( hfa ) to include the effects of the screening and the pauli blocking due to the fs @xcite .",
    "however , such a static treatment of the fs leads to a spurious bound state @xcite with respect to the fermi energy , @xmath20 , referred to in the following as the hfa bound state @xcite .",
    "this discrete state , with binding energy @xmath30 , would appear at the energy @xmath31 . obviously , for @xmath32",
    "( as in typical mdqw s ) , such a state can not exist since it overlaps with the fs continuum , with which it interacts via the _ e  h _ potential @xcite .",
    "the `` unbinding '' of this hfa bound state occurs via its interactions with the fs excitations , which are _ not _ taken into account in the hfa @xcite .",
    "note that , in two  dimensional systems , a static fs allows for bound states even for arbitrarily small attractive interactions and therefore such an unbinding can not arise from static screening or from pauli blocking effects .",
    "this spurious bound state could be artificially merged with the continuum by introducing a dephasing time comparable to its binding energy .",
    "such an approximation , however , neglects competely the dynamical correlations between the photoexcited _ e  h _ pair and the fs excitations .",
    "a microscopic description of the unbinding of the hfa bound state presents a nontrivial problem due to the non  perturbative nature of the _ e  h _ correlations between the photoexcited hole and the fs excitations @xcite . even in linear absorption , within green function techniques , this problem is rather involved because vertex correction diagrams with arbitrarily many crossed _",
    "interaction lines are as divergent as the ladder diagrams and should be treated on equal footing @xcite .",
    "to perform such a task , one must sum up at least the parquet diagrams and address the three  body correlations between the photoexcited hole and a fs excitation @xcite .",
    "therefore , alternative methods were developed for the case of linear absorption , based on fermi s golden rule with many ",
    "electron eigenstates expressed in terms of slater determinants @xcite .",
    "such approaches become exact in the limit @xmath33 and describe quite accurately the fes lineshapes observed in typical mdqw s @xcite .",
    "another approach to the fes problem is based on the coupled cluster expansion ( cce ) @xcite .",
    "this general many  body technique provided exact results in the limit @xmath33 @xcite and was used to treat the hole recoil correlations in one dimension @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "an exact solution was obtained for @xmath34 .",
    "the cce has also been used to describe the _ e  e _ correlation effects @xcite .",
    "more importantly , however , this method is well  suited for describing correlations in non  equilibrium systems , where it retains the advantages of diagrammatic expansions without resorting to the kadanoff - baym ansatz or to the markovian approximation @xcite .      in this section",
    "we summarize some recent studies of the dephasing and relaxation processes in mdqw s .",
    "the earlier work focussed on the role of the interactions between the fs and the photoexcited carriers on the thermalization during relaxation stage * ii*. in most cases , a non  thermal distribution of real electron and hole carriers was photoexcited well above the fermi surface and the subsequent incoherent population dynamics was monitored with ultrafast pump  probe spectroscopy .",
    "note that , in such experiments , the measured differential transmission is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the transmission coefficient in the probe direction in the presence of the pump field @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes the time delay between the pump and probe optical pulses . for samples with sufficiently small thickness @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is small , the differential transmission reproduces the change , @xmath41 , in the probe absorption coefficient @xmath42 which is induced by the pump photoexcitation : @xmath43 .    for a simple intuitive interpretation of the thermalization experiments in mdqw s",
    ", it is often assumed that , for free carriers photoexcited well above the onset of absorption and for time scales much longer than the dephasing time , the differential absorption spectrum maps the carrier distribution functions at the probe photon energy at time @xmath38 . in particular , the following approximation is often used : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the linear absorption coefficient and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the electron and hole distribution functions at the corresponding energies .",
    "within such an approximation , the time evolution of the differential absorption is determined by the carrier distribution functions at time @xmath38 .",
    "there have been many theoretical calculations of the distribution function time evolution , mostly based on numerical solutions of the semiclassical boltzmann equations ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a detailed review of such an approach to thermalization can be found in ref . @xcite .",
    "more recently , the dynamics in the quantum kinetic regime and the shortcomings of the boltzmann equations have been addressed , as reviewed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "knox _ et .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of the inelastic _ e  e _ scattering on the thermalization by photoexciting a non  thermal carrier distribution well above the fermi surface and then monitoring its time evolution to a thermal distribution at the bottom of the band .",
    "they observed that the _ e  e _ interactions between the photoexcited and fs electrons significantly enhance the thermalization rates as compared to undoped semiconductors .",
    "in particular , the thermalization time in mdqw s was found to be of the order of @xmath210fs .",
    "the differential transmission lineshape mimicked that of a boltzmann distribution peaked at the bottom of the conduction band , which indicates a non  degenerate carrier distribution .",
    "this is expected at room temperatures ( as in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the thermal energy exceeds the fermi energy , and at high intensities , where the photoexcited carrier density exceeds the fs density .",
    "al . _ also observed an _ instantaneous _ redshift due to the bandgap renormalization by the photoexcited carriers @xcite .",
    "however , as we discuss later , the situation changes drastically at low temperatures , where the fs electrons have a sharp fermi ",
    "dirac distribution .",
    "@xcite performed low temperature pump  probe measurements and found that , at low excitation densities , the differential transmission lineshape corresponded to a redshift of the fes due to the incoherent bandgap renormalization .",
    "importantly , they showed that such a redshift slowly builds up with time as the hot electron temperature decreases due to the cooling to the lattice temperature .",
    "this observation points out that the bandgap renormalization depends not only on the carrier density but also on the carrier distribution . at high photoexcited densities ,",
    "the heating of the electron gas becomes stronger and wang _ et .",
    "al . _ observed a bleaching of the fes due to the smearing of the sharp fermi surface .",
    "both the above experiments were interpreted in terms of _ e  e _ interactions between the photoexcited and the fs carriers .",
    "@xcite performed ultrafast luminescence measurements at low temperatures to investigate the role of the _ e  h _ interactions on the thermalization in n  type mdqw s .",
    "in particular , they measured the time evolution of the luminescence intensity at the bandgap energy , where the optically  induced perturbation of the electron distribution due to , e.g. , heating is minimal .",
    "_ found that the number of holes that thermalized to the top of the valence band as a function of time could not accounted for if one assumes a thermalized hole distribution .",
    "this result indicates that a substantial fraction of the photoexcited holes are non  thermal for time intervals as long as @xmath2 800fs .",
    "furthermore , monte ",
    "carlo simulations @xcite indicated that the _ e  h _ scattering is the dominant hole thermalization mechanism .",
    "similar measurements in n  doped bulk gaas were performed by chebira _ et .",
    "( at low temperatures ) @xcite and zhou _ et .",
    "( at room temperature ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the hole relaxation in p  doped semiconductors by photoexciting holes from the heavy  hole to the split ",
    "off valence band and then monitoring the time evolution of the inter  valence  band absorption spectrum by using femtosecond pulses in the mid  infrared region . due to the absence of conduction electrons , the dynamics is then solely determined by the _",
    "h _ and _ h  p _ scattering .",
    "they found that the inter  valence  band scattering via the emission of e.g. optical phonons occurs within a short time interval @xmath48100fs , and that subsequently the phototexcited holes slowly thermalize via _ h  h _ scattering with the hole fs within a time interval @xmath2 700fs .",
    "an important effect of the quantum confinement in qw s is the formation of discrete conduction and valence subbands .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in exploring the role of the intersubband excitations in the ultrafast dynamics , partly motivated by device applications such as the quantum cascade laser @xcite .",
    "lutgen _ et . al .",
    "@xcite performed femtosecond pump  probe measurements and showed that the intersubband nonlinear absorption is determined by both the intersubband and the intraband electron relaxation .",
    "they measured the effects of _ intersubband _ pump excitation on the nonlinear absorption due to probe  induced _ interband _ transitions from the valence to the conduction band .",
    "they observed a population relaxation that proceeds in two stages .",
    "first , the electrons photoexcited by the pump from the fermi sea in the lowest conduction subband relax back via intersubband scattering within a time interval @xmath2 1.3 ps .",
    "the latter is consistent with the intersubband relaxation times due to longitudinal optical phonon emission @xcite .",
    "this process is followed by intraband _",
    "relaxation similar to the experiments discussed above .",
    "al . _ also measured the time evolution of the nonlinear absorption spectrum due to optical transitions between the conduction subbands .",
    "they observed an intial decay of the differential transmission within a time interval @xmath2 23 ps , which they attributed to the population relaxation due to the intersubband scattering .",
    "this was followed by a slowly decaying differential transmission signal , whose time evolution depended strongly on the photoexcitation frequency ( within the linear absorption linewidth ) .",
    "the latter regime was attributed to the intraband population relaxation within the lowest subband as the carriers cool to the lattice temperature .",
    "we now come to the effect of a cold fs on the _ e  e _ scattering time .",
    "one would expect that the latter should become short as the fs density increases .",
    "this is indeed the case for low fs densities , high temperatures , or for large excess energies from the fermi surface .",
    "hawrylak _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the energy ",
    "dependent _ e  e _ scattering times by calculating the equilibrium self  energies including the effects of the electron  plasmon and _ e  p _ interactions .",
    "they predicted step  like decreases in the scattering time for electron energy above the fermi surface that exceeds the onset of plasmon and optical phonon emission .",
    "they also concluded that short  range _ e  e _ correlations ( not included in the rpa ) can significantly affect the scattering times at high energies . such fast _ e  e _ scattering of photoexcited electrons well above the fermi surface can explain for example the absence of spectral hole burning in the pump  probe spectra of mdqw s @xcite .",
    "however , the situation changes drastically for electron energies close to the fermi surface and temperatures smaller than the fermi energy . under such conditions ,",
    "the _ e  e _ scattering is in fact _ suppressed _ in the presence of a degenerate fs .",
    "indeed , a photoexcited electron lowers its energy by interacting with a fs electron while the latter scatters above the fermi surface . for electrons close to the fermi surface",
    ", the drastic reduction of the phase space available for scattering due to the pauli blocking by the fs electrons as well as the screening leads to the strong suppression of the _ e  e _ scattering @xcite .",
    "this is due to the sharp fermi ",
    "dirac distribution of the fs electrons at low temperatures .",
    "in fact , at zero temperatures , the _ e  e _ scattering time @xmath49 becomes infinite right at the fermi surface , @xmath50 @xcite . according to fermi liquid theory @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the thermal energy .",
    "note that the above result applies both to metals and mdqw s due to the similar values of @xmath53 . as the electron temperature increases , the smearing of the fermi ",
    "dirac distribution allows for the scattering of a photoexcited electron to states below @xmath20 and therefore @xmath49 decreases as compared to the zero temperature limit .",
    "even though the _ e  e _ scattering rate initially increases with electron density for low densities , it decreases at higher densities when the fs temperature is low and the fermi edge is sharp @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should expect delayed dephasing and thermalization processes as the electrons approach the fermi surface ( note that the above phase space restriction does no apply to the _ e  h _ scattering of the photoexcited hole with the fs electrons ) .",
    "the effect of a cold fs on the dephasing time of the interband optical polarization was investigated by kim _",
    "_ @xcite using transient fwm spectroscopy @xcite . in such experiments , two optical pulses separated by a time delay @xmath38",
    "propagate along two different directions , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and interfere within the sample , thus generating a nonlinear polarization . in fwm spectroscopy ,",
    "one measures the signal that emerges along the direction @xmath56 . in the case of optically ",
    "thin samples , the time  resolved fwm signal corresponds to the square of the amplitude of the nonlinear polarization along the above direction @xcite . the time  integrated fwm signal ( ti  fwm ) is given by the integral over all times of the time ",
    "resolved fwm signal and is a function of the time delay @xmath38 .",
    "to a first approximation , the fwm signal can be interpreted similar to atomic and molecular systems based on a two  level system @xcite .",
    "within such a model , in the case of homogeneous broadening , the time  resolved fwm signal is emitted immediately after the second pulse arrives and decays with a decay time @xmath57 , where @xmath3 is the dephasing time .",

    "it can be seen that , at short @xmath175 , the oscillator strength is first transferred to the exciton and then , with further increase in @xmath361 , back to the fes . at the same time , both peaks experience a blueshift , which is larger for the fes than for the exciton peak because the ac ",

    "the transient exchange of oscillator strength originates from the different nature of the fes and exciton components of the hybrid . at negative time delays , the time ",
    "evolution of the exciton is governed by its dephasing time , which is essentially determined by the homogeneous broadening @xmath298 ( in doped systems the exciton  exciton correlations do not play a significant role due to the screening ) .",
    "the pump pulse first leads to a bleaching of the exciton peak , which then recovers its strength at @xmath362 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the fes is a many  body continuum resonance , ( i ) the bleaching of the fes peak is stronger , and ( ii ) the polarization decay of the fes is determined not by @xmath298 , but by the scattering with the low  lying fs excitations .",
    "this leads to much faster dynamics , roughly determined by the inverse coulomb energy @xmath59 ( see discussion in the previous section ) .",

    "dependent increase in the effective mass ( and hence the density of states ) , which in turn increases the _ e  h _ scattering @xcite .",
    "important is , however , that , due to the subband separation and different nature of the resonances , such an increase is stronger for the fes . therefore , the effect of the pump is to reduce the excitonic enhancement of the fes peak ( coming from the resonant scattering of the photoexcited electron by the exciton level ) as compared to the linear absorption case , resulting in the oscillator strength transfer from the fes back to exciton .",

    "[ hybrid - fig](c ) where we show the spectra obtained without the fs dynamical response , i.e. , by setting @xmath363 .",

    "[ bspd - fig3](a ) ] .",

    "these examples show the important role of dynamical and non  equilibrium many  body correlations during femtosecond time scales .    more specifically , we discussed a recent theory for the ultrafast nonlinear optical response of the fes .",
    "we focussed on coherent effects , which dominate the pump  probe spectra during negative time delays and off  resonant excitation conditions .",
    "we demonstrated that the dynamical fs response leads to qualitatively different coherent dynamics of the fes as compared to the hartree  fock approximation . in the latter case ,",
    "the time evolution of the resonance bleaching is governed by the dephasing time .",

    "this results in an initial fast fes dynamics , with a response time determined by the characteristic inverse coulomb energy @xmath59 as well as an apparent resonance enhancement during negative time delays , followed by a long  time decay determined by the dephasing time .",
    "such dynamical features should be observable in ultrafast pp experiments . using a simple model",
    ", we showed that the different dynamics of the fes and hartree - fock treatment can be attributed to the non  lorentzian broadening of the hfa bound state due to its interactions with the gapless fs excitations , a process which is , of course , beyond the dephasing time approximation .",
    "in addition , we showed that the pump excitation directly affects the strength of the _ e  h _ scattering processes , which changes the frequency dependence of the resonance .",
    "the latter can be thought of as an excitation  induced dephasing effect that leads to a transient enhancement of the fes .",
    "these results indicate that ultrafast spectroscopy provides a powerful tool to study the role of correlations in the nonlinear response of a fermi liquid during time scales shorter than the dephasing times .",
    "the dynamical features discussed above can also be used as an experimental signal to probe the crossover from fes to exciton bound state ( exciton mott transition ) as a function of the fs density .",
    "the above _ e  h _ correlation effects and the fundamental differences in the dynamics between an exciton state and a fes many  body resonance can be best observed experimentally in asymmetric modulation  doped quantum wells in the case where the lowest occupied subband is in close proximity to the second unoccupied subband and",

    "h _ scattering .",
    "in such a system there is a strong redistribution of the oscillator strength between the fes and exciton peaks which is caused by the different dynamics of the fes and exciton components of the hybrid as well as by their coupling due to the _ e  h _ correlations .",
    "this originates from the dynamical fermi sea response and leads to a strong transient changes in the pp spectra .",
    "we also discussed the role of size  dependent correlations in the electron relaxation in small metal particles .",
    "we identified a new mechanism of quasiparticle scattering , mediated by collective surface excitations , which originates from the surface  induced dynamical screening of the _ e  e _ interactions .",
    "the behavior of the corresponding scattering rates with varying energy and temperature differs substantially from that in the bulk metal .",
    "we showed that the conduction electron scattering rate increases with energy , in sharp contrast to the bulk behavior , which could be observed in two  photon photoemission measurements .",
    "we also found that in noble metal particles , the resonant energy dependence of the @xmath39hole scattering rate affects strongly the differential absorption .",
    "an important aspect of the sp  mediated scattering is its strong dependence on size .",
    "our estimates show that it becomes comparable to the usual fermi  liquid scattering in nanometer  sized particles .",
    "this size regime is , in fact , intermediate between `` classical '' particles with sizes larger than 10 nm , where the bulk  like behavior dominates , and very small clusters with only dozens of atoms , where the metallic properties are completely lost .",
    "although the static properties of nanometer  sized particles are also size  dependent , the deviations from their bulk values do not change the qualitative features of the electron _",
    "dynamics_. in contrast , the size ",
    "dependent _ many  body _ effects discussed here _ do _ affect the dynamics in a significant way during time scales comparable to the relaxation times . the sp  mediated interband scattering reveals itself in the size  dependence of the transient pump  probe spectra .",
    "in particular , as the nanoparticle size decreases , the calculated time  resolved differential absorption lineshape shows a transition from an apparent redshift to a blueshift .",
    "this transition , absent in the rpa , comes from the correlations between collective surface and single  particle excitations . at the same time , near the sp resonance , these correlation leads to significant size ",
    "dependent changes in the frequency dependence of the relaxation time of the pump  probe signal .",
    "these results indicate the need for a systematic experimental studies of the size  dependence of the transient nonlinear optical response , as we approach the transition from boundary  constrained nanoparticles to molecular clusters .",
