    "the @xmath0 term also plays an important role in the direction of analytic continuation in the conversion from the minkowski space to the euclidean one in the evaluation of the feynman integrals .",
    "it is important to note that although infinitesimal the parameter @xmath14 is held fixed when the momenta @xmath23 ( without summation over @xmath24 ) go to zero .",
    "this can be seen from the mere definition or by observing that @xmath14 is held fixed when @xmath25 .",
    "but , @xmath26 is maximum so it attains the infinite limit when @xmath27 .    in conclusion in the path integral formalism",
    "one keeps @xmath14 fixed when evaluating or taking some limits of momenta .",
    "but we know another small ( infinitesimal ) parameter with similar properties . this is the infrared regulator @xmath28 for theories with infrared divergences as many of the known ones are .",
    "a typical feynman integral for a theory with infrared divergences has the expression in the minkowski space : @xmath29 where @xmath24 is a small infrared regulator .",

    ". the procedure must be performed also for @xmath32 case in which two situations are possible . if we hold @xmath14 fixed and take the limit @xmath33 the poles are located on the imaginary axes and the conversion can not be made .",
    "if we keep @xmath28 fixed and make @xmath34 the poles are located on the real axis and the rotation can not be performed .",
    "from our previous discussion one can deduce that @xmath0 and @xmath28 have similar properties from the point of view of their convergence to zero in the path integral formalism .",
    "on the other hand it is known that one can introduce a small mass as an infrared regulator or in the dimensional regularization mechanism @xcite , @xcite the infrared regulator is related to the dimension @xmath35 such that @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "thus in the end one needs two dimensions in the dimensional regularization approach : one @xmath37 in the ultraviolet and one @xmath38 in the infrared .",
    "an obvious question then appears .",
    "can we fix at least a part of the problem by introducing not two or three infinitesimal parameters but a single one with multiple functions ?",
    "if so then this parameter must be related somehow to dimensional regularization .",
    "let us consider the kinetic term of a real scalar field in the fourier space : @xmath39 we can rewrite this in spherical coordinate as : @xmath40 here @xmath41 are the angular coordinates in the @xmath42 dimensional space .",
    "we shall further assume that @xmath43 is complex .",
    "we perform the change of variables : @xmath44 where we expand in the small parameter @xmath14",
    ". we can make abstraction of the overall factors proportional to @xmath0 multiplying the kinetic term and write : @xmath45    assuming @xmath14 small ( @xmath46 ) the lagrangian in the coordinate space can as well be written as : @xmath47    it may seem that by making this expansion from the beginning one may spoil some of the nice features of dimensional regularization .",
    "the point is that the usual @xmath42 dimensional integrals are maintained in the interaction terms such that when one calculates corrections the standard @xmath42 dimensional feynman integrals appear .",
    "thus the above expansion does not alter in any way the dimensional regularization scheme but only leads to the correct form of the propagators .    since a fractional dimension real or complex still",
    "does not make sense we claim that there is no significant difference with the standard dimensional regularization formalism with the exception that the small parameter @xmath14 in the dimensional regularization is replaced with @xmath0 .",
    "this ensures the correct convergence of the gaussian integrals in the partition function and also provide the direction of analytic continuation when one makes the conversion to the euclidean space .",
    "so the standard procedure should work as well .",
    "moreover the same @xmath0 should play a role in the regularization of infrared divergences and thus work for both the infrared and ultraviolet regimes",
    ". we thus replaced three parameters by a single one that performs all the functions of the three ones .",
    "let us show how the new small parameter works . for that consider a typical feynman integral with infrared and ultraviolet divergences : @xmath48",
    "since the same @xmath14 appears in the term @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the limit @xmath51 one can include the logarithmic divergence in the first term in the r. h. s. of eq .",
    "( [ newrs3456 ] ) and thus obtain the regular divergence in the dimensional regularization scheme valid for both the infrared and ultraviolet regions .    in a more phenomenological context",

    ".    thus the identification of the @xmath0 parameter ( up to a finite scale ) with the dimensional regularization term @xmath1 can help dealing with the infrared divergences without the usual complications .",
    "we consider again a scalar field theory .",
    "the all orders propagator is given by : @xmath60 this propagator will receive an imaginary part according to the optical theorem . upon the use of the renormalization conditions @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 close to @xmath64 the propagator will become : @xmath65    then the optical theorem claims that for a narrow decay width in the vicinity of @xmath66 the propagator can be written as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the full decay width of the corresponding scalar particle .",
    "we claim that there is a direct connection between the eq .",
    "( [ op879 ] ) and the all orders formula for the propagator as resulted from eq .",
    "( [ rez4356712 ] ) : @xmath69    let us justify this .",
    "assume we compute an all order propagator in the standard approach for a scalar theory and we get the equations ( [ op8er79 ] ) and ( [ op879 ] ) .",
    "then for the same theory we work from the beginning in the euclidean space .",
    "there are no negative arguments of the logarithms and the corrections to the propagator are all real .",
    "after renormalization and the conversion to the minkowski space the propagator will have exactly the expression in eq .",
    "( [ op87459 ] ) .",
    "thus we can assume that the following relation holds : @xmath70 this relation says even more for the situation described in eq .",
    "( [ rez2121 ] ) where we retrieve the original form for the @xmath0 term as @xmath71 .",
    "moreover from the standard dimensional and cut - off regularization procedures one can write the equivalence : @xmath72    since the logarithms are not well defined we simply introduce an arbitrary scale ( which may be considered the renormalization scale ) to make the arguments dimensionless . then we just write for @xmath73 : @xmath74 here one employs the natural expression obtained in this work for the @xmath14 term as opposed to eq .",
    "( [ op87459 ] ) where @xmath0 is just the standard notation for the imaginary part of the denominator .",
    "first note that the first relation in eq .",
    "( [ re90z43567 ] ) is only approximate as may receive corrections and depends on how narrow is the decay width .",
    "second it will receive a minus sign for a gauge boson because of the inverse sign of the propagator and also a factor of @xmath75 for the fermions from applying eq .",
    "( [ four8979 ] ) to the fermion kinetic term .",
    "thus one obtains for gauge bosons and fermions :    @xmath76    we shall apply the eqs .",
    "( [ re90z43567 ] ) and ( [ re434343 ] ) to the w , z , higgs boson and the top quark of the standard model to get : @xmath77 we shall use the central values for the masses and decay widths as taken from @xcite : @xmath78 gev , @xmath79 gev ; @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 gev ; @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 gev ; @xmath84 gev , @xmath85 gev .",
    "we plot the quantities @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 as functions of the renormalization scale for a range of @xmath90 gev for m. the reason that we chose such a small interval is that only in this range of values a possible intersection of the corresponding graphs may occur .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ cy65 ] .",
    "as expected we find a region of intersection such that for a fixed m close to the mass of the higgs boson the parameter @xmath91 is in the range @xmath92 which would correspond to a cut - off scale in the range @xmath93 gev .",
    "if m is allowed to vary in the range @xmath94 gev the interval for the cut - off becomes @xmath95 gev .",
    "this results may improve if one takes into account the running of the masses with the scales .    in conclusion",
    "the @xmath0 parameter ( up to a finite scale ) can be identified with the dimensional regularization parameter @xmath1 and thus play multiple roles . on the other hand",
    "we expect that all known advantages of the dimensional regularization scheme are maintained as there is no difference in the standard procedure if the parameter @xmath14 is taken real or imaginary .",
    "in the end one can always make again @xmath14 real .",
    "however our assumption replaces three parameters by a single one and make the whole dimensional regularization approach simpler and more feasible .",
    "moreover the relation between the @xmath0 term in the lagrangian and the dimensional regularization parameter can be very fruitful in applications of the optical theorem and can give information with regard to the imaginary part of the propagator and the decay width for the case when the breit wigner formula holds .",
