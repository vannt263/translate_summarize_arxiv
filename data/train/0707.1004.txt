    "the understanding of the hydrated proton in bulk water and water - containing systems is of importance to many areas in chemistry and biology .",
    "much effort has been directed in recent years towards obtaining a better understanding of the excess proton in water and important contributions have appeared due to the advance in experimental and theoretical techniques @xcite .    the importance of the hydrated proton and the amount of work devoted to the problem contrast with the fact that the smallest system in which a proton is shared between water molecules , the protonated water dimer ( ) , is not yet completely understood , and an explanation of some important spectral signatures and an overall picture of the dynamics of the cation is lacking .",
    "accurate infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy of protonated water clusters prepared in the gas phase has become possible in recent years @xcite , opening the door to a deeper understanding of these systems and the hydrated proton in general .",
    "the protonated water dimer , , also known as zundel cation , is the smallest protonated water cluster , and has been recently object of intense study .",
    "the infrared ( ir ) spectrum of the system has been measured in the gas phase , either using multiphoton dissociation techniques @xcite or measuring the vibrational predissociation spectrum of @xmath3rg@xmath4 clusters with rg = ar , ne @xcite .",
    "the obtained spectra could not be consistently assigned in terms of fundamental frequencies and overtones of harmonic vibrational modes due to large - amplitude anharmonic displacements and couplings of the cluster .",
    "hence , more sophisticated theoretical approaches are required .",
    "several theoretical studies have been conducted over the last years in order to understand and assign the ir spectrum of the cation @xcite .",
    "the first measurement @xcite of the ir multiphoton dissociation spectrum ( irmpd ) of spanned the range between 620 and 1900 .",
    "three main absorptions were discussed and assigned , based on a previous quantum - dynamical simulation of the ir absorption spectrum on a 4d model of the hydrogen - bond ( o - h - o ) fragment @xcite .",
    "those assignments were revisited in the context of newer irmpd experiments and calculations , producing somewhat disparate results @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the ir predissociation spectrum of the cation in argon - solvate @xcite and neon- and argon - solvate @xcite conditions present spectra with a simpler structure than the multiphoton irmpd ones .",
    "it is expected that the spectrum of the @xmath3ne@xmath5 complex is close to the linear absorption spectrum of the bare cation @xcite .",
    "this spectrum features a doublet structure in the region of 1000 made of two well - defined absorptions at 928 and 1047 .",
    "this doublet structure was not fully understood until recently , although the highest - energy component had been already assigned by bowman and collaborators to the asymmetric proton - stretch fundamental ( ) @xcite .",
    "a similar argument was made by sauer and collaborators based on classical - trajectories calculations @xcite . in this respect , it is known from recent classical - dynamics simulations on accurate potential energy surfaces ( pes ) that the motion features large amplitude displacements strongly coupled to other modes of the system . the central - proton displacement",
    "would then be involved in most of the lines appearing in the ir spectrum , since this motion contributes the largest changes in the dipole moment of the cation @xcite .",
    "recent work by us assigns unambiguously the doublet for the first time @xcite , which is shown to arise from the coupling of low - frequency motions of the water molecules to the central proton motion .    in this work",
    "we undertake the simulation of the ir spectrum and dynamics of using the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) @xcite method . in doing",
    "so we do not rely on a low - dimensional model of the system , but we treat it in its full ( 15d ) dimensionality .",
    "the obtained ir spectrum is compared to recent experimental and theoretical results @xcite . the experimental ir spectrum and our results agree well in the position and relative intensities of the main spectral features , which allows us to extract meaningful conclusions regarding the dynamics of the cluster .",
    "all fundamentals and several overtones of the vibrational motion of the cation are computed and their properties analyzed .",
    "the computation of vibrational states in terms of their fully correlated wavefunctions is invaluable in the assignment of spectral lines arising from the time - dependent computation of the ir spectrum .",
    "the reported simulations are performed using curvilinear coordinates , which has been found crucial for the description of the large amplitude motions and anharmonicities featured by the cluster @xcite .",
    "a description of the derivation of the exact kinetic energy operator ( keo ) in this set of coordinates and of the representation of the potential energy surface ( pes ) are discussed in the companion paper @xcite , hereafter referred to as paper i. the quality of the pes expansion , and the properties of the ground - vibrational state of the system are also analyzed in paper i. the reference pes and dipole moment surfaces ( dms ) used are those of huang et al .",
    "@xcite , which constitute the most accurate _ ab initio _ surfaces available to date for this system .",
    "the quantum - dynamical problem is solved using the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method @xcite . for a brief description of mctdh",
    "see paper i. all the reported simulations were performed with the heidelberg mctdh package of programs @xcite .",
    "the definition of the system of curvilinear coordinates used in the description of is given in paper i. the 15 internal coordinates are briefly reintroduced here to make the discussion self - contained .",
    "these are : the distance between the centers of mass of both water molecules ( @xmath6 ) , the position of the central proton with respect to the center of mass of the water dimer ( @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9 ) , the euler angles defining the relative orientation between the two water molecules ( waggings : @xmath10 ; rockings : @xmath11 ; internal relative rotation : @xmath12 ) and the jacobi coordinates which account for the particular configuration of each water molecule ( @xmath13 ) where @xmath14 is the distance between the oxygen atom and the center of mass of the corresponding h@xmath15 fragment , @xmath16 is the h  h distance and @xmath17 is the angle between these two vectors .",

    "the ir absorption cross - section is given by @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dipole - operated initial state , i.e. , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the ground - state energy . the ir spectrum may be equivalently computed in the time - dependent picture . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : spectrum - td]c ) implicitly .",
    "the real part , @xmath29 , appears because @xmath30 holds .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum - td]c ) tells that the ir spectrum is obtained in the time - dependent picture by fourier transformation ( ft ) of the autocorrelation of the dipole - operated initial state . whether a time - dependent or a time - independent approach is more efficient depends on the problem at hand .",
    "a time - independent approach relies on the accurate computation of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , @xmath31 , which may be accomplished by iterative - diagonalization methods of the hamiltonian matrix expressed in some basis , obtaining all the eigenstates up to some desired energy , and then using eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum - ti ] ) to compute the ir spectrum .",
    "the method to obtain eigenstates of the hamiltonian within the mctdh approach is called _ improved relaxation _ @xcite and consists essentially on a time - independent multiconfiguration self consistent field ( mcscf ) computation of an eigenstate , in which both the expansion coefficients of the wavefunction and the basis of spfs ( see eq . ( 1 ) in paper i ) are optimized to self - consistency .",
    "the optimal basis of spfs varies from state to state , which difficults the application of iterative diagonalization procedures to the computation of the whole spectrum . to obtain each excited state with _ improved relaxation _ , a new computation is needed in which the basis is optimized for that specific state .",
    "a comprehensive calculation of an ir spectrum by _ improved relaxation _ has been recently achieved for 6d problems , namely h@xmath15cs @xcite , and hono @xcite .",
    "the lowest 184 states of @xmath32 symmetry of the latter molecule were calculated .",
    "the _ improved relaxation _ approach , however , is not practicable with the current computational capabilities to obtain the whole spectrum for a molecule of the size of .",
    "the iterative process of improved relaxation converges only if the space spanned by the configurations allows to separate the desired state from neighboring ones .",
    "when the density of states increases , the number of spfs necessary to ensure convergence increases as well .",
    "this makes it impossible to compute states higher in energy . for the present problem we could compute states up to about 600 .",
    "however , not only the excitation energy but also state coupling determines the feasibility of improved relaxation .",
    "for example , we could compute the second excited state of the water - water stretch by _ improved relaxation _",
    ", despite its excitation energy is .",
    "propagation of a wavepacket by mctdh , on the other hand , is always feasible .",
    "a small set of spfs makes a propagation less accurate , but not impossible .",
    "therefore , the full ir spectrum is efficiently calculated in the time - dependent representation .",
    "the resolution at which different peaks of the spectrum are resolved is given by the fourier transform ( ft ) of the damping function @xmath33 @xcite with which the autocorrelation @xmath28 is to be multiplied when performing the integral ( [ eq : spectrum - td]c ) to minimize artifacts due to the gibbs phenomenon .",
    "we choose @xmath34 and set @xmath35 for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the length of the autocorrelation function . since we make use of the @xmath38 trick , , which holds when the initial wavepacket is real and the hamiltonian symmetric",
    ", @xmath37 is twice the propagation time .",
    "the ft of @xmath33 is known @xcite and its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath39 to clearly identify two peaks 100 apart , i.e. , the doublet structure in the spectrum , one needs a resolution of @xmath40 and hence a propagation time of @xmath41 fs .",
    "time propagations have been carried out over 500 fs providing a resolution of 30 .",
    "often we make use of the filter diagonalization ( fd ) technique @xcite to analyze the autocorrelation function of the propagated wavepackets , which yields eigenenergies and spectral intensities .",
    "fd is able to provide accurate eigenenergies from shorter time propagations than the ones needed to resolve the ir spectrum .",
    "however , fd calculations are more sensitive to errors in the autocorrelation function compared to the ft method .",
    "therefore these calculations are targeted to obtain accurate energies of a single state or a small group of related states from a propagation of an appropriately prepared initial wavepacket .",
    "the dipole operator is a vector and the operator @xmath42 appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum - ti],[eq : spectrum - td ] ) is to be interpreted as the scalar product @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the polarization vector of the absorbed light .",
    "as the molecule is assumed to be randomly oriented we average over all orientations and obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the intensities obtained with the @xmath48 and @xmath49component of the dipole operator , respectively .",
    "the factor 2 appears because @xmath50 holds .",
    "the intensity @xmath51 is hence not explicitly computed .",
    "even if the computation of the ir spectrum in the time - dependent representation is feasible , a means of assigning the different lines to specific motions of the system is still required .",
    "wavefunctions of excited states converged by _ improved relaxation _",
    "@xcite contain all the possible information of that specific state .",
    "the intensity of a given excited state @xmath31 is readily obtained by computing the dipole moment @xmath52 . but even if an excited state of interest @xmath31 has been obtained it is difficult to directly inspect these mathematical objects due to their high dimensionality .",
    "moreover , for the higher excited states we do not have @xmath31 at our disposal but only an autocorrelation function providing spectral lines . in both cases",
    "we characterize the eigenstates by their overlaps with carefully chosen test states , i.e. , by the numbers @xmath53 .",
    "the following procedures are used :    * test states @xmath54 are generated * * by applying some operator @xmath55 to a previously converged eigenfunction , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a normalization constant , e.g. , @xmath58 generates a test state which in essence differs from the ground state @xmath59 by a one quantum excitation in the proton - transfer coordinate @xmath9 .",
    "* * by forming hartree products , where the spfs are obtained through diagonalization of mode - hamiltonians @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath60 are low - dimensional hamiltonians and each @xmath60 operates on the space of a group of coordinates ( see paper i for details on coordinates grouping into modes ) . rather than using single hartree products one may use linear combinations of products in order to satisfy a symmetry constraint . *",
    "the overlaps @xmath61 are then computed by * * by direct evaluation of the scalar product if @xmath31 is available . * * by fourier transform of the autocorrelation function .",

    "the absolute square of the ft of @xmath63 at energy @xmath64 must then be divided by the spectral intensities of @xmath24 to obtain @xmath61 .",
    "this is the fastest method because it does not require additional propagations .",
    "however , it is also the least accurate procedure .",

    "[ fig : dens2]b and [ fig : dens3]c ) , whereas the second largest is the proton - transfer motion . for the high - energy band",
    "the importance of these two contributions is reversed .",
    "thus , the doublet may be regarded as a fermi - resonance between two zero - order states which are characterized by ( @xmath119 , @xmath111 ) and ( @xmath120 ) excitations , respectively .",
    "the reason why the third wagging excitation plays an important role in the proton - transfer doublet is understood by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : dens2]b and [ fig : pictorial ] .",

    "when the proton oscillates between the two waters , the two conformations exchange their characters accordingly .",
    "thus , the asymmetric wagging mode ( @xmath111 , ) combines with the water - water stretch motion ( @xmath6 , ) to reach an energy close to the natural absorption - frequency of the proton transfer , making these motions coupled .",
    "the two states of the doublet transform according to the @xmath74 irreducible representation of @xmath71 .",
    "one last remark regarding the spectral region of the doublet is the small but noticeable absorption , which is appreciated both in the experimental and mctdh spectra between both peaks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : irparts ] ) .",
    "this low - intensity absorption is due to the @xmath104 rocking centered at and which belongs to the @xmath74 irreducible representation . in an analogous way to the @xmath111 wagging state , the @xmath104 rocking state presents four probability - density maxima along the rocking coordinates , each of which consists of one water aligned with the central axis while the other is in a bent conformation , and therefore will present some degree of coupling to the proton - transfer motion .",
    "the low absorption of this band , despite its proximity to the natural absorption - frequency of the proton - transfer motion , is qualitatively explained by the fact that the rocking motions do not change the hybridization properties of the water monomers and are of a lower amplitude in comparison to the wagging motions .",
    "the rocking motion hence couples more weakly to the proton - transfer motion and induces a smaller change of the dipole - moment as compared to the wagging motions .",

    "however , it must not come as a surprise that the eigenstate @xmath122 has a total squared overlap of @xmath134 with the test states containing one quanta of excitation in the proton transfer coordinate , namely @xmath135 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 . in a fashion similar to the coupling to the @xmath111 wagging motion , as the proton approaches one water molecule the equilibrium value of the angle shifts to a larger value because this water molecule acquires more character .",
    "conversely , the water molecule at a larger distance of the central proton acquires character and the angle shifts to lower values .",
    "state @xmath123 is responsible for the absorption at in the mctdh spectrum , the lowest intensity feature of the doublet centered at about 1800 .",
    "this state has the largest overlap with the @xmath126 test - state .",
    "comparison in position and intensity of this peak to the corresponding one in the experimental @xmath3ne spectrum suggests that the latest is mainly related to the ( @xmath136 ) excitation .",
    "analysis of the values in tab .",
    "[ tab : matrix ] shows that the eigenstates in the region 1400 - 1900 are characterized by the asymmetric bending and combinations of the proton - transfer fundamental and water - water - stretch fundamental and first overtone , with important couplings between them .",
    "such a coupling was already noted by bowman and collaborators by analyzing the ci coefficients of their mm / vci expansion @xcite .",
    "however , the exact nature of each band could not be disentangled , and it was concluded that this `` is indicative of large couplings among various zero - order states in this region '' .",
    "we show that , despite such couplings exist and play an important role in shaping the spectrum , the different eigenstates involved retain each its particular character ( note that the largest numbers in tab . [",
    "tab : matrix ] appear at the diagonal ) and can be assigned to well defined transitions .",
    "symmetry analysis of the oh stretchings of the water molecules within the @xmath71 group predicts four vibrational states with labels @xmath84 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the corresponding torsional splitting @xmath81 , @xmath137 and @xmath89 states .",
    "the states - labeling simplifies to @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , when adopting the @xmath72 point group , in which the internal rotation around @xmath12 is treated as unfeasible .",
    "the use of the smaller group @xmath72 is reasonable here because all the minus - states are dark in the linear ir - spectrum .",
    "the @xmath138 state corresponds to the symmetrical , _ gerade _ stretch , the @xmath139 state is the symmetrical , _ ungerade _ stretch and the @xmath140 states are the two asymmetrical stretches of _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ type .",
    "we recall that the notation _",
    "gerade_/_ungerade _ is used to indicate @xmath141 linear combinations of the motions of the two monomers , while symmetric / antisymmetric refers to the oh motions _ within _ each monomer . a symmetry analysis based on the @xmath142 point group ,",
    "the symmetry group of the absolute minimum , labels the symmetric stretches as @xmath95 and @xmath96 states and the asymmetric stretches again as @xmath95 and @xmath96 states .",
    "the harmonic analysis results ( see tab [ tab : states ] ) yield the symmetric stretches separated by less than 10 and appear at a lower energy than the asymmetric stretches .",
    "the asymmetric stretches , despite not being degenerate , are very close in energy , separated by less than 1 .",
    "exact degeneracy of the asymmetric stretches is regained as a consequence of the feasibility of the wagging - motions , leading to @xmath72 symmetry .",
    "the mctdh spectrum in the water - stretching region reveals two absorptions .",
    "the lowest energy one is related exclusively to the @xmath9 component of the dipole , while the largest energy , most intense band arises exclusively from the perpendicular component ( seen fig .",
    "[ fig : ir04000 ] ) .",
    "the lowest energy absorption is related to the symmetric , _ ungerade _ stretching , while the highest energy absorption is related to the degenerate asymmetric stretchings .",
    "the energy separation between symmetric and asymmetric stretchings is known to be of about 80 as seen from different experiments and computations @xcite , so these peaks can be resolved by a propagation of about 260 fs .",
    "the splitting between symmetric _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ stretchings is expected to be less than 10 according to harmonic results .",
    "thus , a propagation of about 2100 fs would be needed to resolve these peaks , which is unfeasible in a reasonable amount of computer time for this system . in order to resolve the symmetric",
    "stretchings two initial test - states were prepared by diagonalization of mode - operators , the symmetric _ gerade _ ( @xmath143 ) and symmetric _ ungerade _ ( @xmath144 ) stretchings .",
    "both test states were propagated and their auto- and crosscorrelation functions analyzed by means of the fd method .",
    "fd analysis yields the symmetric , in - phase stretching at , and the symmetric , out - of - phase counterpart at .",
    "propagation of a test state @xmath145 of the asymmetric , doubly degenerate stretchings yields the peak centered at .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement to the bands observed in the experimental @xmath3ne spectrum @xcite .",
    "note that the propagation of @xmath145 yields a result in better agreement to experiment than the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : irparts ] obtained by propagation of the perpendicular component of the dipole .",
    "this is due to the fact that the wavefunction obtained from application of the dipole operator to the ground state is a coherent superposition of several eigenstates that are propagated together .",
    "the more eigenstates are to be coherently propagated , the more complex is the dynamics of the wavepacket and the less accurate becomes the propagation for each individual state .",
    "for this reason , the most accurate energies ( e.g. values in table [ tab : states ] ) are obtained from either _ improved relaxation _ to the desired eigenstate , if possible , or propagation of carefully prepared wavepackets ( referred to as test states in this work ) which have as much overlap as possible with the eigenstate of interest or a group of them . as a final remark , the spectrum arising from direct excitation of the @xmath9 coordinate ( propagation of the @xmath135 test state ) yields all the peaks in the range 800 - 2000 with almost the same relative intensities than compared to the propagation of @xmath146 .",
    "however , the propagation of @xmath135 gives a completely flat spectrum in the region above 3000 .",
    "this indicates that the excitation of the stretching motions must occur locally on each water molecule and does not depend on the excitation of the central proton .",
    "moreover , the coupling of the stretching motions to the central proton is very weak , as indicated by the splitting of only 7 between _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ symmetric stretchings and indicates that the oh stretchings of are robust to the displacement of the central proton , contrary to the situation seen for wagging and bending modes . despite the excitation of the stretchings is local in each water monomer , the calculated band at corresponds to the symmetric , _ ungerade _ mode of @xmath139 symmetry , since both water molecules are oriented in opposite directions with respect to the @xmath9-direction incident field .",
    "the symmetric , _ gerade _ mode is a dark state of @xmath138 symmetry .",

    "the lowest frequency part of the spectrum , shows a strong absorption at about 100 due to the combination of the fundamental wagging - modes @xmath148 , which are @xmath89 degenerate states , and the internal - rotation state ( @xmath78 ) of @xmath81 symmetry .",
    "the resulting pair of degenerate states is of @xmath75 symmetry and therefore bright .",
    "the two absorptions at 250 and 500 are related to the combination state of the fundamental waggings and the ( @xmath80 ) state , which results in a pair of @xmath75 degenerate states and to the rocking fundamentals , also of @xmath75 symmetry , respectively .",
    "these absorptions are related to the component of the field perpendicular to the water - water axis .",
    "the spectral region at about 1000 presents a double - peak absorption which is the most characteristic feature of the spectrum .",
    "this double peak is seen to arise from the coupling of the proton - transfer motion with a combination state involving the @xmath111 wagging mode .",
    "the reduced probability density of the @xmath111 wagging mode projected onto the wagging coordinates is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens2]b .",

    "this state alone absorbs light only very weakly ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ir04000 ] ) , but the state arising from the combination of @xmath111 and the water - water stretching ( ) reaches an energy close to the natural absorption of the proton - transfer at about 1000 .",
    "the coupling between these both states explains the doublet absorption at about 1000 , which is interpreted as a fermi resonance between the combination state ( @xmath119,@xmath111 ) and the proton - transfer fundamental ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the region between 1000 and 2000 presents three main absorptions at , and .",
    "the peak with the highest intensity in this region is the peak at which corresponds to the _ ungerade _ bending motion of the water moieties .",

    "[ tab : matrix ] ) .",
    "the eigenstates absorbing at and are both described by one quantum on the proton - transfer mode plus one and two quanta excitations , respectively , on the water - water stretching mode .",
    "the nature of the two eigenstates of the doublet at 1000 and the three eigenstates between 1000 and 2000 is described by clearly defined motions ( diagonal elements in tab . [",
    "tab : matrix ] ) , e.g. the asymmetric bending .",
    "however , they constitute a set of coupled states ( non - diagonal elements in tab . [",
    "tab : matrix ] ) featuring the wagging , bending , water - water stretch and proton - transfer motions .",
    "the region above 3000 presents the direct absorptions of the oh - stretching motions starting at about 3600 .",
    "symmetry analysis of the oh - stretching motions in the @xmath72 or @xmath71 groups reveals that the symmetric _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ stretching transform according to the @xmath138 and @xmath139 representations , respectively .",
    "the _ ungerade _ , @xmath139 state absorbs at due to the @xmath9-component of the field .",
    "the _ gerade _ , @xmath138 state , which is dark , has an energy of .",
    "the small energy splitting between _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ states shows that the coupling of these motions to the central proton motion must be very weak .",
    "furthermore , our analysis also points out that the excitation of the _ ungerade _ , @xmath139 state is completely independent of the central proton excitation , and is caused by interaction of the field with the local dipole of each monomer .",
    "symmetry analysis reveals also that the asymmetric _ gerade _ and _ ungerade _ states are @xmath140 degenerate .",
    "they absorb at due to the component of the field perpendicular to the water - water axis .",
    "the fact that the cation may interconvert between several low energy barriers connecting equivalent minima had already been pointed out by wales @xcite , who showed that the correct symmetry group , because wagging and internal rotation motions are allowed , is the permutation - inversion group @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "our study shows that the symmetry analysis in @xmath71 is necessary to understand some important features of the ir linear absorption spectrum .",
    "in addition , it has been shown in paper i that already in the ground vibrational state there is non - neglible probability of crossing the internal - rotation barrier .",

    "_ @xcite and of the mode - based cluster expansion of the potential @xcite used in the quantum - dynamical simulations , but is also a clear indication that a suitable set of coordinates was selected to tackle the problem @xcite . on the other hand , it provides a validation of the measurements on the @xmath3ne cation by the predissociation technique , since this method gives access to the infrared linear - absorption regime without noticeable disturbances caused by the messenger atom .",
    "the only essential disagreement between experiment and theory is in the intensities .",
    "the intensities are not measured absolutely but , in comparison to the bright double - peak at 1000 , the structures which appear between 1400 and 2000 are too low by a factor of 3 when compared to the mctdh simulation .",
    "such a discrepancy does not occur in the spectrum of @xmath3ar @xcite , which displays a relative intensity in that region similar to the mctdh one despite an incorrect shape .",
    "therefore we conclude that more investigations are necessary to determine the origin of the discrepancy in relative intensities between experiment and theory in some regions of the spectrum .",
    "the fact that the reported simulations are successful in obtaining accurate results for a system of the dimensionality of the protonated water - dimer is to be attributed in great part to the mctdh algorithm , in which not only the expansion coefficients , but also the orbitals ( here spfs ) , are variationally optimal . for a 15-dimensional system the use of only 4 basis functions per degree of freedom represents of the order of @xmath150 configurations .",
    "the largest calculations reported here consist of about @xmath151 configurations , while already good results are obtained by using as few as @xmath152 configurations ( see tab . 3 in paper i ) .",
    "such an _ early _ convergence of the mctdh method becomes crucial as high - dimensional problems are attempted .",
    "the reported simulations constitute a new example of the ability of the mctdh method to tackle high dimensional , complex molecular systems in a rigorous manner , and they open exciting perspectives for the simulation and understanding of even more complicated systems by means of accurate , non - trivial quantum - dynamical methods .",
