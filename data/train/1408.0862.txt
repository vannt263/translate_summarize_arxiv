    "dark energy , the main constituent of a cosmic dark fluid , is considered nowadays as a key element of numerous cosmological models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "originally , the term dark energy was introduced into the scientific lexicon in order to explain the discovery of the late - time accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , there exist alternative explanations of this observational fact , for instance , in the framework of modified gravity ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite for references and details ) .",
    "this means that we need to extend our knowledge about interactions of the dark energy with matter and fields in order to say definitely whether the dark energy is the real medium with exotic properties or the accelerated expansion of the universe is the effective result of gravitational interactions with modified laws of attraction / repulsion .",
    "clearly , there are dark energy interactions of two types : the indirect and direct ones .",
    "the first channel of indirect interaction with matter and fields is realized via the global gravity field ; this channel is just visualized by the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the most known channel of direct interaction is presented by the coupling of the dark energy with dark matter , the second constituent of the dark fluid ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interactions of this type describe fine details of the cosmological expansion thus clarifying the fate of the universe ( big rip , little rip , pseudo - rip , etc . ) , solving the coincidence problem and answering the question of how many epochs of accelerated and decelerated expansion the universe history includes .",
    "there are a few mathematical schemes of the description of the coupling between the dark energy and dark matter ; for instance , in @xcite we introduced the model force linear in the four - gradient of the dark energy pressure , which acts on the dark matter particles in analogy with the classical archimedean force .",
    "the theory of direct dark energy interactions with scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , electromagnetic , and gauge fields is less elaborated at present but seems to be very promising from the point of view of cosmological and astrophysical applications .",
    "for instance , in @xcite studying the pyromagnetic , piezoelectric , and striction - type schemes of the direct interactions between the dark energy and electromagnetic field , we have found that specific unlighted epochs can appear in the universe history . in other words",
    ", one can try to find some dark energy fingerprints in the universe history , which are marked due to the coupling with electromagnetic fields .",
    "in this paper we consider the nonminimal scheme of the indirect coupling of the dark energy to the gauge field . the model with an @xmath0 symmetric gauge field",
    "is known to be indicated as the nonminimal one , if the lagrangian of the model contains the so - called cross - invariants constructed as a tensorial product of the riemann tensor , @xmath1 , and its convolutions , on the one hand , and of the yang - mills field strength tensor , @xmath2 , on the other hand ( see , e.g. , @xcite for references ) . in order to interpret the role of the dark energy in such models ,",
    "let us focus on the examples of static spherically symmetric solutions to the nonminimally extended einstein - yang - mills equations ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "when the dark energy is considered to be absent , we refer to the exact solutions describing regular nonminimal wu - yang monopoles and wormholes of a magnetic type @xcite as well as traversable nonminimal wormholes of an electric type @xcite .",
    "when the dark energy appears as the third player in the nonminimal model , we intend to focus on the search for dark energy fingerprints in the causal structure of the mentioned spherically symmetric static objects . to be more precise , in this paper , we focus on exact solutions of the nonminimally extended einstein - yang - mills model , which describe nonminimal wormholes supported by yang - mills field in the dark energy environment .",
    "let us mention that in the cosmological context the dark energy is usually considered as a spatially homogeneous substrate , the pressure and energy density of which depend on time only .",
    "the most known model of this class relates to the so - called @xmath3-representation of the dark energy , characterized by constant energy density @xmath4 and pressure @xmath5 ( several examples of wormhole solutions with the @xmath3-term can be found , e.g. , in @xcite )",
    ". however , when we deal with the dark energy influence on the throat structure of the spherically symmetric static nonminimal wormhole , it is natural to treat the dark energy as a static spatially inhomogeneous substrate , the pressure of which depends on the radial variable @xmath6 only .",
    "the corresponding approach is motivated mathematically in subsection  [ deassump ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ keyeqs ] ,",
    "we formulate the six - parameter nonminimal einstein - yang - mills - dark energy model , and represent master equations for the gauge and gravitational fields . in section  [ wys ] ,",
    "we introduce key assumptions about the equation of state of the dark energy and describe the wu - yang ansatz for the structure of the gauge field . in section",
    "[ sect ] , we present exact solutions of the wormhole type for various models of the dark energy , including the @xmath3-term - type configuration . in section  [ causal ] , we discuss in detail the causal structure of the spacetime for the @xmath3-type case . section  [ conclusion ] is devoted to discussions .",
    "we start with the action functional @xmath7,\\label{act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as usual @xmath8 is the determinant of a metric tensor @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the ricci scalar , the latin indices without parentheses run from 0 to 3 .",
    "the term @xmath11 is the lagrangian describing the dark energy .",
    "the tensor of nonminimal susceptibility @xmath12 is defined as follows : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the ricci and riemann tensors , respectively , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the phenomenological parameters describing the nonminimal coupling of the yang - mills fields with gravitation .",
    "we consider the yang - mills fields taking the values in the lie algebra of the gauge group @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the yang - mills field potential and strength , respectively , the group index @xmath22 runs from 1 to 3 .",
    "the yang - mills fields @xmath21 are connected with the potentials of the gauge field @xmath20 by the well - known formulas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath23 here @xmath24 is a covariant spacetime derivative , the symbols @xmath25 denote the real structure constants of the gauge group @xmath19 .",
    "the nonminimal susceptibility tensors @xmath12 ( [ sus ] ) contains three phenomenological parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we consider these three parameters to be independent coupling constants , and this choice is historically motivated . in the pioneer work @xcite , prasanna introduced only one phenomenological parameter in front of the riemann tensor @xmath15 in the new cross - term @xmath26 appeared in the nonminimally extended lagrangian .",
    "later , drummond and hathrell @xcite , using the one - loop corrections to qed , showed that the tensor @xmath27 possesses just the structure ( [ sus ] ) , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where the positive parameter @xmath31 is constructed by using the fine structure constant @xmath32 and the compton wavelength of the electron @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , direct calculations of drummond and hathrell have fixed attention on the fact that there are three different coupling nonminimal constants , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , which are proportional to the one nonminimal parameter @xmath34 with the dimensionality of length in square . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "a general einstein - maxwell model was studied , in the framework of which the coupling constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are considered to be independent parameters . the motivation of this idea is based on the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the traceless weyl tensor , and the standard formulas are introduced : @xmath37 ( we follow the notations from the book @xcite ) . since @xmath36 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are independent ( irreducible ) parts of the decomposition of the riemann tensor , it is reasonable to represent the nonminimal susceptibility tensor as the sum of three independent parts : @xmath40 with phenomenological constants @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . clearly , ( [ irredu ] ) converts into ( [ sus ] ) , when @xmath44 in other words , we have two equivalent irreducible decompositions of the susceptibility tensor , ( [ irredu ] ) and ( [ sus ] ) , but we prefer to use ( [ sus ] ) , keeping in mind historical motives .",
    "variation of the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to the yang - mills potential @xmath45 yields @xmath46 the tensor @xmath47 is a non - abelian analog of the excitation tensor , known in the electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the variation of the action functional ( [ act ] ) with respect to metric yields @xmath48 the effective stress - energy tensor @xmath49 can be divided into five parts : @xmath50 the first term @xmath51}{\\delta g^{ik } } \\ , , \\label{tde}\\ ] ] describes the stress - energy tensor of the dark energy . as usual , we assume that this tensor possesses timelike eigen - four - vector @xmath52 normalized by unity and denote the corresponding eigenvalue as @xmath53 , i.e. , we assume that @xmath54 the other three eigenvalues are denoted as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . the second term @xmath58 is a stress - energy tensor of the pure yang - mills field .",
    "the last three terms in ( [ tdecomp ] ) describe nonminimal contributions into the stress - energy tensor . since the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are independent coupling constants appearing in the irreducible representation of the susceptibility tensor @xmath27 ( [ sus ] ) , we decomposed this nonminimal contribution into the stress - energy tensor as a sum of three terms with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 in front of the following tensors : @xmath59 \\left[f^{(a)}_{mn}f^{mn(a ) } \\right ] , \\label{ti}\\end{aligned}\\]]@xmath60 { - } f^{ln(a ) } \\left(r_{il}f^{(a)}_{kn } + r_{kl}f^{(a)}_{in}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & { } - r^{mn}f^{(a)}_{im } f_{kn}^{(a ) } - \\frac{1}{2 } { { \\hat{d}}}^m{{\\hat{d}}}_m \\left(f^{(a)}_{in } f_{k}^ { \\ n(a)}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & { } + \\frac{1}{2}{{\\hat{d}}}_l \\left [ { { \\hat{d}}}_i \\left ( f^{(a)}_{kn}f^{ln(a ) } \\right ) + { { \\hat{d}}}_k \\left(f^{(a)}_{in}f^{ln(a ) } \\right ) \\right ] , \\label{tii}\\end{aligned}\\]]@xmath61 . \\label{tiii}\\end{aligned}\\]]we use the following rule : @xmath62 for the derivative of the arbitrary tensor defined in the group space @xcite .",
    "the bianchi identities require the total stress - energy tensor to be divergence - free , i.e. , @xmath63 . using the decomposition ( [ tdecomp])-([dq2 ] ) and the yang - mills field equations ( [ ymeq ] )",
    "one can show explicitly that this compatibility condition reduces to the requirement @xmath64 , i.e. , we deal with a separate conservation law for the dark energy .",
    "when all four eigenvalues , @xmath53 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 coincide , one obtains that @xmath65 , and the compatibility conditions yield @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath3 is a constant .",
    "in other words , the case when the dark energy can be presented in terms of cosmological constant , @xmath67 is also included into our scheme of analysis .",
    "in order to model a traversable wormhole as a bridge joining two different spacetimes , one needs to have specific `` bricks '' possessing exotic properties , which guarantee violation of the null energy condition in the wormhole throat @xcite .",
    "the history of investigations in the wormhole sector of field theory can be found in @xcite ; we attract the attention of the reader to the two episodes only . in 1973 ,",
    "ellis @xcite and , independently , bronnikov @xcite constructed wormhole solutions in the framework of the einstein theory of gravity with a scalar field , which has negatively defined kinetic energy ( _ phantom _ field in modern terminology ) .",
    "this first example can be indicated , indeed , as the exotic one from the point of view of classical field theory .",
    "the second example is connected with the work of barcell and visser @xcite , who have shown that an ordinary ( standard ) scalar field can support a wormhole structure if this scalar field is nonminimally coupled to the spacetime curvature .",
    "these two examples illustrate the typical alternative : in order to justify the wormhole existence one can either provide exotic properties of the `` bricks '' for its throat or admit that the `` bricks '' are ordinary , but they interact nonminimally with spacetime curvature .",
    "we use the second way for modeling the wormhole configurations .",
    "for instance , in @xcite one can find exact solutions for a traversable wormhole supported by an electric field nonminimally coupled to curvature . in the paper @xcite",
    ", we reconstructed the wormhole of the wu - yang type supported by su(2 ) symmetric gauge field of the magnetic type nonminimally coupled to gravity . since the model that we study now is a natural extension of that model ,",
    "let us comment briefly three key - elements of the wormhole - type solutions with a wu - yang - type gauge field nonminimally coupled to gravity in case when the interactions with dark energy are absent .",
    "first of all , from our point of view the gauge fields attract special attention in the context of wormhole modeling : on the one hand , the yang - mills field is the most known contributor into the modern high - energy physics models ; on the other hand , the yang - mills potentials form su(n ) multiplets , thus providing a versatile instrument for theoretical modeling .",
    "second , the pure yang - mills field itself is nonexotic , since it can not violate the null energy condition in the wormhole throat , and , therefore , known wormhole solutions require either an additional _ phantom _ scalar field @xcite or a surgery technique @xcite ; however , being coupled nonminimally to the spacetime curvature , the yang - mills field becomes able to organize a traversable wormhole throat ( see @xcite ) .",
    "third , the traversability of the wu - yang wormhole and the value of the radius of the throat can be the subject of tuning : depending on the relationships between the principal nonminimal coupling constant @xmath34 and the magnetic charge @xmath68 , the throat happens to be closed or opened ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the following question is of great interest : physical processes of what type could regulate the traversability of the nonminimal wu - yang wormhole ? the results of the paper @xcite show that when the charge @xmath68 grows horizons appear and the wormhole becomes nontraversable ( the cosmic gates happen to be closed ) .",
    "when the coupling constant @xmath34 increases , the cosmic gates , per contra , become opened . as it will be shown below , when we consider an additional element of the theoretical modeling , the dark energy , we obtain a new possibility for modeling the cosmic gates opening and closing .",
    "let us consider a static spherically symmetric spacetime with the metric @xmath69 here @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are functions depending on the radial coordinate @xmath6 only .",
    "since the functions , which characterize the dark energy , do not enter the master equations for the gauge field , we obtain immediately that , as in the cases of a nonminimal @xmath19 monopole @xcite and wormhole @xcite , the special ansatz ( see @xcite ) , @xmath73 gives the exact solution with the field strength tensor of the following form : @xmath74 the parameter @xmath68 is an integer and it denotes a magnetic charge .",
    "let us remind that the generators @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the position - dependent ones and are connected with the standard generators of the @xmath78 group as @xmath79they satisfy the relations @xmath80=i\\,{\\bf t}_{\\varphi } \\,,\\quad \\left[{\\bf t}_{\\theta } \\ , , { \\bf t}_{\\varphi}\\right]=i\\,{\\bf t}_{r } \\",
    ", , \\quad \\left[{\\bf t}_{\\varphi},{\\bf t}_{r}\\right]=i\\,{\\bf t}_{\\theta}\\,.\\label{des6}\\]]the system of yang - mills equations ( [ ymeq ] ) is satisfied identically for arbitrary curvature tensor and for arbitrary equation of state of the dark energy .",
    "again , this solution is effectively abelian , i.e. , by the suitable gauge transformation @xmath81 it can be converted into the product of the dirac - type potential and the gauge group generator @xmath82 .",
    "the simplest variant to introduce the dark energy is known to connect with cosmological @xmath3 term . in the de  sitter spacetime with the so - called @xmath83-representation of the metric @xmath84",
    "the dark energy pressure and energy - density scalar are constant and they can be written , respectively , in the form @xmath85 in more sophisticated models these quantities are considered to be functions of cosmological time @xmath86 , @xmath87 , nevertheless , the specific equation of state with @xmath88 remains the distinguishing feature .",
    "the de  sitter spacetime can also be described in the so - called @xmath6-representation using the equivalent metric @xmath89 which , clearly , is static and depends on the radial variable @xmath6 only .",
    "the corresponding schwarzschild - reissner - nordstrm , etc . , extensions of the model lead to the replacements @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the mass and @xmath92 is the charge of the object . studying this model and more sophisticated models",
    ", we have a possibility to interpret the contributions containing @xmath3 in terms of dark energy of the @xmath3-type .",
    "our ansatz is that one can develop this idea and consider the dark energy in the @xmath6-representation , i.e. , using the functions @xmath93 , @xmath94 satisfying the typical condition @xmath95 .    for the static spherically symmetric configuration , the two diagonal components of the effective stress - energy tensor coincide , @xmath96 .",
    "based on this fact , we assume that two of the three eigenvalues @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 of the stress - energy tensor of the dark energy also coincide , thus providing the following definitions @xmath97 in other words we can introduce longitudinal , @xmath98 , and transversal , @xmath99 pressures , prescribed to the dark energy .",
    "we assume that the dark energy equations of state are linear @xmath100 when the dark energy is considered to possess an isotropic pressure , we have to put @xmath101 .",
    "for the metric ( [ metrica ] ) , only four components of the einstein tensor @xmath102 are nonvanishing , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . in order to describe the gravity field we use the following three independent equations .",
    "first , we consider the difference of the first two equations , @xmath106 , yielding @xmath107\\nonumber\\\\ { } = \\frac{\\kappa(10q_1 + 4q_2+q_3)r'^2}{r^6}+\\frac{4\\pi(w+p_{||})}{n}. \\label{eq1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] second , we use the einstein equation @xmath108 , which gives @xmath109 third , we consider the compatibility equation @xmath110 , which can be reduced now to the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath111 the parameter @xmath112 is defined as @xmath113 .",
    "the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the variable @xmath6 .",
    "the equation ( [ eos2 ] ) can be easily resolved using equations of state ( [ eos3 ] ) ; this procedure yields @xmath114^{2 \\alpha } \\left[\\sigma^2(r ) n(r ) \\right]^{- \\gamma } , \\nonumber\\\\ \\alpha \\equiv \\frac{\\omega_{\\bot}-\\omega_{||}}{\\omega_{|| } } , \\quad \\gamma \\equiv \\frac{1+\\omega_{||}}{2 \\omega_{|| } } , \\label{eos4}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the value of the radial function @xmath72 at @xmath116 and @xmath117 is an integration constant with dimensionality of energy density .",
    "we have to stress , that the formula ( [ eos4 ] ) describes the distribution of the energy density of the dark energy for arbitrary radial function @xmath72 satisfying the condition @xmath115 .",
    "the function @xmath72 can be chosen according to physical requirements ; when we consider the wormhole - type solutions , we assume that @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the throat radius :    _ ( 1 ) _ the most known function satisfying these conditions is @xmath120 ; it is even with respect to the variable @xmath6 .",
    "we will use it below for the reconstruction of exact solutions to the master equations with constant dark energy pressure ; this radial function displays the asymptotic behavior @xmath121 .    _ ( 2 ) _ the conditions ( [ rrr ] ) are satisfied for the so - called catenary - type function @xmath122 , which is also even function and has the asymptote @xmath123 .",
    "this function satisfies the equation @xmath124 thus simplifying the equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we will use this radial function below for the case of isotropic dark energy pressure with equation of state @xmath125 .    _",
    "( 3 ) _ the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be simplified essentially , when we consider @xmath72 to satisfy the equation @xmath126 which follows from ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the corresponding solution can be presented in quadratures as @xmath129 and satisfies the conditions ( [ rrr ] ) , when @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 is arbitrary constant .",
    "when the dark energy is absent , the equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) coincide with eqs .",
    "( 25 ) , ( 27 ) of the paper @xcite , if we put @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 .",
    "let us remind that in the case of reference model we deal with one - parameter family of exact solutions describing the wormhole with the throat radius @xmath119 , when the following relationships between model parameters hold : @xmath136 in fact , the product of the nonminimal parameter @xmath16 and of the parameter @xmath137 predetermines the value of the throat radius , thus , the wormhole does not exist when @xmath138 .",
    "since the value of the metric function @xmath139 at @xmath116 can be written as @xmath140 with @xmath141 , it is clear that @xmath142 and the wormhole is traversable , when @xmath143 .",
    "when the gauge charge of the object , @xmath68 , is changing ( e.g. , due to the charge loss ) and becomes less than the critical value @xmath144 , the corresponding wormhole becomes traversable .",
    "in other words , the dimensionless parameter @xmath145 is the guiding parameter of the model . below we will refer to these results discussing new features of the model under consideration .",
    "when @xmath146 , i.e. , @xmath128 , the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) does not contain the metric function @xmath139 , and thus converts into the equation for the function @xmath70 only .",
    "direct integration gives us @xmath70 as a function of @xmath72 and its derivative as follows : @xmath147 we are interested in the analysis of regular solutions for @xmath148 .",
    "the first regularity requirement directly follows from ( [ eq1 ] ) ( supplemented by the relationship @xmath128 ) : since @xmath149 but @xmath150 , we have to put @xmath151 .",
    "this regularity requirement fixes the nonminimal parameter @xmath16 : first , it has to be positive , @xmath152 ; second , it has to be connected with the throat radius @xmath119 as @xmath153 .",
    "the second regularity requirement can be explained as follows .",
    "when the throat conditions ( [ rrr ] ) are satisfied , one obtains that @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",

    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "in this paper , we discuss new exact solutions of the wormhole type obtained in the framework the model of nonminimal coupling between the gauge field of the wu - yang type and gravity in a dark energy environment .",
    "the solutions of this model form a seven - parameter family : they depend generally on three nonminimal coupling constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( see ( [ sus ] ) ) , on two parameters @xmath297 , @xmath298 , which appear in the equation of state for the dark energy ( [ eos3 ] ) , on the charge of the gauge field @xmath68 ( see ( [ 2 ] ) ) , entering the master equations for the gravity field via the parameter @xmath215 , and on the initial value of the energy density of the dark energy @xmath117 , which can be transformed into the effective cosmological constant in some special cases . in order to visualize exact solutions by presenting the metric function @xmath148 in the explicit form and the metric function @xmath139 in quadratures , we considered various models with fixed parameters @xmath297 and @xmath298 . along this line we discussed the solutions with @xmath299 and",
    "various @xmath298 ( the model with anisotropic dark energy , see subsection  [ modelb ] ) ; the solution with @xmath300 ( analog of a string gas , see subsection  [ modelc ] ) ; the solutions with @xmath301 ( the model with effective cosmological constant @xmath302 , see subsection  [ modelb]_(i ) _ ) .    then , we extracted four- , three- , and two - parameter families of _ regular _ exact solutions from the mentioned four - parameter families by fixing the nonminimal coupling constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". in particular , when these constants are presented by equations ( [ sigma237 ] ) , the first constitutive parameter is @xmath299 and the second one , @xmath303 , is arbitrary ; we find the four - parameter family of the wormhole - type solutions with @xmath119 describing the throat radius , @xmath117 , connected with the initial value of the dark energy density ( [ eos4 ] ) , @xmath304 , and @xmath303 ( see subsection  [ modelb ] ) .",
    "when four guiding parameters of this anisotropic model , @xmath119 , @xmath117 , @xmath112 , and @xmath298 , satisfy the following inequality @xmath305 the throat of this wormhole is traversable , since the metric functions @xmath148 and @xmath139 are regular , and @xmath306 , @xmath142 .",
    "another very interesting result is obtained for the isotropic distribution of the dark energy with @xmath307 ( this equation of state is known as a `` string gas '' @xcite ) . if we assume that @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath308 , the corresponding nonminimal wormhole is characterized by the catenary - type throat profile @xmath309 , by the metric function @xmath127 and by the function @xmath139 presented explicitly by the polynomial of the fourth order of the variable @xmath310 ( see formula ( [ 198 ] ) ) .",
    "the most illustrative regular solution of this type relates to the one - parameter model in which @xmath311 and the additional requirement ( [ 99 ] ) is used in order to fix the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this solution is of the form @xmath312 it has asymptotes @xmath313 , and a finite value at the center @xmath314 .",
    "when @xmath315 , the presented function @xmath139 has no zeroes , thus , this wormhole is traversable , and it links two regions of the spacetime with constant negative spatial curvature ( or spatially open universes ) .    for the isotropic distribution of the dark energy with @xmath316 , the solution ( [ sigma21 ] ) , ( [ 2391 ] ) describes a symmetric magnetic wormhole joining two asymptotically de sitter ( or asymptotically anti de sitter ) regions with the effective cosmological constant @xmath317 .",
    "this solution belongs to the same class of exact solutions describing nonminimal wormholes , which we obtained and discussed in @xcite ( magnetic wormholes joining two asymptotically minkowski regions ) and in @xcite ( electric wormholes joining an asymptotically minkowski region and asymptotically de  sitter one ) . for this model , we considered in detail the problem of horizons , and have shown that , depending on the values of two effective guiding parameters @xmath234 and @xmath318 , the metric function @xmath139 admits four , three , two , one zeroes , or does not admit zeroes at all",
    ". correspondingly , there are two principally different wormhole configurations in the dark energy environment , which can be indicated as wormholes with traversable throats .",
    "first , the wormhole can have no horizons , and thus it is traversable in the general sense ; this is possible when @xmath319 .",
    "second , the wormhole can have two symmetric horizons , which are distant from the throat .",
    "the throat of such wormhole is traversable , and two horizons , in this sense , can be considered as the ones of a cosmological type .",
    "all other configurations have to be indicated as nontraversable .",
    "indeed , when there is one zero of the metric function @xmath139 , or there are three zeroes , one horizon is inevitably situated at @xmath116 , i.e. , it appears just in the wormhole throat .",
    "when @xmath139 has four zeroes , all four horizons are distant from the throat ; nevertheless , this configuration has to be indicated as the nontraversable wormhole , since , in addition to the pair of cosmological horizons , two distant event horizons , which close the entrance to the throat and the exit from it , appear .",
    "first , we have shown that the dark energy influence can effectively regulate the traversability of the nonminimal wu - yang wormholes : it can create the horizon just inside the throat , and it can organize two distant horizons at the entrance and exit of the throat . on the other hand , the dark energy can open the nonminimal wormhole throat for traveling from one region of the spacetime to another .",
    "for instance , when we deal with the dark energy of the @xmath3-type , we can distinguish two situations : for the case @xmath320 and @xmath321 , the wormhole is nontraversable ; when @xmath322 and @xmath319 , the entrance to the wormhole throat happens to be opened .",
    "when the dark energy pressure is not constant , using the @xmath83-representation of the model , we could try to find specific epochs in the universe history for which the cosmic gates related to fixed gauge charge @xmath68 are opened or closed ; we hope to discuss this problem in the future .",
    "second , our study allows us to view from a new perspective a situation with the number of fundamental constants .",
    "the problem can be formulated as follows : is at least one nonminimal coupling constant ( e.g. , @xmath16 ) a new constant of nature , or should all three parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , be reduced to the combinations of already - known fundamental constants ?",
    "our study gives food for thought in this relation .",
    "one can assume that the nonminimal coupling constants can be connected with parameters of the dark energy .",
    "for instance , if we assume that @xmath3 is negative ( it is typical for anti - de sitter asymptotes ) and require that the value @xmath164 of the metric function @xmath139 ( see ( [ 24955 ] ) ) is positive and does not depend on the value of the gauge charge @xmath68 , we obtain that @xmath323 and @xmath324 . in other words , the key nonminimal coupling",
    "constant is not independent and is reciprocal to the cosmological constant . clearly , this relationship is not unique , and we hope to discuss a few interesting ideas in the next work .",
