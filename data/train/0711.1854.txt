    "since the surprising discovery of the @xmath0 in 2003 @xcite , there has been a steadily growing list of new @xmath9 mesons discovered at the @xmath10 factories @xcite .",
    "these discoveries have revealed that the spectrum of @xmath9 mesons is richer than the charmonium states predicted by quark potential models .",
    "the candidates for some of the new @xmath9 mesons include charm meson molecules , tetraquark states , and charmonium hybrid states @xcite .",
    "an ideal experiment for studying some of the new @xmath9 mesons would be @xmath1 collisions at resonance .",
    "the effectiveness of resonant @xmath1 collisions for studying conventional charmonium states was demonstrated by the e760 and e835 experiments at fermilab @xcite .",
    "the `` @xmath9 mesons '' section of the review of particle physics @xcite was largely rewritten by these experiments .",
    "there will be future opportunities to study @xmath9 mesons through resonant @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the panda experiment at gsi is expected to begin taking data on @xmath1 collisions at energies in the charmonium region around 2014 @xcite .",
    "a recently proposed @xmath1 resonance experiment at fermilab could begin even earlier @xcite .",
    "the rate at which a resonance is produced in @xmath1 collisions is proportional to its partial width into @xmath1 .",
    "thus a resonant @xmath1 annihilation experiment would be useful for studying the new @xmath9 mesons provided their @xmath1 partial widths are sufficiently large . to estimate the @xmath1 partial widths of conventional charmonium states , one can take advantage of the measured @xmath1 partial widths of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the @xmath1 partial widths for most of the more exotic candidates for the new @xmath9 mesons .",
    "a weakly - bound s - wave charm meson molecule is an exception .",
    "its @xmath1 partial width is related in a simple way to the cross section near threshold for @xmath1 annihilation into the charm mesons that are its constituents .",
    "the energy dependence of that cross section near threshold is determined by the mass and width of the resonance .",
    "if the s - wave contribution to the cross section for @xmath1 annihilation into the charm mesons well above the threshold was known , a reasonable extrapolation to the threshold could be made in terms of the position and width of the resonance .",
    "cross sections for @xmath1 annihilation into pairs of charm mesons have not been measured . however at energies well above threshold , those cross sections can be estimated by scaling the measured cross sections for @xmath1 annihilation into the corresponding strange mesons . in this paper , we will use this strategy to estimate the partial width of the @xmath0 into @xmath1 .",
    "we will asume in this paper that the @xmath0 is a weakly - bound hadronic molecule whose constituents are a superposition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we first summarize the evidence for this identification .",
    "measurements of the mass of the @xmath0 by the belle , cdf , babar , and d0 collaborations @xcite , combined with a new measurement of the @xmath18 mass by the cleo collaboration @xcite , imply that the mass is extremely close to the @xmath16 threshold : @xmath19 the observation of the decay of @xmath4 into @xmath20 @xcite implies that the charge conjugation quantum number is @xmath21 .",
    "studies of the decays of @xmath4 into @xmath22 @xcite strongly favor the spin and parity @xmath23 , although @xmath24 is not excluded .",
    "the observation of decays into @xmath25 @xcite excludes @xmath26 , because the available phase space is so small .",
    "thus the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 have been determined to be @xmath27 .",
    "these quantum numbers imply that the @xmath4 has an s - wave coupling to the charm meson channel @xmath28 .",
    "the mass measurement in eq .  ( [ mx ] ) implies that it is a resonant coupling .",
    "this is sufficient to conclude that the @xmath0 is either a charm meson molecule with particle content @xmath28 or it is a virtual state of the charm mesons .",
    "the reason such an unambiguous statement can be made is that nonrelativistic systems with s - wave threshold resonances have universal properties that depend on the large scattering length of the constituents but are otherwise insensitive to their interactions at shorter distances @xcite .",
    "these universal properties have been exploited to describe the decays of @xmath4 into @xmath25 and @xmath29 @xcite , the production process @xmath30 @xcite , the line shapes of the @xmath4 @xcite , and decays of @xmath4 into @xmath12 and pions @xcite .",
    "these applications rely on factorization formulas that separate the length scale @xmath31 from all the shorter distance scales of qcd @xcite .",
    "hanhart et al .",
    "have analyzed the data from the belle and babar collaborations on the decays @xmath32 in the decay channels @xmath22 and @xmath25 and concluded that the @xmath4 must be a virtual state of charm meson @xcite . a more recent analysis that took into account consistently the effects of the @xmath33 width concluded that a charm meson molecule was preferred by the data ,",
    "although a virtual state could not be excluded @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we exploit the identification of the @xmath0 as a weakly - bound charm meson molecule to give an order - of - magnitude estimate of its partial width into @xmath1 . in section  [ sec : hi - energy ] , we estimate the cross section for @xmath34 well above the threshold by scaling measured cross sections for @xmath6 . in section  [ sec :",
    "threshold ] , we extrapolate the cross sections for @xmath34 to the threshold under the assumption that there is an s - wave threshold resonance in the @xmath7 channel . in section  [ sec : width ] , we deduce the partial width for @xmath4 into @xmath1 from the extrapolated cross section for @xmath35 .",
    "we discuss the results in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "given that @xmath0 is a weakly - bound s - wave hadronic molecule composed of @xmath2 or @xmath3 , its partial width into @xmath1 is proportional to the cross section for @xmath5 near the @xmath2 threshold . in this section , we estimate that cross section at energies well above the threshold by scaling the measured cross section for @xmath6 .    at the quark level ,",
    "the process @xmath34 is @xmath37 .",
    "this process can proceed through the short - distance annihilation process @xmath38 followed by a long - distance process in which the remaining constituents @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bind to the @xmath43 and @xmath44 to form the charm mesons .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 carry only a small fraction of the momenta of the outgoing charm mesons .",
    "this process can proceed most easily via the feynman process in which the @xmath40 and @xmath39 that do not annihilate carry only a small fraction of the momenta of the colliding @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "the momenta transfered to the @xmath40 and to the @xmath39 are therefore small .",
    "we assume that the cross section for this process can be factored into the rate for the short - distance annihilation process @xmath38 and a long - distance probability factor associated with the @xmath40 and @xmath39 that do not annihilate .",
    "we first consider the short - distance factor .",
    "the short - distance process involves the annihilation of @xmath45 into two virtual gluons which then create a @xmath9 pair .",
    "since it involves 6 external partons , the dimensional counting rules for this process imply that its rate scales with the center - of - mass energy @xmath46 like @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted with the rate for @xmath1 annihilation at resonance into charmonium . in this case , the short - distance process is @xmath48 .",
    "the dimensional counting rules imply that its rate scales like @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the charmonium mass @xcite . in the case of @xmath34 ,",
    "the rate for the short - distance subprocess scales with two fewer powers of the center - of - mass energy , because one of the three quarks in the proton is not required to annihilate .",
    "we now consider the long - distance factor .",
    "this factor is the probability for the surviving @xmath40 and @xmath39 from the colliding @xmath42 and @xmath41 to become constituents of the outgoing charm mesons . in the initial state , the @xmath51 and the @xmath52 that annihilate act as light - like colored sources for the remaining low - momentum @xmath40 and @xmath39 . in the final state , the @xmath43 and @xmath44 act as colored sources for the low - momentum @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in the @xmath1 rest frame , these sources have equal and opposite velocities @xmath53^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the effect of the short - distance process is to suddenly replace the light - like colored sources @xmath51 and @xmath52 by colored sources @xmath43 and @xmath44 with equal and opposite velocities @xmath54 .",
    "the long - distance factor @xmath55 is the square of the amplitude for the low - momentum @xmath40 and @xmath39 to evolve from constituents of the @xmath42 and @xmath41 into constituents of the @xmath56 and @xmath33 after the sudden change in color sources .",
    "the long - distance factor @xmath55 depends on the velocity @xmath54 of the colored sources in the final state , but it does not depend on the flavor of the particles that serve as the colored sources",
    ". the amplitude would be the same if the charm quarks @xmath43 and @xmath44 were replaced by strange quarks @xmath57 and @xmath58 with the same velocities @xmath54 .",
    "thus the rate for producing the charm mesons @xmath59 , whose quark content is @xmath60 , can be related to the rate for producing strange mesons @xmath61 , whose quark content is @xmath62 .",
    "if we take into account the masses of the mesons , a @xmath63 pair with center - of - mass energy @xmath64 has the same relative velocity @xmath65 in the center - of - mass frame as a @xmath16 pair with center - of - mass energy @xmath66 if the center - of - mass energies satisfy @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
