    "the understanding of magnetic field generation , usually referred to as the dynamo effect , in planets , stars , galaxies , and other astrophysical objects remains one of the major challenges in turbulence research .",

    "dynamo has also been observed recently in laboratory experiments  @xcite that have made the whole field very exciting .",
    "numerical simulations  @xcite also give access to many useful insights into the physics of dynamo .",
    "however , the complete understanding of the dynamo mechanisms has not yet emerged .",
    "the two most important nondimensional parameters for the dynamo studies are the reynolds number @xmath0 and the magnetic prandtl number @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the large - scale velocity and the large length - scale of the system respectively , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the kinematic viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity of the fluid .",
    "another nondimensional parameter used in this field is the magnetic reynolds number @xmath6 , defined as @xmath7 .",
    "clearly @xmath8 , hence only two among the above three parameters are independent .",
    "note that galaxies , clusters , and the interstellar medium have large @xmath9 , while stars , planets , and liquid sodium and mercury ( fluids used in laboratory experiments ) have small @xmath9 @xcite .    in a typical simulation ,",
    "the magnetofluid is forced and the dynamo transition is considered to be observed when a nonzero magnetic field is sustained in the steady - state laminar solution or in the statistically stationary turbulent solution , depending on the regime . typically , dynamos occur for forcing amplitudes beyond a critical value which also defines the critical reynolds number @xmath10 and the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 .",
    "one of the objectives of both the numerical simulations and the experiments  @xcite is the determination of this critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 .",
    "it has been found that @xmath11 depends on both the type of forcing and the prandtl number ( or reynolds number ) , yet the range of @xmath11 observed in the numerical simulations is from 10 to 500 for a wide range of @xmath9 ( from @xmath12 to 2500 ) .    in recent magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd )",

    "fluids with small prandtl number @xmath9 ( @xmath14 , numerical simulations  @xcite indicate that the dynamo can be produced using forcings having local helicity ( the net helicity of the force could still be zero ) .",

    "for this regime , schekochihin et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the growth rate of the magnetic field is higher in the small scales because stretching is faster at these scales .",
    "this kind of magnetic field excitation is referred to as _ small - scale turbulent dynamo_. for low @xmath9 stepanov and plunian @xcite argue for similar growth mechanism .",
    "their results are based on shell model calculations .",

    "@xcite however are not conclusive in this regard .",
    "the main arguments supporting these explanations are based on the inertial range ( small - scales ) properties of turbulence  @xcite . in this paper , we present an alternate viewpoint . we show that a low - dimensional dynamical system containing only large scales properties of the fields , three velocity and three magnetic fourier modes , is able to reproduce some of the above numerical results . for certain types of forcing of velocity , a dynamo transition is observed for @xmath15 .",
    "these observations indicate that the large - scale eddies may also be responsible for the dynamo excitation , and several important properties can be derived from the dynamics of large - scale modes .",
    "these observations are consistent with earlier results of mhd turbulence indicating that the large - scale velocity field provides a significant fraction of the energy ( around 40% ) contained in the large - scale magnetic field @xcite .",

    ", it is interesting to study how the conservation of the ideal quadratic invariants of the navier - stokes and mhd equations can be expressed in terms of the variables \\{@xmath43 , @xmath44}. the conservation of the kinetic energy @xmath53 by the navier - stokes equations is a direct consequence of @xmath54 because this equality holds for any velocity , it is also true for @xmath55 and , in the absence of magnetic field , the nonlinear terms in the system of equations  ( [ eq : w101]-[eq : b112 ] ) conserve the kinetic energy @xmath56 associated to @xmath55 .",
    "the cross helicity @xmath57 and the total energy , the sum of the kinetic energy @xmath58 and the magnetic energy @xmath59 , are conserved by the nonlinear terms for the same reason . however , the conservation of the kinetic helicity @xmath60 by the navier - stokes equations and the conservation the magnetic helicity @xmath61 by the mhd equations , where @xmath62 is the vorticity and @xmath63 is the vector potential ( @xmath64 ) have no equivalent in the system  ( [ eq : w101]-[eq : b112 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the conservation of the kinetic helicity is a consequence of @xmath65 however , both the nonlinear term and the vorticity are not fully captured in @xmath21 , even when computed from @xmath55 : @xmath66&\\not=\\mathbf{n}(\\mathbf{u}^ < , \\mathbf{u}^<)\\,,\\\\ p[\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{u}^<]&\\not=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{u}^<\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence , the kinetic helicity carried on by @xmath55 is not conserved by the nonlinear term in the low - dimensional model and , for the same reason , the magnetic helicity is not conserved either .",
    "for instance , the non - conservation of the kinetic helicity by the low - dimensional model can be expressed as , @xmath67 and the right hand side in this relation in not represented in the equations  ( [ eq : w101]-[eq : b112 ] ) . in the following section we will solve the truncated mhd equations  ( [ eq : w101]-[eq : b112 ] ) under special cases .",
    "despite its simplicity , the complete analysis of the system of equations  ( [ eq : w101]-[eq : b112 ] ) is quite difficult . indeed",
    ", the simple search for the fixed points leads to very intricate algebraic equations .",
    "we have thus focused our analysis on two limit cases corresponding to strictly nonhelical equations ( @xmath26 ) and the case @xmath68 , both of which can be treated analytically .",
    "the system of equations  ( [ eq : w101]-[eq : b112 ] ) is thus first considered for @xmath26 . in that case",
    "the kinetic helicity captured in subspace @xmath21 vanishes ( @xmath69 ) . in this first model ,",
    "the forcing is chosen to be @xmath70 where @xmath71 .",

    "the above solutions cover the entire @xmath87 parameter space .",
    "the system converges to one of these states depending on the parameter values irrespective of its initial conditions , and the system is neither oscillatory nor chaotic . clearly , the amplitude of @xmath88 and @xmath89 close to the dynamo threshold increases as @xmath90 .",

    ", such a quantitative agreement may very well be fortuitous . nevertheless , it is also interesting to notice that , in our model , @xmath92 decreases for increasing prandtl numbers .",
    "hence , it is easier to excite nonhelical dynamo for larger @xmath9 or more conductive magnetofluid .",
    "this feature of our model is also in agreement with recent numerical simulations  @xcite where an increase of the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath11 is reported for smaller values of @xmath9 .",
    "it is also interesting to express the above results in terms of the reynolds number instead of the forcing amplitude .",
    "a reynolds number can be build by defining the large scale velocity as @xmath93 . based on this velocity scale ,",
    "the kinetic reynolds number is given by : @xmath94 for large @xmath95 , the amplitude of the magnetic field is proportional to the kinetic reynolds number : @xmath96 this result is consistent with the result obtained by monchaux et al .  @xcite .",

    "note that @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the @xmath101 curve is a hyperbola for @xmath102 since dynamo exists for @xmath79 .    to gain further insights into the dynamo mechanism",
    "we have investigated the energy exchanges among the modes of the model .",
    "the fluid modes @xmath103 and @xmath104 gain energy from the forcing @xmath105 and give energy to the mode @xmath106 . the magnetic modes @xmath88 and @xmath89 gain energy from the mode @xmath106 .",
    "the net energy transfer to the mode @xmath107 through nonlinear interaction vanishes .",
    "consequently the mode @xmath107 goes to zero due to dissipation . the @xmath88 and @xmath89 modes also lose energy due to dissipation .",
    "the energy balances for these modes reveal interesting feature of dynamo transition . at the steady - state ,",
    "the energy input in the mode @xmath88 due to nonlinearity ( @xmath108 ) matches the joule dissipation ( @xmath109 ) [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : b101 ] ) ] . for @xmath110 ,",
    "the value of @xmath106 is less than @xmath111 , hence @xmath112 asymptotically , thus shutting down the dynamo . for @xmath113 , @xmath114 , thus the energy input to the mode @xmath88 exactly matches with the joule dissipation",
    "this is the reason why @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants asymptotically in the mhd regime .",
    "we also studied a variant of the above model in which @xmath115 and @xmath116 . for this model ,",
    "the only solution is @xmath117 with all the other variables being zero .",
    "hence this model does not exhibit dynamo . in the next subsection",
    "we will discuss another low - dimensional model that contains helicity .      in this second version of the model , the value",
    "@xmath68 has been chosen .",
    "the helicity captured in the subspace @xmath21 is then given by : @xmath118 if we restrict again the forcing to the large - scale modes ( @xmath73 ) , the amount of helicity carried on by the velocity field is expected to increase , at least in absolute value , if the forcing act differently on the modes @xmath48 and @xmath119 .",
    "we have chosen the extreme case for which the forcing acts only on @xmath104 ( @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) : @xmath122 where again @xmath71 .",
    "for these parameters , a unique fluid stationary solution and two stationary mhd solutions are found : @xmath123 all these solution obviously carry a non - zero resolved helicity as defined by  ( [ eq : helicity_formula ] ) .",
    "the fluid solution is stable for @xmath124 , while the mhd solutions are stable for @xmath125 .",
    "the plot of the critical force @xmath126 vs. @xmath9 for helical model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pm_vs_fcb ] .",
    "note that the helical model exhibits dynamo for all @xmath9 as long as @xmath125 . also , the critical forcing for the helical model is lower than the corresponding value for the nonhelical model .",
    "hence it is easier to excite helical dynamo compared to the nonhelical dynamo consistent with recent numerical simulations @xcite .     as a function of @xmath9 for the helical model .",
    "the dashed lines reproduce the stability regions of the non - helical model . ]    here again , the reynolds number based on the large scale velocity @xmath127 can be defined and yields : @xmath128 and the magnetic reynolds number for mhd case is @xmath129 , a constant .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : helicity_formula ] ) we can compute the resolved kinetic helicity @xmath130 and current helicity @xmath131 defined as @xmath132 pouquet et al .",
    "@xcite , and chou @xcite conjectured the alpha parameter of dynamo to be of the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the velocity de - correlation time . clearly @xmath135 is optimal if @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "similar features are observed in flux calculation of verma @xcite .",
    "these conditions are satisfied in the helical model indicating a certain internal consistency with the results of pouquet et al .",
    "@xcite , and chou @xcite .",
    "the energy exchange calculation of the helical model reveals that the magnetic modes @xmath88 and @xmath107 receive energy from the velocity mode @xmath104 ; the rate of energy transfer is proportional to @xmath138 that matches exactly with the joule dissipation rate . since @xmath139 for all @xmath9 , the rate of energy transfer @xmath138 matches with joule dissipation rate ( @xmath140 ) , and the dynamo is possible for all @xmath9 in case of helical model .",
    "in contrast , in nonhelical model the corresponding velocity mode @xmath106 varies as @xmath141 for @xmath79 , but saturates at @xmath142 for @xmath84 , hence the energy transfer can not match the joule dissipation rate for @xmath84 for nonhelical model thus shutting off the dynamo for @xmath84 .",
    "this is one of the main difference in helical and nonhelical models .",
    "also note that as discussed at the end of the previous subsection , the nonhelical model with the forcing @xmath143 does not exhibit dynamo for any parameter .",
    "in this paper , a class of low - dimensional models that exhibit dynamo transition is derived .",
    "these models depend on several parameters such as the prandtl number , the forcing amplitude and a parameter , @xmath25 , that characterizes the ability of the velocity modes to carry kinetic helicity .",
    "the fixed points of two simple models corresponding to @xmath26 and @xmath68 are studied in details .",
    "the first model is nonhelical ( zero kinetic and current helicity ) and is compatible with a stationary nonzero magnetic solution only for @xmath79 .",
    "the second model has nonzero kinetic and current helicities , and it has nonzero stationary magnetic solution for all @xmath9 .",
    "these findings confirm the idea that both kinetic and current helicities may play an important role in the dynamo transition , especially in helical model for @xmath84 .",
    "these two values of @xmath25 correspond to the only values for which one of the nonlinear coupling in the low dimensional model vanishes . with the specific choice of the forcing proposed in the previous section , these models have then exact and tractable solutions .",
    "arbitrary values of @xmath25 would lead to much more complex systems .",
    "obviously , the models presented here are only a small subset of many possible mhd models that could exhibit dynamo . for instance , rikitake  @xcite constructed a dynamo model consisting of two - coupled disks that shows field reversal .",
    "nozires @xcite proposed a model involving one velocity and two magnetic field variables .",
    "these two models are phenomenological .",
    "recently , donner et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a truncation of the mhd equations along the same lines as our model , but derived a much more complex system of equations for 152 modes .",
    "donner et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the dynamical evolution of these modes for @xmath144 and observed steady - state and chaos in their system .",
    "the main advantage of our model is that it allows a complete analytical treatment .",
    "the six variables of our model are only representative of the large - scale modes of the system , while a realistic description of a turbulent system exhibiting dynamo should have a large number of modes .",
    "although the small scale variables are often quite important in turbulent flow , in some cases the large scale variables may determine some of the flow properties .",
    "the surprising success of the very simple models proposed here in reproducing several feature of the dynamo transition could suggest that we are in such a situation .",
    "schekochihin et al .",
    "@xcite , stepanov and plunian @xcite , and iskakov et al .",
    "@xcite have highlighted the role played by inertial range eddies that are absent in our low - dimensional models . yet in the absence of a definite theory of dynamo , it is interesting to show that low - dimensional models that focus on the dynamics of the large scale flows may also be successful .",
