    "the cosmic x - ray ( xrb ) and infrared ( cirb ) backgrounds are now well established cosmological components , including a substantial fraction of the integrated emissions by galaxies and agns over the hubble time . while it is common wisdom that the xrb is largely due to past activity of agns with spectral properties determined by a wide range of column densities for the line - of - sight absorbing gas ( e.g. setti & woltjer 1989 ; madau et al .",
    "1994 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ) , the sources of the cirb are less understood at present ( genzel & cesarsky 2000 ) .",
    "although so far apart in photon energies , an important relationship has been suggested to hold between these two components . the x - ray emission which is photoelectrically absorbed in type - ii agns dominating the xrb is expected to be down - graded in energy by the dusty circum - nuclear medium and to emerge thermally re - processed in the ir between a few and few hundreds @xmath3 m ( efstathiou and rowan - robinson 1995 ; granato , danese , franceschini 1997 ) .",
    "it has been even considered that , under rather extreme assumptions about the ir emissivity of type - ii objects and the fraction of compton - thick sources , half or so of the cirb itself might be due to dust - reprocessed quasar emission ( almaini , lawrence , and boyle 1999 ; fabian and iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "if true , then both the xrb and partly also the cirb would be manifestations of the same phenomenon of gas accretion in strong gravitational fields .    this simple , time - honored scheme for the origin of the hard xrb turned out difficult to prove , however . while classical type - i quasars are easily detected in optical or soft x - rays at any @xmath5",
    ", the putative type - ii source population has remained elusive for long time , confined by photoelectric absorption and dust extinction into poorly sampled spectral domains  the hard x - rays and the mid- and far - ir .",
    "tests of the type - ii population have been attempted , in particular , by correlating deep x - ray maps and catalogues of faint millimetric sources ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2000 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2001 ; barger et al .",
    "in general , however , x - ray sources are not detected in the millimeter , probably because of the lack of cold dust in these objects ( the agn heats the circum - nuclear medium to temperatures too high to be observable at such long wavelengths even in high redshift sources ) .",
    "new powerful instrumentation from space is eventually providing opportunities for direct tests of the standard synthesis model of the xrb and its obscured accretion paradigm .",
    "more than 80% of the xrb in the 2 - 8 kev band has been resolved into sources with very long exposures by chandra in the hdfn ( brandt et al .",
    "2001 ) and the chandra deep field south ( giacconi et al .",
    "xmm has resolved @xmath6 of the xrb in the harder band between 5 and 10 kev ( hasinger et al .",
    "for the first time representative samples of the sources of xrb are available for detailed physical inspection .    on the ir side ,",
    "iso has produced deep diffraction - limited imaging between 12 and 18 @xmath3 m ( isocam - lw3 ) , allowing the detection of hot dust emission by sources at large redshifts .",
    "iso and _ chandra _ observations in a small field of the lensing cluster abell 2390 have been discussed by wilman , fabian and gandhi ( 2000 ) , with two sources found in common .",

    "sources in the hdf north with faint lw3 counterparts are reported in alexander et al .",
    "these x - ray / ir objects are quite faint and red in the optical , and lack spectroscopic redshifts ( for one object cowie et al .",
    "2001 estimate z=1.47 from optical spectroscopy ) .",
    "wilman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) point out that the bright mid - ir flux from two of these sources might be consistent with that expected from a circum - nuclear dust torus .",
    "though exploiting the deepest ir and x - ray data available , these results are limited by the very small area of few tens square arcminutes in total .",
    "we discuss in this paper the properties of a substantial population of extremely red galaxies as counterparts of faint hard x - ray and ir sources , based on combined deep observations by iso and xmm of a 220 square arcminutes field in the lockman hole by fadda et al .",
    "we exploit , in particular , their remarkable finding that a large fraction ( 63% ) of the faint 5 - 10 kev xmm sources have relatively bright counterparts at 15 @xmath3 m , already a hint that the ir detects in these sources the reprocessed energy absorbed in x - rays .",

    "the iso observations of the lockman hole have been performed in the isocam gt program with the lw3 filter ( 12 - 18 @xmath3 m ) for a total of 60 ksec and with isocam - lw2 ( 5 - 8.5 @xmath3 m ) for 70 ksec .",

    "( 2001 , their table 4 ) .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are available for all 24 hdfn sources but two , while only 11 of the lockman objects have spectroscopic measurements ( mostly type - i quasars ; we operatively define a type - i object as having either blue optical colors or broad - line emission in optical spectra ; type - ii objects are the complementary population ) . for the remaining objects we estimated photometric redshifts with a tool based on the pegase spectral synthesis code ( fioc and rocca - volmerange 1997 ) . this allowed a large database of galaxy spectra to be synthesized , including effects of dust extinction .",
    "the tool has been trained on samples of iso galaxies in the hdf south with excellent results ( franceschini et al . in preparation ) . for the typical seds of our sample objects , these estimates turned out to be rather insensitive to the amount of extinction .",
    "a comparison of our photometric estimates with keck spectra obtained for three lockman galaxies ( obtained as in lehmann et al .",
    "2001 , and private communication ) revealed the reliability of the procedure ( errors @xmath20 , consistent with what found in hdf south ) .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] is a plot of the x - ray luminosities versus v - k colours in the broad 0.5 - 10 kev band for the combined hdfn and lockman samples .",
    "evidently , the two cover different domains of the parameter space : the much fainter hdfn data allow detection of low - luminosity emissions in moderate redshifts galaxies , part of which ( those with @xmath21 erg / s ) should be attributed to stellar processes . only in lockman the survey area is large enough to include a sizeable number of high - luminosity sources .",
    "the v - k colours for the combined sample are very widely spread between v - k@xmath22 and 7 .",
    "objects classified as type - i qsos based on existing optical spectra ( open squares ) have blue colours ( v - k@xmath23 ) and high luminosities . instead , the bulk of the newly discovered xmm sources ( previously undetected in the ultra - deep rosat image of the field ) have very red optical seds ( v - k@xmath24 , filled squares in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows a clear relationship between optical r - k colours and the x - ray hardness ratios ( hr ) : while the blue type - i objects have hr values consistent with standard x - ray photon indices @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , _ the red sources display a wide range of hr values , including very hard x - ray spectra_. other _ chandra _ deep surveys have found similarly red , optically normal , galaxies hosting hard x - ray sources ( mushotzky et al .",

    "the important point illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is that all the red iso / xmm sources detected in lockman have x - ray luminosities ( l@xmath28 erg / s ) high enough to be classified as agns or quasars , rather than starbursts . for comparison , none of the classical local starbursts ( from m82 to arp 220 )",
    "approach these luminosity regimes , all those exceeding it host an agn ( fadda et al . 2001 ) .",
    "assuming that an agn dominates the x - ray production , mushotsky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and fiore et al .",
    "( 2000 ) propose the following three different interpretations for the red population . _",
    "( a ) _ agns hosting optically silent advection- or convection - dominated accretion flows ( ball et al .",
    "2001 , di matteo et al .",
    "_ ( b ) _ a kind of red bl lac objects . _",
    "( c ) _ heavily obscured agns .",
    "the last hypothesis , in particular , constitutes the basic assumption of standard models of the xrb ( see sect.1 ) .",
    "our combined x / optical / mid - ir survey in lockman offers a way to test these various hypotheses .",
    "in particular , we detect with iso mid - ir emissions from a substantial fraction ( 33% ) of all lockman xmm sources ( fadda et al .",
    "this fraction increases to 63% of the x - ray sources selected at very hard energies ( 5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "x - ray objects undetected in the ir are consistent with also belonging to the same population but fainter than the isocam limits .",
    "for the few sources for which we have both 6.7 and 15 @xmath3 m flux detections ( 2 are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the lw3/lw2 flux ratios are inconsistent with being due to a starburst , and require an agn - like power source .",
    "we have compared in fig . 1 predicted seds for dusty quasars ( dashed lines ) with our observed optical / nir / mid - ir data .",
    "we have used radiative transfer models taken from granato et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and andreani , franceschini , granato ( 1999 ) , assuming a central point - like source surrounded by a dust distribution .",
    "the radius of the innermost dust shell is defined by the grain sublimation condition ( @xmath29 ) , which sets the short - wavelength limit of dust emission , while the outermost radius is a free parameter affecting the spectrum at the longest wavelengths .",
    "following andreani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we have represented a toroidal dust distribution as a `` flared '' disk with fixed covering factor @xmath30 and variable equatorial optical depth @xmath31 .",
    "our observed seds for type - i qso spectra are fit by solutions assuming pole - on ( @xmath32 ) or intermediate viewing inclinations .",
    "dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are solutions with @xmath33 ( edge - on view ) and equatorial optical - depths of typically @xmath4 , providing good fits to the observed 6.7 and 15 @xmath3 m fluxes for type - ii qsos .",
    "an important result of these fits is that , given the very red optical spectra of these sources , the contribution by scattered light from the primary continuum should be minimal or absent ( the parameter @xmath34 in our model has to be @xmath35 , see also wilman et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we lack , unfortunately , sensitive sub - mm observations in the lockman area to constrain the long - wavelength tail of the spectra for the x - ray / ir agn population : consequently , the maximum radius of the dust distribution and the dust masses are presently essentially unmeasurable . on the contrary ,",
    "data at 6.7 and 15 @xmath3 m ( in addition to those in optical / nir for type - i objects ) provide a robust constraint on the bolometric source luminosity ( the assumption of a central illuminating source implies in particular that the the bulk of the energy is emitted between 5 and 40 @xmath3 m for type - ii qsos ) .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] as a function of @xmath5 our estimated bolometric luminosities between 0.1 and 1000 @xmath3 m ( the x - ray flux would only add a minor contribution , see fig . 5 below ) for type - i and -ii agns in lockman ( open and filled squares respectively ) .",
    "this plot indicates that there is no systematic difference between the bolometric emissions of the two classes , at the various redshifts .",
    "this is in agreement with the standard unification paradigm .",
    "the x - ray flux has , on the contrary , a sensitive dependence on the column density of the obscuring medium .",
    "[ fig5 ] reports the fraction of radiation emitted in the various x - ray bands over the bolometric emission , and shows that type - ii qsos are systematically fainter emitters than type - i in soft x - rays , the difference reducing in the harder bands",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] require column densities of the x - ray absorbing gas for type - ii objects in the range @xmath36 to @xmath37 @xmath38 , not inconsistent with the extinction of @xmath4 inferred from the fits to the ir spectra . at the same time , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] implies that the contribution of the x - ray energy to the bolometric luminosity can not be dominant : the bulk of the qso primary energy is produced in the uv - optical , consistent with the average type - i spectrum by elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "finally , the completeness and large mid - ir identification fraction of our xmm sample in lockman allow also a statistical test of xrb models . again in rough agreement with the unification scheme ( e.g. lawrence 1991 ) , the ratio of the number of type - ii to type - i qsos appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is @xmath39 in the redshift interval @xmath40 of maximal sensitivity for our combined x / ir survey .",
    "we have exploited very deep x - ray and mid - ir survey data obtained for the first time by iso , xmm - newton and _ chandra _ in common areas of the lockman hole and hdfn , to test standard models for the origin of the xrb and the supposed dust - obscured accretion phenomenon .",
    "the large surveyed area in lockman was essential to detect significant numbers of luminous obscured agns , too rare to be appropriately sampled in the small hdfn field .",
    "this combined x - ray / ir survey detects normal type - i quasars with standard optical , ir and x - ray properties ( blue colours , power - law x - ray and ir spectra ) .",
    "in addition , a rich population of x - ray luminous sources with red optical colours is identified , roughly half of which would be classified as extremely red objects ( r - k@xmath0 ) in the optical .",
    "their optical seds are those typical of normal massive elliptical or spiral galaxies at the appropriate @xmath5 .",
    "x - ray sources with similarly red counterparts have also been occasionally reported ( fiore et al . 2000 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ; barger et al . 2001 ; lehmann et al .",
    "2001 ; cowie et al .",
    "2001 ) .    while the ultimate nuclear energy source in these objects has to be quasar - like gravitational accretion , given the large x - ray luminosities ( @xmath41 erg / s ) , an important hint on the physics comes from the mid - ir data at 6.7 and 15 @xmath3 m .",
    "these data are well reproduced by model spectra of obscured quasars under standard assumptions and line - of - sight optical depths of typically @xmath42 .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis , including radiative transfer in the ir and comptonization effects in the x - rays , is in progress ( granato et al . in preparation ) .",
    "altogether we find that various predictions of the standard xrb picture ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "1994 ; comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) are met by our analysis , within the uncertainties implied by the small number of sources .",
    "in particular , the bolometric luminosity distributions do not appear to be systematically different between type - i and -ii objects , and their observed relative fractions are consistently close to the canonically assumed value of 1:3 .",
    "also the x - ray luminosities and hardness ratios of type - ii objects show evidence of photoelectric absorption at low x - ray energies .",
    "we believe that these results provide important new evidence that obscured gravitational accretion in massive normal - looking galaxies is responsible for the bulk of the x - ray background : the energy which is absorbed in x - rays ( which could be as much as 80 - 90% when averaged over the whole population producing the xrb , see fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) is found by us to be down - graded in photon energy and re - emitted in the ir , as expected . in spite of this , and following the correlation analysis of deep x - ray and ir images by fadda et al .",

    "2001 ) of the cosmic ir background can be attributed to x - ray loud agns ."
