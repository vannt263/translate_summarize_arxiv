    "traditionally , elliptical galaxies have been regarded as ancient stellar systems in which evolutionary processes have been exhausted or completely arrested .",
    "however , recent observational and theoretical developments have led to a reassessment of both the ages of the stars in ellipticals and the ages since the stellar system merged into its current configuration .",
    "our objective here is to illustrate the possibly important contribution to the apparent global stellar age in ellipticals due to a population of young , intermediate mass stars formed from cooled interstellar ( cooling flow ) gas .",
    "we also review the related structural history of ellipticals .",
    "the high degree of structural regularity among ellipticals has been used to argue that they were among the first galaxies that formed .",
    "of most interest are the remarkable thinness of the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davies 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; renzini & ciotti 1993 ) , the tightness of the color magnitude relation ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ) and the tight correlation between central @xmath6 line strength and central velocity dispersion @xmath7 ( bender , burstein , & faber 1993 ; ziegler & bender 1997 ) , indicating an intimate connection between parameters that characterize chemical and dynamical evolution .",
    "the small scatter about these relations is difficult to reproduce if there is a wide range of ages among ellipticals .",
    "moreover , distant elliptical galaxies at redshifts @xmath8 exhibit these same strong correlations ( aragon - salamanca et al . 1993 ; ellis et al . 1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ; van dokkum et al . 1998b ; barger et al . 1998 ; broadhurst & bouwens 1999 ) , but are brighter overall ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) , suggesting an early formation epoch @xmath9 for an @xmath10 , @xmath11 universe ( van dokkum et al .",
    "1998a ) .    set against this conventional picture",
    "are a number of recent studies that suggest that most or many ellipticals have formed continuously over time by mergers that introduce morphological disturbances ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) and new generations of young stars ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "some observations of stellar photometric indices ( prugniel , golev , & maubon 1999 ) and deficiencies of e galaxies at redshifts @xmath12 ( kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ) support significant ongoing evolution , particularly for field ellipticals , but other studies at these redshifts indicate a nearly constant e / s0 space density ( i m et al .",
    "1996 : franceschini et al . 1998 ) and old formation ages ( bernardi et al . 1998 )",
    ".    the age of stars in ellipticals has also been questioned , but progress has been confounded by the age - metallicity conspiracy : youthful , metal - rich and old , metal - poor populations are nearly indistinguishable ( worthey 1997 ) . however , lick observers have demonstrated that balmer absorption lines can partially break this age - metallicity degeneracy ( gonzalez 1993 ; faber et al .",
    "1995 ; trager 1997 ) . by comparing the h@xmath4 equivalent width ( index ) and a mg + fe photometric index with expectations from worthey s evolutionary models ,",
    "gonzalez found a wide range of apparent ages in a sample of 40 ( mostly field ) ellipticals for which the mean age is only @xmath13 gyrs .",
    "in addition , stars in the inner regions of these galaxies ( @xmath14 ) are about 3 gyrs younger ( and more metal - rich ) than those at larger radii .",
    "these stellar ages are inconsistent with 13 - 15 gyrs , formerly thought to be more likely .",
    "the age spread is larger for ellipticals of lower luminosity .",
    "most of the h@xmath4 equivalent width is contributed by f and g dwarf stars near main sequence turnoff .",
    "in a series of recent papers we have presented detailed models of the evolution of elliptical galaxies with an emphasis on the gas dynamics of the hot interstellar gas ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1999a ; 1999b ) .",
    "galactic stars are assumed to form at @xmath15 gyr and the de vaucouleurs structure of the large ellipticals is constructed at @xmath16 gyrs .",
    "our calculations successfully reproduce currently observed interstellar ( cooling flow ) density , temperature and ( iron ) abundance profiles in massive ellipticals with a minimum of adjustable parameters .    the global rate that interstellar gas cools can be estimated by dividing the observed ( bolometric ) x - ray luminosity @xmath17 by the enthalpy per gram of the gas , @xmath18 @xmath1 yr@xmath19 where @xmath20 k is typical of large ellipticals ( @xmath21 proton mass ; @xmath22 molecular weight ) .",
    "the total mass of gas that cools over cosmic time , several @xmath23 @xmath1 , is only about 4 - 5 percent of the total baryonic mass currently in stars .",
    "two of the most perplexing and long standing problems concerning galactic cooling flows are ( 1 ) to determine where cooling to low temperatures actually occurs in the galaxies and ( 2 ) to determine the final physical disposition of the cooled gas",
    ". the dropout or cooling of interstellar gas must occur over a substantial volume of the inner galaxy , but the radial mass profile of cooled gas can not be predicted from first principles since it depends critically on entropy fluctuations acquired during a variety of complex processes ( stellar mass loss , supernovae explosions , magnetic field variations , etc . ) . to accommodate this uncertainty ,",
    "we have considered a variety of cooling dropout models in which the hot gas is assumed to cool at a rate @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the local ( constant pressure ) cooling time and @xmath26 is an adjustable dropout function ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) .",
    "we compare computed interstellar properties with currently ( @xmath27 gyrs ) observed interstellar gas in the luminous elliptical ngc 4472 .",
    "most of these models are unacceptable because the radial distributions of x - ray surface brightness @xmath28 , gas density @xmath29 or temperature @xmath30 disagree with profiles observed in this galaxy . among the models considered , the simple constant @xmath31 model gave the best results ,",
    "although the agreement with observed @xmath28 was still not perfect ; we consider this model again here to estimate the mass dropout in ngc 4472 .    regarding the second perplexing and long standing problem ,",
    "it has long been speculated that the end product of the cooled gas are low mass , non - luminous stars ( fabian , nulsen & canizares 1982 ; thomas 1986 ; cowie & binney 1988 ; vedder , trester & canizares 1988 ; sarazin & ashe 1989 ; ferland , fabian & johnstone 1994 ) .",
    "we have recently reconsidered the star formation process in elliptical galaxy cooling flows and have concluded that the mass of stars in the dropout stellar population probably extends to @xmath0 @xmath1 , i.e. _ the dropout population is optically luminous _ ( mathews & brighenti 1999a ) . as cold gas collects at a cooling site , it becomes gravitationally unstable at this limiting mass , setting a firm upper mass limit @xmath32 on the imf for stars forming in the central regions of massive ellipticals .",
    "the upper mass limit on the ( bottom - heavy ) imf increases only modestly with galactic radius ( @xmath33 @xmath1 at @xmath34 ) and is almost independent of time during the evolution of the cooling flow for redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "additional support for the formation of optically luminous stars in galactic cooling flows is provided by the thinness of the fundamental plane . for agreement with",
    "observed x - ray surface brightness distributions in ellipticals , most of the mass of cooled gas is concentrated well within @xmath35 where the relatively small dropout mass can contribute substantially to the central mass and mass to light ratio determined from stellar velocities .",
    "if the dropout stellar population is assumed to be non - luminous , mathews & brighenti ( 1999b ) have shown that the variation of dark dropout mass among ellipticals causes large , undesirable shifts in the fundamental plane that are incompatible with its observed thinness .",
    "however , these perturbations on the fundamental plane may be lessened or removed if the dropout stars are luminous .",
    "star formation in ellipticals is efficient in the sense that the total mass of hii gas and cold neutral or molecular gas at any time are both much less than the total mass of gas that has cooled .",
    "therefore , the star formation rate ( @xmath38 ) in ngc 4472 is equal to the instantaneous rate that hot interstellar gas cools by radiative losses .",
    "the total accumulated mass that has cooled in ngc 4472 since @xmath16 gyr , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are shown in figure 1a ; these are based on the @xmath41 model that best fits the x - ray observations of ngc 4472 ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) .",
    "the mass dropout @xmath42 at @xmath27 gyrs for this model occurs mostly in @xmath43 and the total dropout mass is @xmath44 @xmath1 .",
    "this is much less than the total current stellar mass in ngc 4472 , @xmath45 @xmath1 , determined with @xmath46 .    for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we assume that the old galactic stars can be approximated as a single burst stellar population having a salpeter imf from @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath1 .",
    "by contrast , the younger dropout stellar population with variable sfr , @xmath49 , is assumed to have a salpeter imf from @xmath47 to @xmath50 @xmath1 .",
    "both of these imfs are available in single burst format in the 1999 bruzual - charlot library for isochrone synthesis spectral evolution ( charlot & bruzual 1991 : bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , assuming solar abundance .",
    "the total b - band luminosity of the dropout stellar population is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the single burst b - band luminosity per unit solar mass .",
    "the luminosity of the background old single burst population is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a coefficient of order unity that must be adjusted for agreement with the observed b - band luminosity of ngc 4472 ( see below ) .",
    "the evolution of b - band luminosities and b - v colors are illustrated in figure 1b and 1c for each stellar population and for their combined radiation .",
    "for reference , the redshift @xmath55 is shown at time @xmath56 gyrs ( assuming @xmath57 km s@xmath19 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .",
    "we have chosen @xmath58 so that the total b - band luminosity @xmath59 @xmath60 , appropriate for ngc 4472 at distance @xmath61 mpc .",
    "although the dropout population currently contributes about 15 percent of the total b - band light ( @xmath62 @xmath60 ) , its fractional contribution to the galactic light is quite constant for redshifts @xmath12 .",
    "the combined do+old population is only slightly bluer ( by @xmath63 ) than the old population and this difference is essentially constant for @xmath12 .",
    "formally , the @xmath64 of the combined population indicates an age @xmath65 gyrs that is less than that of the old population alone , 12 gyrs , but metallicity variations could produce a similar color variation .    to estimate the equivalent width of h@xmath4",
    "we assume that the line width is similar for both populations : @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the ratio of light from the old to dropout population within projected radius @xmath70 normalized to the total ratio of old to dropout light ; generally we assume @xmath71 , corresponding to viewing the total light from both populations .    as an illustration , we use single burst @xmath72 from the 1999 bruzual - charlot ( bc99 ) tables appropriate to the imf of each population .",
    "as shown in figure 2 the dropout population ( with @xmath71 ) reduces the apparent age of the old population by @xmath73 gyrs , i.e. @xmath74 , in agreement with observations that correlate bluer colors with stronger h@xmath4 ( forbes & ponman 1999 ) . for smaller @xmath75 , corresponding to viewing ngc 4472 within @xmath35",
    ", the apparent age is reduced by @xmath65 gyrs .",
    "actual observations of galactic cores view a fraction of both populations , i.e. the apparent h@xmath4 age is aperture - dependent . for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "are insensitive to @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath79 can be assumed .",
    "we also used the population code available at the worthey website to determine both @xmath78 and @xmath80 for a salpeter dropout imf from @xmath81 to @xmath82 @xmath1 . for this model the h@xmath4 and",
    "@xmath83 ages are 8.5 and 9.5 gyrs with @xmath71 .",
    "these age uncertainties are consistent with ( @xmath84 % ) errors inherent to population synthesis procedures ( charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 ; worthey 1996 ) .",
    "clearly , however , the contribution of cooling dropout stars to the spectra of elliptical galaxies can explain the relatively young ages inferred from h@xmath4 observed in some ellipticals even if the underlying stars are very old .",
    "all massive ellipticals contain cooling interstellar gas so no comparisons with gas - free galaxies can be made . however , since the cooling flow mass dropout is centrally concentrated within @xmath35 , the equivalent width of h@xmath4 , @xmath85 , should increase toward galactic centers , in agreement with the observations of gonzalez ( 1993 ) .",
    "dropout star formation should be accompanied by an ensemble of additional observations at small galactic radii : h@xmath4 _ in emission _ from cooling clouds , enhanced x - ray surface brightness due to dense , locally cooling regions , and lower apparent x - ray temperatures which ( with hydrostatic equilibrium ) indicate interior masses _ less _ than the known stellar mass .",
    "such mass discrepancies within @xmath86 are apparent in x - ray observations of bright virgo ellipticals ( brighenti & mathews 1997a ) .",
    "some fraction of the total optical light ( @xmath87 percent in figure 1 ) in e galaxies comes from the dropout population with @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , @xmath89 should vary with galactic radius and produce a shift away from the fundamental plane defined by the old stars alone .",
    "the observed apparent h@xmath4 age spread among ellipticals is large : 2 to 12 gyrs in the gonzalez ( 1993 ) sample , 5 to 12 gyrs in the fornax cluster ( kuntschner & davies 1998 ) and 8 to 12 gyrs in the coma cluster ( jorgensen 1999 ) .",
    "such variations can be expected if the cooling dropout profile @xmath26 differs among otherwise similar galaxies , represented here with the factor @xmath90 . but some of the age variation may arise from comparing ellipticals of greatly different @xmath2 .",
    "interstellar x - ray emission from ellipticals with @xmath91 is masked by stellar x - rays , but cooling flows still exist in these faster rotating , low @xmath2 ellipticals .",
    "we have shown ( brighenti & mathews 1997b ) that large cold gas disks may form from cooling flow gas in low @xmath2 ellipticals similar to the hi disks observed by oosterloo , morganti & sadler ( 1999 ) .",
    "occasional star formation with normal imfs and maximal @xmath85 ( de jong & davies 1997 ) is therefore expected in low @xmath2 ellipticals . in luminous ellipticals ( @xmath92 )",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath85 will generally be lower due to isolated star formation in the high pressure ism .",
    "but @xmath3 varies enormously among bright ellipticals of similar @xmath2 and h@xmath4 ages should reflect this same variation since the fraction of mass in the dropout population is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "as expected , ellipticals in gonzalez sample with @xmath93 and low @xmath3  ngc 4649 , ngc 7619 and ngc 7626  also appear to be very old ( @xmath94 gyrs ) . however , this interpretation is not entirely straightforward ; ellipticals with large @xmath3 also have larger interstellar pressure which may result in @xmath95 and lower h@xmath4 indices .",
    "although h@xmath4 ages are insensitive to the imf of the dropout population for @xmath96 @xmath1 , as @xmath32 approaches @xmath97 , @xmath85 decreases ; this is just the range in @xmath32 anticipated from our model of star formation in luminous ellipticals ( mathews & brighenti 1999a ) .",
    "the h@xmath4 index may not vary monotonically with @xmath3 .",
    "although the star formation process described here obviates the need for continued galactic merging to account for the h@xmath4 equivalent widths observed , we do not claim that recent merging in ellipticals is non - existent or unimportant .",
    "we do note , however , that rather few images of ellipticals at small redshift indicate ongoing mergers with gas - rich , star - forming galaxies .",
    "but if such regular mergers do generate young stellar populations in ellipticals , it may be possible to detect azimuthal asymmetries in the stellar h@xmath4 that reflect the orbital plane(s ) of the newly - introduced stars .",
    "young stars formed from cooling flow dropout are expected to be symmetrically disposed in the galactic potential , but their orbits may be more radial with narrower lines than those of the old stellar population .",
    "we are indebted to stephane charlot for providing h@xmath4 indices for the two populations considered and to stuart norton for helpful advice .",
