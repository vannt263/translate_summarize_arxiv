    "the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism has been the subject of study for many decades  @xcite .",
    "recently theoretical and experimental investigations into the properties of superconductor / ferromagnetic - metal / superconductor ( s - fm - s ) heterostructures  @xcite have seen an upsurge in interest after the experimental observation of 0-@xmath0 transitions in the josephson current through s - fm - s junction by ryanzanov et al .",
    "@xcite and by kontos et al .",
    "@xcite . in terms of the josephson relationship @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the phase difference between the two superconductor layers ,",
    "a transition from the 0 to @xmath0 states implies a change in sign of @xmath5 from positive to negative .",
    "physically , such a change in sign of @xmath5 is a consequence of a phase change in the pairing wave - function induced in the fm layer due to the proximity effect .",
    "josephson junctions presenting a negative @xmath5 are usually called @xmath0 junctions and such behavior has been observed experimentally .",
    "recently , @xmath6 qubits consisting of a superconducting loop with a s - fm - s @xmath0 junction have been theoretically proposed  @xcite . in the quiet qubits , a quantum two level system ( qubits )",
    "is spontaneously generated and therefore it is expected to be robust to the decoherence by the fluctuation of the external magnetic field . from the viewpoint of the quantum dissipation , however , the structure of s - fm - s junctions is inherently identical with s - n - s junctions ( n is a normal nonmagnetic metal ) .",
    "therefore a gapless quasiparticle excitation in the fm layer is inevitable .",
    "this feature gives a strong ohmic dissipation  @xcite and the coherence time of s - fm - s quiet qubits is bound to be very short .    on the other hand ,",
    "as was predicted by tanaka and kashiwaya  @xcite , the @xmath0 junction can be formed in josephson junctions with ferromagnetic insulators ( fi ) . by following their theory ,",
    "we have theoretically proposed a superconductor phase-  @xcite and flux - type qubits  @xcite based on s - fi - s @xmath0 junctions .",
    "moreover we have showed that the effect of the dissipation due to the quasi - particle excitation on macroscopic quantum tunneling is negligibly small  @xcite . however , in above studies , we have used a very simple @xmath7-function model as the fi barrier .",
    "therefore , the correspondence between this toy mode and the actual band structure of fi is still unclear . in this paper",
    ", we will formulate a numerical calculation method for the josephson current through fi by taking into account the band structure of fi .",
    "then we will discuss the possibility of the formation of the @xmath0-coupling for the josephson junction through the eu chalcogenides .",
    "recently spin filtering effect are intensively studied by use of the the eu chalcogenides  @xcite .",
    "the eu chalcogenides stand out among the fis as ideal heisenberg ferromagnets , with a high magnetic moment and a large exchange splitting of the conduction band for eu @xmath1-electrons . utilizing the exchange splitting ( @xmath8 ) to filter spins ,",
    "these materials produce a near - fully spin - polarized current when used as a tunnel barrier . of the eu chalcogenides , euo has the largest @xmath8 and the highest curie temperature ( @xmath9 k for bulk ) .    in euo ,",
    "the large saturation magnetic moment @xmath10 per eu@xmath11 originates from the seven unpaired electrons localized at the @xmath12 levels in the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band , shown schematically in fig .",
    "ferromagnetic order of the @xmath12 spins causes exchange splitting of the conduction band , lowering ( raising ) the spin - up ( -down ) band symmetrically by @xmath13 .",
    "thus , free carriers in the conduction @xmath1 band are spin - polarized . a large exchange splitting of 0.54 ev",
    "was first determined by measuring the redshift of the absorption edge in single crystals of euo cooled below @xmath14  @xcite .        when an ultrathin film of euo is used as the tunnel barrier between two metallic electrodes , the exchange splitting of the conduction band gives rise to a lower barrier height for spin - up electrons and a higher barrier height for spin - down electrons . because of the tunnel current depends exponentially on the barrier height  @xcite , the tunneling probability for spin - up electrons is much greater than for spin - down electrons , leading to a highly spin - polarized current .",
    "this phenomenon is called the spin - filter effect .",
    "in this section , we develop a numerical calculation method of the josephson current for s - fi - s junctions  @xcite . let us consider the two - dimensional two - band tight - binding model for a s - fi - s junction as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the vector @xmath15 points to a lattice site , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are unit vectors in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions , respectively . in the @xmath19 direction , we apply the periodic boundary condition for the number of lattice sites being @xmath20 .",
    "electronic states in superconductor are described by the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath21    \\notag \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{r}\\in \\text{s}}\\left [ \\tilde{c}_{% \\boldsymbol{r}}^{\\dagger } \\;\\hat{\\delta}\\;\\overline{\\tilde{c}_{\\boldsymbol{r}% } ^{\\dagger } } -\\overline{\\tilde{c}_{\\boldsymbol{r}}}\\;\\hat{\\delta}^{\\ast } \\;% \\tilde{c}_{\\boldsymbol{r}}\\right ] ,   \\label{bcs}\\end{aligned}\\]]@xmath22 \\hat{\\sigma}_{0 } \\notag , \\end{aligned}\\]]with @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at @xmath26 with spin @xmath27 ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 means the transpose of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is @xmath33 unit matrix . in superconductors ,",
    "the hopping integral @xmath34 is considered among nearest neighbor sites and we choose @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the amplitude of the pair potential in the @xmath37-wave symmetry channel , and @xmath38 is a pauli matrix .        in a ferromagnetic insulator ,",
    "we have used a following two - band hamiltonian : @xmath39 where @xmath40 ) is the creation operator , @xmath41 is the hopping integral and @xmath42 is the exchange splitting of @xmath43 electrons .",
    "the fermi energy of @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are , respectively , given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the energy gap of the @xmath43 band ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the third term @xmath47 of the hamiltonian describes the mixing between @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "it was recognized for a long time that the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing is very important to understand magnetic properties of the eu chalcogenides .",
    "so we have taken into account the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the hamiltonian is diagonalized by the bogoliubov transformation and the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation is numerically solved by the recursive green function method  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the matsubara green function , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the matsubara frequency , @xmath50 is an integer number , and @xmath51 is a temperature .",

    "we fix the following parameters : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the superconductor transition temperature ) .",
    "below , we consider the josephson transport through the eu - chalcogenides . in calculation , we use the following parameters in consideration of euo  @xcite : @xmath59ev , @xmath60ev , @xmath61ev , and @xmath62ev .",

    "the black and white regime correspond to the @xmath0 and 0 junction , respectively .",

    "4 shows the numerically obtained @xmath71 phase diagram .",
    "the @xmath0 junction can be realized at the certain values of @xmath66 and @xmath72 .",
    "we found that the @xmath0 junction can be formed if ( 1 ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands are overlapped each other and ( 2 ) the @xmath1-@xmath2 hybridization @xmath66 is strong enough .",
    "more detailed discussion for above results will be given in elsewhere  @xcite .",
