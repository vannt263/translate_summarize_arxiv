    "it was shown that there exist immersed complete nonminimal cmc surfaces with two ends in @xmath0 with genus @xmath2 . and",

    "if @xmath7 is a local representation for a minimal surface in @xmath0 with first and second fundamental forms @xmath8 and @xmath9 , then we see ( via the gauss and codazzi equations and the fundamental theorem for surfaces ) that there is a well - defined cmc 1 surface @xmath10 with first and second fundamental forms @xmath8 and @xmath11 . in addition , cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 have a weierstrass representation based on a pair of holomorphic functions @xcite , similar to the weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in @xmath0 ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the following theorem was first proven by levitt and rosenberg , and holds for any cmc @xmath3 surface , not just for surfaces satisfying @xmath12 .",
    "we include a proof here ( section 3 ) for the sake of completeness .",

    "( this was shown in @xcite .",
    "the genus 0 catenoid cousins were originally described in @xcite . ) the condition that the surface has asymptotic boundary at most two points implies that @xmath13 , as shown by do carmo , gomes , and thorbergsson @xcite .",
    "we will show that the condition `` embedded '' is critical to the above theorem , by giving an immersed counterexample , which we call the genus 1 catenoid cousin .",
    "there exists a one - parameter family of cmc 1 genus 1 complete properly immersed surfaces in @xmath1 with asymptotic boundary consisting of two points .",
    "the genus 1 catenoid cousin demonstrates a clear difference between cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 and minimal surfaces in @xmath0 , since schoen s result on minimal surfaces in @xmath0 holds even for immersions .",
    "the genus 1 catenoid cousin further shows that the set of cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 with embedded ends is in some sense larger than the set of minimal surfaces in @xmath0 with embedded ends . loosely speaking ,",
    "the set of complete minimal surfaces with embedded ends in @xmath0 can be mapped injectively to a set of ( one - parameter families of ) corresponding complete cmc 1 surfaces with embedded ends in @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second theorem above shows that we can not map the set of ( one - parameter families of ) complete cmc 1 surfaces with embedded ends in @xmath1 injectively to a set of corresponding complete minimal surfaces with embedded ends in @xmath0 , since there does not exist a minimal surface in @xmath0 which corresponds to the genus 1 catenoid cousin in @xmath14 .    in section 4",
    "we give a nonrigorous explanation for why one should expect the genus 1 catenoid cousins to exist .",
    "the remainder of the paper is then devoted to proving theorem 1.2 rigorously .",
    "we believe that the proof has two interesting characteristics :    * one is that the period problems that must be solved can be reduced to a single period problem , using symmetry properties of the surface , by a fairly direct argument .",
    "this kind of dimension reduction of the period problem can usually be done in a geometric and uncomplicated way for minimal surfaces is @xmath0 , but for cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 this kind of dimension reduction seems to be inherently more algebraic and less geometrically transparent @xcite .",
    "* the other is that we then solve the single remaining period numerically , and then we use a mathematically rigorous analysis of the numerical method to conclude that the numerical results are correct .",
    "certainly , this kind of `` numerical error analysis '' has been used before , for example in @xcite and @xcite , and it is likely to be used frequently in the future , as it is well suited for solving period problems on surfaces for which no other method of solution can be found .",
    "it is easy to imagine how this method could be useful in a very wide variety of situations .",
    "we solve the single period problem by applying the intermediate value theorem .",
    "the idea is similar to the way the intermediate value theorem is used in the conjugate plateau construction to solve period problems for minimal surfaces in @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the conjugate plateau construction fails to help us in the study of cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 , hence we have used numerical analysis instead .",
    "( the conjugate plateau construction _ is _ of use in studying _",
    "minimal _ surfaces in @xmath1 @xcite , but does not appear to be useful for studying cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 . )    the same methods we use here could likely also be applied to produce similar examples with two ends and genus greater than one , without any conceptual additions .",
    "however , with genus greater than 1 , after reducing the period problems to a minimal set , we would still have at least a 2-dimensional problem , and thus the computational aspects would become much more involved . as the genus 1 example fulfills our goal of finding a counterexample to schoen s result in the hyperbolic case ( and is computationally more easily understandable ) , we felt it was appropriate to restrict ourselves to genus 1 .",
    "although this paper is written from a mathematical viewpoint , the arguments used here became apparent to the authors only by means of a numerical experiment .",
    "hence , from the authors point of view , experimental results were essential in obtaining the above result .",
    "both minimal surfaces in @xmath0 and cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 can be described parametrically by a pair of meromorphic functions on a riemann surface , via a weierstrass representation .",
    "first we describe the well - known weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in @xmath0",
    ". we will incorporate into this representation the fact that any complete minimal surface of finite total curvature is conformally equivalent to a riemann surface @xmath15 with a finite number of points @xmath16 removed ( @xcite ) :    let @xmath15 be a riemann surface .",

    "we shall use the poincare model and these totally geodesic planes in the proof of theorem  1.1 , which we now give .",
    "we consider a complete properly embedded cmc surface @xmath87 in @xmath1 .",
    "first we suppose that @xmath87 has asymptotic boundary consisting of exactly two points .",
    "applying an isometry of @xmath14 if necessary , we may assume that these two asymptotic points are at the north and south poles @xmath88 .",

    "let @xmath99 be the largest value @xmath100 such that for all @xmath101 less than @xmath100 , int(@xmath97 ) and int(@xmath102 ) are disjoint .",
    "when @xmath101 is close to -1 or 1 , @xmath103 is empty , so it follows that such a @xmath99 exists and that @xmath104 .",
    "it then follows ( since @xmath87 is properly embedded ) that there exists a finite point of common tangency between @xmath105 and @xmath106 , and that one surface lies above the other in a neighborhood of this point of common tangency .",
    "the maximum principle implies that @xmath107 .",
    "( this is the alexandrov reflection principle . )",
    "since @xmath87 has only two ends at the north and south poles , it must be that @xmath108 . since @xmath89 was an arbitrary horizontal vector",
    ", it follows that @xmath87 is symmetric with respect to any geodesic plane through the north and south poles .",
    "thus it is a surface of revolution .",
    "if the surface @xmath87 has no ends or only one point in its asymptotic boundary , one can similarly conclude that @xmath87 is a surface of revolution ( spheres and horospheres ) .",
    "in sections 5 and 6 , we give a rigorous proof of existence of the genus 1 catenoid cousin .",
    "however , since the proof itself does not enlighten the reader as to why it should exist , we give a motivation in this section for why we should expect this surface to exist .",
    "as noted in section 2 , it was shown in @xcite that for any complete finite total curvature minimal surface in @xmath0 which satisfies certain conditions , there exists a corresponding 1-parameter family of cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "so , in this sense , the set of cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 is a larger set than the set of minimal surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "we now briefly sketch the ideas behind the result in @xcite .",
    "we do not describe the method in detail , as the reader can refer to @xcite .",
    "we start with a given minimal surface in @xmath0 , and thus have a riemann surface @xmath15 and meromorphic functions @xmath20 and @xmath19 given to us by the weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in @xmath0 ( lemma 2.1 ) .",
    "we can use this same @xmath15 and @xmath20 and @xmath19 in the hyperbolic weierstrass representation ( lemma 2.2 ) to produce a cmc @xmath3 surface in @xmath31 for each real number @xmath3 .    as @xmath109 , the poincare model for @xmath31 ( a ball in @xmath0 with euclidean radius @xmath67 ) converges to euclidean space @xmath0 , and these cmc @xmath3 surfaces in @xmath31",
    "converge to the given minimal surface ( in the sense of @xmath110 uniform convergence on compact sets ) .",
    "thus for @xmath3 close to zero , we can think of compact regions of the cmc @xmath3 surfaces in @xmath31 as small deformations of compact regions of the given minimal surface in @xmath0 .",
    "if the given minimal surface in @xmath0 is not simply - connected , then there is a question about whether the deformed cmc @xmath3 surfaces in @xmath111 are well - defined .",
    "this is the period problem .",
    "( the period problem being solvable essentially means that a certain set of equations per@xmath112 can be solved with respect to certain parameters @xmath113 of the surface .",
    "this will be explained in detail in terms of an @xmath114 condition in the next section . )",
    "the minimal surface is assumed to have a `` nondegeneracy '' property , as defined in @xcite . since the period problem is nondegenerate and solvable on the minimal surface , and",
    "since the period problem changes continuously with respect to @xmath3 , the period problem can still be solved when @xmath3 is sufficiently close to 0 .",
    "thus , for @xmath3 sufficiently close to 0 , the cmc @xmath3 surfaces in @xmath31 are well - defined .",
    "dilating the poincare model for @xmath31 by a factor of @xmath69 ( as described in section 2 ) , we produce a one - parameter family of cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath14 , with parameter @xmath3 .",
    "this is the method used in @xcite to create well - defined non - simply - connected cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath1 from non - simply - connected minimal surfaces in @xmath0 .    as an example of this , consider the minimal genus 1 trinoid in @xmath0 . as discussed in @xcite , there is a single real parameter @xmath63 in the weierstrass data that can be adjusted to solve the period problem .",
    "the period problem is represented by a map @xmath115 , and to solve the period problem we must show that there exists a value of @xmath63 so that per(@xmath63 ) = 0 .",
    "we note that the function per(@xmath63 ) changes continuously in @xmath3 . since the period problem for the minimal genus 1 trinoid in @xmath116 ( when @xmath3 is 0 ) is solvable and nondegenerate , this implies that there exists an interval @xmath117 so that the image of this interval under the map per contains an interval about 0 . by continuity ,",
    "if we perturb @xmath3 slightly away from 0 , it still holds that @xmath118 per(@xmath119 ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath3 sufficiently close to zero , there exists a cmc @xmath3 genus 1 trinoid cousin in @xmath31 .",
    "then , by dilating the poincare model , we produce a cmc 1 genus 1 trinoid cousin in @xmath120 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "= 1.8 in = 1.8 in    now let us consider weierstrass data that would produce a minimal genus 1 catenoid is @xmath0 . again there is a single real parameter @xmath63 in the weierstrass data that can be adjusted , and again the period problem is represented by a map @xmath115 , and to solve the period problem we must again show that there exists a value of @xmath63 so that per(@xmath63 ) = 0 . the weierstrass data is described in the next section . in this case the period problem can not be solved , since the function per is always positive , but the function per can get arbitrarily close to 0 .",
    "so we have that an interval @xmath121 is contained in the image of per , for some @xmath122 .",
    "if we perturb @xmath3 slightly , we expect that the image interval @xmath121 gets perturbed continuously .",
    "the authors have found by numerical experiment that when @xmath3 becomes slightly negative , the image interval @xmath121 changes to an image interval of the form @xmath123 , where @xmath124 .",
    "thus as @xmath3 becomes negative , the lower endpoint of the image interval moves in a positive direction .",
    "if this behavior were nondegenerate at @xmath125 , then one would expect that as @xmath3 is perturbed slightly in a positive direction , the image interval would become of the form @xmath123 , where @xmath126 .",
    "we have found by numerical experiment that this is indeed the case .",
    "thus for slightly positive values of @xmath3 , we can adjust a real parameter in the weierstrass data so that the period function per becomes zero . then , after dilating the poincare model , we have existence of a cmc 1 genus 1 catenoid cousin in @xmath120 .",
    "the behavior of the genus 1 catenoid as @xmath3 is perturbed is similar to the behavior of the genus 1 trinoid as @xmath3 is perturbed .",
    "as @xmath3 becomes negative , the genus 1 trinoid cousin eventually becomes embedded .",
    "if the period problem could be solved for the genus 1 catenoid cousin when @xmath127 , the resulting surface would be embedded , but as we know by theorem 1.1 , such a surface can not exist .",
    "but when solving the period problem for @xmath128 , the genus 1 catenoid cousin is not embedded , just in the same way that the genus 1 trinoid cousin is not embedded for @xmath128 .",
    "so this numerical experiment is consistent with theorem  1.1 , and furthermore shows that theorem  1.1 holds only for embedded surfaces .    in the next sections",
    ", we will prove theorem 1.2 .",
    "first we describe the weierstrass representation and the period problem .",
    "then we give the proof .",
    "initially the period problem is a three dimensional problem .",
    "we reduce the period problem by algebraic arguments to a one dimensional problem , then we show by a numerical calculation and the intermediate value theorem that this one dimensional period problem can be solved .",
    "the remainder of the proof is essentially a mathematically rigorous verification that the numerical experiment we conducted is correct .",
    "we must give mathematically rigorous bounds for both computer round - off error and for error introduced by discretizing the problem .",
    "we will show the errors are sufficiently small to ensure existence of a solution to the period problem .",
