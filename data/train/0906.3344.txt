    "in intense laser field ( ilf ) , an atom may absorb multiple photons , more than that required for ionization , and then it will eject a high energy photoelectron .",
    "such a nonlinear phenomenon of multiphoton process is called above - threshold ionization ( ati ) @xcite . in general , the photoelectron spectrum of ati consists of multiple peaks , separated by one photon energy @xcite .",
    "many theoretical methods have been developed to study this multiphoton phenomenon , such as solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite , or the semiclassical trajectory methods including two - step model @xcite and feynman s path - integral approach in the strong field approximation @xcite .",
    "bohmian mechanics ( bm ) @xcite , or called quantum trajectory method @xcite , is an alternative to quantum mechanics .",
    "it has been successfully used to study some fundamental quantum phenomena such as tunneling @xcite and the two - slit experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , bm has been extensively applied to study many novel quantum processes in physics and chemistry , such as atom - surface physics @xcite , electron transport in mesoscopic systems @xcite , photodissociation of nocl and no@xmath0 @xcite , and the chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "it has also been regarded as a resultful approach to studying chaos @xcite and decoherence @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "bm is introduced to intense laser - atom physics to study the multiphoton phenomenon of ati .",
    "the trajectory of each atomic electron in an ensemble can be deterministically obtained from the bohm - newton equation which is a subtle transformation of the schrdinger equation and equal to it statistically @xcite . then the energy of an ionized electron , or called photoelectron , can be calculated from its trajectory . by rearranging all photoelectrons according to their energies ,",
    "we gain a photoelectron spectrum of ati which is consistent with the previous theoretical and experimental results .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the classical trajectory monte - carlo method ( ctmcm ) and conclude that a term in bohm - newton equation , called quantum potential , may play a key role to precisely reproduce the spectrum of ati .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : we will briefly introduce bm first .",
    "then we show the hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom in ilf .",
    "the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation and details of bm for ati together with the photoelectron spectrum are given .",
    "next we compare our result with the previous theoretical and experimental results of ati .",
    "finally , we compare bm with ctmcm and then conclude .",
    "bohm - newton equation comes from a subtle transformation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "a wave function @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real functions .",
    "inserting @xmath5 into the time - dependent schrdinger equation , we obtain two equations by separating the time - dependent schrdinger equation into real and imaginary parts . the real part gives    @xmath6    and the imaginary part has the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we find that equation ( 2 ) looks like the classical continuity equation , and equation ( 1 ) can be reduced to the classical hamilton - jacobi equation if the term @xmath11 was ignored . in bm",
    ", @xmath11 is usually called quantum potential and plays a crucial role for the appearance of quantum phenomena @xcite . from the standpoint of classical mechanics , a bohm - newton equation of motion for a bohmian particle",
    "can be constructed : @xmath12 in fact , according to the definition above , a much simpler equation of motion can be used to obtain quantum trajectory instead of equation ( [ bn ] ) : @xmath13 usually , we first solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation to obtain @xmath5 , and hence @xmath14 .",
    "secondly we integrate equation ( [ dy ] ) to obtain the quantum trajectory of the particle .    statistically , bohm - newton equation is completely equal to schrdinger equation .",
    "all quantum phenomena described by schrdinger equation can be reproduced by bohm - newton equation , in principle , with a properly initial ensemble distribution .",
    "in particular , bohm - newton equation can help us to understand quantum world intuitively from the view of trajectory . in semiclassical method ,",
    "the multiphoton phenomenon of ati can be intuitively explained with the concept of electron trajectory .",
    "therefore , quantum trajectory method is used to study the phenomenon of ati in intense laser - atom physics in this paper .",
    "in this paper , we study the system of hydrogen atom in ilf , using the one - dimensional model atom of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional model , or namely the soft - core model , which has the long - range coulomb tail characteristic of real atomic system , can approximate the system of hydrogen asymptotically .",
    "the hamiltonian of the field - free atom is @xmath15 and the atom - laser interaction is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the laser field profile ( atomic units are used throughout ) . thus the time - dependent schrdinger equation can be obtained @xmath18\\psi(x , t)$ ] . to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation",
    ", we first need to gain the eigenstates and eigenvalues of @xmath19 : @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22 , respectively . here",
    "we construct the eigenstates from the b - spline basis , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the b - spline basis and @xmath25 is the order of b - spline basis @xcite . the range of the variable @xmath26 is confined to @xmath27 . using the standard diagonalization procedure , the eigenvalues @xmath21 and values",
    "@xmath28 are obtained respectively .",
    "secondly , the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath5 is expressed in terms of the eigenstates as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a time - dependent function . in this work",
    "we use symplectic algorithm method @xcite to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation to obtain the coefficient @xmath30 , and hence the wavefunction @xmath5 .    in the present paper ,",
    "the laser field profile is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the amplitude and angular frequency of the electric field in the laser pulse , respectively . here",
    "@xmath35 a.u . and @xmath36 a.u .",
    "and we take : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 a.u . , with the time step of @xmath41 a.u .",
    "the initial state @xmath42 of the system is the ground state of the field - free one - dimensional model atom of hydrogen .",
    "after obtaining the time - dependent wavefunction @xmath5 and the companying @xmath14 , we can numerically integrate equation ( [ dy ] ) to get the quantum trajectory of electron with its initial position @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the different electron trajectories with the corresponding initial positions as functions of time .",
    "let s take the trajectory with the initial position @xmath44 a.u .",
    "as an example : at the first stage before @xmath45 a.u .",
    "about , the electron oscillates around the core , driven by the laser field . after that",
    ", the electron runs away from the core , following a linear line with small periodic oscillation .",
    "this implies that the electron has been ionized , _",
    "i.e. _ , a photoelectron has been ejected from the atom .",
    "we have obtained lots of trajectories of electrons with different initial positions @xmath43 .",
    "all of them have the similar characters as explicitly shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we then calculate the average kinetic energy @xmath46 of each ionized electron in one period of oscillation from its trajectory . because of the long - tail potential of the model atom ,",
    "the energy of the photoelectron is thus obtained @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the long - tail potential of the model atom . in this way",
    ", we have shown the energy of a photoelectron can be obtained directly from the bohm - newton equation . in the traditional semiclassical trajectory methods ,",
    "however , the energy of photoelectron is obtained from a semi - empirical formula @xcite : the total energy of a free electron in the laser field is the sum of the ponderomotive energy and the translational energy : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the electron translational velocity in the laser field .",
    "next , we calculate lots of trajectories of atomic electrons in an ensemble to gain the energies of each photoelectron , and hence the photoelectron spectrum of ati . according to bohmian theory , the initial distribution of atomic electrons in an ensemble is @xmath52 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", @xmath42 is the ground state of the field - free one - dimensional model atom of hydrogen , which is obtained by numerically solving the time - independent schrdinger equation * * : @xmath53**. figure [ fig2 ] explicitly shows the initial density distribution of the electrons .",
    "we have chosen 8,192 initial positions distributed in the range @xmath54 with the distribution density @xmath52 ( note that @xmath55 of atomic electrons in the ensemble is in the range @xmath54 at the time @xmath56 ) and gotten the corresponding trajectories with the propagation time @xmath57",
    ". then we gain the energies of the corresponding photoelectrons by equation ( [ e ] ) . at last , by rearranging these photoelectrons according to their energies , we can gain a photoelectron spectrum of ati , which is shown in figure [ fig3 ] with three peaks at about @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "these peaks are contributed from different quantum trajectories with the corresponding initial electron positions @xmath43 .",
    "generally speaking , the photoelectrons with the initial positions near the core contribute to the first peak and the photoelectrons with the initial positions not near the core have the contribution to the second peak , the third peak , etc .",
    "for example , the photoelectron from the initial position @xmath44 a.u . with the energy @xmath61 contributes to the first peak , and the one from @xmath62 a.u .",
    "with the energy @xmath59 contributes to the second peak .",
    "our result of ati spectrum from bm is consistent with the previous experimental and theoretical results . in experiment ,",
    "the positions of the peaks in a ati spectrum are accurately given by the formula @xmath63 , where @xmath64  is the ground state energy of the field - free atom and @xmath65 is the number of photons absorbed by the atom @xcite .",
    "when @xmath66 but @xmath67 , due to the ac stark shift , the channel for @xmath68-photon absorption is closed and the corresponding peak in the ati spectrum is suppressed , which is called channel closing and has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite . in our work ,",
    "@xmath36 a.u .",
    "and the ground state energy of the model atom is @xmath69 a.u .",
    ", so the peaks should appear at @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "we have also reproduced the ati spectrum by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite . after considering the ponderomotive after - acceleration of electron in ilf @xcite",
    ", we gain the ati spectrum ( the inset in figure [ fig3 ] ) which agrees with that from bm . in this way",
    ", we have shown that the ati spectrum we obtained with bm is consistent with the previous experimental and theoretical results .",
    "it is interesting that bm can well describe the process of ati , in particular after comparing with the application of ctmcm to intense laser - atom physics . in the past",
    ", ctmcm has been used to study the process of ionization of the hydrogen atom in ilf @xcite .",
    "it has been definitely pointed out that ctmcm itself can not give the correct ionization rate , unless an additional tunneling process was considered ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) . in ctmcm ,",
    "motion of the electron is dominated by the classical newton equation . in our calculation , however , bohm - newton equation has been used to gain the trajectory of the electron .",
    "we can thus conclude that the quantum potential @xmath11 in equation ( [ bn ] ) may play a crucial role to reproduce the spectrum of ati in intense laser - atom physics .",
    "in summary , we have used bm to describe the process of ati in intense laser - atom physics . in our study",
    ", the energy of each photoelectron is obtained from bohm - newton equation and the obtained ati spectrum is consistent with the previous theoretical and experimental results . comparing bm with ctmcm",
    ", we conclude that quantum potential may play a key role to depict the quantum phenomenon .",
    "therefore , our work may present a new approach to studying the quantum phenomena in intense laser - atom physics with the image of trajectory .",
