    "it is imperative to observe and characterize a larger sample of galaxies , with a range of morphologies and living in different environments : this has been the motivation for our panoramic imaging survey of centaurus and sculptor ( pisces ) , which we introduce in the next section .",
    "the pisces survey targets two nearby galaxies ( @xmath7  mpc ) : centaurus  a ( cen  a , or ngc  5128 ) , the closest elliptical to us and the dominant galaxy of a dense group of galaxies , and sculptor ( ngc  253 ) , a spiral located in a much looser and elongated group .",
    "sculptor has a mass comparable to our own milky way ( mw ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* karachentsev et al . 2005 ) ) , while cen  a is slightly more massive ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "finally , we perform artificial star tests in order to assess photometric uncertainties and incompleteness for each individual pointing ( this is crucial for all such surveys given the non - uniformity in observing conditions from pointing to pointing ) .    the deep , resolved magellan / megacam images allow us to obtain color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) such as the one shown in fig .",

    "these newly discovered satellites are fainter than the known ones in terms of both absolute magnitude and central surface brightness , see e.g. cena - mm - dw1 and cena - mm - dw2 at @xmath27 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crnojevi et al . 2014 ) ) , or even fainter candidates at @xmath28 ( cena - mm - dw17 ) , @xmath29 ( cena - mm - dw3 ) , @xmath30 ( cena - mm - dw8 ) and @xmath31 ( cena - mm - dw16 ) .",
    "the latter is the remnant of a galaxy caught in the midst of tidal disruption , with stunning tails extending in both directions over 1  deg across the survey footprint ( from e to nw ) .",
    "we stress that cena - mm - dw16 has extreme properties ( very low central surface brightness coupled with large extent ) with respect to lg satellites within the same luminosity range , and proves how sensitive our strategy is to such elusive objects .",
    "a similar potentially disrupting satellite , scl - mm - dw2 , has also been uncovered in the vicinity of sculptor ( ( * ? ? ? * toloba et al . 2015b ) ) .",
    "the pisces survey represents the next observational step in the future of near - field cosmology beyond the lg .",
    "pisces will charachterize in depth the resolved stellar halos of two @xmath1mw - sized galaxies with different morphology and surrounding environments , and their newly discovered faint satellites and substructures .",
    "we have already secured follow - up imaging and spectroscopy of the newly discovered candidate satellites , streams and substructures with a multi - wavelength approach , namely optical with hst , near - infrared with gemini / flamingos2 , co - added spectroscopy ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* toloba et al . 2015a ) ) with both vlt / vimos and keck / deimos .",
    "data have already started to be collected and will be in hand by the beginning of 2017 . this strategy will allow us to derive : the profile , shape and extent of the targets smooth halos and possible gradients in their resolved populations ; the orbital properties of the uncovered streams which will constrain the host halo s mass ; the relative mass contribution from in situ versus accreted stellar components ; the faint end of the satellite luminosity function down to @xmath21 , as well as the star formation histories of the individual satellites discovered through our survey .",
    "our results will be compared to extant wide- and narrow - field surveys of m31 ( pandas ; splash , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gilbert et al .",
    "2012 ) ) and of other nearby galaxies ( e.g. , m81 , ( * ? ? ?",
