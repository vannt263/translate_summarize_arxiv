    "a classical result by higman , neumann and neumann  @xcite states that every countable group imbeds in a finitely generated group .",
    "it was then shown that many properties of the group can be inherited by the imbedding : in particular , solvability ( neumann - neumann  @xcite ) , torsion ( phillips  @xcite ) , residual finiteness ( wilson  @xcite ) , and amenability ( olshansky - osin  @xcite ) .",
    "seen the other way round , these results show that there is little restriction , apart from being countable , on the subgroups of a finitely generated group .    a finitely generated group @xmath0 has _ polynomial growth _ if there is a polynomial function @xmath1 bounding from above the number of group elements that are products of at most @xmath2 generators , has _",
    "subexponential growth _ if @xmath1 may be chosen subexponential in @xmath2 , and has _ intermediate growth _ if @xmath0 has subexponential but not polynomial growth .    by a theorem of gromov",
    "@xcite , groups of polynomial growth are virtually nilpotent , so all its subgroups are finitely generated ( see e.g.  @xcite*corollary  9.10 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are groups of intermediate growth such as the `` first grigorchuk group ''  @xcite with infinitely generated subgroups .",
    "we are therefore led to ask which groups may appear as subgroups of a group of subexponential growth .      let us say that a group has _ locally subexponential growth _ if all of its finitely generated subgroups have subexponential growth . clearly ,",
    "if @xmath0 has subexponential growth then all its subgroups have locally subexponential growth .",
    "our main result shows that this is the only restriction :    [ thm : imbed ] let @xmath3 be a countable group of locally subexponential growth .",
    "then there exists a finitely generated group of subexponential growth in which @xmath3 imbeds as a subgroup .",
    "furthermore , this group may be assumed to have two generators , see remark  [ rem:2gen ] , and to contain @xmath3 in its derived subgroup .",
    "in contrast , there exist nilpotent ( and even abelian ) countable groups that do not imbed into finitely generated nilpotent groups .",
    "gromov s theorem mentioned above has the consequence that there exist countable groups of locally polynomial growth that do not imbed in groups of polynomial growth .",
    "mann noted in  @xcite*corollary  9.11 that torsion - free groups locally of polynomial growth of bounded degree are also virtually nilpotent .",
    "it is a tantalizing open question to understand which properties are shared by groups of intermediate growth and by nilpotent and virtually nilpotent groups .",
    "it is clear that a group of intermediate growth can not contain non - abelian free subgroups or even free subsemigroups .",
    "groups of intermediate growth were constructed by grigorchuk in @xcite , and his first example , known as the `` first grigorchuk group '' , admits a pair of dilating endomorphisms with commuting images .",
    "this property can be viewed as a higher dimensional analogue of groups with dilation ; and any group admitting a dilation has polynomial growth .",
    "we may also ask which groups may appear as subgroups of a specific group of intermediate growth such as the first grigorchuk group @xmath4 .",
    "for example , @xmath4 is known to contain every finite @xmath5-group , and all its subgroups are countable , residually-@xmath5 and have locally smaller growth .",
    "there are other restrictions , apart from these obvious ones , for a countable group to be imbedded as a subgroup of a generalised grigorchuk group .",
    "for example , only a finite number of primes appears as exponents in a grigorchuk group  @xcite ; see also  @xcite*3.6 .",
    "extensions of grigorchuk groups constructed by the authors in  @xcite admit a larger class of possible subgroups , but some restrictions appear nevertheless .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ thm : imbed ] gives the first groups of subexponential growth containing @xmath6 .",
    "the authors are grateful to the anonymous referees for their comments , which helped improve the presentation of the article .",
    "the original imbedding result by higman - neumann - neumann  @xcite mentioned in the introduction proceeds by a sequence of `` hnn extensions '' .",
    "we recall the later construction by neumann - neumann  @xcite , which uses wreath products rather than hnn extensions .",
    "the _ unrestricted _ wreath products of two groups @xmath7 is the group @xmath8 , the split extension of the set of maps @xmath9 by @xmath0 , where the action of @xmath10 on @xmath11 is @xmath12 . the neumann - neumann construction proceeds in two steps :    \\(i ) starting with a countable group @xmath3 , one imbeds it into a countable subgroup @xmath0 of the unrestricted wreath product @xmath13 in such a way that @xmath3 is imbedded into the commutator group @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "the group @xmath0 is generated by @xmath15 and , for all @xmath16 , the function @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 . denoting by @xmath19 the generator of @xmath15",
    ", we see that @xmath20 $ ] is the constant function @xmath21 ; so @xmath3 is in fact imbedded in @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "\\(ii ) starting with a countable group @xmath0 , one imbeds the commutator subgroup @xmath14 $ ] into a two - generated subgroup @xmath23 of the unrestricted wreath product of @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , one constructs imbeddings into @xmath25 for a finitely generated group @xmath26 . denoting a generating set of @xmath0 by @xmath27 , the group @xmath23 is generated by @xmath26 and @xmath28 with @xmath29 along a sparse - enough sequence @xmath30 of elements of @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , since it suffices in  ( i ) to imbed @xmath22 $ ] in @xmath23 , one sets @xmath31 and the exact requirement on the sequence @xmath32 is : @xmath33 for all @xmath34 ; all @xmath35 are distinct ; and @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "one then sees that @xmath38 $ ] is a function supported only at @xmath39 , with value @xmath40 $ ] there .",
    "this is the imbedding of @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the combination of both steps imbeds @xmath3 into the finitely generated group @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath3 is solvable , then so are @xmath13 and @xmath0 ; and similarly , if @xmath0 is solvable , then so are @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "this construction may be applied to an arbitrary countable group @xmath3 , but some properties of @xmath3 , such as amenability , may be lost along the way .",
    "olshansky and osin introduce in  @xcite the following slightly stronger condition on @xmath30 : by definition , a _ parallelogram _ in a sequence @xmath30 is a quadruple of elements @xmath41 , each belonging to @xmath42 , such that @xmath43 .",
    "a sequence is _ parallelogram - free _ if it contains no parallelogram .",
    "they show that , if @xmath32 is parallelogram - free , then the group @xmath23 is obtained from @xmath0 and @xmath26 by extensions , subgroups , quotients and directed limits , so in particular is amenable as soon as @xmath0 and @xmath26 are amenable .",
    "they also modify slightly step  ( i ) , by defining rather @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 ; then @xmath20 $ ] is the function supported at @xmath48 with value @xmath21 there , and the group @xmath49 is also obtained from @xmath3 and @xmath15 by elementary operations , so is amenable as soon as @xmath3 is amenable .",
    "note that the group @xmath23 contains the standard wreath product @xmath50 , so always has exponential growth .",
    "our goal is , starting from a countable group @xmath51 of locally subexponential growth , to construct a finitely generated group @xmath52 of subexponential growth .",
    "we exhibit analogues of steps  ( i ) and  ( ii ) among _ permutational wreath products_. given groups @xmath7 and an action of @xmath0 on a set @xmath53 , the _ unrestricted permutational wreath product _ is @xmath54 , and the _ restricted permutational wreath product _ is the extension of finitely supported functions @xmath55 by @xmath0 .    our previous work  @xcite gives a criterion , in terms of _ inverted orbits _ , that guarantees that the restricted permutational wreath product @xmath56 has subexponential growth as soon as @xmath51 and @xmath0 have subexponential growth .",
    "the inverted orbit of a point @xmath57 under a word @xmath58 in @xmath0 is the set @xmath59 .",

    ". in particular , if @xmath3 has locally subexponential growth , so does @xmath0 .    ad step ( ii ) , we need to consider separately the group @xmath26 and the set @xmath53 on which it acts . as a replacement for parallelogram - free sequences ,",
