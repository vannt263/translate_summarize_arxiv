    "there have been several approaches to coding of geodesics on the hyperbolic plane with respect to fundamental domains of fuchsian groups .",
    "one approach was introduced by morse @xcite , in which the plane is tesselated according to the chosen domain and the action of the group , the sides of the tesselation are labeled in a certain way , and the geodesics are then coded using their intersections with the sides of the tesselation .",
    "another approach was developed by artin @xcite and for coding it uses the endpoints of geodesics on the absolute , which are identified with real numbers and are expanded into continued fractions .",
    "artin s approach was broadened to different types of continued fractions , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and different fuchsian groups ( the original one was used with the modular group ) , @xcite , @xcite , but it requires some reduction process ( i.e. finding an appropriate geodesic among @xmath0-equivalent ones ) before actual encoding . moreover",
    ", the coding process may be defined differently for the same tessellation of the plane , which corresponds to different types of continued fractions .",
    "being more synthetic than morse s , this approach produces a set of sequences of integers , which is a topological markov chain and is much easier to structurize than just a `` random '' set of sequences .",
    "morse s approach utilizes only the way the hyperbolic plane is tiled by fundamental domains of the group , which can be reproduced `` internally '' on the factor surface @xmath1 by marking curves on the surface along which it needs to be `` cut '' to obtain one of the fundamental domains on the plane . and morse s approach is defined uniquely once a tessellation is chosen .",
    "so it is somewhat more natural and canonic than artin s .",
    "we became interested , under what conditions morse s coding produces a set of sequences , which is a topological markov chain too . in @xcite the case of the modular group @xmath5 is considered along with a slightly modified version of the coding , which uses integer numbers instead of the group s elements .",
    "their result implies the results of this paper for the case of the modular group and its standard fundamental domain , and is the primary motivation for this work .",
    "the following definitions provide us with basic terms :    a group of orientation preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane @xmath3 , acting discretely , is called a fuchsian group .    given a fuchsian group @xmath0 , one can consider the factor space @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath0 acts discretely on @xmath3 , the space is an orbifold .",
    "if the volume of the factor surface @xmath1 is finite , the group is said to have a finite covolume .",
    "let @xmath0 be a fuchsian group , and let @xmath6 be a point which is not fixed by any element of @xmath0 except the identity .",
    "then the dirichlet domain of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath7 is the set @xmath8 .",
    "a dirichlet domain of a fuchsian group is a fundamental domain of the group , @xcite , and is a convex polygonal set on the union of the hyperbolic plane and its boundary at infinity .",
    "siegel ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1.1 ) tells us , that if the group has a finite covolume , the number of edges of a dirichlet domain is finite .",
    "clearly , a dirichlet domain of a group with a finite covolume has no edges on @xmath9 . in terms of the factor surface @xmath1",
    ", it may have a finite number of singular points and cusps , but can not have funnels .",
    "* given a fuchsian group @xmath0 and its dirichlet domain @xmath4 , we will refer to the edges and vertices of the tessellation @xmath10 as just `` edges '' and `` vertices '' , because there are no edges or vertices considered in this paper other than those .",
    "* we will call the vertices on @xmath9 `` infinite '' and all the others  `` finite '' . *",
    "the geodesics are always directed .",
    "then referring to the left and right hand side of the plane with respect to a given geodesic makes sense .",
    "if one geodesic crosses another one , we will say it is on the right from the other one , if its direction is from the left to the right , otherwise we will say it is on the left from the other one .",
    "clearly , if one geodesic is on the right from another one , then the latter one is on the left from the former one and vice versa .",
    "consider a fuchsian group @xmath0 along with a dirichlet domain @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 shares its edges with some of its images ( `` copies '' ) under the action of @xmath0 .",
    "let the images , sharing edges with @xmath4 , be @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "let us label the edges of @xmath4 by the elements @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 , so that the edge shared with @xmath17 is labeled by @xmath18 .",
    "this labeling is made inside the domain .",
    "now we spread this labeling to the rest of the tessellation : for every @xmath19 the edge of @xmath20 , corresponding to the one labeled by @xmath18 inside @xmath4 , is labeled by @xmath18 inside @xmath20 .",

    "it is easy to show , that each edge is labeled by elements inverse to each other from opposite sides .",
    "a generic geodesic on the hyperbolic plane avoids the vertices , finite or infinite .",
    "given a generic geodesic , one can write down the biinfinite sequence of labels on the edges , which the geodesic crosses on its way ( each time the geodesic crosses an edge , one writes down the label on the edge from the domain the geodesic is leaving ) .",
    "this sequence is called the geodesic s cutting sequence .",
    "it was used by morse in his paper @xcite , and is also referred to as ( geometric ) morse code of the geodesic . according to @xcite ,",
    "it can be traced back to @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see from the geometric construction , that in the cutting sequence of a geodesic , an entry can not be immediately followed by its inverse from @xmath0 .",
    "this fact follows from two observations : that every label is unique inside one domain , and that a geodesic can not cross the same edge twice in a row .",
    "we consider the set of cutting sequences of all generic geodesics on @xmath3 with respect to a given dirichlet domain @xmath4 .",

    "let @xmath32 be a set of biinfinite sequences of elements of @xmath31 .",

    "the proof of sufficiency is essentially contained in ( * ? ? ? * , pp .",

    "every infinite sequence consisting of @xmath14 , @xmath12 , @xmath15 will then correspond to a branch of the tree , starting at the root , and a point on @xmath9 .",
    "every biinfinite sequence will correspond to two points on @xmath9 and , thus , to a geodesic .",
    "one only needs to check this geodesic s cutting sequence coincides with the original biinfinite sequence .",
