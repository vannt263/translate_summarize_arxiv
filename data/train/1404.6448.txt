    "advances in electronics , computer aided engineering , manufacturing and material technology had a great impact on machine design .",
    "a good example is the development of fighter jets that spans seven decades and started with propeller machines that were upgraded with simple jet engines .",
    "in contrast , forthcoming fighter jets are unmanned flying wings with stealth properties and advanced electronics , figure  [ pic : figure_1_1 ] .",
    "improvements in the aerodynamic design were mostly driven by the rapid development of computers that allowed the use of unstable designs .",
    "the relaxation of aerodynamic design constraints is continued by the current shift towards unmanned aircraft .",
    "in contrast , changes in the structural design were not as radical .",
    "for example , control surfaces are still rigid bodies that require gaps in an aircrafts skin and thus create a source of radar reflections .",
    "this is a limiting factor as aircraft become increasingly stealthy .",
    "a remedy would be the use of adaptive structures that eliminate these gaps and additionally expand the optimal flight regime .",
    "an overview of potential technologies for adaptive structures can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that the applicability of adaptive structures is by no means limited to aircraft .",
    "other application areas are , for example , architectural elements such as seats and couches .",
    "kinematic mechanisms are the backbone of adaptive structures .",
    "different design principles for a directly actuated , single degree of freedom mechanism are shown in figure  [ pic : figure_1_2 ] .",
    "both , a compliant and rigid body actuator , structure are considered .",
    "advantages of compliant actuators , structures are the reduced number of parts as well as the lack of backlash , friction and wear . on the other hand ,",
    "these advantages come at the cost of an increased design complexity since elastic stresses and fatigue have to be considered .",
    "hence , possible rotation angels are limited .",
    "most actuators possess only a single degree of freedom .",
    "this often causes a kinematic incompatibility between mechanism and actuators which prevents a complete fusion between actuators and structure .",
    "nastic plants are an exception insofar that there exists no separation between actuators and structure  @xcite .",
    "they are made from a large number of cells whose geometry , internal pressures and material properties are tailored for a given set of target shapes and stiffness requirements  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a synergistic effect since cell pressures introduce a prestress into the structure which increases , decreases the overall stiffness , weight .",
    "compliant pressure actuated cellular structures with fixed properties can be made from single materials that range from elastomers to metals  @xcite .",
    "this allows the use of advanced manufacturing techniques such as injection molding or rapid prototyping .",
    "the choice of cell materials affects cell sizes and thus the required cell pressures .",
    "hence it is possible to design cellular structures for a wide pressure range .",
    "the need for _ advanced aircraft designs _ is one of the driving forces behind research on plant inspired adaptive structures .",
    "although not directly related to adaptive structures , khire et al .",
    "@xcite published an interesting article about inflatable structures that consist of a large number of uniformly pressurized hexagonal cells with a regular , prismatic geometry .",
    "vos et al .",
    "@xcite subsequently published and patented a similar concept .",
    "they combine a large number of regular , prismatic cells with an elastic plate such that its deformation state depends on cell pressures .",
    "inspired by the fibrillar network in plant cell walls , philen et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a concept for smart materials that are based on a large number of pressurized artificial muscles  @xcite .",
    "vasista and tong  @xcite used topology optimization to compute cell geometries for desired deformations of an adaptive structure .",
    "a summary of recent work in this field that was supported by the defense advanced research agency , national science foundation and the united states army can be found in the book edited by wereley and sater  @xcite .",
    "another driving force is the emerging field of _ soft robotics_. most actuators for soft robots are made from a single row of regular cells that are not optimized for any target shape  @xcite .",
    "hence , materials that can undergo large elastic strains are used to compensate for the simple cell geometries . these kind of structures can be considered to be a special case of  @xcite . a modular approach to soft robotics that is based on regular ,",
    "single row actuators was published by onal and rus  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this article is to introduce pressure actuated cellular modules that consist of two optimized cell rows and connectors at both ends ( section  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , it is shown how cytoskeletons can be used to decrease , increase the weight , stiffness of adaptive modules .",
    "an algorithm that breaks down any continuous target shapes into a set of modules is presented ( section  3 ) .",
    "it is shown that a small number of adaptive , mechanical and rigid modules can be used to construct adaptive structures such as airfoils and passenger seats ( section  4 ) .",
    "pressure actuated cellular structures are usually purpose made for a given set of target shapes , cell pressures and stiffness requirements .",
    "hence it is necessary to go through the whole design and manufacturing process for every prototype .",
    "such a procedure is time consuming and expensive .",
    "costs during the initial prototyping phase can be reduced by using a modular approach .",
    "a sketch of two different adaptive modules is shown in figure  [ pic : figure_2_1 ] .",
    "it can be seen that a module consists of two cell rows and connectors at both ends that enable an arbitrary combination of modules .",
    "furthermore , the space between adjacent hexagons is filled with a flexible foam to obtain a smooth inner surface .",
    "it is subsequently assumed that equilibrium shapes of adaptive modules are circular arcs .",
    "this choice is motivated by the fact that , apart of edge effects , regular cellular structures deform into circular arcs .",
    "hence , cell side lengths and rotation angles at cell corners are more uniform across a module .",
    "the used notation for a single adaptive module is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the arc length and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the central angles of the lower , upper limit shape .",
    "note that an adaptive module can continuously change its shape between both limit shapes by altering the pressure ratio between cell rows .",
    "adaptive modules with a given arc length can be designed for arbitrary limit angles .",
    "however , the shape changing capability @xmath5 of a module is proportional to the required minimum number of cells .",
    "therefore , the module stiffness is inversely proportional to the shape changing capability since the module thickness is inversely proportional to the number of cells .",
    "the proposed concept for pressure actuated cellular structures mimics the nastic movement of plants by combining rows of prismatic cells with tailored cell side lengths and thicknesses .",
    "the overall weight and stiffness of these structures can be further improved by using cytoskeletons .",
    "a similar approach can be found in nature .",
    "for example , the shape of eukaryotic cells is determined by cytoskeletons .",
    "ingber  @xcite showed that the complex structure of cytoskeletons might be explained on the basis of tensegrity structures  @xcite .",
    "his main argument is that local remodeling phenomena of cytoskeletons must be seen in a global , cellular context . in order to simplify matters , two different kind of cytoskeletons are subsequently considered .",
    "the first kind of cytoskeletons limits the deformability of cells .",
    "this is achieved with an internal structure that can carry large tensile and only minor compressive forces .",
    "hence , these cytoskeletons are , depending on the deformation states of cells , either slack or taut .",
    "three different versions of an adaptive module with identical cell geometries are considered as illustrated in figure  [ pic : figure_2_2 ] .",
    "the first version lacks any cytoskeletons and possesses a shape changing capability of @xmath6 .",
    "the second version possesses an identical shape changing capability and cytoskeletons that restrain module deformations beyond limit shapes .",
    "the third version possesses cytoskeletons that are partially stressed at both limit shapes .",
    "this is achieved by reducing the shape changing capability from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that cytoskeleton lengths are computed for certain cell pressures that approximately result in desired central angles .",
    "hence , their lengths vary slightly along an adaptive module due to edge effects .",
    "this is the reason why only average cytoskeleton lengths are given in figure  [ pic : figure_2_2 ] .",
    "the elastic energy of cellular structures can be neglected if frictionless cell corner hinges and stiff cell sides are assumed .",
    "such a simplification minimizes influence factors and maximizes the verifiability of presented results .",
    "therefore , frictionless cell corner hinges and a relatively large axial stiffness of @xmath8  gn are assumed for both cell sides and cytoskeletons .",
    "it is important to note that these assumptions do not considerably affect the performance of the considered cellular structures .",
    "central angle changes due to end moments at both limit shapes are shown in figure  [ pic : figure_2_3 ] for all three module versions .",
    "it can be seen that a module without cytoskeletons possesses , depending on cell pressures , a stiffness between @xmath9/knm .",
    "this corresponds to the stiffness of a steel plate with a thickness between 5 - 8  mm .",
    "introducing cytoskeletons restrains module deformations beyond limit shapes .",
    "furthermore , the module stiffness at both limit shapes increases to @xmath10/knm for loads between 0.5 - 2.0  knm if cytoskeletons are partially prestressed .",
    "this corresponds to the stiffness of a steel plate with a thickness between 31 - 39  mm .",
    "it should be noted that the stiffness of cytoskeletons does not affect the stiffness gain shown in figure  [ pic : figure_2_3 ] .",
    "however , it does affect the tangent in that region .",
    "furthermore , cytoskeletons are relatively thin and thus lightweight since their axial forces are well below the axial forces found in cell sides .",
    "the second kind of cytoskeletons reduces pressure induced bending moments in cell sides and thus the overall weight of a cellular structure .",
    "this is achieved by providing additional supports along a cell side as illustrated in figure  [ pic : figure_2_4 ] .",
    "two levels of cytoskeletons that provide load paths between pressure loaded cell sides are shown in figure  [ pic : figure_2_5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that cytoskeletons form four - bar linkages that do not restrain cell deformations .",
    "possible weight reductions for various materials are summarized in table  [ tab : weight ] .",
    "note that a weight reduction of up to 36% is possible with a single level of cytoskeletons .",
    "more levels of cytoskeletons or the use of optimized cytoskeletons would further reduce the overall weight .",
    "hence , the computed weight savings are a lower bound ."
