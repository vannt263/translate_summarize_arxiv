    "the compound series _ _ lntpn__o ( @xmath0 : lanthanides , @xmath10 : transition metal , @xmath1 : p or as ) have started to attract considerable attention because of the recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature @xmath11 exceeding 50k in the @xmath0feaso@xmath2f@xmath3 series of compounds @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , being the highest @xmath11 except for cuprate systems . while the recent reports focus on the importance of electronic correlation effects due to @xmath6-electrons close to a magnetic state , the homologous compounds with @xmath0 = ce are attractive candidates for strong correlation effects induced by the @xmath12-electrons .",
    "thus , last year we presented a detailed study of the properties of cerupo and ceospo @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and demonstrated that the former one is a rare example for a ferromagnetic ( fm ) kondo lattice system with a fm ordering temperature @xmath13k and a kondo temperature @xmath14k , while the latter one shows antiferromagnetic order of stable trivalent ce - ions below @xmath15k .",
    "more recently , we have shown that cefepo is a heavy fermion metal close to a fm instability , dominated by the magnetism of the @xmath12-electrons @xcite . therefore , it was natural to look also for the physical properties of the related compound with @xmath10 = co.    in this report , we present a first study of the basic physical properties of cecopo using susceptibility @xmath16 , specific heat @xmath17 , and resistivity @xmath18 measurements as well as x - ray absorption near - edge spectroscopy structure ( xanes ) at the ce @xmath19 edge",
    ". the results reveal a fm ordering of the co - ions at @xmath5k in analogy to the fm order at 43k in lacopo @xcite .",
    "an enhanced sommerfeld - coefficient of @xmath8mj / molk@xmath9 and the temperature dependence of the resistivity reveal a finite kondo scale of the @xmath12-moments of order @xmath20k .",
    "in addition , we confirm the reported data of the magnetic properties of polycrystalline lacopo .",
    "polycrystalline samples of cecopo and lacopo were synthesized using a sn - flux method in evacuated quartz tubes as described elsewhere @xcite , @xcite .",
    "several powder x - ray diffraction patterns recorded on a stoe diffractometer in transmission mode using monochromated cu - k@xmath21 radiation ( @xmath22 ) confirmed the formation of @xmath0copo with zrcusias structure type ( space group : @xmath23 ; @xmath24 ) .",
    "the lattice parameters refined by simple least square fitting for cecopo @xmath25 , @xmath26 and lacopo @xmath27 , @xmath28 were found to be in good agreement with the reported structure data @xcite , @xcite . in addition",
    ", energy dispersive x - ray spectra of cecopo and lacopo performed on a scanning electron microscope ( philips xl30 ) with si(li)-x - ray detector show similar strong intensities of the oxygen line which confirm a substantial oxygen content of both phases .",
    "however , they revealed diamagnetic cop@xmath29 @xcite as impurity phase and some oxide phases which are present only with small concentration , so that they could not be observed in the x - ray diffraction patterns .",
    "@xmath16 measurements were performed in the temperature range @xmath30k in a commercial quantum design ( qd ) magnetic property measurement system ( mpms ) , the @xmath10-dependent measurements were performed after zero - field cooling the sample .",
    "the resistivity was determined down to 0.4k using a standard ac four - probe geometry in a qd physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "the ppms was also used to measure @xmath17 with a standard heat - pulse relaxation technique .",
    "xanes - spectra near the ce @xmath19 edge were taken at 300k in transmission geometry at the exafs beamline a1 of hasylab at desy , germany .",
    "the wavelength selection was realized by means of si(111 ) double crystal monochromator , which allowed an experimental resolution of approximately 2ev ( fwhm ) at the ce @xmath19 threshold of 5723ev .",
    "t. both compounds show similar curie - weiss behavior above 230k with @xmath4 and @xmath31k ( straight line ) .",
    "inset : the magnetization of cecopo presents a small hysteresis at small magnetic fields and a nearly saturated moment at higher fields.,width=377 ]    in fig .  [ figchi1 ] the inverse susceptibility is shown for both cecopo and lacopo . above",
    "230k both curves present similar curie - weiss behavior with an effective moment of @xmath4 and a weiss temperature of @xmath31k .",
    "our results for lacopo are very similar to those of ref .  @xcite but important to analyze the magnetism in cecopo",
    ". the identical behavior of cecopo and lacopo in @xmath32 evidences that in both compounds the main contribution to the magnetism results from the @xmath6-electrons of co. however , in cecopo the ce - ions are not completely unmagnetic as will be discussed later . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figchi1 ] , the magnetization @xmath33 of cecopo is shown .",
    "@xmath33 presents a small hysteresis at low field and a saturated moment of @xmath34 at @xmath35 t , similar to what was observed in lacopo @xcite . at higher fields",
    ", @xmath33 increases further slightly which might be due to the paramagnetism of the ce - ions .    in fig .",
    "[ figchi ] , we present @xmath16 of cecopo as a function of temperature at three different magnetic fields . the transition into a fm ordered state",
    "is visible by a sharp increase at @xmath36k and a strong field dependence of @xmath37 at low @xmath10 .",
    "however , the peak at @xmath38 observed in low fields ( @xmath39 t ) does not correspond to the expectation for a simple ferromagnet .",
    "presently , it is not settled whether this is the result of measuring powder samples of a system with a complex anisotropic behavior or if it points to a more intricate magnetic structure with polarization effects on the ce - ions by the internal magnetic fields of the co - magnetism .",
    "the later scenario is more likely , because the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath37 for lacopo ( line in fig .",
    "[ figchi ] ) , where no @xmath12-electrons are present , behaves as expected for a simple ferromagnet .",
    "of cecopo at various magnetic fields . the magnetic transition into a fm ordered state",
    "is visible at @xmath5k . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath16 for lacopo at @xmath40 t is presented as well ( straight line).,width=377 ]    the temperature dependence of the specific heat of cecopo is shown in fig .",
    "[ fighc ] without any subtraction of the phonons .",
    "therefore , at high @xmath10 , @xmath17 converges to the classical limit of @xmath41j / molk .",
    "an anomaly is visible on top of the phonon excitations just below @xmath38 .",
    "this anomaly is rather broad , possibly due to inhomogeneities in our polycrystalline sample . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fighc ] we have plotted the specific heat as @xmath42 on a logarithmic temperature scale . in this representation",
    "the peak due to the onset of fm order is more pronounced .",
    "below @xmath43k , @xmath42 increases logarithmically and tends to saturate below @xmath44k at @xmath45mj / molk@xmath9 .",
    "this value is strongly enhanced compared to the expectation for a normal fm co - system .",
    "this enhancement can be attributed to @xmath12-correlation effects resulting in the formation of heavy fermions .",
    "the entropy at low @xmath10 was calculated by integrating @xmath42 over temperature .",
    "the entropy gain at 10k corresponds to about 25% of @xmath46 , giving a rough estimation of the kondo energy scale of order @xmath7k . for the calculation",
    ", we have not subtracted any nonmagnetic contribution which for @xmath47k is negligible compared to the large value of @xmath42 . as an example , the contribution of the nonmagnetic larupo to the specific heat at @xmath48k would only correspond to 2% of the here measured specific heat @xcite .     due to the fm order of cecopo .",
    "the inset shows the specific heat plotted as @xmath42 on a logarithmic temperature scale . below @xmath43k , @xmath42 of cecopo",
    "increases logarithmically down to lower @xmath10 , presenting an enhanced @xmath45mj / molk@xmath9 at 0.35k.,width=377 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figrho ] we present the resistivity data on a pressed powder - pellet of cecopo which was subsequently annealed for 150 hours at 700@xmath49c , improving the conductivity of the sample by a factor of 20 .",
    "however , the absolute value of @xmath50m@xmath51 cm is still rather high ; we believe that this is not intrinsic of cecopo but due to the remaining granularity of the polycrystalline sample . to compare our results with @xmath18 of lacopo from yanagi _ et al .",
    "_ , we have normalized our data to @xmath52 . from fig .",
    "[ figrho ] it is obvious that @xmath18 of cecopo differs significantly from the data of lacopo which decreases linearly with temperature with a small change in slope at the fm ordering temperature .",
    "in contrast , cecopo shows linear metallic behavior only above 100k , followed by a pronounced decrease which is a distinct feature of a kondo lattice system .",
    "however , we can not exclude that this decrease is due to reduced spin - spin scattering because of the fm order at @xmath38 , as both energy scales ( @xmath7k and @xmath5k ) are comparable .",
    "thermopower measurements on cecopo would be desirable to distinguish between both effects .",
    "we have performed xanes measurements at the ce@xmath53 edge to determine the valency of the ce - ions to gain a deeper insight of the relevance of cerium to the magnetic behavior in cecopo . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figxas ] we have plotted the evolution of the tetragonal unit cell volume @xmath54 for the three @xmath55po series ( @xmath56co , fe , ru ) . the contraction of @xmath54 is typical for the @xmath0 series , and a smooth evolution is expected if ce is in a trivalent state .",
    "therefore , one would expect a stable , magnetic ce@xmath53 in cerupo but a stronger tendency to intermediate - valent ce - ions in cefepo and cecopo @xcite .",
    "this trend is confirmed in our xanes spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ figxas ] .",
    "all three spectra are quite close to each other indicating , that the valency of ce is not changing dramatically when going from ru- to the co - compound . above 5.73kev , the co - compound show a slightly higher intensity compared to cerupo , but far away from the double - peak behavior in the formal pure ce@xmath57-system ceo@xmath29 @xcite . from this",
    "we conclude a predominantly ce@xmath53 for all three systems .",
    "preliminary x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) measurements on cecopo confirm this result showing that more than 90% of the ce - ions are in the @xmath58 configuration @xcite .",
    "m@xmath51 cm . for comparison , @xmath18 of lacopo taken from yanagi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is shown ( straight line).,width=377 ]",
    "our results on cecopo evidence three interesting features which shall now be discussed : the interplay of the @xmath6 and @xmath12 magnetism , the comparison with the results obtained on cerupo and cefepo , and the relation to the new high temperature superconductors @xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2f@xmath3 .",
    "the presented results point to a fm ordering of the co - ions in cecopo similar to the fm order in lacopo @xcite ; however , the unusual temperature dependence of @xmath16 at @xmath38 together with an increasing magnetization for fields @xmath59 t are not expected for a simple fm and not observed in lacopo . on the other hand , the xanes spectra suggest the ce - ions to be close to trivalent which is in agreement with the enhanced @xmath60 , and the temperature dependence of @xmath18 which are typical for pronounced kondo - interactions .",
    "therefore , we suggest the following scenario for cecopo . the spins of the co - ions ( @xmath6-electrons ) order ferromagnetically at @xmath5k , the resulting internal fields partially polarize the ce - ions ( @xmath12-electrons ) , which however remain also partially fluctuating down to lowest measured temperatures .",
    "one could even imagine that a kondo screening increasing with decreasing temperature lead to a decreasing ce - polarization with temperature . in order to get a deeper insight into the many - body phenomena in this compound",
    ", a more microscopic local probe should be used to study the magnetism .",
    "we therefore , started an investigation of cecopo with xmcd @xcite as well as @xmath61p nmr and @xmath62co nmr @xcite to distinguish between @xmath6 and @xmath12 magnetism .",
    "the doniach picture can be used to classify the ce@xmath10po series with respect to the magnetism of the @xmath12-electrons @xcite . from the inset of fig .",
    "[ figxas ] it is evident that the volume of the unit cell decreases from @xmath10=ru to fe and further to co. with decreasing @xmath54 the magnetism of the ce - ions becomes more and more screened by the conduction electrons because of an increasing kondo energy scale .",
    "accordingly , we observe stable ferromagnetism of the ce - ions in cerupo @xcite which has the largest @xmath63nm@xmath64 .",
    "cefepo has a smaller @xmath65nm@xmath64 and is close but already on the nonmangetic side of a fm instability @xcite .",
    "the volume related suppression of the magnetic order can also be observed in pressure experiments on single crystals of cerupo @xcite .",
    "our conclusion of a larger screening of the @xmath12 electrons as identified by a higher kondo temperature @xmath7k in cecopo is in nice continuation of this systematic trend since this compound has a further reduced volume @xmath66nm@xmath64 compared to cefepo .",
    "edge of cetpo ( t = co , fe , ru ) taken on powdered samples at @xmath67k .",
    "the data are normalized to 1 at 5.755kev .",
    "inset : cell volumes of the tetragonal phosphide oxides @xmath55po @xcite , @xcite.,width=377 ]    the superconductivity at @xmath68k in f - doped lafeaso came as a big surprise @xcite and subsequently research on these systems reveals systems with @xmath11 s exceeding 50k in the elements with heavier @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the connection between a vanishing magnetic transition and the simultaneous formation of a superconducting state is reminiscent of the behavior in the cuprates and in the heavy fermion systems , and therefore suggests the superconducting state in these doped rfeaso systems to be of unconventional nature , too . in cecopo",
    ", we could not observe superconductivity down to 350mk , which is not so much surprising taking into account the fm co - state .",
    "the magnetism might be easy to suppress either by doping or pressure , because an ordering temperature of @xmath5k is rather low for co - ordering .",
    "further research has to answer the question whether superconductivity appears in this compound after suppression of the fm order .",
    "in summary , we have shown that cecopo presents ferromagnetic order of the co - ions at @xmath5k .",
    "the @xmath12-electrons are screened due to pronounced kondo - interactions with a kondo energy scale of order @xmath7k revealed by the temperature dependence of the resistivity and an enhanced sommerfeld - coefficient @xmath8mj / molk@xmath9 .",
    "in addition , we confirm the fm order in lacopo at @xmath69k .",
