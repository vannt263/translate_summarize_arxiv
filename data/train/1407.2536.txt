    "recently , icecube ( ic ) reports the detections of two pev neutrinos @xcite and 26 sub - pev additional events @xcite within two years operation of ic-79 and ic-86 . in comparison with the expected number of 10.6 events from atmospheric muons and neutrinos , the observed flux corresponds to an excess with a signification of @xmath4 @xcite",
    "this may mark the first detection of high energy ( @xmath5 tev ) extraterrestrial neutrinos .",
    "later on the three years of ic data improve the signification up to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these neutrinos are consistent with a flat energy spectrum , equal flavor ratio of 1:1:1 and isotropic sky distribution .",
    "the single flavor intensity of these extraterrestrial neutrinos is @xmath7 corresponding to a @xmath8 all sky integrated flux of @xmath9 from 60 tev to 3 pev energy range , and there is a lack of detected @xmath5 2 pev neutrinos .",
    "there are many scenarios that have been discussed regarding the origin of these extraterrestrial neutrinos , both galactic and extragalactic models .",
    "the galactic origins include the point source contribution @xcite , and extended and diffuse sources due to galactic cosmic ray ( cr ) interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) during their propagation @xcite .",
    "@xcite even propose the diffuse neutrinos from an extended galactic halo . by assuming galactic origin ,",
    "the ic detected neutrinos have been used to constrain the galactic cr sources @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , extragalactic sources , e.g. , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite , and star forming galaxies @xcite have been discussed , as well as extragalactic diffuse neutrinos due to cr propagation in cosmic background photons @xcite .",
    "the ic detection , assuming extragalactic origin , has been used to constrain the extragalactic cr source physics , e.g. , the cr spectrum @xcite , the production rate density @xcite , and the physical condition of the cr accelerators @xcite .",
    "the -large area telescope ( lat ) provides a survey of the @xmath10-ray sky from @xmath11 mev to several hundred gev with a sensitivity more than an order of magnitudes surpassing its predecessor egret .",
    "many more point sources , as well as more precise diffuse @xmath10-ray background , have been detected by lat .",
    "the -gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) complements the lat in its observations of transient sources , especially gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in this paper",
    "we will use the @xmath10-ray observations of -lat and gbm to constrain the galactic and extragalactic origins of the ic detected neutrinos , by assuming the @xmath10-ray and neutrino connection and extrapolation of the @xmath10-ray spectra .",
    "the organization of the paper is as following . in section [ mw ]",
    "we discuss the galactic models , including the diffuse neutrino emission from cr interactions with ism and extended halo matter ( section 2.1 ) and the neutrinos from galactic point sources ( section 2.2 ) .",
    "our constraint does not favor these galactic sources . in section [ xg ]",
    ", we discuss the extragalactic model , especially the grb neutrino model . combining with the lat constraints of triggered grbs",
    ", we do not favor grb model either ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "we further propose that extragalactic neutrinos from agn jets ( section 3.2 ) and sfgs ( section 3.3 ) may be the possible source of ic neutrinos ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "finally section [ discussion ] is conclusion and discussion .",
    "the first question we need to ask about the ic detected neutrinos is whether they can be produced in the milky way ( mw ) , including the contribution by point sources and the diffuse neutrinos from cr propagation . here",
    "we will derive the neutrino flux by extrapolation of the @xmath10-ray spectrum from -lat observations , and then compare it with the ic detected flux .",
    "both @xmath10-rays and neutrinos can be produced by the interactions between cr particles and medium matter ( @xmath0 ) or background photons ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we can simply consider only @xmath0 interactions and neglect @xmath1 because the background photons are relatively rare and @xmath1 time scale is much longer than @xmath0 collisions .    in the case of @xmath0 collisions ,",
    "the flux ratio of @xmath12 s , @xmath13 s and @xmath14 s is @xmath15 at high energies .",
    "neutrinos are produced via charged pion s decay : @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "each neutrino carries one quarter of the pion s energy .",
    "photons are produced via neutral pion s decay , @xmath18 , and each photon carries one half of pion s energy .",
    "the flavor ratio of the produced neutrinos is @xmath19 , and after oscillation the flavor ratio detected on earth becomes @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the number ratio of @xmath10-rays and each flavor of neutrinos generated via the processes above is @xmath21 , so the relation between the detected fluxes of diffuse @xmath14-decay @xmath10 rays and single flavor neutrinos at energies @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) is @xmath26 note that we neglect any attenuation of the @xmath10-rays below 100 gev , which we use , in the sources and during propagation .",
    ".the @xmath10-ray flux at 100gev in different galactic regions observed by -lat . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    a significant fraction of the uss may be galactic other than extragalactic sources .",
    "we estimate the contribution of those uss that are of galactic origin to the @xmath10-ray flux on earth .    according to 2fgl ,",
    "we show the galactic latitude distribution of @xmath10-ray flux of identified galactic sources and uss at @xmath27  gev in fig .",
    "the us distribution consists of galactic and extragalactic components .",
    "we assume that the galactic latitude distribution of the galactic uss follows the same shape of the identified galactic sources , and that the extragalactic one is isotropically distributed .",
    "we should subtract the isotropic extragalactic component from the total us flux to obtain the flux of galactic uss . by comparing the latitude distributions of the identified galactic sources and the uss",
    ", we can find that the emission at @xmath28 is dominated by extragalactic component . subtracting an isotropic background flux to all the @xmath29 bins ,",
    "the expected contribution of uss to the galactic point source flux is @xmath30 at @xmath27  gev .",
    "so the total @xmath10-ray flux of all galactic point sources ( including identified sources and uss ) is @xmath31 . with eq . , the neutrino flux at @xmath32  gev is @xmath33 .",
    "+    we assume that the neutrino spectrum is flat @xmath34 .",
    "this may be an optimistic estimate of the neutrino flux because cr spectrum is expected to be flat in a strong shock , and the secondary @xmath10-ray and neutrino spectra follow the cr spectrum .",
    "so the expected pev neutrino flux from galactic point sources is @xmath35 not larger than the ic excess .    following the discussion by @xcite ( their section 5.4 ) , the contribution of uss to the galactic source neutrino flux can be even lower , and the above conclusion may be more robust : ( 1 ) despite the flux of uss increases sharply in galactic plane , it is attributable to the relative lack of sources at @xmath36 in many of the extragalactic source catalogs used for source identification ; ( 2 ) the uss in galactic plane with curved spectra tend to cluster in bright galactic diffuse emission regions , suggesting that at least a fraction of them may be dge maxima , that are not adequately modeled by dge model ; ( 3 ) some uss may be unreal because there are much more fraction ( 51% ) of uss with doubt being a source in contrast to the fraction of identified sources ( 14% ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath10-ray flux may be dominated by electron emission , other than @xmath0 interactions . in conclusion , the flux of pev neutrinos from galactic point sources may be far below that in equation ( [ eq : gps ] ) , and may not reach the ic excess flux .",
    "since galactic origins of ic neutrinos are not favored , we turn to discuss the extragalactic origin .",
    "the scenario that the ic neutrinos are cosmogenic neutrinos produced via @xmath1 interactions between cr particles and cosmic background photons is disfavored , because normalizing the expected neutrino flux to that observed by ic at 1  pev leads to an over predicted neutrino flux at eev range @xcite .",
    "we discuss the other extragalactic neutrinos sources below , i.e. , grbs , agn jets , and starburst galaxies ( sbgs ) .",
    "grbs have long been proposed to be a strong candidate of the source of ultrahigh energy ( uhe ) crs @xcite , and the @xmath1 collisions are expected to produce intense neutrino emission around pev range @xcite , consistent with the current ic constraint on the neutrino spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to check whether grb neutrinos can account for the ic diffuse neutrinos . in the following , assuming first that grbs are the ic neutrino source",
    ", we estimate the average neutrino flux of a triggered grb , which should be compared to the upper limit ic puts on the triggered grbs . by doing this",
    ", we should assume that _ the neutrino flux from a grb is proportional to the mev - range flux .",
    "_    for a @xmath10-ray detector monitoring the whole sky with a sensitivity of @xmath37 , the grb trigger rate is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the redshift dependence of grb rate density , @xmath40 is the grb luminosity function , @xmath41 is the grb luminosity distance , @xmath42 is the volume - redshift relation of the universe , and @xmath43 corresponds to @xmath44-correction , depending on grb spectrum and detector energy range ( see below ) . the ( time averaged ) @xmath10-ray flux from triggered grbs is @xmath45 whereas the total one , including the contribution from untriggered grbs is @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the grb energy , for which we simply assume @xmath48 .",
    "recently the grb rate density and luminosity function have been well constrained by using the large sample of _ swift _ grbs with redshift measurement @xcite : @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is defined such that @xmath59 . for -gbm",
    "the threshold is @xmath60 in the energy range of 50 - 300 kev @xcite . in this case",
    "we write @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the grb spectrum in the rest frame , for which we assume a broken power law with photon indices of @xmath63 and @xmath64 and a sharp break at @xmath65 kev",
    ". we will take @xmath66 and assume a flat @xmath67cdm universe with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the gbm trigger threshold is @xmath71 0.71 photons @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "there were 183 grbs triggered between 2008 july 11 and 2009 march 31 , corresponding to a grb trigger rate of @xmath73 burst @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "taking into account the earth occultation and the south atlantic anomaly passage , only 65% of grbs above the gbm threshold can be detected @xcite .",
    "so for a detector monitoring all sky with the gbm threshold , the trigger rate should be @xmath75 . on the other hand , if @xmath710.7 , 0.5 , and 0.3 photons @xmath76 , we can calculate with the above formula that @xmath77220 , 306 , and 480 @xmath78 , and @xmath790.71 , 0.75 , and 0.8 , respectively . to obtain the gbm trigger rate",
    "@xmath80 one needs @xmath81 photons @xmath72 .",
    "taking @xmath82 yr@xmath83 and @xmath84 , if grbs can account for the ic neutrino flux @xmath85gev@xmath86s@xmath83 ( @xmath8 integrated and single flavor ) , the average neutrino fluence of a gbm - triggered grb is required to be @xmath87 the @xmath1 interactions produce not only neutrinos but also @xmath10-rays , which generate electromagnetic cascade emission in gev energy range , which can be observed by -lat . using the neutrino and @xmath10-ray connection , the -lat observations of grbs help to constrain that the average neutrino fluence from a gbm triggered grb is @xcite @xmath88 smaller than the required neutrino flux ( equation [ grbnuflux ] ) .",
    "the ic has also given an upper limit to the neutrino fluence from a triggered grb ( averaged over 215 grbs ) , @xmath89 ( using @xmath90 ; see fig.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this is also smaller than required , although the comparison is not straightforward because these 215 grbs include not only those detected by gbm but also the other detectors .",
    "thus we reach the conclusion that grb neutrinos may not account for the ic detected neutrinos ( though the other grb neutrino models that can not be constrained by the neutrino-@xmath10-ray connection may still work @xcite ) .",
    "it may be noted that the reported gbm threshold and grb detection rate seem not completely consistent with the grb redshift and luminosity distributions derived by @xcite .",
    "however our result of using @xmath82 yr@xmath83 and @xmath84 is robust since @xmath91 is not sensitive to @xmath37 and taking @xmath92 yr@xmath83 ( for gbm threshold value ) even enhances the neutrino emission ( eq ) .",
    "our conclusion is similar to @xcite , but the main difference in between is the following .",
    "@xcite use several assumptions of the grb model , e.g. , the jet lorentz factor , the variability timescale , the fraction of energy in accelerated protons , etc .",
    ", in order to calculate the neutrino production .",
    "here we only need to assume that the neutrino flux is proportional to the @xmath10-ray one ( eq ) . this may be reasonable given that the mev @xmath10-rays essentially carry away all the energy of electrons which probably carry some constant fraction of the total jet energy , and that the neutrinos carry away some constant fraction of the energy of protons which also may carry some constant fraction of the total jet energy",
    ". these may be true in a statistical point of view , although it may not hold for individual grbs .",
    "agn jets have long been predicted to be high energy cr and neutrino sources , and the dominant contribution of neutrino emission may be quasar hosted blazars , in particular , the flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the high energy neutrino production is due to photopion interactions between jet produced crs and the external broadline and dust radiation .",
    "fsrqs are also bright in @xmath10-ray emission , which is possible to be produced by the primary electrons accelerated in the jets accompanying the production of high energy crs",
    ". we may use the -lat observations of fsrqs to make constraint on neutrino production .",
    "@xcite has reported the luminosity function and redshift evolution of the detected fsrqs , which imply that the diffuse @xmath10-ray flux from fsrqs is @xmath93 from @xmath94  mev to @xmath95  gev range ( figure 11 therein ) , i.e. , a whole sky integrated flux of @xmath96 compared with ic flux we have the ratio of neutrino to @xmath10-ray flux , @xmath97 , where the factor 3 comes from the equal flux in the three neutrino flavors .",
    "this ratio is consistent with the estimated photomeson production efficiency for cr protons above the threshold for interacting with the broadline emission , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the cover factor of the broadline emission region and @xmath100 is the accretion disk luminosity @xcite , if jet - produced high energy electrons and crs have comparable energies and a significant fraction of crs lies above the threshold of photopion production .",
    "therefore , fsrqs may produce diffuse neutrinos with a flux comparable to ic detection .",
    "however , agn jets may have difficulty in producing the detected , flat neutrino spectrum from tens tev to few pev @xcite . because the low energy radiation peaks at infrared to uv range , the photopion interactions tend to produce high neutrino flux at @xmath5pev , in contrast to the ic observation which appears as lack of neutrinos above few pev . because of the decreasing radiation above uv frequency , the predicted neutrino flux decreases fast below pev range , also in contrast to the ic observation .",
    "thus the @xmath101tev neutrinos may need the other origins instead of agns , and future observations at eev range are needed to test the high neutrino flux from agn jets .",
    "starburst galaxies ( sbgs ) have been expected to be promising neutrino sources @xcite , given that they are strong cr sources and that the high density ism and high magnetic field lead to high efficiency of cr energy loss by @xmath0 collisions .",
    "crs at @xmath101  pev may significantly lose their energy @xcite .",
    "it is noticed that the ic neutrino flux is well consistent with the waxman - bahcall bound @xcite , which may suggest that all the cr energy is lost in pion production .",
    "-lat has detected several sbgs in @xmath102  gev range@xcite . by comparing with their sfrs estimated by radio and far infrared detections",
    ", we have the @xmath10 ray luminosity and sfr relation in sbgs @xcite @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 is used ) . assuming this relation to be universal , the gev @xmath10-ray production rate density in the local universe is @xmath105ergyr@xmath83mpc@xmath106 . the gev @xmath10-ray intensity ( without attenuation )",
    "is @xmath107gev@xmath86s@xmath83sr@xmath83 .",
    "the neutrino and @xmath10-ray connection in @xmath0 collisions leads to the neutrino intensity in gev range of @xmath108gev@xmath86s@xmath83sr@xmath83 , which is one order of magnitude higher than the ic detected flux at pev scale .",
    "as suggested by cr confinement time ( @xmath109 ) and cr spectral slope ( @xmath110 ) measurement of crs in mw , the spectrum of injected crs may be @xmath111 .",
    "if the crs lost most of their energy in @xmath0 interactions then the neutrino spectral slope follows that of the crs , and the neutrino flux at pev scale extrapolated from gev range is @xmath112 consistent with ic detection .",
    "moreover , two sbgs , ngc253 and m82 , have been detected in tev range , which show tev flux lower than gev one by about one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "thus -lat observations suggest that neutrinos from @xmath0 interaction in sbgs may account for the ic detection .",
    "the calculation above does not consider that the local sfr density is dominated by normal star forming galaxies other than sbgs .",
    "however it is suggested in observations that most of the stars in the universe formed in sbgs at high redshift @xmath113 @xcite , thus the neutrino production is dominated by sbgs at @xmath114 .",
    "the above calculation is available since the local neutrino production does not contribute significantly to the total neutrino flux .",
    "using -lat observations and with the neutrino and @xmath10-ray connection , we have constrained the origin of ic neutrinos .",
    "the main conclusions are below :    first , the diffuse galactic neutrino emission from cr propagation in mw can not account for the ic detected neutrino flux if the cr spectral slope @xmath115 is universal in mw . in order to account for the ic neutrinos at pev scale , the dge spectral slope at @xmath116",
    "gev should be harder than @xmath117 .",
    "we obtain that the upper limit to the diffuse galactic neutrino flux at 60 tev is @xmath118 times lower than the ic excess by considering that the total -lat detected emission is from @xmath0 interactions .",
    "however , @xmath0 interactions only contribute a fraction of the dge . by the modeling of @xcite , the @xmath14-decay photons contribute to @xmath119 of the total lat flux in the ",
    "local \" and  outer galaxy \" , and @xmath120 of the total lat flux in the  inner galaxy \" .",
    "the expected diffuse galactic neutrino flux should be at least a factor of @xmath121 lower than the upper limit we obtain , so the diffuse galactic neutrino flux may contribute to @xmath122 of the ic detected neutrino flux .",
    "a study of the galactic latitude distribution of the detected neutrinos would be more powerful test than only considering the total neutrino flux , but needs much more statistics of neutrino events .",
    "future ic detection of the latitude distribution should be compared with the prediction of @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the detection of diffuse pev photons would be more direct test @xcite , other than extrapolation of @xmath10-ray spectrum from gev to pev scale .",
    "however , the current tev - pev photon detections only cover limited parts of the sky , e.g. , biased in the northern hemisphere , in contrast to -lat s deep survey of the whole sky .",
    "second , the high energy @xmath10-ray point sources in mw can not account for the ic excess , unless the @xmath10-ray spectra of these sources at @xmath116  gev is unexpectedly harder than a flat spectrum with photon index @xmath123 .",
    "the point source spectral indices beyond 100 gev are the main uncertainty .",
    "however , photons from some types of sources , such as pulsars , are not hadronic dominant at 100gev , which further reduces the expected flux from point sources .",
    "moreover , the galactic point sources concentrate on the galactic disk , very different from the sky location of ic neutrinos , which is consistent with isotropic distribution .",
    "it should also be mentioned that although the neutrino flux from galactic sources can hardly reach ic excess , both are in the same order of magnitude , suggesting that the galactic sources may contribute to a fraction of ic neutrinos .    again , the galactic latitude distribution of detected neutrinos is more powerful and straightforward test to the galactic point source origin .",
    "the ic - detected neutrinos arriving from high galactic latitudes seem to disfavor the galactic point source origin , but more detections of neutrinos in the future are required to study the latitude distribution with high confidence level .",
    "third , neutrino productions in grb jets may not account for the ic neutrino flux .",
    "this is based on the assumption that in grbs the neutrino flux is proportional to the @xmath10-ray flux .",
    "we have used the lat observations of grb gev emission to constrain neutrino flux .",
    "as time goes by , ic collects more observational results on grbs , the constraint on grb neutrino will be more and more stringent .    our method is applied to the classic grbs with the common picture that the neutrino production occurs in the region where the main burst of mev @xmath10-rays are produced , e.g. , the internal shock region @xcite .",
    "thus we do not constrain the neutrino production when the jet is still deep inside the grb progenitor @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that low - power jets inside progenitors of grbs may produce higher flux of tev - pev neutrinos",
    ". it would be important to measure the emissivity in the universe by more observations of these  low power grbs \" .    forth",
    ", -lat observation suggests that agn jets may produce neutrino flux as high as the ic flux .",
    "however , agn jets may have difficulty in explaining the flat spectrum from tens tev to few pev detected by ic .",
    "agn jets may not account for the tens - tev neutrinos detected by ic , and the future eev neutrino experiments would be important to test the predicted agn neutrino flux .    for the agn jet produced neutrinos to reach the ic detected flux , their local universe cr generation rate should be @xmath124 times larger than the local uhe cr emissivity , because of the low photopion production efficiency @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction with the consistency between ic detected neutrino flux and waxman - bahcall bound , unless that cr energy production rate decreases sharply by @xmath124 times from @xmath125 pev to @xmath126ev .",
    "finally , we use the -lat detections of individual sbgs to constrain the pev neutrino flux from sbgs , and find that they can account for the ic excess .",
    "@xcite have considered the neutrino emission from star forming galaxies , including sbgs , to explain the ic neutrinos .",
    "they use a more specific model , instead of the @xmath10-ray and neutrino connection as we emphasize here .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite have derived an maximum diffuse neutrino flux by assuming all crs lose energy in pion productions and normalizing the neutrino flux to the uhe cr production rate density .",
    "the 60tev-2pev neutrino flux detected by ic turns out to match the predicted waxman - bahcall bound , which implies that the crs in @xmath3  pev is the same component as the uhe crs @xcite and all the cr energy is lost in pion production .",
    "pev range to the observed uhe cr one , i.e. , they are different cr components of different origins in the universe .",
    "the consistency of the ic neutrino flux with the waxman - bahcall bound happens to be so . ]    as there is no bright agns in the local universe within the uhe cr energy loss length ( @xmath125 mpc ; due to interaction with cosmic microwave background photons ) , grbs are the more promising sources for uhe crs .",
    "thus , a likely explanation to the ic neutrinos is that the crs corresponding to the ic neutrinos are also produced by grbs .",
    "these crs do not lose significant fraction of their energy in grb jets , as constrained by -lat and ic observations of grbs , but they lose most energy after escaping from grb jets and propagate in grb host galaxies , which are mostly sbgs .",
    "future deeper observations of high energy @xmath10-rays and neutrinos from individual grbs and sbgs by , e.g. , cta and ic , etc , can test this interpretation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the icecube ( ic ) collaboration recently reported the detection of tev - pev extraterrestrial neutrinos whose origin is yet unknown . by the photon - neutrino connection in @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions </S>",
    "<S> , we use the -lat observations to constrain the origin of the ic detected neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we find that galactic origins , i.e. , the diffuse galactic neutrinos due to cosmic ray ( cr ) propagation in the milky way , and the neutrinos from the galactic point sources , may not produce the ic neutrino flux , thus these neutrinos should be of extragalactic origin . moreover , the extragalactic gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may not account for the ic neutrino flux , the jets of active galactic nuclei may not produce the ic neutrino spectrum , but the starburst galaxies ( sbgs ) may be promising sources . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested by the consistency between the ic detected neutrino flux and the waxman - bahcall bound , grbs in sbgs may be the sources of both the ultrahigh energy , @xmath2ev , crs and the @xmath3  pev crs that produce the ic detected tev - pev neutrinos . </S>"
