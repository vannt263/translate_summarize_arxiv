    "most of the success of physics in the 20th century has been achieved as a result of the applications of two philosophies.the first is the _ quantization philosophy _ and the second is the _",
    "geometerization philosophy_. the consequences of applying the first is the _ quantum theory _ , while the consequences of applying the second is the _ general theory of relativity _ , ( gr ) .",
    "the study and understanding of the four known fundamental interactions are not equally successful using , only , one of these two rival philosophies .",
    "electromagnetism , weak and strong interactions are well understood using the quantization philosophy , while gravity is not understood using this philosophy . in the context of geometerization of physics ,",
    "gr is considered as a good theory for gravity , while there are no such successful geometric theories for the other three interactions .",
    "it seems that a third philosophy is needed to unify the physics of the four fundamental interactions .",
    "this philosophy may lead to new physics .",
    "this would be , undoubtedly , a difficult task .",
    "it would be of importance to reach the conclusion that the two rival philosophies are completely exhausted , before trying a third one .",
    "this my be a less difficult task .",
    "it needs a careful examination of applying the existing philosophies .",
    "examination of the geometric approach to physics shows that this approach is * not * exhausted yet .",
    "some types of geometry admit some quantum properties .",
    "this is what i am going to show in the present work .",
    "the following statement summarizes the philosophy of gemeterization of physics :    _ `` to understand nature one should start with geometry and end with physics''_.    in applying this philosophy , one should look for an appropriate geometry .",
    "einstein , in applying his geometerization philosophy , used three types of geometry . some of the main properties of these geometries are summarized in the following table .",
    "table i : comparison between 3-types of geometry +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there are some evidences for the existence of the spin - gravity interaction on the laboratory scale ( the results of the cow - experiment ) , and on the galactic scale ( the data of sn1987a ) .",
    "now , to verify the existence of this interaction on the cosmological scale , observations of one parameter at least , using two different types of carriers , are needed .",
    "for example , if we observe neutrinos and photons to get hubble s parameter , a discrepancy of order 0.001 would be expected , if this interaction exists on the cosmological scale .",
    "in the present work , it is shown that , starting within the geometerization philosophy , some quantum properties appeared very naturally in the structure of two types of non - symmetric geometries ( see the third column of tables ii and iii ) .",
    "these properties emerged without imposing any known quantization schemes on the geometry .",
    "the properties characterize the torsion term of two new sets of path equations discovered in each geometry , ( 2.25 ) and ( 2.45 ) .",
    "the natural appearance of such properties can be considered as quantum roots built in non - symmetric geometry .",
    "it is shown that these roots could be extended and diffuse in the whole geometry , using a certain parameterization scheme , suggested in section 4 .",
    "this scheme , applied to the ap - geometry , could be applied with some efforts to the ens - geometry .",
    "the application of the parameterization scheme , not only diffuses the quantum properties in the whole geometric structure , but also solves the two main problems of the ap - geometry , mentioned in subsection 2.1 .",
    "we can summarize the main advantages of this scheme in the following points :      \\2 .",
    "it solves completely the curvature problems ( the identical vanishing of the curvature ( 2.12 ) ) , mentioned in subsection 2.1 , by defining a general parameterized non - vanishing curvature tensor ( 4.4 ) .",
    "\\3 . from the application point of view and",
    "depending on the curvature ( 4.4 ) , field theories written in the parameterized ap - geometry do not need the condition for a vanishing torsion ( which leads to a flat ap - space via ( 2.18 - 21 ) ) , in order to get a correct gr - limit .",
    "in other words , to switch - off the effect of the torsion , in such theories , we only take the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it solves the second problem of conventional ap - geometry , i.e. the non - physical applicability of the path equations ( 2.13 ) .",
    "the new quantum paths ( 4.3 ) could be used for physical applications , as shown in section 6 .",
    "\\5 . the parameterized absolute parallelism ( pap ) geometry is more general than both the riemannian and conventional ap - geometries .",
    "it could account for both geometries as two limiting cases .",
    "these limits can be obtained using ( 4.1b ) . the first limit @xmath1 , which corresponds to the conventional ap - geometry .",
    "the second is @xmath2 , which corresponds to the riemannian geometry .",
    "figure 1 [ 12 ] , is a schematic diagram giving the complete spectrum of geometries admitted by the pap - geometry .",
    "this figure is plotted using equations ( 4.4 ) and ( 4.6 ) .",
    "+ the new quantum paths ( 4.3)can be reduced to the geodesic equation of riemannian geometry ( or null - geodesic upon reparameterization ) , upon setting @xmath0 , which switch - off the effect of the torsion term . in this case",
    "the equation can account for classical mechanics and relativistic mechanics .",
    "but if @xmath3 , then the torsion of the background gravitational field will interact with some of the properties of the moving particle . recalling that the parameter @xmath4 jumps by steps of one - half , ( 4.10 ) , then one can conclude that the property of the test particle , by which it interacts with the torsion , is its quantum spin .",
    "for this reason , the torsion term in ( 4.3 ) is suggested to represent `` spin - gravity interaction '' .",
    "the linearization carried out in section 5 , shows clearly that this interaction will reduce newton s gravitational potential , as obvious from ( 5.10 ) .",
    "this equation shows that , the gravitational potential felt by a spinning particle is less than that felt by a spinless particle , or by a macroscopic object . in other words",
    ", one can say that , spinning particles feel the space - time torsion .",
    "this is similar to the fact that charged particles feel the electromagnetic potential , while neutral particles do not feel it .",
    "+ the discrepancy , between the experimental results and the theoretical calculations ( using newtonian gravity ) , of the cow - experiment gives a good indicator for the existence of spin - gravity interaction , on the laboratory scale .",
    "the experimental results are found to be lower than the expected theoretical calculations .",
    "this discrepancy can be interpreted , qualitatively , by a decrease in the gravitational potential , of the earth , felt by neutrons ( spin one - half particles ) .",
    "the value of this potential , felt by neutrons , is less than the value given by newton s theory .",
    "the application of the new quantum path ( 4.3 ) , subsection 6.1 , gives good , qualitative and quantitative , agreement with the experimental results .",
    "such agreement gives , not only an evidence of the existence of spin - gravity interaction , but also a direct confirmation of equation ( 4.3 ) .",
    "+ the application of the linearized form of ( 4.3 ) , in the case of motion of spinning massless particles coming from sn1987a , subsection 6.2 , gives a good model for the emission times of these particles from this supernova ( see table iv ) .",
    "this may indicate the presence of the spin - gravity interaction on the galactic scale .",
    "but more efforts are still needed , both to confirm supernovae mechanisms and for observing more supernovae , to give strong confirmation for the existence of this interaction on the astrophysical scale . + the full path equation ( 4.3 )",
    "is applied in the case of cosmology , subsection 6.3 .",
    "it is shown that the values of the cosmological parameters will be affected by the spin - gravity interaction , if it exists on the cosmological scale .",
    "the values of these parameters will depend on the spin of the particle , from which cosmological information are extracted .",
    "it is suggested that , a cosmological parameter measured using two massless particles , with different spins ( e.g. photon and neutrino ) may confirm the existence of spin - gravity interaction on the cosmological scale .",
    "the sensitivity of the apparatus , or experiment , to be used should be better than @xmath5 + in view of the present work , i will try to give short probable answers to some of the good questions raised by professor v.petrov in the closing session of the conference :          a2 : so for , in the context of geometerization of physics , we do nt need more that four dimensions .",
    "mass and charge appear as constants of integration .",
    "there are some attempts to represent other interactions ( e.g. electromagnetism ) together with gravity in spaces of four dimensions ( cf .",
    "[ 7 ] ) .",
    "a3 : concerning the experimental signature , the cow - type experiment is a good media for testing quantum - geometrical effects on the laboratory scale .",
    "the discrepancy in the results of this experiment gives a good indicator for the existence of such effects .    concerning the observational signature ,",
    "more efforts are needed for observing photons and neutrinos ( and probably gravitons , in the future ) , from supernovae events , in order to detect the existence of such effects on the astrophysical and cosmological scales .",
