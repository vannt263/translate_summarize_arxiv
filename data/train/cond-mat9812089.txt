    "granular materials exhibit phases that resemble yet are distinct from ordinary solids , liquids , and gases .",
    "( for reviews see refs  @xcite . ) granular materials at rest behave much like solids ( e.g. they can sustain stress ) , but when excited they can behave as a dense liquid or a more dilute gas , with varying degrees of correlated motion .",
    "many phenomena observed in granular materials involve more than one phase simultaneously .",
    "for example , in sheared granular materials and in avalanches both a solid phase and a liquid or gas phase are present .",
    "the coexistence of phases and the mechanisms of transitions between phases are of great interest .",
    "although there are no attractive interparticle forces , it is provocative to compare and contrast these phenomena to their condensed matter analogs .",
    "a critical difference is the presence of inelastic collisions and dissipation of energy in a granular medium  @xcite .",
    "energy has to be added continuously in order to maintain granular material in a fluid state .",
    "dissipation can also render the excited state unstable against density fluctuations .",
    "regions of elevated density experience an elevated collision rate , which decreases average particle speeds and leads to further local density increases through the granular equivalent of mass diffusion .",
    "the excited state collapses locally and clusters of particles at rest appear .",
    "this phenomenon has been studied numerically  @xcite for the cooling of a granular gas without energy input  @xcite .",
    "clustering has been predicted to persist in the presence of excitation  @xcite , whether the energy is provided homogeneously  @xcite or at the boundary  @xcite .",
    "clustering due to inelasticity has been studied experimentally by several groups  @xcite .",
    "granular materials can be excited conveniently with a controlled energy input through vertical vibrations of the container .",
    "since energy is transferred into horizontal motion through interparticle collisions , the ( mean ) vertical kinetic energy is always larger than the horizontal kinetic energy@xcite .",
    "olafsen and urbach @xcite , in a study of a vertically vibrated partial layer of steel spheres , found spontaneous clustering into a two - dimensional ordered crystal at rest surrounded by a sea of vibrating particles , as the peak acceleration was reduced below 1 g .",
    "both phases were found to coexist in steady state .    in this article",
    ", we study a triggered phase transition that transforms a quiescent disordered phase to an excited granular gas via a propagating front . starting with a partial two - dimensional layer of spherical beads at rest on a vibrating flat plate below a threshold vibration amplitude",
    ", we have observed that a small external perturbation of only one bead can induce a phase transition into a rapidly moving gaseous state that spreads to all beads .",
    "we determine the frequency - dependent range of vibration amplitudes where the phase transition can be triggered , and observe a subcritical - to - supercritical transition at a threshold frequency .",
    "we also measure the growth rate and interface shape of the gaseous region .",
    "we account for our observations using numerical studies of a single periodically forced bouncing particle subjected to random perturbations arising from collisions .",
    "the simulation explains the origin of the propagating front and may also help to explain the crystal - fluid coexistence discovered earlier  @xcite .",
    "other metastable states are known in granular matter .",
    "for example , a small perturbation suffices to trigger avalanches and a small ( tapping ) perturbation can start the flow of granular material from a hopper .",
    "the propagating front described here is different from these examples ; it arises from the coexistence of two dynamical attractors .",
    "the experiments are conducted in a rigid @xmath1  cm diameter circular container made of anodized aluminum that is oscillated vertically with a single frequency between @xmath2  hz and @xmath3  hz using a vts500 vibrator from vibration test systems inc .",
    "a computer controlled feedback loop keeps the vibration amplitude constant and reproducible .",
    "spherical ( grade 100 ) nonmagnetic 316 stainless steel beads with @xmath4  mm diameter are used as granular material .",
    "most experiments were carried out with a single layer of @xmath5 beads , which corresponds to a fractional coverage of @xmath6 ( half that of a hexagonal close packed layer ) .",
    "the particles are illuminated from four sides and images are captured with a @xmath7  pixel variable scan ccd camera ( ca - d2 , dalsa inc . ) at @xmath8  frames / s . in some experiments a @xmath9  pixel fast ccd camera ( sr-500 , kodak inc . )",
    "operated at @xmath10  frames / s was used .",
    "the coefficient of restitution for collisions with the aluminum plate ( i.e. the ratio of velocities after and before a collision ) , measured from images of successive vertical bounces taken with the fast camera , is @xmath11 at commonly observed particle speeds .",
    "this result is similar to @xmath12 , which was measured in ref .",
    "( a similar value , @xmath13 , was obtained in ref .",
    "we found that @xmath14 decreases with increasing impact velocity ( in agreement with refs  @xcite ) . when rotational motion or a tangential velocity component is present during collisions , the effective restitution coefficient decreases .",
    "conducting nonmagnetic 316 stainless steel was chosen for the beads .",
    "we found that the phase transitions occur at the same accelerations when the shaker s magnetic field was reduced by @xmath15 , and that the growth rate of the excited phase is unchanged .",
    "these facts indicate that the external magnetic field generated by the shaker does not influence the results presented here .",
    "we also did not find any significant electrostatic effects .      in order to create reproducible initial conditions for all experiments ,",
    "the container is vibrated for more than @xmath16  s at a peak acceleration @xmath17  g. then the vibration is abruptly turned off and the particles come to rest through free cooling ( i.e. decrease of particle energies through inelastic collisions ) .",
    "figure  [ corr_amorph ] shows the resulting radial autocorrelation function @xmath18 of images of the amorphous state after sudden cooling starting from different forcing frequencies ; the horizontal axis is scaled by the bead diameter .",
    "the correlation function is calculated from the greyscale intensity @xmath19 after subtraction of the average greyscale intensity as @xmath20 .",
    "we note a sharp peak near @xmath21 corresponding to the image of a single bead , and a tail that is insensitive to the vibration frequency and amplitude prior to the shut off .",
    "this tail is not present in the gaseous state , also shown .",
    "the clustering of beads during sudden cooling , which was anticipated numerically , appears to be insensitive to the frequency at which the beads were excited .",
    "when the amplitude is lowered slowly , clustering becomes measurably stronger , as is evident from the upper curve .",
    "the focus of the experiments presented in this article is the transition to a moving gaseous state , starting from the reproducible quiescent amorphous state produced by sudden cooling .",
    "if the peak acceleration is much larger than 1  g , all beads start moving immediately when the vibration is switched on . for peak accelerations much smaller than 1  g ,",
    "the beads remain quiescent on the plate indefinitely and return into the quiescent state when perturbed externally .",
    "in contrast , for a frequency dependent intermediate range of peak accelerations just below 1  g , the beads remain at rest when the vibration is switched on , but a transition to the moving gaseous state can be triggered by setting at least one bead into motion .",
    "figure  [ melt_img ] shows the typical evolution of a portion of the layer from the amorphous state to the gaseous state when a region of several beads is perturbed .",
    "the peak acceleration @xmath22 of the vibrated plate has been set below , but close to , a threshold @xmath23 that is dependent on driving frequency @xmath24 ; the beads remain essentially at rest on the plate ( fig  [ melt_img]a ) .",
    "an external perturbation is then applied to a few beads , either by rolling an additional bead through an inclined cylinder onto the surface or by pushing a few beads manually .",
    "the perturbed bead(s ) start to bounce and move in the horizontal direction , transmitting energy to their neighbors , which in turn start to move .",
    "an area within which all beads are moving develops quickly , surrounded by a denser area that marks the interface between the granular gas and the essentially static amorphous state ( fig .",
    "[ melt_img]b ) .",
    "the area of the moving gaseous phase increases rapidly as the dense front propagates into the amorphous phase ( fig .",
    "[ melt_img]c ) , until all beads are moving . for accelerations where a crystalline phase can exist ( see below ) , we observe the development of a crystal during the transition and its coexistence with the gaseous phase in the steady state .",
    "we use the absolute difference of two consecutive frames to calculate the area and the interface shape of the gaseous region .",
    "such a difference image , converted to black and white , produces a white spot at the initial and final positions of a moving bead , leaving all stationary beads and the background black .",
    "this allows us to distinguish between the essentially stationary amorphous phase and the moving gaseous phase .",
    "figures  [ melt_img]d - f are difference images corresponding to fig .",
    "[ melt_img]a - c .",
    "( the difference images reveal that a few beads do move even in the amorphous phase , so small spontaneous perturbations are always present . ) in order to extract the size and shape of the gaseous region from the difference images , we create a continuous white region using nih image .",
    "the perimeter of the gaseous region , extracted with this method from the absolute difference of two consecutive frames , is shown overlayed onto the second frame in fig .",
    "[ overlay ] .",
    "the dense front clearly moves as the gaseous phase expands , so we consider the dense front as part of the gaseous phase  @xcite .",
    "the transition between the amorphous and gaseous phases , triggered by external perturbations , can occur only for a small range of vibrator accelerations .",
    "below a low acceleration limit @xmath25 , no perturbation is able to initiate a gaseous region that persists for at least one minute . above a higher acceleration @xmath23 , the spontaneous perturbations present in the amorphous state ( observable in fig .",
    "[ melt_img]d ) , are sufficiently strong to trigger a propagating front within two minutes without an external perturbation .",
    "figure  [ meltpnt ] shows @xmath25 and @xmath23 as a function of the driving frequency @xmath24 .",
    "the hysteretic region between @xmath23 and @xmath25 was found to be reproducible to within @xmath26 of the driving acceleration .",
    "it decreases with increasing frequency , and a subcritical to supercritical transition takes place at @xmath27  hz . at higher frequencies , spontaneous excitation of the gaseous phase",
    "is observed for @xmath28 , but any excitation decays slowly , and even large external perturbations fail to trigger a transition into the gaseous state . for @xmath29 , on the other hand , areas of local excitation develop ( often in numerous spots simultaneously ) and propagate quickly throughout the system . the freezing and evaporation points of the crystalline phase",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "[ meltpnt ] as open symbols . at lower frequencies they fall in the middle of the hysteretic region , while at higher frequencies ( roughly above @xmath30 ) they lie above the amorphous - to - gaseous transition .",
    "when the freezing point falls within the hysteretic region , the amorphous - to - gaseous transition leads to a gaseous phase for accelerations above the freezing point , and to coexisting crystalline and gaseous regions at accelerations below the freezing point .",
    "additional measurements indicate that at a lower bead coverage @xmath31 , both @xmath25 and @xmath23 change by less than @xmath32 .      the growth rate of the gaseous region can be measured between @xmath25 and @xmath23 ( and even somewhat above @xmath23 by applying an external perturbation quickly , before a spontaneous instability occurs ) .",
    "figure  [ meltrate ] shows a double logarithmic plot of the area @xmath33 of the gaseous region as a function of time after initiation by a perturbation .",
    "the measurements are carried out at @xmath2  hz and @xmath34  hz for several peak accelerations within the hysteresis region and slightly above @xmath23 .",
    "a doubling of the driving frequency slows the rate of growth of the gaseous area by approximately a factor of 4 .",
    "reducing the coverage does not change the initial growth rate , but leads to faster growth at later times . the total plate area @xmath35 limits the growth eventually .",
    "figure  [ meltrate ] indicates that the growth , after an initial transient during which the dense front forms , can be approximately described by a power law with an exponent that is independent of acceleration and only slightly dependent on coverage .",
    "however , the exponent changes significantly with frequency .",
    "a realistic description of the dynamics of growth of the gaseous region is complicated by the dynamics of the dense layer of beads ahead of the interface , which appears to slow the growth of the gaseous region .",
    "the dense layer is pushed uniformly by the advancing gas under some conditions ( see fig .  [ overlay ] ) , but in other cases crystalline regions form that do not move .",
    "the advancing front then grows around those regions , leaving behind slowly melting crystalline regions within the gaseous phase . at small coverages ( @xmath36 ) an interface between the amorphous and gaseous phase",
    "is not defined , as moving beads can pass many stationary beads between collisions . in this case",
    "the rate of increase in the number of moving beads is only limited by the mean interval between collisions with stationary beads .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to describe the growth process approximately by noting that the growth rate @xmath37 increases in proportion to the perimeter @xmath38 between the gaseous and the amorphous regions as shown in fig .",
    "[ dadtvsp ] for areas between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we find @xmath41 where the front velocity @xmath42 depends on @xmath22 and @xmath24 .",
    "this indicates that the growth rate of the gaseous area is roughly proportional to the rate at which beads collide with the interface once a dense layer has formed .",
    "the front velocity @xmath42 is shown in fig .",
    "[ growth_rate ] .",
    "it increases approximately linearly with @xmath22 and goes through zero near @xmath43 .",
    "the hysteretic nature of both the amorphous - to - gaseous transition ( and to a lesser degree the crystalline - to - gaseous transition @xcite ) below @xmath44 peak acceleration indicates that an energy gap exists between the states at rest ( amorphous and crystalline ) and the lowest energy excited steady state .",
    "the simplest model that can be used to explain the observed behavior is based on the dynamics of a single bead bouncing on a plate under sinusoidal vibrations @xmath45 .",
    "the peak acceleration then is @xmath46 . in a collision with the plate , the vertical bead velocity changes from @xmath47 to @xmath48 : @xmath49 the bead at rest on the plate ( @xmath50 ) always represents a stable steady state solution below @xmath51  g peak acceleration with an average bead energy @xmath52 per unit mass .",
    "additional steady states appear as the acceleration is increased .",
    "the first nonsticking steady state is a periodic bouncing with speed at the instant of collision given by : @xmath53 for periodic bouncing every vibration period this requires : @xmath54 and therefore ( at the moment of contact ) @xmath55 per unit mass .",
    "other excited states that are observable under conditions similar to the experiment have higher energy .",
    "states with a period @xmath56 , where the bead hits the plate on average once per vibration period and the impact pattern is repeated after @xmath57 cycles , have an average energy of @xmath58 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath59 occurs for the simple periodic state @xmath60 , where the time intervals between contacts with the plate @xmath61 are of equal length .",
    "periodic or chaotic states with more than one plate impact per vibration period would have lower energy if they exist , but no such state was found in several calculations of basins of attraction using the bouncing ball program by tufillaro _ et al _",
    "@xcite with parameters similar to the experiment .",
    "those states therefore either do not exist , are unstable , or have a negligible basin of attraction .    for vibrator accelerations below @xmath62",
    "an energy gap therefore exists between the lowest energy steady state @xmath63 , which is the quiescent state , and the first excited state , a periodic bouncing state with energy @xmath64 .",
    "we propose that this energy gap determines the size of the hysteretic region .",
    "the measured decrease in the extent of hysteresis with increasing @xmath24 may reflect the dependence of @xmath64 and @xmath63 on @xmath65 .",
    "the discussion so far , which is based on a one dimensional idealized model , has neglected perturbations . in the experiments , however , perturbations are important , as each bead is subjected to frequent interparticle collisions ( which create and sustain horizontal motion ) and to other perturbations ( e.g. due to slight nonuniformities of the vibrator surface ) . since a perturbation can trigger a transition into a different steady state , we include them in a model that can be simulated numerically .",
    "we follow the vertical movement of a single bead that is subjected to random perturbations of its vertical speed representing collisions with other beads . our strategy is to determine the mean energy of the vertical motion and to compare it with that of the first excited state .",
    "therefore , we do not track the horizontal speed of the particle .",
    "the time of perturbation events is selected randomly to create an average perturbation rate @xmath66 .",
    "the velocity of the bead after a perturbation is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a random number with gaussian distribution and unit variance . to verify that the results do not depend on the choice of the probability distribution",
    ", we also tried letting @xmath68 be either @xmath69 ( randomly ) , with similar results .",
    "energy losses from interparticle collisions are included through @xmath70 .",
    "bead and plate positions are calculated at fixed time intervals @xmath71 .",
    "the time of bead impact on the plate is calculated to within @xmath72 .",
    "the bead is considered to be stuck if more than one bounce per time interval occurs .",
    "the coefficients used in the simulations were @xmath73  hz , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 ( a rough estimate for the effective coefficient of restitution in the presence of bead rotations during impact ) .",
    "after an initial transient time of @xmath76  s the average behavior of the bead is recorded for @xmath77  s.    since the calculations are carried out for one bead only , it is not determined a priori whether the perturbation rate is sustainable from interbead collisions in a many particle system .",
    "many particles must be in an excited steady state to sustain continued collisions , since two quiescent particles can not collide .",
    "collisions are only able to maintain or increase the number of excited particles ( a necessary condition for sustainability of the collision rate ) if the steady state mean energy is comparable to @xmath64 .",
    "significantly lower computed mean energies would actually not be sustainable in the many particle system , because collisions would lead to a loss of particles from the excited state , and the system would settle into the ground state attractor for all particles .",
    "to check the conditions under which @xmath78 , we show in fig .",
    "[ energy_sim ] the average energy of the particle as a function of @xmath66 . as the perturbation rate is increased ,",
    "the energy of the particle first increases and then decreases . for comparison ,",
    "the energies of a single bead in the lowest excited state @xmath64 and in the quiescent state @xmath63 of the unperturbed problem are shown as horizontal lines . at @xmath79  g ,",
    "@xmath80 for all perturbation rates ; therefore the particle will be trapped in the stationary ground state . for @xmath81 , @xmath82 the mean particle energy is larger than @xmath64 ( except for @xmath83 ) ; here the quiescent state attractor does not exist . on the other hand , for @xmath84  g  @xmath85  g , @xmath82 for a limited range of @xmath66 ; this regime will show hysteresis .",
    "this explains qualitatively the occurrence of hysteresis for a many particle system that is sufficiently dense to provide the required collision rate .",
    "the propagating front is basically a self - sustained chain reaction .",
    "in this paper we have described the steady states and phase transitions of a two dimensional layer of beads subjected to vertical vibrations below @xmath44 peak acceleration .",
    "we start from a nearly static amorphous state created by temporarily stopping the vibration while all particles are moving rapidly .",
    "free cooling of the granular layer creates a reproducible structure , with a correlation function that is not dependent on the driving frequency or acceleration over a wide range .",
    "starting from this quiescent disordered ( `` amorphous '' ) state , we observe a striking transition to the gaseoue state , via a propagating front , as the vibration amplitude is increased .",
    "a region of hysteresis exists for which the amorphous phase remains metastable but a perturbation induces a transition .",
    "the final state can consist either of gas , or of crystal and gas , depending on the acceleration and coverage .",
    "the velocity of the propagating front @xmath42 , which remains constant during the transition , increases linearly with peak plate acceleration @xmath22 and decreases with increasing vibration frequency @xmath24 .",
    "a simple model , based on a single bouncing bead with random perturbations modeling collisions , exhibits behavior that is consistent with the experimental results .",
    "an energy gap between the ground and excited states of the single bouncing bead leads to a chain reaction that can sustain the excited state of the many - particle system under the right conditions .",
    "the phenomenon is similar in some respects to a flame front .",
    "the coexistence of the ground state and excited state attractor can be seen most clearly at low coverage , where collisions become sufficiently rare that beads can remain in the ground state attractor long enough to become stationary . in fig .",
    "[ speed_bounce ] we show a time average image at @xmath86 .",
    "moving beads appear in this figure as streaks and stationary ones as bright spots .",
    "in addition , small clusters of beads at rest are clearly observable .",
    "the crystal - gas coexistence is another potential manifestation of the coexistence of the two attractors , in this case spatially separated by an interface .",
    "the simulation therefore suggests a possible origin of the crystalline phase discovered by olafsen and urbach  @xcite . as the acceleration is lowered , the maximum energy provided by the plate decreases until more energy is lost in collisions than can be supplied by the plate .",
    "beads then come to rest in the dense regions of the plate where the collision losses are greatest .",
    "a crystal forms as the moving beads apply pressure to the cluster at rest , forcing it into the densest possible configuration . bouncing beads that hit the crystal tend to come to rest at the interface , increasing the size of the crystal but simultaneously decreasing the bead concentration in the remaining gaseous phase .",
    "crystal growth stops when the density of the gaseous phase is lowered sufficiently that the ( density - dependent ) collision rate can be sustained in steady state .",
    "we conclude that the rich variety of steady states that are observed just below @xmath51  g peak vibrator acceleration are related to the coexistence of a ground state attractor that exists up to @xmath51  g and excited state attractors that exist below @xmath51  g. the rapidly propagating front of highly excited beads spreading in a sea of beads at rest , which can be triggered by one moving bead without a change in the acceleration amplitude , is a striking many body consequence of this coexistence .",

    "we appreciate helpful discussions with i. aronson , j .- c .",
    "geminard and j. urbach .",
