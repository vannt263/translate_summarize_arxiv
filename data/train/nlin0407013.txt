    "the dynamics of small impurities , such as droplets , dust or bubbles , transported by an incompressible flow is much more complex than that of point - like fluid tracers .",
    "this is due to their finite size and to their mass density being different from that of the carrier fluid . as a consequence of their inertia",
    "the dynamics of such particles is dissipative , leading to inhomogeneities in their spatial distribution .",
    "this phenomenon , frequently referred to as _ preferential concentration _ , has been observed for a long time in experiments ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "suspended particles typically interact through collisions and chemical or biological processes .",
    "it is therefore very important in a large spectrum of applications to quantify the effects of inertia on these interactions .",
    "le us mention for instance the problem of estimating the time scales of rain initiation in warm clouds.@xcite other examples are the problem of microorganism predator - prey encounters in turbulent flows,@xcite and the enhancement of chemical reaction rates for active particles suspended in fluid flows.@xcite being a common characteristics of many of the above examples , here we focus on very dilute suspensions of very small particles that are much heavier than the carrier fluid .",
    "they are moved by the fluid through a viscous drag , whose nondimensional characteristic time , the stokes number @xmath0 , is proportional to the square of their radius . in most cases ,",
    "particle sizes are below the smallest characteristic scale of the flow , where the fluid velocity is spatially smooth .",
    "we are interested in the interactions taking place at those scales and we therefore consider random smooth flows .    in the last few years , much effort has been devoted both from a theoretical@xcite and numerical@xcite point of view to understand and quantify the enhancement of collision rates induced by inertia .",
    "two mechanisms have been identified : preferential concentration increases the probability for two particles to be at a colliding distance,@xcite detachment from fluid trajectories may enhance the relative velocity between two approaching particles.@xcite previous works mostly treated independently these two mechanisms .",
    "this is justified in the asymptotics of very small and very large inertia . in the former ,",
    "particles are almost tracers so that their relative velocity is given by the fluid velocity shear ; the discrepancy from a uniform distribution is responsible for an enhancement of collisions . in the other limit particle motion is essentially ballistic : they distribute uniformly but they may reach the same position with very different velocities  this is known as the _ sling effect_.@xcite",
    "several attempts have been done to bridge the gap between these two asymptotics .",
    "for instance , kruis and kusters@xcite proposed an interpolating formula for the typical particle relative velocity , by summing together the effect of shear due the fluid velocity and the acceleration induced by inertia .",
    "this model , though reducing to the result of saffman and turner@xcite in the tracer limit and of abrahamson@xcite for very large inertia , does not take into account the effects of preferential concentration .",
    "some improvements have been proposed in ref . by using two analytical models for the fluid - particle velocities , but still neglecting the effect of particle clustering .",
    "we propose here a new approach which treats these two mechanisms in a coherent manner .",
    "of course , we do not to provide a complete analytical model for the collision rates , our aim is to introduce a consistent phenomenological framework where the quantities relevant to its estimation are stressed out",
    ". we mainly make use of tools borrowed from dynamical systems@xcite to reinterpret inertial effects .",
    "the basic idea is to take into account the full position - velocity phase - space dynamics of particles .",
    "preferential concentration of particles is then understood as the convergence of trajectories toward a dynamically evolving attractor in phase space .",
    "folding of the attractor in the velocity direction is responsible for the increase of the velocity differences between particles .",
    "the statistical properties of the fractal set are determined by the carrier flow and depend on the particle radius through the stokes number .",
    "this approach has a natural extension to polydisperse suspensions where particles are distributed over sizes : the effects of inertia on the relative motion of particles can there be studied in terms of correlations between attractors labeled by different stokes numbers .",
    "as we focus on very dilute suspensions , the dynamical effects of collisions are here neglected , i.e.  we work within a ghost particle approximation.@xcite this allows us to investigate the phase space in terms of the lagrangian dynamics , that is following the trajectories of particle pairs .",
    "thus clustering can be characterized in terms of the probability , @xmath1 , for the pair separation to be below a distance @xmath2 ; in the same fashion we introduce the `` rate of approach '' , defined as the fraction of particle pairs at a distance @xmath2 that approach each other during a unit time .",
    "this is given by the average of the negative part of the radial velocity difference at a separation @xmath2 .",
    "as we shall see , the @xmath2-dependence of these two quantities sheds light on and characterizes the various regimes of particle motion .",
    "moreover , the approaching rate allows to estimate , once @xmath2 is fixed to be the sum of the particle radii , the collision rates .    in the monodisperse case @xmath1 behaves as a power law with an exponent displaying a non - trivial dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "this exponent is equal to the space dimension , @xmath3 , in both the very small and very large stokes number asymptotics , where particles distribute uniformly . the scaling behavior of the rate of approach results from the joint effect of clustering and velocity difference between particles .",
    "the latter behave very differently in the two asymptotics : for @xmath4 it is proportional to @xmath2 , while for @xmath5 it becomes independent of the separation . for intermediate values of the stokes number , correlations between particle separations and velocity differences leads to non - trivial scaling behavior for the approaching rate .    as to polydisperse suspensions",
    "we show that for the relative motion of two particles with different stokes numbers , a critical separation @xmath6 is singled out . below it ,",
    "the two motions are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "correlations , due to the fact that particles are suspended in the same flow , show up for length scales above @xmath7 .",
    "the origin of this characteristic length is understood in terms of the pair - separation dynamics , which is dominated by the stokes difference for @xmath8 ( the accelerative mechanism ) , and by the fluid velocity ( the shear mechanism ) when @xmath9 .",
    "this crossover length separates in two distinct regimes the scale dependence of both the probability distribution of particle separations and their rate of approach .    exploiting the phenomenological understanding , supplemented by numerical computation , of the @xmath2-dependence of the approaching rate ( for equal - size and different - size particle pairs ) we finally propose a semiquantitative , phenomenological model for the effective collision kernel in polydisperse suspensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : dynamics ] , after recalling the equations of motion , we discuss the basic ingredients and the validity of the approach based on lagrangian statistics and ghost collisions . in section  [ sec : numeric ] model flows used for numerical illustrations are described . in section  [ sec : samestokes ] and  [ sec : diffstokes ] we investigate the scaling behavior of the pair separation probability and of the approaching rate in monodisperse and polydisperse suspensions , respectively . in section  [ sec : kernel ] , after a brief review of earlier investigations and models , we propose a phenomenological model for the effective collision kernel in polydisperse suspensions .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "the dynamics of very dilute impurities suspended in an incompressible flow @xmath10 is described by a standard model proposed by maxey and riley,@xcite which was derived under the following assumptions .",
    "the particle radius , @xmath11 , must be much smaller than the kolmogorov length @xmath12 .",
    "particle reynolds number has to be small enough to ensure that the impurity is surrounded by a stokes flow .",
    "the suspension should be very dilute so that both the hydrodynamical interactions between particles , and their feedback on the carrier fluid can be neglected .",
    "since we focus on the effects induced solely by inertia , we ignore gravity . here",
    "we address the problem of particles much heavier than the carrier fluid , so that this model reduces to the newton equation:@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the trajectory .",
    "the response time @xmath15 , frequently referred to as the stokes time , is related to the particle radius @xmath11 by @xmath16 where the mass density ratio between the particle and the fluid @xmath17 is assumed to be very large ( e.g. for water droplet in air @xmath18 and for aerosols @xmath19 ) ; @xmath20 is the fluid kinematic viscosity .",
    "it is worth reminding that , in the asymptotics of very heavy particles , the prerequisite of small particle reynolds number does not restrict too much the admissible range for the values of the stokes time . indeed the nondimensional stokes number @xmath21 ( defined as the ratio between the particle response time and the shortest characteristic time scale of the turbulent fluid flow , i.e.  the eddy turnover time @xmath22 associated to the kolmogorov scale ) may vary in a range from @xmath23 , the tracer limit , to about @xmath24 for particle sizes of the order of @xmath25 with large mass density ratio .    in terms of the nondimensional parameter @xmath0 , the equation of motion ( [ eq : motion ] ) can then be rewritten as @xmath26 time being now rescaled by @xmath22 . here",
    ", we explicitly introduce the particle velocity @xmath27 to emphasize that , at variance with tracers , particle dynamics takes place in the @xmath28-dimensional position - velocity phase space @xmath29 .",
    "it should be noted that the dynamics defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion2 ] ) is uniformly contracting at a rate @xmath30 , so that particle trajectories generally concentrate in phase space onto a dynamically evolving attractor . in the large time",
    "asymptotics the phase - space density of particles , solution of the liouville equation associated to ( [ eq : motion2 ] ) , becomes singular with its support on this attractor .",
    "its statistical properties are usually multifractal.@xcite    we consider a collection of particles with different stokes numbers embedded in a flow defined in a finite domain of size @xmath31 .",
    "even though the particles are carried by the same fluid flow , they converge to different attractors according to their stokes number . a suitable characterization of suspension dynamics is given by the instantaneous phase - space densities @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 is normalized by the total number of particles with stokes number @xmath0 , so that it can be interpreted as the probability density to find at time @xmath34 a particle with stokes number @xmath0 at position @xmath35 and with velocity @xmath36 and for a given fluid flow realization",
    ".    in experiments,@xcite one often has access to the distribution of particles in the position space only .",
    "the latter is obtained by integrating over particle velocities , @xmath37 . for tracers ,",
    "the density @xmath38 is uniformly distributed over the domain , so that the coarse - grained density @xmath39 , obtained by integrating over small volumes of size @xmath2 , scales as @xmath40 , being @xmath3 the spatial dimension . on the contrary , for inertial particles , typically @xmath41 with @xmath42 markedly smaller than the space dimension @xmath3 . the _ information dimension _",
    "@xmath42 is one among the dimensions @xmath43 that characterize the scaling properties of multifractal densities.@xcite for particle pairs dynamics the relevant quantity is the _ correlation dimension _",
    "@xmath44 , which measures the scale dependency of the probability @xmath45 that two particles on the same attractor are separated by a distance smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "deviations of @xmath46 from the value @xmath3 corresponding to a uniform distribution are important to quantify the weight of clustering ( induced by inertia ) on particle - to - particle interactions .",
    "the _ radial distribution function _",
    "@xmath47 is frequently used in the literature to characterize clustering of inertial particles.@xcite this quantity can be expressed as the ratio between the actual number of particles inside an infinitesimally thin shell of radius @xmath2 centered on a given particle and the number that would be expected if the particles were uniformly distributed .",
    "it is easily checked that the radial distribution function behaves as @xmath48 . for particles",
    "uniformly distributed , @xmath49 , so that @xmath50 . on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath51 , the signature of particle clustering , @xmath47 diverges as @xmath52 , as it was numerically demonstrated in refs .  .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that clustering is also found in tracers advected by compressible flows .",
    "when the compressibility is sufficiently large , particles can collapse onto point - like attractors : this is usually referred to as the _ strong compressibility _",
    "rgime.@xcite in such flows , particle inertia may induce a further enhancement of clustering , leading to a strong compressibility rgime even at lower values of the compressibility.@xcite    suspensions generally involve local interactions among the particles : dry dust scatters through elastic or inelastic collisions depending on their impact velocities@xcite or water droplets coalesce to form rain drops.@xcite in dilute suspensions the dominant interactions are the binary collisions taking place when two particles with radii @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( _ viz . _",
    "stokes numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) , are at a distance @xmath57 .",
    "it has been proposed@xcite that for very dilute suspensions , as considered here , the collision rates can be estimated by using the so - called _ ghost collisions _ approach .",
    "the main idea of this method is to let the particles overlap after they come across a distance equal to the sum of their radii .",
    "neither the particle sizes , nor their velocities are modified after such an event : the collisions are not physically performed but just recorded and counted to estimate the rate at which they happen .",
    "to understand the relevance of such an approach let us perform the following _ gedanken _ experiment : we throw independently a very large number of particle pairs inside a given domain and let them evolve in different random realizations of the carrier flow until the two particles forming these pairs collide .",
    "we define here the collision rate as the rate at which the number of particle pairs which have not collided decreases with time .",
    "the dynamics starts with transients during which the probability that two particles collide is strongly influenced , for instance , by the choice of the initial velocities and positions of the particles . when the dynamics of the particles has converged to a statistical steady state , the collision rate attains an asymptotic value which depends on the stokes numbers of the particles and on the properties of the carrier flow .",
    "this limiting value is that measured when assuming ghost collisions .",
    "the latter are hence expected to give a good estimate of collision rates in those situations where the time of convergence to a steady rgime is much shorter than the mean free time between collisions of particles , as it is for instance the case when considering very diluted suspensions .",
    "the framework of ghost collisions have already been compared to several other collision schemes.@xcite as one could easily expect , it was found to be of particular relevance when the volume fraction of particles is very low .",
    "note finally that beside justifying the use of this approach , the high - dilution hypothesis has another important aspect : it permits to neglect the feedback effect of particles on the fluid flow ( the so - called reverse coupling ) and to focus on understanding the enhancement of collision rates solely linked to particle inertia .    in order to evaluate collision rates",
    ", we introduce the rate at which particles at a distance @xmath2 approach each other , which can be written in terms of the phase - space densities as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and the phase - space integral is performed both on velocities and on positions satisfying @xmath60 , and @xmath61 denotes the negative part of the radial velocity difference @xmath62 .",
    "the average @xmath63 \\rangle$ ] is performed over the realizations of the fluid velocity field .",
    "it easily understood that , for @xmath64 , the rate of approach @xmath65 gives the fraction of particles of size @xmath53 and @xmath54 colliding per unit time inside the domain .",
    "however , as we shall see , the full @xmath2-dependence of @xmath65 is very informative on the dynamics and thus interesting by itself .",
    "the role of inertia in increasing the rate ( [ eq : rate ] ) with respect to simple tracers can be understood easily for equal - stokes particles , @xmath66 .",
    "first , the clustering due to inertia enhances the probability for particles to be close to each other . as emphasized in ref .",
    ", this mechanism is very important in the asymptotics @xmath4 .",
    "second , an additional increase of the rate of approach @xmath65 may be induced by large radial velocity differences . as a consequence ,",
    "non - trivial dependencies of @xmath65 on the scale separation @xmath2 will emerge .",
    "this effect is known to be very important at large @xmath0 , where caustics appear in the phase - space distribution of particles .",
    "such singularities correspond to physical - space positions where a folding of the attractor leads to the presence of different branches in velocity at the same position , and hence , to large velocity differences between close particles .",
    "such a folding in velocity is the basic mechanism leading to what is known as the sling effect.@xcite      clearly , a direct @xmath67-dimensional numerical integration to determine phase - space densities is a difficult task .",
    "we thus adopt a different strategy by using a lagrangian approach . indeed , investigating two - point correlations of densities , as needed for binary collisions ,",
    "is equivalent to study the relative motion of particle pairs .",
    "moreover the average over velocity configurations can now be replaced by a time average.@xcite . to evaluate the rate of approach @xmath65 ,",
    "it is sufficient to follow two particles with stokes numbers @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and to compute the time average of the negative component of the radial velocity difference conditioned on the pair distance , @xmath2 .",
    "numerically , it is more convenient to condition such averages on having the two particles at a distance smaller than @xmath2 , rather than exactly equal to @xmath2",
    ". this amounts to work with cumulative quantities that are by far less noisy .",
    "we hence define @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the heaviside function and the overbar denotes lagrangian time averaging ; the rate ( [ eq : rate ] ) is then obtained as @xmath72 .    to quantify the balance between the two effects enhancing collisions mentioned above , namely clustering and large velocity differences , we make use of the probability density function @xmath73 for the pair separation .",
    "it is clear that this quantity is related to the radial distribution function by @xmath74 .",
    "similarly , instead of measuring directly @xmath73 , we consider the cumulative probability @xmath75 that is the probability that two particles are at a distance closer than @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath76 ( note that while @xmath77 is adimensional , @xmath78 has the dimension of the inverse of a length . )    for separations @xmath2 much smaller than the smallest characteristic length scale of the fluid flow ( e.g.  the kolmogorov scale @xmath12 for turbulent flows ) , both @xmath78 and @xmath65 are expected to display power law behaviors : @xmath79 therefore , the corresponding cumulative quantities @xmath77 and @xmath80 do also behave algebraically with exponents @xmath81 and @xmath82 . note that these quantities are symmetric under particle exchange @xmath83 , so that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    for equal - stokes particles ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 is exactly the correlation dimension @xmath46 of the projection of the attractor onto the physical space . for generic pairs , the exponent @xmath88 measures the correlation between the distributions of particles of the two types . for smooth flows",
    ", the exponent @xmath89 is constrained between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the lower bound is attained when particle velocities and their separation @xmath2 are uncorrelated , while the upper bound correspond to a velocity difference between particles proportional @xmath2 .",
    "since collisions occur at distances comparable with the particle radii , therefore typically much smaller than the turbulent viscous scale @xmath12 , we can limit ourselves to smooth incompressible fluid velocity fields . in order to perform long time averages at a reasonable cost",
    ", we consider synthetic random flows .",
    "the physical mechanisms are not expected to be very sensitive to the space dimensionality .",
    "the only important effect is that the probability of finding two close particles decreases with the dimension @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore choose two - dimensional flows in a finite domain of size @xmath31 .",
    "the validity of the results presented in this work should extend , at least qualitatively , to more realistic velocity fields .",
    "first , we consider an isotropic , homogeneous and gaussian flow .",
    "the fourier modes of the fluid velocity are ornstein  uhlenbeck processes satisfying @xmath92 where the @xmath93 s are independent white noises and the correlation time @xmath94 is independent of the wavevector @xmath95 . the process ( [ eq : ou ] ) is defined over @xmath96 modes and the constants @xmath97 s have been suitably chosen to ensure statistical isotropy at small scales .",
    "this velocity field , being smooth in space and continuous in time , is expected to mimic the dissipative - range dynamics , when neglecting intermittency effects ; @xmath31 should then be understood as the kolmogorov scale @xmath12 , and the correlation time @xmath94 as the kolmogorov time @xmath98 .",
    "note that the existence of random dynamical attractors for heavy particles , and hence of a statistically steady state , has been recently proved for this model flow.@xcite the advantage of using a reduced number of modes is that the fourier summation can be directly performed at particle positions , enabling to resolve the finest scales of the dynamics without interpolation .",
    "particles evolve according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion ] ) in a periodic domain of size @xmath99 ( here @xmath100 ) .",
    "time marching is performed by a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme for times up to @xmath101 .",

    "the stokes number is defined as @xmath107 .",
    "the reason for studying such a model flow is twofold .",
    "first , it is interesting for testing the robustness of the results , at least at a qualitative level .",
    "second , this model flow has the nice feature that the integration of particle motion can be done explicitly in each time interval of duration @xmath108 , allowing for extremely long time averages ( up to @xmath109 ) .",
    "we start considering the asymptotics of small stokes numbers , that is when the particle response time is much smaller than any typical time scale of the flow .",
    "a simple perturbative expansion of ( [ eq : motion2 ] ) implies that inertial particles behave as fluid tracers evolving in a slightly compressible flow whose divergence is proportional to @xmath0.@xcite at small separations @xmath110 , being the carrier flow spatially smooth at these scales , the radial velocity difference of two particles is proportional to @xmath2 . hence , for equal - size particles @xmath111 . for a vanishing",

    "it follows @xmath182",

    "this assumption implies a one - to - one correspondence between the stokes number and the particle size , namely @xmath183 . in this framework",
    "the simplest phenomenological description of particle collisions in dilute suspensions focuses on the total number of collisions per unit time between particles of sizes @xmath53 and @xmath54 averaged over the fluid velocity realizations : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the mean number of particles with size @xmath186 inside the domain .",

    "building quantitative models of the collision kernel in turbulent flows is of utmost importance for many natural phenomena and industrial processes .",
    "for instance , we stress that the knowledge of @xmath191 is crucial to understand the evolution of the droplet size distribution in clouds,@xcite which is of paramount importance for a theoretical comprehension of the rain drops formation.@xcite we believe that the main ingredients needed for such a program are , at least at qualitative level , independent on the complexity of the flow .",
    "therefore , here we shall concentrate on the simpler case of random flows , ignoring some ( though important ) aspects of turbulent flows .",
    "our aim is to develop a semi - quantitative phenomenological model for @xmath187 able to capture the main ingredients of collisions in suspensions with a broad distribution of particle sizes .",
    "there are two asymptotic regimes where the properties of @xmath191 are well understood , namely for vanishing inertia ( @xmath192 ) and for infinite response time ( @xmath193 ) .",
    "as stated in the previous sections , in both limits particles distribute uniformly , so that investigating the collision kernel reduces to understanding the statistics of velocity differences .    following saffman and turner@xcite , in smooth flows and for @xmath192",
    "the collision kernel can be expressed as @xmath194 this is obtained by multiplying the geometrical cross section @xmath195 with the typical velocity difference between the two particles .",
    "the latter is approximated by @xmath196 , being @xmath197 the characteristic fluid velocity gradient ; in turbulent flows the latter is usually estimated as @xmath198 .    for @xmath193 ,",
    "it was suggested by abrahamson@xcite that the kernel can be obtained by a molecular - chaos type of argument , because positions and velocities of particles are uncorrelated : @xmath199 where @xmath200 .    in the last few years",
    "most of theoretical efforts focused on the intermediate regime , for which many models and predictions have been proposed .",
    "for example , in the regime @xmath4 of very small stokes numbers , collision rates are enhanced solely by preferential concentration through an increase in the probability of having particles at a colliding distance .",
    "this was indeed demonstrated by means of dns and theoretical analysis.@xcite thus most of the efforts focused in predicting the net effect of clustering.@xcite this is surely crucial for ( close to ) monodisperse suspensions of particles with very small sizes , but this approach can not catch collisions between particles with different sizes .",
    "moreover , even for same - size particles , as soon as the stokes number reaches small but finite values , inertia besides increasing the probability to find close particles also enhances particle relative velocities .",
    "this is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : d2_gamma ] where we see that , as @xmath0 approaches the value where clustering is maximal , the particle velocity difference is no more proportional to the particle separation .",
    "this leads to an additional increase in the collision rates . indeed , from comparisons with dns ,",
    "et al._@xcite argued that most models are not able to accurately predict the relative velocity .",
    "as to collisions between particles having different sizes the situation is even more involved .",
    "clearly as soon as the stokes number difference is not negligible the accumulation effect induced by inertia need to be understood in terms of correlations among particle positions belonging to different populations ( what we called correlations between different attractors ) .",
    "as far as we know , only few attempts in this direction have been considered . among them",
    "we mention zhou _",
    "et al._@xcite who investigated by means of dns , bidisperse suspensions in frozen turbulent flows . in their study",
    "they found a reduction of the accumulation effect and an increase in relative velocity .",
    "in particular , they proposed a simple model for the particle velocities correlation , in which they prescribed an extremely simplified fluid velocity correlation .",
    "though in fairly good agreement with simulations , their results are rather difficult to interpret because spatial correlations of the fluid velocity are not taken into account",
    ". moreover , their approach seems to be justified only for particle response time of the order of the correlation time of the large scales , @xmath201 .",
    "indeed , they consider in their numerical simulations particles with response times up to @xmath202 .",
    "also kruis and kusters@xcite proposed a model for bidisperse collisions . in their approach",
    "they separate , in a somehow artificial way ( as argued in ref .  ) , two contributions .",
    "the first named shear mechanism corresponds to the carrier fluid velocity shear , that is very similar to the saffman - turner result .",
    "the second , deriving from the acceleration induced by the different inertia , was called accelerative mechanism . also this model appear of difficult interpretation due to the absence of spatial correlation in its derivation . moreover ,",
    "both mechanisms are considered to be effective simultaneously and the dominance of one over the other is only due to intensity of the velocity gradients , while clearly the particle sizes should play a role too .    in the sequel , exploiting the results obtained in the previous sections , we propose a phenomenological model of the collision kernel which reduces to the known results in the two asymptotics of vanishing and very large stokes number . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "an interpolation between the two asymptotics naturally emerges in terms of the exponent @xmath203 that , ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2_gamma ] ) out of the two limiting regimes , can not be trivially related to @xmath90 . moreover , as we shall see , the identification of the crossover scale @xmath7 ( [ def : rstar ] ) provides a natural way to discern between differential acceleration and shear mechanisms . to be used for quantitative predictions an analytical estimation of @xmath203 would be needed .",
    "even for relatively simple random flows , this is far from the present capabilities .",
    "however , this quantity is accessible in simulations and may be in principle measured from experiments where particle tracking can be done with a high accuracy .    according to the different cases described in sec.[sec : diffstokes ] , the @xmath204 plane has to be divided into different regions corresponding to the various behaviors of @xmath205 evaluated at @xmath206 .",
    "three regions can be identified ( see fig .",

    "@xmath207- in the gray region defined by @xmath214 the behavior of the mean radial velocity difference is well approximated by the two - point motion of particles with the mean stokes number @xmath215 .",
    "the collision rate thus reduces to that of particles with the same stokes number , namely from eq .",

    "of course , close to the boundary of the hatched region , the constant @xmath223 should be suitably chosen to ensure continuity of the collision kernel @xmath191 in the plane @xmath224 .",
