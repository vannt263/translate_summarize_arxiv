    "predictive power of the density functional theory,@xcite mostly in its local density ( lda ) and gradient corrected ( gga ) flavors , is the main factor that has established this method as the standard approach in the materials science . for many electronic systems ,",
    "it has become possible to predict very accurately the equilibrium geometry , equation of state , relevant energetics , and further whole plethora of properties with astonishingly good accuracy .",
    "unfortunately , all these approximations are plagued by the fact that functionals contain spurious self - interaction and the electronic states are typically too extended . therefore , the reliable predictions for systems with very localized electronic density , so called strongly - correlated systems , require a computational scheme that cures the self - interaction problem . in some approximate way",
    ", the self - interaction is partially removed in the dft+u scheme,@xcite which corrects the coulomb potential within the localized states , such as @xmath2- and @xmath3-shells of atoms .",

    "the interesting and important examples include jahn - teller distortions , relaxations around defects , atomic reconstructions at interfaces , lattice distortions due to magnetic interactions , surface reconstructions and local adjustment of atomic positions at surfaces due to the adsoption of atoms and molecules , and finally clusters of atoms in nanoparticles .",
    "it is obvious that the possibility to calculate forces and stress tensor , in addition to the energy spectrum , consistently within the self - interaction free dft scheme is very desirable .",
    "however , unfortunately , the full equations for forces in the psic method have not been set up yet and only an attempt to calculate forces , albeit in a very approximate form , has been performed in the paper by filippetti and fiorentini.@xcite even these simplified equations for forces have not been tested so far in any system . only recently ,",
    "a new variational psic approach,@xcite different than the original psic approach of filippetti and spaldin,@xcite has been proposed .    in this work ,",
    "we provide a computational scheme that is based on the non - variational psic method,@xcite implementing it into widely used quantum espresso code@xcite using the plane - wave basis and employing ultrasoft pseudopotentials ( uspps).@xcite for this scheme , we also derive and implement the formulae for forces .",
    "it turns out that the procedure to calculate forces is similar to the one employed in the dft+u method.@xcite    the developed formalism is tested in a series of calculations for various systems .",
    "we calculate internal strain parameter @xmath4 for the wurzite zno and compare to the dft+u results for the norm - conserving ( ncpp ) and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials .",

    "the tm - si distances usually become slightly longer than the ideal si - si bond , except for the re - si - re bridge in the psic approach .",
    "this effect is important for the magnetic properties of silicon doped with re and will be published elsewhere .",
    "here , we only comment on the fact that , the rhenium ions in silicon have smaller magnetic moment ( 1 @xmath94 ) than the mn ions ( 3 @xmath94 ) , and therefore , rhenium employs more valence electrons for a hybridization with atoms of the host and with another close re ion . due to a larger localization of the d - shell electrons in re within the psic approach ,",
    "these states contribute much weaker to a hybridization between re - re , and this bond is much longer than in the gga method . a very interesting difference between si : mn and si : re is in the dos :",
    "the states , which are closer to the fermi level , originate from the closest neighbours of the impurity in the case of mn , and from the second close neighbours in the case of re .",
    "this fact gives one of the reasons why the 220 pair of re in si relaxes stronger than the 111 pair .",
    "we have derived the expressions for forces within the non - variational psic approach with ultrasoft pseudopotentials used to account for electron and ion interactions and implemented the scheme into the quantum espresso plane - wave code .",
    "first , we have performed benchmark calculations to check the internal consistency of the scheme for the wurzite zno and rare - earth @xmath3-electron compound ceo@xmath0 in the @xmath70 structure . in both cases ,",
    "the forces within the psic scheme vanish for the geometry corresponding to the minimum of the total energy .",
    "also optimization procedure within the code works perfectly bringing the initially distorted crystallographic structures of zno and ceo@xmath0 into the correct equilibrium geometry efficiently .",
    "further , we have performed calculation within the psic approach to determine the geometry of distorted perovskites latio@xmath1 , ytio@xmath1 , and colossal magnetoresistance compound lamno@xmath1 in the @xmath5 structure , and also of silicon doped with pairs of mn and re ions .",
    "these systems have been chosen , since there are indications that the spurious self - interaction and resulting more diffused electronic states can lead to certain systematic errors .",
    "indeed , in the cases studied here , the psic results for geometry parameters are usually closer to the experimental ones than the parameters obtained from the standard approximations of the dft and the dft+u methods .",
    "this strongly suggests that the larger localization of the electronic states is better accounted for in the psic scheme , which could provide also more reliable predictions in many systems .",
    "also in the case of mn and re pairs in silicon , the geometries of the systems obtained within the psic and the gga differ considerably .",
    "effect of the psic relaxations is usually weaker than the gga ones , which is a consequence of weaker @xmath100-@xmath2 hybridization .",
    "an exception is the re - si - re configuration for which the re1(5d)-re2(5d ) interactions are strong and the psic relaxations are larger than those obtained from the gga method .    having functioning scheme to calculate forces within the psic method , the further studies are under way to determine the areas of relevant applications and deeper investigate the reliability of the method .",
