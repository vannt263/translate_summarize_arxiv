    "the standard theoretical framework for predicting phase diagrams and other thermodynamic properties of alloys requires an adequate representation of the formation enthalpy in the form of the ising model with effective cluster interaction parameters .",
    "@xcite the construction of such models is a major goal of the first - principles alloy theory . @xcite",
    "an important part of the effective configurational interaction in size - mismatched alloys comes from atomic relaxations .",
    "@xcite this strain - induced interaction is unavoidably long - range , because a local static disturbance in the atomic positions is propagated through the crystal by a response function with an anisotropic spectrum that is gapless thanks to the translational invariance .",
    "an adequate real - space cluster expansion of the strain - induced interaction is therefore often difficult to construct based on the structure inversion method.@xcite    two approaches have been widely used to represent the strain - induced interaction by an effective _ pairwise _ configurational interaction : the mixed - basis cluster expansion with the so - called constituent strain ( cs ) contribution , @xcite and the kanzaki - krivoglaz - khachaturyan model ( kkkm ) assuming configuration - independent force constants and kanzaki forces that are linear in occupation numbers.@xcite the long - range character of the strain - induced interaction is reflected in the orientation - dependent discontinuity at the @xmath6 point in reciprocal space .",
    "the cs approach determines the anisotropy of this singularity using the relaxation energies of coherent superlattices with infinitely separated parallel phase boundaries .",
    "the assumption of a purely pairwise strain - induced interaction in the entire concentration range appears to be an unavoidable and uncontrollable approximation in this approach . in the kkkm approach the full relaxation energy ( and not just its long - range limit )",
    "is described by an effective pairwise interaction , but its assumptions restrict its quantitative applicability to the case of a dilute alloy with configuration - independent force constants . in the dilute limit , first - principles calculations can be performed using large supercells with isolated impurities .",
    "@xcite however , interactions obtained for a dilute alloy can not generally be extended to the concentrated case .",
    "force constants in alloys were extensively studied in connection with phonon spectra and vibrational entropies , @xcite and they often depend strongly on the configuration .",
    "as we will show below , the kanzaki forces are strongly non - linear in occupation numbers in @xmath3-@xmath4 alloys , which we believe to be a generic situation .",
    "the general structure of the effective strain - induced interaction in the harmonic approximation involves an inverse of the force constant matrix contracted on both sides with the vector representing the kanzaki forces .",
    "this structure does not , in fact , depend on the simplifying assumptions made within the kkkm .",
    "however , if these assumptions are not satisfied , the effective interaction is by no means pairwise .",
    "@xcite a many - body representation of the kanzaki forces based on first - principles calculations was reported for the cu@xmath7au@xmath8 alloy system.@xcite however , the force constants were still assumed to be independent of the configuration , while the many - body representation of the kanzaki forces , as we show below , did not include the most important term beyond the traditional kkkm .    an alternative effective tetrahedron method @xcite assumes a strictly local but non - pairwise form for the interaction adapted to a particular crystal lattice .",
    "while useful in specific cases , particularly as an addition to the coherent potential calculations in which accurate forces are unavailable , this approximation is uncontrollable and does not aim to describe the singular part of the strain - induced interaction .",
    "an important general feature of the problem should also be emphasized .",
    "the assumption of the continuity of the crystal lattice implies that all the ensuing predictions will correspond to coherent phase transformations .",
    "it is a general property of such transformations in phase - separating alloys that the conventional concept of an equilibrium phase diagram , with unique boundaries of single - phase regions , is inapplicable .",
    "@xcite in particular , the concentrations of two phases in equilibrium depend not only on temperature , but also on the overall composition of the alloy .",
    "this dependence appears because the state of strain of the phases in equilibrium depends on their molar fractions ; the common tangent construction is invalid for coherently stressed solids because the elastic free energy is not a sum of contributions from the two phases .",
    "the convex hull in the formation enthalpy diagram likewise loses its clear meaning .",
    "it therefore appears to be unavoidable that a physically meaningful configurational hamiltonian of a coherently strained alloy should depend on its overall composition treated as a macroscopic parameter .",
    "the long - range character of the strain - induced interaction presents an obstruction to any local representation of this dependence .",
    "the commonly used methods mentioned above do not respect this general feature . in particular , although the pairwise interaction potential in the cs approach does depend on the concentration , in practical applications it is usually combined with a semi - grand canonical monte carlo simulation , which relaxes the condition of fixed overall concentration and yields a universal phase diagram .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the kkkm based on controlled cluster expansions for both kanzaki forces and force constants that can be constructed using first - principles calculations . this configuration - dependent lattice deformation model ( cldm )",
    "is designed to capture the _ many - body _ strain - induced interaction on all length scales .",
    "the configurational hamiltonian by construction corresponds to a fixed overall composition .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the cldm model is formulated in section [ sec : model ] , and section [ methods ] explains the computational methods .",
    "the subsequent sections report on the application of cldm to cu - au and fe - pt alloys .",
    "the cluster expansions for the kanzaki forces and force constants are described in sections [ sec : forces ] and [ sec : fc ] , respectively .",
    "the relaxation energies predicted by cldm are discussed in section [ harmrelaxationen ] .",
    "section [ striction ] deals with the role of striction ( homogeneous strain ) , and section [ anharmonic ] with the anharmonicity .",
    "the phonon spectra for ordered and disordered alloys are calculated and compared with experiment in section [ sec : phonons ] .",
    "the auxiliary cluster expansion for the relaxation energy is presented in section [ auxce ] , and the the effective pair interaction for a nearly random alloy is analyzed in section [ sec : veff ] .",
    "the phase transitions are found using monte carlo simulations in section [ mcresults ] .",
    "finally , the conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we describe the configuration - dependent lattice deformation model ( cldm ) , which generalizes the kanzaki - krivoglaz - khachaturyan model to concentrated alloys and may be readily constructed using first - principles data .",
    "the accuracy of the model can be systematically improved .",
    "the present formulation is restricted to the harmonic approximation ; the errors due to anharmonicity are discussed later in section [ anharmonic ] .      following the standard approach , @xcite we start from the separation of the formation enthalpy of an ordered structure in two contributions : the `` chemical '' part @xmath9 corresponding to all atoms fixed at ideal positions of the parent lattice , and the relaxation part @xmath10 associated with displacements away from these ideal positions : @xmath11 where we used @xmath12 to denote the configuration of the ( generally multi - component ) alloy , i.  e.  occupations of all lattice sites by atoms of different types , and @xmath13 to denote the displacements of all atoms from their ideal positions .",
    "while @xmath9 usually presents no problems for a conventional cluster expansion , our focus is on the difficult part @xmath10 . in the harmonic approximation",
    "it can be written as : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the force acting on the atom at site @xmath16 in the unrelaxed state , and @xmath17 is the configuration - dependent force constant matrix .",
    "using the fact that the energy must be invariant with respect to global translations after any deformation , one can show @xmath18    to proceed , we will construct cluster expansions for the forces @xmath19 and force constants @xmath20 .",
    "it is natural to expect that these expansions should quickly converge in real space .",
    "a first - principles cluster expansion of the kanzaki forces for cu@xmath5au alloys was undertaken by shchyglo _",
    "@xcite based on the fit of the total energies , but , as we will see below , one of the dominant terms was missed , and the resulting expansion does not provide an adequate representation of the forces .",
    "configuration - dependent force constants have been extensively studied from first principles to understand the role of vibrational entropy in the thermodynamics of phase transitions.@xcite it was found that the force constants in the equilibrium configuration depend strongly on the bond lengths due to anharmonicity , and this dependence is often taken into account by introducing explicit distance dependence . in the present treatment",
    "the situation is simpler , because the relaxation energy ( [ hrel ] ) is defined with respect to the ideal lattice , in which all the bond lengths are equal .",
    "thus , based on the earlier studies one may expect that a small number of configuration - dependent terms is sufficient to adequately represent the force constants in ( [ hrel ] ) , and below we will show this to be the case in cu - au and fe - pt alloys .",
    "we will also see that the anharmonic terms have a relatively small effect on the relaxation energies ( particularly for the configurations where these energies are not too large ) , even though the harmonic force constants referenced from the equilibrium configuration may deviate significantly from those in ( [ hrel ] ) .",
    "the force term can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the contribution to the force acting on site @xmath16 occupied by atom of type @xmath23 due to the occupation of a cluster @xmath24 , represented by the projection operator @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the occupation number of site @xmath27 by component @xmath28 , and the definition of cluster @xmath24 includes the set of sites and atom types occupying them .",
    "( @xmath29 if site @xmath16 is occupied by atom type @xmath23 or 0 otherwise . )",
    "it is assumed that @xmath24 does not contain @xmath16 in ( [ fi ] ) .    in an @xmath30-component alloy",
    "there are @xmath31 independent occupation numbers for each site .",
    "one of the original variables @xmath32 may be eliminated using @xmath33 , or one can introduce a different set of @xmath31 variables linearly related to @xmath32 . for a binary alloy",
    "a - b it is convenient to use ising variables @xmath34 ; in general there are @xmath35 of @xmath31 flavors @xmath36 .",
    "expressing all the occupation numbers in ( [ fi ] ) through @xmath35 ( and omitting the summation over flavors needed in the multi - component case ) , we obtain @xmath37 where the cluster @xmath24 now can contain site @xmath16 , and @xmath38 . the sum in ( [ fi2 ] ) does not include the empty cluster , because this term would correspond to a macroscopic force acting on the entire crystal .    since for any set of @xmath39 the total energy should be translationally invariant ,",
    "the forces satisfy the condition @xmath40 to each cluster @xmath24 one can formally assign a displacement @xmath41 . for a single - atom cluster",
    "this should obviously be the displacement of the corresponding atom .",
    "for multi - atom clusters one can , for example , take the average displacement of the atoms included in @xmath24 . using ( [ transl ] )",
    ", we can then rewrite the linear term in ( [ hrel ] ) as @xmath42 or @xmath43 where @xmath44 with a sum over all clusters @xmath24 containing site @xmath27 , and @xmath45 is the number of sites in @xmath24 .    in view of the structure of @xmath46 , the forces",
    "may always be taken to be antisymmetric with respect to indices @xmath16 , @xmath27 , i.  e.  @xmath47 .",
    "this property will be assumed in the remainder of this section ; it means that the quantity @xmath48 can be interpreted as the force exerted by site @xmath27 on site @xmath16 in the configuration @xmath12 , which obeys newton s third law .",
    "however , when we consider specific alloy systems in the following , it is more convenient to introduce the expansion directly for @xmath15 , simply requiring that the condition ( [ transl ] ) is satisfied .",
    "in addition to the translational invariance ( [ transl ] ) , the condition of rotational invariance must be imposed , which requires that the total torque acting on the crystal vanishes in any configuration : @xmath49    let us further discuss the symmetry properties of the expansion .",
    "consider a particular term @xmath50 in the expansion for @xmath15 .",
    "the vector @xmath50 can always be chosen to be invariant under the subgroup @xmath51 of the point group @xmath52 of site @xmath16 that leaves the cluster @xmath24 invariant ( while possibly permuting some of its sites ) .",
    "therefore , if we consider the natural representation of @xmath51 in @xmath53 , the dimension of its invariant subspace @xmath54 gives the number of components of @xmath50 that may be independently varied . introducing a basis @xmath55 that spans @xmath54 , we write @xmath56 and coefficients @xmath57 play the role of the fitting parameters .",
    "( note that in addition to crystal symmetry they are subject to conditions ( [ transl ] ) and ( [ rotation ] ) . ) consider now two clusters @xmath24 and @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 . since they differ only in the presence of site @xmath16 , the groups @xmath51 and @xmath61 are identical , and so are the corresponding invariant subspaces @xmath54 and @xmath62 .",
    "we are therefore free to select the same basis @xmath55 for @xmath54 and @xmath62 and rewrite ( [ fi2 ] ) as @xmath63 where the prime indicates that the summation is taken over clusters @xmath24 that do not contain @xmath16 .",
    "this representation is very convenient in applications .",
    "note that the terms @xmath64 were not included in ref .  .",
    "we will see below that the nearest - neighbor quadratic term @xmath65 is comparable in magnitude to the conventional kanzaki term @xmath66 , representing a large asymmetry of the forces with respect to the interchange of the two components ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "we will be dealing with relaxed or unrelaxed configurations of ions in supercells , for which one can calculate energies , forces , and strains from first principles .",
    "for each supercell of any particular ordering the displacement of basis atom @xmath16 can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the symmetric strain tensor , @xmath70 is the coordinate of the origin , and @xmath71 is the periodic ( internal ) part of the displacement of basis atom @xmath16 ( determined with respect to the homogeneously deformed ideal lattice ) .",
    "the general deformation can be written as ( [ displ ] ) , because the antisymmetric part of the homogeneous deformation is an inconsequential uniform rotation of the lattice .    substituting the displacement",
    "( [ displ ] ) into ( [ hrel ] ) and taking into account ( [ hrel3 ] ) , we find the general expression @xmath72 where @xmath73 . if the total energy corresponding to the volume of one supercell is required , the sum over @xmath16 in ( [ hrel5 ] ) should be taken over all the basis sites in the supercell .",
    "( notice that in the last term @xmath74 then becomes the internal basis vector . )",
    "the sum over @xmath27 is , however , taken over all the sites in the infinite lattice , whose range is limited by the range of the kanzaki forces and the dynamical matrix .",
    "energy per site is obtained by dividing by the number of basis sites .",
    "the configurational dependence of the force constants leads to the presence of a bilinear coupling between the homogeneous strain @xmath69 and lattice relaxations @xmath71 .",
    "it implies that the forces change under a homogeneous strain deformation even if the atoms remain at their ideal lattice positions .",
    "conversely , the stress tensor changes as the atomic positions are relaxed .",
    "these features are obvious in first - principles calculations but absent from from traditional kkkm based on the assumption of configuration - independent force constants .",
    "the equilibrium conditions are obtained by minimizing @xmath10 with respect to @xmath71 and @xmath69 .",
    "this means that the forces : @xmath75\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , and the stress tensor @xmath77 vanish in equilibrium .",
    "the term with @xmath78 in @xmath79 is independent on the choice of the origin thanks to the invariance properties of the dynamical matrix .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath79 is equal to the physical stress tensor only if the internal displacements @xmath71 correspond to vanishing forces .    in the harmonic approximation",
    "the equilibrium conditions derived above are linear in @xmath71 and @xmath69 . for any ordered configuration of the alloy ( i.  e.  with any finite unit cell )",
    "the number of variables and equations is finite .",
    "the solution is unique up to a homogeneous translation , which can be explicitly excluded . by solving the linear equilibrium conditions and substituting the solutions back into @xmath10",
    ", one can calculate the relaxation energy of the given configuration as a function of the parameters appearing in the cluster expansions for the kanzaki forces and force constants .    in this work we concentrate on evaluating the relaxation energy for alloys with concentration near a certain chosen value .",
    "further , in calculations based on cldm we exclude the contribution of the homogeneous strain induced by ordering ( i.  e.  striction ) by setting @xmath80 .",
    "( the role of striction for the alloys considered here is discussed in section [ striction ] . )",
    "the equilibrium atomic displacements under this restriction are @xmath81    for a supercell with @xmath82 atoms , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are @xmath85-dimensional column vectors representing all the force and displacement components .",
    "although the matrix @xmath86 has three zero eigenvalues corresponding to homogeneous translations , its inversion is easily conditioned by adding a fictitious finite stiffness associated with the displacement of the whole crystal . as a result",
    ", the displacements of all basis sites obtained from ( [ waf ] ) automatically add up to zero .",
    "substituting @xmath84 in @xmath10 , one finds the relaxation energy @xmath87 where the matrix @xmath86 should be conditioned before inversion as explained above .",
    "( [ erel ] ) is _ exact _ in the harmonic approximation .",
    "since both @xmath88 and @xmath86 are represented by cluster expansions , the resulting interaction is by no means pairwise , contrary to the commonly used form of kkkm .",
    "in fact , if the configuration dependence of the force constants is taken into account , it contains interactions or arbitrarily high order .",
    "one can , in principle , expand @xmath89 in the occupation variables with respect to some `` average - alloy '' reference point and obtain an infinite sequence of many - body interactions , each of which is long - range and inherits the long - distance singularity of the dynamical matrix . on the other hand , even in the dilute alloy limit the configurational dependence of the force constants is important .",
    "@xcite this can be immediately seen from the extreme case when the force constants binding the impurity atom to its neighbors are much larger compared to the host material . in this limit",
    "the equilibrium displacements of the neighbors induced by the kanzaki forces , and thereby the strain - induced interaction , are suppressed .",
    "as we will see in the following , in @xmath3-@xmath4 alloys like cu - au and fe - pt the asymmetry between the components leads to large two - body terms in the kanzaki forces and thereby to significant non - pairwise strain - induced interactions  even if the configurational dependence of @xmath86 is disregarded .",
    "this feature reveals the intrinsic limitation of the methods designed to describe the strain - induced interaction using pairwise configurational interaction .",
    "for applications we have chosen cu  au and fe  pt as typical and well - studied @xmath3-@xmath4 alloy systems .",
    "due to a fairly large size mismatch ( 13% and 10% , respectively ) , strain - induced interaction in these systems is comparable with the chemical contribution and competes with it , which makes them appropriate for the application of cldm .    in this work",
    "we focus on constructing an accurate representation of the lattice relaxation energy at a fixed overall composition of the alloy .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this representation is generally suitable for the description of coherent phase transformations in combination with thermodynamic simulations in the canonical ensemble . for ordering phase transitions occurring with a narrow two - phase region",
    "( e.  g.  close to a point of equal concentration ) or through a second - order transition the requirement of a canonical ensemble simulation is not critical .",
    "the cu - au phase diagram has points of equal concentration near cuau and cu@xmath5au compositions , while fe - pt alloys have points of equal concentration near fe@xmath5pt , fept , and fept@xmath5 compositions .",
    "the low - temperature phases have l1@xmath90 and l1@xmath91 orderings .",
    "the cu - au system also has an l1@xmath91-ordered cuau@xmath5 phase terminating at a peritectic point .",
    "thus , for both alloy systems construct effective configurational hamiltonians at three concentrations of 25% , 50% , and 75% .",
    "the input sets for 50% concentration consisted of all 27 ordered structures with up to 6 atoms in the unit cell . for the @xmath92 compositions the input sets included all 7 structures with 4-atom unit cells and 25 structures with 8-atom unit cells .",
    "the latter included the total of 9 superlattices with a@xmath93b@xmath91 , a@xmath94bab , and a@xmath95ba@xmath91b stackings along [ 100 ] , [ 110 ] , and [ 111 ] directions , which were used in ref .  .",
    "in some calculations we also added a 16-atom special quasirandom structure ( sqs16 ) in each set .",
    "total energy calculations were performed using the projected augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite and the pbesol @xcite exchange - correlation functional as implemented in the vasp package .",
    "@xcite the choice of pbesol was motivated by the fact that it gives the lattice parameter of au in much better agreement with experiment compared to pbe .",
    "an energy cutoff of 350 ev was used for the plane - wave basis set , and the reciprocal - space integration was performed on a @xmath6-centered mesh with a density equivalent to at least @xmath96 points in the cubic brillouin zone of the parent fcc lattice .",
    "structural optimizations were performed using the conjugate - gradient algorithm and the methfessel - paxton smearing scheme .",
    "the cldm parameters are determined from the calculated forces for all input structures calculated either with ideal atomic positions or with small displacements of individual atoms , as explained in the following two sections .",
    "all these calculations were performed with an ideal shape and volume of the unit cell for the following lattice parameters : 3.688   for 25% au , 3.819 and 3.897   for 50% au , and 3.955   for 75% au in the cu - au system , and 3.679  , 3.769  , and 3.850   for the same concentrations of pt in the fe - pt system .",
    "note that we used two different lattice parameters for the cu@xmath97au@xmath97 system in order to check the sensitivity of cldm to this choice .",
    "the first value 3.819   was chosen somewhat arbitrarily ( as they were for the other systems ) , while the other value 3.897   was designed to minimize the volume relaxation energies .",
    "this was done as follows . for each input structure",
    "@xmath98 the energy per atom @xmath99 was calculated and fitted as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "then the sum @xmath100 was minimized with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "we found that the choice of the lattice parameter has a small effect on the model parameters and thermodynamic properties , showing that a reasonably crude choice within 1 - 2% of equilibrium is acceptable .",
    "in this and subsequent sections we use first - principles data to construct cldm for cu - au and fe - pt alloys at three concentrations : 0.25 , 0.5 , and 0.75 . our first step is to parameterize the kanzaki forces based on the general expression ( [ fi3 ] ) . for each dataset",
    "we fitted the parameters of ( [ fi3 ] ) to the set of all hellman - feynman forces calculated for the unrelaxed ordered structures in the dataset .",
    "( this information is already available in a conventional cluster - expansion procedure , and we have checked that the calculated forces were sufficiently converged with respect to the energy cutoff and @xmath101-point density . )",
    "our strategy was to start with a list of 16 symmetry - respecting terms in the expansion , and for each dataset with a given alloy composition to include only those terms that appreciably reduced the cross - validation score for the forces .",
    "this procedure resulted in 7 - 8 terms for each dataset .",
    "the simplest cluster type is a single site @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a nearest neighbor of @xmath16 in the fcc ( or bcc ) lattice , the invariant subspace @xmath103 is one - dimensional , and the single basis vector @xmath104 is parallel to @xmath105 ( i.  e.  central force ) .",
    "the same applies to second , fourth , and fifth - nearest neighbors in the fcc lattice , but for third - nearest neighbors the invariant subspace is two - dimensional .",
    "we introduced an orthogonal basis for this two - dimensional subspace , with one of the basis vectors @xmath104 parallel to @xmath105 and representing a central force component , and the other basis vector @xmath106 .",
    "thus , 10 of the 16 trial terms represent central forces between pairs of atoms up to fifth - nearest neighbors , and one more term describes the non - central force from the third - nearest neighbor .",
    "the contribution of all these terms to @xmath15 is @xmath107 where @xmath108 for @xmath4-elements and @xmath109 for @xmath3-elements , and @xmath110 is the set of sites in the @xmath30-th coordination sphere of @xmath16 .",
    "note that the non - central term with @xmath111 would violate the condition ( [ rotation ] ) and is therefore excluded .",
    "@xmath112    the remaining five terms correspond to coplanar forces from two - site clusters @xmath113 : @xmath114\\sigma_j\\sigma_k\\mathbf{e}^i_{jk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is a unit vector pointing from the midpoint between @xmath27 and @xmath101 towards @xmath16 , and @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 are projectors selecting specific cluster shapes .",

    "for example , in the a@xmath91b@xmath91 [ 001 ] superlattice the calculated forces acting on cu and au atoms are 0.88 and 2.83 ev /  , respectively , and for the fe - pt superlattice they are 0.49 and 2.72 ev /  .",
    "this large asymmetry is properly described by our model . on the contrary , the model of ref .",
    "for cu@xmath5au does not include any of the @xmath136 parameters in eq .",
    "( [ fi2 ] ) , and the force acting on site @xmath16 does not depend at all on its occupation .",
    "therefore , that model ( which was fitted to the relaxation energies of a few ordered structures and is dominated by the @xmath66 term ) does not give an adequate representation of the kanzaki forces .",
    "configuration - dependent force constants have attracted much attention , motivated mainly by the need to understand the effects of vibrational entropy on the thermodynamics of phase transitions , as well as by the general interest in the effects of ordering on the vibrational spectra.@xcite however , to our knowledge , they have not been used in the studies of the strain - induced interaction .",
    "usually a configuration - independent force constant matrix is introduced and fitted to provide some reasonable elastic moduli . here",
    "we go beyond this approximation and construct a configuration - dependent representation of the force constant matrix using first - principles input data .",
    "note that the definition of the force constants suitable for the evaluation of the relaxation energies is different from those designed to describe the vibrational entropy .",
    "the former are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ hrel ] ) , where the reference state with @xmath137 corresponds to the ideal ( unrelaxed ) lattice , but the latter are defined with respect to the equilibrium ( relaxed ) state , which itself depends on the configuration .",
    "although in the harmonic approximation the two types of force constants are identical , anharmonic effects lead to a rather strong dependence of the force constants on bond lengths.@xcite therefore , we do not expect that the `` unrelaxed '' force constants obtained here are sufficiently accurate for the analysis of vibrational entropies or other sensitive measures of the physical vibrational spectra .",
    "they are , however , well - suited for the calculations of the relaxation energies , which is our present purpose . as will be further discussed in sec .",
    "[ anharmonic ] , in cu - au and fe - pt systems the deviations of the relaxation energy from the harmonic approximation are significant only in strongly relaxing configurations , which are statistically negligible in alloys that are not phase - separating . even in such configurations",
    "the effect on the relaxation energy is not very large and can be taken into account with the help of a simple rescaling correction .",
    "it is well - known that the force constants have to satisfy certain identities following from translational and rotational invariance of a crystal subjected to an arbitrary uniform strain and internal displacements.@xcite since these identities should be satisfied in each configuration of the alloy , each independent term in a cluster expansion for the force constants should satisfy all of them .",
    "a possible way of constructing such an expansion was suggested in ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , force constants corresponding to arbitrary central forces automatically satisfy all the invariance relations.@xcite we therefore used a simple parametrization , in which only central ( bond - stretching ) forces depend on the configuration , while the non - central force components are configuration - independent .",
    "we also limited the range of the force constants to second - nearest neighbors and assumed that the central force for bond @xmath138 depends only on the occupation of sites @xmath16 and @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting model has 9 parameters including 6 central - force constants ( 3 per coordination sphere : for a - a , b - b , and a - b bonds ) , 2 non - central force constants for nearest neighbors , and 1 isotropic non - central constant for second - nearest neighbor .",
    "we also tested more complicated force constant models and found that , although they improve the fitting of the forces induced by lattice displacements , there is little or no improvement in the prediction of the relaxation energies for the systems we have considered",
    ".    there may be different strategies for the fitting of the force constant model .",
    "for example , one might evaluate the force constants for each input structure and fit them to a model with configuration dependence . however , for relatively simple structures with a small number of atoms per unit cell , the calculation of force constants requires the use of enlarged supercells , which is computationally inefficient . in order to avoid this complication",
    ", we adopted a different approach , facilitated by the fact that our input sets at each composition contain a fairly large number of structures ( more than 20 ) .",
    "for each input structure we calculate the extra forces appearing when one of the atoms is displaced in one of the three cartesian directions . for this purpose",
    "we employed the standard procedure implemented in the vasp code , in which all such inequivalent displacements are automatically generated .",
    "while for any given structure this calculation provides information only about the @xmath6-point phonons and is usually insufficient to fix all the force constants , we expect that the inclusion of a sufficient number of input structures of relatively small but different sizes and shapes should provide enough information for the fitting of the configuration - dependent force constant parameters .",
    "the magnitude of atomic displacements was taken to be 1% of the cubic lattice parameter , and displacements of both signs were included to reduce the fitting errors .",
    "the fit is then performed by linear regression for the set of equations @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the ( kanzaki ) force acting on the atom at site @xmath16 in the unrelaxed state with @xmath141 .",
    "the resulting fit of the configuration - dependent force constants is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fc ] , along with a similar fit in which the force constants were restricted to be configuration - independent ( as it is done in the kkkm ) .",
    "it is seen that the calculated forces are reproduced quite well by a model with configuration - dependent force constants , but the neglect of the configurational dependence results in poor fits for all datasets .",
    "the fitted force - constant parameters are listed in table [ tab : fcs ] .",
    "note that the notation for first nearest neighbor force constants is given in a rotated reference frame to isolate the central forces . specifically , for a ( 1/2,1/2,0 ) bond , the axes are rotated by @xmath142 around the @xmath143 axis so that the axis @xmath144 lies along the ( 1,1,0 ) direction , parallel to the bond .",

    "since our representation of the forces and force constants does not provide an adequate mapping of the stress tensor within cldm , for this system we utilized an additional real - space cluster expansion to represent the striction part of the formation enthalpy @xmath152 ( in the notation of section [ striction ] ) .",

    "this means that the average occupations are @xmath153 where @xmath154 are small .",
    "the effective interaction potential is then defined as : @xmath155 if the energy is represented by a many - body real - space cluster expansion , the effective potential can be readily calculated : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the multiplicity factor of cluster type @xmath24 , @xmath45 is the number of sites in @xmath24 , and @xmath158 the number of edges of @xmath24 that are equivalent by symmetry to the pair @xmath159 .",

    "therefore , the auxiliary cluster expansion fit is insensitive to the behavior of the effective interaction in the vicinity of the @xmath6 point . in this small region in the brillouin zone the interactions are shown by dotted lines in fig .

    "[ fig : veff ] that in most cases the plots of @xmath162 for the strain - induced contribution display abrupt turns near the @xmath6 point where the fit can no longer capture the @xmath163 dependence correctly .",

    "in the previous sections we have been occupied with the construction of configurational hamiltonians including the relaxation energy , and now we are ready to examine the thermodynamic properties .",
    "the configurational hamiltonian in our approach corresponds to a fixed overall composition .",
    "it is thus potentially suitable for the prediction of coherent phase transformations in a fixed - concentration alloy in a typical quench - and - anneal experiment as long as the thermodynamic simulations are also performed at a fixed composition , i.  e.  within the canonical ensemble . as it was mentioned in the introduction , this general scheme ( composition - dependent hamiltonian plus particle - conserving thermodynamic or kinetic simulation ) appears to be necessary on general physical grounds for the description of a coherent phase transformation involving phase separation .",
    "the procedure developed in this work is , however , not ready for this purpose , because in a phase - separated state the crucial long - range part of the elastic interaction is not captured by the auxiliary cluster expansion . clearly , a more sophisticated approximation to the cldm relaxation energy is necessary that would both represent the long - range many - body interaction faithfully and either be computable at the rate required in monte carlo simulations or be amenable to a reasonably accurate statistical approximation ( such as a suitably adapted cluster variation method ) .",
    "another issue is the difficulty in describing the homogeneous strain within cldm , which we have discussed above .",
    "as long as the computational cell is filled by all possible domain types of the product phases , the macroscopic symmetry of the disordered phase is not broken .",
    "if the latter is cubic , the traceless part of the uniform strain tensor vanishes .",
    "in this situation , which is typical at early stages of a kinetic monte carlo simulation , the homogeneous strain problem is not of major importance .",
    "however , when the domain size becomes comparable with the size of the computational cell ( which is typical in monte carlo simulations ) , the homogeneous strain can generally not be ignored .",
    "we leave these problems for future studies .",
    "our present goal is , however , more modest : we are interested in finding the ordering phase transitions at compositions that are close to the points of equal concentration in the phase diagrams . in this situation",
    "the long - range part of the interaction is of minor importance , and we expect the auxiliary cluster expansion to be quite adequate .",
    "once the cldm expression for the relaxation energy has been replaced by the finite - range auxiliary cluster expansion , the choice of the statistical ensemble is of no consequence .",
    "therefore , the monte carlo simulations were performed using the efficient semi - grand canonical ensemble as implemented in the atat package .",
    "@xcite in this approach the chemical potential difference for the two components is fixed , and the temperature of the phase transition is signalled either by the discontinuity of the concentration or by a singularity in the heat capacity . for the present purposes we select the chemical potential in such a way that the phase transition occurs at the target concentration ( i.  e.  the same concentration at which the configurational hamiltonian has been constructed ) .",

    "the value of 740 k based on the optimized volume should be viewed as more reliable , because this choice reduces the errors due to anharmonicity .",
    "for cuau@xmath5 the simulation predicts phase separation at a temperature above 2000 k , which is not meaningful and clearly due to the failure of the auxiliary cluster expansion to capture the long - range part of the interaction . on the other hand , as mentioned in the introduction , the semi - grand canonical monte carlo simulation is also problematic for a system undergoing coherent phase separation . since the gga , in fact , fails to predict the ground state in this system , we did not attempt to improve its description .",
    "we have , however , checked that the cldm , in good agreement with first - principles calculations , predicts that several structures in the input set have energies below that of l1@xmath91 .",

    "note that the average volume relaxation in fept is only 1.3 mev ( see table [ tab : vshrel ] ) , and therefore the relative magnitude of the strain - induced interaction can not be materially reduced by selecting a different reference volume . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "the traditional kkkm was employed to estimate the strain - induced interaction in fept using the elastic constants of pt and the concentration expansion coefficient .",
    "the strain - induced interaction was found to be very small , only reducing @xmath164 by about 60 k. this drastic failure of kkkm shows that its uncontrolled approximations make it unsuitable even for rough estimates of the strain - induced interaction in concentrated @xmath3-@xmath4 alloys .",

    "this model has been applied to cu - au and fe - pt alloys , treating three compositions near 25% , 50% , and 75% as separate systems .",

    "however , the configuration - dependent stress is not adequately represented by the models , which may be due to the slow real - space convergence of the corresponding lattice sums . as a result , the contribution of striction ( i.  e.  relaxation of the unit cell shape ) must be included separately when it is important .",
    "the phonon spectra of random alloys based on the configurationally - dependent force constants are in good qualitative agreement with the available experimental data , but an accurate calculation of the vibrational entropy is not possible without the inclusion of anharmonic terms .    for further applications ,",
