    "microlens parallaxes measure a vector quantity , the `` projected velocity '' @xmath0 , which is the projection of the lens - source relative velocity on the plane of the observer .",
    "another way of writing this quantity is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lens - source relative parallax and proper motion .",
    "it is a useful quantity to measure because it depends only on the kinematic properties of the lens and source , and is independent of the mass .",
    "once it is measured , one can also determine the  projected einstein radius \" , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the  einstein timescale \" ( which is almost always well - measured ) and @xmath6 .",
    "hence , an ensemble microlens parallax measurements can distinguish statistically between different kinematic populations .",
    "microlensing parallax measurements are feasible with _ spitzer _ toward two classes of targets , the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) and the galactic bulge .",
    "the science cases and technical challenges are substantially different for the two classes .",
    "the nature of the microlensing events detected toward the magellanic clouds by the macho @xciteand eros @xcite collaborations is unknown .",
    "they are definitely too infrequent to make up most of the dark matter , but could make up of order 20% .",
    "the basic problem is that , while a few of the lenses have special properties that allow their distances to be determined , for most lenses it is not known whether they are in the milky way ( mw ) halo , the mw disk , or in the clouds themselves . while it would be tempting to use the lenses with known locations to address this question , actually the very properties that allow their distances to be measured predispose them to be in the clouds or the mw , so they do not constitute a fair sample",
    ". it would be better to find a way to choose  typical \" events , not selected by any characteristic , and determine their position .",
    "_ spitzer _ has already been used to measure the microlens parallax of one lens .",
    "@xcite found that its projected velocity was @xmath7 , which is typical of halo lenses , but much bigger than expected for mw disk lenses and much smaller than expected for smc lenses .",
    "however , they also found that ( with no priors on the location or properties of the lens ) that it could be in the smc with 5% probability .",
    "thus , to draw rigorous scientific conclusions , it will be necessary to obtain parallaxes for at least 3 , and more comfortably 5 , such events .",
    "@xcite conducted a systematic analysis of what could be learned about lenses observed toward the bulge by obtaining parallaxes for an ensemble of them .",
    "they found that such parallaxes greatly enhance microlensing as a probe of the stellar mass function .",
    "for example , comparing the precision of mass estimates ( for lenses assumed to be in the disk in both cases ) , they found that without parallaxes the masses could be individually  measured \" with a @xmath8 precision of 0.6 dex ( so , essentially no measurement ) whereas with parallaxes , the uncertainty was reduced to 0.2 dex .",
    "of particular interest would be to measure the frequency of disk brown dwarfs ( bds ) .",
    "of course , bds can be directly detected , but only while they are young , so that inferences about their global frequency depend sensitively on both their history of formation and their assumed cooling properties .",
    "it would be nice to constrain their frequency based solely on their mass .",
    "the main characteristic of disk bds from a parallax standpoint is that they have small @xmath9 ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : retilde ] ] ) .",
    "for example , a bd with @xmath10 and distance @xmath11kpc would have @xmath12 . in order for an m dwarf with mass @xmath13 to produce the same @xmath9 would require a distance @xmath14kpc .",
    "this is much less likely , but of course not impossible .",
    "so an ensemble of measurements would be needed to estimate to estimate the bd frequency .",
    "in fact , as i will discuss in the   [ sec : bulgetech ] , parallax measurements are actually easier for lenses with smaller @xmath9 ( up to a point ) .",
    "spitzer _ is well - placed to probe this key regime .",
    "the technical challenges in the two directions differ significantly , although they are related .",
    "as mentioned , there is already one _ spitzer _ microlens parallax toward the clouds , which is a proof of concept .",
    "however , the source was an @xmath15 clump giant ( i.e. , quite cool , so large @xmath16 ) , which is what permitted excellent photometry with just 2 hours of integration time in each of the four measurements required .",
    "such microlensing sources toward the clouds are extremely rare ( this was the only one detected so far during the entire _ spitzer _",
    "mission ) . to obtain the 35 events that are needed for the science goal ,",
    "requires acceptance of more typical turnoff stars , which are both fainter and bluer , and hence demand integration times that are 1020 times longer .",
    "such integrations were prohibitive for cold _ spitzer _ but might be possible for warm _ spitzer _ when the observatory is under less severe demand .",
    "if we imagine an average of 60 hours per event for 4 events , this would take about 250 hours over 4 years .",
    "note that the individual exposures can not be made any longer than the 27 second exposures for the clump giant because of artifacts from very bright stars .",
    "here there are many challenges .",
    "first , because the bulge is near the ecliptic , it can only be observed for two 38-day periods per year ( in late spring and late autumn ) .",
    "moreover , the autumn window is almost useless for microlensing because no events can be discovered then from the ground .",
    "second , in contrast to the clouds , a large number of events must be monitored to obtain scientifically interesting results , close to 50 and preferably 100 .",
    "third , there are technical challenges related to reconciling ground - based and _ spitzer _ photometry .",
    "this is a classic problem first discussed by @xcite .",
    "basically , unlike trigonometric parallax , microlens parallax is actually a vector , @xmath17 , which is related to observations by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the measured difference in times of peak of the event as seen from _ spitzer _ and the ground , @xmath20 is the measured difference in the impact parameter , and @xmath21 is the magnitude of the earth-_spitzer _ separation vector projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "the problem is that while @xmath19 can be robustly measured ( because the time of the peak can be read directly from the lightcurve ) , @xmath22 from each observatory is much harder to measure because it is a fit parameter that is partially degenerate with the amount of blended light .",
    "@xcite showed this degeneracy could be strongly constrained by arranging for the space and ground observatories to have identical cameras ( and so identical blending ) but that is obviously impossible for _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "@xcite evaded this problem by making _",
    "responsible only for measuring the first component of @xmath17 : the events toward the clouds are long enough that the acceleration of the earth toward the sun ( roughly perpendicular to _ spitzer _ ) allowed ground - based measurement of the other component .",
    "however , most events toward the galactic bulge are too short to make this trick work .    in order to understand whether the first two challenges can be overcome , i plotted ( not shown ) , all 90 ogle events that peaked during a random 38-day period in spring 2007 , with events plotted in red before they were alerted and in black afterward .",
    "events must be alerted before peak or it is impossible to measure @xmath23 from _ spitzer_. the diagram proved to be quite a mess , but much of this mess is caused by 24 events that were alerted after peak because they are so faint .",
    "the remaining 66 events are shown in figure [ fig : ogle_poss ] . based on experience with _ spitzer _",
    "observations of the smc event , it should be possible to obtain better than 1% photometry in one hour exposures of events that reach @xmath24 .",
    "( the bulge sources are intrinsically bluer than the smc clump giant , but the fields are heavily reddened , so the _ observed _",
    "@xmath16 colors are similar .",
    ") there are 24 such events .",
    "hence , over 5 years , a sample of 120 events could yield measured parallaxes .    before addressing the challenge of aligning the photometry of the two observatories",
    ", one should take note of the bottom panel in figure [ fig : ogle_poss ] .",
    "it shows the earth-_spitzer _ separation projected onto the bulge , during each of the 5 38-day intervals of the warm _",
    "mission , red for the first year and blue for the last .",
    "the average value is about 0.6 au , about 2.5 times the leverage available for the smc event @xcite .",
    "this is important because , until the projected separation gets to be the same order as @xmath9 , the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement scales directly as the projected separation .    a possible approach to aligning the ground and _ spitzer",
    "_ photometry would be to obtain @xmath25 band images during the event from the ground with a high - resolution , large aperture telescope .",
    "such measurements would yield an accurate @xmath26 color , independent of blending . while @xmath27 is certainly not identical to _ spitzer _",
    "@xmath28 m , it should be possible to use this color , together with the colors of other stars in the image , to align the two photometry systems based on stars of similar color .",
    "only empirical testing will determine whether this is a practical method .",
    "one potential problem with this approach is that there may not be enough bright bluish stars to perform the alignment for the ( typically bluish turnoff ) stars that dominate the event rate . in this case",
    ", one might be forced to stick with the brighter stars , which comprise 7 stars in the interval shown in figure [ fig : ogle_poss ] .",
    "even if it proves difficult to measure @xmath20 very accurately , it is important to point out that for one of the most interesting applications , the bd mass function , @xmath20 does not have to be measured with great precision .",
    "with typical @xmath29 and @xmath30 , measurements of @xmath20 accurate to 0.1 would be quite adequate .",
    "finally , there is the question of the practical organization of bulge observations .",
    "target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations are notoriously disruptive , and the warm _ spitzer _",
    "mission is likely to have a lower level of staff support to deal with these disruptions than the cold mission does .",
    "however , given the very large number of observations required during each 38-day observing  season \" , it should be possible apply the concept [ originally developed for the _ space interferometry mission ( sim ) _ ] of a  regular too \" or rtoo ( as opposed to a  disruptive too \" or dtoo ) . for an rtoo ,",
    "one plans in advance to make observations of the bulge for a designated set of times , but without specifying exactly what the targets are .",
    "then a day or so before the observations , instructions are uploaded to the spacecraft specifying the targets .",
    "if it really proves possible to measure 24 targets , and each one requires 7 1-hr measurements ( plus 1 baseline measurement that can be done at leisure during the autumn 38-day interval ) , then this amounts to 168 hours of observing over 38 days , or about 18% of observing time during this interval .",
    "all of these observations could be scheduled in advance , without knowing what the targets were ."
