    "gauge symmetries and their systematic construction , while being of great significance , is fraught with subtleties . they must be off - shell , i.e. the action should remain invariant under them without use of any equations of motion and there are systematic algorithms for construction of such off - shell symmetries @xcite . in models of gravity obtained by gauging poincare symmetries , it is however seen that such systematic approaches yield the poincare symmetries only on - shell .",
    "so , at the off - shell level , it appears that there are two independent set of symmetries .",
    "this is unsettling .",
    "we would then be required to find additional independent first - class constraints to support these symmetries . however , physically the only independent symmetries present are the space - time translations and lorentz boosts , i.e. the poincare symmetries .",
    "we set up the model in the poincare gauge theory ( pgt ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the global poincare symmetries on a set of global coordinates @xmath0 are localised at every spacetime point by introducing local frames having coordinates @xmath1 .",
    "both sets are 3-dimensional for our model , though the construction can be carried out in any dimensions .",
    "to change physical variables from one set of coordinates to another , triad fields are introduced , which are defined through @xmath2 here ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath4 ' are the metrics of the global and local sets of coordinates , respectively and ` @xmath4 ' is the standard minkowskian metric with signature @xmath5 .",
    "now , to keep the invariance of the theory , a gauge connection field ` @xmath6 ' is introduced through a newly defined gauge covariant derivative . for an arbitrary vector @xmath7 , the derivative is written as @xmath8 the corresponding field strengths give rise to gravitational fields @xmath9 b^i_{\\ \\rho } = \\epsilon^i_{\\ jk } r^j_{\\ \\mu\\nu } b^k_{\\ \\rho}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 defines the riemann .",
    "similarly , the commutator of @xmath11 derivatives give rise to the torsion @xmath12 it must be emphasised that this is a setting in the riemann - cartan spacetime rather than the riemann spacetime of usual general relativity .",
    "in general it contains torsion , which goes to zero only after imposition of the connection variable s equation of motion , giving back the torsion free riemannian manifold of general relativity .",
    "the poincare symmetries of the basic fields are @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 parametrizes local lorentz rotations and @xmath15 local coordinate translations .",
    "they together constitute the @xmath16 independent poincare symmetries in 3d .",
    "these symmetries are independent of the particular action being considered , so long as they are constructed in a proper tensorial manner .",
    "now , symmetries of an action can be constructed via a hamiltonian analysis through completely off - shell procedures , as stated before .",
    "after this is carried out , we find the symmetries which keeps the action invariant , as expected . however they can not be identified with the poincare symmetries , even after an appropriate field - dependent redefinition of the symmetry parameters .",
    "the clue of identification , as we show , lies in ` trivial ' gauge symmetries @xcite .",
    "they are symmetries of the form @xmath17 which keep any action _ off - shell _ invariant due to antisymmetry in the coefficients @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath19 without depending on the form of the euler derivatives @xmath20 and without requiring the imposition of the equations of motion @xmath21    in what follows , we take up the mielke - baekler model , summarise its hamiltonian constraints , outline construction of an off - shell gauge generator and generate gauge symmetries .",
    "these are then compared with the poincare symmetries to see how the two may actually be equivalent .",
    "the mielke - baekler 3d topological gravity model with torsion @xcite along with a cosmological term is described by @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whose equations of motion are found by setting the euler derivatives to zero @xmath23 = 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\delta s}{\\delta \\omega^i_{\\ \\mu } } & = \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho } \\left [ \\alpha_3\\ , r_{i\\nu\\rho } + a\\ , t_{i\\nu\\rho } + \\alpha_4\\ , \\epsilon_{ijk}b^j_{\\ \\nu}b^k_{\\ \\rho } \\right ] = 0 . \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constraints in the above model are @xcite listed in table [ tab : constraints mb ]    l c c & first class @xmath24 & second class @xmath25 + primary & @xmath26 & @xmath27 , @xmath28 + secondary & @xmath29 & +    with the definitions @xmath30 - \\nabla_{\\!\\alpha } \\phi_i^{\\ \\alpha } + \\epsilon_{ijk}\\ , b^j_{\\ \\alpha } \\left ( p\\,\\phi^{k\\alpha } + q\\ , \\phi^{k\\alpha } \\right ) \\\\",

    "the symmetries of the basic variables are then obtained through @xmath34 where @xmath35 indicates dirac brackets obtained through elimination of the second class sector @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "now , we know that all the gauge parameters @xmath36 are not independent , as the number of independent gauge parameters must equal the number of independent primary first - class constraints . in the off - shell method that we adopt @xcite , the restriction on @xmath36 is obtained from the commutativity of gauge variations and time evolution @xmath37 explicit calculations @xcite yield the generator @xmath38\\right . \\\\",
    "\\left.+ \\dot{\\sigma}^i\\pi_i^{\\ 0 } + \\sigma^i\\left[\\bar{\\mathcal{k}_i}-\\varepsilon_{ijk}\\big(b^j_{\\ 0}\\,\\pi^{k0 } + \\omega^j_{\\ 0}\\,\\pi^{k0}\\big)\\right]\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are six independent gauge parameters .",
    "we are now ready to study the gauge symmetries of the model utilising this generator .",
    "the generator yields the following symmetries of the basic fields @xmath41 a first comparison of the two sets of symmetries and reveals that the hamiltonian symmetries are explicitly dependant on the coupling parameters of the various terms in the action , in contrast to the pgt symmetries . also , we note that the gauge parameters of the two symmetries are different .",
    "so we need to map the gauge parameters of into the pgt gauge parameters .",
    "this is achieved through the field dependent map @xcite @xmath42 using this map , the hamiltonian symmetries can be written in the form @xmath43 it may seem that the two symmetries are thus equivalent only on - shell . to show that this is not the case , we write out their form explicitly @xmath44 to cast the balance terms of @xmath45 into the form , we first write down the appropriate @xmath46 matrix : @xmath47 the anti - symmetry of the above structure can now be easily demonstrated .",
    "as an example , @xmath48    so , we see that indeed ` @xmath49 ' is of the required form for trivial gauge symmetries .",
    "thus the invariance of the action can now be achieved under these ` balance ' symmetries @xmath50 without the use of any equations of motion .",
    "hence we see , that from a canonical point of view , @xmath51 as their difference is just an un - physical ` trivial ' symmetry .",
