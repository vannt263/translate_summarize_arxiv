    "from the publicly available data , we consider the gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) with known redshifts and detected radio afterglows through march , 2009 . tables 14 collect the grbs with these properties which satisfy certain criteria .",
    "we demand that the energy of the initially detected gamma - ray burst in its rest frame be compatible with the energy range of the fermi gamma - burst monitor .",
    "this excludes the x - ray flashes grb 080109a and grb 020903a . to determine whether an observation of the radio flux is indeed a detected radio afterglow , we demand that the radio flux detection be within the error box of the location of the observed grb , that it not be a site of previously observed radio activity , and that it be significantly non - zero .",
    "we use the criterion employed by ref .",
    "@xcite and thus require that the radio observation be nonzero by three standard deviations or more to be termed a detection .",
    "such considerations exclude grb 030277a , grb 980425a , and grb 011130a .",
    "consequently , we find 53 grbs to consider , for which we report all detected radio frequencies of 75 ghz or less .",
    "we report the time of the initial detection of the grb and the time of the detection of a particular observation frequency @xmath128 in the associated radio afterglow ( ra ) .",
    "we calculate the time lag between the detection of a particular radio frequency and the initial detection of the grb from these quantities .",
    "remarks concerning the collected data are in order . a redshift marked with an means that no certainty has been reported in the work which determines it . in those cases ,",
    "we assume the uncertainty in the redshift to be plus or minus one unit in the last significant figure reported .",
    "the redshift we report for grb 021004a is the average of those reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the redshifts marked with a",
    ", the associated publication states that the reported redshift is either a lower limit or the `` likely '' value . in the particular case of grb 970508a , work in refinement of the upper bound on the red shift has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the frequency marked with a double ,",
    "observations were made in the frequency range from 14.5 ghz to 17.5 ghz .",
    "we also note which radio detections have lesser significance , so that detections with a significance between 3@xmath129 and 4@xmath129 are marked with a , whereas detections with a significance between 4@xmath129 and 5@xmath129 are marked with a . for time lags marked with a",
    ", we assume the uncertainty in the time lag to be plus or minus one unit in the last significant figure of the reported detection time of a particular radio frequency .",
    "if a radio frequency detection reports an observation time interval , the time lag is calculated from the midpoint of the time interval , and we take one half of the observation time as the uncertainty in the time lag . the ra time reported in these cases",
    "is that of the midpoint of the observation time .",
    "to realize the limits reported in the main body of our paper , we fit to eq .",
    "( 2 ) of that source .",
    "we find that large statistical scale factors must be employed to realize good fits to the data .",
    "this may stem , in part , from the circumburst environment , and , more generally , from time delay effects which arise from neither source effects nor propagation effects across the expanse of space .",
    "the nature of the circumburst environment of grb 050904a is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to study",
    "how our limits rely on the details of our data set , we compare fits with frequency in the source rest frame .",
    "we also study how the fits change with the significance of the included radio observations , with omitting radio observations with reported integration times , and with omitting more poorly determined red shifts .",
    "we also try to study source evolution effects with @xmath3 . as to the frequency dependence",
    ", differences do emerge if we include points at the observed frequency of @xmath130 ghz .",
    "this portion of the data set admits time delays in the grb rest frame of a month and more , and larger scale factors are required to yield fits of comparable quality .",
    "fitting data satisfying @xmath131 ghz , for which with a scale factor of 450 applied to the error in @xmath92 we find @xmath97 with @xmath132 day ghz@xmath94 mpc@xmath95 and @xmath133 day , or @xmath98 day ghz@xmath94 mpc@xmath95 at 95% cl .",
    "were we to fit all the data points we would require a scale factor of 685 to yield a fit of @xmath97 from which we would find @xmath134 day ghz@xmath94 mpc@xmath95 at 95% cl .",
    "we thus restrict our discussion henceforth to the portion of the data set which satisfies @xmath131 ghz .",
    "if we now restrict our fit to points in which the significance of the radio observation is @xmath135 or more , then our limit on the slope is still @xmath98 day ghz@xmath94 mpc@xmath95 at 95% cl , though we must increase the scale factor to 512 to recover a fit of comparable quality .",
    "some of the ra measurements have reported integration times and hence determinable uncertainties , whereas others do not .",
    "repeating the fits without the points with reported integration times yields no significant difference in the fit , though we must increase the scale factor to 467 to yield a fit of comparable quality .",
    "this may well follow as the dropped points do have larger errors and hence play a lesser role in the original fit .",
    "if we now return to our original data set and omit those points for which the determined redshift is a lower limit or merely `` likely , '' the limits do weaken .",
    "for example , with a scale factor of 419 , we find @xmath136 with @xmath137 day ghz@xmath94 mpc@xmath95 and @xmath138 , so that the limit on the slope at 95% cl is roughly a factor of 3 worse .",
    "this can be rationalized as these poorly known redshifts possess large @xmath3 .",
    "finally , to study the effects of cosmological evolution on the grbs , we repeat our fit with @xmath139 and find similar results .",
    "that is , for a scale factor of 539 we determine @xmath140 with @xmath141 day ghz@xmath94 mpc@xmath95 and @xmath142 , to yield @xmath143 day ghz@xmath94 mpc@xmath95 at 95% cl .",
    "thus the effects of cosmological evolution appear to be small .",

    "<S> this , with the advent of new opportunities to view gamma - ray bursts at cosmological distance scales , gives us a new probe of dark matter and a new possibility for its direct detection . </S>",
    "<S> as a first application we use the time delay determined from radio afterglow observations of distant gamma - ray bursts to realize a direct limit on the electric - charge - to - mass ratio of dark matter of @xmath0 at 95% cl .    </S>",
    "<S> some twenty - three percent of the universe s energy budget is in dark matter  @xcite , yet , despite its abundance , little is known of its properties . </S>",
    "<S> a number of methods have been proposed for the detection of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> such studies typically rely , for direct searches , on dark - matter  nucleus scattering , and , for indirect searches , on two - body annihilation of dark - matter to standard model ( sm ) particles ; constraints follow from the nonobservation of the aftermath of particular two - body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we probe dark matter in bulk to infer constraints on its particulate nature .    </S>",
    "<S> we search for dark matter by studying the modification of the properties of light upon passage through it . </S>",
    "<S> one can study either polarization  @xcite or propagation effects ; we focus here on the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting constraints are most stringent if dark matter consists of sufficiently low mass particles , be they , e.g. , warm thermal relics or axion - like particles , that its number density greatly exceeds that of ordinary matter . </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider dark _ </S>",
    "<S> matter_. matter effects are signaled by dispersive effects in the speed or attenuation of light . </S>",
    "<S> we study this by introducing an index of refraction @xmath1 , whose deviation from unity is controlled by the light  </S>",
    "<S> dark - matter scattering amplitude in the forward direction , i.e. , the forward compton amplitude , as well as by the angular frequency @xmath2 of the light and the redshift @xmath3 at which the matter is located . </S>",
    "<S> a dark - matter particle need not have an electric charge to scatter a photon ; it need only couple to virtual electromagnetically charged particles to which the photons can couple . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitude is related by crossing symmetry to the amplitude for dark - matter annihilation into two photons , so that any dark - matter model which gives rise to an indirect detection signal in the two - photon final - state  @xcite can also drive the index of refraction of light from unity . </S>",
    "<S> its real part is associated with the speed of propagation , and we search for its deviation from unity by searching for frequency - dependent time lags in the arrival of pulses from distant gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the limits on the non - observation of frequency - dependent effects in the speed of light are severe . </S>",
    "<S> the best limits from terrestrial experiments control the variation in the speed of light @xmath4 with frequency to @xmath5  @xcite , but the astrophysical limits are much stronger . </S>",
    "<S> the arrival time difference of pulses from the crab nebula bound @xmath6  @xcite , and still better limits come from the study of grbs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> grbs are bright , violent bursts of high - energy photons lasting on the order of thousandths to hundreds of seconds , and their brightness makes them visible at cosmological distances . </S>",
    "<S> time delays which are linear in the photon energy can occur _ in vacuo _ in theories of quantum gravity ; the special features of grbs make them particularly well - suited to searches for such signatures of lorentz violation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of photons of up to @xmath7 gev in energy from grb 090510 severely constrains this scenario , placing a lower limit on the energy scale at which such linear energy dependence occurs to @xmath8 gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although vacuum lorentz violation and light  dark - matter interactions can each induce dispersive effects , their differing red shift and frequency dependence render them distinct .    </S>",
    "<S> a model - independent analysis of the deviation of the refractive index from unity is possible if we assume that the photon energy is small compared to the energy threshold required to materialize the electromagnetically charged particles to which the dark matter can couple . in models of electroweak - symmetry breaking which address the hierarchy problem , a dark - matter candidate can emerge as a by - product . in such models </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic threshold @xmath9 is commensurate with the weak scale , or crudely with energies in excess of @xmath10 , as the new particles are produced in pairs . </S>",
    "<S> if the photon energy @xmath2 satisfies the condition @xmath11 , we can apply the techniques of low - energy physics to the analysis of the forward compton amplitude . under an assumption of lorentz invariance and other symmetries , we expand the forward compton amplitude in powers of @xmath2 and give a physical interpretation to the coefficients of the first few terms as @xmath12  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the term in @xmath13 is controlled by the dark matter particles charge and mass , weighted by preponderance , irrespective of all other considerations save our assumption of lorentz invariance  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between the index of refraction @xmath14 and the forward scattering amplitude @xmath15 for light of angular frequency @xmath2 is well - known  @xcite , where we relate @xmath15 to the matrix element @xmath16 of quantum field theory to connect to particle physics models of dark matter . using standard conventions  @xcite , we determine @xmath17 , in the matter rest frame  @xcite , so that @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the mass density of the scatterers and @xmath21 the particle mass . in our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the temperature of the dark matter at the red shift of the observed gamma - ray burst . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath23 should be a factor of some @xmath24 smaller than @xmath25 at the moment of its production or decoupling , our limits are not restricted to cold dark matter exclusively . moreover , even in the latter case , the candidate mass can be as light , e.g. , as light as @xmath26 ev in the axion model with bose - einstein condensation of ref .  @xcite . under the assumptions of causality or , </S>",
    "<S> more strictly , of lorentz invariance , as well as of charge - conjugation , parity , and time - reversal symmetry in the photon  dark - matter interaction , we have  @xcite @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the spin operator associated with the dark - matter particle and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the polarization vector associated with the photon in its initial ( final ) state . </S>",
    "<S> the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 are fixed in terms of the dark - matter electric charge and magnetic moment , respectively , as @xmath12  @xcite without further assumption  it does not even matter if the dark - matter particle is composite . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude @xmath33 is implicitly a @xmath34 matrix in the photon polarization , and its diagonal matrix elements describe dispersion in propagation and attenuation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 term describes changes in polarization with propagation , so that we need not consider it further . under analyticity and unitarity , expanding @xmath31 for @xmath11 yields a series in positive powers of @xmath35 for which the coefficient of every term of @xmath36 and higher is positive definite  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a term in @xmath14 which is linear in @xmath2 , discussed as a signature of lorentz violation  @xcite , does not appear if @xmath37 and the medium is unpolarized . we parametrize the forward compton amplitude as @xmath38 , where @xmath39  @xcite and the dark - matter millicharge is @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the terms in @xmath36 and higher are associated with the polarizabilities of the dark - matter candidate .    </S>",
    "<S> dispersive effects in light propagation are controlled by the group velocity @xmath41 , so that the light emitted from a source a distance @xmath42 away has an arrival time of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> for very distant sources we must also take the cosmological expansion into account  @xcite , so that as we look back to a light source at redshift @xmath3 , we note that the dark - matter density accrues a scale factor of @xmath44 , whereas the photon energy is blue shifted by a factor of @xmath45 relative to its present - day value @xmath46  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the light arrival time @xmath47 is @xmath48 with the hubble rate @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the cosmological parameters determined through the combined analysis of wmap five - year data in the @xmath50cdm model with distance measurements from type ia supernovae ( sn ) and with baryon acoustic oscillation information from the distribution of galaxies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the hubble constant today is @xmath51 , whereas the fraction of the energy density in matter relative to the critical density today is @xmath52 and the corresponding fraction of the energy density in the cosmological constant @xmath50 is @xmath53  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the time delay is characterized by powers of @xmath35 and unknown coefficients @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> different strategies must be employed to determine them . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath55 term incurs no frequency - dependent shift in the speed of light , so that to infer its presence one needs a distance measure independent of @xmath3 , much as in the manner one infers a nonzero cosmological constant from type ia supernovae data . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as @xmath56 it has the same phenomenological effect as a nonzero cosmological constant ; the longer arrival time leads to an inferred larger distance scale . </S>",
    "<S> cosmologically , though , its effect is very different as it scales with the dark - matter density ; it acts as grey dust . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining terms can be constrained by comparing arrival times for differing observed @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> the determination of @xmath57 and @xmath58 require the analysis of the grb light curves at extremely low and high energies , respectively , and probe disjoint dark - matter models . as a first application of our method </S>",
    "<S> , we use radio afterglow data to determine @xmath57 and thus to yield a direct limit on the electric - charge to mass of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity gives insight into the mechanism of dark matter stability . </S>",
    "<S> if dark matter possesses an internal symmetry , e.g. , it can not decay to lighter particles and conserve its hidden charge . </S>",
    "<S> such dynamics can also conspire to give dark matter a slight electric charge  @xcite , which , no matter how small , reveals the existence of its hidden interactions and the reason for its stability .    to determine @xmath57 we consider grbs with known redshift in which a radio afterglow is also detected . </S>",
    "<S> we collect the data and describe the criteria used in its selection in the supplementary material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time lag between the initial detection of the grb at some energy and the detection of the radio afterglow is @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> if we first observe the grb at kev energies and compare with the observed arrival time in radio frequencies , then the terms in positive powers of @xmath46 , as well as the term in @xmath60 , are negligible ; we let @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> in order to assess reliable limits on @xmath57 we must separate propagation effects from intrinsic source effects . </S>",
    "<S> statistically , we expect time delays intrinsic to the source to be independent of @xmath3 , and the time delay from propagation to depend on @xmath3 and @xmath2 in a definite way . </S>",
    "<S> such notions have been previously employed in searches for lorentz invariance violation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we separate propagation and emission effects , respectively , via @xmath62 where @xmath63 depends on the cosmological past through the hubble rate @xmath64 and @xmath65 allows for a frequency - dependent time lag for emission from the grb in the grb rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath66 , and @xmath67 contains the millicharge - to - mass ratio @xmath68 , i.e. , @xmath69 with @xmath70 gev/@xmath71  @xcite and @xmath72 the fine - structure constant . to provide a context , we first consider the value of @xmath73 which would result were we to attribute the time lag associated with the radio afterglow of one grb to a propagation effect . </S>",
    "<S> choosing the grb with the largest value of @xmath74 , we have a time lag of @xmath75 day associated with grb 980703a at @xmath76 measured at a frequency of 1.43 ghz . with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lag ] ) , setting @xmath77 , and noting that @xmath78 if the errors in its inputs are uncorrelated , the measured time lag fixes @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> since there are no known examples of a radio afterglow preceding a grb , this single time lag in itself represents a conservative limit . turning to our data sample of 53 grbs , we plot the measured time lag versus @xmath74 in fig . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ lag ] ) to determine @xmath67 and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we require @xmath81 as demanded by our model . </S>",
    "<S> fitting to the points with frequencies of @xmath82 ghz in the grb rest frame , we determine @xmath0 at 95% cl , which is comparable to our limit derived from a single observation of grb 980703a . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of our fit results on the selected frequency window , as well as the stability of our fits to the significance of the radio afterglow observation , to evolution effects in @xmath3 , and to the more poorly determined red shifts and radio afterglows is discussed in the supplementary information  @xcite .     determined from the observation of a grb and its radio afterglow plotted as a function of @xmath74 with @xmath83 , employing the data reported in the supplementary material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the points correspond to frequency windows of @xmath84 ghz ( @xmath85 , green ) , @xmath86 ghz ( @xmath87 , maroon ) , and @xmath88 ghz ( @xmath89 , blue ) in the grb rest frame . </S>",
