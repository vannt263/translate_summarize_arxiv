    "the classic derivation of the response of an interferometric detector makes a number of significant , unarticulated and generally unjustifiable assumptions regarding the background spacetime , the background spacetime coordinate system , and the perturbation coordinate gauge that significantly limit its applicability and render it unsuitable as an archetype for understanding or for calculation in more general circumstances . for the classic derivation to yield correct results    * the background spacetime metric must be expressible in a coordinate system with vanishing shift and where the ratio of spatial metric to squared lapse is coordinate - time independent ; * in this background coordinate system the beam splitter and end mirror world lines must be spatial coordinate stationary ( but not necessarily geodesic ) ; * the gravitational wave perturbation must be expressible in a gauge such that the perturbation to the beam splitter and end mirror world line coordinates are @xmath120 ; and * the spatial projection of the background spacetime null - geodesic followed by the electromagnetic wavefront between the beam splitter and the end mirror must be an extremum of the _ coordinate - time _ required to traverse the null ray [ cf .",

    "for example , consider isotropic cosmological spacetimes . in these spacetimes the gravitational wave perturbation may be expressed in a tt gauge with respect to an end mirror and beam splitter at rest with respect to the cosmological fluid .",

    "it is fortunate that , in this case , the unarticulated and apparently unrealized assumptions made in the classic derivations of the interferometer response cancel .",
