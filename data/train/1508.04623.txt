    "the discovery in 2012 of a new scalar particle at the lhc  @xcite , whose mass has been set to @xmath13 125.09 @xmath14 0.21 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath14 0.11 ( syst . ) gev  @xcite , lays on the table the challenging issue of whether it is actually the higgs boson from the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) or there is new physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) .    in this article",
    ", we focus on one of the new physics aspects of the discovered boson  the possibility of lepton flavor violating higgs decays ( lfvhd ) .",
    "in fact , very recently , the first direct search of the particular decay @xmath15 ( from now on , we will refer to both @xmath16 and @xmath17 decays in this shortened way ) has been performed by the cms collaboration  @xcite , and an upper limit on the branching ratio of br(@xmath15 ) @xmath18 at 95% c.l . has been set .",
    "additionally , cms has also observed a slight excess with a significance of 2.4 standard deviations at @xmath13 125 gev , whose best - fit branching ratio , if interpreted as a signal , is br(@xmath15 ) @xmath19 .",
    "the atlas collaboration has just released their results for the same @xmath15 decay  @xcite as well , focusing on hadronically decaying @xmath20 leptons .",
    "atlas has reported an upper limit of br(@xmath15 ) @xmath21 at 95% c.l . in agreement with the previous cms result .",
    "intriguingly , a small excess appears in one of the signal regions considered , even though it is not statistically significant .",
    "one way or another , the searches for lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) in the higgs sector have entered into the percent level .",
    "the statistical significance is not enough to reach a strong conclusion yet , but any evidence of lfv would unquestionably mean a clear bsm signal due to the huge suppression of lfv in the sm because of the absence of flavor - changing neutral currents .    in particular",
    ", the investigation of lfvhd is at present a very active field which is being studied in different models .",
    "lfvhd were considered for the first time in the context of the sm enlarged with three heavy majorana neutrinos in  @xcite and later in the context of the type i seesaw model in  @xcite , predicting tiny rates due to the strong suppression from the large heavy right - handed neutrino masses . by contrast , in the context of the inverse seesaw model ( iss )  @xcite with right - handed neutrino masses at the @xmath3 energy scale , much larger lfvhd rates , up to @xmath22 , can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "in addition , lfvhd have been also analyzed with special attention in the literature within the framework of supersymmetric ( susy ) models  @xcite , finding branching ratios slightly larger than in the iss case , up to @xmath23 .    here",
    "we will study the lfvhd within the context of the susy version of the iss , which we refer to here as the susy - iss model .",
    "in particular , we will present our estimate of the contribution to the br(@xmath17 ) from all the susy loops containing sneutrinos and sleptons which are typically different in the susy - iss with respect to other susy models , due to the important effects induced by the right - handed neutrinos and their susy partners with masses at @xmath3 .",
    "the potential increase of the lfvhd rates due to some of the new susy loops within the susy - iss model was first pointed out and estimated in  @xcite",
    ". other important enhancement due to susy loops have also been found in  @xcite for lfv lepton decay rates and other observables .",
    "some phenomenological implications at the lhc of susy - iss scenarios with large lfvhd rates within the same context as this work have been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition to performing a complete one - loop computation of the susy loops within the susy - iss model , one of our main goals here is to analyze in detail if the enhancement due to the sneutrinos and sleptons loops can be sufficiently large as to explain the lfvhd effect seen by cms and atlas .",
    "indeed , we will localize in this work some regions of the susy - iss parameter space where this is possible . in section  [ th - framework ]",
    "we describe the susy - iss model and introduce the parametrization we use to reproduce low - energy neutrino data . in section  [ sec : analytical ] we present the analytical results of our one loop calculation while we discuss our numerical predictions in section  [ results ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize the most relevant aspects for the present computation of the susy - iss model , which is a well - known extension of the mssm that can reproduce the observed neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "the mssm superfield content is supplemented by three pairs of gauge singlet chiral superfields @xmath24 and @xmath25 with opposite lepton numbers ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the susy - iss model is defined by the following superpotential : @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the generation indices have been suppressed and should be understood in a tensor notation as @xmath30 . in particular , all chiral superfields are left - handed , meaning that for @xmath31 the spin @xmath32 and spin @xmath33 components are , for example in the case of @xmath34 , @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , the down - type and up - type higgs bosons , defined as @xmath38    then the soft susy breaking lagrangian is given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] during this study we will take all soft susy breaking masses to be flavor diagonal , making sure that the only sources of flavor violation are in the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath41 , the lepton number conserving mass term @xmath42 and the lepton number violating mass term @xmath43",
    ". the only exception will be @xmath44 which receives rge - induced corrections coming from @xmath41 that , for phenomenological purposes , are given by  @xcite @xmath45 where we take @xmath46 for the rest of this work .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the neutrino mass matrix in the basis @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 where we have defined @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in order to agree with the definitions used in our previous article on lfv higgs decays  @xcite . in the limit @xmath53 , it is possible to diagonalize by blocks this matrix  @xcite , leading to the @xmath54 light neutrino mass matrix @xmath55 which , in turn , is diagonalized by the pmns matrix @xmath56@xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the diagonal matrix that contains the masses of the three lightest neutrinos .",
    "low - energy neutrino data can be reproduced by using the following parametrization introduced in @xcite : @xmath59    in particular , this parametrization allows us to use the neutrino yukawa couplings @xmath41 as input parameters . as we showed in  @xcite",
    ", the following three @xmath41 textures @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a scaling factor , can lead to large @xmath62 flavor transition rates while suppressing @xmath63 and @xmath64 flavor transition rates .",
    "we found that in the nonsupersymmetric iss model , these could lead to large branching ratios for lfv higgs decays , up to @xmath22 , while still agreeing with other experimental constraints .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , previous studies have demonstrated that supersymmetric contributions usually enhance the lfv rates . in particular , in the present susy - iss model ,",
    "since we consider a seesaw scale @xmath1 not far from the electroweak scale , this low value will enhance the flavor slepton mixing due to the rge - induced radiative effects by the large neutrino yukawa couplings , and this mixing will in turn generate via the slepton loops an enhancement in the lfvhd rates . on the other hand ,",
    "new relevant couplings appear , like @xmath65 , which for right - handed sneutrinos with @xmath66 masses may lead to new loop contributions to lfvhd that could even dominate  @xcite . in light of the recent cms and atlas searches  @xcite for @xmath15 ,",
    "this calls for a new and complete evaluation of the susy contributions to this observable in the susy - iss model .",
    "in this work , we perform a full one - loop diagrammatic computation of all relevant supersymmetric loops within the susy - iss model for @xmath67 , where @xmath68 here and from now on refers to the three neutral mssm higgs bosons , @xmath69 .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous estimate in  @xcite where an effective lagrangian description of the higgs mediated contributions to lfv processes was used , which was appropriate to capture the relevant contributions at large @xmath70 , and where the mass insertion approach was used to incorporate easily the flavor slepton mixing @xmath71 , working in the electroweak basis .",
    "however , an expansion up to the first order in the mass insertion approximation may not be appropriate for the type of scenarios studied here , due to the large flavor - nondiagonal matrix entries considered in this work . on the other hand , we are interested also in small and moderate @xmath70 values , not just in the large @xmath70 regime , and we also wish to explore more generic soft masses for the susy particles and scan over the relevant neutrino / sneutrino parameters , mainly @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath72 , not focusing only on scenarios with universal or partially universal soft parameters nor fixing the relevant parameters to one value as in  @xcite . thus , our calculation is performed instead in the mass basis for all the susy particles involved in the loops , i.e , the charged sleptons , sneutrinos , charginos , and neutralinos .    before moving to the calculation ,",
    "let us introduce the relevant interaction terms from the lagrangian for the study of the lfv higgs decays .",

    "we take into account the full set of 1-loop susy diagrams shown in figure  [ susy - diag ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , since we work in the mass basis , the set of diagrams contributing to lfv higgs decays ( four diagrams with charginos and sneutrinos in the loops , and four more with neutralinos and charged sleptons ) is the same as in the susy type i seesaw model which was considered in  @xcite .",
    "we keep their definition of the form factors @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the decay amplitude for @xmath76 with again @xmath69 and @xmath77 is the ingoing higgs boson momentum .",
    "the contributions of the susy diagrams are summed in @xmath78 and @xmath79 according to @xmath80 their analytic expressions are taken from  @xcite and reproduced in appendix  [ app_ff ] for completeness , including the proper modifications to adapt them to the susy - iss model .",
    "we have checked analytically the cancellation of divergences appearing in the loop contributions in both form factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 in eq.(16),giving , as expected , a finite result without the need of the renormalization procedure .",
    "notice that this cancellation is not trivial and is , therefore , a good test of our results of the form factors in appendix  [ app_ff ] .",
    "the parametrization of the lfvhd widths in terms of form factors remains unchanged and is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 coupling constant , @xmath84 is the mass of the higgs boson while @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the masses of final state leptons .",
    "in this section we show the numerical results of the lfv decay rates of the lightest neutral higgs boson , br(@xmath87 ) , as a function of the most relevant parameters of the susy - iss model for the full susy contribution to lfvhd , namely , @xmath1 , @xmath4 and @xmath72 .",
    "it should be noted that , in the absence of cp violation , as in our case , br(@xmath88)=br(@xmath89 ) and , therefore , in comparing with data the two rates should be added .",
    "we have imposed various experimental constraints , choosing as example two benchmark points leading to a higgs boson mass within 1@xmath90 of the central value of the latest cms and atlas combination , and with supersymmetric spectrum allowed by atlas and cms searches .",
    "indeed , we concentrate for this work on the slepton sector , since the squark sector is irrelevant for the lfvhd .",
    "the squark parameters are only relevant for the higgs mass prediction , thus one can always adjust the squark masses and the trilinear couplings @xmath91 and @xmath92 in order to ensure a correct higgs boson mass .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath93 , avoiding constraints from the invisible higgs decay widths , and consider only real @xmath94 and mass matrices , making constraints from lepton electric dipole moments irrelevant .",
    "finally , we also take into account the lfv radiative decays whose current upper limits at the @xmath95 c.l .",
    "are @xmath96 points excluded by lfv radiative decays will be denoted by a cross , while a triangle will represent the ones allowed .",
    "we present here the predictions of br(@xmath17 ) for the three neutrino yukawa textures exposed in the section  [ th - framework ] , ensuring the practically vanishing lfv in the @xmath63 sector , i.e. , leading to br@xmath97 and br@xmath98 .",
    "it should be noticed that these textures also suppress substantially the lfv in the @xmath99 sector .",
    "therefore , the most stringent constraint , making use of these textures , is that of the related lfv radiative decay @xmath100 .    in figure",
    "[ lfvhd - mr ] ,    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     where these parameters are varied independently from the susy scale .",
    "as when varying @xmath1 , increasing @xmath2 and @xmath101 makes the singlet sneutrinos heavier and decreases the size of the chargino contribution . for @xmath102 and @xmath103 which are dominated by this contribution , the br(@xmath17 )",
    "exhibits a strong decrease between 200 gev and 14 tev , by more than five orders of magnitude in the case of @xmath103 . for @xmath104",
    "a dip can be observed , due again to a cancellation between the chargino and neutralino contributions , with the latter dominating at large @xmath2 .",
    "for the first benchmark point , the largest @xmath17 rates allowed by the @xmath100 upper limit are obtained for @xmath103 with @xmath105 200 gev , with a maximum value of @xmath106 , just one order of magnitude below the present lhc sensitivity .",
    "if we move our attention to the vicinity of the region of low values of @xmath2 for the second benchmark point , we found large lfvhd rates , as displayed on the right panel of figure  [ lfvhd - msoft ] , with @xmath107 200 gev and @xmath108 2.5 tev .",
    "we observe a huge increase in br(@xmath17 ) for the three yukawa textures @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 , with maximum values of @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , respectively , due mainly to the low values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , all the parameter space for @xmath102 and @xmath103 cases is excluded by the @xmath100 upper limit . by contrast , most of the points for the @xmath104 texture are in agreement with this upper bound , because they are located in a region where the @xmath100 rates suffer a strong suppression as a consequence of the value set for @xmath4 in this case , @xmath108 2.5 tev .",
    "this fact allows us to obtain a maximum value of br(@xmath17 ) @xmath112 , completely within the reach of the current lhc experiments and large enough to explain the cms and atlas excesses if confirmed by other experiments and/or future data .",
    "in this article , we have presented the results of an updated and full one - loop calculation of the susy contributions to lepton flavor violating higgs decays in the susy - iss model .",
    "we found much larger contributions than in the type i seesaw due to the lower values of @xmath113 tev ) , an increased rge - induced slepton mixing , and the presence of right - handed sneutrinos at the tev scale , where both sleptons and sneutrinos large couplings transmit sizable lfv due to the large @xmath114 considered here .",
    "we showed that the branching ratio of @xmath87 exhibits different behaviors as a function of the seesaw and susy scale if it is dominated by chargino or neutralino loops .",
