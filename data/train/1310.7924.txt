    "helioseismic measurements of the deep solar interior are based on the inversions of the solar oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings inferred from observations of the velocity or intensity field on the visible part of the solar surface . with the exceptional quality and duration of the data now available from dedicated ground - based ( gong , bison ) and space projects ( soho mdi , golf , sdo hmi ) , it has become obvious that progress in improving the accuracy and resolution of helioseismic measurements is limited not by the solar noise and finite mode lifetimes , but by the current procedures for measuring the p - mode frequencies and frequency splittings from the observed power spectra . the most damaging aspect of current procedures is the systematic errors they introduce ; these are clearly seen both when comparing the results obtained with different data analysis pipelines @xcite and in the helioseismic inversions where they manifest themselves as internal inconsistencies in the input data sets @xcite .",
    "systematic errors can not be reduced by extending the duration of the observations and thus mask any gains in signal - to - noise ratio that come from the longer data set .",
    "one source of problem which limits the accuracy of the frequency measurements , is uncertainties in the spatial response function ( also known as the leakage matrix ) for the observations .",
    "the spatial response function depends on the area of the sun observed and on the details of the instrumentation .",
    "the latter can change with time and if the instrument is not accessible for comprehensive regular calibration ( one issue with soho mdi instrument is a gradual drift of the focal distance , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can be particularly damaging .",
    "fortunately , this problem can be mitigated by using an adaptive response function @xcite ( paper i ) .",
    "another source of problems , which we address here , is related to the modelling of the intrinsic line profiles .",
    "current ( published ) frequency measurements are based on fitting individual lines with lorentzian profiles .",
    "this is motivated by the analogy of solar oscillations with a simple damped single harmonic oscillator .",
    "however , many of the spectral peaks in the solar oscillation power spectrum are asymmetric .",
    "although this asymmetry has typically been accommodated by adding an extra asymmetry parameter ( e. g. @xcite ) to the lorentzian model , there are downsides to this approach : `` asymmetric lorenzian '' line profiles are only applicable in the immediate vicinity of a sharp resonance and the addition of the extra parameter can reduce the stability of the frequency measurements .    ideally , theoretical simulation of observational power spectra would incorporate physical modelling of wave excitation and damping . unfortunately , this approach is not feasible due to our poor knowledge of the turbulent convection and its interaction with waves in the outer solar layers .",
    "this lack of knowledge , however , does not mean that there is nt a way to provide a model suitable for helioseismic inversions that is based on some physically - motivated parameterizations .",
    "there is an analogy here with a similar difficulty which arises when the p - mode frequencies are used to study the solar internal structure .",
    "in this case we have poor knowledge of the structure of the near - surface layers and of the physics of the wave behavior there .",
    "however , because the wave propagation in these layers is very nearly vertical , it is reasonable to expect that the near - surface effects change slowly with frequency and depend on frequency only ( at least when the degree @xmath0 is not too high ) .",
    "apriory _ knowledge allows us to separate the uncertain effects into a frequency - dependent `` surface phase shift '' which as itself can be used later as a separate diagnostic of the near - surface layers . without implementing this knowledge , which allows us to split the inverse problem , we would not be able to infer anything about the solar interior from the solar oscillation frequencies ( more discussion on this topic can be found in @xcite ) .    in developing our spectral model",
    ", we will follow the very same logic and will split the problem in exactly the same manner",
    ". we will make no attempt to consider the physics behind the mode excitation and damping .",
    "instead , we will only assume that the two mechanisms operate close to the solar surface ( an assumption which is supported by the observations ) .",
    "for a spherically - symmetric sun , both the excitation strength and damping shall change slowly with frequency ( slow on a scale of frequency separation between modes of consecutive radial order ) , and shall depend on frequency only when the degree @xmath0 is not too high . at higher degree , just like in the `` surface phase shift '' , the dependence on @xmath0 at constant frequency is expected to emerge in proportion to @xmath1 , which governs the inclination of the acoustic ray paths to vertical in the leading order .",
    "this work on spectral modelling is a part of a wider project targeted at streamlining the helioseismic inversion process ( by analyzing the observational power spectra directly , without frequency measurements ) @xcite .",
    "however , it can also serve the more limited goal of improving the accuracy of frequency measurements . by allowing enough flexibility in the spectral model",
    "we will substantially reduce systematic errors .",
    "in addition , by reducing the total number of fitting parameters ( when this is allowed by the data ) we will improve the stability of the measurements and reduce random errors .",
    "obviously , eliminating systematic errors without introducing new ones is only possible if the model is physically relevant and the underlying basic assumptions are sound .",
    "there are three tests that can be used to verify this .",
    "the first is how well the model fits the observations .",
    "the second is whether the fitted parameters meet the original expectations for their behavior ( e.g. whether or not the excitation amplitude falls on a single function of frequency over a wide range in degree ) .",
    "the third and final test is helioseismic inversion which is sensitive to the internal consistency of the input data set ( the measured frequencies ) .",
    "we will develop our model in the temporal frequency domain .",
    "we assume the sun to be spherically symmetric ( deviations from spherical symmetry are usually treated as small perturbations ) , and expand all the variables in our model in terms of spherical harmonics .",
    "we also assume the wave excitation comes from uncorrelated excitation events localized somewhere near the solar surface and are random in both time and in the angular coordinates over the solar surface : this makes their contributions to the observational signal uncorrelated , a property which comes from orthogonality of spherical harmonics .",
    "this in turn allows us to reduce the excitation problem to one of considering the response of the dynamical system to a single excitation event .",
    "we start by considering a simplified ideal measurement in which the entire solar surface is observed so that a particular spherical - harmonic component in the signal can be perfectly isolated .",
    "we also consider the signal , defined over the solar surface , as a scalar field ( e.g. an intensity perturbation or radial velocity ) .",
    "complications arising from the line - of - sight projection of the vector velocity field that occurs in realistic measurements , which are limited by the visible part of the solar surface , will be addressed at the end of this section .    at this point",
    "it is convenient to first discuss the functional form of our spectral model , and the basic underlying assumptions , before we present a mathematical derivation .",
    "the general expression for the amplitude of a signal observed in a particular spherical harmonic is @xmath2 all the parameters in the right - hand side of this expression are slowly - varying functions of frequency .",
    "@xmath3 is the phase integral of the trapped acoustic wave , a monotonically increasing function of frequency which takes values @xmath4 at frequencies of acoustic resonances ( @xmath5 is the radial order ) .",
    "energy dissipation is assumed to be localized in the sub - surface layers and the effects of energy losses are parameterized by the surface acoustic reflectivity of absolute value @xmath6 . @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two complex excitation amplitudes .",
    "the complex variable @xmath9 designates the `` coherent component '' of the solar noise ( or the `` direct visibility '' of the excitation source ) which is thought to be responsible for the different sign of line asymmetries in intensity and velocity measurements @xcite .",
    "a random ( uncorrelated ) component of the solar noise will be added to the analysis later on ( equation [ e19 ] ) .",
    "we provide two derivations of equation ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the first derivation is based on the analysis of the linear adiabatic oscillation equations .",
    "we note that the excitation domain is not limited to the deeper layers , where the adiabatic approximation to the oscillation equations is thought to be valid , and can well extend to the near - surface layers where the physics of the oscillations is poorly understood .",
    "however , the general functional form of the equation ( [ e1 ] ) does not change when the excitation operates partly from the non - adiabatic domain ( as we will see from the second derivation which does not rely on the adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "separation of the variables in the oscillation equations is performed in a standard way with the displacement field @xmath10 and the eulerian pressure perturbation @xmath11 written as    @xmath12\\,e^{-i\\omega t}.   \\label{e2}\\ ] ]    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the angular part of the gradient operator and the hat symbol is used to designate unit vectors .",
    "the oscillation equations are implemented in the low - density envelope , where the cowling approximation ( which neglects perturbations of the gravitational field ) is locally applicable . in this approximation",

    "the internal solution , which satisfies the inner boundary conditions , is specified as a standing wave @xmath33 where @xmath3 is the phase integral across the acoustic cavity ; when the reflectivity @xmath6 is set to 1 , the two solutions match each other when @xmath34 ( eigensolutions of the adiabatic problem ) .    to address the wave excitation , we add dirac s @xmath35-function @xmath36 to the right - hand side of equation ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "a particular solution of the resulting inhomogeneous equation is the green s function @xmath37 , \\quad \\tau\\le\\tau_s   \\atop   0 , \\quad \\tau\\ge\\tau_s .",

    ", we obtain the amplitude of the external solution @xmath41 we see that the right - hand side of the equation ( [ e14 ] ) fits the functional form of the right - hand side of equation [ e1 ] .",
    "since an arbitrary excitation source can be considered as a linear superposition of `` elementary '' excitations described by @xmath35-functions , it will bring an observational signal of the functional form specified by equation ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "an alternative derivation comes from considering wave propagation and interference in the acoustic cavity in analogy with light propagation in a fabry - perot interferometer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consider two waves emitted by an excitation source which is localized near the surface : an upward wave and a downward wave .",
    "the upward wave is reflected almost immediately from the surface and then undergoes multiple further reflections from the surface as it travels up and down across the acoustic cavity .",
    "the signal observed at the surface is evaluated as a sum of a geometric series with the common ratio @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the phase lag between two consecutive reflections from the surface .",
    "this signal gives the term @xmath44 in equation ( [ e1 ] ) .",

    "we now designate @xmath56 and @xmath57 as the two components of the response function ( leakage matrix ) which specify the sensitivity of the spatial filter of the doppler - velocity measurements to the vertical and horizontal velocity components , respectively .",

    "our practical experience with fitting solar velocity power spectra provides no evidence that this ratio shall be modified , a conclusion that is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that a small variation of @xmath59 can not be distinguished from a small distortion of the leakage matrix caused by an error in the plate scale ( paper i ) .",
    "discussions of other efforts of measuring @xmath59 can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ e23 ] ) represents the spectral model which we use for matching the observed power spectra using an iterative maximum - likelihood technique . at each degree @xmath0 , the parameters @xmath62 are expected to change slowly with frequency ( we discard their possible variation with azimuthal order @xmath63 in the results presented below ) .",
    "@xmath64 is an effective excitation amplitude and @xmath6 is the acoustic reflectivity of the solar surface .",
    "these two parameters replace the mode amplitude and line width which are used in traditional spectral models for the oscillation modes .",
    "since the excitation and damping mechanisms are thought to operate in the near - surface layers , where wave propagation is nearly vertical , we expect @xmath64 and @xmath6 to depend on frequency only ( not on the degree ) , at least when the degree @xmath0 is not too high .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 specifies line asymmetry : its relation with `` asymmetric lorentzian '' line profiles is discussed in appendix a. @xmath66 is a composite background with contributions from both correlated and uncorrelated components of the solar noise .",
    "the functional form of equation ( [ e23 ] ) assumes that horizontal and vertical components of the background are in the same ratio as those of the resonant signal .",
    "this is hardly the case for solar granulation noise .",
    "the inaccuracy in this assumption leads to a distortion of the measured values of @xmath67 .",
    "we will get back to this point later when discussing our numerical results .    for a spherically - symmetric configuration ,",
    "the positions of the spectral resonances ( as well as the line profiles at given @xmath6 and @xmath65 ) , are governed by the phase integral @xmath68 which has to be specified in the spectral model for each value of degree @xmath0 .",

    "the oscillation frequencies and frequency - splitting coefficients are measured using an iterative procedure .",
    "our preliminary analysis ( with results presented in the next section ) was targeted at measuring the parameters @xmath62 for individual modes to check if they reveal the expected behavior ( a variation with frequency only , at least when the degree @xmath0 is not too high ) . for this reason ,",

    "separate tests where performed to verify that the fitted parameters do not suffer from systematic variations when the sizes of the fitting intervals change .",
    "the leakage matrix was computed as described in paper i with two extensions .",
    "one is a full description of the effects due to a non - zero solar b angle ( in paper i these effects were only allowed as a perturbation ) .",
    "this extension to the leakage - matrix computation is described in appendix b. the other extension is a more accurate treatment of the mode coupling by differential rotation , which is now performed as described in @xcite .",
    "spatial leaks in the range of @xmath85 in @xmath0 and @xmath63 where included in the spectral modeling .",
    "the large number of leaks had to be taken into account for addressing @xmath66 at frequencies higher than about 2 mhz , where the solar background appears to be buried below the resonant signals of spatial leaks .",
    "we note that the spectral model described by equation ( 23 ) is applicable not only to acoustic resonances , but also to the high - frequency interference pikes , or pseudo modes ( @xmath86 ) observed at frequencies higher than the `` acoustic cutoff '' frequency ( about 5 mhz ) .",
    "in addition , adaptation of the spectral model to observations in intensity just requires a modification of the response function ( @xmath87 in equation 23 ) .",
    "a representative example of the 1-year soho mdi power spectrum , obtained from the first year of observations ( at low solar activity ) , and its model is shown in fig . 1 . here",
    "the spectra corresponding to different values of azimuthal order @xmath63 have been shifted in frequency and then averaged for better visual comparison .",
    "the observed complexity of the asymmetric spectral lines is due to the contribution of multiple spectral leaks .",
    "we note the noise level is difficult to detect as it is below the amplitudes of resonant signals .",
    "the parameters of the spectral model are illustrated in figs 25 .",
    "the results are shown for @xmath88 modes of radial order @xmath5 from 1 to 10 and for the @xmath89 modes of degree @xmath90 .",
    "the maximum - likelihood solution was obtained by an iterative improvement of both the spectral parameters @xmath91 and the resonant frequencies and frequency splittings .",
    "the resulting agreement between the model and the data is satisfactory , as can be judged from a proper merit function @xcite and from the visual inspection of the @xmath63-averaged power spectra .",
    "however , a small systematic inaccuracy in the predicted amplitudes of the spatial leaks remains .",
    "the origin of this mismatch is not yet understood ; it may be related , in part , to the asymmetric distortion of the point - spread function of the mdi instrument .",
    "the spectral parameters of individual modes do not depend on the degree and collapse to slowly - varying functions of frequency only , when the degree @xmath0 is not too high ( less than about 100 ) . the composite background @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "5 ) may look to be an exception to this .",
    "however , an accurate measurement of the background at frequencies higher than about 2 mhz is a difficult task as the background level appears to be significantly smaller than the resonant signals coming from the spatial leaks . as a result",
    ", the measurement of @xmath67 can be distorted by small inaccuracies in the leakage matrix .",
    "the fitted background is also significantly higher than the average at the lowest values of degree @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath92 mode of @xmath93 in fig .",
    "a likely explanation of this excess is instrument - related noise due to variations in the exposure times for the series of observations acquired at different wavelengths by mdi and used to compute the solar velocity signal @xcite .",
    "this noise can probably be modeled by adding an @xmath94 component to the ( otherwise degree - independent ) solar background @xmath95 .",
    "interestingly , the analysis of solar @xmath89 modes reveal the same values of the excitation amplitudes @xmath64 and `` acoustic reflectivity '' @xmath6 as solar @xmath88 modes of similar frequencies ( figs 2 , 3 ) .",
    "this indicates that the excitation and damping mechanisms do not distinguish between @xmath88- and @xmath89 modes , despite the difference in their physical nature ( the @xmath89 modes are incompressible waves ) .",
    "the composite background of @xmath89 modes appears to be smaller than that of @xmath88 modes ( fig .",
    "5 ) . since the fitted background @xmath67 at low frequencies",
    "is dominated by the granulation noise , one possible explanation is that its contribution to the observational power shall be modeled with a smaller ( or zero ) value of @xmath59 , which specifies the ratio of horizontal and vertical velocities . when processing the data we used a simple theoretical value ( equation [ e24 ] ) which corresponds to incompressible adiabatic motion .",
    "this approximation is hardly relevant to granulation noise .",
    "6 shows the rotational splitting coefficients resulting from the measurement process described above , in comparison with published splitting coefficients @xcite .",
    "the horn - like structures in the published results , which signify systematic errors , are eliminated . as indicated by a detailed analysis @xcite ,",
    "the dominant part of the systematic errors came from discarding the effects of mode coupling by differential rotation in the original version of the soho mdi data analysis pipeline ( which was later improved to include these effects , among others ; see * ? ? ? * who also observed a reduction in the horn - like structures ) .",
    "the differences between the centroid frequencies and their published values are shown in fig .",
    "the major part of the discrepancies is due to the line asymmetries which were not accounted for in the original version of the mdi data analysis pipeline .",
    "smaller - scale features are due apparently to the combination of the mode - coupling effects with the plate - scale error .",
    "the centroid frequencies measured in this work have been used in a recent study targeted at the seismic diagnostics of the equation of state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was found that these frequencies allow us to achieve a significantly better agreement with solar models .",
    "this is quite an unusual finding : better accuracy of observational data brings better agreement with theoretical models .",
    "when tested with high - quality 1-year soho mdi doppler velocity measurements , the spectral model suggested in this paper allows an accurate description of the observational power spectra over a wide ( continuous ) range of frequency and in the degree range up to @xmath0 of about 200 .",
    "the oscillation frequencies and frequency splittings measured by the new technique appear to have smaller systematic errors when compared with published results .",
    "a distinctive feature of the technique is its potential ability to reduce the random errors in the frequency- and frequency - splitting measurements of the p modes which penetrate into the deep solar interior .",
    "this benefit comes from the global approximations of the spectral parameters of the model ( excitation amplitude @xmath64 , acoustic reflectivity @xmath6 , line asymmetry @xmath65 and composite background @xmath66 ) . at both low and intermediate degree @xmath0 these parameters can be represented by slowly - varying functions of frequency only ( a possible exception is the solar background @xmath66 , which requires further study ) . when inferred from the large volume of high - quality intermediate - degree data , these global approximations can be used in measurements at lower degree @xmath0 .",
    "the subsequent reduction in the number of free parameters in the mode - fitting algorithm is expected to bring significant improvement to the accuracy and precision of the frequency- and frequency - splitting measurements in this important region of the solar oscillation power spectrum ( which contains information on the solar core ) .",
    "a problem which is not yet resolved is that the performance of the technique degrades when analyzing the mdi data of degree higher than about 200 .",
    "this is apparently due to an inaccuracy in the predicted amplitudes of the spatial leaks .",
    "this leads to poor stability ( and unavoidable systematic errors ) of the frequencies and frequency splittings at higher degree where the spatial leaks start to blend into a single ridge .",
    "the origin of this problem may be related , at least in part , with the asymmetric distortion of the point - spread function of the mdi instrument ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is not accounted for in our model .",
    "our future work is targeted at processing the entire volume of the soho mdi data accumulated over the 15 years of the mdi operational lifetime , as well as implementation of our technique to the analysis of sdo hmi data . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the ultimate goal of the project is a streamlined helioseismic inversion . here",
    "frequency measurements will be eliminated from the analysis , and the parameters of the rotating and aspherical solar model will be matched directly with p - mode power spectra .",
    "this approach will bring the benefits of streamlined regularization by eliminating the problems associated with error correlation and possible mode misidentification in the frequency measurements .",

    "another approach to modeling observational signal over a continuous frequency range ( all the way between the consecutive acoustic resonances ) was suggested recently by @xcite .",
    "the expression suggested for the observational amplitude differs markedly from our equation ( a4 ) : instead of a single frequency - dependent function @xmath126 which defines the normalization of all the partial fractions @xmath127 ( equation a4 ) , each partial fraction enters the summation with individual complex amplitude .",

    ", the origin of the line asymmetry is very different : when @xmath128 , the asymmetry comes from the emission , by the same excitation event , of both an upward- and downward propagating waves ; the sign of the asymmetry and its strength are thus governed by the parity and depth of the excitation source ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",

    "the pair of consecutive excitations can be interpreted as being produced by the upward and the downward wave .",
    "it is seen from this example that line asymmetry is governed directly by the spatio - temporal properties of a single excitation event and does not require interference with modes of neighboring frequencies .",
    "interpretation of line asymmetry it terms of mode interference also faces difficulty when the frequency separation @xmath114 is much bigger than the linewidth , i.e. when the amplitude of a neighboring mode is negligibly small in the vicinity of a sharp resonance .",
