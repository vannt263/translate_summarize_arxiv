    "the standard model ( sm ) is a theory based on the gauge group @xmath1 that successfully explain most of the particle physics observations @xcite .",
    "however , there is a wide interest to study alternative extensions consistent with the current experimental energies , and that provide more fundamental answers to some theoretical questions that the sm does not explain in a satisfactory form .",
    "for example , the sm flavor puzzle is one of the longstanding problem , where regardless that all the fermions acquire masses at the same scale @xmath2 gev , experimentally they exhibit very different mass values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the quark sector .    in the sm ,",
    "the fermion masses are provided by yukawa interactions consistent with the gauge symmetry and with the inclusion of only one scalar doublet .",
    "taking into account that @xmath3 represents the usual left - handed quark doublet , @xmath4 and @xmath5 the right - handed up- and down - type singlets , and @xmath6 the three phenomenological families , the yukawa lagrangian for the quark sector reads :    @xmath7    where the scalar doublet @xmath8 acquire a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath9 gev .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , the above lagrangian leads to the mass matrices . since the original symmetry @xmath10 does not impose any restriction in the family indices ,",
    "there arise off - diagonal ( mixing ) terms in the yukawa couplings @xmath11 , leading to mass matrices of the form :    @xmath12    where the symbol @xmath13 indicates components proportional to the same scale @xmath14 and the yukawa components @xmath15 . however , the phenomenological masses range from mev ( @xmath16 mev ) to gev scales ( @xmath17 gev ) , where the heaviest quark ( top quark ) is about 5 order of magnitude larger than the lightest one ( up quark ) .",
    "this require `` unnatural '' fine tuning of the yukawa parameters without any apparent fundamental reason . on the other hand",
    ", many physicists believe that there must exist some sort of naturalness mechanisms that explain why some parameters have smaller values than others .",
    "for example , it is possible that small numbers are low energy manifestations of broken symmetries which become exact above some energy scale , where the small parameters are exactly cancelled .",
    "this idea has been implemented into the yukawa structure using non - universal @xmath0 symmetry ( the froggatt - nielsen mechanism ) @xcite , non - abelian symmetries @xcite , discrete symmetries @xcite , among other models @xcite . in this work",
    "we propose a new model where the combination of an extra @xmath0 symmetry and a @xmath18 global symmetry generate mass matrices of the form :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the sm breaking scale .",
    "the matrix @xmath21 exhibits vanishing determinant with one massless particle ( i.e , the symmetries suppress the up quark mass ) and two massive quarks at the electroweak scale gev ( for the charm and top quarks ) , while @xmath22 exhibits two massless particles ( the down and strange quarks ) and one massive quark also at the gev scale ( the bottom quark ) . in addition , the extra gauge symmetry implies a new neutral gauge boson ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , experimentally we do not see any massless quark and no such second weak neutral current has been detected , which suggests that _ i. ) _ the extra @xmath0 gauge symmetry must be spontaneously broken and _ ii . )",
    "_ the new breaking scale must be at a large scale @xmath24 in order to obtain a heavy @xmath23 boson above current experimental limits .",

    "our model includes additional terms in the yukawa lagrangian which lead to extended mass matrices compatible with the symmetries of the form :    @xmath25    where the symbols @xmath13 and @xmath26 indicate terms at the electroweak scale @xmath27 , and @xmath28 terms at the large scale @xmath29 .",
    "the above extended matrices have non - vanishing determinant , providing masses to all quarks .",
    "in particular , after diagonalization , the quarks up ( u ) , down ( d ) and strange ( s ) acquire masses at the scale @xmath30 mev as a result of the new mixing terms @xmath26 and the large scale @xmath28 , which is consistent with fig .",

    "finally , we find from ( [ ds - ratio ] ) that the large splitting between @xmath146 and @xmath147 is consequence of the existence of non - degenerated heavy massive quarks according to ( [ numeric2 ] ) .",

    "extensions with abelian non - universal @xmath0 symmetry are very well - motivated models which involves a wide number of theoretical aspects . in this work , by requiring non - universality in the left - handed quark sector , we proposed a new @xmath151 gauge model with yukawa interactions invariant under a global @xmath152 symmetry . with the addition of three exotic quark singlets , one scalar doublet and two scalar singlets , we obtained a free - anomaly theory which predict zero - texture mass matrices for the ordinary sm quarks with three massless quarks ( u , d , s ) , and three massive quarks ( c , b , t ) at the electroweak scale ( gev ) . the mixing between sm quarks and the new exotic quarks consistent with the symmetries and the cancelation of the chiral anomalies , provided masses to the lightest quarks ( u , d , s ) at the mev scales .",
    "predictable mass ratios were obtained with few free parameters , and hierarchical structures arose `` naturally '' without large tuning of the yukawa couplings .",
    "these hierarchies can be understood as follows :    * @xmath153 due to the non - universal @xmath31 gauge symmetry and a global @xmath70 symmetry , the yukawa interactions among ordinary matter lead to zero - texture mass matrices of the up- and down - type quarks . however , since an additional @xmath72 global symmetry is required only for the down sector , the mass structure between up- and down - type quarks is not equivalent : while in the up sector the c- and t - quarks acquire masses at the scale @xmath154 gev , in the down sector only the b - quark obtains mass at this scale through @xmath155 .",
    "thus , the three quarks ( u , d , s ) remain massless . on the other hand , to cancel the chiral anomalies , three exotic quarks @xmath156 ( and one neutrino singlet @xmath157 ) are introduced .",
    "the interactions between the massless and the exotic quarks , provide masses to the former .",
    "these masses are inverse in the heavy quark masses , obtaining a see saw - type mechanisms : @xmath158 [ gev@xmath159@xmath160 $ ] @xmath161 [ mev ] .",
    "* @xmath162 since the d- and s - quarks acquire mev scale masses through interactions with two non - degenerate heavy quarks @xmath163 , the ratio @xmath150 is not one according to ( [ ds - ratio ] ) . if @xmath164 then @xmath165 .",
    "* @xmath166 although both c- and t - quarks acquire masses at the scale of gev , they are non - degenerate due to the likeness between yukawa constants in the natural scheme . thus , a large ratio @xmath167 arises naturally if the top coupling @xmath121 is slightly different to the other up - type quark coupling @xmath120 . indeed ,",
    "if the flavor symmetry between families 2 and 3 is exact in the up sector ( @xmath168 ) , the charm quark becomes massless and only the top quark acquire mass .",
