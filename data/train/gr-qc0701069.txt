    "the problem of calculating the back - reaction force , or _ self force _ ( sf ) , experienced by a point particle as it moves in curved spacetime is now understood well enough to allow actual computations of this effect in systems comprising of a small object orbiting a large black hole .",
    "the fundamental formulation of the problem and its solution was set in works by dewitt and brehme @xcite ( electromagnetic sf ) , mino , sasaki and tanaka @xcite and quinn and wald @xcite ( gravitational sf ) , and quinn @xcite ( scalar field sf ) .",
    "an alternative formulation was introduced by detweiler and whiting @xcite , also clarifying the relation between the sf picture ( `` forced motion on a background geometry '' ) and the standard description based on the principle of equivalence ( `` geodesic motion in a perturbed geometry '' ) .",
    "a number of authors later devised a practical calculation method for the sf in black hole spacetimes  the `` mode sum scheme''which is based on multipole decomposition of the retarded field , and relies on standard methods of black hole perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "this method has since been implemented by various authors on a case - by case basis , so far mostly for calculations of the _ scalar field _ sf .",
    "work so far included the cases of a static particle in schwarzschild @xcite or along the rotation axis of a kerr black hole @xcite ; radial plunge trajectories @xcite and circular orbits around a schwarzschild black hole @xcite ; and ongoing work on eccentric orbits in schwarzschild @xcite .",
    "the _ gravitational _ sf has been calculated so far only for radial trajectories in schwarzschild @xcite and for static ( non - geodesic ) particles in schwarzschild @xcite .",
    "the case of an orbiting particle has been tackled only under the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of the subject , including a self - contained account of sf fundamentals , is provided by poisson @xcite . for a snapshot of the current activity in the field",
    ", the reader may refer to @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations for the work on self forces draws from the need to devise accurate theoretical waveforms for the gravitational radiation from extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( emris)of the prime targets for lisa , the planned space - based gravitational wave detector @xcite .",
    "this requires solving the sf problem in the _ gravitational _ case , for generic inspiral orbits around a kerr black hole .",
    "the main challenge in extending the analysis from the scalar - field toy model to the gravitational case has to do with the gauge freedom in the latter case .",
    "the problem can be summarized as follows .",
    "the gravitational perturbation in the vicinity of the point particle is best described using the _ lorenz _ gauge ( see appendix [ appa ] ) , which preserves the local isotropic nature of the point singularity . on the other hand , the field equations that govern the global evolution of the metric perturbation are more tractable in gauges which comply well with the global symmetry of the black hole background  best known examples of which are the `` radiation '' gauges @xcite or the regge - wheeler gauge @xcite .",
    "now , in calculating the local sf we need , essentially , to subtract a suitable local , divergent piece of the perturbation from the full ( retarded ) perturbation field . in doing so",
    ", both fields ( local and global ) must be given in the same gauge ; the `` gauge problem '' arises since the two fields are normally calculated in different gauges . indeed ,",
    "the only fully - worked - out example of the gravitational sf so far is the case of radial orbits in schwarzschild @xcite , where the gauge problem is avoided simply because , in this particular setup , the singular piece of the regge - wheeler perturbation happens to coincide with that of the lorenz - gauge perturbation .",
    "one approach to the problem has been to try and calculate the local divergent piece in one of the `` global '' gauges  specifically the regge wheeler gauge in the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "this has been implemented so far only within a post - newtonian approximation @xcite . in the current work",
    "we take a complementary approach : we solve the perturbation equations , and obtain the `` global '' retarded field , directly in the lorenz gauge .",
    "the calculation is therefore done entirely within the lorenz gauge , the `` subtraction '' procedure necessary for constructing the sf is implemented in a straightforward way , and the gauge problem is avoided altogether .",
    "other advantages of working in the lorenz gauge include the fact that the field equations then take a fully hyperbolic form ( making them especially suitable for time - domain integration ) ; and the fact that the lorenz - gauge metric perturbation is better behaved near the particle compared with the perturbation in other gauges @xcite ( which , again , makes it more suitable for numerical implementation ) .",
    "the better regularity of the lorenz - gauge perturbation is manifested in the behavior of individual multipole modes of the field : it is well known , for example , that the multipole modes of the regge ",
    "wheeler perturbation from a point particle in schwarzschild generally show a discontinuity across the particle .",
    "in contrast , the modes of the lorenz - gauge perturbation are always continuous at the particle .",
    "our `` all - lorenz - gauge '' approach is made possible ( at least is the schwarzschild case ) following a recent work by barack and lousto @xcite ( hereafter bl ) , which provided a practical formulation of the lorenz - gauge perturbation equations in the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "our calculation is based on the bl formulation , and our numerical code incorporates the code developed in bl ( with a few improvements ) . in the current work we focus on circular geodesic orbits , for simplicity .",
    "however , since our treatment is based on a time - domain evolution , our code could be amended to deal with generic orbits ( in schwarzschild ) in an almost straightforward manner .",
    "we shall discuss this extension of the analysis in the concluding section , and also comment there on the important extension to the kerr case .",
    "our calculation of the sf proceeds as follows .",
    "we first write down the 10 ( coupled ) evolution equations for the 10 tensorial - harmonic components of the lorenz - gauge metric perturbation , in the form given in bl ( with a slight modification ) .",
    "the energy - momentum of the orbiting particle is represented by a suitable delta - function distribution , whose tensor - harmonic components serve as sources for the evolution equations . for given orbital radius and given multipole numbers @xmath2 and @xmath3 we solve the equations numerically through time - domain evolution in 1 + 1 dimensions ( time+radius ) , using a 2nd - order - convergent finite - difference scheme on a staggered grid based on characteristic coordinates .",
    "we integrate long enough to allow any spurious initial radiation to dissipate efficiently ( this takes @xmath4 orbital periods for strong - field orbits ) .",
    "we then record the values of the metric perturbation and it temporal and radial derivatives at the location of the particle .",
    "[ recall that individual multipole modes of the perturbation are continuous at the particle .",
    "their first derivatives have a finite jump discontinuity across the particle ( in the radial direction ) and so we record both values of the derivatives . ]",
    "we repeat this calculation for all multipole modes with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is determined experimentally so that our standard of accuracy ( of @xmath7 fractional error in the final sf ) is met . in practice",
    "we found it sufficient to take @xmath8 for the radial component and @xmath9@xmath10 for the @xmath11 component ( depending on the orbital radius ) .",
    "the modes @xmath12 are calculated separately , using the method of detweiler and poisson @xcite .",
    "the values of the metric perturbation and its derivatives at the particle are then used as input for the mode - sum scheme . within this scheme ,",
    "each of the modes is `` regularized '' using functions known analytically @xcite , and the sum over modes yields the desired sf .",
    "our main results are summarized in tables [ table : compare - edot ] and [ table : result - fr ] ( along with fig .",
    "[ fig : r0vsfr ] ) .",
    "the tables display the values of both radial and temporal components of the sf as a function of the orbital radius .",
    "the temporal component of the sf is simply related , in our stationary circular - orbit setup , to the rate of change of the orbital energy parameter , and hence to the flux of energy carried in gravitational waves to null infinity and down the event horizon .",
    "our results demonstrate this energy balance , which provides a reassuring validity test for our code .",
    "the radial component of the sf ( which is itself gauge dependent ) describes the conservative back - reaction effect on the orbital parameters . based on our results",
    "we calculate the conservative shift in the energy and angular momentum of the circular geodesic , as well as the shift in the orbital frequency  the latter being gauge invariant .",
    "our results for the shifts are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : elvsr0 ] and [ fig : r0vsomg2 ] . to check the validity and robustness of our code , and assess the accuracy of our results , we performed the following tests .",
    "( i ) _ numerical convergence : _ for each of the modes calculated , we repeated our computation with a handful of different numerical resolutions , checking that the answer converges quadratically to a limiting value with decreasing step size . to determine the limiting value we used a richardson extrapolation ( over step size ) , and recorded the estimated error from this extrapolation .",
    "( ii ) _ effect of spurious initial waves : _ we compared the values of the sf at two different ( late ) evolution times ( recall that in our stationary setup the physical sf does not depend on time ) , in order to asses the effect of residual spurious waves .",
    "( iii ) _ large @xmath2 behavior : _ the behavior of the sf modes at large multipole numbers @xmath2 is known analytically with high precision [ see eqs.([modesum])([b ] ) below ] .",
    "we verified that our numerically calculated modes have the right behavior at large @xmath2 , through all three known leading terms in the @xmath13 expansion .",
    "this agreement is necessary , in fact , for a successful implementation of the mode - sum scheme .",
    "( iv ) _ error from large-@xmath2 tail : _ the mode - sum scheme involves summation over all modes @xmath2 . in practice",
    "we computed all modes up to @xmath14 , and used an extrapolation to estimate the contribution from the remaining @xmath15 tail .",
    "we assessed and recorded the error from this extrapolation .",
    "( v ) _ comparison of one - sided forces : _ the mode sum scheme can be implemented in two essentially independent ways , by using either the `` external '' or the `` internal '' values of the sf modes ( i.e. , values calculated by taking one - sided derivatives of the metric perturbation from outside or inside the orbit , respectively ) .",
    "of course , the final value of the sf should not depend on our choice .",
    "we used our code to work out both values , and checked that they are the same to a very good accuracy .",
    "we recorded the ( tiny ) difference between the two values .",
    "our total computation error was taken to be the combined error from the extrapolation over step size [ item ( i ) above ] , the deviation from stationarity [ item ( ii ) above ] , the extrapolation over @xmath2 [ item ( iv ) ] , and the small discrepancy between external and internal values .",
    "we made sure that this combined error is kept under 0.1% .",
    "( vi ) _ comparison with energy flux : _ we checked that the computed temporal component of the sf balances the flux of energy to null infinity and down the horizon .",
    "we found an excellent agreement .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we review the formalism for constructing the metric perturbation in the lorenz gauge and for calculating the sf via the mode sum scheme ( focusing on the case of circular orbits in schwarzschild ) .",

    "sec : summary ] we discuss the extension of this work to more general orbits in schwarzschild , and to orbits in kerr .",
    "throughout this work we use standard geometrized units ( with @xmath16 ) and metric signature @xmath17 .",
    "the riemann tensor is defined as in ref .",
    "consider a pointlike particle of mass @xmath0 , in a circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath18 .",
    "let the worldline of the particle be represented by @xmath19 , with tangent four velocity @xmath20 .",
    "at the limit @xmath21 ( i.e. , neglecting sf effects ) the particle traces a geodesic @xmath22 , with associated four velocity @xmath23 . without limiting the generality ,",
    "we adopt a schwarzschild coordinate system @xmath24 in which the orbit is confined to the equatorial plane",
    ". then @xmath25.\\ ] ] this circular geodesic can be parametrized by the radius @xmath26 , or , alternatively , by the angular velocity ( with respect to time @xmath11 ) @xmath27 by the specific energy parameter , @xmath28 or by the specific angular momentum parameter , @xmath29 the subscripts ` 0 ' here indicate that the above are values associated with the geodesic @xmath30 ( below we will consider the correction to these values due the sf effect ) . as always in our perturbative treatment , tensorial indices are `` raised '' and `` lowered '' using the background metric .",
    "now assume that @xmath0 is finite ( but still very small compared to @xmath31 ) .",
    "the equation of motion can be written as @xmath32 where the covariant derivatives are taken with respect to the _ background _ ( schwarzschild )",
    "geometry , and @xmath33 $ ] is the gravitational sf .",
    "clearly , the symmetry of the problem implies @xmath34 . also , assuming the four - velocity is kept normalized along the worldline , i.e. , @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 , leading to @xmath37 , and the four components of the sf are not independent . in the circular orbit case",
    "we have the relation @xmath38 , which we may write , through leading order in @xmath0 , as @xmath39 hence , we need only calculate two of the components of the sf : the @xmath40 component and ( say ) the @xmath11 component . for simplicity we shall refer to these as the `` radial '' and `` temporal '' components .",
    "our goal would be to calculate both components , as a function of the orbital radius @xmath26 .",
    "note that it is sufficient , for the sake of obtaining the leading - order @xmath41 $ ] sf , to assume that the motion is momentarily geodesic .",
    "the sf affects the motion of the particle in two ways : firstly , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are no longer conserved over time , so we can speak of the `` rate of change '' of the energy and angular momentum of the orbit .",
    "secondly , at each given time , the values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are shifted with respect to their corresponding geodesic values @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the case of a circular orbit , the first ,",

    "the @xmath11 and @xmath51 components of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) immediately give @xmath52 respectively , describing the dissipative effect of the sf .",
    "the change of energy and angular momentum is precisely balanced by the flux of energy and angular momentum carried away by gravitational waves .",
    "for the conservative effect , consider the @xmath40 component of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) , along with the normalization condition @xmath35 . solving these two equations simultaneously for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( recalling @xmath55 )",

    "we now assume that the original gauge is `` physically reasonable '' . in our case",
    "( a circular equatorial orbit in schwarzschild ) , this would mean that the perturbation @xmath67 in that gauge reflects the stationarity of the problem , and also retains the symmetry of reflection through the equatorial plane .",
    "the lorenz gauge ( see appendix [ appa ] for definition ) is an example of such a gauge . restricting our discussion to gauge transformations within the family of `` physically reasonable '' gauges , we should clearly require , in our case , @xmath68 , as well as @xmath69 . from eq .",
    "( [ deltaf ] ) we then get @xmath70 , along with @xmath71 hence , `` physically reasonable '' gauge transformations may affect the radial component of the sf ( they do so if they have @xmath72 ) , but not the other components .",
