    "the classification of non - classical correlations and their effects still remains an open problem @xcite .",
    "quantum discord is a measurement for the `` quantumness '' of a pairwise correlation @xcite .",

    "it is notable that in such a topologically ordered system , quantum discord of local spins is always zero in both phases , which means the local correlations are totally classical . while the correlation between a local spin and the rest of the lattice behaves more like a pairwise entangled pure state , and the quantum discord signals critical point .",

    "it was pointed out that in topologically ordered systems , which have no local order parameter , the topological quantum phase transition can be signaled by local properties like the reduced fidelity of two spins , and it is even more sensitive than the global fidelity @xcite . here",

    "ii , the quantum discord of @xmath70 is zero .",
    "that means the correlations between any two local spins are always classical .",
    "this is quite different from other studies of quantum discord in the phase transition of 1d systems that are not topologically ordered @xcite , where the quantum discord of local spins shows different behavior in different phase areas and exhibits critical behavior .",

    "the system is conserved under the transformation of @xmath74 along any closed loop , which eliminates all non - diagonal terms .",
    "so the quantum discord is zero in the topological phase area .",
    "it was stated in ref .",
    "@xcite that in a topologically ordered system , all observable properties should be invarint under smooth deformations ( diffeomorphisms ) of the space - time manifold , which means the only local operator that has nonvanishing correlation functions is the identity .",

    "while the other phase area where @xmath48 is a fully magnetized phase , which obviously only contains classical information of probability .",
    "this is why local correlations are classical in both phases .    besides",
    ", it was stated that topological quantum phase transition can not be described by the symmetry - breaking of a local order parameter and involves a global rearrangement of non - local correlations @xcite .",
    "however , recent researches indicated that some concepts in quantum information theory , which describe local properties although , still signal the singularity in topological quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the reduced fidelity and local magnetization were studied in the castelnovo - chamon model and the kitaev toric code in a magnetic field and they exhibit critical behavior of the topological quantum phase transition .",
    "we calculate the mutual information @xmath80 of two nearest spins , which is also a local property ( fig .",
    "the correlations in @xmath70 can be evaluated with the help of the mapping to ising model , as mentioned in sec .",
    "we can see that the mutual information of both nearest and next - nearest spins ( in the dual lattice ) exhibits critical behavior .",
    "but the next - nearest mutual information is much less sensitive .",
    "as we have seen in the last part , the correlations between local spins are completely classical in both phases . in this part",
    ", we calculate the correlation between a local spin and the rest of the whole lattice . as the increasing of @xmath30 , the system turns to the magnetic phase , and",
    "the correlation between a local spin and the lattice becomes more and more `` classical '' .    to calculate the correlation of an arbitrary spin denoted by @xmath81 with the lattice",
    ", we treat the rest of the lattice as a whole system .",
    "we can always rewrite the ground state as@xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the @xmath85 in the basis vectors are the binary number representation of @xmath42 excluding the @xmath81th spin , as mentioned in sec .",
    "notice that @xmath42 and @xmath86 have at least four different spins .",
    "so we are sure that @xmath87 and @xmath88 have no term in common , and @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , we can treat @xmath90 as a simple @xmath91 entangled state . in this case , the quantum discord is equal to the entanglement of entropy @xcite,@xmath92    we calculate it in detail .",
    "the coefficients @xmath93 are superposition coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq - gs ] ) correspoindingly .",
    "so the value of @xmath94 is just the ising partition function with a constraint that @xmath95 , in another word , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the nearest vertices of spin @xmath81.@xmath99/z(\\beta),\\nonumber \\\\ b^{2 } & = & \\sum_{\\{\\theta_{s}\\},\\theta_{r}\\theta_{r'}=-1}\\exp\\left[\\beta\\sum_{\\langle\\theta_{s}\\theta_{s'}\\rangle}\\theta_{s}\\theta_{s'}\\right]/z(\\beta).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that @xmath100 is just the nearest correlation function @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102/z(\\beta)\\nonumber \\\\   & = & a^{2}-b^{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] together with @xmath103 , we can get the value of @xmath104 .",

    ", we implement all possible local unitary operations on the spin and then measure it by @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106    where @xmath107    the unnormalized post - measurement density matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 both have only one non - zero eigenvalue respectively , i.e. , @xmath110/2 $ ] , where @xmath111 .",
    "that means the conditional information about the lattice after the measurement of a local spin is zero , and @xmath112 is always equal to the entanglement of entropy @xmath113 , no matter what measurement we impose on the local spin .",
    "so the quantum discord is equal to @xmath113,@xmath114 where@xmath115    the quantum discord and mutual information of the global correlation is shown in fig .",
    "3 . comparing with that of local spins correlation , the quantum discord is not zero , which means the quantum correlation exists in the lattice globally .",
    "it also signals the critical point in the phase transition , just like the mutual information . as the increase of @xmath30 , the quantum discord decreases to zero , which means the global quantum correlation disappears gradually .    in summary ,",
    "the quantum correlation hides in the global lattice",
    ". we can only get classical correlations between local spins .",
    "all these results of correlations seem to suggest that the ground state of the topologically ordered system behaves like a generalized ghz state .",

    "both local and global correlations were studied .",
    "the correlations were measured by quantum discord .",
    "as we have seen , local spins are classically correlated although the hamiltonian is so complicated . while the quantum correlation is hidden in the lattice globally .",

    "we analyzed that these distinctive characters result from the high symmetry of the 2d topologically ordered system .",
    "the spins along any loop on the torus are @xmath1-symmetric .",
    "this strict constraint clears the quantum correlations between local spins .",
    "only global quantum correlation exists , just like a generalized ghz state .",
    "we believe that this is a generic property in topological quantum phase transition because of the particular symmetry of topologically order systems , as mentioned previously .",
    "moreover , we calculate the mutual information of two nearest spins , which signals critical behavior of the topological quantum phase transition .",
    "similar to previous study of fidelity , mutual information also works as a local probe of the topologically ordered phase , although topological order can not be described by the symmetry - breaking of local order parameter .",
    "more study is required for the correlations in other more realistic systems ."
