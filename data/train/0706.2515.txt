    "the study of the intersections of stable and unstable manifolds of maps and flows has a strong influence on dynamical systems .",
    "in particular , the existence of a transverse intersection is associated with the onset of chaos , and gave rise to the famous horseshoe construction of smale .",
    "the poincar - melnikov method  @xcite is a widely used technique for detecting such intersections .",
    "given a system with a pair of saddles and a degenerate heteroclinic or saddle connection between them , the classical melnikov function computes the rate at which the distance between the manifolds changes with a perturbation .",
    "there have been many formulations of the melnikov method for two - dimensional maps or flows  @xcite and for higher - dimensional symplectic mappings  @xcite .",
    "recently , the geometric content of melnikov s method was exploited in order to detect heteroclinic intersections of lagrangian manifolds for the case of perturbed hamiltonian flows  @xcite .",
    "here it was shown that the heteroclinic orbits are in correspondence with the zeros of a geometric object , the so - called melnikov one - form .    for maps ,",
    "the melnikov function is an infinite sum whose domain is a saddle connection between two hyperbolic invariant sets . as usual , a simple zero of this function corresponds to a transverse intersection of stable and unstable manifolds of a perturbation of the original map .",
    "melnikov s method can also be used to compute transport fluxes . in particular , a _ resonance zone _ for a two - dimensional mapping is a region bounded by alternating segments of stable and unstable manifolds that are joined at primary intersection points  @xcite . because the intersection points are primary , a resonance zone is bounded by a jordan curve and has exit and entry sets  @xcite .",
    "the images of these sets completely define the transport properties of the resonance zone .",
    "moreover , the integral of the melnikov function between two neighbouring primary intersection points is the first order approximation to the geometric flux escaping from the resonance zone  @xcite .",
    "the method has also been applied to the case of periodically time - dependent , volume - preserving flows  @xcite and more generally to volume - preserving maps with fixed points  @xcite and invariant circles  @xcite .",
    "volume - preserving maps provide perhaps the simplest , natural generalization of the class of area - preserving maps to higher dimensions .",
    "moreover , they naturally arise in applications as the time - one poincar map of incompressible flows  even when the vector field of the flow is nonautonomous .",
    "thus the study of the dynamics of volume - preserving maps has application both to fluids and magnetic fields .",
    "our goal in this paper is to develop , based on the theory of deformations , a general , geometrical description of the melnikov displacement and to compare our theory to classical results .",
    "deformation theory was first introduced in the theory of singularities  @xcite , but was soon used in the contexts of volume and symplectic geometry .",
    "its application to dynamical systems in  @xcite provide results that are close to our goals .",
    "let @xmath0 be a smooth family of diffeomorphisms such that the unperturbed map @xmath1 has a saddle connection @xmath2 between a pair of compact @xmath3-normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds .",
    "let @xmath4 be the algebraic normal bundle of the saddle connection .",
    "we show that there exists a canonical @xmath5 section @xmath6 , called the _ melnikov displacement _ , that measures the splitting of the saddle connection in first - order .",
    "we will prove that the melnikov displacement is given by the absolutely convergent series @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vector field defined by @xmath9 .",
    "these sums do not converge in the tangent space @xmath10 , but only in the algebraic normal bundle @xmath11 .",
    "the use of the algebraic normal bundle in the study of normally hyperbolic manifolds goes back to  @xcite .",
    "the fact that ( [ mainformula ] ) always converges also addresses the question of how to deal with melnikov s method when the original pair of compact @xmath3-normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds ( that are connected with the saddle connection ) are not fixed with the perturbation .",
    "in addition , we will also show that the melnikov displacement has a number of geometric properties .",
    "the main result in this direction is that any change of coordinates acts on the displacement by its pullback .",
    "this result will be used to obtain the natural action of any symmetries , reversing symmetries or integrals of the dynamical system on the displacement .",
    "similarly , if the map preserves a symplectic or volume form , this gives additional structure to the displacement .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 is a family of exact symplectic maps and the normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds are fixed points , then we will show that there exists a function @xmath12 , the _ melnikov potential _ , such that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the symplectic two - form .",
    "this relation is reminiscent of the definition of globally hamiltonian vector fields .",
    "when the normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds are not fixed points ( or isolated periodic points ) , its stable and unstable manifolds are coisotropic , but not isotropic , and so the relation @xmath13 makes no sense .",

    "an immediate consequence of the definition is that all the forward and backward iterations of a fundamental domain are also fundamental .",
    "it is easy to see that proper boundaries always exist , and in fact , the unstable manifold can be decomposed as the disjoint union of fundamental domains : @xmath558    the importance of fundamental domains is that much of the information about the entire manifold can be found by looking only at these submanifolds .",

    "we have studied a general theory of the melnikov method that can be applied to many different settings . the formula   for the melnikov displacement @xmath70 generalizes many of the classical methods that use a normal vector field to measure the displacement with respect to a natural direction .",
    "for example , when the saddle connection is defined as the level set of a first integral @xmath364 , the classical poincar function @xmath573 measures the splitting as the rate of change of the first integral .",
    "if there is a riemannian structure and an associated adapted normal vector field @xmath377 , then the classical melnikov function @xmath574 measures the rate of change of the splitting in this normal direction . for the case of exact symplectic maps with saddle connections between hyperbolic fixed points ,",
    "the melnikov potential @xmath451 is defined on a lagrangian submanifold and acts as a generator for the displacement : @xmath575 .",
    "this melnikov theory can be extended to other situations and can be applied in many problems .",
    "for instance , one can study billiard dynamics inside a perturbed ellipsoid , following a program initiated in  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the billiard map inside an ellipsoid is an exact symplectic diffeomorphism defined on the cotangent bundle of the ellipsoid , which has a two - dimensional normally hyperbolic invariant manifold with a three - dimensional saddle connection .",
    "therefore , ellipsoidal billiards represent a strong motivation for a more detailed study of general normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds in a symplectic framework .",
    "this is a work in progress .    in discrete volume geometry",
    "there are many open melnikov problems , since the application of melnikov methods to volume - preserving maps began just a few years ago  @xcite .",
