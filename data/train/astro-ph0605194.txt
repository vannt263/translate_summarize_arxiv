    "one of unsolved issues in the planetary system formation is how kilometer - sized planetesimals form .",
    "there are two controversial models of the planetesimal formation : one is the growth through mutual sticking of dust aggregates due to nongravitational forces ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and another is the fragmentation of the dust layer due to the gravitational instability ( gi ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    micron - sized dust particles in a protoplanetary disk grow due to the thermal motion in the initial stage of the dust evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . unless the protoplanetary disk is globally turbulent , dust aggregates sweep up dust particles during the settling toward the midplane and the radial drift toward the central star , and grow to centimeter - sized aggregates ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . when the dust density , which is defined as the total mass of the dust per unit volume of the disk , at the midplane exceeds a few tenth of the gas density , a velocity shear in the vertical direction grows .",
    "the shear - induced instability will occur due to the velocity shear and prevents dust settling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the dust density at the midplane is difficult to approach the critical density of the gi , which is several hundreds of the gas density .",
    "a few possibilities to exceed the critical density of the gi have been considered : ( 1 ) if dust aggregates grow to the radii of the order of 10 @xmath0 , the coupling of the dust and gas becomes weak and the dust density at the midplane exceeds the critical density of the gi ( cuzzi et al . 1993 ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite has noted that the gi would be prevented by radial random velocities of the dust .",
    "( 2 ) if the dust - to - gas surface density ratio increases by an order of magnitude through the dust migration or gas dissipation , the shear - induced instability is suppressed ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( 3 ) if the pressure has a local maximum value in a protoplanetary disk , the radial pressure gradient which causes the shear - induced instability would be negligible @xcite . in this letter , we focus on the last case and other possibilities will be considered in future works .",
    "we have investigated the density evolution in the dust layer due to the gi and dust settling . in  2 , a model of numerical simulations is described . in  3 , results of numerical simulations and an approximate analytical calculation are shown .",
    "finally , these results are summarized in  4 .",
    "we use the local cartesian coordinate system ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) rotating with @xmath4 at a representative distance @xmath5 from the central star , where @xmath4 is the circular keplerian angular velocity , instead of the inertial system ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath3 ) with its origin at the central star .",
    "we use approximations in which only linear terms of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) are left and higher order terms are neglected : @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in this letter , the dust layer is assumed to be axisymmetric with respect to the rotation axis , i.e. , any physical quantity is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "we assume the region where the radial pressure gradient at equilibrium is negligible so that the shear - induced instability is avoided .",
    "the equations of continuity and motion of the dust and gas , and the poisson equation for the self - gravitational potential are solved numerically .",
    "the tidal , the coriolis and the self - gravity forces on the dust and gas are applied .",
    "additionally , the gas drag force on the dust and its reaction and the pressure gradient forces on the gas are applied . the gas drag and",
    "its reaction forces depend on the gas friction time @xmath10 , which is defined as the time during which the relative velocity between a dust aggregate and gas becomes @xmath11 .",
    "the dust pressure gradient force is assumed to be neglected because random velocities of dust aggregates are sufficiently suppressed by the gas drag force before the gi grows if @xmath12 .",
    "all dust aggregates are assumed to have the same gas friction time which is constant for time .",
    "the gas is assumed to be incompressible .",
    "this assumption is good in the dust layer as explained in @xcite .",
    "the gaussian dust density distribution in the direction vertical to the midplane is used as the unperturbed density .",
    "the initial value of the density at the midplane is assumed to be equal to the critical density of the gi @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "unperturbed velocities of the dust and gas are set to zero in the @xmath1 direction and the keplerian velocity in the @xmath2 direction because we assume that the radial pressure gradient is negligible . in the @xmath3 direction ,",
    "the unperturbed gas velocity is set to zero and the unperturbed dust velocity is given by the terminal settling velocity : @xmath14 + where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the density of the gas and dust , respectively .",
    "as an initial condition , we give only the dust density perturbation which has the critical wavelength of the gi obtained by the linear analysis @xcite and the maximum amplitude of a hundredth of the unperturbed dust density .",
    "the perturbed velocities of the dust and gas are set to be zero . in numerical simulations , boundaries in the @xmath1 direction",
    "are assumed to have a period of the critical wavelength .",
    "we assume that the gas density and the dust surface density are equal to those of the minimum mass solar nebula model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) at 1 @xmath17 , but results are not sensitive to these assumptions and the only important parameter is the nondimensionalized gas friction time @xmath18 ( hereafter we denote nondimensional time and density by diacritic tilde , which are normalized by @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively ) .",
    "the density evolution for @xmath21 is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . in the early stage of the numerical simulation ( see figs . [ fig1]a and [ fig1]b ) , the growth rate of the gi is so small that the density around the midplane mainly increases by dust settling .",
    "next , the gi grows faster than dust settling and the dust layer in the calculated region changes into a ring circling the central star ( see fig . [ fig1]c ) .",
    "afterwards , the density has a maximum value on the left and right in the ring and concave density distributions arise in the vicinity of a maximum density ( see fig . [",
    "subsequent evolution of the density is significant , but we should perform three dimensional numerical simulations because nonaxisymmetric modes may grow in this stage .    the snapshot of the density at @xmath22 for @xmath23 is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the settling velocity of dust aggregates ( eq . [ [ wd ] ] ) for @xmath23 is ten times as large as that for @xmath21 due to the difference of the gas friction time .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that dust settling is faster than the growth of the gi as long as the dust density at the midplane is smaller than about twenty times of the critical density of the gi .     for @xmath23 .",
    "the length scales , the gas density , the upper boundary , and the simulated region are the same as figure [ fig1 ] . note that the maximum value of the density is different from figure [ fig1].,width=312 ]    for @xmath23 , dust settling is faster than the growth of the gi within the time interval of the numerical simulation .",
    "however , the numerical simulation is performed for the density only up to about twenty times the critical density . here",
    ", we show that dust settling is faster than the growth of the gi regardless of the dust density at the midplane . the dust settling time @xmath24 during which the dust density increases by a factor of @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 + using a rough approximation described in appendix a. if @xmath27 : the vertical component of the self - gravity of the dust in the dust layer is much larger than the sum of vertical components of the central star s gravity and the self - gravity of the gas , the dust settling time is approximately equal to @xmath28/(\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\rm{d } } \\tilde{t}_{\\rm{f}})$ ] . on the other hand , if @xmath29 , @xmath30 $ ] , and @xmath24 results in @xmath31 for the minimum mass solar nebula model because @xmath32 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the dust settling time with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "( upper solid line ) and @xmath34 ( lower solid line ) and the growth time of the gi with the gaussian dust density distribution ( bold line ) .",
    "the gas density @xmath35 is shown by the dotted line .",
    "the critical density of the gi @xmath36 is shown by the dashed line.,width=312 ]    the growth time of the gi is given by the reciprocal of its growth rate .",
    "the growth rate is obtained using the method written in  3 and  4 of @xcite by assuming that the dust density distribution in the direction vertical to the midplane is kept to be gaussian regardless of the value of the dust density at the midplane .",
    "although the dust density distribution will diverge from the gaussian as dust aggregates settle , this assumption is fairly good for our rough estimate .",
    "the growth time of the gi with the gaussian dust density distribution is shown in figure [ fig3 ] for comparison with the dust settling time .",
    "after the dust density exceeds the critical density , the growth time of the gi decreases rapidly , and is proportional to the dust density to the power @xmath37 for @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dust settling time is the constant value for @xmath39 , and is proportional to the dust density to the power @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that the gi grows faster than dust settling up to thirty times of the critical density for @xmath33 ; on the other hand , dust settling is always faster than the growth of the gi for @xmath42 .",
    "the results of the approximate analytical calculation agree with those of the numerical simulations .",
    "we have investigated the density evolution in the dust layer due to the gi and dust settling by numerical simulations and the analytical calculation . if @xmath21 , the numerical simulation shows that the gi grows faster than dust settling .",
    "this path of the gi is considered to be analogous with the case of @xcite applying the one - fluid model which the dust and gas have the same velocity due to the strong coupling by the gas drag force , although our simulations take into account the velocity difference of the dust and gas . on the other hand , if @xmath23 , the numerical simulation shows that dust settling is faster than the growth of the gi as long as the dust density at the midplane is smaller than about twenty times of the critical density of the gi . in this case",
    ", the approximate analytical calculation reveals that dust settling is faster than the growth of the gi regardless of the dust density at the midplane , so the dust layer will become extremely thin .",
    "subsequently , the gi will grow in the extreme thin dust layer with much smaller wavelengths than the critical wavelength , and then modes with larger wavelengths may begin to grow slowly .",
    "this path of the gi is considered to be analogous with the case of @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results indicate that the difference of the nondimensional gas friction time leads to two evolutional paths of the axisymmetric gi .    in order to confirm whether the planetesimal formation by the gi is possible or",
    "not , nonaxisymmetric calculations are essential .",
    "we plan to perform the numerical simulations and investigate three dimensional evolution of the gi in subsequent papers .",
    "numerical simulations have been performed on vpp5000 at the astronomical data center of the national astronomical observatory of japan and on eserver p5 595 at computing and communications center of kyushu university .",

    "here , we show how to derive equation ( [ t_settle ] ) .",
    "although the dust density is not constant for @xmath3 , we here assume @xmath43 and @xmath44 for a rough estimate of the growth time of the dust density .",
    "then the continuity equation of the dust is written               + where @xmath49 is an arbitrary constant of integration . from equation ( [ t - app ] ) , the dust settling time during which the dust density increases by a factor of @xmath25 results in equation ( [ t_settle ] ) .",
