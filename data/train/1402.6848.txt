    "granular systems exhibit a rich phenomenology that is far from being well understood .",
    "when they are fluidized , many of the observed features have a strong similarity to what happens in ordinary , molecular fluids .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising the great deal of effort made to develop a hydrodynamic theory for granular gases , i.e. for granular systems under conditions in which the particles move freely and independently between binary collisions @xcite .",
    "although the success of granular hydrodynamics is undeniable , there are still many open fundamental questions , whose answer can only be obtained by using kinetic theory and statistical mechanics methods @xcite .",
    "granular gases are inherent non - equilibrium systems due to inelasticity of collisions .",
    "there is no equilibrium state that can be used as a zeroth order or reference local state when developing a theory to describe the possible states of a system .",
    "instead , there is a homogeneous state , with uniform hydrodynamic fields , which cools monotonically in time : the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) @xcite .",
    "this essential feature has relevant implications in the structure of the macroscopic transport equations @xcite .",
    "a steady situation can be reached if energy is continuously supplied to a granular gas . in general",
    ", the price to be paid is that the system develops spatial inhomogeneities , in such a way that the energy dissipated in collisions is compensated by the energy flux associated to the hydrodynamic gradients .",
    "nevertheless , it has been observed in experiments that it is possible to generate an _ almost _ uniform steady state of a granular gas by considering the horizontal dynamics of a vibrated system confined to a quasi - two - dimensional geometry @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of the dynamics of the two - dimensional fluid generated in this way is a relevant physical question .",
    "of course , the main issue is to describe how the energy is translated from the wall vibrating in the vertical direction to the horizontal degrees of freedom of the particles .",
    "a first possibility is to consider an external noise force acting on each particle @xcite . although it is true that this modeling leads to the existence of a uniform steady state , its possible relation with the state generated in the experiments with vibrated confined granular gases",
    "has not been established .",
    "very recently , an alternative approach to the description of the two - dimensional dynamics of a confined granular gas has been proposed @xcite .",
    "the idea is to substitute the real three - dimensional collision rule by an effective two - dimensional one , trying to capture the mechanism for which the particles convert their kinetic energy associated to the vertical component of the velocity into kinetic energy in the horizontal plane .",
    "that makes a conceptually important difference with the stochastic models mentioned above .",
    "while in the latter the rate of injection of energy into the two - dimensional motion of the particles is independent of their collision rate , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite it is precisely the collision rate what controls the interchange of energy between the vertical and horizontal degrees of freedom .",
    "for this reason , we refer to this model as to a collisional one .",
    "the main features of its homogeneous steady state were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the dynamics of the system towards the steady state , assuming that it remains always homogeneous , will be addressed .",
    "the interest of this issue is twofold .",
    "firstly , it will provide useful information to validate the model by comparing its predictions with molecular dynamics results of vibrated granular systems and even with experiments .",
    "work is presently in progress along this line .",
    "secondly , it permits to study hydrodynamics around non - equilibrium steady states in one of the simplest possible scenarios .    in ordinary fluids ,",
    "the only translationally invariant hydrodynamic state is equilibrium .",
    "there is no possible hydrodynamic evolution of the temperature if the hydrodynamic fields are homogeneous . on the other hand ,",
    "isolated granular fluids have a time - dependent non - equilibrium homogeneous state , the hcs , as mentioned above .",
    "the time evolution of the temperature of a granular gas in this state obeys a macroscopic , hydrodynamic equation .",
    "when external energy is continuously supplied to a granular gas , a homogeneous steady state can be possible , depending on the way in which the energy is injected .",
    "this is what happens in the confined vibrated systems being modeled here . in this case , the existence of an homogeneous hydrodynamic regime , characterized by a closed equation for the evolution of the temperature towards its steady value , can be expected on the appropriate time scale . in the context of kinetic theory ,",
    "hydrodynamics is guaranteed if the time evolution of the system is described by a _",
    "normal _ velocity distribution , having the property that all its time dependence occurs through the granular temperature .",
    "this implies some scaling property of the distribution function .",
    "the particular form of the scaling depends on the number of parameters defining the system ( or the model ) and their nature .",
    "the case of a granular gas driven by an external stochastic thermostat has already been studied and the existence of homogeneous hydrodynamics established  @xcite . in this work",
    ", a similar analysis will be presented for the collisional model of confined granular gases .",
    "it is worth to stress the relevance of this homogeneous time - dependent hydrodynamic state .",
    "when elaborating a theory for hydrodynamics in a confined granular gas , the general zeroth order in the gradients reference state to be considered is not a local version of the stationary state eventually reached by the system , but a distribution based on the time dependent state characterizing the homogeneous hydrodynamics .",
    "only when the system is considered to be close to the steady situation , linearization around this state will be allowed . for general hydrodynamic states ,",
    "an expansion around a local time - dependent state has to be considered .",
    "the reason for this is that a steady state occurs when the rate of variation of the temperature vanishes .",
    "this gives a relationship between the temperature and some parameters of the system . as a consequence ,",
    "the temperature is not arbitrary but fixed in the steady state , and there is not a unique way of identifying the dependence on the temperature of the distribution function of that state .",
    "consequently , it makes no sense to use this state to define arbitrary hydrodynamic fields as the starting point of the chapman - enskog method .",
    "this is a quite general feature of steady non - equilibrium states , as discussed in a seminal paper by lutsko @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the model is formulated in a concise way , and some results previously derived are summarized .",
    "assuming the existence of an homogeneous normal solution of the pseudo - liouville equation of the system , formally exact equations are derived for the evolution of the temperature and the one - particle distribution function .",
    "the later is the first equation of an infinity hierarchy , as usual in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . in order to close it and get a kinetic equation ,",
    "the enskog approximation is used in sec .",
    "moreover , calculations are restricted to the first sonine correction to a gaussian distribution .",
    "then , it is possible to obtain an expression for the temperature rate and also an equation for the coefficient @xmath0 in front of the first sonine correction .",
    "the equation has a special solution such that all the other solutions tend to it , before reaching the steady value .",
    "this kind of behaviour corresponds to the existence of hydrodynamics , in the sense that all the time dependence of the distribution function occurs through the temperature . in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , the theoretical predictions are compared with simulation results obtained by means of the direct simulation monte carlo method , and a quite good agreement is found .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ s4 ] contains a short summary and discussion of the main results .",
    "the system considered is composed of @xmath1 identical hard spheres ( @xmath2 ) or disks ( @xmath3 ) of mass @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 enclosed in a volume @xmath6 .",
    "although the particular application of the model in mind is restricted to a two - dimensional dynamics , it will be developed for arbitrary dimension .",
    "the reason is that it can be done with little additional effort , and it could be useful in the future for other potential applications .",
    "the position and velocity coordinates of the particles will be denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics consists of free streaming until a given pair of particles @xmath8 are at contact . at this moment ,",

    "in this paper , the macroscopic equation for the homogeneous evolution of the collisional model recently proposed to describe the two - dimensional dynamics of confined granular gases @xcite , has been investigated .",
    "it has been shown that there is a hydrodynamic regime in which the evolution of the temperature is accurately described by a closed first order differential equation . in the context of non - equilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics , hydrodynamics is characterized by a _",
    "normal _ distribution function of the system , having the peculiarity that all its time dependence occurs through the ( granular ) temperature .",
    "thus dimensional analysis implies some scaling of the distribution function .",
    "the precise form of the scaling is a consequence of the formulation of the model .",
    "the latter involves a characteristic velocity , @xmath15 , describing the way in which the energy is transferred from the vertical degree of freedom to the horizontal ones through the collisions between particles .",
    "that means that two independent dimensionless quantities can be made by scaling with the thermal velocity , one from the particles velocity , @xmath138 , and another from the characteristic speed , @xmath15 . in general , the distribution function of the normal state can depend on both , and this must be taken into account when deriving the form of the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "it is important to stress that this is not a peculiarity of the model discussed here .",
    "a similar behavior has been found in granular systems driven by an external stochastic thermostat @xcite . with more generality ,",
    "the same can be expected when studying hydrodynamics around a steady state of a molecular fluid @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the characterization of the steady state necessarily involves some gradient of a hydrodynamic field and , therefore , an additional magnitude to be scaled out with some function of the temperature .",
    "although the dependence of the normal distribution function on the scaled characteristic velocity , @xmath102 , plays no relevant quantitative role in the macroscopic evolution of the temperature or in its steady value , it is fundamental to develop a formally consistent theory . only taken that dependence into account , the kinetic equation admits a normal solution . in any case , this new dependence will clearly show up also when studying the hydrodynamic fluxes in the system and it will affect the form of the transport coefficients .",
    "it might happen that it be quite relevant in this context , and gave quantitatively important corrections to the transport coefficients , affecting even the stability analysis .",
    "another relevant issue is that the time - dependent normal distribution function describing the homogeneous hydrodynamics can not be inferred from the distribution of the steady state , since in the latter the temperature is fixed by some condition , namely the vanishing of the rate of change of the temperature .",
    "when deriving hydrodynamic equations by means of an expansion in the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields , e.g. by an extension of the chapman - enskog method @xcite , the zeroth order distribution must describe an state with arbitrary uniform deviations of all the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "in other worlds , it is the hydrodynamic time - dependent homogeneous state discussed in this paper the one to be used .",
