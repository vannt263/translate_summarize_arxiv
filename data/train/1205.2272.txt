    "photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) are commonly used for detection of photon signals in scintillation detectors . in the case of low - background detectors ,",
    "the proximity of the pmts to the active scintillation region can lead to a background dominated by pmt radioactivity .",
    "understanding pmt radioactivity and selecting pmts based on radiopure material composition is therefore of primary importance for experiments making use of low - background detectors , as the use of ultra - low background pmts can greatly extend background - free running times .",
    "the lux dark matter direct detection experiment uses 350  kg of liquid xenon for the detection of recoils resulting from the scattering of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite .",
    "the experiment uses 122 hamamatsu r8778 pmts directly above and below the active region to detect scintillation light from xenon nuclear recoils @xcite .",
    "r8778 pmts are well suited for use in liquid xenon detectors .",
    "xenon scintillation light is narrowly peaked at 178  nm @xcite ; the lux r8778 pmts feature a measured average 33% quantum efficiency and 90% collection efficiency at this wavelength .",
    "they offer single - photon sensitivity with a resolution of 30% .",
    "their 4.5  cm diameter photocathode allows for high surface area coverage per tube compared to pmts used in previous xenon dark matter detectors , such as the 2.2  cm r8520 @xcite .",
    "the r8778 was also specifically designed to operate at liquid xenon temperatures , in the range 165 - 180  k. extensive testing has been performed on the lux pmts , and their behavior in liquid xenon is well understood .    through extensive screening and material selection , it has been possible to render the background contributions from other lux construction materials subdominant to that of the pmts @xcite .",
    "the pmts contribute backgrounds in the form of gamma rays and neutrons produced by radioactive decay , as well as neutrons from ( @xmath11,n ) reactions in pmt materials .",
    "neutron backgrounds are of particular importance to dark matter detectors due to their similarity to a wimp nuclear recoil signal .",
    "precise measurements of all radioactive isotopes must be made to ascertain the impact of the pmts on lux backgrounds .",
    "lux has initiated a development program in conjunction with hamamatsu to identify candidate pmts for use in future dark matter detectors .",
    "the lux - zeplin ( lz ) liquid xenon detector will be a factor of @xmath1220 larger in mass than lux , with corresponding surface area increase of @xmath1224 @xcite",
    ". the pmts used in these detectors will ideally be larger than the r8778 , and offer lower radioactive backgrounds per unit area .",
    "the development program has resulted in the creation of several large - area photocathode pmts , notably the 7.6  cm diameter r11065 and its low - background variant , the r11410  mod @xcite .",
    "the r11065 was tested at brown university and was found to yield an identical response to xenon scintillation light as the r8778 , with gains measured up to @xmath13 at 1500  v and a single photoelectron resolution of 32% while immersed in liquid xenon at 175  k. the r11410  mod pmt has been selected as a candidate for use in the lz program .",

    "@xmath0u can also undergo spontaneous fission , directly producing neutrons with a contribution similar to that of ( @xmath11,n ) .",

    "neutron yields are calculated separately for each chemical compound in each component in order to more accurately account for material stopping power effects .",
    "the ( @xmath11,n ) rates for the r8778 pmts , summed for all components , are calculated as 0.60  n / pmt / yr and 0.21  n / pmt / yr for @xmath0u and @xmath1th , respectively",
    ". the spontaneous fission rate of @xmath0u is calculated as @xmath39  n / decay @xcite , yielding an additional 0.33  n / pmt / yr .",

    "neutron backgrounds are reduced in direct proportion to the product of the number of neutrons produced per pmt per unit time and the number of pmts used in the experiment . in the case of lux , the neutron background reduction factor after the r8778  pmts are replaced by r11410  mod  pmts is then @xmath10 .",
    "this represents a total of 3.0 neutrons produced from the pmt arrays per 300  live  day running time ; after single - scatter and energy cuts , which reduce event rates by over four orders of magnitude , the neutron background expectation in the wimp search energy region is virtually zero .",
    "estimates of electron recoil ( er ) background contributions from lux pmts have been generated using the luxsim monte carlo simulation package developed by lux collaborators @xcite .",
    "luxsim results indicate that the use of the r11410  mod pmt arrays , conservatively assuming activity levels equal to their measured 90% upper limit values , would change lux er backgrounds by a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "this assumes a wimp search nuclear recoil ( nr ) energy range of 5 - 25  kev@xmath42 , matching that used in the lux proposal .",
    "it is important to note that this estimate uses the current measurement of r11410  mod @xmath3co , which is expected to be significantly reduced in future production models . with a reduction of @xmath3co to levels of @xmath40.2  mbq / pmt ,",
    "the background reduction factor would become @xmath9 , again making the conservative assumption of @xmath0u / @xmath1th / @xmath2k levels equal to their measured 90% upper limits .",
    "the strong reduction in both er and nr backgrounds indicates that the r11410  mod pmts can potentially reduce the overall lux pmt background contribution below that of other construction materials used in the experiment , creating an overall change in predicted lux backgrounds of nearly @xmath41 .",
    "it is interesting to note that no further reduction in pmt radioactivity beyond the r11410  mod is useful for the lz experiment . in particular , lz faces a background `` floor '' from neutrino scattering , causing er events as well as nr events from coherent neutrino scattering @xcite .",
    "the spectra for both er and nr backgrounds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lz - nu - backgrounds ] .",
    "er backgrounds are predicted to be dominated by scattering from solar neutrinos from the p - p chain , even with the use of pmts equivalent to the lux r8778 . with the use of r11410  mod pmts in the tonne - scale experiment , the pmt nr background contribution can be reduced below the level of coherent neutrino scattering from atmospheric and diffuse supernova background neutrinos above 5  kev .",
    "this will facilitate a direct measurement of these scattering spectra .",
    "it can be noted that a pmt with an activity per surface area corresponding to r11410  mod counting results presented in @xcite ( table [ tab : pmt - screening - normalized ] ) would increase er backgrounds by a factor of @xmath127 and nr backgrounds by a factor @xmath1210 .",
    "the pmt background contributions will then be a factor @xmath121/7 that of neutrino er contributions , and in a range @xmath121/10 - @xmath121/4 that of neutrino nr contributions .",
    "experiment backgrounds are negligibly affected by this increase , as are neutrino spectra measurements .",
    "the hamamatsu r8778 and r11410  mod pmts are both well suited for use in liquid xenon scintillation detectors .",
    "the radioactive isotope content of both pmt models has been assessed .",
    "counting results for the r11410  mod pmt yield a combined @xmath0u + @xmath1th measurement below 0.7  mbq / pmt .",
    "background simulations have been used to estimate the potential reduction in lux backgrounds from replacement of the current lux pmts with r11410  mod pmts .",
    "simulation results indicate that changes of @xmath9 in lux pmt electron recoil backgrounds and @xmath10 in neutron recoil backgrounds are expected , conservatively assuming pmt activities equal to the 90% upper limits found for all benchmark isotopes , and after reduction of @xmath3co limits to < 0.2  mbq / pmt through material selection in future r11410  mod units . at this point , lux experiment backgrounds would be dominated by other construction materials , and would be well below the level of 0.1  wimp - like events during the 300  live  day running time of the experiment .",
    "the use of these pmts in the tonne - scale lz detector will reduce the pmt background contribution below the irreducible contributions from solar and atmospheric neutrinos ; no further reductions in radioactivity beyond the measurements for the r11410  mod are necessary for these next - generation experiments .",
    "the counting results presented here make r11410  mod pmts a very competitive technology for use in future large - scale xenon detectors .",
    "the counting results also offer a strong baseline for future photodetector development .",
    "the pmts have a high average measured quantum efficiency of 33% at xenon scintillation wavelengths , as well as signal gains up to @xmath13 at 1500  v. the use of ultra - low background pmts such as the r11410  mod greatly aids in the development of next - generation detectors with essentially background - free discovery potential .",
