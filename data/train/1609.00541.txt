    "the large class of perovskite compounds , generally expressed as abx@xmath0 , where a and b are cations and x is an anion , have received great attention from experimentalists and theoreticians due to their interesting properties from the fundamental physics and chemistry point of view .",
    "they possess a wide range of applications such as lenses without birefringence , and exhibit magnetism , pizeoelectrics , ferroelectrics etc.@xcite the physical properties of perovskites may also have implications towards understanding the earth s lower mantle.@xcite fluoride perovskites is one particular subclass , which has found important technological applications in the field of optics .",
    "the main advantage is that these materials can be used as light emitting materials in the deep ultraviolet regime.@xcite in the present work the three technologically important fluoroperovskite kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 are considered .",
    "they all crystallize in the cubic perovskite structure .",
    "kznf@xmath0 is a promising candidate for application as a radiation detector.@xcite several experimental studies focused on synthesis , lattice dynamics , high - pressure structural stability , elastic constants , optical absorbtion and photoluminescence.@xcite in addition , several theoretical studies of kznf@xmath0 investigated its electronic structure and optical properties , lattice dynamics and thermodynamic properties , crystal fields and influence of 3@xmath2 transition metals dopants.@xcite similar to kznf@xmath0 , the cscaf@xmath0 perovskite also was investigated in several experimental and theoretical studies addressing the electronic structure and optical properties , low energy phonon dispersion curves , green luminescence upon eu@xmath3 doping , thermodynamics at low temperatures , and the equation of state.@xcite    balif@xmath0 has been of interest for application within lithography due to the short wavelength absorption edge at 123 nm ( 10.1 ev).@xcite in addition , balif@xmath0 may also be used as an effective dopant to alter the dielectric properties of batio@xmath0.@xcite the mechanism of ionic conductivity has also been investigated in balif@xmath0 with the purpose of enhancing the ionic conductivity by means of intrinsic defects.@xcite    the infrared dielectric dispersion of balif@xmath0 measured at several temperatures confirmed that this compound is one of the most stable fluoroperovskites.@xcite this was further confirmed by inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the phonon spectrum.@xcite the electron - phonon coupling in ni@xmath3 doped balif@xmath0 has been measured and related to the change in bonding as manifested in the computed vibronic spectra.@xcite the luminescence of balif@xmath0:eu@xmath3 has been investigated under pressure.@xcite high pressure studies on fluoride compounds has resulted in various interesting physical properties .",
    "a recent high pressure experimental and theoretical studies on fluoride compound caf@xmath4 reported superionic behavior even at ambient conditions which decreases with compression.@xcite recently , the structural stability of cubic balif@xmath0 under pressure has been confirmed experimentally up to 50 gpa.@xcite similar results have been reported recently for the perovskite fluorides kmgf@xmath0 and cscdf@xmath0 using high - pressure experimental techniques up to 40 and 60 gpa , respectively.@xcite _",
    "i.e. , _ the cubic phases of kmgf@xmath0 and cscdf@xmath0 are found to be stable in the pressure ranges studied .",
    "the present paper reports the results of a systematic and comparative study of the structural properites , lattice dynamics and electronic structures , of the three perovskite fluorides kznf@xmath0 , balif@xmath0 and cscsf@xmath0 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section ii describes the computational details .",
    "the calculated ground state properties , elastic constants , and phonon dispersion curves are discussed in section iii , and section iv presents the quasiparticle band structures of the fluoroperovskite compounds .",
    "conclusions of the work are presented in section v.",
    "three complementary density functional tools have been employed to study the ground state and elastic properties , lattice dynamics , and quasiparticle band structures of kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 .",
    "the structural and elastic properties were calculated using the all - electron linear muffin - tin orbital method@xcite in the full - potential implementation of ref . .",
    "in this method the crystal volume is divided into two regions : nonoverlapping muffin - tin spheres surrounding each atom and the interstitial region between the spheres .",
    "we used a double @xmath5 spdf lmto basis set to describe the valence bands .",
    "the calculations include @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 partial waves for potassium , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 partial waves for zinc , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 partial waves for cesium , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath15 partial waves for calcium , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath16 partial waves for ba , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 partial waves for fluorine .",
    "the exchange correlation potential was calculated within the local density approximation ( lda)@xcite as well as the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) scheme.@xcite the charge density and electron potential inside the muffin - tin spheres were expanded in terms of spherical harmonics up to @xmath19=6 , while in the interstitial region , these quantities were expanded in plane waves , with 28670 waves ( energy up to 194.81 ry ) being included in the calculation .",
    "total energies were calculated as a function of volume , for a @xmath20 k - mesh , corresponding to 165 k - vectors in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , and the results fitted to the birch equation of state@xcite to obtain the ground state properties .",
    "the elastic constants were obtained from the variation of the total energy under volume - conserving strains , as outlined in ref . .",
    "the phonon frequencies were calculated based on the density functional linear - response approach@xcite within the gga,@xcite combined with the plane - wave pseudopotential method as implemented in the pwscf package.@xcite norm - conserving pseudopotentials were used to describe the valence electrons .",
    "the bz integrations were carried out with a @xmath21 monkhorst - pack ( mp ) grid.@xcite kinetic energy cutoffs of 90 ry , 90 ry and 120 ry were used for cscaf@xmath0 , balif@xmath0 and kznf@xmath0 , respectively . a @xmath22 @xmath23 mesh in the first bz",
    "was used for the interpolation of the force constants needed for the phonon dispersion curve calculations .",
    "the theoretical equilibrium lattice constant of 4.096  , 4.604  , and 4.085   for kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 , respectively , are obtained by total energy minimization and used in the phonon calculations .",
    "the electronic structures of kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 have been calculated with the quasiparticle self - consistent @xmath24 ( qsgw ) ( where @xmath25 denotes the greens function and @xmath26 denotes the screened coulomb interaction ) approximation,@xcite in the fp - lmto implementation of ref . .",
    "this calculation also included a double-@xmath5 lmto basis set ( @xmath27 ) , however additionally including the f @xmath6 and @xmath7 partial waves ( treated as local orbitals@xcite ) for better description of the unoccupied band states .",
    "an @xmath28 mp k - mesh was used for the calculation of the screened interaction , which is evaluated in the random - phase approximation .",
    "convergence tests showed only minor changes compared to a @xmath29 mesh .",
    "the most common type of @xmath24 calculations use a selfconsistent lda or gga band structure as input for the evaluation of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 operators .",
    "the special feature of the quasiparticle self - consistency in the qsgw method is that the one - particle band structure , which is used as input for the evaluation of the greens function , is iterated in a further selfconsistency loop so as to come as close as possible to the output gw band structure.@xcite though appealing from a theoretical point of view , this procedure has a tendency to slightly overestimate semiconductor gaps,@xcite a fact traceable to the neglect of vertex corrections . as a simple remedy of this ,",
    "chantis et al.@xcite suggested the hybrid qsgw ( h - qsgw ) , by which the lda and qsgw self energies are mixed in the proportions 20% - 80% .",
    "see ref . for a detailed description .",
    "here we also apply the h - qsgw method to the fluorite perovskites to monitor its effect for this class of wide - gap insulators",
    "the calculated structural properties such as lattice parameters , and bulk moduli of kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 are presented in table i along with available experimentalal information and results of other calculations . in the case of kznf@xmath0",
    "the calculated lattice parameter within lda is 0.9@xmath30 lower when compared with the experimental value and the corresponding bulk modulus is 23@xmath30 overestimated .",
    "in contrast , the calculated lattice parameter using gga overestimates the experimental value by 2.4@xmath30 , and the bulk modulus is 6.8@xmath30 too low .",
    "this is the usual trend observed in the lda and gga schemes . in the case of cscaf@xmath0 the lda calculated lattice constant is lower by 2.8@xmath30 when compared to experiments , and the corresponding bulk modulus is 44@xmath30 higher .",
    "similarly , the gga lattice parameter is 0.4@xmath30 lower and the corresponding bulk modulus is 8% too large .",
    "a similar situation is seen in the case of balif@xmath0 .",
    "the calculated bulk modulus is in excellent agreement with the two reported experimental values , which is , however , a bit fortuitous . since the calculated equilibrium volume is overestimated ( by about 0.8% ) with gga ( and underestimated by about 2.6 % with lda ) , an error solely depending on the error in volume is introduced in the calculated bulk modulus .",
    "therefore we recalculated the bulk modulus also at the experimental volume in a manner similar to our earlier work@xcite ( see table i ) .",
    "this diminishes the discrepancies between the lda and gga results , as expected .",
    "in addition , the lda bulk modulus now becomes @xmath31 than the gga for all the three compounds , and both functionals are seen to actually overestimate the bulk modulus . for kznf@xmath0 two experimental determinations of the bulk modulus are at variance . in particular the high value for the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus ( @xmath32 ) reported by ref .",
    "is at odds with the general range @xmath33 found for the fluoride perovskites by both experiments and theory .",
    "the authors suggest that the limited pressure range covered in their study may be the cause of their high fit value for @xmath34 . in figure 1",
    "the gga and lda equations of state of kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 in the pressure range from 0 to 50 gpa are compared with the available experimental data.@xcite the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent for balif@xmath0 in fig .",
    "1(c ) , while the agreement is less satisfactory for kznf@xmath0 in figure 1(a ) . a special feature in kznf@xmath0 is the role of the zn 3d states , which occur as a narrow resonance within the f valence bands reflecting their semi - localized character .",
    "their bonding properties are usually ill described in lda / gga and this may be the cause of the discrepancy here . + the elastic constants of kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 are presented in table ii along with the experimental values and other theoretical values .",
    "the lda overestimates all the c@xmath35 , c@xmath36 and c@xmath37 by between 10@xmath30 and 25@xmath30 , while the elastic constants obtained within gga are much closer to the experimental values . as for the bulk modulus",
    "the elastic constants also depend sensitively on the volume , and therefore , the same argument as for the bulk modulus can be applied here .",
    "we have however , refrained from recalculating all the elastic constants with volume correction , but wish to mention that the excellent agreement between experiment and the gga elastic constants should be interpreted with some care .",
    "another point of caution is the fact that the calculated values pertain to 0 k , while experiments are performed at room temperature .",
    "an increase in temperature generally tends to reduce the elastic constants because of thermal expansion .",
    "+ the calculated phonon dispersion curves at the optimized theoretical lattice parameters are shown in figure 2 . the available experimental inelastic neutron scattering frequencies@xcite",
    "are included and good agreement between theory and experiment is found .",
    "the dynamical stability of the cubic structures is confirmed by the absence of any imaginary modes in the calculated dispersions .",
    "there are 15 phonon branches in the full phonon dispersion since the unit cell consists of five atoms which give rise to three acoustic and twelve optical phonon branches .",
    "the agreement with experiment is excellent for balif@xmath0 , and for the few frequencies determined for cscaf@xmath0 , while there is some discrepancy to be seen for kznf@xmath0 around the lowest frequencies at the m and r points .",
    "the calculations find a noticeable gap between the lowest optical mode and the highest acoustic mode in the calculations for balif@xmath0 and cscaf@xmath0 , which does not appear in kznf@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , in cscaf@xmath0 a large second gap appear at high frequency .",
    "the experiments have only managed to map the lowest frequencies and thus can not confirm or discard this prediction . evidently , it would be of great interest to obtain experimental phonon frequencies in the higher end of the spectrum for all three compounds , in particular to test the theoretical prediction that the phonon spectrum for cscaf@xmath0 , balif@xmath0 and kznf@xmath0 contain two , one and zero gaps , respectively .    the phonon partial densities of states are also included to the right of figures 2(a)-(c ) .",
    "the acoustic modes in balif@xmath0 and cscaf@xmath0 are dominated by the motion of the heavy ba and cs , respectively , while in kznf@xmath0 the atomic masses are more similar , and the atomic vibrations are fully coupled to each other as shown in figure 2(a ) .",
    "furthermore , the acoustic band width is smaller in cscaf@xmath0 than in balif@xmath0 , which reflects the larger lattice constant of cscaf@xmath0 , while the second gap ( between 8 and 11 thz ) in the phonon spectrum of cscaf@xmath0 , which does not find a counterpart in balif@xmath0 , reflects the different masses of ca and li .",
    "thus , there is a significant li component to the highest frequencies in balif@xmath0 , while no ca weight is found in the highest cscaf@xmath0 frequency range .",
    "the qsgw band structures of kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 are presented in figure 3 .",
    "all three compounds exhibit large gaps , of 10.0 ev , 11.8 ev and 11.8 ev , respectively , which are significantly larger than the gaps calculated within the lda ( table iii ) .",
    "the experimental gap has only been reported for the case of balif@xmath0 to be 8.4 ev,@xcite which is 3.4 ev lower than the calculated qsgw value .",
    "the h - qsgw reduces the calculated gaps by about 1 ev ( table iii ) , i. e. this can not account for the discrepancy .",
    "there exists the possibility that the ideal perovskite structure assumed in the calculations is not the same as that of the crystals grown in the laboratory , which may be hampered by intrinsic defects etc .",
    "the conduction band minimimum occurs in all cases at the @xmath38 point , while the valence band maximum ( vbm ) also falls at @xmath38 for balif@xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. , _ this is a direct gap insulator .",
    "the three top valence states at @xmath38 , m and r are rather close , with m ( r ) at -0.17 ev ( -0.20 ev ) relative to the vbm in balif@xmath0 . in contrast , for cscaf@xmath0 and kznf@xmath0 the gap is indirect . in cscaf@xmath0",
    "the vbm occurs at the m point while the topmost valence state at @xmath38 is about 0.25 ev lower in energy . in kznf@xmath0",
    "the vbm occurs on the line connecting the m and r points , and the topmost valence state at @xmath38 is 1.5 ev lower in energy .",
    "the f band widths are 4.0 ev , 2.1 ev and 3.2 ev in kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the low band width of cscaf@xmath0 reflects its larger lattice constant .",
    "kznf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 have similar lattice constants , however in kznf@xmath0 the zn 3d bands falls at the bottom of the f bands partially hybridizing and thus effectively enhancing the f band width .",
    "the semicore states are slightly shifted towards higher binding energies by the gw approximation compared to their lda positions , by about 2 ev for the k 3p states of kznf@xmath0 ( located at 12 ev below vbm ) , by about 0.1 ev for the cs 5p states in cscaf@xmath0 ( located at 4.5 ev below vbm ) , and by about 0.6 ev for the ba 5p states of balif@xmath0 ( located at 9 ev below vbm ) .",
    "thus the most significant effect of the gw approximation is the more or less rigid shift of the conduction bands with respect to the valence bands , which is of the order of 5 - 7 ev for the three fluorides considered .",
    "the electronic structures and vibrational properties of the kznf@xmath0 , cscaf@xmath0 and balif@xmath0 perovskite fluorides have been investigated with density functional methods .",
    "the calculated phonon frequencies are in good agreement with experimental values , which however are limited to the lowest part of the spectrum , and a full experimental mapping of the phonon dispersion curves is desirable .",
    "the calculated pv - curve of balif@xmath0 is in excellent agreement with experiment , while the agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfactory for kznf@xmath0 , and no experimental data exist for cscaf@xmath0 .",
    "the qsgw quasiparticle band structures reveal significant insulating gaps in the fluorides studied , which are about 6 ev larger than predicted by the lda / gga .",
    "most of this effect may be seen as a rigid shift of the conduction bands with respect to the valence bands .",
    "the f valence bands are only slightly wider in qsgw than in lda , while some shifts towards higher binding energies are found for the secondary ( semi - core ) valence states .",
    "all of these effects are usual trends of the gw method , which are also observed in comparison of hartree - fock and lda band structures , hence they may be ascribed to the non - local character of the electron - electron interaction .",
