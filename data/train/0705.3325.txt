    "in the local universe , the color distribution of galaxies is bimodal , primarily reflecting a relationship between color and morphology ( e.g. , holmberg 1958 , tully et al .",
    "the red peak is populated mainly by spheroidal - like early type galaxies and the blue peak consists generally of disk - like late type galaxies , as has later been verified in detail ( hogg et al .",
    "2003 , baldry et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "both populations obey relations between their integrated @xmath2 colors and absolute @xmath1band magnitudes , a red and a blue sequence , where the colors become systematically redder with increasing luminosity ( baum 1959 ; visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; chester & roberts 1964 , visvanathan 1981 ; tully , mould , & aaronson 1982 ) .",
    "the optical colors trace the integrated light of the galaxy stellar populations and thus any correlation of color with magnitude reflects the trend of some combination of star formation history ( sfh ) , initial mass function ( imf ) , metallicity , and dust attenuation with optical luminosity .",
    "the relation for red early type galaxies is well - defined , in particular in clusters , and is generally interpreted as a correlation between metallicity and luminosity ( faber 1973 , larson 1974 ) .",
    "the small intrinsic scatter and slope of this relation has been used to place limits on the star formation and merging histories of these galaxies ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ; bower , kodama , & terlevich 1998 , van dokkum et al . 1998 )    the relation for star forming blue galaxies is not as well understood as that for passively evolving galaxies on the red sequence .",
    "the scatter is larger ( griersmith 1980 ) , its origin might be more complex , and the slope has been attributed to trends with stellar age ( peletier & de grijs 1998 , brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ) , dust attenuation ( tully et al . 1998 ) , and/or metallicity ( zaritsky , kennicutt , & huchra 1994 , bell & de jong 2000 ) , largely depending on the wavelength studied .",
    "the constraints on galaxy formation models become increasingly powerful if color - magnitude trends are studied to higher redshift , thus over a long time period .",
    "for example , kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) were able to ruled out correlation with age as the main cause for the red cmr ( cf .",
    "worthey , trager , & faber 1995 ) , because the predicted evolution of the cm sequence with redshift was more than observed . and bell et al .",

    "the deep nir imaging , the broad wavelength coverage in 7 or 8 filters from @xmath24 to @xmath25 m , and homogeneous photometry make it perfectly suited for studies of rest - frame optical colors and magnitudes ( see labb et al .",

    "we will summarize the main steps here .",
    "the two fields were observed in the nir @xmath29 and @xmath30 bands with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ; * ? ? ?",

    "we complemented the data set with existing ultradeep optical imaging from hst in the @xmath32 bands @xcite , where the passbands refer to the hst / wpfc2 f300w , f450w , f606w , and f814w filters , respectively . in the field of ms1054 - 03 a further 77 hours of nir imaging",
    "was spent on a mosaic of four isaac pointings centered on the @xmath22 cluster ms1054 - 03 @xcite .",
    "we complemented these data with wfpc2 mosaics in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands @xcite , and collected additional imaging with the vlt fors1 instrument in the @xmath35 , and @xmath19 bands . in both surveyed fields",
    "the seeing in the final nir images was @xmath36 fwhm .    in each field , we registered the images and convolved them to match the image quality of the band with the worst seeing .",
    "we detect objects in the @xmath30-band using version 2.2.2 of the sextractor software ( @xcite .",
    "we performed photometry in matched apertures , measuring colors in customized isophotal apertures defined from the @xmath30-band image , and measuring total @xmath37band magnitudes in a customized elliptical kron aperture ( sextractor mag_auto ) .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "random photometric uncertainties were estimated empirically from the flux scatter in apertures placed randomly on empty parts of the map .",
    "systematic calibration uncertainties between filters are estimated to be less than 5% .",
    "the total 5@xmath38 limiting depth for point sources is @xmath39 for the hdfs , and 23.1 for the ms1054-field .",
    "the source catalog contains a total of 833 sources from the hdfs and 1858 sources from the field of ms1054 - 03 .      for most sources we rely on photometric redshifts as spectroscopic redshifts are available for a small subset only .",
    "photometric redshifts were estimated by fitting a linear combination of redshifted empirical and model galaxy spectra to the observed flux points . the template set ranges from very blue 10 myr @xcite burst models to very red empirical elliptical templates .",
    "the algorithm is described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we only determine photometric redshifts for sources with the highest - quality photometric data .",
    "our quality cut requires that a source must have photometric information in all bands and a minimal nominal exposure time of 20% .",
    "we adopt a minimux flux error of 5% for all bands to account for absolute calibration uncertainties and for mismatches between the observations and the adopted galaxy template set .",
    "we derived photometric redshifts for the 1475 out of 2691 sources that met our quality criteria .",
    "since redshift errors are a primary source of uncertainty in the rest - frame luminosities and colors they must be well charactarized . to estimate photometric redshift errors we performed monte - carlo simulations , randomizing the observed fluxes within their errors and finding the best - fit redshift again .",
    "the method accounts for the effect of photometric uncertainties , template mismatch , and the possibility of secondary solutions ( see @xcite ) . for sources with both good photometry and spectroscopic redshifts we find good agreement between the monte - carlo redshift error @xmath40 and the difference between photometric and spectroscopic redshift @xmath41 .",
    "the mean photometric redshift uncertainty for all @xmath30-selected from direct comparison to available spectroscopy , is @xmath42 , while the accuracy for sources at @xmath43 is better @xmath44 .",
    "we identified and removed stars using the method described in @xcite .",
    "we derive rest - frame luminosties @xmath45 from the observed seds and redshift information .",
    "we estimate @xmath45 by interpolating between the observed fluxes , using the best - fit templates as a guide .",
    "details on deriving @xmath45 are described extensively by @xcite .",
    "as our rest - frame photometric filter system we use the ultraviolet hst / foc @xmath46 and @xmath47 filters and the optical filters @xmath48 and @xmath19 of @xcite , which shall be denoted as @xmath49 and @xmath19 .",
    "the @xcite system was calibrated to the dreiling and bell ( 1980 ) model spectrum for vega , while the hst / foc system was calibrated to the kurucz ( 1992 ) model for vega .    the rest - frame luminosities and colors are sensitive to the uncertainties in the photometric redshifts .",
    "therefore , in the remainder of the paper we only analyze the sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts or those with reasonable redshift uncertainties @xmath50 , keeping 1354 out of 1475 galaxies .",
    "potentially , such a quality cut could introduce a bias , e.g. , if blue galaxies were to have systematically different photo - z undertainties than red galaxies .",
    "however , we find no such color - dependence for our sample and we verified that the rest - frame color distribution of the rejected galaxies is consistent with that of the galaxies we kept in the sample . because our analysis is sensitive only to the rest - frame color distribution",
    "we expect no significant bias .",
    "the median @xmath51 for the remaining galaxies is 0.05 .",
    "the reduced images , photometric catalog , redshifts , and rest - frame luminosities are all available on - line through the fires website .",
    "the ultraviolet - to - optical color - magnitude distribution is a well - studied diagnostic in studies of low redshift galaxies ( e.g. , strateva et al . 2001 ; hogg et al . 2002 ; baldry et al . 2004 ) .",
    "quantifying this distribution out to higher redshifts will provide strong constraints on models of galaxy formation , which must reproduce these observations ( e.g. , bell et al . 2004 , giallongo et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we present the rest - frame @xmath52 colors versus absolute @xmath19 magnitude of galaxies in the fires fields . here",
    "we use the @xmath53band instead of the more common @xmath54band as it is traced by our deepest hst observations to @xmath0 . to show the evolution with time we divided the galaxies in three redshift bins centered on @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which corresponds roughly to 2.4 , 3.6 , and 5.6 gyr after the big bang with a time - span of 1 , 1.5 , and 2.7 gyrs , respectively .",
    "the redshift ranges are defined so that the rest - frame @xmath57 and @xmath19-band lie in between our observed filters , while the widths of the bins are a trade - off between reducing the effects of evolution over the time - span of the bins , while keeping a statistically significant sample in each interval .",
    "obvious from fig .",
    "1 is that at all redshifts galaxies occupy a fairly narrow blue locus in color - magnitude space .",
    "the @xmath58 blue locus consists of late - type spiral- and irregular galaxies , while the @xmath59 blue locus is populated by @xmath54dropout galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* steidel et al.1996a , b)dropout galaxies in the hdfs field were selected with the hst criteria of @xcite and @xmath54dropouts in the ms1054 - 03 field were selected with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "this is not a proper u - dropout selection per s , as the vlt / fors @xmath62 filter set does not map directly to the palomar @xmath63 filterset , but galaxies in our sample with these @xmath62 colors have synthetic @xmath63 colors which would satisfy the conservative `` c '' and `` d '' criteria of @xcite ] .",
    "the blue peak has a well - defined ridge on the blue side , while galaxy colors spread out several magnitudes to the red .",
    "furthermore , the blue ridge is tilted : more luminous galaxies along the blue ridge tend to have redder @xmath64 colors .",
    "this ridge is what we define as the color magnitude relation of blue galaxies . at the brightest magnitudes there is some evidence for an upturn of the blue cmr , where most galaxies lie to the red of the relation defined by faint galaxies .",
    "baldry et al . ( 2004 ) found qualitatively similar results at @xmath65 for galaxies in the sloan survey .",
    "the knee of this upturn evolves from roughly @xmath66 at redshift @xmath0 to @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "the scatter around the blue cmr is markedly asymmetric , as can be clearly seen at @xmath0 .",
    "the scatter has a blue ridge and a red wing , with which we mean the skew towards red colors near the peak of the distribution .",
    "it is unlikely that the blue cmr is artificial .",
    "one obvious worry is that if the templates used in the photometric redshift code are all redder than the true colors of the galaxies , then the photometric redshift algorithm could create an artificial color magnitude relation with a blue ridge .",
    "however , our template set reaches much bluer colors than what we find for the galaxies .",
    "magnitude selection effects are also unlikely to cause or affect the blue cmr ; we are not biased against galaxies that are bright in @xmath69 and blue in @xmath52 and our photometry is deep enough to ensure the trend is not caused by an apparent lack of faint red galaxies . at low redshifts",
    "@xmath70 we may perhaps start to miss some the faintest blue galaxies , as the @xmath37band selection probes significantly redder wavelengths than the redshifted @xmath1band , but this effect is small and does not affect the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "the color magnitude distribution has an extended tail to very red colors at all redshifts .",
    "the red tail extends up to 4 magnitudes and is bound in the red at low redshift by a red sequence of galaxies .",
    "the onset of the red sequence can be tentatively observed as early as @xmath71 in the field of ms1054 - 03 and becomes clearly visible in in the ms1054 - 03 field at @xmath68 .",
    "the narrow red sequence here is largely attributable to the elliptical galaxies in the cluster at @xmath22@xcite .",
    "finally , the color histograms in fig .  1 show that at the bright end the galaxy population undergoes a strong evolution in color as the relative number of luminous blue galaxies decreases with time and that of red galaxies increases . as our galaxy sample is obviously too small to describe properly the upturn at the bright magnitudes of the blue sequence or the evolution of the red sequence , the primary focus of our analysis will be on the linear part of the blue cmr .",
    "we now quantify the three main properties of the blue cmr : the slope , the zeropoint , and the color scatter around the relation . in addition",
    ", we describe the evolution with redshift .",
    "while the distribution of uv - to - optical colors and absolute @xmath1band magnitudes of faint blue galaxies may be well characterized by a linear relation , this is not true for all galaxies , certainly not at lower redshifts . as a result , a straightforward least - squares linear fit to all galaxies will fail to estimate the blue slope , unless red outliers are removed from the fit .",
    "`` robust '' techniques , such as iteratively rejecting outliers ( sigma clipping ) , or assigning low weights to outliers ( e.g. , the biweight estimator of beers , flynn , and gebhardt 1990 ) do not perform very well either because the relative number red galaxies changes significantly with redshift and becomes fairly large at @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we used an even more robust technique , called `` mode - regression '' , which works as follows . for a range of values for the slope",
    ", we calculate the distribution of residual colors relative to that slope .",
    "we choose as our best fit slope the value that results in the highest , narrowest peak in the residual color - distribution .",
    "the peak height is calculated using a gaussian kernel density estimator ; a smoothed histogram where each data point is replaced by a gaussian kernel .",
    "the width of the kernel is set to the median uncertainty in the rest - frame galaxy colors .",
    "the mode - regression technique is very insensitive to outliers as long as most galaxies are on the blue sequence , a condition that our sample satisfies .",
    "there is a small systematic dependence on the adopted width of the smoothing parameter .",
    "a large smoothing paramater flattens the slope , but in our case this systematic effect is small compared to the random uncertainties .",
    "we estimated uncertainties in the fit parameters by bootstrap resampling the color - magnitude distributions 200 times with replacement , repeating the fitting procedure , and taking the central 68% of the best - fit parameters as our confidence interval .",
    "figure [ fig.b ] shows the evolution of the slopes @xmath72 with redshift ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath52 color is used , rather than @xmath2 , because it has higher signal - to - noise and a larger wavelength baseline , which helps to detect evolution of the slope .",
    "the @xmath2 slope is also given to enable direct comparison to other work .",
    "we plot the results in the fields of the hdfs and ms1054 - 03 separately , to demonstrate the results are consistent in the independent fields .",
    "the measured evolution of the slopes from all our measurements is @xmath73 in @xmath2 or @xmath74 in @xmath52 over @xmath75 , consistent with zero .",
    "the error - weigthed mean is :    @xmath76    .the blue color magnitude relation [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]      there is some evidence from the broadband colors that the scatter at @xmath0 might be mostly due to age variations . to illustrate this point ,",
    "figure  [ fig.elv_rms ] shows the wavelength dependence of the scatter .",
    "we first plot the predictions for common dust laws , where the curves , scaled to fit the @xmath77 data , show the predicted fuv scatter if the @xmath2 scatter were purely a variation in attenuation .",
    "however , the observed @xmath78 scatter increases much less with decreasing wavelength ; the scatter in fuv colors is rather small .",
    "the wavelength dependence is much closer to predictions of age variations , here calculated from bc03 stellar populations models for a range of star formation histories with declining star formation rates ( @xmath79gyr@xmath28 ) .",
    "another way of showing the different behaviour of the blue cmr slope and scatter with wavelength is to plot the @xmath80 and u - v color magnitude relations side - to - side ( fig .  [ fig.cmr_l1l2 ] ) .",
    "the scatter ( relative to the slope ) is 3 times smaller in @xmath80 than in the @xmath2 .",
    "if the blue cmr slope and scatter were both caused by the same process , for example dust variations , then this ratio should be wavelength independent .",
    "an explanation is that the @xmath2 scatter is predominantly an age effect : @xmath2 colors of stellar populations models evolve strongly with age due to the onset of the balmer/4000  break , but less so in fuv colors .",
    "we can use the scatter in the fuv to place a simple upper limit to the contribution of dust extinction to the @xmath2 scatter .",
    "the observed fuv scatter @xmath81 is only slightly larger than the estimated photometric uncertainties .",
    "assuming it is entirely intrinsic this translates to @xmath82 for a @xcite dust - law , or almost half the observed value .",
    "we will discuss implications of the constant scatter with redshift in  5.3 , and discuss detailed modeling of its shape at @xmath0 in  6 .",
    "the cause of the blue color - magnitude relation is impossible to determine from the broadband photometry of individual galaxies alone .",
    "fits of models to the photometry produce stellar age and dust estimates which are very uncertain ( e.g. , shapley et al . 2001 , papovich et al . 2001 ) . unfortunately , more direct spectroscopic age and extinction determinations are notoriously difficult for distant galaxies .",
    "the rest - frame optical spectroscopy is generally not deep enough for the detection of h@xmath83 or for accurate measurements of @xmath84 equivalents widths over a large magnitudes range . in addition , the blue cmr is a relatively subtle feature , hence we can only investigate it properly for nearby galaxies that have high signal - to - noise integrated spectra and photometry over a large magnitude range .",
    "we analyzed the spectra of a sample of 196 nearby galaxies from the ngfs @xcite , a spectrophotometric survey of a subsample of galaxies from the cfa redshift survey ( huchra et al .",
    "the sample matches the distributions of morphology and magnitude of the nearby galaxy population , and covers a large magnitude range @xmath85 .",
    "the nfgs provides integrated broadband photometry and integrated spectrophotometry of all galaxies , including line fluxes and equivalent widths of @xmath86 $ ] , h@xmath87 , and h@xmath88 .",
    "we chose not to use the sloan digital sky survey as our low redshift comparison as the sdss spectroscopic sample covers only a small observed magnitude range ( @xmath89 mag ) in a fixed small aperture ( strauss et al .",
    "delicate completeness and aperture corrections ( e.g. , tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , @xcite ) are required to analyse correlations over a range in absolute magnitude comparable to the nfgs .",
    "the nfgs on the other hand , is very well suited as a local comparison without corrections and is already sufficient large for our purposes .",
    "we will proceed by first quantifying the correlations with @xmath69 of indicators which might be responsible for the blue cmr , most importantly dust - reddening , gas - phase metallicitym and stellar age .",
    "then we investigate whether a self - consistent solution can be found .",
    "figure  [ fig.ea ] shows the @xmath2 color versus absolute @xmath1band magnitude of nfgs galaxies , revealing the well - known color bimodality of field galaxies ( e.g. , tully et al .",
    "1982 , baldry et al . 2004 ) .",
    "a blue and a red color - magnitude relation of roughly similar @xmath2 slope are visible .",
    "a linear fit the blue cmr results in @xmath90    and can be traced from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "the total systematic color variation in this range is @xmath93  mag .",
    "we define blue sequence galaxies as those having colors within @xmath94 from the best - fit linear relation ( 106 out of 196 ) galaxies . from hereon",
    "we will analyze the spectral properties only of the blue sequence galaxies .",
    "to ensure reliable measurements of @xmath95 line ratios we limit ourselves to the 91 sources with raw @xmath96 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "seventy - five procent of the remaining sample have raw @xmath97   and @xmath98 .",
    "this quality cut removes a few more luminous galaxies than fainter galaxies with low @xmath99 , but not to a degree that significantly biases the derived relations or analysis .",
    "we note that the main reason for the absence of low @xmath99 at the highest luminosities is the color cut , which removed the passively evolving early - type galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig.eb](a ) shows the dust reddening towards regions derived from the ratio of integrated h@xmath100 and h@xmath83 fluxes and assuming the intrinsic ratio 2.85 of case b recombination @xcite .",
    "the fluxes are corrected for balmer absorption and galactic reddening @xcite .",
    "clearly , the color excess towards regions correlates strongly with @xmath69 such galaxies more luminous in the v - band suffer more attenuation .",
    "the linear fit is @xmath101 consistent the trend seen for star forming galaxies in the sdss @xcite .",
    "individual galaxies are scattered 0.10 mag rms perpendicular to the relation .",
    "the contribution of reddening to the observed broadband @xmath2 colors depends on the difference between the gas phase and stellar continuum reddening , which is a function of the geometry of the dust distribution ( e.g. , calzetti et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the differential reddening can be parameterized by @xmath102 studies of nearby and distant blue galaxies indicate a range of @xmath103 ( e.g. , kennicutt 1992 , 1998 ; calzetti et al . 1996 ; bell & kennicutt 2001 , erb et al . 2003 ) , hence the extinction toward regions is at least as high as that of the stellar continuum .",
    "it is conceivable that the value of @xmath104 appropriate for local late type galaxies is different from that of high - redshift galaxies , e.g. , perhaps the high - redshift blue sequence galaxies are more like the local uv - bright starbursts , which have @xmath105 ( calzetti et al .",
    "however , high - redshift galaxies are also different in certain respects , e.g. , they are more actively star forming for the same amount of obscuration , even taking into account selection effects ( adelberger & steidel 2000 ) and they are likely a more heterogenous sample spanning a broader range in stellar masses and sfhs . also , the values derived for local uv - bright starburst of calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) rely on colors and spectra in small apertures .",
    "hence , aperture effects should be taken into account when comparing to the integrated properties of high - redshift galaxies , which could increase @xmath104 .",

    "the h@xmath100 equivalent width is an indicator of the instantaneous star formation rate per unit optical luminosity , which is often interpreted as the star formation rate per stellar mass ( specific star formation rate ; ssfr ) or the ratio of present to past averaged star formation . fitting a linear relation @xmath116 and @xmath69 yields @xmath117",
    "note that the intrinsic slope of @xmath116 versus @xmath69 may be different from the observed slope in a way that depends on the amount of differential extinction towards emission line regions and the stellar continua @xmath104 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "if both @xmath84 and the underlying stellar continua at 6563  are equally attenuated ( @xmath118 ) , then the equivalent width @xmath119 remains unchanged . if @xmath84 is more attenuated ( @xmath120 ) , then the observed equivalent width changes by a certain amount @xmath121 , where the exact amount depends on the level of reddening . because for our sample the reddening depends on absolute magnitude ( eq .  6 ) , this means the change in @xmath99 increases with absolute magnitude , and therefore the slope of @xmath122 changes .",
    "the extinction correction that we need to apply to the observed slope to obtain the intrinsic slope is thus proportional to @xmath123 . for a @xcite dust - law",

    ", these effects nearly cancel when calculating the dust - corrected h@xmath100 equivalent width , leaving the results here almost unaffected . ]",
    "we now use the observed emission line correlations to explicitly calculate the contributions of the stellar continuum , the metallicity , and the dust attenuation to the observed @xmath2 versus @xmath69 slope for local blue galaxies .",
    "the contributions can not be derived uniquely from the individual spectral indicators , but we can derive simple relations between them using @xcite stellar population models and solve for any unknowns .",
    "details are presented in the appendix , but we will discuss the main assumptions and result here .    the naive way would be to assume a ( presumably ) appropriate star formation history and relate the observables through the model parameters .",
    "the drawback is that any reliance on star formation history might compromise the robustness of the outcome .",
    "for example , even relations that are considered fairly robust , such as the relation between the @xmath99 and the specific star formation rate still depend substantially on assumed sfh . the variation in derived ssfr between exponentially declining sfhs with timescales @xmath125",
    "gyr is approximately @xmath126 dex ( a factor of 2.5 ) over the range of @xmath99 spanned by our data ( 10 - 100 ) .",

    "the main advantage is that our observables , the correlations of observed @xmath2 , @xmath99 , @xmath128 , and @xmath111 with @xmath69 are easily expressed in @xmath127 with very little dependence on assumed sfh .",
    "the price is that we can not interpret any trend of @xmath127 directly in terms of stellar `` age '' .",
    "as shown in the appendix , we form a linear system and solve for the unkown @xmath129 and the ratio of gas - phase to continuum absorption @xmath104 .    to summarize , the observed correlations are :    @xmath130    where @xmath131 denotes @xmath132 , the slope with respect to rest - frame @xmath69 .",
    "the unique solution is : @xmath133    the contributions to the observed @xmath2 versus @xmath69 slope of the blue cmr break down as : @xmath134    the result is that only a trend of increasing dust - reddening with optical luminosity explains the spectra and broadband @xmath2 colors self - consistently , with minor contributions to the slope from the dust - free @xmath2 stellar continuum ( at fixed metallicity ) and metallicity .",

    "there is substantial scatter at fixed @xmath69 .",
    "the scatter is @xmath145 . using the model relation @xmath146 to convert @xmath2 stellar continuum colors ( see the appendix ) , we find @xmath147 .",

    "the star formation history of the galaxies averaged over the blue sequence is assumed to be smooth , which is plausible even if the sfh of individual galaxies is more irregular ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the average integrated sfr is expected to be constant or declining , as is the case at @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we assume that the ratio of gas - phase to continuum absorption @xmath104 is approximately independent of @xmath69 , as is commonly done @xcite . however , we point out that this has not been verified directly , as the distribution of dust is difficult to constrain observationally , and it should be addressed in future studies .",
    "our preliminary conclusion is that the @xmath2 color - magnitude relation for blue galaxies is dominated by systematic variations in dust reddening of the stellar continuum , with only minor contributions from intrinsic color variations of the stellar continuum ( `` age '' ) or metallicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2 color scatter perpendicular to the blue cmr is likely dominated by variations in the stellar ages or specific star formation rates .",
    "more supporting data is needed for more definitive conclusions ( e.g. , rest - frame uv and ir ) , but we will use these as a working hypothesis for the rest of the paper .      while the direct effects of metallicity on the @xmath2 stellar continuum are small , it is possible that the trend of increased reddening with rest - frame @xmath69 essentially reflects the mass - metallicity relation or luminosity metallicity relation such as found in nearby galaxies ( bell & de jong 2000 ; zaritsky , kennicutt & huchra 1994 ) , at low redshift @xcite , and at high redshift @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , this can be understood as follows .",
    "the optical depth of a star forming galaxy depends on the gas column density and gas metallicity .",
    "if both are higher for more luminous galaxies then both will increase the dust reddening . using a very crude model and local galaxy correlations of gas - fraction , stellar surface density , and metallicity with luminosity ,",

    "using the same model , we would find a slope of @xmath149 which is about twice as steep as the data , but not wildly different , especially considering the simplicity of the model .",
    "nevertheless , empirical calibrations do not explain the mechanisms that set up these correlations in the first place .",
    "taking the redshift independence of the blue cmr slope at face value suggests that the process responsible for the relation was already in place at @xmath0 , or possibly even @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "a strong contribution of stellar age or star formation history to the relation therefore seems less likely .",
    "the relative ages of galaxies along the sequence would evolve considerably over such a range in time and the blue cmr slope would steepen measurably with redshift",
    ".    on the other hand , the non - evolving blue cmr slope may be consistent with an underlying mass - metallicity relation .",
    "there is evidence that a mass - metallicity relation was already established at @xmath59 @xcite with a @xmath151  dex offset to lower metallicities but broadly similar shape to the relation at low redshift @xcite .",
    "models where less massive galaxies are less efficient at retaining the metals produced by star formation , would naturally create a mass - metallicity relation at any redshift .",
    "nevertheless , it is unclear whether galaxies on the @xmath17 blue sequence can be directly compared to those at the @xmath4 blue sequence .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the clustering properties of luminous ( blue sequence ) lbgs at @xmath7 are more comparable to local early - type galaxies then local late - type galaxies .",
    "in addition , it is unclear if the evolving densities , dust - to - gas ratios , gas fractions , and metallicities of the galaxies would result in the same effective reddening relation at all redshifts .    in the end",
    "deep , high signal - to - noise nir spectra for large numbers of high - redshift galaxies are needed to constrain the origin of the trends with metallicity , dust - opacity , and star formation history directly ( e.g. , erb et al .",
    "2006a , b ; kriek et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "if the color scatter perpendicular to the blue cmr arises largely from age variations in the stellar populations , then the redshift independence of the scatter provides clues to the formation history of blue sequence galaxies , allowing us to constrain their ensemble star formation history .",
    "this technique has been applied before using the color distribution of passively evolving red sequence galaxies ( e.g. , bower et al .",
    "1992 , van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 ) , although obviously the exact same models can not be used here as the blue sequence galaxies are still vigorously forming stars .",
    "the most simplistic approach would be to directly translate the color scatter to a variation in stellar age .",
    "assuming bc03 stellar population models with constant star formation , where the dependence of color on age is @xmath152 between @xmath153 , we find that the observed scatter @xmath154 translates to @xmath155 , or a factor of 5",
    ". the age scatter would not remain constant with time , however , and would decrease for constant sfhs because the relative age differences become smaller with increasing mean age of the sample .",
    "one way of keeping the color scatter constant is to continously add new young galaxies to the sample .    to illustrate how adding new young galaxies to a sample influences the evolution of the zeropoint and scatter",
    ", we simulate ensemble star formation histories in a simple model .",
    "here , model galaxies start forming at @xmath156 following three different time dependent distribution functions for the formation rate @xmath157 , the rate at which new young galaxies are added to the simulation : 1 ) exponentially declining with an e - folding time of 2  gyr , 2 ) constant with time , and 3 ) exponentially rising with e - folding time 2  gyr . the timescale is set to ( a somewhat arbitrary ) 2 gyr , which causes a factor of @xmath158 change in formation rate between @xmath159 . for each formation rate @xmath157",
    ", bc03 models were used to calculate the evolution of the colors and luminosities , each time adopting three different star formation history for the model galaxies : a declining sfr with e - folding time @xmath160  gyr , a declining sfr with e - folding time @xmath161  gyr , and constant star formation .",
    "we added a fixed amount @xmath162 of dust to the colors and magnitudes , adopting a @xcite reddening law . for simplicity a flat distribution in masses",
    "is assumed and a magnitude - limited sample is simulated by imposing a threshold on the luminosities . more sophisticated modeling will be explored in  6 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "each column represents the evolution for a different distribution @xmath163 .",
    "the top row shows the evolution of the mean stellar population age , where age is defined as the time elapsed since the onset of star formation , while the second and third row show the evolution of the @xmath52 color scatter and @xmath52 intercept color of the simulated samples .",
    "models that are wildly inconsistent with the data are sfhs with @xmath164gyr , or sfhs with @xmath165gyr models with declining rates of newly formed galaxies @xmath163 . in general a rising @xmath163 increases the scatter , while slowing down the evolution of the zeropoint , while a declining @xmath163 does the exact opposite .",
    "while these simple models are merely illustrative , an interesting result is that even models that are reasonably consistent with the data , fail to reproduce the detailed shape of the color distribution ( see histograms in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the reason is that the constant and exponentially declining sfrs always produces a tail to very blue colors , while they have a `` ridge '' to redder colors , as shown in the schematic in fig .  11 , in contrast to the observations",
    "this is easily understood : the continuing formation of new young systems adds galaxies with very blue colors to the sample , while the @xmath166 behaviour of the declining sfhs causes a pile - up towards redder colors and a red ridge .",
    "a similar profile can be seen for passively evolving red galaxies at low redshift and in clusters @xcite .",
    "note that allowing galaxies to evolve away from the blue sequence does not change this picture in an obvious way .",
    "in fact , if the oldest and reddest model galaxies are allowed to evolve off the blue sequence then the scatter of the blue sequence would be _ reduced_. to match the observed scatter , more newly formed blue galaxies would need to be added , exacerbating the blue wing .",
    "clearly , another way of introducing and maintaining scatter on the blue sequence is to allow complex ( `` bursty '' ) star formation histories , which are expected in models for galaxy formation @xcite and inferred from fossile evidence in local galaxies @xcite .",
    "modulation of the instantaneous star formation rate is a very effective way to change the ultraviolet - to - optical color rapidly .",
    "it requires somewhat more careful modeling as large changes in the ssfr are accompanied by large changes in luminosity .",
    "hence selection effects can substantially alter the color - distribution of a magnitude limited sample .",
    "we proceed next by constructing more complex models to explain the detailed shape of the blue cmr color distribution .",
    "we explore how the observed shape of the scatter perpendicular to the blue color - magnitude relation can be used to constrain models for the ensemble star formation histories . as shown in fig .  1",
    ", the observed scatter has a peculiar shape , with a `` ridge '' to blue colors , and a wing or tail to red colors .",
    "we will focus on the redshift range @xmath167 , where most galaxies in the observations are on the blue sequence , and discuss the implications for a selection of formation models .",
    "our basic assumption is that the color scatter arises mainly from age variations among the galaxies .",
    "we do not know whether this is true for high - redshift galaxies , but this assumption seems supported by the large variation of @xmath84 equivalent width in local blue sequence galaxies ( see  5.1 ) and the wavelength dependence of the blue cmr scatter at @xmath0 ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "we explore a set of 4 idealized models , characterized by distinct parameterizations of the star formation rates : 1 ) galaxies start forming at random redshifts , form stars at a constant rate , and after a certain time cease star formation , 2 ) galaxies start at random redshifts and have an exponentially declining star formation rate , 3 ) galaxies start at @xmath168 with constant star formation and experience random star bursts in which they produce a certain fraction of the total stellar mass , 4 ) galaxies start at @xmath168 and form stars episodically , cycling through periods of star formation followed by a periods of quiescence .    while the chosen set is not exhaustive , the models do span the whole color space that @xmath7 galaxies occupy and the parameterizations of the sfr either resemble those often used in literature , e.g. , constant or exponentially declining star formation @xcite , or are motivated by models for galaxy formation and inferences from fossile evidence in local galaxies , e.g. , bursting or episodic star formation @xcite .",
    "each model is characterized by only 2 or 3 free parameters with @xmath169500 or more independent star formation histories for each parameter combination .",
    "we do not introduce additional free parameters , such as distributions in the star formation rates , star formation timescales , or burst fractions .",
    "often these extra parameters are degenerate with respect to the resultant color distribution and can not be constrained by our data .",
    "we assume solar metallicy @xcite models and adopt a salpeter imf from 0.1 to 100 @xmath170 to generate the colors .",
    "for every monte - carlo realization we save the model parameters , colors , magnitudes , sfrs and masses , which are compiled into 4 model libraries containing on the order of @xmath171 unique star formation histories . for each parameter combination",
    "we construct color distributions that reflect the changes in the specific star formation rate and compare them to the data ( see @xcite and @xcite for similar studies at low redshift ) .",
    "a desirable feature of this type of analysis is that fitting of the observed color distribution resolves , in a statistical sense , some of the degeneracies that occur in fitting the broadband colors of individual galaxies ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , a galaxy observed shortly after a single burst might have similar colors as an older galaxy that is forming stars at a constant rate .",
    "however , bursting and constant star formation histories applied to an ensemble of galaxies give rise to very different color distributions .      we need to account for two aspects of the observations before comparing the models to the data : the observations are magnitude limited , and the observed scatter contains contributions from uncertainties in the rest - frame colors and from variations in dust content .",
    "a magnitude limit can substantially alter the resulting color distribution if individual galaxies in the models evolve strongly in luminosity and color .",
    "for example , a faint otherwise undetected galaxy undergoing a burst of star formation will temporarily turn blue and increase in luminosity .",
    "the galaxy can now enter a magnitude - limited sample and thereby change the color distribution .",
    "the amplitude of this effect depends on the relative number of faint galaxies , hence on the steepness of the luminosity function ( lf ) .    to simulate the effect of a magnitude limit",

    "we find no such correlation in our ( deeper ) data .",
    "we will adopt @xmath172 of @xcite , noting that the faint - end slope is considerably uncertain , but that the results here are not very sensitive to the exact value of @xmath100 .",
    "we apply the lf in the following way .",
    "we convert a schechter luminosity function with @xmath177 and @xmath172 @xcite to an approximate mass function using an average @xmath178 appropriate for our blue galaxies @xcite .",
    "if @xmath179 depends systematically on mass , the slope of the derived mass function would be different .",
    "however , the implied change from correlations in our sample is smaller than the uncertainty in the adopted faint end slope , so we do not include this effect .",
    "random values are drawn from the mass function , to well below the mass - limit corresponding to our magnitude limit and adopted @xmath179 , and the properties of individual model galaxies ( luminosity etc . )",
    "are scaled to those masses .",
    "this approach allows galaxies to `` burst into '' or `` fade out '' of the sample when the instant ( specific ) sfrs , luminosities , and colors , evolve with time .",

    "we approximate this effect by fitting linear relations to the color uncertainties as function of @xmath69 .",
    "we then apply the luminosity - dependent uncertainties to the model by randomly varying the model fluxes within the errors .",
    "the median error in the rest - frame @xmath52 color is 0.14 mag in the hdfs and 0.19 mag for the ms1054 field .",

    "we ignore the modest evolution of the blue cmr evolution over the redshift interval @xmath189 in both fields , which would have added @xmath190 mag to the scatter .    finally , we draw samples of galaxies from the model libraries matching the observed redshift distribution and impose magnitude limits of m@xmath191 for the hdfs and m@xmath192 for the somewhat shallower ms1054 - 03 field .",
    "the limits correspond to the magnitudes to which the samples are complete for all sed types and galaxy colors .      before fitting the mock distributions to the data ,",

    "hence , we will focus on the residual color distribution perpendicular to the blue cmr intercept at @xmath183 .    for each model and parameter combination",
    "we calculate the two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic of the mock color and the observed distribution , giving us the probability that both were drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the ks test is attractive because it is non - parameteric , does not require binning of the data , and is relatively insensitive to outliers .",
    "however , it is quite sensitive to the median of the distribution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is undesirable .",
    "our principal interest is to study the characteristic shape of blue cmr scatter , i.e. the blue ridge and red wing as explained in fig .  11 , not the precise value of the median , which may be sensitive to our assumptions about the imf and the amount and type of dust added .",
    "therefore , we subtract the median of both the model and the observed colors before calculating the ks statistic , but we will also discuss the results of a direct ks test where interesting .",

    "the sfr of an individual galaxy is constant for a certain time @xmath196 after which it drops to zero .",
    "the model has two free parameters : @xmath195 , sampled in 20 steps of 0.2 between @xmath197 , and @xmath196 , sampled logarithmically in 10 steps from 0.08 to 3 gyr .",

    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath199 and @xmath200  gyr with fairly low ks probability p=0.07 .",
    "the reason is that the model never reproduces the red wing : the skew towards red colors near the peak of the blue cmr .",
    "although the model can produce red galaxies in abundance , it does so by creating a build - up of passively evolving galaxies in a second red peak ( see fig  13 ) .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the @xmath52 color evolution of passively evolving stellar populations : the colors evolve rapidly away from the blue cmr and converge at the red peak ( see fig  12a , b ) .",
    "sudden cut - offs in star formation thus do not produce a prominent red wing .",
    "the model _ can _ reproduce the small scatter of galaxies colors while on the blue sequence .",
    "this follows directly from the @xmath201 color evolution of constant sfr models : for approximately constant star formation histories a large scatter in stellar population age causes only a modest scatter in color .    to understand better the behaviour of this model we calculated the confidence regions of the free parameters by bootstrapping the observed distribution 200 times , each time finding the best - fit parameters and identifying the ks - contours in the original probability map that encompass 68% and 95% of the best - fit monte - carlo realizations .",

    "it resembles a formation model were a galaxy forms @xmath224rd of its stellar mass in an initial burst , after which it forms the rest in residual constant star formation over an extended time .",
    "the model reproduces the correct shape of the color distribution , i.e. , a blue cut - off and red wing .",
    "the blue cut - off is the result of the high formation redshift and the lack of newly formed , very young galaxies .",
    "the red wing is caused by galaxies in the post - starburst phase , where large numbers of red a - stars formed in the burst outshine the blue o- and b - stars formed in the residual star formation .",
    "the main disagreement is the absolute mean color , which is too red .",
    "this is partly because of the higher ( @xmath168 ) formation redshift , thus higher stellar population ages , but also because successive bursts substantially _ redden _ a stellar population with respect to constant star formation . hence changing to a lower formation redshift",

    "the reason for the redder average color is the dominant contribution to the light of the post - starburst population .    the confidence regions in fig .",

    "* ) , which would allow higher burst frequencies .",
    "we obtain similar results if the extra attenuation is more than 1 magnitude .",
    "the roughly inverse proportional relation between the best - fit frequency and burst strength shows that both parameters contribute comparably to creating the red wing ; i.e. , the model can now produce a red wing through more frequent smaller bursts , or through fewer more massive bursts .      in model 4",

    "episodic models with high duty cycles naturally reproduce the characteristic features of the observed scatter .",
    "the narrow blue peak with a blue ridge in this model is caused by the high formation redshift and constant star formation rates .",
    "the red wing results from the short inactive period , in which galaxies briefly depart from the blue cmr without ever moving far away .",
    "incidently , the episodic model is the only model that also produces the correct blue absolute colors at @xmath7 interval ( @xmath237 , comparable to the observations , see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the origin of the blue color is a typical aspect of episodic sfhs : when star formation resumes after the quiescent period , the color of the population is bluer than before quiescence ( see e.g. , fig .  18a ) .",
    "the reason is that the stellar population formed previously has faded during the inactive period , thus on resuming activity there are fewer intermediate aged stars (  @xmath238 years ) contributing to the uv luminosity , which is then dominated by younger , bluer , stars .",
    "the color evolution with time is substantially slower than constant star formation helping the model galaxies to maintain extremely blue colors despite the high @xmath168 formation redshift .",
    "the only mismatch to the data is the deficit in the models of very red galaxies @xmath239 , galaxies that are 1.6 mag redder than the blue sequence zeropoint .",
    "the confidence regions of parameters @xmath230 and @xmath226 at fixed @xmath234 ( see fig .  [ fig.l ] ) show that the duty cycle is best constrained , with 68% confidence levels at fixed @xmath228 of @xmath240 , while the period of the cycle may vary from 150  myr to 600  myr ( 68% ) .",
    "20 shows the confidence regions as a function of residual star formation rate @xmath228 . clearly ,",
    "if the quiescent star formation rates are higher , then the duty cycle can be lower because the model galaxies redden more slowly between the burst .",
    "however , the contrast in star formation rate between activity and quiescence must be at least a factor of 5 ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "we have illustrated how the shape of color scatter might be used to constrain simple parameterizations for the ensemble star formation history of galaxies on the blue sequence .",
    "before we discuss its implications , we stress that our models are on purpose a limited and idealized set and not necessarily exhaustive .",
    "while the models can clearly reproduce some or all of the important characteristics of the blue sequence , there may be other paramerizations of the sfr or treatment of dust that can reproduce the characteristics as well .",
    "in addition , if the degree of reddening depends on stellar age ( e.g. , charlot & fall et al .",
    "2000 , shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) then the picture is complicated further as star formation history and dust evolution can only be constrained simulatenuously . as such",
    "our results are not definitive or unique .",
    "however , it is certainly instructive to see the ensemble color evolution of more complex star formation histories parameterized in a simple way .",
    "several general conclusion can be drawn from the observations of the blue sequence in  3 and  4 and the modeling of ensemble star formation histories in  5.2.2 and  6 .",
    "first of all , it is clear from  6.3.1 and  6.3.2 that the simplest models ( e.g. , constant sfr and cut - off , and declining sfrs ) , fit the observed color distribution and its evolution rather poorly .",
    "it can be easily seen from the linear @xmath242 and power law @xmath243 color evolution of exponentially declining and constant sfhs , that simple randomized distributions of such templates can never create the correct shape of the color distribution , i.e. , a blue ridge and a red wing .",
    "such simple sfhs are widely used for modeling the broadband seds of individual high - z galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hence their derived properties should be interpreted with caution .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable that a simplistic csf model can roughly reproduce some of the observed trends with redshift , such as the small evolution of the scatter with redshift and the approximate linear evolution of the intercept over @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "this may indicate that blue sequence galaxies are actively forming stars at nearly constant rate most of the time , and that their sfhs are rather similar over long periods @xmath244  gyr .",
    "@xcite already argued that constant or declining sfh are probably wrong for most high - redshift galaxies , as they lead to inferred ages @xmath245  myr for @xmath246 lbgs in the hdfn with relatively small scatter .",
    "such an age distribution , much smaller than the cosmic time span of @xmath247 ( @xmath1691 gyr ) is implausible unless the galaxies are evolving in sync ( impossible ) or the assumed sfh and hence the implied age is wrong ( likely )",
    ". episodic or bursty star formation histories provide an alternative by rejuvenating the appearance of the galaxies , possibly allowing much higher ages and inferred formation redshifts .",
    "the repeated burst model with underlying constant star formation ( model 3 ) reproduces two key features of the color distribution : relatively small scatter , caused by the constant star formation , and a red wing , caused by the red colors of the post - starburst stellar populations  off setting the model galaxies to the red of the blue cmr .",
    "the bursts have to be massive with mass fraction formed in the burst @xmath248% because the fading starburst needs to outshine the on - going star formation .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "16 , where galaxies burst briefly to high luminosities and ultrablue colors , then fade to redder colors , and ultimately return to the blue sequence driven by the on - going star formation .",
    "the predicted evolution of the model is rather different from the observations however , with a strongly increasing scatter with time ( see fig .  21 and fig .  22 ) .",
    "this is caused by our choice of parameterization for the burst strength , which was expressed as a fraction of the total stellar mass formed , leading to burst that are increasingly powerful .",
    "the strength of the burst is rather problematic , even at early times . at @xmath17",
    "the model predicts @xmath249 fold increases in sfr during a burst .",
    "this would produce blue galaxies with sfrs exceeding @xmath250 m@xmath251yr@xmath28 , which are not observed .",
    "that being said , for a frequency @xmath252  gyr@xmath28 and burst duration of 50  myr , we would only expect approximately 5 such sources in our fields , hence their absence is only marginally significant .",
    "in addition , star formation and obscuration are known to correlate at low and high redshift ( e.g. , adelberger & steidel 2000 ) , so if the starburst episode is highly obscured the galaxies might briefly resemble extreme heavily obscured starbursts , such as those detected in the sub - mm ( e.g. , chapman et al .",
    "2000 ) .    the episodic star formation model ( model 4 ) , here modeled as a simple step function modulation of the sfr , explains the key features of the blue sequence surprisingly well .",
    "the model reproduces the correct shape of the color scatter , with a narrow blue ridge , because of constant star formation and high formation redshift , and a red wing , resulting from the short inactive period in which galaxies briefly depart from the blue cmr . the predicted evolution in zeropoint and scatter ( see fig .",
    "22 ) is roughly consistent with the data .",
    "the most important parameter in this model is the duty cycle , or the fraction of time spent in the `` active '' state , which our observations constrain to @xmath253 if the contrast in star formation rate is a factor of 50 .",
    "the combined constraint on duty cycle and variation of star formation rate is that the observations require at least a 40% duty cycle and at least a factor of 5 variation of the star formation rate ( at 95% confidence , see fig .",
    ". a factor of 5 in sfr in this binary active - passive model , corresponds to 0.35 dex of scatter in @xmath8 around the mean .",
    "interestingly , the color evolution for this model is slower than that of constant star formation , making the average galaxy significantly bluer for the same age than a galaxy with a constant star formation ( see fig .",
    "if blue sequence galaxies at @xmath17 really have such episodic sfhs , many of them could have started forming at much higher redshifts than would be inferred from their average stellar population age , suggesting a blue cmr might exist at significantly earlier times .",
    "shapley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have suggested that @xmath59 galaxies may pass in and out of uv - selected and near - ir color - selected samples as they evolve from phases of active star formation , when they are blue , to quiescence , when they are red , and back again .",
    "an interesting question is to see whether an episodic model can explain the tail to very red colors of galaxies with @xmath254 mag .    in our @xmath59 observations red galaxies are almost exclusively @xmath255faint distant red galaxies , which can be selected by @xmath256 ( franx et al .",
    "2003 ; see fig .  1 ) .",
    "half of the luminous @xmath257 drgs at @xmath7 have @xmath254 mag . by number",
    "they make up about 15% of all luminous @xmath257 galaxies .",
    "we find that our best - fit episodic model does not produce substantial numbers of such very red galaxies ( only @xmath258% of @xmath257 ) , due to the high duty cycle and the brief time spend in quiescence .",
    "naturally , an episodic model can produce more red galaxies if a minority of the blue galaxies are allowed to be passive longer .",
    "for the reddest galaxies , however , the time needed to passively evolve to such colors would approach the hubble time , so it is arguable whether such formation histories can be considered `` episodic '' .",
    "therefore , the model suggests that roughly half of the drgs to @xmath257 could participate in the episodic sfh , and thus in principle be blue sequence galaxies in a quiescent state .",
    "the rest of the drgs may have turned off star formation altogether , as suggested by analysis of the irac imaging in the hdfs , or dust obscured star formation may play a role in causing the red colors ( e.g. , labb et al . 2005 ) .",
    "recent studies of drgs indicate that half of them are detected with spitzer / mips and are forming stars at a fairly high rate while heavily obscured ( van dokkum et al .",
    "2004 , papovich et al . 2006 ,",
    "knudsen et al . 2006 , webb et al . 2006 ) .",
    "hence different mechanisms may be at work to cause the red colors .",
    "interestingly , the high detection rate with mips of drgs also suggests high duty cycles , similar to what we infer for blue galaxies .",
    "currently , we fitted only the color distribution as our sample is too small to split up in luminosity .",

    "obviously , our fields are still very small and the variations between the fields suggest that the uncertainties in the red galaxy fraction are dominated by large scale structure .",
    "future sample with very deep nir imaging will provide better estimates .",

    "on the other hand , the evolution of the slope , zeropoint , and scatter of the blue color magnitude relation is similar between the fields , indicating that field - to - field variations do not play a large role there . here",
    "the challenge is to confirm directly the cause of the relation between color and magnitude , and the cause of the blue ridge and skew to red colors of the scatter around the relation . very high",
    "signal - to - noise spectroscopy in the near infrared will be required to measure the balmer emission lines in order to estimate ages and reddening .",
    "furthermore , these studies need to be performed at higher redshifts .",
