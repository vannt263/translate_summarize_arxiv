    "according to the modern cosmology , the dark matter , corresponding to @xmath1 of the total cosmological density , is nonbaryonic and consists of new stable particles . such particles ( see e.g.@xcite for review and reference ) should be stable , saturate the measured dark matter density and decouple from plasma and radiation at least before the beginning of matter dominated stage .",
    "the easiest way to satisfy these conditions is to involve neutral elementary weakly interacting particles .",
    "however it is not the only particle physics solution for the dark matter problem and more evolved models of self - interacting dark matter are possible . in particular",
    ", new stable particles may possess new u(1 ) gauge charges and bind by coulomb - like forces in composite dark matter species .",
    "such dark atoms would look nonluminous , since they radiate invisible light of u(1 ) photons . historically mirror matter ( see@xcite for review and references ) seems to be the first example of such a nonluminous atomic dark matter .",
    "glashow s tera - helium@xcite has offered a new solution for dark atoms of dark matter .",
    "tera - u - quarks with electric charge + 2/3 formed stable ( uuu ) + 2 charged `` clusters '' that formed with two -1 charged tera - electrons e neutral [ ( uuu)ee ] tera - helium `` atoms '' that behaved like weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "the main problem for this solution was to suppress the abundance of positively charged species bound with ordinary electrons , which behave as anomalous isotopes of hydrogen or helium .",
    "this problem turned to be unresolvable@xcite , since the model@xcite predicted stable tera - electrons @xmath2 with charge -1 .",
    "as soon as primordial helium is formed in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) it captures all the free @xmath2 in positively charged @xmath3 ion , preventing any further suppression of positively charged species .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid anomalous isotopes overproduction , stable particles with charge -1 ( and corresponding antiparticles ) should be absent , so that stable negatively charged particles should have charge -2 only .",
    "elementary particle frames for heavy stable -2 charged species are provided by : ( a ) stable `` antibaryons '' @xmath4 formed by anti-@xmath5 quark of fourth generation@xcite ( b ) ac - leptons@xcite , predicted in the extension @xcite of standard model , based on the approach of almost - commutative geometry@xcite .",

    "then their positively charged antiparticles can effectively annihilate in the early universe .",
    "if new stable species belong to non - trivial representations of electroweak su(2 ) group , sphaleron transitions at high temperatures can provide the relationship between baryon asymmetry and excess of -2 charge stable species , as it was demonstrated in the case of wtc in@xcite .    after it is formed in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , @xmath8 screens the excessive @xmath0 charged particles in composite @xmath9 _ o - helium _ ( @xmath10 ) `` atoms''@xcite .    in all the considered forms of o - helium",
    ", @xmath0 behaves either as lepton or as specific `` heavy quark cluster '' with strongly suppressed hadronic interaction .",
    "therefore o - helium interaction with matter is determined by nuclear interaction of @xmath11 .",
    "these neutral primordial nuclear interacting species can play the role of a nontrivial form of strongly interacting dark matter@xcite , giving rise to a warmer than cold dark matter scenario@xcite .    here after a brief review of possible charged constituents of dark atoms , we concentrate on the properties of ohe atoms , their interaction with matter and qualitative picture of ohe cosmological evolution@xcite and observable effects .",
    "we show@xcite that interaction of ohe with nuclei in underground detectors can explain positive results of dark matter searches in dama / nai ( see for review@xcite ) and dama / libra@xcite experiments by annual modulations of radiative capture of o - helium , resolving the controversy between these results and the results of other experimental groups .",
    "glashow s tera - helium universe was first inspiring example of the composite dark matter scenario . @xmath12",
    "gauge model@xcite was aimed to explain the origin of the neutrino mass and to solve the problem of strong cp - violation in qcd .",
    "new extra @xmath13 symmetry acts on three heavy generations of tera - fermions linked with the light fermions by @xmath14 transformation .",
    "@xmath13 symmetry breaking at tev scale makes tera - fermions much heavier than their light partners .",
    "tera - fermion mass spectrum is the same as for light generations , but all the masses are scaled by the same factor of about @xmath15 .",
    "thus the masses of lightest heavy particles are in _ tera_-ev ( tev ) range , explaining their name .",
    "glashow s model@xcite takes into account that very heavy quarks @xmath16 ( or antiquarks @xmath17 ) can form bound states with other heavy quarks ( or antiquarks ) due to their coulomb - like qcd attraction , and the binding energy of these states substantially exceeds the binding energy of qcd confinement .",
    "then stable @xmath18 and @xmath19 baryons can exist .    according to@xcite primordial heavy quark @xmath5 and heavy electron @xmath20 are stable and may form a neutral @xmath21 `` atom '' with @xmath22 hadron as nucleus and two @xmath2s as `` electrons '' .",
    "the gas of such `` tera - helium atoms '' was proposed in@xcite as a candidate for a wimp - like dark matter .",
    "the problem of such scenario is an inevitable presence of `` products of incomplete combustion '' and the necessity to decrease their abundance .",
    "unfortunately , as it was shown in@xcite , this picture of tera - helium universe can not be realized .",
    "when ordinary @xmath23he is formed in big bang nucleosynthesis , it binds all the free @xmath2 into positively charged @xmath24 `` ions '' .",
    "this puts coulomb barrier for any successive @xmath25 annihilation or any effective @xmath26 binding .",
    "it removes a possibility to suppress the abundance of unwanted tera - particle species ( like @xmath27 , @xmath28 etc ) .",
    "for instance the remaining abundance of @xmath27 and @xmath29 exceeds the terrestrial upper limit for anomalous hydrogen by _ 27 orders _ of magnitude@xcite .",

    "each of them has its own antiparticle . having no other gauge charges of standard model , these particles ( ac - fermions ) behave as heavy stable leptons with charges @xmath31 and @xmath32 , called @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .    similar to the tera - helium universe",
    ", ac - lepton relics from intermediate stages of a multi - step process towards a final @xmath35 atom formation must survive in the present universe . in spite of the assumed excess of particles ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 )",
    "the abundance of relic antiparticles ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) is not negligible .",
    "there may be also a significant fraction of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which remains unbound after recombination process of these particles into @xmath35 atoms took place .",
    "as soon as @xmath8 is formed in big bang nucleosynthesis , the primordial component of free anion - like ac - leptons ( @xmath33 ) is mostly trapped in the first three minutes into a neutral o - helium atom @xmath38 .",
    "o - helium is able to capture free @xmath34 creating @xmath35 atoms and releasing @xmath8 back . in the same way the annihilation of antiparticles speeds up .",
    "@xmath34-o - helium reactions stop , when their timescale exceeds a cosmological time , leaving o - helium and @xmath34 relics in the universe .",
    "the catalytic reaction of o - helium with @xmath34 in the dense matter bodies provides successive @xmath35 binding that suppresses terrestrial anomalous isotope abundance below the experimental upper limit .",
    "due to screened charge of ac - atoms they have wimp - like interaction with the ordinary matter .",
    "such wimps are inevitably accompanied by a tiny component of nuclear interacting o - helium .",
    "the minimal walking technicolor model@xcite has two techniquarks , i.e. up @xmath5 and down @xmath39 , that transform under the adjoint representation of an @xmath30 technicolor gauge group .",
    "the six goldstone bosons @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and their corresponding antiparticles carry technibaryon number since they are made of two techniquarks or two anti - techniquarks .",
    "this means that if there is no processes violating the technibaryon number the lightest technibaryon will be stable .",
    "the electric charges of @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are given in general by @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 respectively , where @xmath44 is an arbitrary real number .",
    "the model requires in addition the existence of a fourth family of leptons , i.e. a `` new neutrino '' @xmath46 and a `` new electron '' @xmath47 .",
    "their electric charges are in terms of @xmath44 respectively @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "there are three possibilities for a scenario of dark atoms of dark matter .",
    "the first one is to have an excess of @xmath50 ( charge @xmath51 ) .",
    "the technibaryon number @xmath52 is conserved and therefore @xmath40 ( or @xmath50 ) is stable .",
    "the second possibility is to have excess of @xmath47 that also has @xmath51 charge and is stable , if @xmath47 is lighter than @xmath46 and technilepton number @xmath53 is conserved . in",
    "the both cases stable particles with @xmath51 electric charge have substantial relic densities and can capture @xmath54 nuclei to form a neutral techni - o - helium atom .",
    "finally there is a possibility to have both @xmath53 and @xmath52 conserved . in this case , the dark matter would be composed of bound atoms @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the latter case the excess of @xmath57 should be larger , than the excess of @xmath58 , so that wimp - like @xmath56 is subdominant at the dominance of nuclear interacting techni - o - helium .",
    "the technicolor and the standard model particles are in thermal equilibrium as long as the timescale of the weak ( and color ) interactions is smaller than the cosmological time .",
    "the sphalerons allow violation of @xmath52 , of baryon number @xmath59 , of lepton number @xmath60 and @xmath53 as long as the temperature of the universe exceeds the electroweak scale .",
    "it was shown in@xcite that there is a balance between the excess of techni(anti)baryons , @xmath61 , technileptons @xmath57 or of the both over the corresponding particles ( @xmath40 and/or @xmath62 ) and the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "it was also shown the there are parameters of the model , at which this asymmetry has proper sign and value , explaining the dark matter density .",
    "modern precision data on the parameters of the standard model do not exclude@xcite the existence of the 4th generation of quarks and leptons .",
    "the 4th generation follows from heterotic string phenomenology and its difference from the three known light generations can be explained by a new conserved charge , possessed only by its quarks and leptons@xcite .",
    "strict conservation of this charge makes the lightest particle of 4th family ( neutrino ) absolutely stable , but it was shown in@xcite that this neutrino can not be the dominant form of the dark matter .",
    "the same conservation law requires the lightest quark to be long living @xcite . in principle",
    "the lifetime of @xmath5 can exceed the age of the universe , if @xmath63@xcite .",
    "provided that sphaleron transitions establish excess of @xmath64 antiquarks at the observed baryon asymmetry @xmath65 can be formed and bound with @xmath8 in atom - like state of o - helium@xcite .    in the successive discussion of ohe dark matter",
    "we generally do nt specify the type of @xmath51 charged particle , denoting it as @xmath0 .",
    "the structure of ohe atom follows from the general analysis of the bound states of @xmath0 with nuclei .    consider a simple model@xcite , in which the nucleus is regarded as a sphere with uniform charge density and in which the mass of the @xmath0 is assumed to be much larger than that of the nucleus .",
    "spin dependence is also not taken into account so that both the particle and nucleus are considered as scalars .",
    "then the hamiltonian is given by @xmath66 for short distances @xmath67 and @xmath68 for long distances @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fine structure constant , @xmath71 is the nuclear radius , @xmath72 is the electric charge of nucleus and @xmath73 is the electric charge of negatively charged particle @xmath74 . since @xmath75 the reduced mass is @xmath76 .    for small nuclei",
    "the coulomb binding energy is like in hydrogen atom and is given by @xmath77    for large nuclei @xmath74 is inside nuclear radius and the harmonic oscillator approximation is valid for the estimation of the binding energy @xmath78    for the intermediate regions between these two cases with the use of trial function of the form @xmath79 variational treatment of the problem@xcite gives @xmath80 where the function @xmath81 has limits @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 . for @xmath85",
    "the coulomb model gives a good approximation , while at @xmath86 the harmonic oscillator approximation is appropriate .    in the case of ohe @xmath87 ,",
    "what proves its bohr - atom - like structure , assumed in@xcite . the radius of bohr orbit in these  atoms \" @xcite @xmath88",
    "however , the size of he nucleus , rotating around @xmath0 in this bohr atom , turns out to be of the order and even a bit larger than the radius @xmath89 of its bohr orbit , and the corresponding correction to the binding energy due to non - point - like charge distribution in he is significant .",
    "bohr atom like structure of ohe seems to provide a possibility to use the results of atomic physics for description of ohe interaction with matter .",
    "however , the situation is much more complicated .",
    "ohe atom is similar to the hydrogen , in which electron is hundreds times heavier , than proton , so that it is proton shell that surrounds `` electron nucleus '' .",
    "nuclei that interact with such `` hydrogen '' would interact first with strongly interacting `` protonic '' shell and such interaction can hardly be treated in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "moreover in the description of ohe interaction the account for the finite size of he , which is even larger than the radius of bohr orbit , is important .",
    "one should consider , therefore , the analysis , presented below , as only a first step approaching true nuclear physics of ohe .",
    "the approach of@xcite assumes the following picture of ohe interaction with nuclei : ohe is a neutral atom in the ground state , perturbed by coulomb and nuclear forces of the approaching nucleus .",
    "the sign of ohe polarization changes with the distance : at larger distances stark - like effect takes place - nuclear coulomb force polarizes ohe so that nucleus is attracted by the induced dipole moment of ohe , while as soon as the perturbation by nuclear force starts to dominate the nucleus polarizes ohe in the opposite way so that he is situated more close to the nucleus , resulting in the repulsive effect of the helium shell of ohe .",
    "when helium is completely merged with the nucleus the interaction is reduced to the oscillatory potential of @xmath0 with homogeneously charged merged nucleus with the charge @xmath90 .",
    "therefore ohe - nucleus potential has qualitative feature , presented on fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] : the potential well @xmath91 at large distances ( regions iii - iv ) is changed by a potential wall @xmath92 in region ii . the existence of this potential barrier causes suppression of reactions with transition of ohe - nucleus system to levels in the potential well @xmath93 of the region i. it results in the dominance of elastic scattering while transitions to levels in the shallow well ( regions iii - iv ) should dominate in reactions of ohe - nucleus capture .    on the other hand ,",
    "o - helium , being an @xmath70-particle with screened electric charge , can catalyze nuclear transformations , which can influence primordial light element abundance and cause primordial heavy element formation .",
    "it is especially important for quantitative estimation of role of ohe in big bang nucleosynthesis and in stellar evolution .",
    "these effects need a special detailed and complicated study and this work is under way .",
    "our first steps in the approach to ohe nuclear physics seem to support the qualitative picture of ohe cosmological evolution described in@xcite and based on the dominant role of elastic collisions in ohe interaction with baryonic matter .",
    "due to elastic nuclear interactions of its helium constituent with nuclei in the cosmic plasma , the o - helium gas is in thermal equilibrium with plasma and radiation on the radiation dominance ( rd ) stage , while the energy and momentum transfer from plasma is effective .",
    "the radiation pressure acting on the plasma is then transferred to density fluctuations of the o - helium gas and transforms them in acoustic waves at scales up to the size of the horizon .    at temperature",
    "@xmath94 the energy and momentum transfer from baryons to o - helium is not effective @xcite because @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the mass of the @xmath10 atom and @xmath97 . here _",

    "it can provide some suppression of small scale structure in the considered model for all reasonable masses of o - helium .",
    "the significance of this suppression and its effect on the structure formation needs a special study in detailed numerical simulations . in any case , it can not be as strong as the free streaming suppression in ordinary warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenarios , but one can expect that qualitatively we deal with warmer than cold dark matter model .    at temperature @xmath118 the energy and momentum transfer from baryons to o - helium is not effective@xcite and o - helium gas decouples from plasma .",

    "being decoupled from baryonic matter , the @xmath10 gas does not follow the formation of baryonic astrophysical objects ( stars , planets , molecular clouds ... ) and forms dark matter halos of galaxies .",
    "it can be easily seen that o - helium gas is collisionless for its number density , saturating galactic dark matter . taking the average density of baryonic",
    "matter one can also find that the galaxy as a whole is transparent for o - helium in spite of its nuclear interaction .",
    "only individual baryonic objects like stars and planets are opaque for it .",
    "o - helium atoms can be destroyed in astrophysical processes , giving rise to acceleration of free @xmath0 in the galaxy .",
    "o - helium can be ionized due to nuclear interaction with cosmic rays@xcite .",
    "estimations@xcite show that for the number density of cosmic rays @xmath119 during the age of galaxy a fraction of about @xmath120 of total amount of ohe is disrupted irreversibly , since the inverse effect of recombination of free @xmath0 is negligible . near the solar system it leads to concentration of free @xmath0 @xmath121 after ohe destruction free @xmath0 have momentum of order @xmath122 and velocity @xmath123 and due to effect of solar modulation these particles initially can hardly reach earth@xcite .",

    "these ohe atoms are disrupted in collisions with particles in the front of shock wave and acceleration of free @xmath0 by regular mechanism gives the corresponding fraction in cosmic rays .",
    "however , this picture needs detailed analysis , based on the development of ohe nuclear physics and numerical studies of ohe evolution in the stellar matter .",

    "it should be noted that the nuclear cross section of the o - helium interaction with matter escapes the severe constraints@xcite on strongly interacting dark matter particles ( simps)@xcite imposed by the xqc experiment@xcite .",
    "therefore , a special strategy of direct o - helium search is needed , as it was proposed in@xcite .",
    "the evident consequence of the o - helium dark matter is its inevitable presence in the terrestrial matter , which appears opaque to o - helium and stores all its in - falling flux .",

    "kev and absence of such effect at energies above 6 kev means that binding energy @xmath170 of na - ohe system in dama experiment should not exceed 6 kev , being in the range 2 - 4 kev .",

    "then the rate of ohe radiative capture in cryogenic detectors is given by eq.([radcap ] ) , in which room temperature @xmath168 is multiplied by factor @xmath174 .",
    "note that in the case of @xmath175 in cogent experiment relative velocity is determined by the thermal velocity of germanium nuclei , what leads to enhancement relative to cryogenic germanium detectors .",
    "the existence of heavy stable particles is one of the popular solutions for the dark matter problem .",
    "usually they are considered to be electrically neutral . but potentially dark matter can be formed by stable heavy charged particles bound in neutral atom - like states by coulomb attraction .",
    "analysis of the cosmological data and atomic composition of the universe gives the constrains on the particle charge showing that only @xmath51 charged constituents , being trapped by primordial helium in neutral o - helium states , can avoid the problem of overproduction of the anomalous isotopes of chemical elements , which are severely constrained by observations .",
    "cosmological model of o - helium dark matter can even explain puzzles of direct dark matter searches .",
    "the proposed explanation is based on the mechanism of low energy binding of ohe with nuclei . within the uncertainty of nuclear physics parameters",
    "there exists a range at which ohe binding energy with sodium is in the interval 2 - 4 kev .",
    "annual modulation in radiative capture of ohe to this bound state leads to the corresponding energy release observed as an ionization signal in dama / nai and dama / libra experiments .    with the account for high sensitivity of the numerical results to the values of nuclear parameters and for the approximations , made in the calculations ,",
    "the presented results can be considered only as an illustration of the possibility to explain puzzles of dark matter search in the framework of composite dark matter scenario .",
    "an interesting feature of this explanation is a conclusion that the ionization signal may be absent in detectors containing light ( e.g. @xmath176 ) or heavy ( e.g. xe ) elements",
    ". therefore test of results of dama / nai and dama / libra experiments by other experimental groups can become a very nontrivial task .",
    "recent indications to positive result in the matter of cresst detector@xcite , in which ohe binding is expected together with absence of signal in xenon detector@xcite , may qualitatively favor the presented approach . for the same chemical content",
    "an order of magnitude suppression in cryogenic detectors can explain why indications to positive effect in cogent experiment@xcite can be compatible with the constraints of cdms experiment .",
    "an inevitable consequence of the proposed explanation is appearance in the matter of underground detectors anomalous superheavy isotopes , having the mass roughly by @xmath96 larger , than ordinary isotopes of the corresponding elements .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the framework of the presented approach positive result of experimental search for wimps by effect of their nuclear recoil would be a signature for a multicomponent nature of dark matter .",
    "such ohe+wimps multicomponent dark matter scenarios naturally follow from ac model @xcite and can be realized in models of walking technicolor @xcite .",
    "stable @xmath51 charge states ( @xmath0 ) can be elementary like ac - leptons or technileptons , or look like technibaryons .",
    "the latter , composed of techniquarks , reveal their structure at much higher energy scale and should be produced at lhc as elementary species .",
    "the signature for ac leptons and techniparticles is unique and distinctive what allows to separate them from other hypothetical exotic particles .",
    "since simultaneous production of three @xmath177 pairs and their conversion in two doubly charged quark clusters @xmath178 is suppressed , the only possibility to test the models of composite dark matter from 4th generation in the collider experiments is a search for production of stable hadrons containing single @xmath5 or @xmath64 like @xmath179 and @xmath180/@xmath181 .",
    "the presented approach sheds new light on the physical nature of dark matter .",
    "specific properties of dark atoms and their constituents contain distinct features , by which they can be distinguished from other recent approaches to this problem@xcite , and are challenging for the experimental search .",
    "the development of quantitative description of ohe interaction with matter confronted with the experimental data will provide the complete test of the composite dark matter model .",
    "it challenges search for stable double charged particles at accelerators and cosmic rays as direct experimental probe for charged constituents of dark atoms of dark matter .",
