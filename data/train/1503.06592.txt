    "the isoperimetric problem in @xmath0 with density is a classical problem , which has received much attention in the last decade .",
    "the idea is quite simple : given a l.s.c .",
    "function @xmath4 , usually called `` density '' , for any set @xmath5 we define the volume @xmath6 and the perimeter @xmath7 as @xmath8 where the subscript reminds the fact that volume and perimeter are done with respect to @xmath9 , and where @xmath10 is the reduced boundary of @xmath11 ( to read this paper there is no need to know what the reduced boundary is , since under our assumptions this will always coincide with the usual topological boundary @xmath12 ) .",
    "the literature on this problem is huge , a short and incomplete list is  @xcite ) .",
    "the main questions about the isoperimetric problem with density are of course the existence and regularity of isoperimetric sets ; concerning the existence , now a lot is known ( see for instance  @xcite ) . since in this paper we are dealing with the regularity , let us briefly recall the main known results .",
    "the first , very important one , can be found in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3.5 and corollary  3.8 ) ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "[ veryold ] let @xmath9 be a @xmath13 density on @xmath0 , with @xmath14 .",
    "then the boundary of any isoperimetric set is @xmath15 , except for a singular set of hausdorff dimension at most @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath9 is just lipschitz and @xmath1 , then the boundary is of class @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to point out that the above result requires at least a @xmath18 regularity for @xmath9 ( or lipschitz in the @xmath19-dimensional case ) .",
    "the reason is rather simple : namely , most of the standard techniques to get the regularity make sense only if @xmath9 is at least lipschitz ( for a discussion on this fact , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) ) .",
    "in particular , the following observation can be particularly insightful . in order to get regularity of an isoperimetric set @xmath11 ,",
    "a standard idea is to build some `` competitor '' @xmath20 , which behaves better than @xmath11 where the boundary of @xmath11 is not regular enough ; however , in order to get some contradiction , we must ensure that @xmath20 has the same volume as @xmath11 , since otherwise the isoperimetric property of @xmath11 can not be used . on the other hand",
    ", it can be complicate to build the set @xmath20 taking its volume into account , since while defining @xmath20 one is interested in its perimeter . as a consequence",
    ", it is extremely useful to have the so - called `` @xmath21 property '' , which roughly speaking says the following : it is always possible to modify the volume of a set @xmath20 of a small quantity @xmath22 , increasing its perimeter of at most @xmath23 for some fixed constant @xmath24 ; if this is the case , one can then `` adjust '' the volume of @xmath20 so that it coincides with the one of @xmath11 .",
    "this property was already discussed by allard , almgren and bombieri since the 1970 s ( see for instance  @xcite ) , and it has been widely used in most of the papers about the regularity in this context since then .",
    "unfortunately , while the @xmath21 property is rather simple to establish when @xmath9 is at least lipschitz , it is false if @xmath9 is not lipschitz .    to get anyhow some regularity for the isoperimetric sets in case of low regularity of @xmath9 , in the recent paper  @xcite we have introduced and proved a weaker property , called the `` @xmath25 property '' , which basically says that the volume of a set can be modified of @xmath22 , increasing the perimeter of at most @xmath26 .",
    "since we will use this property in the present paper , we give here the result ( the actual result proved in  @xcite is more general , but we prefer to claim here the simpler version that we are going to need ) .",
    "[ oldepsepsbeta ] let @xmath27 be a set of locally finite perimeter , and @xmath9 an @xmath28-hlder density for some @xmath29 .",
    "then , for every ball @xmath30 with nonempty intersection with @xmath10 , there exist two constants @xmath31 such that , for every @xmath32 , there is a set @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 where @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 so for @xmath1 it is @xmath37 .    by using the classical regularity results ( see for instance  @xcite ) , and modifying the arguments in order to make use of the @xmath25 property instead of the @xmath21 one ( which is false ) , we then obtained the following regularity result ( see  @xcite for a definition of porosity ) .",
    "[ old ] let @xmath11 be an isoperimetric set in @xmath0 with a density @xmath38 , with @xmath29",
    ". then @xmath39 is of class @xmath40 . in particular , if @xmath1 then @xmath12 is @xmath41 . if @xmath9 is only bounded above and below , then it is still true that @xmath39 , and moreover @xmath11 is porous .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the following stronger regularity result for the bi - dimensional case .",
    "it is worthy observing that the regularity obtained above is still less than the @xmath18 regularity that one could expect just by looking at theorem  [ veryold ] , but it is better than the previously known regularity given by theorem  [ old ] . in particular , notice that there is a substantial improvement between @xmath42 and @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , the second exponent is not just merely bigger than the first one , there is also a much deeper difference : namely , when @xmath28 goes to @xmath43 , the first exponent goes to @xmath44 , while the second goes to @xmath43 . in particular",
    ", our theorem   gives also a proof that for @xmath9 lipschitz an isoperimetric set is @xmath17 , as stated in theorem  [ veryold ] .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a couple of remarks .",
    "first of all , the fact that the regularity of the `` old '' theorem  [ old ] does never exceed @xmath45 is not strange , since this is the best regularity that can be obtained via the classical methods , not really using the ( non - local ) isoperimetric property of a set @xmath11 , but only the weaker ( local ) fact that @xmath11 is an @xmath46-minimizer of the perimeter . to get anything better than @xmath45 , one has really to use the non - locality of the fact that @xmath11 is an isoperimetric set , as we do in the present paper by using the non - local @xmath25 property .",
    "the second remark is about the sharp regularity exponent that one can obtain for an isoperimetric set with a @xmath2 density : we do not believe that our exponent of theorem   is sharp , but we are also not sure whether it is possible to reach the @xmath18 regularity , similarly to what happens for @xmath14 in the classical case .",
    "let us briefly present the notation of the present paper .",
    "the density will always be denoted by @xmath47 ; keep in mind that , since we want to prove theorem  , the function @xmath9 will always be at least continuous .",
    "for any set @xmath48 , we call @xmath6 and @xmath7 its volume and perimeter . for any @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we call @xmath51 the ball centered at @xmath52 with radius @xmath53 . given two points @xmath54 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath55 , and @xmath56 the segment connecting the two points , its euclidean length , and its length with respect to the density @xmath9 ( that is , @xmath57 ) .",
    "given three points @xmath58 , we will denote by @xmath59 the angle between the segments @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "let now @xmath48 be an isoperimetric set ; then , by theorem  [ old ] we already know that the boundary of @xmath11 is of class @xmath42 , hence in particular it is locally lipschitz . as a consequence , for any two points @xmath62 which belong to the same connected component of @xmath12 and which are very close to each other ( with respect to the diameter of this connected component ) ,",
    "the shortest curve in @xmath12 connecting @xmath63 and @xmath64 is well - defined .",
    "we denote by @xmath65 this curve , and again by @xmath66 and @xmath67 we denote its euclidean length , and its length with respect to the density @xmath9 .",
    "the letter @xmath24 is always used to denote a large constant , which can increase from line to line , while @xmath68 is a fixed constant , coming from the @xmath28-hlder property .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of our main result , theorem  .",
    "most of the proof consists in studying the situation around few given points , so let us fix some useful particular notation ; figure  [ figure ] helps with the names of the points .",
    "let us fix an isoperimetric set @xmath11 and a point @xmath52 on @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath69 be a very small constant , much smaller than the length of the connected component @xmath70 containing @xmath52 , and of the distance between @xmath52 and the other connected components of @xmath12 ( if any ) . since we know that @xmath71 is a @xmath41 curve , we can fix arbitrarily an orientation on it ; hence , let us define four points @xmath72 in @xmath73 as follows : among the points of @xmath71 which belong to @xmath73 and which are _ before _",
    "@xmath52 , we call @xmath74 the closest one to @xmath52 , and @xmath63 the farthest one ( in the sense of the paremeterization of @xmath71 ) .",
    "we define analogously @xmath75 and @xmath64 _ after _ @xmath52 : of course , @xmath74 and @xmath63 may coincide , as well as @xmath64 and @xmath75 . moreover , we call @xmath76 the angle @xmath77 , and @xmath78 finally , we introduce the following set @xmath20 , which we will use as a competitor to @xmath11 ( after adjusting its area ) .",
    "it is to be noticed that the above definition makes sense : indeed , by  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.1 ) we already know that @xmath11 is bounded , and by construction the segment @xmath81 can not intersect any point of @xmath82 . in particular , all the connected components of @xmath11 whose boundary is not @xmath71 belong also to @xmath20 ; instead , the connected component of @xmath11 with @xmath71 as boundary has been slightly changed near @xmath52 . recalling that @xmath9 is real - valued and strictly positive , as well as @xmath28-hlder , we can find a constant @xmath68 such that @xmath83 for every @xmath84 in some neighborhood of @xmath11 , containing all the points that we are going to use in our argument : this is not a problem , since all our arguments will be local .",
    "let us now give the first easy estimates about the above quantities .",
    "first of all , let us consider a point @xmath87 in the symmetric difference between @xmath11 and @xmath20 ; by construction , either @xmath88 belongs to the ball @xmath51 , or it has a distance at most @xmath89 from that ball . as a consequence , @xmath88 has distance at most @xmath90 from @xmath52 , and this gives @xmath91 to the set @xmath11 , with a ball @xmath30 intersecting @xmath12 far away from the point @xmath52 .",
    "we get a constant @xmath92 and of course , up to have taken @xmath53 small enough , we can assume that @xmath93 , being @xmath94 .",
    "then , theorem  [ oldepsepsbeta ] provides us with a set @xmath33 satisfying  ( [ propepepbe ] ) ; as a consequence , if we define @xmath95 , we get @xmath96 , and then , since @xmath11 is isoperimetric , by  ( [ put0 ] ) we get @xmath97 which implies @xmath98 let us now evaluate the term @xmath99 : if we call @xmath100 and @xmath101 the minimum and the maximum of @xmath9 inside @xmath102 , by  ( [ genass ] ) we have @xmath103 and then @xmath104 inserting this estimate in  ( [ put1 ] ) , we get then @xmath105 since @xmath106 we immediately derive first that @xmath76 is very small , so that @xmath107 , and then @xmath108 this gives the validity of both the inequalities in  ( [ easyfirst ] ) . finally , ( [ put1 ] ) together with  ( [ easyfirst ] ) and the fact that , since @xmath109 , one has @xmath110 , gives  ( [ esticirc ] ) .",
    "let @xmath113 be a point such that @xmath114 , and let us call @xmath115 and @xmath75 as before .",
    "of course , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , so that @xmath118 . since by  ( [ easyfirst ] ) we have @xmath119 , we get @xmath120 and @xmath121 , as well as @xmath122 . hence , ( [ esticirc ] ) gives us @xmath123 and then the first estimate in  ( [ esticirca ] ) is established .",
    "the second one immediately follows , just thanks to the continuity of @xmath9 .",
    "let us call @xmath126 the maximal distance between points of the arc @xmath127 and the segment @xmath128 , and let us denote @xmath129 for brevity .",
    "of course , concerning the euclidean distances , one has @xmath130 on the other hand , let us call @xmath131 the projection of @xmath132 on the line containing the segment @xmath128 , so that for every @xmath133 one has @xmath134 by definition ; moreover , define the density @xmath135 as @xmath136 , so that by the @xmath28-hlder property  ( [ genass ] ) of @xmath9 we get @xmath137 for every @xmath133 .",
    "since @xmath138 for every @xmath139 , by  ( [ esteuc ] ) and  ( [ genass ] ) we can then easily evaluate @xmath140 on the other hand , by  ( [ est2 ] ) and by  ( [ esticirca ] ) we have also @xmath141 putting together the last two estimates , we obtain then @xmath142 as a consequence , we can assume that @xmath143 , since otherwise we readily get @xmath144 , and in this case of course  ( [ toprove ] ) holds .",
    "therefore , the last inequality can be rewritten as @xmath145 there are then two cases : if the term between parenthesis is positive , then again  ( [ toprove ] ) clearly holds .",
    "if , instead , it is negative , this implies @xmath146 and then  ( [ finhe ] ) gives @xmath147 which is  ( [ toprove ] ) .",
    "we can now show a more refined estimate for @xmath148 , which takes into account the maximal angle of deviation of the curve @xmath149 with respect to the segment @xmath150 .",
    "let us be more precise : for every @xmath151 we define @xmath152 the projection of @xmath153 on the line containing @xmath150 .",
    "moreover , we call @xmath154 the angle @xmath155 if @xmath156 is closer to @xmath88 than to @xmath157 , and @xmath158 otherwise , and we let @xmath159 be the maximum among all the angles @xmath160 for @xmath161 : figure  [ figure2 ] depicts the situation",
    ".      let us fix a point @xmath161 such that @xmath165 , and let assume without loss of generality that @xmath166 , as in figure  [ figure2 ] .",
    "we can then apply lemma  [ applynow ] , first with @xmath167 , and then with @xmath168 , to get , also keeping in mind  ( [ esticirca ] ) , that @xmath169 we have now to compare the lengths of the segments @xmath170 and @xmath171 with those of the segments @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "we can again argue defining the density @xmath174 as @xmath136 , being @xmath131 the projection on the line containing the segment @xmath150 : then @xmath175 and the analogous estimate of course works for @xmath176 . putting them together , and recalling that @xmath177 , with strict inequality if @xmath156 is outside @xmath150 , we obtain @xmath178 where we have again used that @xmath179 , which comes as usual by  ( [ esticirca ] ) . putting this estimate together with  ( [ lecce1 ] ) , we get @xmath180 now , notice that @xmath181 as a consequence , ( [ lecce2 ] ) implies the validity of both the cases in  ( [ 2poss ] ) , up to have chosen a sufficiently large constant @xmath182 .    we are now ready to find a first result about the behaviour of the direction of the chords connecting points of the curve @xmath71 .",
    "indeed , putting together lemma  [ lecce ] and lemma  [ generic ] , we get the next estimate .    [ 2.6 ] let @xmath183 be two points in @xmath71 sufficiently close to each other , call @xmath184 , and let @xmath185 be a point closer to @xmath186 than to @xmath52 .",
    "then , there is @xmath182 such that @xmath187    having a point @xmath188 and some @xmath50 very small , we can define the points @xmath189 as for lemma  [ generic ] , and by symmetry we can think @xmath190 .",
    "we apply now twice lemma  [ lecce ] , once with @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and once with @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "we have then the validity of  ( [ 2poss ] ) for the two angles @xmath195 and @xmath196 ; we claim that @xmath197 let us first see that this estimate implies the thesis .",
    "if the point @xmath153 is closer to @xmath63 than to @xmath52 , then by definition and by  ( [ finlem ] ) @xmath198 as a consequence , by  ( [ easyfirst ] ) we have @xmath199 and the thesis is obtained .",
    "suppose , instead , that @xmath153 is closer to @xmath52 than to @xmath63 ; since by assumption it is anyhow closer to @xmath186 than to @xmath52 , and @xmath200 by  ( [ easyfirst ] ) , again using  ( [ finlem ] ) we have @xmath201 then the very same argument as in  ( [ torepeat ] ) shows again the thesis .",
    "summarizing , we have proved that  ( [ finlem ] ) implies the thesis , and hence to conclude we only have to show the validity of  ( [ finlem ] ) .",
    "we argue as in lemma  [ generic ] , defining the competitor set @xmath20 which has @xmath202 as boundary .",
    "notice that this is very similar to what we did in definition  [ deff ] , the only difference being that we are putting the two segments @xmath203 and @xmath204 instead of the segment @xmath81 .",
    "the very same argument that we presented after definition  [ deff ] still ensures that the set @xmath20 is well defined . as in lemma",
    "[ generic ] , then , we have now to evaluate @xmath205 and @xmath206 . concerning the first quantity , we can get an estimate which is much better than  ( [ put0 ] ) , thanks to the definition of @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "the curve @xmath207 is composed by two pieces ; concerning the first part , @xmath208 , by definition this remains within a distance of at most @xmath209 from @xmath63 .",
    "the second part , @xmath210 , is contained in the shaded region of figure  [ figure3 ] , which is the intersection between the ball @xmath51 and the region of the points @xmath153 such that @xmath211 . repeating the same argument with @xmath212 and @xmath75 , and recalling that @xmath213 , we have @xmath214 let us now observe that by  ( [ easyfirst ] ) one has @xmath215 , and then @xmath216 there are then two possibilities : either @xmath217 , so we already have the validity of  ( [ finlem ] ) and the proof is concluded , or @xmath218 , and then the last two estimates imply @xmath219 therefore , using theorem  [ oldepsepsbeta ] exactly as in the proof of lemma  [ generic ] , we find a set @xmath220 having the same volume as @xmath11 ( and then more perimeter ) satisfying @xmath221 from which we directly get @xmath222 we now use the fact that  ( [ 2poss ] ) is valid both with @xmath195 and with @xmath196 , as pointed out before .",
    "one has to distinguish three possible cases .",
    "suppose now that both @xmath195 and @xmath196 are bigger than @xmath224 .",
    "in this case , ( [ 2poss ] ) gives @xmath225 which together with  ( [ qufi ] ) gives @xmath226 which is equivalent to  ( [ finlem ] ) , and then also in this case the proof is completed .    finally , we have to consider what happens when only one between @xmath195 and @xmath196 is bigger than @xmath224 ; just to fix the ideas , we can suppose that @xmath227 , hence in particular @xmath228 .",
    "applying then  ( [ 2poss ] ) , this time we find @xmath229 where the last inequality is true precisely because @xmath230 .",
    "exactly as before , putting this estimate together with  ( [ qufi ] ) implies  ( [ finlem ] ) , and then also in the last possible case we obtained the proof .",
    "let @xmath11 be an isoperimetric set for the @xmath2 density @xmath9 .",
    "to show that @xmath12 is of class @xmath3 , let us select two generic points @xmath231 such that @xmath232 .",
    "we want to show that @xmath233 as this readily imply the thesis . indeed , suppose that  ( [ mainmain ] ) has been established , and call @xmath234 the direction of the segment @xmath235 ; since we already know that @xmath12 is of class @xmath236 by theorem  [ old ] , considering points @xmath185 which converge to @xmath52 we deduce by  ( [ mainmain ] ) that @xmath237 , where @xmath238 is the tangent vector of @xmath12 at @xmath52 . since the situation of @xmath186 and of @xmath52 is perfectly symmetric , the same argument also shows that @xmath239 , thus by triangual inequality we have found @xmath240 since @xmath186 and @xmath52 are two generic points having distance @xmath53 , and since @xmath24 only depends on @xmath68 and on @xmath28 , this estimate shows that @xmath12 is of class @xmath241 ; therefore , the proof will be concluded once we show  ( [ mainmain ] ) .",
    "notice that  ( [ mainmain ] ) simply says that the estimate of lemma  [ 2.6 ] holds also without asking to the point @xmath153 to be closer to @xmath186 than to @xmath52 .    to do so ,",
    "let us recall that by  ( [ esticirca ] ) it is @xmath242 , let us write @xmath243 , and let us define recursively the sequence @xmath244 by letting @xmath245 be the point such that @xmath246 observe that @xmath244 is a sequence inside the curve @xmath247 , which converges to @xmath52 , and moreover for every @xmath248 one has @xmath249 let us now take a point @xmath250 ; again recalling  ( [ esticirca ] ) , by the definition of the points @xmath244 it is obvious that @xmath153 is closer to @xmath244 than to @xmath52 ; as a consequence , lemma  [ 2.6 ] applied to @xmath244 and @xmath52 ensures that @xmath251 where we have also used  ( [ stle ] ) , and where @xmath252 . keeping in mind the obvious fact that @xmath253 for every @xmath254 , and then the above estimate is valid in particular for the point @xmath255 , we deduce that for the generic @xmath250 it is @xmath256 where the last inequality is true because @xmath257 .",
