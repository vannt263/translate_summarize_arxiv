    "the primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , which are thought to be formed from density fluctuations during the radiation - dominated era of the early universe @xcite ( for other mechanisms , see also @xcite ) , have long been a useful tool to investigate the early universe itself owing to their radiative nature discovered by hawking @xcite .",
    "a cosmological model under investigation in this paper is the so - called rs2 braneworld suggested by randall and sundrum . in their scenario , our universe is a 4d lorentz metric hypersurface called _ brane _ , embedded in a @xmath1 symmetric 5d anti  de sitter ( ads ) spacetime called _ bulk _ @xcite .",
    "rs2 assumes that the number of branes is only one and its tension is positive .",
    "the bulk has a typical length scale that originates from ads curvature radius , @xmath2 , which draws a short distance boundary on the brane ; 4d newton law is recovered as far as we consider a sufficiently larger scale than @xmath2 , while deviation from ordinary gravity appears below it @xcite .",
    "the present table - top upper bound on the bulk ads radius @xmath2 was obtained by measuring short - distance gravitational force as @xmath3 @xcite . from such a point of view , pbhs again retain their status .",
    "actually , in the framework of the braneworld , it has been revealed that the nature of black holes with small masses highly differs from the ordinary 4d one .",
    "in particular small black holes with schwarzschild radius @xmath4 behave as essentially 5d objects and their radii are significantly stretched compared with 4d bhs @xcite .",
    "it means that the temperature of hawking radiation drops down .",
    "we naturally expect that even such small black holes were produced by gravitational collapse in the early universe @xcite ( there have been discussions on the black hole formation in respect of the particle scattering processes even in the early universe @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have to revisit the particle production by primordial black holes taking into account how non-4d character modifies it .",
    "in addition , the rs2 scenario implies a nonstandard high - energy regime before the standard radiation - dominated era @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it was recently argued by guedens , clancy , and liddle and majumdar @xcite that through the brane high - energy phase accretion of surrounding radiation onto pbhs is so efficient that they grow in their masses on the contrary to the standard scenario .",
    "actually it was already revealed that the high - energy diffuse photon background is highly modified in the braneworld @xcite , and it can in turn constrains braneworld according to the amount of pbhs @xcite .",
    "even in other various contexts , braneworld pbhs are gradually extending their status @xcite .",
    "we extend above - mentioned strategy in this paper by incorporating cosmic - ray antiproton observations .",
    "because pbhs are thought to be emitting both particles and antiparticles without any distinction , we can search for dark matter pbhs with the aid of antimatter detectors .",
    "in fact , one of the most precisely measured is antiproton among various antimatter species in cosmic rays .",
    "high - precision measurements of antiprotons around gev have been successively performed since mid-1990s by several collaborations such as balloon - borne experiment with a superconducting spectrometer ( bess ) @xcite , isotope matter antimatter experiment ( imax ) @xcite , cosmic antiparticle ring imaging cerenkov experiment ( caprice ) @xcite , and so on .",
    "there are even observations in high energy regions over @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it is known that antiprotons can set nearly the same constraint on the pbh abundance as the diffuse gamma - ray in the 4d case @xcite . therefore in this paper",
    ", we examine antiproton emission from braneworld pbhs and see the spectral shape of the antiproton flux .",
    "combined with the observational data , they give quantitative constraints on the amount of pbhs and , in the context of the braneworld , in turn set bounds on the ads curvature radius @xmath2 .    for propagation of cosmic - ray antiprotons in the galaxy ,",
    "we take a recent version of the diffusion model @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", the effect of the solar wind is crucial for the sub - gev antiproton flux .",
    "although such a effect , called solar modulation , has been under successive measurement , there remains a difficulty in incorporating it into the model .",
    "hence we wish to use data as little affected by the solar activity as possible , therefore choose bess @xcite and caprice @xcite , which were taken during the recent solar minimum .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows .",
    "first we briefly review in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] the cosmology and behavior of evaporating black holes in the rs2 braneworld . in sec .",

    "hereafter we basically use 4d natural units @xmath6 throughout this paper . newton s gravitational constant",
    "is also taken to be unity and we define 4d planck mass as @xmath7 . in these units , other 4d planck - scale quantities , defined as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , are also all unity , whereas they will usually appear in expressions to clarify their differences from higher dimensional fundamental scales .",
    "a subscript `` 5 '' expresses five - dimensional quantity , such as 5d planck mass @xmath11 , and so on .",
    "we start with the five - dimensional einstein equation @xmath12 where the energy - momentum tensor is expressed in the gaussian normal coordinates as @xcite @xmath13 with the metric on the brane @xmath14 .",

    "the energy conservation law is the same form as the 4d one : @xmath26 for complete derivation of the effective friedmann equations , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .    as for the dark radiation term",
    ", it was argued that this quantity must be sufficiently smaller than ordinary radiation at the time of nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "thus we can simply drop this term . additionally , based on wmap observation @xcite",
    ", we can set @xmath27 and require @xmath28 to be extremely small . using the definition of the ads curvature radius @xmath29",
    ", we obtain the relation between the geometrical scale and the brane tension : @xmath30 therefore a following simple relation between the five - dimensional and four - dimensional planck mass holds : @xmath31    as a result , the friedmann eq .",
    "( [ eq : brane.friedmann.formal ] ) becomes @xmath32 this expression differs from the ordinary 4d one with respect to the existence of a _",
    "@xmath23-square _ term .",
    "this term is only relevant when the radiation energy is sufficiently denser than the brane tension , namely in the earliest era of the universe .",
    "then we immediately understand that the cosmological evolution in the early universe is split into two phases ; the earlier one is the nonstandard high - energy regime in which evolution of the scale factor @xmath33 obeys @xmath34 , and the latter is the standard radiation - dominated universe , with @xmath35 . the former is often called the _ @xmath23-square _ phase .    in order to obtain whole profile of the scale factor , wmap data , such as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , are used .",
    "the time of matter - radiation equality @xmath41 is calculated to be @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "there is the analytic solution through the whole radiation - dominated era : @xmath43 where we denoted the time when transition occurs as @xmath44 .",

    "we explicitly write down the asymptotic expressions for cosmological quantities in the early universe for later use : @xmath52      in the braneworld scenario ,",
    "a massive object localized on the brane within typical length scale much shorter than @xmath53 should see the background space - time as an effectively flat 5d minkowski space @xcite ( for possible deviations and other exotic features , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore a sufficiently small black hole is no longer ordinary 4d one , but is approximately described as 5d solution . ] .",
    "if that black hole has no charge and is not rotating , the solution must be 5d schwarzschild . in terms of asymptotically flat spherical coordinates , the 5d schwarzschild metric",
    "is written down @xcite and its 4d projection is @xmath54 with @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the 5d schwarzschild radius and @xmath57 is the line element on unit @xmath58-sphere . in our framework",
    "the schwarzschild radius in the five - dimensional spacetime is related to the black hole mass @xmath59 and five - dimensional fundamental mass scale @xmath11 as @xcite @xmath60 while in the ordinary 4d case @xmath61 . on the other hand , the hawking temperature of a schwarzschild black hole",
    "is determined by space - time periodicity in the direction of imaginary time . for a higher - dimensional schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "the temperature is given in terms of its radius as @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "thus the five - dimensional hawking temperature is @xmath63 while in the 4d case @xmath64 .",
    "it has been argued that in the early universe primordial black holes are formed due to gravitational collapse caused by density perturbation @xcite .",
    "we here simplify the situation ; when a superhorizon - scale density perturbation with adequate amplitude enters the hubble horizon at @xmath65 , it instantaneously collapses into a black hole with some fraction of the horizon mass .",
    "hence the initial mass of a pbh denoted @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 where the @xmath68 parameter @xmath69 expresses above mentioned fraction @xcite .",

    "matter field localized on the brane sees a black hole as an approximately disk - shaped object with the effective schwarzschild radius @xcite @xmath73 for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",

    ", we are forced to treat @xmath81 as a free parameter throughout discussions .",
    "a significant point is here . in the 4d case",
    ", the above differential equation does not have a solution which describes increasing mass .",
    "however , in the brane high - energy era , it does give a growing solution ; _ accretion _ occurs in the braneworld scenario .",
    "substituting relevant expressions for the brane high - energy phase into the above differential equation , the resultant form becomes @xmath82 integrating it gives the mass evolution formula @xcite @xmath83 we define the _ primordial _ mass @xmath84 of 5d pbhs at the end of accretion as @xmath85 .",
    "readers should not confuse @xmath86 with @xmath84 . for 4d pbhs , @xmath87 .      the differential particle emission rate from a @xmath88-dimensional static uncharged black hole with mass @xmath59",

    "the absorption cross section @xmath93 is an essential part of the famous quantity named _ greybody _ factor .",
    "it determines how far the radiation spectrum deviates from that of blackbody . although black holes under our considerations are higher - dimensional , ordinary particles will be emitted by them into the four - dimensional brane , and once the hawking temperature of a black hole is fixed , the emission processes are almost unchanged from the 4d case .",

    "further , if the theory has a fundamental mass scale lower than 4d planck , which is somewhat likely , then hawking temperature will drops like that in the rs2 analysis and hence our results may be directly applied with some modification .",
    "here we summarize this paper .",
    "we investigated antiproton flux emitted from pbhs distributed over the galaxy as dark matter .",
    "mass of pbhs which could contribute to the antiproton spectrum was in the 5d evaporating region of the present mass spectrum , which meant that the effect of accretion had been almost completely swept out . because the antiproton emissivity of individual pbh was almost unchanged from that in the 4d case , the change in the resultant antiproton flux only came from the change of the slope of the mass spectrum ; in the large extra - dimension case , @xmath261 , while with the small extra - dimension , @xmath262 .",
    "however , this also does not affect the antiproton flux so much because the flux is still dominated by the contribution of pbhs with temperatures around @xmath263 .",
    "finally we understood that the whole situation is almost identical with the 4d case , which was shown by the expected flux in fig .",

    ", we found that the antiproton flux from brane pbhs was a decreasing function of the bulk curvature radius @xmath2 like @xmath264 the reason why the flux decreases is that the temperature of a black hole is lowered as @xmath2 enlarges , while accretion takes a quite limited role in contrast to the photon case @xcite .",
    "therefore lower bounds on the size of the extra dimension were obtained .",
