    "magnetic insulators are a class of materials realized in many various compounds .",
    "an example of them are materials known as transition metal cluster compounds with general formula @xmath3 , where @xmath4trivalence metal , @xmath5transition metal , @xmath6chalcogenide @xcite .",
    "phase separations can occur in magnetic insulators in various circumstances and their theoretical understanding is very current topic .",
    "moreover , instabilities such as stripe formation ( as well as charge order ) can occur in high-@xmath7 superconductors ( e.g. in cuprates )  @xcite .",
    "a simplified model to describe behavior of such materials is the extended hubbard model with intersite magnetic interactions @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the zero - bandwidth limit of the extended hubbard model .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model has the form : @xmath8 where @xmath1  is the on - site density - density interaction , @xmath0  is of the intersite magnetic exchange interaction , and @xmath9 is chemical potential .",
    "the interactions are effective model parameters and are assumed to include all the possible contributions and renormalizations .",
    "@xmath10 restricts the summation to nearest neighbors ( independently ) .",
    "is total electron number on site @xmath11 and is @xmath12-component of total spin at @xmath11 site . is electron number with spin @xmath13 on site @xmath11 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , of an electron with spin @xmath13 ( ) at the site @xmath11 .",
    "the electron concentration @xmath16 is defined as , where @xmath17 is the total number of sites .",
    "the model studied exhibits two symmetries : ( i )  the symmetry between ( antiferromagnetic ) and ( ferromagnetic ) cases and ( ii ) the electron - hole symmetry . because of these symmetries only analyses for and have been performed .",
    "we have used the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to analyze the system .",
    "simulations have been done using hamiltonian described above on two dimensional square lattice with sites in the grand canonical ensemble , which allows us to obtain e.g. chemical potential dependence of electron concentration curves  @xmath18 .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm used in this analysis consists of three steps : ( i ) creation , ( ii ) destruction , and ( iii ) moving of particle , all of them with appropriate probability @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting , that for constant values of concentration a  simpler algorithm with only step ( iii )  , , move  would be sufficient .",
    "however , addition of the grand canonical parts ( creation and destruction ) allows one for more detailed analysis in full range of chemical potential and concentration .",
    "unfortunately , addition of chemical potential term in the hamiltonian prevents us from implementing cluster updates algorithm , so only local updates @xcite are used here .",
    "the details of the algorithm used can be found in @xcite .",
    "the exact ground state ( ) results for this model have been found in the case of a   chain @xcite using the green function formalism as well as for case @xcite .",
    "the rigorous results for finite temperatures have been also obtained @xcite for chain ( an absence of long - range order at ) . within the variational approach ( with",
    "on - site @xmath1 term treated exactly and mean field decoupling of intersite term @xmath0 ) the model has been analyzed for half - filing ( ) @xcite as well as for arbitrary electron concentration @xcite ( these results are rigorous in the limit of infinite dimensions ) .",
    "our preliminary monte carlo ( mc ) results have been presented in @xcite for and on - site repulsion : ( corresponding to rather weak and strong coupling , respectively ) @xcite as well as for and @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate in details the phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of the model for arbitrary electron concentration and arbitrary chemical potential ( ) in the whole range of temperatures for and .",
    "in particular , we focus on a  behavior of an  electron compressibility .",
    "the corresponding results for ( ) are obvious because of the electron - hole symmetry of the model on alternate lattices mentioned previously .",
    "finite temperature phase diagrams for this model were obtained using mc simulations for ( and ) as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath16 are presented in fig .  [ fig : phasediagrams](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagrams](b ) , respectively .",
    "the behavior of this system for fixed @xmath21 is rather simple ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagrams](a ) ) , with both first - order ( below @xmath22-point ) and second - order ( above @xmath22-point ) phase transitions separating non - ordered ( no ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) phases with tricirtical point @xmath22 located at , ( ) . the location of @xmath22-point has been determined using hysteresis analysis @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagrams](a ) `` heating '' and `` cooling '' label the boundaries obtained by simulation performed with increasing and decreasing temperature whereas `` average '' is the average of these two results .",
    "they differ if the transition is first - order .",
    "details of this method can be found in @xcite .    with simulations done for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath23  vs.  @xmath20 , it is possible to obtain phase diagrams as a function of @xmath16 ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagrams](b ) ) by determining electron density above ( @xmath24 ) and below ( @xmath25 ) the phase transition ( for fixed @xmath21 ) .",
    "the first - order boundary for fixed @xmath21 splits into two boundaries ( i.e. and ) for fixed @xmath16 . at sufficiently low temperatures , i.e. below @xmath22-point , a  phase separated",
    "( ps : af / no ) state occurs .",
    "the ps state is a  coexistence of two ( af and no ) homogeneous phases . at higher temperatures ( i.e. above @xmath22-point )",
    "the transition is second - order one .",
    "an objective indicator of a  ps state existence is the evolution of the compressibility @xmath2 of the system @xcite . for a system with variable number of particles",
    "it can be defined as @xmath26 from this definition it follows that at a fixed @xmath9 the number of particles in an open system can fluctuate freely ( precisely , in some define range ) when .",
    "such a behavior is connected with an occurrence of the ps states in define range of @xmath16 . at the same constant total free energy of the system",
    "the number of domains as well as their distribution can change .",
    "hence , the phase separation states are , , highly unstable  in that sense that they are subjected to continuous fluctuations of local density ( but the total density @xmath16 is constant ) .     as a function of temperature @xmath27 for constant values of electron concentration @xmath16 ( as labeled ) for . for there are fluctuations of @xmath2 associated with second - order phase transitions . ]     on @xmath23@xmath16 plane ( for ) .",

    "[ fig : comruns ] the compressibility @xmath28 is plotted versus temperature @xmath23 for several constant values of @xmath16 . as is clearly seen , close to the boundaries of the ps : af / no state occurrence plotted in fig  [ fig : phasediagrams](b ) , the value of compressibility abruptly increase and at transition temperature , indicating an existence of the phase separation state . at higher temperatures and for larger concentrations than those corresponding to the @xmath22-point ( )",
    "there are compressibility fluctuations related to second order phase transition as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : comruns ] at higher temperatures .",
    "they are significantly smaller than the fluctuations close to the boundaries below which the ps : af / no state occurs .",
    "[ fig : phasecom ] presents a map of compressibility on plane together with the phase boundaries derived in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagrams](b ) plotted for the comparison .",
    "an increase of compressibility close to the second - order boundary is clearly seen .",
    "the boundary between homogeneous phases and phase separation state is also visible , with the compressibility close to the boundary being at least an order of magnitude greater than those inside the homogeneous phases .",
    "as it was said earlier , in the case of phase separation occurrence @xmath29 , so no points are shown inside the region of the ps state occurrence in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasecom ] .",
    "notice that the results presented are in good qualitative agreement with mean field calculations using variational approach presented in @xcite . when comparing these results one should keep in mind differences between these two methods , as the va is exact only for infinite dimensions @xmath30 .",
    "the drawback of monte carlo simulations is long thermalization time , which prevents us from obtaining results for the ground state and very low temperatures , as in these conditions electrons have very small probability of escaping local energy minima .",
    "behavior of the model considered in the case of finite band ( @xmath31 ) is very interesting and mostly open problem in the general case @xcite .",
