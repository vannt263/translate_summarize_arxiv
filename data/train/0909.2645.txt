    "occasionally , two clusters of roughly equal mass fall together in a major merger , releasing around @xmath0erg of gravitational potential energy during the merger process @xcite .",
    "to a degree , the majority of clusters exhibit evidence for merger activity .",
    "however it is the _ scale _ of the cluster mergers , i.e. , the distinction between major mergers and the continuing minor mergers / infall of smaller subsystems , that is difficult to quantify .",
    "a gauge of merger activity capable of distinguishing major and minor mergers would greatly assist to understand mergers and their effects on clusters and their constituents .",
    "a solution may be provided by high resolution x - ray observations with the _ chandra_observatory @xcite . among its first discoveries",
    "was the detection and characterization of the `` cold front '' phenomenon in the intracluster media ( icm ) of abell  2142 @xcite and abell  3667 @xcite .",
    "cold fronts reveal themselves as edge - like features in the _ chandra _  images and are well modeled as contact discontinuities which form at the interface of cool , dense gas and hotter , more diffuse gas .",
    "simulations show cold fronts can arise in more than one way during cluster mergers @xcite . broadly speaking",
    ", cold fronts can be separated into two general types : `` remnant core '' and `` sloshing '' ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "remnant core type cold fronts were first invoked to explain the origin of the cold fronts in abell  2142 @xcite . in this case , the discontinuity occurs between the interface of an infalling subcluster s cool core and the hotter ambient icm of the main cluster .",
    "the subcluster s core is bared to the hotter icm after ram pressure stripping removes its less dense , lower pressure outer atmosphere during its passage through the main cluster .",
    "the cool core survives longest because , at first , it remains bound to the infalling dark matter core and , after separating from that , because of its high density .",
    "this explanation for abell  2142 s cold fronts has since been abandoned in favor of a `` sloshing '' type mechanism @xcite .",
    "an excellent example of remnant core type cold front is observed in the bullet cluster ( 1es0657 - 558 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while a similar mechanism acts to form cold fronts in the elliptical galaxies ngc  1404 and ngc  4552 ( where the cold fronts are at the interface of the galaxy s gas and the cluster icm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , remnant core type cold fronts have also been seen in both idealized @xcite and cosmological @xcite simulations of cluster mergers .",
    "gas `` sloshing '' came to the fore as an explanation for the existence of a cold front in the `` relaxed '' cluster abell  1795 @xcite .",
    "these cold fronts occur when the stably stratified icm is disturbed in such a way that the cool , dense gas residing in the cluster core is displaced from its position at the bottom of the gravitational potential well .",
    "the cold front is the contact discontinuity formed at the interface of the low entropy core gas and the higher entropy gas at larger radii . in",
    "most postulated scenarios , the disturbance is gravitational in nature with its origin in an infalling subcluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , there have been suggestions the disturbance may be a hydrodynamic phenomenon in the form of weak shocks or acoustic waves @xcite , while @xcite suggest agn explosions may be responsible , although the example of hydra  a used was later shown to be better interpreted as a weak shock @xcite . to date , the @xcite study provides the most comprehensive set of simulations for the sloshing scenario and show it is possible that the cold fronts observed in otherwise relaxed appearing clusters ( based on their x - ray morphologies ) can be produced by sloshing induced in relatively minor mergers .",
    "currently , there is no observational evidence that the cold fronts in these relaxed appearing clusters are related to merger activity .    while cold fronts offer interesting insights into the physical properties of the icm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is how their presence relates to cluster merger activity , along with the tantalizing possibility of utilizing cold fronts as a gauge for cluster mergers , which provides the motivation for the study presented in this paper . _",
    "the utilization of cold fronts as merger gauges becomes even more compelling when considering those clusters which appear to harbor relaxed x - ray morphologies  the existence of a cold front provides the only indication of ongoing merger activity at x - ray wavelengths_. much work has gone into studying cold front formation with simulations , but what has been lacking to date is a systematic study of the relationship between cold fronts and other dynamical indicators of cluster merger activity .",

    "chandra _ to harbor cold fronts has grown significantly and now allows a representative sample to be assembled in order to perform such a study . to this end",
    ", this paper focuses on the selection of a sample of clusters with cold fronts in their _ chandra _ x - ray images .",
    "the selection criteria are designed to ensure that the high quality x - ray data shows an unambiguous cold front in each member of the sample .    to date , our goal of establishing whether there is a link between the presence of cold fronts in clusters and evidence of recent dynamical growth has been met , at least partially , in two cases , abell  1201 @xcite and abell  3667 @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "significant dynamical substructure was detected using spatial and redshift information provided by large samples of spectroscopically confirmed cluster member galaxies . in these clusters ,",
    "the presence of a cold front is directly related to the presence of substructures , and thus ongoing merger activity .",
    "future work will endeavor to go one step further and study the galaxy properties within the cold front clusters .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ selcrit ] the procedure for selecting cold front clusters",
    "is presented . in section  [ tempmaps ]",
    "the technique used to generate projected temperature maps for each cold front cluster is described . in section  [ cf.clusters ]",
    "the _ chandra _ x - ray images and temperature maps for the clusters in the cold front sample are presented , along with a brief description of the x - ray properties and evidence for merger activity from the literature . in section  [ discussion ] , the results and sample are discussed . in section  [ summary ]",
    "summary and conclusions are presented .",
    "to ensure selection of only the best defined cold front clusters , the following criteria were set .",
    "the data must be of high enough quality that statistically robust measurements of density and temperature can be made on either side of the edge in surface brightness for characterization .",
    "the bulk of the cluster x - ray emission must be captured on the _ chandra _ chips , whilst resolution and cosmological surface brightness dimming affects must be minimized .",
    "clearly , the cluster must also exhibit an edge in the surface brightness , indicating the existence of a density discontinuity caused by a cold front .",
    "the initial sample was selected from those clusters with publicly available data within the _ chandra _ archive ( as of july 2006 ) and the preceding conditions were imposed as the following quantitative criteria :    * a total _",
    "chandra _",
    "acis - i and/or acis - s exposure time exceeding 40ks ; * cluster redshift in the range @xmath1 ; * a significant edge in the x - ray surface brightness .",
    "the density discontinuities caused by cold fronts are generally quite visible in the _ chandra _  images , and their existence is easily verified by the observation of edges and compression of isophotal contours overlaid onto the images .",
    "thus , for each _ chandra _  data set meeting the first three selection criteria , the 0.5  7kev band image was scrutinized for edge - like features and regions of compressed isophotes .",
    "it is noted that the morphology of the x - ray emission was not considered during the selection process , nor were any clusters selected based on prior knowledge of a cold front in their icm .",
    "the significance of the density discontinuity was quantified by modeling the surface brightness across the edge with a broken power law density model ( see appendix  [ sb.model ] ) .",
    "the surface brightness edge must also be reasonably sharp , i.e. , in order to be classified as a front , they must be reasonably well fitted by the density jump model .",
    "this model was used to further cull the sample and is presented in appendix  [ sb.model ] .",
    "a description of the method used to fit the model to the data follows .",
    "corresponding to the broken power law density model , the surface brightness model given in equation  [ sb.mod ] was incorporated into the _ sherpa _",
    "fitting software , which is part of the _ chandra interactive analysis of observations _",
    "( _ ciao _ ; version 3.4 is used here ) package .",
    "point sources were identified using the _ ciao _ wavdetect tool and removed for fitting .",
    "the images were restricted to the energy range 0.5  7kev , so that background and instrument effects were minimized , whilst still allowing enough source photons to obtain good fits to the models .",
    "where possible , separate observations had their data and exposure maps co - added prior to fitting .",
    "the background count rates for _ chandra _  observations is known to change with time , and also to differ between the acis - s and acis - i arrays . for these reasons , observations taken at significantly different times , or taken using different chips were not co - added , but were simultaneously fitted with separate background components .",
    "the fit was restricted to regions where there are edges ( the blue regions shown in the top left panels of figures  [ fig:1e657a ] through [ fig : a2142a ] ) , and the initial inputs for the center of the spheroid , the ellipticity , @xmath2 , the orientation angle , @xmath3 , and the radius at which the edge occurs , @xmath4 , were obtained by overlaying an elliptical region that best approximated the surface brightness contours across the edge .",
    "the center of curvature was not necessarily the position of the x - ray centroid of the cluster , and the semimajor axis of the ellipse , @xmath3 , was oriented to bisect the edge . since the center , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are highly degenerate , the center and @xmath3 were fixed to those values determined from the manually fitted ellipse and only @xmath4 was determined directly from the fit .",
    "a fixed , uniform background component was added to the model during fitting . the background was determined by fitting the entire _ chandra _ observed area using one or two beta models plus a constant component .",
    "the beta model / s account for the cluster emission , and the constant component for the background .",
    "we note that this constant background component does not correctly account for the unvignetted instrumental background .",
    "this does not affect our results because : a ) the edges are found in regions where the cluster emission is dominant and b ) the quantity of interest is the break in the surface brightness profile which is insensitive to both the background level and to small changes in the background slope ( when the background does not dominate ) .",
    "each model was multiplied by the exposure map , generated using the _ ciao _ mkinstmap , asphist and mkexpmap tools , which account for instrumental effects such as vignetting , quantum efficiency ( qe ) , qe nonuniformity , bad pixels , dithering and effective area .    after fitting the density model ( appendix  [ sb.mod ] ) ,",
    "the sample was limited to include only those clusters where the density jump exceeded a factor of 1.5 at the lower limit of the @xmath5 confidence interval .",
    "the confidence intervals were estimated using the projection tool in _ sherpa _ , which varies the parameter of interest along a grid of values whilst allowing adjustable model parameters to settle to their new best - fitted values .",
    "this criterion eliminated several clusters with clearly visible surface brightness edges from the sample .",
    "thus , any detectable cold fronts in clusters meeting the other selection criteria above that were missed in the search of the archive are unlikely to have density jumps exceeding a factor of 1.5 .",
    "the 11 clusters which meet the above criteria , along with the parameters for the fits , are presented in table  [ sb.params ] .",
    "the corresponding surface brightness distributions with the surface brightness profiles for the best fitting density models overlaid are plotted in figure  [ sb.profc ] .",
    "interestingly , abell  2142 is the only one of the 11 clusters to require a significant ellipticity in the fits .",
    "it is noted that density jumps determined from the surface brightness fits do not depend on the curvature of the front ( @xmath6 in appendix  [ sb.mod ] ) , but they do depend on the assumption that the density profiles can be expressed in terms of the same coordinate ( @xmath7 in equation  [ sb_ne ] ) on both sides of the front .",
    "observation identification number , cluster center and redshift are presented in table  [ chap_cfsel : front.clusters ] along with global spectral properties ( section  [ global ] ) . to confirm that these structures are cold fronts , temperature measurements on each side of the front are required ( see section  [ temp.jumps ] ) .",

    "the pressure ( @xmath93 ) across a cold front should be continuous , whilst a shock front should show a pressure discontinuity .",
    "the specific entropy , specified here in terms of the entropy index , @xmath94 , should also change rapidly across a cold front since , regardless of the physical mechanism causing the cold front , the front occurs at the interface of cool , dense low entropy gas and the hotter , ambient higher entropy icm .",
    "thus , a jump in the entropy across a front is expected which will also be opposite to the entropy change expected across a shock front . to ensure the observed surface brightness edges are indeed cold fronts ,",
    "the temperature was measured just inside and outside the edges and used in combination with the density jumps measured above to derive changes in pressure and entropy across the edges .",
    "the precision of the pressure measurements across the fronts is determined by limitations in both the data and the assumptions used in modeling the surface brightness across the edges to obtain densities .",
    "for example , in obtaining densities it has been assumed that the gas density is a function of the elliptical radius .",
    "this is an approximation , which may be poor if , e.g. , there is emission from gas projected onto the edge region , or there are rapid , nonradial variations in the gas distribution .",
    "these effects are reduced by confining attention to the most prominent fronts , where the x - ray emission is generally dominated by gas close to the front . furthermore , while pressure continuity holds in the immediate vicinity of the cold front , if there is a stagnation region at the front then in upstream regions away from the cold front , where the velocity gradient is high , the pressure will vary ( see figure 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "thus , pressure measurements must be made in regions as close to the front as possible .",
    "the size of these regions is most affected by the temperature measurements , which require a large number of counts in order to be accurate , meaning the precision of the pressure measurement across the edges is limited mostly by the temperature measurements , rather than the shortcomings of the surface brightness model .    in order to minimize the above effects ,",
    "regions from which spectra were extracted for temperature measurements are chosen to lie as close as possible to the fronts .",
    "the opening angles for these regions correspond to those used for measuring the surface brightness profiles in section  [ sb.fit ] ( see the blue regions plotted in the left panel of figures  [ fig:1e657a ] through [ fig : a2142a ] ) .",
    "three exceptions exist in abell  1201 , abell  665 and ms1455.0 + 2232 where for the region just outside the edge , a slightly larger region with a larger angular extent was used ( ms1455.0 + 2232 has a slightly larger radius compared to the region where the surface brightness profile was measured , too ) , so that there are enough counts to measure the temperature with sufficient accuracy . using a larger angular extent was preferred to increasing the radial extent for the reasons discussed above .",
    "regions were chosen with a minimum of 700 counts in the 0.5  7kev energy range after background subtraction .",
    "the green arcs shown in top left panels of figures  [ fig:1e657a ] through [ fig : a2142a ] show the inner and outer limits for the regions used to measure the temperatures on the inside and outside of the edges , respectively .",
    "where a green arc is not plotted , the radial limit used corresponds to that used in measuring the surface brightness profile ( i.e. the blue regions ) .    the procedure for fitting the temperature inside and outside the edge was as follows .",
    "first , the temperature in the region outside the edge was fitted using an absorbed mekal model with the column density and metallicity fixed and @xmath95 inside and outside the front , respectively . ] to the values derived in section  [ global ] .",
    "second , the spectrum from the region just inside the edge was fitted with two absorbed mekal models .",
    "the first mekal component accounts for the denser parcel of gas lying within the edge .",
    "the second mekal component accounts for gas lying in projection along the line of sight which is assumed to have the same thermal properties as the gas fitted in the region outside the edge .",

    "the temperature map presented in the top right panel of figure  [ fig : rxj1720a ] reveals more about the nature of the cold front . there is a finger of cool gas starting at the surface brightness peak and spiraling in an anticlockwise direction before terminating at the cold front ,",

    "the cold front appears similar to those seen in the simulations of @xcite ( see figure 7 and figure 19 ) where an off - center merger of a gasless dark matter halo disturbs the cool cluster core , offsetting both the gas and dark matter from its initial position . the offset low entropy gas does not fall back into the core along a purely radial path , since it has acquired angular momentum from the infalling dark matter halo , and thus a spiral pattern is formed .",
    "further evidence for merger activity in ms1455.0 + 2232 comes from the weak lensing maps of @xcite , where , despite showing a fairly regular projected galaxy number density distribution , the weak lensing maps showed a highly elliptical morphology with major axis pointing along an axis going from south - west to north - east ( similar to the x - ray major axis angle ) .",

    "the north - west cold front appears to have a cometary morphology with the sharp brightness edge to the north - west forming the head , and a tail pointing towards the south - east where the surface brightness drops less sharply with radius .",
    "the temperature map presented in the top right panel of figure  [ fig : a2142a ] is generated using a much longer exposure ( obsid 5005 data ) than the one shown in @xcite and reveals a complex temperature distribution , where the two cold fronts clearly separate regions of cool and hot gas .",
    "the temperature morphology of the central region is very similar to that seen by @xcite , i.e. , the brightness peak is much cooler ( @xmath155kev ) than the gas at larger radii , and there is a finger of @xmath119kev gas extending from the core towards the north - west .",
    "the regions inside the north - west cold front are hotter than the core gas , at @xmath163kev , but significantly cooler than the gas at larger radii outside the front ( @xmath164kev ) .",
    "note that towards the south - east , the gas temperature is around @xmath165kev , inconsistent with the rise in temperature seen in the same region by @xcite .",
    "this difference is likely attributed to the different data sets used@xcite used early acis - s data where the calibration was poorly known , whereas here the acis - i data are used along with the latest and much improved calibration files .",
    "the exact nature of the cold fronts is uncertain .",
    "@xcite propose they are due to the survival of dense subcluster cores during a major merger , but later @xcite claim the cold fronts are more likely to be the result of core gas motion ( not unlike rxj1720.1 + 2638 , ms1455.0 + 2232 and abell  1201 of this sample ) .",
    "however , abell  2142 seems anomalous since , while there is a finger of cool gas extending from the core towards the north - west , this finger does not form a coherent spiral - like temperature structure joining the core to the north - western cold front , as seen in the clusters ms1455.0 + 2232 and rxj1720.1 + 2638 .",
    "this of course could be due simply to different viewing angles , since the existence of multiple fronts lying on different sides of the cluster core is fairly compelling evidence for sloshing type cold fronts .",
    "power ratio analyses of rosat x - ray images gave an indication that abell  2142 was a dynamically active system @xcite , and the case for a merger was strengthened by the analysis of @xcite , which showed strong variations in the azimuthal temperature distribution .",
    "in an earlier study using 103 cluster member redshifts , @xcite found evidence for substructure at the @xmath5 confidence level using the dressler - shectmann @xmath166 test , although they were unable to isolate the substructure spatially or in velocity space and conclude abell  2142 is a cluster with uncertain dynamics .",
    "indirect evidence for dynamical activity came from the observation of two dominant bright elliptical galaxies in the cluster core , with one having a redshift consistent with the cluster mean redshift and the second offset in peculiar velocity by @xmath167@xmath114 .",
    "further evidence for dynamical activity came from the weak lensing maps of @xcite , who found evidence for a significant excess in their weak lensing signal at a projected distance of @xmath168kpc ahead of the north - west cold front . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "abell  2142 exhibits diffuse radio emission extending @xmath169kpc about the cluster core , although it is unclear whether this is part of a massive radio halo associated with a cluster merger @xcite .",
    "@xcite show a nat source which has a tail extending away from the cluster center and in roughly the same direction as the major axis of the x - ray emission .",
    "this nat galaxy is displaced by @xmath170@xmath114 from the cluster rest frame , and its head is located just within the edge of the north - west cold front ( coincident with the x - ray point source seen to lie just within the north - west cold front in figure  [ fig : a2142a ] ) . despite the uncertain nature of the merger geometry , it is clear that abell  2142 is a dynamically active cluster .",
    "selecting clusters based purely on the existence of a cold front has produced a sample with two distinct x - ray morphological types : those with clearly disturbed x - ray morphologies ( section  [ disturbed ] ) and those with fairly relaxed x - ray appearances , aside from the cold fronts ( section  [ relaxed ] ) . in table",
    "[ merger.evidence ] , the evidence indicating merger activity for the cold front sample , along with the x - ray morphologies , is summarized . once again , to emphasize the dichotomy , the clusters in table  [ merger.evidence ] are separated into the two subsamples presented in section  [ cf.clusters ] .    of the six clusters in section  [ disturbed ] , five have significant evidence for merger - related activity at other wavelengths and ,",
    "as was evident from their x - ray morphologies , it is clear the existence of a cold front is good evidence for merger activity .",
    "the sixth cluster , abell  2069 , does have evidence for substructure in its projected galaxy density @xcite , although it is not as well studied at multiple wavelengths when compared to the other five clusters , thus the evidence for merger - related activity at other wavelengths is less compelling . within this subsample",
    "there are a broad range of x - ray morphologies .",
    "this can be traced to the different formation mechanisms for cold fronts which depend on the details of the merger event ( e.g. merger stage , mass of subcluster , impact parameter or the existence of cool cores ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , upon comparing abell  1201 to 1es0657 - 558 , it can be seen that both contain remnant cores observed after pericentric passage . however , abell  1201 s cold front is due to gas sloshing of the primary s cool core , while the cold front in 1es0657 - 558  occurs in the remnant core and there is no evidence for a cold front due to motion of its primary s core .",
    "two scenarios relating the details of the initial conditions of the mergers to the cold front formation can explain this : ( 1 ) the primary in 1es0657 - 558  did not contain a significant cool core , thus no cold fronts analogous to those in abell  1201 are seen .",
    "( 2 ) the impact parameters of the mergers differ significantly , i.e. , the merger in the 1es0657 - 558  was almost directly head on , thus the primary s core was destroyed by the secondary s passage , while the pericentric passage of the secondary in abell  1201 was off - axis and did not significantly disrupt the cool core allowing the formation of the cold fronts .",
    "thus , aside from being good merger signposts , cold fronts also provide additional information which can be used in tandem with observations at other wavelengths to constrain the merger histories in these clusters .",
    "turning to the clusters in section  [ relaxed ] , table  [ merger.evidence ] shows that currently there is very little observational evidence in the literature to determine a clear cut explanation for the cold fronts in clusters with overall relaxed morphologies .",
    "the simulations of @xcite showed that pure gravitational disturbances in the form of infalling gasless dark matter subclumps are able to produce these cold fronts whilst maintaining the overall relaxed appearance .",
    "commonly seen in simulations of this scenario are spiral - like temperature structures , which we also see in the temperature maps of rxj1720.1 + 2638 and ms1455.0 + 2232 ( figures [ fig : rxj1720a ] and [ fig : ms1455a ] , respectively ) , showing the cool gas causing the front to be connected to the cool cluster core . also apparent in these simulations",
    "are the existence of multiple cold fronts at different radii ; a signature clearly observed in abell  2142 .",
    "marginal evidence is found favoring this scenario in rxj1720.1 + 2638 @xcite , where there is substructure in the galaxy density distribution but no apparent secondary structure in the x - ray image . with further optical data , rxj1720.1 + 2638 , abell  2142 and",
    "ms1455.0 + 2232 could provide definitive tests of the scenario put forth by @xcite where an essentially gas - free group perturbs the core icm , setting off sloshing whilst providing minimal further evidence of a merger at x - ray wavelengths .    while much of the evidence favoring a merger origin for the relaxed appearing sloshing type cold front clusters comes from simulations ,",
    "two significant observations exist which show the plausibility of merger - induced sloshing as a mechanism for the formation of cold fronts .",
    "the xmm observations of abell  1644 @xcite and the _ chandra _ observations of abell  1201 presented here and in @xcite both reveal sloshing cold fronts and also remnant cores which are apparently causing the perturbation .",
    "the optical follow up observations of abell  1201 showed evidence for localized velocity substructure coincident with the remnant core @xcite , confirming it is a significant merging substructure , although the latest optical observations of abell  1644 do not reveal significant evidence for localized velocity substructure @xcite . without detailed simulations of these two particular objects , it is unclear whether they will evolve into relaxed appearing clusters with cold fronts , like those presented in section  [ relaxed ] . nevertheless , it is clear that both abell  1644 and abell  1201 provide strong empirical evidence of merger - induced sloshing as a viable mechanism for producing cold fronts .",
    "perhaps the most appealing outcome that studies of cold front clusters offer is the possibility of using them to distinguish major and minor mergers .",
    "clearly the clusters in section  [ disturbed ] are systems which are undergoing significant dynamical evolution and are most likely major mergers . however , the same conclusion can not be drawn based on the evidence available for the clusters presented in section  [ relaxed ] . as discussed above",
    ", @xcite found that only a relatively minor merger was required to produce cold fronts in relaxed appearing clusters .",
    "future dynamical analyses of rxj1720.1 + 2638 , abell  2142 and ms1455.0 + 2232 at optical wavelengths will determine the level of dynamical activity required to produce a cold front . if it turns out to be true that the appearance of these clusters can be explained by minor mergers , then the combination of the existence of a cold front and x - ray morphology will provide a useful diagnostic for discriminating major and minor mergers in clusters .",
    "we have presented and described in detail a sample of nine clusters selected from the _ chandra _  archive based purely on the existence of cold fronts in their icm .",
    "these clusters are the subject of an ongoing study to determine if cold fronts may be used to reliably identify recent cluster - cluster mergers .",
    "in selecting the cold front sample , particular attention was paid to obtaining highly reliable identifications . to this end , each cluster met the following strict selection criteria : a total _",
    "chandra _",
    "exposure time greater than 40ks , @xmath171 , a visible surface brightness edge in the x - ray image which has a density jump exceeding 1.5 at the lower @xmath5 confidence level , the measured gas temperature must be lower on the denser side of the front , and the pressure must be continuous across the front within the errors .",
    "this resulted in the identification of nine cold front clusters for which we present temperature maps , x - ray and optical images and an overview of the multiwavelength evidence for merger activity available in the literature .",
    "the key conclusions of this study are as follows :    * the measurement of thermal properties across the fronts was an essential diagnostic tool ; abell  2034 and abell  665 were rejected on this basis , since their fronts were better explained as shocks .",
    "these are very likely merger shocks and if these clusters were to remain in our sample , the contamination would not be harmful when considering the aim is to use cold fronts as reliable signposts of merger activity .",
    "* there is a dichotomy within the sample of cold front clusters : those which harbor clearly disturbed x - ray morphologies , and those which appear to have fairly relaxed x - ray morphologies , apart from the existence of a cold front .",
    "* the majority of those clusters with disturbed x - ray morphologies have significant evidence for merger activity at multiple wavelengths , while minimal evidence for a merger exists at other wavelengths in the relaxed appearing clusters . * two of the relaxed appearing clusters ( rxj1720.1 + 2638  and ms1455.0 + 2232 ) exhibit spiral - like structures in their temperature maps , similar to those seen in the simulations of @xcite .    to conclude , in the case of the cold front clusters with disturbed morphologies ,",
    "it is clear that a cold front is an excellent signpost for ongoing major merger activity .",
    "however , it appears verification that all cold fronts are signatures of merger activity ( major merger or otherwise ) relies critically on the results of follow up observations of the relaxed appearing cold front clusters .",
    "the sample is the subject of extensive follow up observations using multi - object spectroscopy at optical wavelengths to obtain large samples of confirmed cluster members .",

    "as illustrated in figure  [ sb.profc ] , surface brightness does change abruptly at cold fronts , which can give the misleading impression of a discontinuity .                                        , s. , percival , w.  j. , peacock , j.  a. , norberg , p. , baugh , c.  m. , frenk , c.  s. , baldry , i. , bland - hawthorn , j. , bridges , t. , cannon , r. , colless , m. , collins , c. , couch , w. , cross , n.  j.  g. , dalton , g. , eke , v.  r. , de propris , r. , driver , s.  p. , efstathiou , g. , ellis , r.  s. , glazebrook , k. , jackson , c. , jenkins , a. , lahav , o. , lewis , i. , lumsden , s. , maddox , s. , madgwick , d. , peterson , b.  a. , sutherland , w. , & taylor , k. 2005 , , 362 , 505                                                                  , m. , bautz , m.  w. , biller , b. , butt , y. , edgar , r. , gaetz , t. , garmire , g. , grant , c.  e. , green , p. , juda , m. , plucinsky , p.  p. , schwartz , d. , smith , r. , vikhlinin , a. , virani , s. , wargelin , b.  j. , & wolk , s. 2003 , , 583 , 70        , m. , ponman , t.  j. , nulsen , p.  e.  j. , bautz , m.  w. , burke , d.  j. , david , l.  p. , davis , d. , donnelly , r.  h. , forman , w.  r. , jones , c. , kaastra , j. , kellogg , e. , kim , d .- w . , kolodziejczak , j. , mazzotta , p. , pagliaro , a. , patel , s. , van speybroeck , l. , vikhlinin , a. , vrtilek , j. , wise , m. , & zhao , p. 2000 , , 541 , 542                                                                        , g.  f. , bennett , c.  l. , kogut , a. , wright , e.  l. , aymon , j. , boggess , n.  w. , cheng , e.  s. , de amici , g. , gulkis , s. , hauser , m.  g. , hinshaw , g. , jackson , p.  d. , janssen , m. , kaita , e. , kelsall , t. , keegstra , p. , lineweaver , c. , loewenstein , k. , lubin , p. , mather , j. , meyer , s.  s. , moseley , s.  h. , murdock , t. , rokke , l. , silverberg , r.  f. , tenorio , l. , weiss , r. , & wilkinson , d.  t. 1992 , , 396 , l1                              ccccccc 1es0657 - 558 & disturbed , remnant core & shock front , & projected galaxy density , & halo & substructure & 1 , 3 , 10 + & & cool remnant core & position plus velocity & & & + abell  3667 & disturbed&cool mushroom - cap , & projected galaxy density&relic , nats & substructure & 9 , 17 , 18 + & & hot patches & position plus velocity & & + abell  1201 & remnant core , elliptical , & cool finger joining & projected galaxy density , & & & 16 + & cool core&cold front and cool core & position plus velocity & & & + abell  2069 & elliptical , remnant core&cool remnant core , & projected galaxy density & & & 6 + & & hot patches & & & & + abell  1758n & disturbed ,",

    "<S> this paper presents a sample of `` cold front '' clusters selected from the _ chandra_archive . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters are selected based purely on the existence of surface brightness edges in their _ chandra _  images which are modeled as density jumps . a combination of the derived density and temperature jumps across the fronts is used to select nine robust examples of cold front clusters : 1es0657 - 558 , abell  1201 , abell  1758n , ms1455.0 + 2232 , abell  2069 , abell  2142 , abell  2163 , rxj1720.1 + 2638 , and abell  3667 . </S>",
    "<S> this sample is the subject of an ongoing study aimed at relating cold fronts to cluster merger activity , and understanding how the merging environment affects the cluster constituents . here </S>",
    "<S> , temperature maps are presented along with the _ chandra _  x - ray images . </S>",
    "<S> a dichotomy is found in the sample in that there exists a subsample of cold front clusters which are clearly mergers based on their x - ray morphologies , and a second subsample which harbor cold fronts , but have surprisingly relaxed x - ray morphologies , and minimal evidence for merger activity at other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> for this second subsample , the existence of a cold front provides the sole evidence for merger activity at x - ray wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how cold fronts can provide additional information which may be used to constrain merger histories , and also the possibility of using cold fronts to distinguish major and minor mergers . </S>"
