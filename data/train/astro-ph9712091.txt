    "analyses of the angular and intensity distributions of gamma - ray bursts require knowledge of instrumental sensitivities and biases ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to have available not just a catalog of gamma - ray bursts detected by an experiment , but a summary describing the sensitivity of the experiment to detecting gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the sensitivity is generally subdivided into two components : angular exposure ( describing the angular instrumental sensitivity ) , and trigger efficiency ( describing the flux - dependent instrumental sensitivity ) .",
    "angular exposure is described here ; the algorithm to be used for calculating trigger efficiency is described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the angular exposure was initially calculated for the batse 1b catalog @xcite , but was not updated because onboard flight recorder failures produced telemetry gaps in the data .",
    "a statistical approach was needed rather than the previous procedure of direct extraction of the exposure information .",
    "the 1b analysis helped in designing this approach , however , as a number of important considerations were identified :    * zeroth order exposure is due to experimental livetime ( burst detection is impossible if high voltage is off or if onboard triggers are disabled ) . *",
    "the first order exposure effect is sky blockage by the earth , which introduces a quadrupole moment in the coverage such that bursts are less - easily detected in the equatorial plane . *",
    "second order exposure effects are a dipole moment and quadrupole moments altered by the saa and trigger disable boxes .",
    "small right ascension - dependent exposure components result from cgro s 52-day precession period , but these components have been found to be small for batse catalogs since these span more than one precession cycle .",
    "other higher - order effects have also been omitted because they are small .",
    "calculation of the angular exposure proceeds as follows :    * a cgro orbital model is used to step the satellite through 30-second positional increments during the batse catalog in question .",
    "inclusive dates of specific batse catalogs are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "+ .batse catalog start and end times . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     there are a number of differences between published 1b results @xcite and the 1b results presented here .",
    "these results affect many subsequently - published batse exposure estimates which were based on the 1b exposure .",
    "the most significant differences are as follows :    * the original 1b calculation considered livetime to include only times when the trigger threshold was @xmath0 in energy channels @xmath1 .",
    "this left as deadtime intervals when the trigger threshold was @xmath2 and @xmath3 . by including these other triggering times in the new calculation ,",
    "the overall 1b exposure ( 0.425 ) is greater than was previously estimated ( 0.355 ) . *",
    "the original 1b calculation sampled the sky only on 5 minute intervals . by not interpolating the spacecraft position , the angular size of the saa box",
    "was overestimated , producing a larger dipole moment ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and more pronounced quadrupole moments ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) than those found via the new algorithm .",
    "we have compared the results of the new algorithm over one 52-day precession cycle to that calculated from the untriggered burst search @xcite .",
    "the untriggered burst search uses different triggering criteria , no trigger disable boxes , and a lower detection threshold than batse s onboard triggers .",
    "although the general exposure properties identified by the new batse exposure algorithm and the untriggered burst search are in agreement , there are significant ( but easily understood ) differences between them :    * the overall angular exposure found from the untriggered burst search is larger than that found using the onboard batse triggers because the lack of trigger disable boxes produces more livetime . *",
    "the untriggered burst search has significantly larger dipole and quadrupole moments than those found using the onboard batse triggers , which again results from the lack of trigger disable boxes .",
    "there have been significantly more particle events detected while the spacecraft was over the southern hemisphere @xcite , so that an experiment such as the untriggered burst search is more sensitive than the triggered batse experiment towards southern hemisphere observations .",
    "estimated uncertainties in the exposure fractions are less than 4% .",
    "possible sources of systematic error in the moments are currently under study , but are expected to be less than 0.003 for the galactic moments .",
