    "the inelastic cross section is readily calculated numerically in the general case , but the result becomes less transparent due to the complication that the @xmath15 and @xmath73 modes are coupled whenever the propagation vector has a non - zero component in the @xmath26 plane .",

    "this degree of freedom has been fixed by a fitting to the susceptibility .",
    "the present model accounts very well for the susceptibility , whereas the use of , for instance , the exchange parameters proposed by loire _ et al._@xcite leads to values for the susceptibility , which are about 25% larger than the experimental ones ( 40% in the single - spin mf approximation ) at temperatures close to @xmath140 .",
    "the mf - cluster calculation also predicts a quantum reduction of the ordered moment , from 5 to 4.7 @xmath227 .",
    "this reduction is less pronounced than the one derived from experiments , as the value of the ordered moment determined from neutron - diffraction experiments at 2 k by marty _",
    "et al._@xcite was found to be as small as about 4 @xmath227 .",
    "although the trimerized states of the fe spin triangles differ greatly from that determined by fully polarized spins , the linear spin - wave theory works surprisingly well demonstrating the effectiveness of the boson representation obtained by , for instance , the holstein  primakoff transformation .",

    "the particular model derived by loire _",

    "their characterization of the different spin - wave modes may be imprecise , but their main conclusions are the same as derived here . in the crystal they investigated",
    "the crystallographic chirality is @xmath20 , the ordered moments in the triangles have the orientation specified by @xmath24 , and the spiraling ordered moments along a line parallel to the @xmath15 axis are making a righthanded helix corresponding to @xmath38 .",
    "the mirroring of the present system with respect to , for instance , the @xmath228 plane through @xmath229 would change the structural chirality @xmath230 from @xmath231 to @xmath232 , and the helicity @xmath179 from @xmath232 to @xmath231 , whereas the sign of @xmath233 and @xmath24 would remain unchanged .",
    "the choice between the two possible orientations of the ordered spin triangles is determined by the local surroundings not by the structural chirality . by definition chirality",
    "should be invariant with respect to time reversal but have odd parity with respect to inversion.@xcite based on this definition , the orientation of the spin triangles denoted by @xmath234 can not be characterized as a chiral property .    to summarize : the asymmetry between the inelastic intensities of magnetic scattered unpolarized neutrons at @xmath235 and @xmath236 or at @xmath235 and @xmath237 , as observed , respectively , by loire _",
    "et al._@xcite and by stock _",

    "( [ e01 ] ) , due to the spin - orbit interaction , couples chirality in spin space to the crystallographic chirality , @xmath239 .",
    "the sign of the dm anisotropy determines the choice between the two possible orientations of the ordered moments in the fe triangles , and it is found that @xmath240 .",
    "the combination of an enantiopure crystal and a non - zero dm anisotropy implies that the system only contains ordered moments with a single sense of helicity , that @xmath241 in this system where @xmath27 is positive .",
    "the dynamics of the present system is unique , not because the spin waves have chiral properties but because the presence of only one domain of helicity has made it possible to observed this intrinsic dynamic property .",
    "it may be concluded that the three different modes of spin waves propagating along the @xmath15 axis in the ba@xmath0nbfe@xmath0si@xmath1o@xmath2 crystal investigated by loire _",
    "et al._@xcite should all posses , depending on their effective propagation vector @xmath242 , the same or the opposite sense of helicity as the ordered structure .",
    "the observed behavior of the @xmath15 mode is in agreement with this conclusion , whereas the near degeneracy of the @xmath73 modes starting out from the nuclear bragg points prevents an experimental determination of the chiral properties of these modes .",
