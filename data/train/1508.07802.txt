    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and star - forming regions show prominent emission lines of heavy elements that can be easily measured , even for objects at large redshifts .",
    "the intensity of these emission lines depends on the metallicity , which makes them convenient tracers of the chemical evolution of the universe .",
    "the abundance of a given element in agns and in star - forming regions can be derived from measurements of the relative strengths of the emission lines of its ions and of the electron temperature and density of the gas @xcite .",
    "oxygen has been generally used as tracer of the metallicity ( @xmath3 ) of star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of agns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "methods for the abundance determinations in star - forming regions have been discussed in many papers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the consensus is that _ bona - fide _ determinations of @xmath3 are only obtained by using the @xmath4-method @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the determination of the electron temperature ( @xmath4 ) from the ratios between intensities of two emission lines originating in transitions from two levels with different excitation energies of a same ion , such as the ratios [ ] ( @xmath54959+@xmath55007)/@xmath54363 , [ ] ( @xmath59069+@xmath59532)/@xmath56312 , and [ ] ( @xmath56548+@xmath56584)/@xmath55755 ( see @xcite . ) unfortunately , these line ratios can not easily be measured in distant objects and/or in objects with low excitation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , preventing the use of the @xmath4-method .    therefore , the oxygen abundances in hii regions are usually estimated using the strong - line method pioneered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the principal idea of the strong - line method is to establish the relation between the ( oxygen ) abundance in an hii region and some combination of the intensities of strong emission lines in its spectrum , i.e. , the position of the objects in the strong - line diagram is calibrated in terms of abundance .",
    "therefore such a relation is often called a `` calibration '' .",
    "the calibrations of strong emission lines in terms of the oxygen abundances can be accomplished by three methods : ( i ) theoretical calibrations based on photoionization models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( ii ) empirical calibrations based on hii regions with abundances derived through the @xmath4-method ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) , and ( iii ) hybrid calibrations where both photoionization models and hii regions with @xmath6-based abundances are used as calibration data points @xcite .",
    "the metallicity scales produced by these different methods may differ from each other by up 0.7 dex @xcite .",
    "here we use the metallicity scale in hii regions defined by the abundances determined through the classical @xmath6-method .",
    "this is because in the @xmath6 method the physical conditions in the nebulae , which are essential ingredients in order to calculate the abundance , are derived directly from observations . otherwise , if the physical conditions and consequently the abundances are derived by models they will be less certain .",
    "this is because of the parameters of the model such as the ionizing source , geometry , etc . , tend not to be sufficiently realistic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "agn metallicities are usually estimated through strong - line theoretical calibrations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "even solar or supersolar abundances have been found .",
    "@xcite established a sequence of photoionization models to reproduce the narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) of agn spectra and found that models with a metallicity of @xmath7 provide the best agreement with the observational data .",
    "@xcite used the photoionization models to analyse the emission lines in the spectra of the nlrs from the sloan digital sky survey ( see @xcite ) and found supersolar metallicities for typical seyfert galaxies ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "high metallicities at the centres of spiral galaxies are also obtained by the extrapolation of radial abundance gradients to the central regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "in contrast , low metallicities in agns have been obtained when the @xmath4 method was used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the disagreement between the abundances obtained through the strong - line methods and through the @xmath4-method is the so - called `` temperature problem '' .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite determined the abundances through the @xmath4-method in the agns in four dwarf galaxies and found metallicities between 0.05 and 0.2 of the solar value , which is a typical abundance of those galaxies .",
    "@xcite , also using the @xmath4-method , estimated the abundance in the seyfert 2 nucleus of the galaxy eso138g1 classified as e / s0 @xcite and found @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the @xmath4 method seems to produce realistic abundance estimations in the low metallicity range , i.e. , the temperature problem seems to disappear at low metallicities .",
    "finding the correct method for the determination of agn metallicities and establishing a relation between the agn metallicity and the metallicity of the host galaxy are very important challenges .",
    "it should be noted that the agn metallicity is sometimes adopted as a surrogate metallicity of the host galaxy , mainly at high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays , a large number of measured intensities of emission lines sensitive to the electron temperature are available for agns in the literature .",
    "this also holds for determinations of oxygen gradients in a large sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "this provides the possibility for an analysis of the metallicity determinations in agns .",
    "the main goals of the current study are : ( i ) to investigate the discrepancy between agn abundances derived through the strong - line methods and through the @xmath4 method .",
    "the magnitude of this discrepancy is well known for star - forming regions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) , however , this problem has received less attention in the case of the nlrs of agns .",
    "( ii ) to compare the abundances of the nlrs of agns and nuclear star - forming regions estimated from their spectra and central oxygen abundances of the host galaxies derived from the radial abundance gradients .",
    "differences between these values could be evidence in favour of the existence of gas infall onto the center of a galaxy or extraordinary chemical enrichment of these objects .",
    "the present study is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we compare the nlr abundances determined through the @xmath6-method and the strong emission - line relations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sb98 ) .",
    "we examine the relation between the abundances in the nlrs estimated from their optical emission - line spectra and the central intersect abundances in the host galaxies determined from the radial abundance gradients in section 3 .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "intensities of narrow emission lines of agns were compiled from the literature .",
    "our selection criterion was the presence of flux measurements of the narrow optical emission lines [ ] @xmath53727 , [ ] @xmath54363 , h@xmath9 , [ ] @xmath55007 , h@xmath10 , [ ] @xmath56584 , and [ ] @xmath116717,6731 .",
    "we only considered galaxies whose nuclei were classified as seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) and sy1.9 .",
    "sequences of photoionization models , not including the shock gas but only a power law radiation of the ionizing source , are able to reproduce measurements of strong narrow emission lines of sy2 and sy1.9 for a large spectral range ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the selection of these agn types minimises the effects of shock gas excitations and ionizations , which are not considered in our abundance determinations .",
    "we list in table  [ tab1 ] the identification of the objects , the emission - line intensities ( relative to h@xmath9=1.0 ) , the spectral classification taken from the ned , and bibliographic references from which the data were taken .",
    "the sample consists of 47 local agns ( redshift @xmath12 ) observed with long - slit spectroscopy . in the cases where the reddening correction was not performed in the original works ( indicated in table .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) , we dereddened the emission - lines comparing the observed h@xmath10/h@xmath9 ratio with the theoretical value of 2.86 @xcite , obtained for an electron temperature of 10000 k and an electron density of @xmath13 .",
    "the emission - line flux errors are reported in the original works for only 4 out of the 47 objects of our sample .",
    "therefore the errors are not given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "typical errors of the emission - line intensities are about 10 to 20 per cent ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which yield uncertainties in the oxygen abundance estimations of about 0.1 to 0.2 dex ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hereafter we will assume that the oxygen estimations from the @xmath6-method and the relations by sb98 have an uncertainty of 0.15 dex , an average of the values above .",
    "for the objects which the flux of the line [ ] @xmath54959 is not available , this was calculated from the theoretical relation @xmath14[]@xmath54959=@xmath14[]@xmath55007/3.0 .

    "are reported in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the oxygen abundances of some objects can not be determined through the relations given by sb98 because for those objects the estimated abundances or electron densities are outside of the validity ranges considered by these authors , i.e. , beyond of the range of values for which the relations are defined .",
    "the electron densities , @xmath15 , for the objects in our sample were computed from the line intensity ratio [ ] @xmath16 using the temden routine of the nebular package of iraf .",
    "most of our objects have values in the range @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "these values are somewhat higher than the ones derived for regions , which were found to be @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , they are sufficiently low so that one does not need to consider the contribution from the collisional de - excitation @xcite or the direct recombination of the forbidden lines used in the standard abundance determinations .",
    "we found the electron temperature @xmath20 to be in the range of 6000 to 50000 k , with an average value of @xmath120000 k. this value is somewhat higher than the one found by @xcite for sy2s , who used data from sdss dr7 and found an average value of 14000 k.    fig .",
    "[ f4 ] shows the comparison between oxygen abundances in nlrs determined through the two methods presented above .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ f4 ] reveals that the @xmath4-method provides oxygen abundances lower than the ones obtained via the relations of sb98 by up to @xmath12dex , with an average value of @xmath2 dex , which confirms the existence of the so - called `` temperature problem '' in agns .",
    "this discrepancy is much larger than the one found for regions .",
    "for example , @xcite , using spectroscopy data of regions in spiral galaxies , found that o / h abundances computed from relations based on photoionization models of @xcite are higher by 0.2 to 0.5 dex than the ones from the @xmath4-method .",
    "the abundance discrepancy in agns could be caused by the presence of a secondary heating ( ionizing ) source in addition to the radiation from the gas accretion onto the agn .",
    "this secondary source is probably related to the shock .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that the strong [ ] @xmath54363 flux in agns ( and consequently high electron temperature ) suggests the presence of some supplementary energy source(s ) , which could be due to the presence of shock waves ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of fluctuations of electron temperature @xcite in the gas phase of agns could also contribute for the discrepancies found in fig .",

    "we consider two models to reproduce the observational data : ( i ) the agn model to describe the nrl spectra , and ( ii ) the sf+agn model to describe composite ( star - forming regions + agn ) spectra .",
    "we use the version 08.00 of the cloudy code @xcite to construct nlr models similar to the ones used by @xcite , but considering the table - agn model @xcite as the ionizing source .",
    "we considered a large range of values for the physical parameters : the number of ionizing photons , @xmath23 ; electron densities , @xmath24 ; and metallicities , @xmath25 .",
    "the spectrum of the sf+agn model is the sum of the predictions of the sf model and the agn model .",
    "the sf model is constructed using the cloudy code @xcite assuming the ionizing source to be a stellar cluster with an age of 2.5 myr and @xmath26 whose spectrum is computed with the @xmath27 code @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of the gas phase was considered to be solar with an electron density @xmath28 .",
    "these parameters are similar to the ones derived in circumnuclear star - formation regions observed in two galaxies ( ngc1097 and ngc6951 ) containing a seyfert 2 nucleus by @xcite .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ f2ac ] that the ratio [ ] @xmath54363/h@xmath9 is underpredicted by the agn and sf+agn models when compared the observations .",
    "this line ratio depends strongly on the electron temperature , therefore the electron temperatures in agns predicted by our models are lower than the ones estimated using the @xmath4-method .",
    "thus , this discrepancy could be attributed to the presence of gas shock waves propagating at supersonic velocities through the nlrs , which does to enhance the intensity of [ ] @xmath54363 producing larger electron temperature values and , consequently , low ( unrealistic ) o / h values when using the @xmath4-method ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    due to the result above",

    "instead of doing that we use our models to choose which of the relations by sb98 yields more reliable abundances .",
    "for that , we use the standard o / h  @xmath21 empirical diagram .",
    "the @xmath21 parameter was suggested by @xcite as indicator of the oxygen abundance when the @xmath4-method can not be applied .",
    "although @xmath21 has a strong dependence on metallicity , it also depends on the ionization degree of the nebulae , which should be taken into account @xcite .",

    "the abundances in the nlrs of agns taken from the list of @xcite are in the range @xmath48 or @xmath49 , which does not exceed the maximum attainable abundance for galaxies .",
    "this suggests that there is no an extraordinary chemical enrichment of the nlrs .",
    "similar agn abundances were obtained by @xcite from the analysis of the civ@xmath51549/heii@xmath51640 ",
    "ciii]@xmath51909/civ@xmath51549 diagram calibrated in terms of gas abundance through photoionization models using the cloudy code @xcite .",
    "@xcite also obtained similar abundances using a new index ( c@xmath50 = log[(civ@xmath51549 + ciii]@xmath51909)/heii@xmath51640 ] ) defined by them as a metallicity indicator for agns .",
    "however , it should be noted that we found metallicities larger than twice solar up to @xmath51 [ @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ] ) for five agns from table [ tab1 ] .",
    "similarly extra high metallicities for some nlrs were obtained by sb98 .",
    "further study of the galaxies with possible extra high metallicity agns should be carried out ( in particular , radial abundance distributions and central intersect abundances should be obtained in those galaxies ) in order to be able to draw solid conclusions about the upper limit to the oxygen abundances in nlrs .",
    "we compiled from the literature a sample of spectra of narrow - line regions of active galactic nuclei with available optical emission lines : [ ] @xmath53727 , [ ] @xmath54363 , h@xmath9 , [ ] @xmath55007 , h@xmath10 , [ ] @xmath56584 , [ ] @xmath56717 , and [ ] @xmath56731 .",
    "we estimated the oxygen abundances in those nlrs through the classic @xmath0 method and through the strong - line method ( the calibration of @xcite ) .",
    "we found that the abundances determined through the @xmath0 method are lower by up to @xmath12 dex than the abundances estimated through the calibration of sb98 , i.e. , we confirmed the existence of the so - called `` temperature problem '' in agns .",
    "we also considered a second sample of galaxies for which the emission - line spectra of the central regions were measured by @xcite and the central intersect abundances were found by @xcite .",
    "the direct central abundances of the agns and star - forming regions in those galaxies were estimated through the calibration of @xcite and through the @xmath34 method @xcite , respectively .",
    "we found that the abundances of the nlrs and hii - like objects estimated from the direct spectral measurements are close to or slightly lower than the central intersect abundances obtained from the radial abundance gradients .",
    "this may suggest that the infall of the low - metallicity gas onto the centers of the galaxies can take place in some galaxies where the central abundance estimated from the direct spectral measurements is lower than the central intersect abundance .",
    "the abundances in the nlrs of the agns in our samples do not suggest that there is an extraordinary chemical enrichment of the narrow - line regions .",
    "there are only a few agns with oxygen abundances higher than the maximum attainable abundance for galaxies ( @xmath12 times the solar value ; * ? ? ?",
