    "driven electrophoretically into a nanopore drilled in a membrane , dna molecules exhibit a complex behavior in translocation experiments @xcite .",
    "numerous works have focused on the threading stage of the translocation process @xcite , and another handful have studied the capture of the dna into the pore before it begins to pass through @xcite .",
    "experiments @xcite have observed an initial significant increase followed by saturation of the capture rate with dna length .",
    "the capture rate monotonously increases with the applied voltage , but the character of this increase is different for weak and strong applied voltages .    an explanation of the observed features was suggested in refs . @xcite with the participation of one of us ( a. y. g. ) . although successful in several respects , it involved at one point a tentative _ ad hoc _ assumption of nearly complete suppression of electro - osmotic flow through the dna coil when it came to the proximity of the membrane .",
    "following up on this point , we have improved this consideration in our accompanying work @xcite and shown that while considerable , the suppression of electro - osmosis by the membrane is far from complete .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is now to examine the implications of that finding for the interpretation of the capture experiments @xcite .",
    "we show that the correctly calculated suppression of electro - osmosis is sufficient to explain the data and that it also provides a detailed account of possible regimes and their crossover .",
    "in addition , our theory yields a prediction that upon lowering the applied voltage , the dna length dependence of the capture rate first disappears and eventually reverses so that the capture becomes a decreasing function of the dna length .",
    "after a short description of the translocation experiment , in the first part of this article , we present a reminder of our accompanying work regarding the dna electrophoresis for a coil placed near a pore and of previous works regarding the capture theory @xcite .",
    "we then revisit the capture problem by viewing the distance of the dna end from the pore entrance as a single relevant reaction coordinate .",
    "although the applicability of this reaction coordinate is obvious while the coil is far from the pore and can be treated as a point - like object , we argue that it remains marginally applicable up until the dna end touches the pore .",
    "we then compute the free energy landscape which is determined by the entropy of a dna coil near a membrane as well as its electrophoretic pull near and far from a pore .",
    "the two different regimes of the capture process introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite naturally appear as two limits of this consideration .",
    "the setup of a translocation experiment is schematically shown in figure [ setup ] .",
    "an electrolyte dilute solution of dna molecules is separated by a dielectric membrane into a _",
    "cis _ and _ trans _ part . upon the application of an external voltage to the apparatus",
    ", the charged dna molecules are drawn towards a very nanometer - sized pore drilled in the membrane , and pass through the pore from the _ cis _ to the _ trans _ side of the membrane . the electric field which drives this process is not subject to debye screening , as it is maintained by an electric current driven by the voltage through the conducting medium and the pore and in this sense",
    ", it is the result of a steady but not equilibrium process .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , far enough from the apparatus walls , the electric field has a spherical geometry and is like that of a point charge , with a potential @xmath1 as a function of the distance @xmath2 from the pore , valid at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pore width .",
    "the effective `` pore charge '' is @xmath5 , where for simplicity , the total applied voltage @xmath6 sits in the place of the voltage drop across the pore which depends linearly on @xmath6 .",
    "the non - uniform field @xmath7 created by the applied voltage facilitates the dna capture into the pore by electrophoretically attracting the dna towards the pore ; this effect , which we have studied in detail in our accompanying work @xcite is summarized below .     inside the electrolyte and electrophoretically drives the dna molecules towards and through the pore . the electric field is like one produced by a point charge @xmath8 which is determined by the pore dimensions and the applied voltage , is almost uniform along the dna molecules far from the pore , and is highly non - uniform for the molecules close to or captured in the pore . [ setup ] ]      biasing the ion concentrations , the contour of a dna coil is effectively surrounded by a thin layer of positively charged liquid , which opposes the dna motion upon the application of an electric field @xmath9 .",
    "this reduces the effective electrophoretic pull , which is often characterized using the force necessary to stall the dna against the electric field @xmath10 the stall force @xmath11 depends on @xmath9 through an effective charge @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the standard mechanical mobility and @xmath14 is the well - known length independent electrophoretic mobility @xcite , in which , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the dna width and charge per unit chain length , @xmath17 is the solvent viscosity and @xmath18 is the electric screening radius , understood often in the context of debye theory . using the linear relation between the electro - osmotic flow and the electric field , and the same @xmath19 decay of the electric and velocity field with the distance @xmath2 from the pore , we have obtained in @xcite the stall force per dna segment for a coil captured from one end into the pore to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the kuhn segment length and the effective charge per segment is @xmath22 , with @xmath23 formally viewed as the mechanical mobility of a single segment at @xmath2 , inversely proportional to the friction coefficient per segment @xmath24 in a blob of size @xmath2 .",
    "the stall force in eq ( [ stall force per segment ] ) characterizes the viscous suppression ( by electro - osmotic flow ) of the bare electric pull ; its increase at small @xmath2 indicates the natural weakening of the counterflow in the vicinity of the membrane .",
    "equation ( [ stall force per segment ] ) is valid for voltages which are not strong enough to significantly deform the dna ; this corresponds to @xmath25 or smaller , with the dimensionless parameter @xmath26 defined as @xmath27 representing the strength of the electric field relative to thermal energy @xmath28 .",
    "this turns out to be the conditions under which experiments @xcite have been performed . for @xmath29 ,",
    "the dna is highly compressed and concentration blobs form ( see our accompanying work @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .      here",
    "we briefly summarize the theoretical ideas of the works @xcite that we use here to highlight the places where improvements are necessary .",
    "_ non - interacting dna molecules : _ for a sufficiently dilute solution of dna molecules , each molecule is captured into the pore independently of the others and therefore , the capture rate is liner in the bulk dna concentration @xmath30 and is equal to @xmath31 .",
    "it is this quantity @xmath32 that is usually measured in experiments , which for brevity is called the capture rate .",
    "we will consider the same quantity in our analysis below .",
    "_ quasiequilibrium dna energy landscape : _ the way the dna capture is facilitated by the electric field can be formulated in terms of its energy landscape in the potential field @xmath33 introduced above .",
    "assuming that the dna does not contribute significantly to the electric current which maintains the electric field @xmath34 , its presence does not affect the potential @xmath33 . under this assumption",
    ", the dna can be considered as moving in a potential field @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the work of the stall force on the dna coil as it is delivered quasistatically from infinity to the distance @xmath2 from the pore and can be written as @xmath37 .",
    "equation ( [ w formula ] ) is only valid for @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the coil size , where field variations across the dna coil are small and thus the coil can be considered as a point - like particle .",
    "_ diffusion versus barrier limited regimes : _ capture of a dna coil into a pore occurs through an interplay between the dna diffusion far from the pore and the electrophoretic dna drift close to the pore , and takes place in two different regimes . in the `` barrier - limited '' regime , the dna molecules which arrive at the pore face an entropic barrier , which takes many attempts to overcome and is the rate limiting factor in the capture rate . in the `` diffusion - limited '' regime , the entropic barrier is mostly flattened by the electrophoretic pull and the limiting factor is the rate at which dna molecules arrive diffusively to a capture radius @xmath40 from the pore .",
    "_ diffusion - limited regime : _ for sufficiently large applied voltages and dna lengths , the rate limiting process is the diffusive arrival of the dna coils to a capture radius @xmath40 introduced below , in which case , the process can be described by the classical smoluchowski theory for diffusive particle absorption @xcite with a rate @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the diffusion - limited rate , @xmath43 is the coil diffusion coefficient , and the coefficient @xmath44 instead of the familiar @xmath45 appears because the dna is captured in a half space only .",
    "the capture radius @xmath46 , the distance at which dna free diffusion at large distances crosses over to the electrophoretic drift down the potential @xmath33 , can be found from the condition @xmath47 ( using the units in which the boltzmann constant equals @xmath48 and @xmath28 is the thermal energy ) to be @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dna length independent electrophoretic mobility .",
    "this yields a dna length independent diffusion - limited capture rate @xmath42 for large dna length @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , this result , based on considering the dna coil as a point - like particle , is only valid as long as @xmath51 , where @xmath39 is the coil size . for the parameters of the experiment @xcite",
    ", it was estimated @xcite that the ratio @xmath52 , which means the theory is at the border of applicability .",
    "the ratio @xmath53 is the same as the dimensionless electric field parameter @xmath26 introduced in the next section ( eq ( [ parameter u ] ) ) .",
    "_ barrier - limited regime : _ in the opposite limit , the rate limiting process is overcoming the pore entrance barrier . in this regime ,",
    "the dna coil arrives many times at the pore entrance before it finally succeeds in placing its end into the pore and beginning to thread .",
    "therefore , there is almost an equilibrium between the dna at the pore and in the bulk . for the dna to introduce its end into the pore",
    ", the coil has to overcome a free - energy barrier and , therefore , the capture process in this regime can be viewed as overcoming a barrier , whose rate , using kramers theory @xcite , is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the attempt rate ( with units @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 is the barrier height .",
    "the barrier height decreases with the electric field .",
    "this decrease is of a subtle nature , as when the dna is at the pore , it is subject to a very non - uniform electric field and the electro - osmotic flow is affected by the proximity of the membrane . to describe this , a tentative _ ad hoc _",
    "assumption was made in @xcite that @xmath58 in this situation was close to the bare dna charge and thus linear in the dna length @xmath0 . although this allowed to explain the increase of the capture rate with @xmath0 for moderate values of @xmath0 , the arbitrary character of this assumption called for improvement .",
    "this in fact is the main purpose of an accompanying work @xcite , where we show that the assumption @xmath59 while sufficient to account for the existing data , is far too bold and results in an overestimation of the dna energy at the pore .",
    "other aspects of the capture theory , namely , the size - dependent conformational and orientational entropic cost of bringing the dna end into the pore , and a clear characterization of the crossover between the barrier - limited and diffusion - limited regimes , were also not considered in the previous works ; they will be considered in the present work .",
    "taking the same approach as in @xcite , we model the problem as a steady state particle absorption process , in which , dna molecules are provided far from the pore with a constant flux @xmath60 , with @xmath30 the dna concentration far from the pore and @xmath32 the capture rate , and are absorbed as they get captured into the pore , through which , the same flux @xmath61 of molecules passes .",
    "any successful capture event involves the arrival of a dna molecule to a position of low enough free energy with respect to its starting points far from the pore , which makes that event practically an irreversible event and the pore a sink for the dna molecules .",
    "the rate at which the dna molecules are captured ( into the sink , or the pore ) , as pointed out by @xcite @xcite , is characterized by the concentration profile of those molecules ; far from the pore , where the dna can be considered as a point - like particle , the dna concentration @xmath62 satisfies the smoluchowski equation @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the free energy landscape .",
    "the applicability of eq ( [ total current ] ) is obvious far from the pore , where the coil can be viewed as a point - like object and @xmath65 can be the distance of any part of the coil from the pore entrance . when the coil approaches the pore , we must specify what variable to use as a reaction coordinate to account for the dynamics of the system .",
    "we found the following very simple idea useful .",
    "let us define @xmath2 as the distance of the dna end from the pore entrance ; we ignore for the time being the fact that there are two ends .",
    "this choice of coordinate is a reasonable and simple single - variable measure of how close to the state of being captured from one end the coil is ; since the relaxation time of the end as it diffuses a distance comparable to the coil size within the coil remains of the same order as the relaxation time of the coil , @xmath2 is marginally applicable as a single reaction coordinate which approximately describes how the different states between a coil merely sitting at the pore and captured from one end are explored by the coil .",
    "for the same reason and as another manifestation of this marginal applicability , we assume that the effective diffusion constant remains unchanged as the system evolves along @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is certainly not exact , but remains at the margin of applicability as the end approaches the pore , and so must yield the right scaling results .",
    "the steady state absorption problem formulated using the smoluchowski equation ( [ total current ] ) must be equipped with an absorbing boundary condition @xmath66 , imposed at the barrier peak @xmath67 which corresponds to the dna end touching the pore . imposing this condition",
    ", we find @xmath68 which can be used to obtain the rate @xmath32 by letting the total number of particles in the system of volume @xmath69 be equal to @xmath70 and thus @xmath71\\mathrm{d}r.\\label{total particles}\\ ] ]      in this subsection , we calculate the free energy landscape @xmath64 of the dna as a function of the reaction coordinate @xmath2 , which consists of an electrophoretic part and an entropic cost imposed on a dna with one end held in the pore . here is an overall glimpse of @xmath64 , as also sketched in fig .",
    "[ free energy ] .",
    "starting from zero far from the pore , @xmath72 [ eq . ( [ w formula ] ) ] decreases smoothly for @xmath73 and reaches a local minimum @xmath74 as it arrives at the pore . from this minimum",
    ", one dna end can be brought to the pore .",
    "such a motion would involve an energetic gain @xmath75 and an entropy cost @xmath76 and therefore , the free energy would be @xmath77 for @xmath78 . as we will discuss in the end in more details , @xmath79 reaches its maximum at @xmath80 , which is the top of the free energy barrier and corresponds to one dna end held near the pore .",
    "the next few paragraphs are devoted to the derivation of the free energy near the pore , i.e. for the reaction coordinate @xmath78 .",
    "let us first calculate the entropy @xmath81 of introducing one dna end into the pore .",
    "@xmath82 contains a conformational term @xmath83 and a term @xmath84 related to the orientational freedom of the end .",
    "the conformational term appears when the dna end is brought to a distance @xmath85 from the pore ; during this step , the conformational freedom of the coil is reduced to that of a flexible polymer grafted from one end to a solid membrane .",
    "the resulting entropic cost is @xmath86 , where the constant @xmath87 is related to the entropic exponents appearing while counting the number of polymer conformations far from ( @xmath88 ) and near ( @xmath89 ) a surface @xcite . more generally , bringing the dna to a distance @xmath90 from the pore results in @xmath91 ; this relation could be understood by rescaling the segment size from @xmath21 to @xmath2 .",
    "the coil end must be oriented in such a way that it can enter the pore ; this orientation begins to occur when the first dna segment ( counted from its end ) is at a distance @xmath21 from the pore and costs an amount @xmath84 .",
    "let us remember that the kuhn length @xmath21 for dsdna is much larger than the pore dimensions and therefore , entering the pore results in a rotational restriction of the captured end , reducing the total @xmath45 solid angle available to a free end to an amount @xmath92 , where @xmath4 and @xmath93 are pore dimensions .",
    "this results in an entropy cost @xmath94 .",
    "the change of the reaction coordinate upon the entrance of the coil end into the pore is very small and on the order of the microscopic length scale @xmath21 of the coil .",
    "we now obtain the energetic part of the free energy @xmath75 by first calculating the work of the stall force as one dna end is brought from within the coil to a distance @xmath85 from the pore .",
    "for this to happen , the coil is pulled in such a way that any segment indexed @xmath95 with respect to the captured end is brought to a distance @xmath96 from the pore , required for a polymer grafted from one end to a surface @xcite . during this motion , on average ,",
    "@xmath97 segments are brought from a distance @xmath98 to @xmath2 from the pore and placed in a shell of thickness @xmath99 .",
    "this motion occurs while liquid flows through and around the coil and therefore , the work of stall force performed on a single segment brought from @xmath39 to @xmath2 is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is found by substituting @xmath102 in eq ( [ stall force per segment ] ) . summing over all the segments , we obtain @xmath103 a scaling argument similar to the one used above for obtaining @xmath104 will suggest here that @xmath105 for @xmath90 .",
    "let us note that the electrophoretic mobility is independent of segment size ; therefore , since the integration in eq .",
    "( [ wb formula ] ) is dominated by the upper bound and thus the energetic gain is determined just like the entropic loss by the largest scale of the coil , rescaling the segment size from @xmath21 to @xmath2 only affects the argument inside the logarithm .     in the barrier - limited regime as a function of the reaction",
    "coordinate @xmath2 , set to be the position of the dna end with respect to the pore . for @xmath73 , where @xmath39 is the dna coil size",
    ", the free energy is solely determined by the coil s electrophoretic attraction ( eq ( [ w formula ] ) ) and decreases to @xmath74 as the coil is brought to a distance @xmath39 from the pore . for @xmath78 , and as one dna end moves from within the coil towards the pore , the conformational and orientational entropy of the coil also contribute to the free energy ; for the barrier - limited regime , this contribution results in an overall increase @xmath57 in the free energy as the dna end is brought from a distance @xmath98 to @xmath85 , which is the height of the free energy barrier .",
    "the free energy begins to fall again for @xmath106 , as the strong electric field inside the pore performs work on the dna segments which pass through the pore .",
    "[ free energy ] ]    putting now the entropic cost @xmath107 and @xmath108 together , the free energy landscape as a function of the reaction coordinate far from and near the pore is    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is @xmath48 for @xmath106 and @xmath111 for @xmath112 , the constant @xmath113 corresponds to the conformational entropy cost , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 are positive numerical factors appearing in @xmath116 and @xmath117 with the dimensionless effective electric field @xmath26 defined in eq ( [ parameter u ] ) ; we have included @xmath118 explicitly in @xmath119 as a convention for brevity of the expressions below .",
    "the barrier height @xmath120 can then be found as @xmath121 where @xmath122 represents the electrophoretic @xmath108 and conformational @xmath123 parts combined ; @xmath124 corresponds to the case in which the conformational entropy cost of the end capture is fully compensated for by the electrophoretic pull .",
    "as we will see later when we compare our results with experimental data , the conformational and electrophoretic parts make a small contribution to the barrier and the main contribution comes from the orientational term [ the last term in eq .",
    "( [ free energy barrier ] ) ] .",
    "we end this part with two comments about the barrier top which we have proposed to be at @xmath80 .",
    "first , at this level of approximation where the coil dynamics is described by a single reaction coordinate , it can not be determined with certainty at what reaction coordinate the first segment of the coil begins to lose its orientational entropy . however , since a capture attempt in which the first segment comes very close ( such that @xmath125 ) to the pore sideways is very likely to be rejected , it is reasonable to propose that the dominant paths in the capture process are the ones in which the first segment is fairly aligned with the pore axis when it is not closer than a distance @xmath85 from the pore . also , further beyond this point and when the tip of the first segment enters the pore , as we show in our accompanying work @xcite , an extra amount of energy @xmath126 is gained by the coil ; this is the work of the stall force [ eq . ( [ stall force per segment ] ) ] as the tip of one segment is brought inside the pore , and it determines how much the free energy drops as the reaction coordinate @xmath2 decreases from @xmath85 to @xmath127 . both of these observations hint at the plausibility of the proposition that the free energy is peaked around a point @xmath80 .",
    "second , after the dna end is captured and @xmath128 segments have passed through the pore , the coil continues to lose more conformational entropy , known to be @xmath129 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this entropic cost , however , is overcome by the energetic gain of threading which scales linearly with @xmath128 and is @xmath130 ( assuming the field range used in experiments and neglecting the extra complication regarding electrophoresis in a pore as well as the length independent electrostatic cost of holding a dna segment inside the pore @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the free energy beyond the barrier peak @xmath131 decreases and thus , the absorbing boundary condition at the barrier peak is correctly imposed .",
    "we now derive @xmath32 by substituting the free - energy landscape into eq .",
    "( [ total particles ] ) .",
    "this consideration is aimed at finding @xmath32 in different regimes , as summarized by eqs .",

    "[ rc schematic ] . to calculate the integrals in eq ( [ total particles ] )",
    ", we break the one over @xmath132 into two parts .",
    "the first part @xmath133 runs from @xmath21 to @xmath39 , and the second one @xmath134 runs from @xmath39 to @xmath2 ( since the integral over @xmath2 scales with the experimental apparatus volume @xmath69 and is thus dominated by @xmath135 , we will not calculate the inner integral for @xmath78 ) .",
    "we obtain the second integral to be @xmath136 the first one depends on @xmath122 and is    @xmath137    where we have dropped a small term of order @xmath138 in both eqs ( [ inner integral 1 ] ) and ( [ inner integral 2 ] ) and kept the dominant terms ( the last term in eq ( [ inner integral 1 ] ) only begins to become important when @xmath139 ) .",
    "substituting now eqs ( [ second inner integral ] ) , ( [ inner integral 1 ] ) and ( [ inner integral 2 ] ) into eq ( [ total particles ] ) we obtain    @xmath140    equations ( [ inverse rate epsilon>1 ] ) and ( [ inverse rate epsilon<1 ] ) are relations for inverse current or overall resistance , in which , the overall resistance @xmath141 is found as the sum of a barrier resistor and a diffusion resistor connected in series .",

    "using the formulation of the electrophoresis of a dna coil at the pore , we develop a concise model of the capture process in a translocation experiment , which produces the previously observed diffusion - limited and barrier - limited regimes as two different limits separated by a crossover naturally emerging from the solution .",

    "this is that for very large @xmath0 , the system crosses over to the diffusion - limited regime , in which , the capture rate is independent of the dna length .",
    "one way to overcome this difficulty would be to increase the crossover size @xmath166 by lowering the electric field ( while keeping the exponent @xmath232 just above zero ) or by using a deeper pore with a larger ratio @xmath233 ; the effectiveness of both methods , however , is limited . as an alternative",
