    "gaining information regarding the spin of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is essential in order to understand some of the fundamental mechanisms for powering radio jets , galaxy evolution and agn merger histories .",
    "for example , it is thought that the spin of the smbh may be related to powering relativistic jets and it is therefore important to begin to assess the differences between radio - loud and radio - quiet agn ( wilson & colbert 1995 ; moderski et al .",
    "1998 ; mangalam et al . 2009 ) and the intrinsic properties of the smbh and its accretion disc .",
    "similarly , the distribution of smbh spin or the average spin could be an essential tool for distinguishing between various galaxy evolution models ( hughes & blandford 2003 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2005 ; king & pringle 2007 ; rezzolla et al .",
    ". prolonged accretion could result in a large fraction of bhs having a high degree of spin , however , if the majority of agn have more intermediate or low bh spin then spin - alignment during mergers could be the mechanism responsible for spin - ups or the blandford - znajek effect ( the magnetic extraction of bh rotational energy ; blandford & znajek 1977 ) could cause the reduction of bh spin in many agn ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) .    the properties of the smbh and the surrounding accretion disc can be measured through the analysis of the x - ray spectrum of agn since line emission occurring from close to the black hole can become relativistically broadened ( fabian et al . 1989 ; laor 1991 ) .",
    "the shape of such a line profile allows properties such as the emissivity and the inclination of the disc to be determined , in addition to the typical inner radius of emission and the spin of the central black hole ( doviak et al .",
    "2004 ; brenneman & reynolds 2006 ; dauser et al .",
    "these signatures of emission from close to the black hole are most prominent in the neutral fek@xmath3 line at 6.4kev due to the high abundance and fluorescent yield of iron . in order to make the required measurements ( particularly bh spin ) , a robust broad - band spectral model must be formed in order to assess the contribution ( if any ) of relativistically broadened line emission .",
    "recent publications have gone some way towards making tentative spin measurements in agn through the analysis of seyferts lacking significant amounts of intrinsic absorption ( miniutti et al .",
    "2009 ; schmoll et al .",
    "2009 ; patrick et al .",
    "2011 ) , or the analysis of deep observations of more complex agn ( brenneman & reynolds 2006 ; brenneman et al . 2011 ; gallo et al .",
    "2011 ) . as noted in patrick et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the interpretation as to the origin of the soft excess can influence the obtained accretion disc parameters and bh spin . employing a relativistically smeared reflection spectrum from the inner regions of the accretion disc ( e.g. an ionized disc reflection spectrum convolved with a kerr metric",
    "; ross & fabian 2005 ; brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) to model both the soft excess and broadening in the fek region yields results in which the measured parameters differ significantly when they are obtained from either the soft excess or fek region .",
    "this is particularly notable in agn with a strong soft excess , in which case the soft excess is the driving force behind the fit , often leading to typically high spin and emissivity values i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 . as the soft excess is often smooth or featureless , a very high degree of blurring",
    "is required . alternatively employing a comptonization origin of the soft excess ( titarchuk 1994 ) and",
    "seperately measuring these parameters purely from the observed line profile in the fek region yields a more moderate emissivity index and a range of spin values akin to the results found in objects without an observed soft excess i.e. @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( patrick et al . 2011 ) .",
    "it is therefore essential that high quality data sets and deep exposures are used in order to distinguish between these scenarios and measure the true accretion disc parameters independently ."
