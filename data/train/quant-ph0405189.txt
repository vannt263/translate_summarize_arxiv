    "fidelity is a very convenient tool to characterize the stability of quantum computation .",

    "@xmath4 measures the imperfection strength and we assume that the perturbed gates are still unitary .",
    "if the fidelity is close to one , the results of the quantum computation are close to the ideal ones , while , if @xmath5 is significantly smaller than one , then quantum computation does not provide reliable results .",
    "more generally the fidelity ( also called loschmidt echo ) is a quantity of central interest in the study of the stability of dynamical systems under perturbations @xcite .",
    "the decay of fidelity in time exhibits a rich variety of different behaviors , from gaussian to exponential or power - law decay , depending , e.g. , on the chaotic or integrable nature of the system under investigation , on the initial state ( coherent state , mixture , etc . ) , and , for integrable systems , on the shape of the perturbation and on initial conditions .",
    "in particular , in the chaotic , semiclassical regime , and for strong enough perturbations , it has been shown that the decay rate is perturbation independent and determined by the kolmogorov - sinai entropy , related to the lyapunov exponent of classical chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the simulation of the quantum dynamics of models describing the evolution of complex systems promises to become the first application in which a quantum computer with only a few tens of qubits may outperform a classical computer . indeed ,",
    "efficient quantum algorithms simulating the quantum evolution of dynamical systems like the baker s map @xcite , the kicked rotator @xcite , and the sawtooth map @xcite have been found , and important physical quantities could be extracted from these models already with less than 10 qubits @xcite . therefore , these quantum algorithms may constitute the ideal software for short- and medium - term quantum computers operating with a small number of qubits and the most suitable testing ground for investigating the limits to quantum computation due to imperfections and decoherence effects . in this context , we point out that the fidelity of quantum computation has been evaluated for the quantum baker s map using a three - qubit nmr - based quantum processor @xcite",
    ". we also note that efficient quantum algorithms to compute the fidelity have been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    from the viewpoint of computational complexity ,",
    "the following question naturally arises : given a generic dynamical system , is it possible to find its solution at time @xmath6 efficiently , including into consideration unavoidable computational errors ?",
    "we recall that the classical dynamics of chaotic systems is characterized by exponential sensitivity : any amount of error in determining the initial conditions diverges exponentially , with rate given by the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath7 .",
    "this means that , when following a given orbit , one digit of accuracy is lost per suitably chosen unit of time .",
    "therefore , to be able to follow one orbit up to time @xmath6 accurately , we must input @xmath8 bits of information to determine initial conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the orbit of a non - chaotic system is much easier to simulate , since errors only grow linearly with time .",
    "owing to the exponential instability , classical chaotic dynamics is in practice irreversible , as shown by loschmidt echo numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite : if , starting from a given classical distribution in phase space , we simulate the dynamical evolution up to time @xmath6 and then , by inverting at time @xmath6 all the momenta , we follow the backward evolution , we do not recover the initial distribution at time @xmath9 .",
    "this is because any amount of numerical error in computer simulations rapidly effaces the memory of the initial conditions . on the contrary , the same numerical simulations in the quantum case",
    "show that time reversibility is preserved in the presence of small errors .    in view of the above considerations ,",
    "it is natural to inquire whether the degree of stability of a quantum algorithm depends on the nature ( chaotic or non - chaotic ) of the simulated dynamics .",
    "we will show that the decay of the fidelity of a quantum algorithm in the presence of perturbations in the quantum gates is almost independent of the dynamical behavior of the simulated system .    in this paper , we will consider a quantum system , the so - called sawtooth map , which can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer and whose underlying classical dynamics , depending on system s parameters , can be chaotic or non - chaotic .",
    "we will outline the main differences that occur in calculating the fidelity decay with `` classical '' and `` quantum '' perturbations on the dynamical system .",
    "* by _ classical perturbations _ , we mean perturbations of the system s parameters that have a classical limit . for instance , in this paper we perturb , at each map step of the sawtooth model , the kicking strength @xmath10 by a small amount @xmath11 , where @xmath6 measures the number of map iterations .",
    "note that this kind of perturbation , when applied to the classical motion , disturbs a given orbit by a small amount at each map step and therefore , to some extent , mimics the presence of round - off errors in a classical computer .",
    "* by _ quantum perturbations _ , we mean errors introduced at each quantum gate ( in this paper , we consider unitary , memoryless errors ) .",
    "these quantum errors are unavoidable during a quantum computation , due to the imperfect control of the quantum computer hardware and they do not have classical analogue . we will show that the fidelity decay evaluated with quantum errors is not capable of distinguishing between the classically integrable or chaotic nature of the simulated dynamics , being essentially independent of it .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] , we briefly describe the sawtooth map model and a quantum algorithm which efficiently simulates it .",
    "we also introduce our quantum and classical error models and discuss how to efficiently evaluate the fidelity on a quantum computer . in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] , based on extensive numerical simulations , we analyze the differences between the fidelity decay in the presence of classical and quantum error . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in order to illustrate the striking differences between the fidelity decays induced by classical and quantum errors , here we consider the quantum sawtooth map model .",
    "this map is one of the most extensively studied dynamical systems , since it exhibits a rich variety of different dynamical regimes , ranging from integrability to chaos , and interesting physical phenomena like normal and anomalous diffusion , dynamical localization , and cantori localization @xcite .",
    "the sawtooth map is a periodically driven dynamical system , described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the conjugated action - angle variables ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the time evolution @xmath15 of this system is classically described by the map @xmath16 where the bars denote the variables after one map iteration . by rescaling @xmath17 ,",
    "the classical dynamics is seen to depend only on the parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the classical motion is stable for @xmath19 and completely chaotic for @xmath20 and @xmath21 : the maximum lyapunov exponent is @xmath22 $ ] for @xmath21 , @xmath23 for @xmath20 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , in the stable , quasi - integrable regime , the phase space has a complex structure of elliptic islands down to smaller and smaller scales .",

    "we consider hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number of qubits , and set @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , @xmath46 drops to zero exponentially with the number of qubits .",
    "the operator @xmath27 can be written as the product of two operators , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . since @xmath49 is diagonal in the @xmath50 representation , while @xmath51 is diagonal in the @xmath52 representation , the most convenient way to simulate map ( [ quantmap ] ) on a classical computer is based on the forward - backward fast fourier transform between @xmath50 and @xmath52 representations , and requires @xmath53 operations per map iteration . the quantum computation takes advantage of the quantum fourier transform and needs @xmath54 one- and two - qubit gates to accomplish the same task @xcite .",
    "more precisely , it needs @xmath55 hadamard gates and @xmath56 controlled - phase shift gates .",
    "therefore , the resources required to the quantum computer to simulate the evolution of the sawtooth map are only logarithmic in the system size @xmath57 , and there is an exponential speed up , as compared to the best known classical computation .",
    "any experimental realization of a quantum computer has to face the problem of errors , which inevitably set limitations to the accuracy of the implemented algorithms .",
    "these errors can be due to unwanted couplings with the environment or to imperfections in the quantum hardware . in this paper , we limit ourselves to consider _ unitary errors _ , modeled by _",
    "noisy gates_. such noise results from the imperfect control of the quantum computer .",
    "for instance , in a nmr quantum computer the logic gates on qubits are simulated by applying magnetic fields to the system .",
    "if the direction or the intensity of the fields are not correct , a slightly different gate is applied , though it remains unitary . in ion - trap quantum processors ,",
    "laser pulses are used to implement sequences of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in the duration of each pulse induce unitary errors , which accumulate during a quantum computation .    as we have stated above , the implementation of the quantum algorithm for the sawtooth map requires controlled - phase shift and hadamard gates @xcite .",
    "we choose to perturb them as follows .",
    "controlled - phase shift gates are diagonal in the computational basis and act non - trivially only on the four - dimensional hilbert subspace spanned by two qubits . in this subspace , we write each controlled - phase shift gate as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the ideal gate and the diagonal perturbation @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 . therefore , the unitary error operator @xmath60 introduces unwanted phases .",
    "the hadamard gate can be seen as a rotation of the bloch sphere through an angle @xmath62 about the axis @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 . since each one - qubit gate",
    "can be seen as a rotation about some axis @xmath67 , unitary errors tilt the rotation angle : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "hereafter we will call @xmath106 and @xmath107 the fidelity decays induced by classical or quantum errors , respectively .",
    "let us first consider the fidelity decay @xmath106 , obtained under fluctuating perturbations in the parameter @xmath10 of the sawtooth map .",
    "we will show that , under this type of perturbation , the fidelity decay exhibits a marked dependence on the simulated dynamics .",
    "in particular , qualitatively different behaviors are observed depending on the chaotic or non - chaotic motion .",
    "we first consider the _ quasi - integrable regime _ @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the sawtooth map behaves , inside the main integrable island with fixed point @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) as a harmonic oscillator , with characteristic frequency @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , in the semiclassical regime the quantum motion of coherent wave packets residing inside integrable islands closely follows the harmonic evolution of the corresponding classical trajectories . in the central island",
    "this motion has period @xmath110 , while in the outer islands the period is multiplied by a factor which depends on the order of the corresponding resonances ( for example , the two upper islands in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] correspond to a second order resonance , and inside them the period is doubled ) .    since the chosen perturbation affects the parameter @xmath111 , the fidelity @xmath112 is obtained as the overlap of two wave packets which move inside an integrable island with slightly different frequencies . in this case",
    ", we know @xcite that for a static perturbation [ @xmath113 the centers of the two wave packets separate ballistically ( linearly in time ) and a very fast decay of quantum fidelity is expected as far as the distance between the centers of the two packets becomes larger than their width @xmath90 .",
    "the type of decay is related to the shape of the initial wave packet . in particular , for a gaussian wave packet",
    "a gaussian decay is expected .",
    "if @xmath114 denotes the frequency separation between perturbed and unperturbed motion , the gaussian decay takes place after a time @xmath115 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of a randomly fluctuating perturbation @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the frequency @xmath117 of a classical trajectory following the perturbed dynamics is not constant .",
    "the relative displacement of this orbit with respect to the one described by the unperturbed dynamics ( with a frequency @xmath118 ) is approximately given by a brownian motion .",
    "the separation between the two orbits is proportional to the frequency difference @xmath119 . in this case",
    "the fidelity decay is again gaussian , but in general it shows large random fluctuations from the gaussian profile ( see for example the upper curve in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , which depend on the noise realization .",
    "moreover , the distance between the centers of the two wave packets grows @xmath120 , and therefore the gaussian decay starts after a time scale @xmath121 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    moreover , the fidelity decay depends not only on the shape of the initial state , but also on its position .",
    "indeed , inside any integrable island the frequency s perturbation @xmath122 is independent of the position of the wave packet in phase space .",
    "since larger orbits imply a larger velocity , and consequently a larger relative ballistic motion of the two wave packets , the fidelity drops faster when we move far from the center of the integrable islands .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical data ( not shown here ) .    in the _ chaotic regime _",
    ", the fidelity @xmath106 always decays exponentially , and an example of such decay is given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for small perturbations , in the chaotic regime the decay rate @xmath123 , as predicted by the fermi golden rule",
    ". however , if the perturbation is strong enough , the fidelity decay follows a semiclassical regime , in which the decay rate is perturbation independent and equal to the lyapunov exponent of the underlying classical dynamics ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the condition to observe the lyapunov decay is that the perturbation is quantally strong , namely it couples many levels ( @xmath124 ) , but classically weak ( @xmath125 ) .    to summarize ,",
    "the fidelity decay induced by classical perturbations strongly depends on the dynamical regime , chaotic or integrable .",
    "the two qualitatively different behaviors ( exponential or gaussian decay ) are shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "notice also that the regular dynamics turns out to be much more stable than the chaotic one ( to represent both cases on the same figure , the perturbation value chosen in the chaotic case is 20 times smaller than the one chosen in the integrable case ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 7.7 cm    we now analyze the fidelity behavior in the presence of natural errors for quantum computation , namely _ random unitary perturbations _ of amplitude @xmath4 on _ quantum gates _ , following the noise model described in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] .    as sown in figs .",
    "[ fig4]-[fig5 ] , in the _ chaotic regime _ the fidelity @xmath126 drops exponentially , with a rate @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "this decay can be understood from the fermi golden rule : each noisy gate transfers a probability of order @xmath128 from the ideal unperturbed state to other states . due to the fact that perturbations acting on two different gates are completely uncorrelated ,",
    "an exponential decay rate proportional to @xmath128 and to the number of gates @xmath129 required to implement one step of the sawtooth map is expected : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a constant which we have computed from our numerical data .",
    "we have determined the characteristic time scale @xmath132 for fidelity decay from the condition @xmath133 ( note that the value chosen for @xmath84 is not crucial ) .",
    "our numerical calculations , shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] , clearly demonstrate that : @xmath134 in agreement with ( [ fidelitydecay ] ) .",
    "the fidelity decay in the chaotic regime _ always _ follows the exponential behavior predicted by the fermi golden rule .",
    "therefore , in contrast with the case of classical errors , there is no saturation of the decay rate to the largest lyapunov exponent of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this result can be understood from the _ non - locality _ of quantum errors : each noisy gate can make direct transfer of probability on a large distance in phase space .",
    "this is a consequence of the binary encoding of the discretized angle and momentum variables .",
    "for instance , we represent the momentum eigenstates @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) in the computational basis as @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "if we take , say , @xmath140 qubits ( @xmath141 ) , the state @xmath142 corresponds to @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) , @xmath145 to @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) , and so on until @xmath148 , corresponding to @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "let us consider the simplest quantum error , the bit flip : if we flip the less significant qubit ( @xmath151 ) , we exchange @xmath135 with @xmath152 ( mod @xmath57 ) , while , if we flip the most significant qubit ( @xmath153 ) , we exchange @xmath135 with @xmath154 ( mod @xmath57 ) .",
    "it is clear that this latter error transfers probability very far in phase space and can not be reproduced by classical local errors . therefore , no semiclassical regime for the fidelity decay is expected with quantum errors . in particular",
    ", the non locality of perturbations makes the fidelity insensitive to the rate of local exponential instability , given by the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the most striking feature of the fidelity decay induced by quantum errors is that it is substantially independent of the chaotic or non - chaotic nature of the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "an example of this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and strongly contrasts with what obtained by perturbing the system s parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the fidelity decay for integrable dynamics is exponential , as shown in fig .",
    "if we start from a gaussian wave packet , integrable dynamics turns out to be a little more stable than chaotic dynamics : we numerically obtained a ratio of the decay rates in the chaotic and in the integrable case which oscillates between @xmath155 and @xmath156 , for different values of @xmath44 between 5 and 16 , and for various @xmath4 ranging from @xmath157 to @xmath158 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.6 cm    we stress that the smaller decay rate obtained when we evolve a gaussian wave packet inside an integrable island is not due to the lack of exponential instability but simply to the fact that the dynamics preserves the coherence of the wave packet .",
    "this can be clearly seen from the data of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] .",
    "* in the _ chaotic regime _",
    "@xmath21 ( lyapunov exponent @xmath159 ) , the fidelity decay rate is independent of the initial state ( gaussian packet or random state ) and of the rate of exponential instability .",

    "@xmath160 ( lyapunov exponent @xmath24 ) , only in the case in which we choose as initial state a gaussian packet placed inside an integrable island we obtain a fidelity decay rate smaller than in the chaotic case . on the other hand ,",
    "if we start from a random state of if we place the gaussian wave packet inside the anomalously diffusive region , we obtain the same decay rate as in the chaotic case .    from these results , we conclude that the decay rate does not depend on the value of the lyapunov exponent . in short ,",
    "the decay of the fidelity due to noisy gates is _ independent of the presence or lack of exponential instability _",
    "we point out that we have checked that this statement remains valid also for static errors , like in the case in which the dephasing parameters @xmath71 appearing in our noise model are time - independent .",
    "in this paper , we have compared the effects of classical and quantum errors on the stability of quantum motion .",
    "the main result is that , while the fidelity decay under classical errors strongly depends on the dynamical nature of the system under investigation and on initial conditions , quantum errors act in a way essentially independent of the system s dynamics .",
    "this practical insensitivity to the dynamics is eventually a consequence of the intrinsic non locality of the errors that naturally affect the quantum computation . as a consequence , the rich variety of behaviors found in the study of the stability of quantum motion under perturbations of the system s hamiltonian @xcite has no correspondence in the fidelity of quantum computation under its natural perturbations .",
    "the stability of quantum computation is essentially independent of the chaotic or integrable behavior of the simulated dynamics .",
    "this conclusion is simply based on the non locality of quantum errors and therefore we expect that it remains valid also in the case of non - unitary quantum noise and/or when errors , correlated or memoryless , act not only on the qubits on which we apply a quantum gate but on all the qubits that constitute the quantum computer .",
