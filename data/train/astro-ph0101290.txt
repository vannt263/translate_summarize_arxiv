    "stars : individual ( @xmath0 eridani)- stars : late - type - stars : coronae - line : identification - line : profiles",
    "ultraviolet spectra of cool dwarf stars observed with the international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) and the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) show emission lines formed in stellar chromospheres and transition regions at temperatures of less than @xmath1  k. in order to observe emission lines formed at higher temperatures , observations in the extreme ultraviolet or x - ray regions are normally required .",
    "simultaneous observations in these different wavelength regions are difficult to obtain .",
    "we have observed the dwarf star @xmath0  eri ( hd  22049 , k2  v ) with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _",
    "hst_. this instrument has unprecedented sensitivity and spectral resolution at wavelengths down to @xmath2    ( woodgate et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the in - orbit performance of the stis is described by kimble et al .",
    "in addition to the usual chromospheric and low transition region lines observed in this star with iue ( ayres et al .",
    "1983 ) , we have detected two forbidden ( magnetic dipole ) transitions in , which are formed at an electron temperature ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath4  k. these lines were first identified by burton , ridgeley & wilson ( 1967 ) in a solar spectrum obtained during a skylark rocket flight , but until now they have not been observed in another star .",
    "their detection allows the high temperature part of the stellar atmosphere ( @xmath5  k ) to be studied simultaneously with the regions below @xmath1  k. this is important since the x - ray emission from cool dwarfs may vary with time depending on the number of active regions present .",
    "the activity cycle period of @xmath0  eri is probably around 5 years ( gray & baliunas 1995 ) .",
    "in addition to the line fluxes , we have measured the width of the stronger line .",
    "it is not possible to measure the widths of permitted lines with current extreme ultraviolet and soft x - ray instruments .",
    "together with spectroscopic measurements of the electron density , line widths are important in constraining possible coronal heating mechanisms ( see e.g. jordan 1991 ) .",
    "we also discuss the wavelengths measured for the and lines .",
    "@xmath0  eri is a well observed star at optical wavelengths ( see drake & smith 1993 ) and has a measured spatially averaged magnetic field of 165  gauss ( redi et al .",
    "it has also been observed with the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( _ euve _ ) ( schmitt et al .",
    "1996 ; laming et al . 1996 ) and in our _ rosat _ programme ( philippides 1996 ) .",
    "it has a faster rotation rate than the sun ( 11.68 days ) ( donahue , saar & baliunas 1996 ) and has higher surface fluxes and a higher mean coronal temperature of @xmath6  k ( laming , drake & widing 1996 ; philippides 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath0  eri is therefore ideal for studying the structure and heating of stars more active than the sun .",
    "the stellar parameters used below are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we have searched the stis archive for spectra of the active g / k - type dwarfs studied by montesinos & jordan  ( 1993 ) .",
    "both lines are present in stis spectra of 70  oph  a ( hd 165341 ) and @xmath7  cet ( hd 20630 ) .",
    "the 1242.00-  line is present in @xmath8  boo  a ( hd 131156a ) and @xmath9  ori ( hd 39587 ) , but the 1349.38-   line is barely detectable .",
    "these stars have been modelled by jordan  et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) and/or philippides  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the observations of @xmath0  eri were made on 2000 march 9 .",
    "spectra covering the wavelength range from 1150    to 1700    and from 1650    to 3100    were obtained using the csi mama ( multi - anode microchannel array ) detector and the cste mama detector , respectively .",
    "the most recent data reduction software has been used , which accounts for light scattered between different orders .",
    "two sections of the spectrum are shown in figs .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "these are the result of summing two separate exposures , which are individually very similar .",
    "2 shows the same region as in fig .",
    "1a , in the stis spectrum of @xmath8  boo  a.      fig .",
    "1a shows the resonance lines of ( @xmath10 ) and also a weaker , broader line .",
    "1b shows the region around 1350   , which contains another weak , broad line .",
    "these two broader lines are identified as the @xmath11 magnetic dipole transitions in",
    ". the observed wavelengths ( which include the correction for the stellar radial velocity of 15.5  km  s@xmath12 ) are given in table 2 .",
    "these were obtained by using a single gaussian fit to the line profiles .",
    "the absolute wavelength accuracy of the stis instrument is determined by the detector pixel size which corresponds to 0.014    at 1238.82    and 0.015    at 1349.40   .",
    "detector noise may in practice prevent this accuracy being achieved .",
    "table 2 also gives the laboratory wavelengths of the lines taken from kelly ( 1987 ) .",
    "the wavelength interval between these lines should be measurable to @xmath13   .",
    "in both the individual spectra and the combined spectrum our measured interval is slightly larger .",
    "the wavelength of the @xmath14 transition has been determined from laboratory observations of extreme ultraviolet lines ( jupn , isler & trbert 1993 ) , but this has not proved possible for the @xmath15 transition . instead , the solar wavelength of this transition is given ( sandlin et al .",
    "other solar measurements , often based on the assumption that lines of neutral atoms are unshifted , give the same value .",
    "however , the value adopted differs from that given by kelly ( 1987 ) by @xmath16   .    from table 2",
    "it can be seen that the and lines are observed at their accepted rest wavelengths to within 0.018    ( or 4.3  km  s@xmath12 ) .",
    "also , there are no shifts in wavelength with respect to the optically thin lines of at 1355.598    and 1358.512   , to within the wavelength accuracy possible .",
    "the lines have some excess intensity in their wings above that derived from a single gaussian fit , which will be discussed in future work .",
    "many other forbidden lines of highly ionised species are observed in the solar uv spectrum ( jordan 1972 ; sandlin , brueckner & tousey 1977 ; feldman & doschek 1977 ) , but no others appear in the spectrum of @xmath0  eri . the only other highly ionized forbidden line observed in the ultraviolet spectra of stars other than the sun is a transition of at 1354.08   , which was first observed in a spectrum of the dm0e star au  mic ( maran et al .",
    "1994 ) obtained with the ghrs on the _",
    "the fluxes observed at the earth in the and lines and the line widths ( full - width at half - maximum ) are also given in table 2 .",
    "these were also obtained using a single gaussian fit to the line profiles , supplemented by measurements of the total line flux above the local continuum .    to check",
    "whether or not @xmath0  eri was unusually active at the time of observation , the fluxes in the lines have been compared with those observed with _ iue _",
    "( jordan et al . 1987 ) .",
    "the lines were too weak to observe at high resolution with _ iue_. their combined flux , plus the flux in the 1242.00-  line ,",
    "was measured from a low resolution spectrum and was only 16 percent smaller than the present value .",
    "this suggests that the level of activity at the time of the stis and _ iue _ observations was not significantly different .",
    "early calculations of the ratios of the fluxes in lines between levels of the ground configuration showed that these can be sensitive to the electron density ( @xmath17 ) ( gabriel & jordan 1975 ; flower 1977 ) .",
    "the chianti data base ( dere et al . 1997 v3.01 ) contains up - to - date atomic data and has been used to calculate the ratio of the fluxes in the observed lines of as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath3 . at @xmath18  k , the temperature at which the line emissivity has its maximum value , the flux ratio f(1242.00  )/f(1349.38   ) is approximately constant between electron pressures of @xmath19 to @xmath20  @xmath21  k and then increases rapidly with @xmath22 .",
    "the observed ratio gives an electron pressure of @xmath23  @xmath21  k , but the substantial uncertainty in the ratio gives only an upper limit of @xmath24  @xmath21  k. measurements of the flux ratios for several transition region line pairs which are sensitive to @xmath17 lead to a mean electron pressure of around @xmath20  @xmath21  k. ( this work will be reported in a later paper . ) only the density sensitive line at 1892.03    was observable in the _ iue _ high resolution spectrum of @xmath0  eri .",
    "when the density sensitive emission measure of the line was compared to the mean emission measure over the temperature range where this line is formed , an electron pressure in the range @xmath25  @xmath21  k was found ( jordan et al .",
    "1987 ) , consistent with the present improved mean value .",
    "density sensitive lines are also observed in the _ euve _ spectrum , although line blending is significant and the spectra have a low signal - to - noise . using line ratios in , laming et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found densities corresponding to electron pressures between @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xmath21  k , significantly lower than the values we derive . from the same spectrum , schmitt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found a density corresponding to @xmath28  @xmath21  k , but with @xmath29 errors , values in the range @xmath26 to @xmath30  @xmath21  k were possible .",
    "the observed flux in the 1242.00-  line has been converted to the stellar surface flux using the stellar distance and radius given in table 1 .",
    "this surface flux has then been used to calculate the emission measure locus ( @xmath31 as f(@xmath3)- see jordan et al .",
    "1987 for the method ) . using the atomic data from chianti and the relative ion number densities of arnaud & rothenflug ( 1985 ) ,",
    "the peak emissivity occurs at @xmath32  k ( for , other ion population calculations give similar results ) .",
    "the stellar photospheric abundance of iron ( @xmath33 ) ( drake & smith 1993 ) was adopted . with a pressure of @xmath20  @xmath21  k and assuming a plane parallel layer , the emission measure derived at @xmath32  k is @xmath34  @xmath35 .",
    "this emission measure can be compared with that derived from the flux observed in the extreme ultraviolet lines of around 195    by laming et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in spectra obtained with the _ euve_. however , unlike the ultraviolet region , the extreme ultraviolet region is subject to absorption by the hydrogen and helium continuua in the intervening interstellar medium . the interstellar absorption by hydrogen is usually found by comparing the observed h lyman @xmath36 profile with an estimated intrinsic stellar profile .",
    "dring et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find a column density of @xmath37  @xmath38 . a new model of the chromosphere and transition region of @xmath0  eri will be made to improve the intrinsic stellar profile .",
    "other estimates rely on general relations derived from large surveys of interstellar absorption based on the spectra of hot stars . for @xmath0  eri ,",
    "the latter method gives estimates of @xmath39 between @xmath40  @xmath38 ( laming et al .",
    "1996 ) and @xmath41  @xmath38 ( philippides 1996 ) , leading to transmission factors at 195    between 0.74 and 0.88 , respectively .",
    "the difference between the above transmissions is not large at 195    and we adopt the value of 0.88 .    for consistency we calculated the emission measure locus from the photon fluxes given by laming et al .",
    "( 1996 ) using the same method as that adopted for the uv lines , rather than using the value derived by these authors or by schmitt et al .",
    "the emission measure found from the line at 195.12    is then @xmath42  @xmath35 , a factor of about 3 smaller than that derived from the forbidden line .",
    "the value derived from the emissivities of brickhouse , raymond & smith ( 1995 ) is the same to within @xmath43  dex .",
    "this difference of a factor of 3 is larger than the uncertainty in the interstellar absorption .",
    "it is possible that , owing to the low signal - to - noise , the line flux has been underestimated , but an underestimate of a factor of 3 seems unlikely .",
    "although the electron pressure derived has an estimated uncertainty of around @xmath44  percent , over the density range of interest , the emission measures have little sensitivity to @xmath17 .",
    "a factor of 3 error in the relative excited level populations also seems unlikely . in their analysis of the lines observed in spectra obtained during the 1970 solar eclipse , gabriel & jordan ( 1975 ) derived @xmath45 populations by using the mean quiet sun temperature and density to normalize their calculations .",
    "the @xmath46 populations that they found agree with those from chianti to within 10 percent .",
    "variations in the level of activity between the times of the stis and _ euve _ observations can not be excluded as the source of the discrepancy .",
    "the emission measure derived from the lines is @xmath47  @xmath35 at @xmath48  k.",
    "to illustrate the potential use of both line intensities and widths we consider the non - thermal energy flux that could be carried in a wave mode , as given by @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the gas density , @xmath51 is the turbulent velocity and @xmath52 is the wave propagation velocity .",
    "the observed line width yields the most probable non - thermal velocity @xmath8 ( see e.g. jordan et al .",
    "1987 ) and then @xmath53 .",
    "assuming a wave flux that propagates at the alfvn velocity ( @xmath54 ) , the non - thermal energy flux can be found from the and lines .",
    "the values derived are @xmath55  erg  @xmath38  s@xmath12 from the lines and @xmath56  erg  @xmath38  s@xmath12   from the 1242.00-  line .",
    "if both sides of equation ( 1 ) are multiplied by @xmath57 , the area occupied by the magnetic field , then if there is no energy dissipation until the corona is reached , one would expect the same values of @xmath58 from the different lines , which is not the case .",
    "however , a varying inclination of the mean magnetic field will affect the values of @xmath8 derived and not all the magnetic flux present in the transition region may continue to the corona .",
    "the energy flux upwards at @xmath32  k , where the lines are formed , can be compared with the energy conducted down from the corona at this temperature .",
    "the conductive flux is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60  erg  cm@xmath12  s@xmath12  k@xmath62 .",
    "the temperature gradient can be written in terms of the local emission measure averaged over the typical temperature range of line formation ( @xmath63  dex ) using @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( see jordan et al .",
    "1997 for details ) .",
    "this gives @xmath66  erg  @xmath38  s@xmath12 at @xmath67  k. the coronal radiation loss should also be included , but for reasons of thermal stability should not exceed @xmath68 .",
    "thus equating @xmath69 to the upwards energy flux results in a magnetic flux density of 19  gauss , to within a factor of two .",
    "this is an upper limit since the emission measure is a spatially averaged value .",
    "since the observed spatially averaged surface magnetic field is 165  gauss , not all the surface flux is required to extend to @xmath32  k.    in future work the full range of line fluxes and widths observed will be used to make a new model of the outer atmosphere of @xmath0  eri and to investigate the energy balance and heating requirements in more detail .",
    "the above numerical estimates are meanwhile illustrative .",
    "the newly identified lines of offer the first opportunity for simultaneous studies of the upper transition region / corona and the lower transition region of moderately active dwarfs .",
    "line fluxes , widths and shifts are useful in investigating processes related to the coronal heating . although the spectra of @xmath0  eri have the best signal - to - noise ratio , useful data can be extracted from the spectra of several other dwarfs .",
