    "we recently completed an analysis of the prospects for discovering the standard higgs boson at the fermilab tevatron , a @xmath8 tev @xmath9 collider , assuming 1 @xmath10 of integrated luminosity ( which requires the main injector upgrade ) @xcite .",
    "our motivation for undertaking that study was a desire to exploit the tevatron to its full potential .",
    "we showed that the most promising mode is @xmath11 production , followed by @xmath12 and leptonic decay of the weak bosons @xcite .",
    "we concluded that it may be possible , though challenging , to detect a higgs boson in the mass region @xmath13 gev using these modes ( a region that will also be explored by cern lep ii ) .",
    "the high luminosity which will be provided by the main injector ( @xmath14 ) together with the ability to detect secondary vertices from @xmath15 quarks with a silicon vertex detector ( svx ) make the search for the higgs boson at the tevatron potentially viable over this limited mass range .",
    "lep ii can search for a higgs boson of mass up to @xmath16 gev @xcite . beyond that , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a 14 tev high - luminosity @xmath17 collider ( @xmath18 ) , is planned to cover the higgs - boson mass range from 80 gev up to 800 gev @xcite . however , the `` intermediate mass '' region , 80 gev @xmath19 120 gev , is particularly difficult for hadron supercolliders . at the lhc ,",
    "the search for the intermediate - mass higgs boson relies on the rare decay mode @xmath5 , which requires maintaining excellent photon energy and angular resolution while running at full luminosity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this signal becomes inaccessible if the branching ratio of the higgs boson to two photons is sufficiently suppressed below the standard - model value .",
    "this can occur , for example , if the coupling of the higgs boson to bottom quarks is enhanced with respect to the standard - model value , thereby increasing the total width of the higgs boson , which is dominated by @xmath20 in the intermediate - mass region .",
    "such a scenario can be realized for the light higgs scalar ( or the heavy higgs scalar ) of the minimal supersymmetric model .",
    "we therefore return to our study of the search for the higgs boson via @xmath2 , followed by @xmath20 , to ask whether this mode could be used at future hadron colliders to search for a higgs boson above the mass range that will be covered by lep ii .",
    "even if an intermediate - mass higgs boson can be detected at the lhc via @xmath5 , it would still be valuable to observe @xmath11 production , and the decay @xmath3 , to explore the coupling of the higgs boson to weak vector bosons and bottom quarks .",
    "along with the lhc , we consider two possible upgrades of the tevatron collider at fermilab .",
    "the first is to increase the luminosity of the machine to @xmath21 , and perhaps more .",
    "this could be achieved by adding several new rings of magnets , some or all in the main injector tunnel , to increase the intensity of the antiproton source @xcite .",
    "the second is to increase the energy of the machine along with the luminosity . of the various energy upgrades which one could consider",
    ", an `` energy doubler '' significantly increases the physics potential of the machine , can be built on a relatively short time scale , and may be complementary to the lhc in some ways @xcite . this machine would produce a large sample of top quarks and extend the search range for new physics , e.  g. , supersymmetry , @xmath22 bosons , etc .",
    "the installation of a new ring of high - field magnets to replace the existing 4.4 tesla magnets is required .",
    "the machine we consider is a 3.5 tev ( 7.7 tesla magnets ) @xmath9 collider",
    ". collider .",
    "the results for that machine are similar to those for the 3.5 tev machine , as will be quantified in a later footnote . ]",
    "the total cross sections for the various higgs - boson production processes at the tevatron 2 tev @xmath9 collider . ] and the lhc can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the various cross sections at the 3.5 tev @xmath9 collider .",
    "the qcd corrections to @xmath23 @xcite ( a factor of 2.1 in the @xmath24 scheme with @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 @xcite ( a factor of 1.2 in the @xmath24 scheme with @xmath27 ) are included .",
    "the @xmath23 cross section is increased by a factor of about @xmath28 over the corresponding tevatron cross section for @xmath29 gev .",
    "the @xmath2 cross section is increased by a factor of about 2 over the corresponding tevatron cross section ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in section 2",
    "we reconsider our previous analysis of @xmath11 and @xmath30 production , followed by @xmath3 and leptonic decay of the weak bosons , for the tevatron , the @xmath1 3.5 tev @xmath9 collider , and the lhc .",
    "we list the number of events obtained with 10 @xmath10 of integrated luminosity ; this corresponds to one `` year '' ( @xmath31 ) of running at an instantaneous luminosity of @xmath21 .",
    "we also consider larger integrated luminosities , with the caveat that @xmath15-tagging with high efficiency and purity , which is essential to the extraction of the signal , may prove to be difficult at higher instantaneous luminosities . with a bunch spacing of 20 @xmath32 , a luminosity of @xmath21 yields about 1.5 interactions per bunch crossing , which is acceptable for tagging secondary vertices with the svx .",
    "however , with the same bunch spacing , a luminosity of @xmath33 yields about 15 interactions per bunch crossing .",
    "it is not known how successful @xmath15-tagging with the svx will be in an environment with many interactions per bunch crossing .    in section 3",
    "we consider the search for the lightest higgs scalar , @xmath6 , of the minimal supersymmetric model , which contains two higgs doublets .",
    "there is a region of parameter space in which the light higgs scalar ( or the heavy higgs scalar ) has enhanced coupling to the @xmath15 quark , suppressing the branching ratio of @xmath34 such that it is unobservable at the lhc .",
    "we show that the mode @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , can potentially be used to observe this higgs boson over some of the region where @xmath34 is unobservable .",
    "this mode is therefore complementary to the two - photon search mode for the light supersymmetric higgs scalar at hadron colliders . in section 4",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "associated production of higgs and weak vector bosons , with @xmath37 , was considered in detail at the tevatron in our previous study @xcite .",
    "the analysis here closely follows that work , and we refer the reader to that paper for additional details .",
    "the weak bosons are detected via their leptonic decays ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the cuts made to simulate the acceptance of the detector are listed in table 1 .",
    "the jet energy resolution is taken to be @xmath39 , which corresponds to a two - jet invariant - mass resolution of about @xmath40 ( added in quadrature ) .",
    "decays , which occur in @xmath41 of the events . ]",
    "we integrate the background over an invariant - mass bin of @xmath42 ; for @xmath43 100 gev , this amounts to a bin width of 34 gev . a change from our previous analysis",
    "is that we reduce the @xmath44 threshold for observing charged leptons to @xmath45 gev ( although we continue to trigger on leptons of @xmath46 20 gev ) .",
    "this is important for rejecting the top - quark background to the @xmath11 signal .",
    "we also extend the coverage for jets out to a rapidity of 4 , for the same reason .",
    "we will comment on the effect of reducing the jet coverage to a rapidity of 2.5 at the fermilab machines .",
    "ll @xmath47 & @xmath48 gev + @xmath49 & @xmath50 gev ( 20 gev ) + @xmath51 & @xmath52 gev + @xmath53 & @xmath54 + @xmath55 gev & ( for @xmath56 ) +    the cross sections for the signals and backgrounds at the tevatron , the 3.5 tev @xmath9 collider , and the lhc , including all branching ratios and acceptances , are shown in figs .  2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 cross sections at the 3.5 tev collider and the lhc are increased by factors of about 2 and 4 , respectively , after acceptance cuts , over the corresponding cross sections at the tevatron .",
    "the dominant irreducible backgrounds are @xmath57 and , for @xmath58 near @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the dominant reducible background is @xmath62 ( not shown in the figures ) . and",
    "@xmath63 backgrounds were calculated using the code developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] in our previous study , we demanded that at least one jet be identified as a @xmath15 jet to reduce this background ; it nevertheless remained the dominant background , assuming a 1% misidentification of a jet as a @xmath15 jet .",
    "when one considers higher luminosity , one obtains enough @xmath2 signal events that it becomes advantageous to demand that _ both _ jets be identified as @xmath15 jets .",
    "this greatly reduces the @xmath62 background . at the fermilab colliders ,",
    "this background is significantly less than the irreducible @xmath57 background , while at the lhc the @xmath64 background is comparable to the @xmath65 background , and @xmath63 is negligible compared with @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath62 background is relatively larger at the lhc because it is initiated mostly by gluon - quark collisions , while the signal arises from quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "similarly , the @xmath66 background at the lhc is initiated by gluon - gluon collisions , which accounts for its relatively large size . assuming an efficiency @xmath67 0.3 for tagging a @xmath15 jet within the fiducial volume of the svx and with @xmath68 15 gev",
    ", we use @xmath69 0.09 as an estimate of the efficiency for a double @xmath15 tag .    another reducible background to the @xmath65 signal",
    "is from @xmath70 production , followed by @xmath71 with one @xmath72 missed .",
    "reduction of this background requires coverage of leptons to small @xmath73 and jets to high rapidity , to reduce the likelihood of missing a @xmath72 boson .",
    "we reject events with a hadronic decay of the additional @xmath72 boson if a jet from the @xmath72 decay with @xmath68 30 gev , or two jets with @xmath74 15 gev ( and invariant mass near @xmath75 ) , are observed .",
    "we calculate that the signal is accompanied by jets exceeding these cuts only about @xmath76 of the time at the fermilab machines , and @xmath77 of the time at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we also impose the requirement that the transverse mass of the trigger charged lepton plus the missing @xmath44 be less than @xmath75 , which is almost always true for the signal .",

    "it may also be possible to observe the heavy higgs scalar , @xmath102 , of the minimal supersymmetric model via @xmath11 , with @xmath3 , if @xmath102 is relatively light .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath124 , the heavy higgs scalar approaches its lower bound , which is the same as the upper bound on the mass of the light higgs scalar , eq .",
    "[ bound ] , as @xmath132 . for large @xmath124 , there is a region of parameter space in which @xmath102 is near its lower bound , @xmath6 is heavier than 50 gev , the coupling of @xmath102 to weak vector bosons is almost of standard - model strength , and its coupling to bottom quarks is at least of standard - model strength .",
    "this region lies roughly between @xmath133 50 and 100 gev for large @xmath124 , depending on the top - quark mass and the top - squark masses .",
    "the intermediate - mass higgs boson , 80 gev @xmath134 120 gev , is elusive .",
    "it is too heavy to be produced at lep ii , and can be discovered at the lhc using the rare two - photon decay mode only if excellent photon energy and angular resolution can be maintained while running at full luminosity ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "we have shown that higgs - boson production in association with a weak vector boson , followed by @xmath3 and leptonic decay of the weak vector boson , can potentially be used to observe the standard higgs boson in the intermediate - mass range at future hadron colliders .",
    "the machines we considered are the fermilab tevatron ( @xmath0 2 tev ) with high luminosity ( @xmath136 ) , an upgraded tevatron of energy @xmath0 3.5 tev with high luminosity , and the lhc ( @xmath0 14 tev ) . with 30 @xmath10 of integrated luminosity ,",
    "a 5@xmath92 signal is possible in the @xmath11 channel for a higgs boson of mass up to about 95 gev at the tevatron , about 100 gev at the 3.5 tev @xmath9 collider , and also about 100 gev at the lhc . with 100 @xmath10 of integrated luminosity ,",
    "the reach of the tevatron , the 3.5 tev @xmath9 collider , and the lhc is about 120 , 125 , and 120 gev , respectively .",
    "however , to gather this amount of integrated luminosity would require @xmath15-tagging in an environment with many interactions per bunch crossing , which may prove to be difficult .",
    "we conclude that each of these machines can potentially cover the intermediate - mass region .",
    "if the coupling of the higgs boson to bottom quarks is enhanced , the decay of the intermediate - mass higgs boson to two photons can be suppressed such that it is unobservable at the lhc .",
    "this can occur for the light higgs scalar , @xmath6 , of the minimal supersymmetric model , whose mass lies within or below the intermediate - mass region if the top quark and the top squarks are not too heavy .",
    "the enhanced coupling of @xmath6 to bottom quarks increases the mass at which the branching ratio of @xmath36 begins to fall off due to the competition from @xmath137 .",
    "we showed that the mode @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , can potentially cover part of the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric model not accessible to lep ii or the lhc ( using @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is also possible that the heavy higgs scalar of the minimal supersymmetric model , @xmath102 , can be observed via @xmath11 production over part of the parameter space .",
    "we hope that this paper will revitalize interest in associated production of higgs and weak vector bosons , with @xmath3 , at future hadron colliders .",
    "we encourage the detector collaborations at the tevatron and the lhc to undertake a deeper study of the potential usefulness of this mode .",
