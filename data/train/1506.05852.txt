    "<S> this is used to modulate another , weaker beam of light ( green ) at a different wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    some exceptional opportunities for developing engineered nonlinear media are provided by nano - optomechanics that take advantage of the changing balance of forces at the nanoscale @xcite . with the decrease in the physical dimensions of a system the electromagnetic forces between constituent elements grow , as may be illustrated by the repulsion of electrons as their separation diminishes . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , elastic forces , such as the force restoring a compressed spring , decrease with size . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the nanoscale metamaterial building blocks have high natural frequencies and thus can be moved very fast , potentially offering ghz switching bandwidth for elements of sub - micron size .    </S>",
    "<S> recently this was exploited to develop reconfigurable metamaterials fabricated on nanoscale elastic membranes . </S>",
    "<S> these photonic metamaterials can be driven thermo - elastically @xcite and with electromagnetic forces , such as the coulomb force between charged elements of the nanostructure @xcite , or the lorentz force acting on currents running through conductive elements in magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their electro - optical and magneto - optical switching characteristics surpass those of natural media by orders of magnitude .    </S>",

    "<S> it has been suggested that nearfield @xcite and casimir forces @xcite in metamaterials are modified in the presence of light . </S>",
    "<S> forces between oscillating plasmonic or displacement currents induced by light in metamolecules were also theoretically shown to be sufficient to drive reconfiguration of a metamaterial structure in the optical part of the spectrum @xcite , and proof - of - principle experiments on such interactions between individual metamolecules have been reported at microwave frequencies @xcite .    here we show that reversible reconfiguration of a plasmonic metamaterial nanostructure driven by optical forces between its illuminated elements can be the source of a strong optical nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this cubic nonlinearity may be used to modulate light with light at milliwatt power levels . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , although for the majority of media the magnitude of nonlinearity tends to be proportional to its response time , the nano - opto - mechnical nonlinearity is three orders of magnitude faster than could be expected from this otherwise universal trend .    </S>",
    "<S> the plasmonic nanomechanical metamaterial was fabricated on strips of suspended dielectric membrane of nanoscale thickness in such a way that plasmonic elements of the metamolecules were located on different strips . here </S>",
    "<S> light illumination leads to electromagnetic and thermal forces that induce nanoscale strip displacements and thus reconfiguration of individual metamolecules in a way that affects their plasmonic resonances , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the nanostructure was fabricated by focused ion beam milling from a 50  nm thick silicon nitride membrane covered by 50  nm of gold . </S>",

    "<S> optical forces in such metamaterial nanostructures can be understood as time - averaged coulomb and lorentz forces acting between the currents and oscillating dipole charges of the plasmonic resonators in the presence of the illuminating electromagnetic wave @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , repulsive and attractive optical forces within the metamaterial plane for illumination at wavelengths of 1310  nm and 1550  nm correspond to repulsive and attractive interaction of the dipole charges on neighboring strips , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> probe optical sources we used fiber - coupled telecommunication laser diodes operating at the wavelengths of 1550  nm and 1310  nm , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> were then combined into a single beam using a fiber coupler , de - coupled into free space and focused on the sample placed in a microscope using focusing and collection objectives . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was placed in a cell evacuated to the pressure of 30  pa to prevent damping of the nano - mechanical motion . </S>",
    "<S> light transmitted through the sample was detected by an ingaas photodetector and a lock - in amplifier locked to the pump modulation frequency . in order to optimize the light - induced nano - opto - mechanical modulation , we pumped the nanostructure at 1550  nm just above its absorption resonance , where simulations predict significant in - plane forces .    at low modulation frequencies , below 100  khz </S>",
    "<S> , the optical pump leads to pronounced modulation of the metamaterial s transmission at the probe wavelength , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - modulation]c . for 0.9  mw </S>",
    "<S> pump power ( peak intensity 920  w/@xmath16 ) a modulation amplitude on the order of 1@xmath17 is observed at 25  khz modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the low - frequency component of the nonlinear response has a thermal nature and drops rapidly with increasing modulation frequency , fading at a few 100s of khz . in this frequency range , the modulation amplitude halves as </S>",
    "<S> the modulation frequency doubles which is consistent with a thermal deformation of the bimorph au / sinx membrane , see inset to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - modulation]b . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with thermal calculations for 50  nm gold @xcite and silicon nitride @xcite layers , which predict conductive cooling timescales on the order of 20 - 30  @xmath2s . </S>",
    "<S> the light - induced heating of the nanostructure is balanced by heat conduction along the metamaterial strips and according to our calculations can reach hundreds of degrees with pump excitation at 1  kw/@xmath16 . as the thermal expansion coefficient of gold ( 14.4 @xmath18/k ) </S>",
    "<S> exceeds that of silicon nitride ( 2.8 @xmath18/k ) 5-fold such large temperature changes will bend the strips . when heated by the modulated pump laser narrow strips will rise higher than wider strips due to more complete gold coverage ; the metamolecule changes its shape and therefore its plamonic absorption and transmission for the probe wavelength change .    </S>",
    "<S> while the thermal nonlinearity easily dominates at low modulation frequencies , other modulation mechanisms are at play at higher frequencies . indeed , as differential thermal expansion in the layered structure can only drive motion out of the metamaterial plane , it can not drive in - plane resonant oscillations of the metamaterial strips . </S>",
    "<S> several resonant peaks of nonlinear response are seen at much higher frequencies around 600  khz , 1  mhz and 2  mhz , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - modulation]c . </S>",
    "<S> mechanical eigenmode calculations identify the resonances as the fundamental modes of oscillation of the narrow and wide strips , corresponding to vibration normal to the metamaterial plane ( around 600 khz ) and motion within the metamaterial plane ( at mhz frequencies ) , see insets . comparing the sub-@xmath2s heating and cooling cycles to the characteristic strip cooling timescale , we argue for their non - thermal origin .    to assess the origin of the high frequency modulation we estimate the optomechanical deformation that can be expected from the optical forces acting between different parts of the metamolacular resonator . </S>",
    "<S> based on the results of simulations presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - simulations]c , pump - induced optical forces reach @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for the narrow ( wide ) strips . for a strip pair with 29 unit cells and 920  w/@xmath16 pump intensity , </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to about 220  fn ( 90  fn ) force per strip . estimating the spring constant @xmath21 from strip mass @xmath22 and measured resonance frequency @xmath23 as @xmath2428 fn / pm ( 56 fn / pm ) for out - of - plane deformation </S>",
    "<S> , we may expect the gap between strips and thus between elements of the metamolecule to change by 6  pm . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding estimates for in - plane deformation predict a gap change on the order of 1  pm . </S>",
    "<S> such modulation is not sufficient to create a detectable level of non - resonant high - frequency modulation . </S>",
    "<S> however , much larger displacements are expected at the structure s mechanical resonances , where the displacement will be enhanced by the quality factor of the mechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> our optical measurements show mechanical resonance quality factors on the order of 100 , which may serve as a lower limit for the quality factor of mechanical resonances of individual strips as the overall resonance profile is affected by inhomogeneous broadening due to slight structural variations from strip to strip . taking this enhancement into account , </S>",
    "<S> optical forces are definitely sufficient to induce resonant strip displacements on the order of 1  nm , which is consistent with the observed transmission modulation on the order of 1% . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we argue that the resonant response at 600 khz , 1 mhz and 2 mhz is predominantly driven by non - thermal , optical forces .     * optical nonlinearities in metamaterials and conventional media . * cubic optical nonlinearities due to thermal effects , saturated absorption , molecular orientation and electronic anharmonicity follow a general trend of decreasing achievable modulation frequency @xmath25 with increasing magnitude of the nonlinearity : @xmath26 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> metamaterial patterning of plasmonic metal ( points 1 and 2 , @xcite ) , hybridization of carbon nanotubes ( point 3 , @xcite ) , graphene ( point 4 , @xcite ) , and semiconductors ( points 5 and 6 , @xcite ) with metamaterials resonantly enhances the magnitude of the nonlinear response without affecting its response time . </S>",
    "<S> nano - opto - mechanical metamaterial demonstrated in the present work also departs from the common trend exhibiting @xmath27 that is three orders of magnitude bigger than in conventional nonlinear media ( point 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    absorption in a nonlinear medium is conventionally described by the expression @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is light intensity , @xmath12 is the propagation distance and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the linear and nonlinear absorption coefficients . as the observed nonlinear transmission change is proportional to the pump power , we can quantify the nonlinearity of the reconfigurable photonic metamaterial by estimating its first nonlinear absorption coefficient @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the nonlinear transmission change @xmath32 results from nonlinear absorption , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the metamaterial s thickness . </S>",
    "<S> at 1  mhz modulation frequency , @xmath35  m / w corresponding to a nonlinear susceptibility on the order of @xmath36 and a nonlinear imaginary refractive index change @xmath37 at 920  w/@xmath16 pump intensity . </S>",
    "<S> we argue here that the observed nano - opto - mechanical nonlinearity is special as it exhibits a departure from the prevailing relation between speed and magnitude of nonlinear responses ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - nonlinearity ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this happens in a way that allows larger nonlinearity or higher modulation frequency to be achieved than could be expected from traditional media . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it appears that for many mechanisms of optical nonlinearity the achievable modulation frequency @xmath25 is related to the magnitude of the nonlinerity @xmath38 in such a way that @xmath26 @xcite . at the resonance of in - plane motion , </S>",
    "<S> mhz rate modulation can be achieved at about 1  kw/@xmath16 of light intensity corresponding to about @xmath39 .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we provide the first experimental demonstration of a giant nano - opto - mechanical nonlinearity in plasmonic metamaterial that allows modulation of light with light at mhz frequencies and miliwatt power levels . </S>",
    "<S> bimorph deformation resulting from optical heating at low modulation frequencies and electromagnetic forces between elements of plasmonic resonators drive the nonlinear response . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude and spectral position of the underlying optical resonance can be controlled across the optical spectral range by design of the plasmonic resonators and the supporting nano - membrane strips . </S>"
