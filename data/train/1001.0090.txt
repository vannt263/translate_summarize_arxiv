    "the meissner effect in a mesoscopic cylindrical structure consisting of a superconductor coated with a pure normal - metal layer has interesting features due to the coherent quantum effects in the normal metal .",
    "they are observable when there is a good contact between s and n constituents .",
    "this problem within the quasiclassical eilenberger formalism was first investigated theoretically by zaikin @xcite .",
    "recent advanced technologies of preparation of pure samples have enabled to investigate the coherence properties of mesoscopic samples taking a proper account of the proximity effect @xcite .",
    "the samples were superconducting nb wires with a radius @xmath0 of tens of microns coated with a thin layer @xmath1 of high - purity cu , ag or au . mota and",
    "co - workers @xcite detected surprising behavior of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath2 of a cylindrical ns structure ( n and s are for the normal metal and the superconductor , respectively ) at very low temperatures ( @xmath3 @xmath4 mk ) in an external magnetic field parallel to the ns boundary .",
    "most intriguingly , a decrease in the sample temperature below a certain point @xmath5 ( at a fixed field ) produced a paramagnetic reentrant effect : the decrease of magnetic susceptibility of the structure is changed to an unexpected grow .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in the isothermal reentrant effect in a field decreasing to a certain value @xmath6 below which the susceptibility started to grow sharply .",
    "it is emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite that the detected magnetic response of the ns structure is similar to the properties of the persistent currents in mesoscopic normal rings .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to explain the paramagnetic reentrant effect theoretically @xcite . however , the predicted amplitudes of the effect were too small ( except for @xcite ) to account for the experimental facts .",
    "fauchere , belzig and blatter @xcite explain the large paramagnetic effect assuming strong repulsive electron - electron interaction in noble metals .",
    "the proximity effect in the n metal induces an order parameter will be shifted by @xmath7 from the order parameter @xmath8 of the bulk superconductor .",
    "this generates the paramagnetic instability of the andreev states , and the density of states of the ns structure exhibits a * _ single _ * peak near zero energy .",
    "the theory developed in ref .",
    "@xcite essentially relies on the assumption of the repulsive electron interaction in the normal region .",
    "maki and haas @xcite made the assumption that * *  * * in noble metals ( ag , au ) p - wave superconductors may occur with a transition temperature of order @xmath9 mk .",
    "below @xmath10 p -wave triplet superconductivity emerges around the periphery of the cylinder .",
    "the diamagnetic current flowing in the periphery is compensated by a quantized paramagnetic current in the opposite direction thus providing a simple explanation for the reentrant effect .",
    "as in @xcite , the authors of @xcite also allow for paramagnetic current in the system , which flows in the opposite direction to the diamagnetic current .",
    "its amplitude is sufficient to explain the reentrant effect , but this theory says nothing about the temperature and field dependences of magnetic susceptibility at ultra - low temperatures and in low magnetic fields .",
    "a theoretical basis for understanding the paramagnetic reentrant effect has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the theory is essentially based on the properties of the quantized levels of the ns structure .",
    "the meissner effect is rather special in a superconducting cylinder coated with a pure normal - metal layer .",
    "the applied magnetic field generates superconducting current in the surface layer whose thickness is equal to the field penetration depth @xmath11 .",
    "simultaneously , the aharonov - bohm effect generates persistent current ( through the mechanism of the andreev scattering of quasiparticles ) in the normal layer near the ns boundary .",
    "if n and s metals are separated by a dielectric layer destroying the andreev scattering , the additional current disappears , and the meissner effect returns to its usual form .",
    "the levels with energies no more than @xmath8 ( 2@xmath8 is the gap of the superconductor ) appear inside the normal metal bounded by the dielectric ( vacuum ) on one side and the superconductor on the other side . because of the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , the spectrum of the ns structure in a weak field is a function of the magnetic flux .",
    "the specific feature of the andreev quantum levels of the structure is that by varying field @xmath12 ( or temperature @xmath13 ) each level in the well periodically comes into coincidence with the chemical potential of the metal . as a result ,",
    "the state of the system suffer strong degeneracy , and the density of states on the energy of the ns sample experiences resonance spikes @xcite .",
    "this contributes significantly to the magnetic moment and causes a reentrant effect .",
    "note that in @xcite the calculation was performed for orbital susceptibility . in @xcite",
    "the explanation involves the spin ( pauli ) susceptibility of the system .    in this study we calculated the free energy of the ns structure and its magnetic moment ( current of magnetization ) in the magnetic field .",
    "an approximate analytical calculation was supplemented with a numerical one based on the exact spectrum of andreev levels @xcite in the ns contact .",
    "our approach is not based on application of the eilenberger equation .",
    "we calculate the thermodynamic potential to obtain the magnetic moment .",
    "consider a superconducting cylinder with the radius @xmath0 which is concentrically embedded with a thin layer @xmath1 of a pure normal metal . the structure is placed in a magnetic field @xmath14 oriented along the symmetry axis of the structure . it is assumed that the field is weak to the extent that the effect of twisting of quasiparticle trajectories becomes negligible .",
    "it actually reduces to the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , i.e. , allows for the increment in the phase of the wave function of the quasiparticle moving along its trajectory in the vector potential field .",

    "the spectrum characterizes the magnetic flux through the area of the triangle between the quasiparticle trajectory and the part of the ns boundary .",

    "these states are responsible for the reentrant effect",

    "the states induced by these trajectories are practically similar to the `` whispering gallery '' type of states appearing in the cross section of a solid normal cylinder in a weak magnetic field @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the size of the caustic of these trajectories is of the order of the cylinder radius , i.e. , they correspond in high magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "the spectrum thus formed carries no information about the parameters of the superconductor , and it is impossible to meet the resonance condition in this case .",
    "these states make a paramagnetic contribution in the thermodynamics of the ns structure but their amplitude is small ( @xmath45 ) .",
