    "the experimental results of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) indicate that the matter produced in the central collisions of au + au at @xmath0130 and 200 gev is a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) , and behaves like a perfect liquid @xcite .",
    "recently , the studies of the dissipative fluid dynamics become very hot in high energy heavy ion collisions , because people want to know why the sqgp exhibits an almost perfect fluid property and how to probe the viscosity effects on experimental observables .",
    "the relativistic formulism of dissipative fluids was originally derived by eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "their theories contain only the first - order terms of the dissipative quantities and therefore are referred to as the first - order theories of dissipative fluids .",
    "the theories of dissipative fluids which include the terms up to the second - order of the dissipative quantities were developed by mller ( non - relativistic ) @xcite and israel and stewart ( relativistic ) @xcite .",
    "these second - order theories can avoid the problem that the first - order theories may not be satisfied causality sometimes .",
    "so they are also called the causal theories of dissipative fluids dynamics .",
    "although the israel - stewart second - order formalism for relativistic dissipative fluids @xcite was established thirty years ago ( in the 1970s ) , its numerical implementation in high energy heavy ion collisions begins in the 21st century . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the viscous hydrodynamics based on the second - order theory is first used to study the system expansion in relativistic heavy ion collisions with the bjorken scaling hypothesis @xcite .",
    "recently , the causal dissipative fluid dynamics has been used in high heavy ion collisions for the investigations of the effects of shear viscosity and both shear and bulk viscosities @xcite on the transverse momentum distribution , elliptic flow , and hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry @xcite .",
    "as is well known , a dissipative fluid has not only shear viscosity but also bulk viscosity .",
    "recent researches @xcite indicate that the effects of the shear and bulk viscosities on the elliptic flow are completely different in the rhic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the shear viscosity suppresses the @xmath1 at larger transverse momentum but the bulk viscosity increases it @xcite . unlike elliptic flow , which reflects the anisotropic pressure of the system ,",
    "hbt correlations are related to the space - time structure of the particle - emitting source .",
    "the investigations of the shear and bulk viscosity effects on hbt interferometry may probably provide the messages of the shear and bulk viscosities from another aspect .    in the present work ,",
    "we begin with the equations based on the israel - stewart theory for the net baryon free system formed in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . for the central collisions",
    ", it is assumed that the system has the bjorken cylinder geometry ( expanding isotropically in transverse and satisfying longitudinal boost - invariance ) @xcite and undergoes the crossover transition from the qgp to hadronic gas .",
    "we shall take into account both the shear and bulk viscosities and solve the viscous hydrodynamic equations by the relativistic harten - lax - leer - einfeldt ( rhlle ) algorithm @xcite . by applying a simulated analysis of two - pion hbt interferometry @xcite to the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic sources",
    ", we investigate the effects of the shear and bulk viscosities on the hbt radii @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the hbt analyses indicate that the viscosity effect on the hbt results is small if one considers only the shear viscosity .",
    "the bulk viscosity leads to a larger transverse freeze - out configuration of the pion sources , and thus increases the transverse hbt radii .",
    "the results of the longitudinal hbt radius for the source with bjorken longitudinal scaling are consistent with the experimental data .",

    "the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density satisfies @xmath81 @xcite , and the bulk viscosity @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath183 @xcite .",

    "the bulk viscosity leads to a larger transverse freeze - out configuration of the pion sources , and therefore increases the transverse hbt radii .",

    "further investigations of the effects of shear and bulk viscosities on the hbt interferometry for more realistic viscous pion - emitting sources in relativistic heavy ion collisions are of great interest in the future .    in our model the bjorken longitudinal scaling hypothesis @xcite is adopted , which is an approximation for the heavy ion collisions at very high energies .",
    "our results indicate that the longitudinal hbt radius for the bjorken cylinder hydrodynamic source agrees well with the rhic hbt results .",
    "however the transverse hbt radii as functions of the pair transverse momentum for our bjorken cylinder sources are more flat than those of the experimental data .",
    "in order to explain the rhic hbt results , various models without viscosity were proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , the hydrodynamic source model including the initial collective flow , stiffer eos , and viscosity was proposed @xcite to explain the rhic hbt results .",
