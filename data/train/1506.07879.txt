    "the pursuit of topological quantum information processing with mesoscopic arrays@xcite of majorana chains@xcite is grounded on well investigated solid state technologies and showcases a new bridge between condensed matter physics and engineering . with current experimental techniques ,",
    "naturally available topological quantum matter is ill suited for quantum information processing.@xcite hence , one should try to design synthetic topological quantum matter with enhanced desirable characteristics .",
    "mesoscopic physics naturally sets the stage for this proposal because the microscopic understanding of interacting topological quantum matter is incomplete .",
    "hence one would like to exploit naturally occurring topological states , not as they come but as building blocks in mesoscopic arrays .    the majorana chain itself for example",
    "is not naturally available , and so the proposals for its realization@xcite are good examples of the quest for synthetic topological quantum matter .",
    "the parafermion chain@xcite is an even more ambitious proposal along these lines,@xcite motivated by a problem that parafermions can not , at least directly,@xcite wholly resolve in the end : the limited computational power of majoranas . with parafermions",
    "the idea@xcite is to modify mesoscopically the edge of a fractional quantum spin hall insulator by placing alternating _",
    "s_-wave superconducting and ferromagnetic islands in order to obtain , at low energies , an effective 1d lattice system of hybridized parafermion zero - energy modes . this basic mesoscopic blueprint has excited theoretical interest in various types of parafermion chains , with varying degrees of exoticism in their quantum phase diagrams@xcite and also varying potential for mesoscopic realization.@xcite    parafermions , and in particular majoranas , are examples of topological zero - modes .",
    "such modes are good for quantum information processing for three basic reasons : they are local , isolated in energy , and stable . as a consequence ,",
    "the manifold of ground states of the system that hosts these modes inherits desirable properties .",
    "first , its degeneracy is stable .",
    "second , it is possible to perform rotations in the ground manifold by coupling local probes to the topological modes . and",
    "third , there is an energy gap to non - topological excitations that sets the time scale for these manipulations .    in spite of their crucial practical value",
    ", the stability of topological zero - energy modes poses a problem for incremental design .",
    "take for example the basic blueprint for parafermions of the previous paragraph .",
    "the quantum statistics of the emergent lattice parafermion field is characterized by an integer @xmath2 , and on the mesoscopic setups of refs .",
    "for example , @xmath3 can only take the values @xmath4 , with @xmath5 an odd , positive integer . as a consequence , topological qutrits ( corresponding to @xmath6 )",
    "are not included in this otherwise very attractive proposal .",
    "this is a problem for the circuit model assisted by topological information processing , since quantum algorithms with qutrits are the best studied ones after qubits .",
    "now , since the ground degeneracy of the @xmath7 parafermion chain is six , it is natural to seek for a design that modifies the basic platform minimally , just enough to halve the degeneracy .",
    "but the degeneracy is protected by the stability of the topological zero - energy modes !",
    "it should be clear from this example how , in general , incremental design principles can be at odds with `` topological '' ones .    in this paper",
    ", we will propose a method based on symmetry manipulation without symmetry breaking to modify in a controlled fashion the structure of the set of zero - energy modes at the edge of topological quantum matter .",
    "our method in a nutshell starts by identifying discrete gauge fields naturally present in mesoscopic setups and naturally coupled to protecting symmetries . after providing dynamics to the gauge field",
    ", some or all of the topological degeneracy disappears . however , if the gauge fluctuations are properly manipulated , it is possible to remove only some of the topological degeneracy . as a consequence , the topological structure of the edge changes in a controlled and predictable way : some zero - modes disappear and the remaining ones control the new ground manifold of the system .",
    "given the symmetry analysis underlying our idea , one may ask why not just break explicitly the symmetry in question . an explicit symmetry breaking term would in general obtain the same result as that obtained by the gauge field without breaking the symmetry , and , in one space dimension , these two scenarios are often connected by a duality transformation .",
    "the answer is rooted deeply in the structure of anyon fields . as we will show , due to anyon statistics , the symmetries that must be manipulated in our framework can not be explicitly broken without violating locality .",
    "effectively , this observation provides a symmetry - based explanation of the stability , or  protection , \" of the zero - energy modes . by coupling the symmetry to a gauge field rather than breaking it ,",
    "we manage to modify topological zero modes without breaking locality .",
    "this idea evolved from our investigation of the effect of phase slips on the majorana chain,@xcite since they obtain a @xmath8 gauge field minimally coupled to the majorana degrees of freedom .",

    "we show evidence that our construction works as predicted by investigating the period of the supercurrent in a gauged parafermion ring junction as a function of the strength of the gauge fluctuations . restricting the gauge field dynamics to a @xmath9 subgroup",

    "the critical exponents of the transition between the topologically non - trivial and trivial phase correspond to the universality class of the three - state potts model for any finite strength of restricted gauge fluctuations , that is , on a critical line .",

    ". then the operator of fermionic parity @xmath20 measures the total number of fermions modulo two .    the majorana chain of kitaev @xcite is specified by the hamiltonian @xmath21 describing the competition between a topologically non - trivial phase for @xmath22 and a trivial phase for the complementary regime .",

    "the majorana chain displays twofold quasi - degeneracy protected by fermionic parity @xmath24 .",
    "this symmetry can not be broken explicitly due to a superselection rule enforcing vanishing matrix elements between sectors distinguished by fermionic parity .",
    "such a superselection rule can be traced back to the requirement of locality of the physical hamiltonian .",
    "it has been shown in ref .   that the quasi - degeneracy of the topologically non - trivial phase can not be lifted by local perturbations .",
    "this result suggests that there is no way of modifying the topological structure of the edge by local perturbations .",
    "but this inference is in fact incorrect for a physical realization , as opposed to the ideal representation , of the majorana chain.@xcite the reason is that the majorana chain will typically be realized in terms of electrically charged fermions , e.g. , electrons , which carry the electromagnetic @xmath25 gauge structure .",
    "induced superconductivity breaks most of that symmetry , but a @xmath9 part survives.@xcite this residual gauge symmetry , corresponding to an invariance of energy levels under a local multiplication of the majorana operators @xmath13 , @xmath14 by a factor of @xmath26 , is no longer manifest in the majorana chain due to a tacit but specific gauge choice . restoring the gauge fields normally used to absorb the effects of these residual gauge transformations",

    "the gauge field is quantum dynamic.@xcite    the gauged majorana chain must be supplemented with gauge constraints identifying physical states . since the @xmath25 symmetry originates from electromagnetism , all physical states should obey the @xmath9 descendant of gauss law .",
    "the chain has local symmetries @xmath32 and enforcing the gauss law corresponds to demanding that the local symmetries @xmath33 for @xmath34 of the gauged majorana chain act as the identity on physical states , @xmath35.@xcite    the perturbation proportional to @xmath36 in eq",
    ".   plays a subtle but definite role in tying the fate of the topologically non - trivial phase to the gauge field .",

    "is strongly suppressed , @xmath43 . in this case",
    ", the gauge fields may be removed from the theory by a specific gauge choice in order to recover the topologically non - trivial majorana chain  .",
    "however , we have showed in a previous publication@xcite that a finite value for @xmath44 may be obtained through quantum phase slips in a mesoscopic implementation of the kitaev model . at finite @xmath44 ,",
    "the properties of the kitaev model are fundamentally altered , because @xmath44 measures the strength of a relevant perturbation of fermionic parity .",
    "any non - zero value of @xmath44 will remove the topological degeneracy of the majorana chain for large enough system size .",
    "but why is this the case ?    one explanation comes from solving the gauge constraints for @xmath28 , giving @xmath45 in this way the dynamics of the gauge field @xmath29 drives nonlocal parity measurement of the part of the chain to the left and to the right of site @xmath46 , which is , in general , incompatible with the topological degeneracy . while the gauge fields are local degrees of freedom , they have highly nonlocal effects on the electronic degrees of freedom , which makes them prime candidates for the manipulation of topological phases without breaking protecting symmetries .",
    "moreover , the effects we are describing are not tied to the mean field approximation .",
    "very recently there has been some progress in the investigation of particle number conserving majorana chains,@xcite and , as should be clear from our arguments , we would not expect our conclusions to be any different for the @xmath8 gauged versions of such models .    to summarize , discrete gauge theories can emerge in a natural , controllable way in physical realizations of topological zero - energy boundary modes .",
    "moreover , for the majorana chain , one can destroy the topologically non - trivial phase phase by gauging the global symmetry of fermionic parity and making the corresponding @xmath9 gauge field dynamic . for parafermions ,",
    "a richer structure is possible .",
    "this is the subject of the rest of the paper .",
    "in this section we will briefly recall the basics of parafermions in one dimension , introduce the parafermion chain as a natural generalization of the majorana chain , and explain how the ground degeneracy of the parafermion chain is protected by the interplay between locality and anyonic statistics .",

    "more precisely , @xmath53 it is in general true of everything that follows that setting @xmath54 will recover some standard facts about fermions .    following the reasoning for the construction of the majorana chain by pairing the second parafermion on each site with strength @xmath55 with the first one the next site , one obtains the parafermion chain@xcite @xmath56 for @xmath37 , the parafermion chain displays exact zero - energy parafermion edge modes , @xmath57=0=[h_{\\sf p},\\delta_l],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] perfectly localized on the end points of the chain .",
    "as a consequence , the ground energy level is @xmath3-fold degenerate , and , in fact , every energy level is at least @xmath3-fold degenerate .",

    "practical applications of this observation were explored in ref .  .",

    "finally , let us emphasize that our numerical findings indicate that the two critical lines share a common endpoint marking the end of the critical phase of the @xmath0 parafermion chain .",

    "for a recent , comprehensive discussion .",

    "but a @xmath8 chain does not support a critical phase .",
    "hence it must be that the critical lines meet at the end of the critical phase .",
    "incidentally , this determines completely the boundary of the critical phase , since the starting point is a function of the final point by self - duality .",
    "topological zero - energy boundary modes are typically stable against generic perturbations , and it is precisely this feature that makes them attractive for quantum information processing .",
    "however , it is also this feature that makes them hard to mold in a controlled fashion . extending our previous work on the effect of phase slips in the majorana chain of kitaev",
    ", we have argued in this paper that for topological boundary modes associated to a global protecting symmetry , it is possible to modify the topological edge structure in a controlled fashion by engineering a gauge field into the system .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the gauge field act as a relevant perturbation without symmetry breaking , and permit to split the ground degeneracy of the system , partially or completely , depending on the designed properties of the gauge fluctuations .",
    "if the gauge field is engineered , by allowing only restricted gauge fluctuations , so that the ground degeneracy is only partially split , then the topological edge modes are modified accordingly , in a controlled and predictable fashion .",
    "there is absolutely no risk of driving the system to a trivial phase purely by restricted gauge fluctuations , unless the gauge field is explicitly designed to do so by allowing for unrestricted gauge fluctuations",
    ". it would be interesting to recast these results in terms of the group cohomology classification of symmetry protected topological quantum orders and bosonic anomalies.@xcite    we have illustrated our ideas with gauged parafermion chains . for generic chains , we performed a symmetry and duality analysis confirming our theoretical predictions . to obtain a more refined picture of the the transmutation of the edge modes and the correlation with critical phenomena",
    ", we investigated numerically the @xmath0 parafermion chain coupled to a @xmath8-like or a @xmath1-like gauge field .",
    "that is , the dynamics of the physically natural @xmath0 gauge field was restricted to achieve a @xmath8-like or @xmath1-like effect . according to our general picture",
    ", the @xmath8-like field should transmute the @xmath0 edge modes of the parafermion chain into @xmath1 edge modes , and we showed numerically that this is the case by computing the period of the supercurrent in a parafermion ring junction as a function of gauge fluctuations .",
    "we also obtained the phase diagram of the gauged parafermion chain as a function of gauge fluctuations and a perturbation driving the system to a trivial phase .",
    "in this two dimensional phase diagram , the transition between the gauge - driven phase with @xmath1 edge modes and the topologically trivial phase occurs on a critical line in the universality class of the @xmath1 parafermion chain . from this point of view , the @xmath8-gauged @xmath0 parafermion chain is indistinguishable from the ungauged @xmath1 chain .",
    "the general picture is the same for the @xmath1-gauged @xmath0 parafermion chain . in this case , the edge modes are majoranas .",
    "let us mention in closing two potential practical applications of our work .",
    "one possibility is to exploit our ideas to create topological qutrits out of @xmath0 parafermions .",
    "qutrits have practical advantages over qubits , not because they can provide qualitatively faster algorithms , but because they can polynomialy shorten the length of an algorithm in the circuit model of quantum computation .",
    "of course , the same holds for six - state quantum bits , but here we have face the problem that very little is known about quantum software design with many - leveled logic .",
    "topological qutrits strike a nice balance from this point of view .",
    "another possibility is to use a gauged @xmath0 parafermion chain as a replacement for a @xmath1 chain .",
    "the @xmath1 parafermion chains is one of the key building blocks in a recent blueprint@xcite for realizing fibonacci anyons .",
    "one difficulty of that blueprint is that , as a building block in this setup , all the chains in a two - dimensional stack must be tuned to their critical point .",
    "by contrast , our realization of the @xmath1 chain out of the @xmath0 chain is critical on a line rather than a point , and the whole line is in the universality class of the @xmath1 chain .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 chain is in principle realizable out of the ( doubled ) @xmath266 fractional quantum hall state , which is the most stable fractional plateau .",
    "we expect that the @xmath8 gauge field for this application might also be engineered out of superconducting phase slips , but the situation is not as simple as for the majorana chain .",
    "the mesoscopic details of engineering the required gauge fields will be the subject of an upcoming publication .",
