    "<S> given a family of probability measures in @xmath0 , the space of probability measures on a hilbert space @xmath1 , our goal in this paper is to highlight one ore more curves in @xmath0 that summarize efficiently that family . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to study this problem under the optimal transport ( wasserstein ) geometry , using curves that are restricted to be geodesic segments under that metric . </S>",
    "<S> we show that concepts that play a key role in euclidean pca , such as data centering or orthogonality of principal directions , find a natural equivalent in the optimal transport geometry , using wasserstein means and differential geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the implementation of these ideas is , however , computationally challenging . to achieve scalable algorithms that can handle thousands of measures </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to use a relaxed definition for geodesics and regularized optimal transport distances . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of our approach is demonstrated on images seen either as shapes or color histograms . </S>"
