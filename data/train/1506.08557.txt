    "schwinger effect in quantum field theory @xcite is the creation of pairs of particles in the presence of a strong electric or magnetic field .",
    "intuitively when the strength of the electric field reaches the string tension between the quark anti - quark , it can break the string that is attaching them and so the virtual pairs can become on - shell and a current can be created .",
    "semenoff and zarembo @xcite first studied the schwinger effect holographically .",
    "then the authors in @xcite and @xcite , using the nambu - goto action on a probe brane and by calculating the free energy and using the first law of thermodynamic , calculated the entanglement entropy of a quark and an anti - quark which are accelerating in an electric field in the @xmath0 background . a similar calculation in a different setup",
    "was also done in @xcite .",
    "so one might want to try this in other backgrounds and specifically in the confining ones .",
    "on the other hand , there are some ideas on how to measure the entanglement entropy in the lab by using the fluctuations of current which is flowing through a quantum point contact as the probe , @xcite @xcite , which still are not quite successful .",
    "another conjecture is that there might be a relation between the schwinger effect and the entanglement entropy .",
    "finding such a relation could be a breakthrough since the schwinger pair creation rate could also act as an entanglement meter in the condensed matter systems .",
    "to explore for such a relation , in the first step , we study the phase diagrams of schwinger effect and of entanglement entropy for four confining geometries ; the witten - qcd , the maldacena - nunez , the klebanov - strassler and the klebanov - tseytlin which are dual to @xmath1 field theories .    for calculating the entanglement entropy for accelerating particles one can use the method in@xcite .",
    "for doing so , first one needs to find the string world sheet profile in these confining backgrounds . for the case of @xmath2 geometry , due to the large amount of symmetries ,",
    "the corresponding pde equation of motion is simple and has been solved in @xcite .",
    "mikhailov also found a simple linear relation @xcite to find the string world sheet profile based on the position of the quark and anti - quark on the boundary that can only be used for the @xmath0 background . for other geometries such as the confining backgrounds",
    "there is no mikhailov - like equation and for finding the string profile one needs to solve several more difficult pde equations analytically which for our supergravity background geometries we present them in section 2 .",
    "we just do the similar calculation for the minkowski background and we find the free energy of the quarks and anti quarks in a flat background in section 3 .    in order to look for a relationship between the phase transitions of schwinger effect and the entanglement entropy , we study the phase transitions in an electric potential similar to the procedures in @xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite in section 4 . by using dbi action",
    ", we calculate the critical electric fields in these geometries where the potential becomes catastrophically unstable and we then find the phase diagrams numerically .",
    "interestingly the phase diagrams of all of these geometries are very similar where three different phases can be detected as has been predicted in @xcite as a universal feature of all confining geometries .",
    "we also compare the diagrams with the conformal case of klebanov - witten which only two phases can be detected .    in section 5",
    "we look at the phase diagrams of the entanglement entropy of a strip , similar to the calculation in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "klebanov , kutasov and murugan found a generalization of ryu - takayanagi relation for the non - conformal geometries @xcite .",
    "then in @xcite , the authors presented the plots of the phase diagram for geometries constructed by dp brane compactified on a circle which are the generalization of the witten - qcd model .",
    "they have found a butterfly shape and a double valuedness in the phase diagram of these confining geometries . in this paper",
    ", we additionally present the phase diagrams of the maldacena - nunez , klebanov - strassler and klebanov - tseytlin plus the klebanov - witten and witten - qcd models by similarly calculating the length of the connected regions and the entanglement entropy of the connected and disconnect solutions .",
    "we also find the similar butterfly shape in the phase diagrams .",
    "we also find that if in a specific geometry the phase transition of schwinger effect is fast and dramatic , this also would be the case in its entanglement entropy phase transition which is the case for wqcd and kt , and if the phase transition for schwinger effect be mild , this also would be the case for its ee phase diagram which is the case for mn and ks .",
    "one can also compare the features with the conformal case of klebanov - witten and ads as a limit of a mild transition .    in section 6",
    ", we study the schwinger effect in the presence of a magnetic field in addition to the electric field and study its effects on the pair creation rate . by adding a probe d8-brane , in @xcite and @xcite the authors studied the imaginary part of the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian , the rate of pair creation , the critical electric field and the effect of the parallel and perpendicular components of the magnetic field on the rate of pair creation in the background of sakai - sugimoto and the deformed sakai - sugimoto models .",
    "similarly we calculate the dbi action and the imaginary part of the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian in our geometries .",
    "we find that in all of our supergravity confining geometries the parallel magnetic field would increase the rate of pair creation while the perpendicular magnetic field would decrease it which should be a general feature of all confining backgrounds .",
    "we then conclude with a discussion in section 7 .",
    "in this section we present the pde equations of the string profiles which can be used in finding the entanglement entropy of accelerating quarks moving on specific trajectories .    as in @xcite , by starting from the nambu - goto action for the @xmath0 geometry , @xmath3,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and then by assuming the static gauge of @xmath4 and the embedding coordinate of @xmath5 , one can find the determinant of the induced metric as @xmath6 and the equation of motion as @xmath7 solving these pde equations , in general is a difficult task , but for the case of @xmath2 which enjoys a lot of symmetries and has a simpler form , the author in @xcite could find the solution and therefore the string profile as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 as @xmath10 if a heavy quark and an anti - quark accelerate on a specific trajectory due to the potential of an electric field , the classical solution from the nambu - goto action is a world sheet that is a part of @xmath11 and the locus of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the mass of the quark and @xmath14 is the electric field . from this relation ,",
    "the world sheet event horizon can be read as @xmath15 . as in @xcite , for a specific trajectory such as a hyperbola",
    ", one can read the metric near the quark trajectory .    alternatively for finding the induced metric on the world sheet , similar to @xcite",
    ", one can use the mikhailov relation between the embedding coordinate @xmath16 and the boundary quark position @xmath17 , @xcite , as @xmath18    then as in @xcite one can find the proper area between the probe brane and the event horizon which is proportional to the free energy . by knowing the unruh temperature that the quarks would feel in the accelerated reference frame in @xmath2 as @xmath19 , and by using the first law of thermodynamics one can read the entropy .",
    "if one can assume the semi - classical and heavy quark limit in the problem , all of those entanglement would be due to the  entanglement entropy \" and so for the ads the ee where found to be @xmath20 , @xcite where @xmath21 is the t hooft coupling constant .",
    "now we look at the equations for the @xmath1 supergravity solutions that are dual to the confining geometries .",
    "one should notice that for this calculation , one first needs the string world sheet profile , the induced metric and the unruh temperature of the accelerating particles in each background which we do nt present here .      between",
    "all the three mentioned confining geometries , the witten qcd model is the most similar background to the ads metric . in the string frame ,",
    "its metric and dilaton field are @xcite , @xmath22 if we consider the static gauge , and the embedding coordinate as @xmath23 , then the equations would be complicated .",
    "so we assume @xmath24 is a constant , and therefore the determinant of the induced metric simplifies to @xmath25 which leads to the following equation of motion , @xmath26 which is quit similar to the ads case . if one finds the analytical solution of this pde equation , similar to the ads case , one can follow the procedures of @xcite and find the entanglement entropy of heavy accelerating quarks in this model .",

    ". then one would get @xmath34 so the equation of motion of the string profile in this background is @xmath35    again by solving this equation analytically one can find the string profile and then the entanglement entropy of heavy accelerating quarks .",
    "the klebanov - tseytin metric is a singular solution which is dual to the chirally symmetric phase of the klebanov - strassler model which has d3 brane charges that dissolve in the flux @xcite .",

    "then @xmath54 and the equation of motion of the string profile would be @xmath55      the klebanov - witten solution is similar to the kt throat solution but with no logarithmic warping @xcite . unlike the other four mentioned metrics , it is a conformal non - confining geometry .",
    "we study this background to compare our results with the conformal case .",
    "the metric is @xmath56 where , @xmath57 the embedding would be @xmath58 with all other coordinates zero .",
    "then @xmath59 and the equation of motion of the string profile is @xmath60    therefore again solving this equation would give the string profile and the induced metric near the accelerating particles trajectory in the background of the conformal kw model .",

    "now the flat geometry can be the uv limit of the hard - wall and witten - qcd model .",
    "therefore for the flat metric @xmath65 one can repeat the calculation of semenoff and hubeny .",
    "so one would have @xmath66 and then the equation of motion is @xmath67 and the solution of this pde can be found as @xmath68 , where as in the previous case , for the accelerating quark and anti - quark , the constant is @xmath69 . from this solution",
    "one can see that the world sheet event horizon is at @xmath15 .",

    "one would think that for searching for any possible relationship between the entanglement entropy and the schwinger pair creation rate , it would be interesting to first find the phase diagrams and the phase transitions for both quantities in few different confining backgrounds .",
    "in @xcite the authors demonstrated some generals features in the phase diagram of schwinger effect in all confining geometries and then in @xcite , they have studied the ",
    "ads soliton geometry \" as a special case . in these papers ,",
    "the authors studied the potential of a confining background and then they have plotted the total potential , @xmath76 versus the distance between the quark and anti quark @xmath77 .",
    "their setup and the world sheet configuration for the quark and anti quark potential is also shown , in figures [ fig : test13a ] and [ test14b ] .",

    "now in the following sections , we do a similar calculation for our class of supergravity confining geometries and then numerically we find the phase diagrams .",
    "first for the witten - qcd model , if we assume that a probe d3-brane is located at @xmath78 and then we assume the following ansatz for the wilson loop ,    @xmath79    the ng action would be @xmath80 as the lagrangian does not depend on @xmath81 , the following hamiltonians are conserved , @xmath82 then there should exist two different minimal surfaces that satisfy the following relations , @xmath83 however by assuming @xmath84 , we consider a rectangular wilson loop which makes the calculation simpler .",
    "so @xmath85 and then from the conservation of @xmath86 we would get , @xmath87 by integrating the above equation one could get the length of the string between the quark and anti quark in wqcd as @xmath88 now by defining the following dimensionless quantities , @xmath89 one can simplify @xmath77 as @xmath90 then the sum of the potential and static energy would be @xmath91 for the large @xmath77 limit , ( @xmath92 ) , the sum of the potential and static energy is @xmath93 so from the first term which is the quark and anti - quark potential , we can read the confining string tension as @xmath94 this matches with the result coming from the relation @xmath95 .",
    "also the second term gives the static mass of the quark and anti - quark , @xmath96    then from the dbi action , one can read the critical electric field for this geometry as @xmath97 now we can define the dimensionless parameter @xmath98 .",
