    "higher - derivative theories of gravity have been attracting much attention in recent years in the context of quantum gravity .",
    "it is known that such higher - derivative theories typically suffer from the ghost instability .",
    "nevertheless , higher - curvature corrections in the low - energy limit of string theory provide higher - derivative terms in the field equations in spite of the ghost - free nature of string theory  @xcite .",
    "this fact could suggest that there exists a class of well - behaved higher - derivative theories of gravity .    in this context ,",
    "the forth - derivative theories of gravity formulated by bergshoeff , hohm , and townsend ( bht ) in 2 + 1 dimensions is quite intriguing as a toy model  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this so - called bht massive gravity is ghost - free around the flat background  @xcite , unitary  @xcite , and renormalizable  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown that the theory suffers from ghosts around the anti - de  sitter ( ads ) background except for the case with a fine - tuning between the coupling constants  @xcite .",
    "( this fine - tuning does not give a degenerate maximally symmetric vacuum but gives the vanishing central charge of the dual theory in the ads / cft context . )    independently , there is another motivation to investigate bht massive gravity .",
    "the bht quadratic lagrangian shares an important property with lovelock lagrangian that is proportional to the trace of the resulting field equations .",
    "this is one of the important properties of lovelock gravity , which is the most general second - order theory of gravity in arbitrary dimensions and contains general relativity as the first - order theory  @xcite .",
    "the similarities between bht massive gravity and the quadratic lovelock gravity , namely gauss - bonnet gravity , have been pointed out by several authors  @xcite . in this sense , bht massive gravity may be considered as the simplest higher - derivative gravity and expected to possess some essential properties , which could be inherited to the higher - dimensional counterpart .",
    "( the cubic counterpart of bht massive gravity in five dimensions was introduced in  @xcite . )",
    "however , because of the complexity of the field equations , it is hard to perform exact analyses or to obtain exact solutions in higher - derivative theories . in bht massive gravity",
    ", the simplest black hole must be the locally ads black hole , namely the baados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is another exact black - hole solution in the theory admitting a single degenerate ( a)ds vacuum  @xcite . in this solution",
    ", there appears another mysterious parameter as a linear term in the btz - type metric function , which causes the slow fall - off to the ads infinity .",
    "the first law of the black - hole thermodynamics for this black hole was studied by considering the non - trivial contribution of the slow fall - off to the thermodynamical quantities  @xcite .    however , dynamical aspects of black holes in bht massive gravity have been totally unclear until now .",

    "<S> using an exact vaidya - type null - dust solution , we study the area and entropy laws for dynamical black holes defined by a future outer trapping horizon in @xmath0-dimensional bergshoeff - hohm - townsend ( bht ) massive gravity . </S>",
