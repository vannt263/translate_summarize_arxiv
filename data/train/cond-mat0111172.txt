    "rna plays a fundamental role in the biochemistry of all living systems  @xcite , and it is commonly believed to be at the origin of the pre - darwinian epoch of life  @xcite .",
    "much like for dna , the rna primary structure can be described in terms of strings of the four letter alphabet composed by adenosine , citosine , guanine , uracile ( ` acgu ` ) . since rna is usually found in the single stranded pattern , formation of double - helix regions is accomplished by the molecule folding back onto itself to form _ watson - crick _ ( wc ) base pairs ` g\\equivc ` and ` a = u ` , or the slightly less stable ` g - u ` pair .",
    "one of the most intriguing features of rna folded secondary structures is that in most cases the connectivity graph is planar : this property greatly reduces the computational efforts needed for calculating the ground state structure .",
    "it might be asked whether secondary structures provide an adequate level of description for rna real molecules  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that secondary structure description is biologically relevant for a number of reasons : base pairing and base pair stacking provide the major part of the free energy of folding  @xcite , secondary structures have been used successfully by biologists in the interpretation of rna function and activity  @xcite , and because structures are conserved in evolutionary phylogeny . at the same time computer scientists find this level of description rather appealing since secondary structures are discrete and therefore easy to compare .",
    "moreover , thanks to the planarity condition , efficient recursive algorithms for the computation of the native ( ground state ) structure are easily implemented  @xcite .    beside the genuine biological interest of rna models , recently this subject has raised considerable attention as an intriguing problem in statistical mechanics of disordered systems .",
    "the focus is now set on the presence and the nature of a low temperature phase in ensembles of random sequences . in a series of recent papers",
    "different authors have presented a number of evidences ( mostly numerical ) supporting the existence of a transition to a glassy phase ( for a review see ref .",
    "while a careful study of the equilibrium thermodynamics of the model suggests a smoother than second order phase transition  @xcite , there is still much debate about the nature of the low temperature phase , since finite size scaling corrections are very hard to keep under control .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that , at least for systems up to 1000 bases , a broad overlap distribution characterizes the low temperature phase , but a safe extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit from the available data is still out of control  @xcite .",
    "bundschuh and hwa  @xcite have presented an extensive study on a variety of similar rna models supporting the existence of a low temperature glassy phase .",
    "they were able to show analytically , via a two replica calculation , that weak quenched sequence disorder is equivalent to a high temperature phase in which all replicas are independent ( molten phase ) , and that there must be a finite temperature below which replicas start feeling themselves as in a strong coupling regime .",
    "numerically the authors established this glassy transition measuring the free energy cost of imposing a pinch between two bases .",
    "they observed that the energy of the pinching excitation ( with respect to the ground state ) increases with the sequence length following a logarithmic law ( even if a power law with small exponent was not excluded ) .",
    "in this paper we study the scaling regime of the lowest energy excitations in different models of random rna secondary structures .",
    "following an idea put forward in  @xcite , we use a perturbing method @xcite which has been very valuable in the study of low temperature properties of disordered systems  @xcite : in the following we will call it the _ @xmath1-coupling method_. very recently the same procedure has been followed by krzakala , mzard and mller  @xcite .",
    "we will comment on their results in the concluding section after having presented our data .",
    "the goal of the @xmath1-coupling method is to calculate the energy cost of typical excitations above the ground state involving a finite fraction of the system . as in the droplet model",
    "@xcite these energy excitations are assumed to scale as @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the length of the molecule , and @xmath4 being a relevant exponent , that we would like to determine .",
    "it is well possible that also the local pinching of coupled replicas imposed in  @xcite would generate `` typical '' configurations , but we believe that our method based on a bulk perturbation will surely do so ( in this sense we find very illuminating its application ) .",
    "we apply a perturbation that is simply a repulsion term from the ground state structure , which forces the system to find new low - energy structures far away from the one of the original ground state , without any other constraint .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : models ] we introduce the formalism for describing the rna secondary structure and the different ways we have used to remove the ground state degeneracy intrinsic to the original model  @xcite . in section  [ sec : methods ] we sketch the method we have applied for calculating the low - energy spectrum of the model .",
    "we also discuss the measurable observables . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our results , focusing on the differences and similarities among the models we have introduced .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize our findings , we compare with previous work and we comment on further developments .",
    "the secondary structure of rna is the set of base pairs that occur in its three - dimensional structure .",
    "let us define a sequence of basis as @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the @xmath7 base of the chain and @xmath8 . a secondary structure on @xmath9 is now defined as a set @xmath10 of @xmath11 pairs ( with the convention that @xmath12 ) satisfying the following rules :    * @xmath13 : this restriction permits flexibility of the chain in its three - dimensional arrangement ; * two different base pairs @xmath14 if and only if ( without loss of generality we can assume that @xmath15 ) @xmath16 , i.e.   the pair @xmath11 precedes @xmath17 , or @xmath18 , i.e.   the pair @xmath11 includes @xmath17 .",
    "this rule , called _ planarity condition _ , excludes the occurrence of the so - called _ pseudo - knots _ , which are very unlikely in real rna .",
    "we consider a simplified model for rna folding , very similar to the one studied in  @xcite .",
    "the model is described in terms of the hamiltonian : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pairing energy between bases @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the variable @xmath23 takes value 1 if @xmath24 and 0 otherwise . on a first approximation",
    "one can assume that the pairing energies depend only on the paired bases , @xmath25 .",
    "reasonable values for the energies @xmath26 of the allowed base pairs ( ` c - g ` , ` a - u ` and ` g - u ` ) at room temperature are of @xmath27 kcal / mole",
    ". one could consider other phenomenological parameters in order to take into account the whole complexity of a realistic energy function  @xcite .",
    "we have assumed a drastic approximation in order to get a tractable model both from a numerical and analytical point of view .",
    "we consider sequences made of @xmath28 symbols ( ` a ` , ` c ` , ` g ` and ` u ` ) and we assume that only watson - crick base pairs may occur : we use a strong ` c - g ` coupling of energy @xmath29 ( in arbitrary units ) and a weak ` a - u ` coupling of energy @xmath30 .",
    "all the other possible couplings increase the energy , so that the system avoids these links .",
    "one of the advantages of this model is that the role of the disorder ( encoded in the random sequence @xmath9 ) is clearly separated from that of the frustration ( induced by the planarity condition on the structure @xmath10 ) .",
    "this @xmath28 letters model has an exponentially large ground state degeneracy , which gives a finite @xmath31 entropy ( as already found in  @xcite for the @xmath32 letters model ) .",
    "for this reason we refer to it as the degenerate model ( the * d model * ) .",
    "the large ground state degeneracy that occurs in this d model is a pathology of a frustrated models with simple discrete interactions : since the couplings can take only the two negative values @xmath29 and @xmath30 the same exact energetic situation can be realized in many ways . this",
    "_ accidental degeneracy _ will probably not play a relevant role in the physical rna : since real rna energy function is far more complex than that , ground state degeneracy is unlikely to occur . because of that we define two new models with modified pairing energies , in order to remove the degeneracy . in both models",
    "this aim is accomplished by adding a small random perturbing term @xmath33 to the pairing energies : @xmath34 .    in the quasi - degenerate model ( the * qd model * ) the @xmath33 are i.i.d .",
    "variables extracted from a gaussian distribution of zero mean @xmath35 and variance @xmath36 , with @xmath37 a small and finite constant of the order of @xmath38 : when @xmath39 the pairing energies are modified of an infinitesimal amount .",
    "the variance is chosen such that the energies of the ground states ( which are degenerate for @xmath40 ) are split over an @xmath41 range . in this way",
    "we preserve somehow the structure of the original energy spectrum and the sequence still plays a key role , but the unphysical degeneracy is lifted and the ground state is now unique .    in the non - degenerate model ( the * nd model * )",
    "the variance of the @xmath33 variables is finite , @xmath42 ( we use @xmath43 ) .",
    "this variance induces an @xmath44 splitting of the degenerated ground states , which has to be considered as a strong reshuffling of the original energy spectrum , since the energy gaps among levels in the original model were of @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting energy landscape now depends very little on the sequence .",
    "because of that the nd model is very similar to the `` gaussian disorder model '' ( the * gd model * ) , already discussed in  @xcite , where the @xmath20 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian variables of zero mean and unitary variance . in this model",
    "the sequence plays no role .",
    "the @xmath1-coupling method we use to calculate low - energy excitations is the one already used in  @xcite and in  @xcite .",
    "it works as follows : first of all one calculates the ground state structure @xmath45 which minimizes @xmath46 .",
    "then one adds a perturbation to the hamiltonian , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the overlap with the ground state structure ( note that , with this definition , the overlap is always positive ) .",
    "the perturbation term penalizes the structures which are close to the ground state @xmath49 and thus acts as a repulsive term in the space of structures .",
    "finally one calculates the ground state structure of @xmath50 for many values of @xmath1 .",
    "let us call these new structures @xmath51 .    by definition , for any disorder realization @xmath52 ,",
    "both the distance @xmath53 as well as the energy difference @xmath54 between @xmath51 and @xmath49 are non - decreasing functions of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover @xmath55 , since the hamiltonian has been perturbed by a term whose absolute value is less than @xmath1 , and the structures @xmath51 are then low energy excited states of the original hamiltonian .",
    "we will indicate without the @xmath56 subscript the observables averaged over the quenched disorder @xmath52 : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the algorithm for finding the new ground states of @xmath1-coupled system is exactly the same one used for the original hamiltonian : the repulsion from the first ground state is included by modifying the values of the original pairing energies @xmath20 .    in the thermodynamical limit structures differing by a finite @xmath59",
    "have the same intensive energy , and one could try to understand how they are organized in the configurational space .",
    "an interesting question is whether , in the large @xmath3 limit , these structures are extremely close together or spread over finite distances .",
    "the answer to this question can be given in terms of the asymptotic quantity @xmath60 which is again a non - decreasing function of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath61 for any finite @xmath1 then structures with the same energy are close together , while if @xmath62 for @xmath63 then structures with the same intensive energy may have a broad probability distribution functions of their distances and overlaps .    in the case where @xmath61 we can derive a relation describing the way @xmath64 vanishes",
    "we assume , as in the droplet model  @xcite , that the energy cost of a typical excitation involving a finite fraction of the system ( i.e.   having finite @xmath65 ) scales with the system size as @xmath66 we call @xmath67 the probability distribution ( over the disorder ) of excitations with energy @xmath68 and size @xmath69 in systems of size @xmath3 . for any fixed and finite",
    "@xmath70 $ ] , we assume that @xmath67 has a finite weight in @xmath71 , and so , for normalization reasons , we must have @xmath72 for large @xmath3 ( unless there is a delta function in @xmath73 as in the d model ) , where @xmath74 is a smooth function in the scaling region .",
    "once we add the perturbing term @xmath75 to the hamiltonian , an excitation of size @xmath65 will be activated only if its energy satisfies @xmath76 .",
    "thus the average distance of the new ground state structure is given by @xmath77 for small @xmath1 and large @xmath3  , since , for a finite range of @xmath65 values , its @xmath67 has a delta function in @xmath73 that implies the presence of a gap ( energy levels are discretized ) , so that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ave_dist ] ) is finite for any @xmath3 and @xmath1 small enough . ]",
    ".    then we can evaluate the @xmath4 exponent by two independent ways :    * from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ave_dist ] ) , @xmath78 , by measuring the average distance @xmath64 for a fixed small @xmath1 as a function of the system size @xmath3 ; * from eq .",
    "( [ eq : typ_ener ] ) , which can be equivalently rewritten for the average energy difference as @xmath79 by measuring the average energy difference for a fixed distance ( not fixed @xmath1 ! ) as a function of the system size @xmath3 .",
    "we study zero - temperature properties of the models described above , i.e.   we analyze ground states structures ( gss ) of the original and of the perturbed hamiltonians .",
    "we start showing the data for the @xmath31 overlap distribution in the d model ( the only one with many different ground states ) .",
    "after that we present the results obtained with the @xmath1-coupling method for all the models defined in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "the d model possesses an exponentially large number of gss , which form a set that we call @xmath80 . in order to understand how they are distributed in the space of structures",
    "one can calculate the probability distribution function of the overlap , which is defined , for any pair of structures , as @xmath81 .",
    "unfortunately the zero - temperature entropy of the d model is too large in order to list all the ground state structures for values of @xmath3 large enough to be interesting . because of",
    "that we have added to the d model a further constraint , suggested by observations on biological rna , which strongly reduces the entropy while keeping the @xmath82 very similar in shape to the one of the unconstrained model .",
    "we avoid structures where a single base pairs is surrounded by non - paired bases , that is a structure with @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 is forbidden .",
    "the overlap distribution , averaged over @xmath86 samples , is shown in figure  [ pq ] .",
    "is worth noticing that the tail for small values of @xmath87 is disappearing very slowly with increasing system size . the peak location as well as the mean overlap",
    "converge somewhere around @xmath88 , while the variance decreases with the system size approximately as @xmath89 .",
    "so the @xmath82 seems to converge , in the thermodynamic limit , to a delta function centered on a value of @xmath87 smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "such a value is compatible with the observation that in a typical ground state structure the paired bases are a finite fraction ( smaller than @xmath90 ) of all bases .",
    "nevertheless , as already explained in  @xcite , the triviality of the @xmath82 at zero temperature does not imply a trivial behavior of the whole low - temperature phase , and so we resort to the study of low - energy density of states .",
    "we have calculated the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath50 for @xmath91 values of @xmath92 $ ] ( equally spaced on a logarithmic scale ) , and many @xmath3 values .",
    "we have analyzed a minimum of @xmath93 disorder realizations for the largest chain ( @xmath94 ) , and a maximum of circa @xmath95 samples for the smallest one ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "versus @xmath1 for different chain lengths @xmath3 in the degenerate d model . ]",
    "the first gss @xmath49 is chosen with uniform probability in @xmath80 ( the set of all the degenerate ground states of the d model ) .",
    "when we switch on the perturbation the new gss will be the one in @xmath80 having the smallest overlap with @xmath49 .",
    "nothing else will change as long as @xmath97 , that is as long as @xmath1 is not large enough to make an excited state with @xmath98 to become the new gss .",
    "this explains the plateau for @xmath97 in figure  [ d_de ] , where we show the average distance between @xmath49 and @xmath51 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the main information we get from figure  [ d_de ] is the value of the plateau distance @xmath99 , corresponding to an overlap @xmath100 .",
    "this distance can be viewed as the radius of a sphere containing the set @xmath80 of all the gss .",
    "note that the gss are not uniformly distributed in this sphere [ otherwise the @xmath82 would be peaked on a much smaller overlap value ] , but they are very dense in the central region and very sparse on the boundaries .",
    "this means that if one chooses two gss at random they will typically be very close in the dense region , giving a value of @xmath101 , but if one forces the two gss to be as far as possible the resulting minimum overlap @xmath102 will be much smaller , and will depend strongly on the specific disorder realization [ see figure  [ pqmin ] , where we plot its probability distribution @xmath103 .     of the minimum overlap among any two gss in the degenerate d model .",
    "]    as it is made clear by the results shown in figure  [ d_de ] , for models with high degeneracy the perturbing method does not work properly in the interesting region of small @xmath1 , giving only information about the minimal overlap among gss .",
    "now we remove the degeneracy and analyze the other models .",
    "we have defined the qd model such as to keep as much as possible of the degenerate d model , even after removal of the accidental degeneracy . here",
    "we can still distinguish two different regimes ( see figure  [ qd_de ] , where we plot the average distance @xmath104 as a function of @xmath1 for different chain lengths @xmath3 ) : for @xmath105 the data coincide with those for the ( unconstrained ) d model , while for @xmath97 they have now a non trivial behavior .     for the qd model . ]    in the interesting region of small @xmath1 the scaling of the data is very subtle and good results can be obtained either with @xmath106 or with @xmath107 .",
    "our finite size scaling analysis does not allow us to reach a quantitative estimate , and we can not distinguish in a statistically significant way among a power law ( droplet like ) scaling and a logarithmic scaling .",
    "further and longer studies are needed to understand better this model .    despite the difficulties in the data analysis , we believe that the qd model has a large interest and relevance . indeed it has the great advantage of a single non - degenerate ground state , but still the perturbation added in order to remove the original degeneracy modifies the energies of the structures by a quantity of order @xmath108 , thus keeping a large amount of information about the original energy landscape of the degenerate d model of rna .      in the nd model",
    "the ground state degeneracy has been removed by a random term which strongly reshuffles the energy levels .     for the nd model . ]     as a function of the rescaled variable @xmath109 for different values of @xmath3 in the nd model . ]    in figure  [ nd_dens ] we show the average distance @xmath110 for some values of @xmath1 and @xmath3 ( the error is of the order of the symbol size ) .",
    "data are now smooth functions of @xmath1 , with no singular point at @xmath111 , and a finite size scaling analysis can be performed in an easier way .    following eq .",
    "( [ eq : ave_dist ] ) we have rescaled the data plotting them versus @xmath109 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ nd_des ] , where we have included all data points .",
    "the best collapse is achieved when using @xmath112 .",
    "the dotted line has unitary slope and clearly shows that @xmath113 for small @xmath1 and any fixed @xmath3 .",
    "we notice that we are looking for a finite size scaling that works well only up to a given value of @xmath114 : the method we are using is based on the idea of having a `` small '' perturbation that acts as a probe .",
    "very large values of @xmath1 drastically change the hamiltonian and the energy landscape .",
    "it is interesting to note that the scaling seems to work well up to @xmath115 , that is the radius of the ball of degenerate ground states in the original d model .",
    "the physical interpretation of this result is the following .",
    "for any fixed @xmath1 the scaling variable @xmath109 vanishes in the thermodynamical limit , which implies that the unperturbed ground state is stable against this kind of perturbation . in order to have a different and more complex behavior one should perturb the original hamiltonian by a term whose amplitude increases with the size at least as fast as @xmath116 .",
    "the energy scale @xmath116 can thus be interpreted as the energy cost for reaching the first excited state .     between the unperturbed and the perturbed ground state structures as a function of their average distance @xmath65 for different @xmath3 values in the nd model .",
    "]     rescaled according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ave_ener ] ) . ]    a still clearer picture of this phenomenon is given in figure  [ nd_edns ] , where we plot the average energy difference @xmath117 as a function of the average distance @xmath64 between the unperturbed and the perturbed ground states .",
    "it is evident that , for any fixed distance , the energy difference is growing with the system size , according to the argument given above .",
    "we have rescaled the data following equation  ( [ eq : ave_ener ] ) and the results are shown in figure  [ nd_eds ] . again",
    "the best collapse is achieved for @xmath118 , in perfect agreement with the previous analysis . also here",
    "the scaling region extends over distances up to @xmath119 . for small distances the average energy increases as @xmath120 ( see the dotted line in figure  [ nd_eds ] )",
    "the same behavior has been observed also in the qd model and we will present a simple explanation in the next subsection , dedicated to the gd model .    since the value of the @xmath4 exponent is small we also tried to fit the data under the assumption @xmath121 , that is @xmath106 .",
    "this behavior is suggested by mean - field solutions of disordered models  @xcite and more particularly from previous findings on similar models  @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that a logarithmic fit with @xmath122 still works rather well , but definitely the power law fit with @xmath123 is more accurate and always has a smaller @xmath124 value .      under the application of the @xmath1-coupling perturbation",
    ", the gd model behaves very similarly to the nd model in that :    * all the data perfectly collapse with @xmath0 ; * for small @xmath1 , @xmath125 ; * for small @xmath65 , @xmath126 .",
    "moreover the results listed here do not depend on the presence of the constraint @xmath127 for @xmath128 ( see section  [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "these findings imply that we have at hand a very simplified model which share the same phenomenology with more realistic models and which is more amenable to an analytical treatment . for sake of clarity",
    "we recall its definition : we have an hamiltonian of the form given in equation  ( [ eq : ham ] ) , where the pairing energies @xmath129 are @xmath130 independent gaussian variables with zero mean and unitary variance , and the @xmath23 satisfy the planarity condition .    within this model",
    "it is easier , for example , to understand the behavior @xmath126 for small @xmath65 .",
    "first of all we observe from numerical simulations that in a typical gss @xmath131 the fraction of paired bases is @xmath132 and the distribution of the pairing energies @xmath20 of the active links , the ones with @xmath133 , can be very well approximated by a gaussian of negative mean and finite width ( the distribution is truncated since positive pairing energies are forbidden in the gss ) .",
    "let us call the distribution of the pairing energies absolute values @xmath134 .",
    "the only property we need for the proof is a _",
    "finite _ weight in zero , @xmath135 , and this is the case for the gd model ( and also for the nd model ) .",
    "now we construct a sequence of structures @xmath136 such that @xmath126 for small @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath136 is obtained from @xmath131 removing the @xmath137 weakest links , i.e.   those with the smallest ( in absolute value ) pairing energies .",
    "so the distance between @xmath131 and @xmath136 is @xmath138 and the energy difference @xmath68 is the sum of the smallest ( in absolute value ) @xmath137 pairing energies . for large @xmath3 we can write @xmath139 where the last equality only holds for small @xmath140 . the upper integration limit @xmath140",
    "is chosen such that @xmath137 pairing energies , or equivalently a fraction @xmath141 of pairing energies , are summed , that is @xmath142 where the last equation is valid for small @xmath140 . combining the above equations we obtain @xmath126 .",
    "since we have chosen a sequence of structures which are not guaranteed to have the lowest possible energies , we can only argue that @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "nevertheless from numerical simulations the exponent turns out to be exactly @xmath32 ( see figure  [ nd_eds ] ) .    in this very simplified gd model",
    "we can make one more analytical prediction , regarding the fraction of paired bases in the gss .",
    "the number of planar structures with a fraction @xmath145 of paired bases can be easily calculated with the help of generating functions and turns out to be given by @xmath146 $ ] , with an intensive entropy @xmath147 @xmath148 has a maximum for @xmath149 , with @xmath150 .",
    "let us now fix @xmath145 and see how the energies of the @xmath146 $ ] structures are distributed .",
    "they look random , but actually , since the independent gaussian random variables are only @xmath130 , there must be many correlations among them .",
    "since any of these energies is the sum of @xmath151 random gaussian pairing energies , we make the approximation that the distribution of structure energies is also gaussian with a variance proportional to @xmath152 , i.e.   @xmath153 $ ] .",
    "the evaluation of the coefficient @xmath154 is out of our present scopes .",
    "given , for any fixed @xmath145 , the number of structures and the distribution of the energies , we can estimate the most probable lowest energy @xmath155 through @xmath156 where the last equality holds because @xmath157 is negative and large .",
    "the above equation implies @xmath158 . in order to find the fraction of paired bases corresponding to the gss one has to minimize @xmath155 , or equivalently",
    "maximize @xmath159 , over @xmath145 .",
    "such an extremum is achieved for @xmath160 to be compared with the fraction of paired bases found numerically @xmath161 .",
    "the rather small discrepancy tells us that the approximation made on the form of the structure energies distribution @xmath162 is not so bad .",
    "we compare the ground state energy of the gd model ( below ) with the one reached by a simple greedy algorithm ( above ) .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond to the infinite size extrapolations . ]",
    "the apparent correctness of such a simple approximation could suggest that the gd model has a trivial energy landscape .",
    "we have checked for this possibility with the following method : in a trivial energy landscape any reasonably smart greedy algorithm should be able to reach , or at least to closely approach , the ground state energy .",
    "we have used a greedy algorithm which builds up the structure in the following way : it starts with a structure with no links , at each step it chooses the lowest negative pairing energy ( largest in absolute value ) among the set of those allowed by the planarity condition , and adds the corresponding link to the growing structure . using this greedy algorithm we can reach the energies shown in figure  [ greedy ] which are more than 10% higher than the corresponding ground state energies .",
    "so , it seems that finding a structure with low energy in linear time is not an easy task .",
    "this suggests a complex energy landscape .",
    "a deeper analysis is obviously needed in order to say how much complex the energy landscape of the gd model is .",
    "our results allow to describe a clear and simple physical picture for the rna - inspired models studied here .",
    "all of them possess a glassy phase at low enough temperatures ( since we have analyzed very low energy density of states we can not make predictions on the location of the critical temperature ) .",
    "we can claim that our study clearly selects a positive @xmath4 exponent value for all cases but for the quasi degenerate qd model , where our numerical results are not precise enough to allow us quantitative statements .    at variance with the results of  @xcite we find that in the non - degenerate nd model the broken phase does not look marginal , but a standard droplet glassy phase with @xmath163 .",
    "our way of analyzing the data allows us to exclude ( with good confidence ) a simple logarithmic divergence of the energy difference between ground state and excited states . on this issue",
    "we agree with the results of  @xcite : the difference in the estimate we give for @xmath4 , as compared to the @xmath164 of @xcite , is probably due to the different fitting procedure , and to the number of free parameters used in the fit .    the @xmath4 exponent we find is perfectly compatible with that for directed polymers in random media in 1 + 1 dimensions  @xcite , @xmath165 . since the two models have some similarities this relation could indeed hide a deep connection .",
    "the degenerate d model and the quasi degenerate qd model we have defined above are maybe the less trivial and the most intriguing from the theoretical point of view .",
    "unfortunately we were not able to determine accurately the asymptotic scaling behavior in the latter .",
    "it is probable , on the contrary , that the most part of the analytic developments will be obtained for the gaussian disorder gd model , that is by far the simplest among all the models with a non - trivial behavior .",
