    "strongly correlated electron systems , the systems where the interaction between electrons is larger than their kinetic energy , are intensively studied nowadays .",
    "heavy fermion compounds  @xcite , high @xmath0 cuprates  @xcite , magnetic oxides such as manganites  @xcite , cobaltites , and many others , belong to this class of materials . in theoretical study ,",
    "the hubbard model and its modifications such as @xmath1 model and others are widely used to explain the complex behavior of strongly correlated materials . the main problem arising in the analysis of the hubbard - like hamiltonians",
    "is the absence of reliable analytical methods at large electron - electron interaction .",
    "the numerical studies such as monte - carlo simulations and exact diagonalization on small clusters have large computational costs .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a huge number of different approximate methods not requiring time - consuming calculations .",
    "however , each of these methods has a restricted range of applicability , and it is not always clear whether the results obtained by this or that approximation reveal an actual physics or just reflect the features of initial assumptions .",
    "the simple example of the models of correlated electrons is the falicov - kimball model .",
    "it was proposed in seminal paper of l.m .",
    "falicov and j.c .",
    "kimball , @xcite , to describe the metal to insulator transition in rare - earth and transition - metal compounds .",
    "it includes both itinerant and localized electrons with on - site interaction between them .",
    "this model exhibits many interesting features such as non fermi - liquid behavior  @xcite for any value of coupling constant @xmath2 , charge - density wave phase  @xcite , and phase separation  @xcite .",
    "the falicov - kimball model has been studied both numerically with monte - carlo simulations and exact diagonalization  @xcite , and by using different approximations  @xcite .",
    "several exact results have been obtained also , such as the existence of the phase separation at large coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "the phase separation is a quite ubiquitous phenomenon in the strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "it manifests itself in different situations ( both in experiment and theory ) , where the itinerancy of charge carriers competes with their tendency to the localization .",
    "however , revealing the phase separation in a given system or model is not a trivial task , which usually demands a lot of numerical and analytical work .",
    "the first most reasonable step is the using of the analytical mean - field type approximations , which do not require laborious computations .",
    "if we reveal the tendency to the phase separation in the framework of these approximations , a problem arises , whether this result is an artefact of the approximation , or it captures the main physics and remains qualitatively unchanged in a more refined ( but much more cumbersome ) approximations such as dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) or in numerical simulations .    to address this problem , in this paper i use as a testing ground the falicov - kimball model for which the dmft results are quite transparent and compare dmft with the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "more precisely , i analyse the hubbard - i and dmft approximations of the spinless falicov - kimball model in three dimensions in the strong @xmath2 limit .",
    "the hubbard - i approximation  @xcite first proposed for the hubbard model can be applied to the falikov - kimball model as well  @xcite .",
    "this is a simple mean - filed - like scheme , which allows to obtain analytical results .",
    "although this approximation fails for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bandwidth of itinerant electrons , it can be considered as a good approximation at large @xmath2 .",
    "a more advanced approach , dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite , has been applied first to the falicov - kimball model in  @xcite , and has been considered later in many theoretical papers ( for a review , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation takes into account the local correlations more rigourously , but at the same time it requires more computation costs . here",
    "i show that for strong coupling , @xmath5 , both approximations give similar results for the band structure of itinerant electrons , the evolution of the system with doping , and the region of the phase separation .",
    "after this , i analyze the possibility of the phase separation for a more general model , where ` localized ' electrons have a finite bandwidth @xmath6 .",
    "this model can be considered as a two band hubbard model for spinless fermions .",
    "the itineracy of ` localized ' electrons makes dmft calculations much more cumbersome in comparison to that for the falicov - kimball model . but",
    "again , both approximations give similar results for the range of the phase separation .",
    "it is shown that the phase separation for this model exists when @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , although the hubbard - i and dmft approximations give slightly different values for the @xmath9 .",
    "this correlates well with the result of  @xcite , where the phase separation in the spin-@xmath10 two - band hubbard model is shown in the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "so , the results presented in this paper indicate that the phase separation phenomenon is the inherent feature of multiband hubbard models with wide and narrow bands , and not an artefact of this or that approximation scheme .",
    "the hamiltonian of the falicov - kimball ( fk ) model is  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are creation ( annihilation ) spinless fermion operators for the band and localized electrons , respectively .",
    "the first term in  ( [ hfk ] ) describes the kinetic energy of the band electrons , the second term controls the position of the localized level with respect to the center of the conduction band , while the third term corresponds to the on - site interaction between the band and localized electrons . in further analysis",
    "i will consider attractive interaction with @xmath18 .",
    "the hubbard - i approximation is based on the decoupling in the system of equations for the electrons green s functions .",
    "the use of matsubara green s functions is more convenient to study the system at finite temperatures .",
    "it also allows simply comparing the hubbard - i and dmft approximations , since dmft deals with matsubara one - particle green s functions .",

    "the one - particle green s function of the @xmath34-electrons @xmath35 is obtained in the same manner .",
    "the result for @xmath36 in the hubbard - i approximation is @xmath37 the @xmath34-electrons green s function remains local , but the localized level splits into two sublevels corresponding to sites occupied by or free of @xmath19-electrons .",

    "the knowledge of one - particle green s functions allows to evaluate the thermodynamics quantities of the system .",
    "the average number of @xmath19-electrons is given by the relation @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the volume of the first brillouin zone .",
