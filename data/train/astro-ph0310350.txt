    "a new type of sub - luminous and extremely compact `` dwarf galaxy '' has recently been discovered in an `` all - object '' spectroscopic survey centred on the fornax cluster of galaxies ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2000 ) . while objects with this type of _ morphology _ have been observed before  the bright compact objects discovered by hilker et al . 1999  and the very luminous globular clusters around cd galaxies ( harris , pritchet , & mcclure 1995 )  in this particular case they have been found to be members of the fornax cluster , have intrinsic sizes of only @xmath0 100pc , and have absolute @xmath1band magnitudes ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3mag .",
    "hence drinkwater et al . have named them `` ultra - compact dwarf '' ( ucd ) galaxies .",
    "importantly , the luminosities of ucds are intermediate between those of globular clusters and small dwarf galaxies and are similar to those of the bright end of the luminosity function of the nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticals .    radial distribution , orbital velocity dispersion , and metallicity distribution of ucds are suggested to provide valuable information on the difference in formation histories between ucds , icgcs , and icss ( bekki et al .",
    "the `` galaxy threshing '' scenario ( bekki et al . 2001 ) has predicted that only luminous de , ns with highly eccentric orbits and small pericenter distance from the center of a cluster can become ucds after the outer dwarf envelopes are completed stripped by the cluster tidal field .",
    "icgcs and icss have been demonstrated to form via tidal stripping of gcs and stars from cluster member galaxies ( bekki et al .",
    "2003b ) . here",
    "we reinvestigate the formation of ucds / icgcs / icss by using numerical simulations with larger number of particles ( up to @xmath4 ) to understand ( 1 ) how the formation histories of ucds depend on the structure of de , ns ( in particular , the central density of their dark matter halos , i.e. , cores vs cusp ) , ( 2 ) the dynamical evolution of gcs in des orbiting the fornax cluster , ( 3 ) whether these gcs can become ucds in the center of des via merging of gcs .",
    "the details of the models for the fornax cluster are given in bekki et al .",
    "( 2003a ) and thus we briefly summarize the results here .",
    "figures 1 and 2 summarize the dynamical evolution of the de , n model with @xmath5 = @xmath6 mag , the nfw dark matter halo , and the nuclear mass fraction of 0.05 ( referred to as the fiducial model , fo1 ) . as the de , n approaches the pericenter of its orbit , the strong global tidal field of the fornax cluster stretches the envelope of the den along the direction of the dwarf s orbit and consequently tidally strips the stars of the envelope ( @xmath7gyr ) .",
    "the dark matter halo , which is more widely distributed than the envelope due to its larger core radius , is also efficiently removed from the de , n during the pericenter passage . since the envelope ( and the dark matter halo ) loses a significant fraction of its mass during the passage of the pericenter , the envelope becomes more susceptible to the tidal effects of the fornax cluster after the pericenter passage .",
    "therefore , each subsequent time the dwarf approaches the pericenter , it loses an increasingly larger fraction of its stellar envelope through tidal stripping ( compare , for example , the @xmath8 and @xmath9gyr time points ) .",
    "consequently , both the envelope and the dark matter halo become smaller , less massive , and more diffuse after five passages of the pericenter ( @xmath10gyr ) .",
    "the stripped stars form a long tidal stream of icss along the `` rosette '' orbit within the orbital plane ( @xmath7gyr ) and the icss can have metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath11 for @xmath12 = 1 for the de , n . the central nucleus , on the other hand ,",
    "is just weakly influenced by the tidal force as a result of its compact configuration .",
    "because of its strongly self - gravitating nature , the nucleus loses only a small amount ( @xmath13% ) of its mass and thus maintains its compact morphology during its tidal interaction with the fornax cluster . as a result , a very compact stellar system with a negligible amount of dark matter is formed from the de , n by @xmath14gyr .",
    "the total mass and size of the remnant are @xmath0 3.8 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath0 100 pc ( five times the core or scale radius ) ,",
    "consistent with the observed properties of a ucd .",
    "hence this new study , based on fully self - consistent numerical models of de , ns , confirms the earlier results of bekki et al .",
    "( 2001 ) based on a more simplistic model .",
    "our simulations on gc merging in des / dis have found the following interesting results : ( 1 ) galactic nuclei or ucds formed by @xmath18 gc merging form a scaling relation that is different both from gcs and es ( figure 3 ) , ( 2 ) the shapes of the developed nuclei or ucds depends on the host dwarf s luminosity in the sense that brighter des have more spherical nuclei / ucds , ( 3 ) the brighter des are more likely to be transformed into de , ns , ( 4 ) the gcs in the outer part of des ( @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 ) are likely to be stripped to form icgcs within a few gyr ( thus only central gcs can be merged into the nuclei / ucds ) , and ( 5 ) structure and kinematical properties of these icgc systems depend on the orbital properties of their host dwarfs .    the present set of numerical simulations suggest that morphological evolution of des / dis with gcs can be different between these after they enter into a cluster environment : some of them can be transformed into de , ns via gc merging in their central regions , if initial distributions of their gcs are more centrally concentrated . such newly formed de , ns can be furthermore transformed into ucds due to the strong cluster tidal field , if it has lower dark matter density , highly eccentric orbits , and small pericenter distance .",
    "if de / dis with gcs have more diffusely distributed gc systems , their gcs are tidally stripped to form icgcs with the host dwarfs @xmath22 decreasing significantly .",
    "some fraction of the observed icss can originate from the disrupted des and de , ns ( by galaxy threshing ) in a cluster so that the spatial distribution , kinematics , and metallicity distribution of these icss reflect the orbital evolution and the disruption process of these dwarfs in the cluster .",
    "thus we need to understand first the dynamical evolution of low luminosity cluster dwarfs , which are numerous and more susceptible to disruption by cluster global tidal field ( and thus one of major sources of intracluster stellar objects ) in order to understand the origin of ucds , icgcs , and icss ."
