    "the spatially integrated hard x - ray spectrum @xmath4 ( photons  @xmath5  s@xmath6  kev@xmath6 at the earth ) is produced by bremsstrahlung of accelerated electrons , characterized ( brown , emslie , & kontar 2003 ) by a _",
    "mean electron flux spectrum _ @xmath7 ( electrons  @xmath5  s@xmath6  kev@xmath6 at the sun ) and related to @xmath4 through    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the bremsstrahlung cross - section ( @xmath10  kev@xmath6 ) differential in photon energy , @xmath11  au , and the mean target density @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) is defined by @xmath14 .",
    "bremsstrahlung in the energy range @xmath15  kev is produced by energetic electrons scattering off both protons / ions and electrons ( both free and bound in atoms ) ; these contributions are summed to give the total differential bremsstrahlung cross - section @xmath9 .    for electron energies",
    "@xmath16  kev , the contribution from electron - electron bremsstrahlung can be safely ignored ( haug 1975 ) . however , for higher energies this is no longer the case .",
    "generally , for a given electron spectrum , the additional electron - electron bremsstrahlung yield acts to flatten ( harden ) the photon spectrum in this energy range ( see , e.g. , haug 1975 ) .",
    "equivalently , the inclusion of electron - electron bremsstrahlung requires , for a given photon yield , a softer ( steeper ) electron spectrum than would be required assuming electron - ion bremsstrahlung alone .",
    "the _ ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ) has opened a new era in the study of hard x - ray spectra from solar flares . with the high - resolution",
    "hard x - ray spectra made available by _ rhessi _ , an investigation into the form of the hard x - ray spectrum above @xmath0  kev with the full ( electron - ion + electron - electron ) cross - section is now warranted .    in this paper",
    "we therefore study the effect of adding the electron - electron bremsstrahlung term on the mean electron spectrum corresponding to a given hard x - ray spectrum . in ",
    "2 we discuss the forms of the electron - ion and electron - electron cross - sections , and we show that the presence of an upper limit to the photon energy in the electron - electron process can in principle provide evidence for a high - energy cutoff in the electron spectrum and/or evidence of strong anisotropy in the injected electron distribution . in ",
    "3 we discuss the sample event ( on january 17 , 2005 ) chosen for analysis . in ",
    "4 we present the form of the electron spectrum corresponding to the observed photon spectrum , using both forward - fitting ( e.g , holman et al . 2003 ) and regularization ( piana et al . 2003 ) techniques in conjunction with the full ( electron - ion + electron - electron ) bremsstrahlung cross - section . in  5 we discuss the results obtained , and in particular we point out that certain features in the electron spectrum inferred using the electron - ion bremsstrahlung cross - section are artifacts that can vanish when the full , correct , cross - section is employed .",
    "the cross - section ( e.g. , koch & motz 1959 ) for electron - ion bremsstrahlung scales as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the atomic number of the ion .",
    "further , in consideration of electron - electron bremsstrahlung , the possible binding of target electrons to their host ions in a neutral or partially - ionized medium is not significant ( e. haug , personal communication ) .",
    "hence , in a quasi - neutral target of particles with atomic number @xmath18 , the bremsstrahlung cross - section per atom for emission of a photon of energy @xmath19 by an electron of energy @xmath20 is in general equal to    @xmath21    were @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the cross - sections for bremsstrahlung in electron - proton , and electron - electron collisions , respectively .",
    "the form of @xmath24 , averaged over solid angle _ in the rest frame of the target electron _ has been given for the case @xmath25 ( page 347 of that paper ) , the term @xmath26 on line 3 of the equation should be replaced by @xmath27 ",
    "e. haug , personal communication . ] by haug ( 1998 ) , while the solid - angle - averaged form in the _ zero - momentum _ ( `` center - of mass '' ) frame has been given by haug ( 1989 ) .",
    "neither of these formulae are strictly appropriate to the case of an electron beam incident on a warm plasma : the target electrons , unlike the ions , have a velocity that may be comparable to the velocity of the electrons in the impinging beam , so that a range of injected particle / target particle relative velocities exist for a given injected electron energy .",
    "however , as verified through numerical simulation , for low electron energies ( from @xmath28 to @xmath29  kev ) , the form of @xmath7 corresponding to a given hard x - ray spectrum , inferred using the cross - section  ( [ qtot ] ) , does not differ , within statistical uncertainties in the photon flux , from the form of @xmath30 obtained using the electron - ion cross - section alone .",
    "hence , only at electron energies @xmath31  kev is the inclusion of the electron - electron bremsstrahlung term necessary , and , for such energies the velocity of the target particles _ is _ relatively insignificant .",
    "the target particle rest frame is , therefore , a better approximation to the observer frame than is the zero - momentum frame .",
    "hence , use of the electron - electron cross - section in the _ target particle _ rest frame is more appropriate .    when the maximum electron energy is much larger than the photon energies under consideration , the photon spectrum resulting from a power - law spectrum of electrons @xmath32 is also close to power - law form @xmath33 ( haug 1989 ) .",
    "however , while for pure electron - ion bremsstrahlung @xmath34 , for pure electron - electron bremsstrahlung a significantly shallower photon spectrum , with @xmath35 , results .",
    "thus , the importance of the electron - electron bremsstrahlung contribution increases with photon energy and the enhanced emission per electron leads to a flattening of the photon spectrum @xmath4 produced by a given @xmath7 , or , equivalently , a steepening of the @xmath7 form required to produce a given @xmath4 .",
    "it is also important to note that while the electron - ion cross - section is finite for all @xmath36 , the `` laboratory frame '' cross - section for electron - electron bremsstrahlung vanishes above a maximum photon energy , due to the necessarily finite energy carried by the recoiling target electron .",
    "quantitatively ( haug 1975 ) , @xmath37 where @xmath20 is the electron kinetic energy in the laboratory frame ( in units of the electron rest energy @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 is the angle between the incoming electron and the outgoing photon trajectories . for highly _",
    "non_-relativistic electrons ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 for all values of @xmath39 . only for highly relativistic electrons",
    "( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( a singular case ) does @xmath44 ; for all other situations @xmath45 is less than @xmath20 and approaches @xmath46 as @xmath47 ( figure  [ epsmax ] ) .",
    "this result has important implications for the form of the photon spectrum produced by electron - electron bremsstrahlung .",
    "if the electron spectrum @xmath7 has a maximum energy @xmath48 that is not highly relativistic , then while electron - ion bremsstrahlung will generate photons at all energies up to @xmath48 , electron - electron bremsstrahlung will produce no photons at all in the range @xmath49 .",
    "the entire spectrum above @xmath45 will therefore be produced completely by electron - ion bremsstrahlung ; the flattening of the photon spectrum associated with the electron - electron contribution disappears and the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath50 reverts to the form appropriate to electron - ion bremsstrahlung alone .",
    "note also that the maximum photon energy @xmath51 depends significantly on the viewing angle @xmath39 .",
    "hence , if the injected electron distribution is highly beamed , the strong angular dependence of the maximum photon energy produced permits a determination of the direction of the beam .",
    "for example , for @xmath52  mev and @xmath53 , there should be evidence for such a high - energy cutoff in the photon spectrum around 250  kev ( figure  [ epsmax ] ) .",
    "figure  [ theta ] shows the effect of such a 1  mev upper energy cutoff on the total ( electron - ion + electron - electron ) photon spectrum @xmath4 and on its local spectral index @xmath54 .",
    "there is an abrupt step in @xmath55 at @xmath56  kev ; this step moves towards larger energies as @xmath39 is reduced , so that the inferred value of @xmath57 depends on the value of @xmath39 appropriate .",
    "in selecting suitable events for analysis , we searched for a clear identification of high - energy photons in the flare light curve , and specifically a count rate high enough to provide good count statistics in energy channels above 300  kev .",
    "quasi - logarithmic energy binning was used in order to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio in each energy channel and the time bins were chosen equal to rhessi s rotation period ( as given for the time of the flare ) to ensure that there is no differential modulation of the light curve from varying aspects of the imaging grids .",
    "the data were corrected for the following effects : decimation , detector energy response , detector livetime , attenuator transmission , imaging grid transmission , and pulse pile - up .",
    "these steps were performed using standard software incorporating the most up to date information on the instrumental calibration ( schwartz et al .",
    "the background was then subtracted by using the spex package to interpolate between two background time intervals , one before and one after the flare .",
    "data from detectors 2 or 7 were not used , because their energy resolution is significantly poorer than for the other detectors ( smith et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "figure  [ photon ] shows the photon spectrum for the time interval 09:43:16 ",
    "09:44:24 ut ( the time of approximate peak flux ) for the 2005 january 17 ( goes class x3.8 ) event .",
    "this event , which produced several strong gamma - ray lines , was previously studied by kontar & brown ( 2006 ) , who concluded that the pitch angle distribution for electrons up to @xmath0  kev is close to isotropic .",
    "we focus attention on the highest energy spectrum ( @xmath58  kev ) in this paper .",
    "this event was located at position @xmath59 on the solar disk , corresponding to a heliocentric angle @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the assumption of a downward - directed electron beam leads to angles @xmath39 between the beam direction and the observer in the second quadrant ; this enhances the possibility of observing the spectral features noted in  2 associated with the upper limit to electron - electron bremsstrahlung emission ( see figures  [ epsmax ] and [ theta ] ) .",
    "before attempting to determine the form of the mean source electron spectrum responsible for the observed hard x - ray / gamma - ray continuum , it is first necessary to subtract the emission from strong gamma - ray spectral lines . in the energy range under consideration ,",
    "the two most significant ranges for which this subtraction is necessary are ( 483 - 512 )  kev and ( 829 - 882 )  kev .",
    "the corrected spectrum is presented in figure  [ photon ] .",
    "the first of these corresponds to the electron - positron annihilation line at 511  kev and its associated positronium continuum at lower energies , the second to a variety of strong emission lines from @xmath61al , @xmath62cr and @xmath63fe ( see table  1 in ramaty , kozlovsky , & lingenfelter 1979 ; table  1 in kozlovsky , murphy , & ramaty 2002 ) . these lines were `` removed '' by replacing the data in these ranges with a smooth interpolation of the continuum spectrum on either side of each feature .",
    "the residual photon spectra then represent principally bremsstrahlung continuum , with an emissivity given by equation  ( [ def ] ) .",
    "these continuum spectra were then used to determine the mean electron flux spectrum @xmath7 in the source , using two different , well - established , methodologies for solution of equation  ( [ def ] ) .",
    "here we follow the procedure of holman et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) and assume that the mean electron spectrum is the sum of a low - energy maxwellian , plus a broken power law of the form    @xmath64    because the maxwellian part of @xmath7 ( with a characteristic temperature @xmath65  kev ) is utterly insignificant at energies @xmath66  kev , it is not necessary to consider this component in our analysis .",
    "calculation , using equation  ( [ def ] ) , of the photon spectrum for an @xmath7 of the form  ( [ broken ] ) , and comparison with the observed @xmath4 above @xmath67  kev , permits determination of the best - fit values of the four parameters @xmath68 .",
    "we performed such a forward fit for two forms of the bremsstrahlung cross - section : @xmath69 ( which includes electron - ion bremsstrahlung only ) and @xmath70 ( which includes both electron - ion and electron - electron bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "mean values @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( representative of mean solar abundances ) were assumed .    using the cross - section @xmath73 , representing only electron - ion bremsstrahlung , results in best - fit values @xmath74 , and @xmath75  kev . using the more correct cross - section @xmath76 ( which incorporates both electron - ion and electron - electron terms ) gives @xmath77 , and @xmath78  kev .",
    "the forms of both of these fits are shown in figure  [ ffit ] . while inclusion of the electron - electron bremsstrahlung term results in little change to the form of @xmath7 at low energies , its inclusion does lead to the break energy moving downward from @xmath79  kev to @xmath80  kev , and to the spectral index for the high - energy component steepening from @xmath81 to @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "such a steepening of @xmath30 , and the energy above which it becomes significant , are in accordance with the expectations expressed in  1 and with earlier quantitative estimates based on hardening of hard x - ray spectra ( e.g. , vestrand 1988 ) .",
    "piana et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have demonstrated the construction of smooth , _ regularized _ , forms for the mean electron flux spectrum @xmath7 from high - resolution _ rhessi _ photon spectra @xmath4 .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is not necessary to assume an empirical form for the spectrum . additionally , as shown by brown et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this method is capable of revealing accurately the overall `` shape '' of the electron spectrum and indicating the presence and approximate form of small - scale features of sufficient amplitude , if present .",
    "figure [ reg_sol ] shows the recovered @xmath7 solution for the same photon spectrum used in the forward fit procedure of figure  [ ffit ] .",
    "the results are presented in the form of a _ confidence strip _ , a set of different realizations of @xmath7 , each curve corresponding to a different realization of the noisy data set @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath7 recovered using the full cross - section  ( [ qtot ] ) , including electron - electron bremsstrahlung , is , for @xmath84  kev , steeper ( spectral index greater by @xmath85 ) than the @xmath7 recovered assuming purely electron - ion emission .",
    "this result is consistent not only with the forward - fit results of the previous subsection but also with the physical expectations enunciated in  1 .",
    "moreover , the dashed confidence strip ( corresponding to use of the electron - ion cross - section alone ) has an upward break near @xmath86  kev ( as can be verified visually by looking _ along _  rather than _ at _  the strip ) .",
    "however , the true form of @xmath7 , as exhibited by the solid confidence strip , has a rather featureless power - law form over the energy range from 200 - 1000  kev .",
    "consequently , use of the full cross - section , including the electron - electron term that becomes important at energies @xmath87  kev , removes the need to account for the @xmath88  kev energy that characterizes the ( unphysical ) upward break in @xmath7 that appears when only the partial ( electron - ion ) cross - section is used in the analysis .",
    "as expected , recognition of the growing importance of electron - electron bremsstrahlung at high energies reduces , for a given hard x - ray spectrum , the number of high - energy electrons required to produce it ; this leads to a steepening in the inferred mean source electron spectrum @xmath7 above @xmath89  kev . for the january 17 , 2005 event studied , use of the electron - ion cross - section alone leads ,",
    "whether by forward fitting or regularized inversion , to the inference of an upward break ( @xmath90 ) in @xmath7 at @xmath91  kev ( figure  [ reg_sol ] ) . however , when both electron - ion and electron - electron bremsstrahlung emission are considered , this break disappears , resulting in an @xmath7 that has a straightforward power - law form over the energy range from 100 - 1000  kev .",
    "single - power law suggests electron acceleration without characteristic energy and corresponding characteristic scale .",
    "careful interpretation is therefore necessary when faced with apparent hard x - ray spectral changes in this energy range .",
    "one process that can , for a sufficiently strong magnetic field , operate strongly in the few 100 kev range and so affect this argument is gyrosynchrotron emission . however , the presence of this additional emission mechanism would cause the @xmath30 to bend _ downward _ at higher energies .",
    "the fact that , after inclusion of the electron - electron contribution , @xmath30 has no such bend puts an upper limit on the importance of gyrosynchrotron emission and so an upper limit ( @xmath28  kg ) on the strength of the ambient magnetic field",
    ".    trottet et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) report very significant upward breaks ( @xmath92  kev ) in the hard x - ray spectrum for a series of intervals during an electron - dominated gamma - ray event on 1990 june 11 .",
    "we agree with these authors that the inclusion of electron - electron bremsstrahlung can not account for such breaks . however , vestrand ( 1988 ) reports that `` most flares show a break @xmath93 '' occurring at an energy `` @xmath94  kev '' and a similar statement is made by dennis ( 1985 ) ( however , he also reports a much larger spectral break [ @xmath95 in an event observed on june 4 , 1980 ) .",
    "such modest ( @xmath96 ) upward breaks at a photon energies @xmath97  kev are naturally accounted for by including the contribution from electron - electron bremsstrahlung ; other considerations , such as energy - dependent anisotropy ( li 1995 ) or a separate emission / acceleration process ( e.g. , heristchi 1986 ) are in general not required .",
    "only features common to all ( or at least nearly all ) realizations of @xmath7 can be considered real . using this criterion",
    ", one must concede that the recovered confidence strip ( figure  [ reg_sol ] ) is sufficiently wide that no firm evidence for a sudden change in the local spectral index @xmath55 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ theta ] ) can be claimed .",
    "hence the data do not provide compelling evidence for either strong beaming of the accelerated electrons or an upper - energy cutoff @xmath57 in the accelerated electron energy distribution .",
    "such an assessment is bolstered by kontar & brown s ( 2006 ) finding , using a comparison of the brightness of the primary source with that of the photospherically - backscattered albedo patch ( kontar et  al .",
    "2006 ) , that the electron distribution at energies @xmath98  kev in the 2005 january 17 event was also consistent with isotropy .",
