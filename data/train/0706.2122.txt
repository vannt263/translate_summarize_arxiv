    "soft magnetic materials subject to a slowly changing external magnetic field , respond with a jerky motion of the domain walls , known as barkhausen noise @xcite .",
    "many universal properties of this noise have been identified , and are correctly reproduced by theoretical models , confirming that , in analogy to critical phenomena , the statistical features of the signal only depend on general properties of the physical mechanism that govern the magnetization reversal process , while they are independent from the microscopic details of the particular system @xcite .",
    "the average shape of the pulse , being a non  scalar quantity , has been successfully identified as a powerful tool to characterize the universal properties of crackling systems : pulses of different duration , once properly rescaled , are expected to collapse onto a universal function @xcite . in the case of barkhausen noise , pulses from experimental data",
    "do approximately collapse on the same curve @xcite , however , this curve shows a clear leftward asymmetry , while models that very accurately reproduces most of the other universal quantities predict a symmetric shape @xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymmetry in barkhausen pulses is due to the non  instantaneous response of the eddy current field to the domain wall displacement .",
    "barkhausen noise models usually assume this response to be instantaneous , and thus do not capture this asymmetry .",
    "since eddy currents take a finite time to set up and also they persist for a finite time after the corresponding wall displacement , the pressure on the moving domain wall is not strictly proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the wall , but depends on the history of the motion .",
    "the delay has a characteristic timescale , and therefore its effect is more evident on avalanches of comparable duration , and disappears on very large ones , where the separation of timescales is such that the response of the field can be assumed to be instantaneous , and strict universality is recovered . the first order correction to the instantaneous response approximation",
    "can be accounted for by associating a negative effective mass to the wall in the equation of motion @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report a detailed calculation of the retarding pressure starting from maxwell equations , and obtain the negative effective mass as a first order correction to the quasi  static approximation .",
    "our approach is similar to the one of bishop@xcite .",
    "the resulting non - local damping was previously employed in a domain wall dynamics model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where its effect on the barkhausen pulse shape was studied and compared with experimental data . here",
    ", we analyze the role of sample geometry on the eddy current propagation and provide expression for the damping term and the effective mass as a function of the sample aspect ratio .",

    "let us replace the expression [ f ] in the convolution [ pt ] and exchange the sum with the integral : @xmath63 where the heaviside function was eliminated by restricting the domain of integration . for small relaxation times",
    "( note that @xmath64 for every @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) the exponential functions in the integral decay very fast around @xmath67 , so that the velocities that sensibly contribute to the convolutions are only those at time very close to @xmath44 .",
    "we may thus expand @xmath68 around @xmath69 , and perform the integrals .",

    "i. the dependence on @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) correctly disappears in the limit @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the physical quantities @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath77 all increase with the overall sample size .",
    "for example , for a sample of a given thickness @xmath86 , both damping coefficient and effective mass increase with @xmath87 and @xmath105 respectively .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath87 becomes larger than @xmath86 , they saturate to a value proportional to @xmath86 and @xmath106 respectively .",
    "since the mass increases faster than the damping with @xmath87 , the characteristic time also increases with @xmath87 , and saturates to a value proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "a similar behavior is observed by varying @xmath86 at fixed @xmath87 , although the role of the two dimensions transverse and parallel to the wall is not symmetric .",
    "essentially the dependence of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath77 on the geometry of the sample is dominated by the smaller between @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus the relevance of the eddy current dynamic effect , is controlled by the smaller sample dimension : the thinner the sample , the smaller the effect , while the rest of the geometry does not play any relevant role . the characteristic time in @xmath108 units is approximately equal to @xmath109 , when @xmath110 , @xmath111 when @xmath112 , and has its minimum @xmath113 for a square rod . in all cases , it stays between @xmath114 and @xmath115 of the squared relevant sample size .",

    "the straight lines are fits with the asymptotic behaviors calculated for the large @xmath86 and @xmath87 limits .",
    "the asymmetry in barkhausen pulses is due to the non  instantaneous response of the field to the domain wall displacement .",
    "most treatments of barkhausen noise assume the eddy current drag on the magnetic domain wall to be instantaneous , which corresponds to assuming @xmath10 within the magnetic domains . however , eddy currents take a finite time to set up after the magnetic reversal , and persist for a finite time after the corresponding wall displacement .",
    "this time delay causes the eddy pressure on the wall at a given time @xmath44 not to be strictly proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the wall , but to depend on a weighted average of velocities of the wall up to time @xmath44 .",
    "this quasi ",
    "inertial effect is responsible for the asymmetry in the pulse shape observed in barkhausen experiments .",
    "the delay has a characteristic timescale @xmath77 , and therefore its effect is more severe on avalanches of comparable duration . for very long avalanches",
    "the separation of timescales is such that the response of the field can be assumed to be instantaneous , therefore the asymmetry disappears , and strict universality is recovered .",
    "starting from the full maxwell equation , that includes the dynamic eddy current effects , we calculate the retarded pressure on the wall .",
    "the first order correction to the quasi ",
    "static ( @xmath10 ) solution , leads to identify a damping coefficient , which survives to the @xmath119 limit and coincides with the one calculated assuming an instantaneous response , and an effective mass , that vanishes in the @xmath120 limit .",
    "a damping coefficient and an effective mass can be formally defined beyond the first order approximation , however , they both results to be frequency dependent .",
    "damping coefficient , effective mass , and characteristic time depend on the sample geometry , however , it turns out that the only geometrical parameter that significantly affects them is the smaller sample dimension .",
    "the effective mass results to be negative at all frequencies . this may be understood by observing that the retarded pressure at time @xmath44 is proportional to an average of previous velocities of the wall up to time @xmath44 .",
    "when the wall is accelerating , the effective average velocity is smaller than the instantaneous one , and the opposite is true when the wall decelerates .",
    "the leftward pulse asymmetry observed in barkhausen experiments is indeed consistent with a negative effective mass : the avalanche start fast , and end slowly , which is exactly the opposite of what one would expect from standard inertia .",
