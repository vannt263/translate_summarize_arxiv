    "sectintro    string inspired cosmology is currently attracting a great deal of attention .",
    "the most favored starting point in any analysis is the low energy string effective action from which the lowest order string beta - function equations can be derived @xcite .",
    "these equations , for the closed string , consist of three long range fields , the dilaton @xmath1 , the kalb - ramond field strength @xmath2 , and the graviton , all arising out of the massless excitation of the string .",
    "in addition there is a constant related to the central charge of the string theory which vanishes in the critical number of dimensions 10 or 26 .",
    "the fact that only the massless excited state is used suggests that the effective action is not a valid description for probing the highest energies associated with string theory .",
    "however , we may hope that through the beta - function equations we are investigating physics associated with events from say the string scale down to the gut scale .",
    "such an approach has already been adopted by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "veneziano and his collaborators have emphasized the possible importance of the duality symmetry which characterizes the equations of string cosmology @xcite .",
    "they point out the possibility that inflation can occur without relying on a potential energy density .",
    "rather , the duality transforms , which relate the dilaton and the metric , lead to a possible inflationary mechanism . in @xcite it is claimed that the inclusion of the @xmath0-field does not seem to change the underlying properties of these duality - related cosmologies , although they also point out possible problems with exiting inflation in these models .",
    "cosmological solutions with a dilaton and a non - trivial @xmath0-field have been obtained by tseytlin@xcite , for curved maximally symmetric spaces in string theory , with a non - zero central charge deficit .",
    "( see @xcite for details and complete references ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the outcome of string - dominated cosmology in a four dimensional friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime including a homogeneous @xmath0-field ( @xmath2 ) as well as a non - zero critical charge deficit @xmath3 ( some of the particular solutions were previously obtained by tseytlin @xcite ) .",
    "their results are based on a phase - plane analysis . in this paper",
    ", we present the general analytic solutions , including both long and short wavelength solutions for the @xmath0-field , but setting @xmath4 , and then show how this can be extended to simple anisotropic models in higher dimensions .    in section 2 we introduce the low energy equations of motion in the string frame and demonstrate how they can be related via simple conformal transforms to equations in other frames .",
    "section 3 concentrates on four dimensional frw models and describes the complete solution for a homogeneous @xmath0-field , reproducing where applicable previous solutions found in the literature @xcite .",
    "we go on to describe radiation solutions in which the @xmath0-field has a spatial dependence on small scales ( i.e.  wavelengths much smaller than the hubble length ) . because the metric ( and the dilaton ) is homogeneous and isotropic we require the @xmath0-field energy - momentum tensor to be homogeneous and isotropic on average , and demonstrate how at late times we recover the general relativistic results for radiation and curvature dominated models . in section 4 we consider the influence of homogeneous and radiation solutions of the @xmath0-field in @xmath5 cosmologies where the metric tensor is decomposed into the direct product of a four dimensional frw metric and an @xmath6 dimensional metric .",
    "we give general analytic solutions for the simplest version of the @xmath7 dimensional bianchi i models where there are just two scale factors .",
    "the results indicate how the @xmath0-field can produce an anisotropic expansion leading to one scale expanding whilst the other contracts . finally in section 5",
    "we summarize our main results .",
    "sectaction    we shall take as our starting point the low energy @xmath7-dimensional string effective action @xcite s = d^dx e^- + d^dx _ matter , sact where @xmath8 and we adopt the sign conventions denoted ( + + + ) by misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite .",

    "the effect of certain types of `` stringy matter '' has been considered elsewhere in the literature @xcite .",
    "specific schemes of compactification , not to mention the chosen gauge symmetries of the theory , will determine the behavior ( and number ) of both bosonic and fermionic matter fields .",
    "it is not inconceivable that in some ` matter - dominated era ' of the stringy epoch of the universe these matter fields will play a part in determining the cosmological evolution .",
    "in particular , the antisymmetric tensor may be considered a matter field , and as we shall see it plays a significant role in string cosmology . in favor of considering the possible effects of this field on the cosmology we shall ignore all other contributions from the matter lagrangian .",
    "the charge deficit @xmath3 is a constant proportional to @xmath14 for the bosonic string and @xmath15 in the heterotic or superstring .",
    "we will set @xmath4 in our analysis .",
    "this may well be necessary for a consistent theory either by choosing the appropriate number of spatial dimensions or due to cancellation with contributions from other matter fields . even for non - zero @xmath3",
    "this should be an increasingly good approximation at early times if the curvature and/or kinetic energy densities are large , @xmath16 , but we would need to consider its effect at late times in an expanding universe .",
    "ssectconf    these field equations are similar to those found in brans - dicke gravity@xcite with the brans - dicke parameter @xmath17 .",
    "this is only strictly true in the absence of the @xmath0-field as in brans - dicke gravity it is assumed that the energy - momentum tensor of all fields ( other than the brans - dicke field , @xmath18 ) are minimally coupled to the metric @xmath11 . while the energy - momentum tensor of other matter fields are assumed to be conserved with respect to this metric ( the string metric ) , so that @xmath19 , we can not define an energy - momentum tensor solely in terms of the @xmath0-field and the string metric which is conserved independently of the dilaton .",

    "we have also given analytic solutions in the case where this radiation is isotropic on three spatial dimensions .",
    "the dynamical effect of the @xmath0-field is then negligible near the curvature singularity and we see both the accelerated and decelerated branches seen in vacuum .",

    "this is hardly surprising if one considers the evolution of the metric in the einstein frame , of which we have made extensive use throughout , where these string models correspond simply to a universe with a massless scalar field ( plus radiation for the short wavelength @xmath0-field ) and so there can be no inflation in this frame .",
    "it is important to emphasize the limited cosmological era in which the results presented here may be valid .",
    "while the appearance of a minimum value for the scale factor of three dimensional space is intriguing , the string metric is still in general singular at @xmath47 . by solving the field equations only to lowest order in the string coupling constant @xmath232 we are neglecting terms of order @xmath233 with respect to terms such as @xmath234 , @xmath130 , @xmath235 , etc .  in the field equations .",
    "as all our solutions approach power - law evolution ( @xmath236 ) as @xmath60 , then these terms inevitably become divergent , so our solutions will only be good approximations to the true evolution when the spacetime curvature is sufficiently small . on the other hand we have neglected any potential for the dilaton , assuming @xmath237 .",
    "if we hope to recover the standard hot big bang cosmology at late times then we will have to include matter fields which presumably provide a potential to fix the present day value of the dilaton ( and thus satisfy observational limits on the allowed variation of the gravitational coupling strength within the solar system today ) . indeed",
    "if this potential for the dilaton or for any other fields produces an inflationary era any memory of a preceding stringy era would be all but erased .",
    "neglecting the dilaton potential is only likely to be valid while kinetic terms dominate .",
