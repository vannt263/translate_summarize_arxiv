    "the surprising existence of short period ( @xmath14 days ) jupiter mass extra - solar planets ( termed `` hot jupiters '' ) confirmed by radial velocity ( rv ) measurements in the last 8 years has shown that our own solar system is certainly not typical .",
    "the class of hot jupiter planets ( @xmath2 days and @xmath3 ) makes up @xmath115% ( 17 out of 117 as of 01/10/03 ) of the planets discovered by the rv technique to date ( schneider 1996 ) and @xmath11% of nearby solar type stars host such a companion ( butler et al .",
    "to date there are only two confirmed transiting extra - solar planets , hd 209458b ( charbonneau et al . 2000 ; brown et al . 2001 ) discovered first by the rv method , and ogle - tr-56 discovered first by the transit method ( udalski et al .",
    "2002 ; konacki et al .",
    "2003 ) . using geometric considerations and the planet / star properties of hd 209458b as a typical hot jupiter system",
    ", we get the probability of a full transit given that a solar type star has a hot jupiter as @xmath111% .",
    "this fits in nicely with the discovery of 17 hot jupiters to date via rv but only one transiting hot jupiter in this sample .",
    "more logically one should observe large numbers of stars in parallel to obtain transit candidates and then use rv to follow up .",
    "recently we are starting to see the fruits of current transit surveys .",
    "ogle have produced of the order of 100 transit candidates over two seasons ( udalski et al .",
    "2002a , b ; udalski et al . 2003 ) and explore have produced a possible 4 transiting planets ( yee et al .",
    "2003 ) , all of which have yet to be confirmed by detailed spectroscopic follow up .",
    "the study of open clusters for transiting planets has a number of advantages over fields in other parts of the sky or galactic plane .",
    "while providing a relatively large concentration of stars on the sky ( but not so large as to cause blending problems as in the case of globular clusters observed from the ground ) , they also provide a set of common stellar parameters for the cluster members .",
    "these are metallicity , age , stellar crowding and radiation density .",
    "all cluster members lie at roughly the same distance aswell allowing magnitude and colour to be directly related to star radius / mass for main sequence cluster members .",
    "a trend that host stars tend to be metal rich ( santos et al . 2003 ) is one of the results that will be confirmed or refuted from the determination of the fraction of stars hosting a hot jupiter ( from now on referred to as the hot jupiter fraction ) in open clusters .",
    ".properties of the open cluster ngc  7789 .",
    "data taken from http://obswww.unige.ch/webda by mermilliod , j.c . and the simbad database . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we observed the open cluster ngc  7789 ( see table 1 ) using the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) on la palma in the canary islands during the 11 nights from 10th to 20th august 2000 .",
    "we used the wide field camera ( wfc ) which consists of a 4 eev ccd mosaic where each ccd is 2048x4096 pixels .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.33/pix and field of view @xmath10.5x 0.5 .",
    "the gain and readout noise values for each chip were calculated automatically during the preprocessing stage of the data reduction ( section 3 ) .",
    "the mosaic field was centred on ngc  7789 at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the procedure for each night was to obtain @xmath15 bias frames and @xmath18 sky flat frames at both the beginning and end of the night .",
    "observations on ngc  7789 consisted of ten 300s exposures followed by a single bias frame repeated throughout the whole night . with a readout time of 100s and various losses due to bad",
    "weather / seeing and telescope jumps , this resulted in a total of 684x300s exposures in sloan @xmath6 .",
    "we also took 5 images of ngc  7789 with varying exposure times in harris @xmath7 , along with 5 sky flat frames , in order to provide us with the necessary colour information .",
    "each chip was treated independently for the purpose of the reductions : bias pattern removal , overscan correction , flat fielding etc .",
    "the reduction process was carried out by a single c - shell / iraf script that runs according to a user defined parameter file .",
    "bad pixels were flagged in a user defined detector bad pixel mask , and ignored where relevant .",
    "the photometry on the reduced science frames in the sloan @xmath6 filter was done using the method of difference image analysis ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) . our implementation of this procedure was adapted from the code written for the moa project ( bond et al .",
    "2001 ) , and it consists of three automated scripts .",
    "bad pixels are propagated through the scripts in the correct fashion .",
    "the first script was used to construct a mean reference frame from a set of 13 consecutive best seeing ( @xmath1 1 ) frames , and produce an associated star list with magnitudes measured by daophot psf fitting .",
    "the second script produced the difference images ( see bond et al .",
    "2001 ) and the third script measured the differential flux on each difference image via optimal psf scaling at the position of each star .",
    "a lightcurve for each star was constructed by the addition of the differential fluxes to the star magnitude as measured on the reference frame .",
    "flux measurements were rejected for a @xmath8 for the psf scaling , and for psfs with a fwhm@xmath97.0 pix , in order to remove bad measurements .",
    "hence all the stars have varying numbers of epochs measured .",
    "lightcurves with less than 300 epochs ( out of a possible 684 ) were rejected .",
    "this analysis produced 8631 lightcurves on chip 1 , 7625 lightcurves on chip 2 , 8411 lightcurves on chip 3 and 8830 lightcurves on chip 4 ( centred on the cluster ) .",
    "figure 1 shows a diagram of the scatter in the lightcurves against magnitude for chip 2 .",
    "the astrometry was done by matching 358 stars from the four reference frames ( one for each chip ) with the usno - b1.0 star catalogue using a field overlay in the image display tool gaia .",
    "the wfc suffers from pincushion distortion , hence it was necessary to fit a 9 parameter astrometric solution to the reference frames in order to obtain sufficiently accurate equatorial coordinates for all the stars .",
    "the 9 parameters are made up of 6 parameters to define the linear transformation between pixel coordinates and equatorial coordinates , 2 parameters to define the plate centre and 1 parameter to define the radial distortion coefficient .",
    "the starlink package astrom was used to do the fit and the achieved accuracy was @xmath10.4 arcsec rms radially for the 358 matching stars .",
    "the two best images in the harris @xmath7 filter were aligned with the sloan @xmath6 reference frame for each chip and the magnitudes of the stars were measured using daophot psf fitting .",
    "magnitude measurements were averaged and any stars without two measurements were treated as having an unknown harris @xmath7 magnitude .",
    "this was done so that airmass differences between the two harris @xmath7 images did not have to be taken into account . in order to calibrate the instrumental harris @xmath7 and sloan @xmath6 magnitudes , johnson @xmath10 data kindly supplied by b. mochejska was used . for a full description of this data set ,",
    "see mochejska & kaluzny ( 1999 ) .",
    "stars were identified as matches between the johnson @xmath10 data set and the harris - sloan @xmath11 data set if they were within 0.5of each other ( using the equatorial coordinates from each data set ) and if there were no other stars from the harris - sloan @xmath11 data set within 4.0 .",
    "this resulted in 286 matches for chip 1 , 100 matches for chip 2 , 62 matches for chip 3 and 812 matches for chip 4 .",
    "a linear transformation of the form : @xmath12 was solved for by minimising the chi squared of the fit for the matching stars on each chip .",
    "the symbols @xmath13 and @xmath7 represent the johnson @xmath10 magnitudes , and the symbols @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the sloan @xmath6 and harris @xmath7 instrumental magnitudes respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows an instrumental colour magnitude diagram for chip 4 , the chip containing the cluster , where the cluster main sequence can be clearly seen . around 76% stars in our data set",
    "have calibrated colour measurements .",
    "a modified matched filter algorithm was used in order to detect the transit candidates . for each lightcurve ,",
    "a set of 12 transit durations in a geometric sequence starting at 0.5 hours with a geometric factor of @xmath11.23 , and ending at 5.0 hours , was generated .",
    "for each transit duration @xmath16 , the lightcurve was stepped through from the start of the lightcurve @xmath17 to the end of the lightcurve @xmath18 in time steps of @xmath19 . at each time @xmath20",
    ", a box car transit curve of total length @xmath21 , transit duration @xmath16 and time of central transit @xmath20 was fitted via least squares , and a constant magnitude of total length @xmath21 and central time @xmath20 was also fitted via least squares .",
    "the fits were only carried out if there were at least 3 data points during the `` in transit '' and at least 8 data points during the `` out of transit '' .",
    "for each lightcurve , @xmath16 and @xmath20 a transit statistic was calculated as defined by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the chi squared of the box car transit fit , @xmath24 is the chi squared of the constant fit , @xmath25 is the chi squared of the `` out of transit '' for the boxcar transit fit and @xmath26 is the number of data points `` out of transit '' .",
    "the statistic @xmath27 is effectively the s / n squared of the fitted transit signal renormalised to the reduced chi squared of the `` out of transit '' .",
    "this modified matched filter algorithm was designed to help downweight systematic errors with @xmath28 ( and serendipitously , variables ) since transit signals should have @xmath29 .",
    "an example boxcar transit fit highlighting a transit candidate is shown in figure 3 .",
    "using the transit detection algorithm , it would be useful to know how many hot jupiter planets to expect to detect given the data . to do this",
    "a monte carlo simulation was carried out . for each lightcurve / star with a colour ,",
    "a set of 1000 hot jupiters was generated with radii of 1.40@xmath30 , @xmath31 uniformly distributed between @xmath32 days@xmath33 and @xmath34 days@xmath33 , @xmath35 uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 , and @xmath20 uniformly distributed between @xmath17 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent orbital period and orbital inclination respectively ) . the lower limit on @xmath31 is taken from the fact that all rv exoplanets have @xmath39 days , and the upper limit on the period is arbitrary .",
    "the transit lightcurve for each hot jupiter was added to the current lightcurve in turn and the transit statistic calculated at each transit .",
    "the fraction of hot jupiters detected ( hot jupiter detection probability ) was calculated as a function of the transit statistic threshold and the number of transits detected . in order to calculate the false alarm probability also as a function of the transit statistic threshold and the number of transits detected , the transit statistic was calculated at each transit without adding in the transit lightcurve , but using the current transit duration .",
    "figure 4 shows a plot of the number of expected planets and false alarms for all stars with colours in the data .",
    "a transit statisitic threshold of 100 ( s / n@xmath110 ) for one detected transit signature seems a good choice in order to limit the number of expected false alarms but maintain a relatively high number of expected detections .",
    "such a choice yields 1.93 expected false alarms and 100.7 expected hot jupiter detections . assuming that @xmath11% of stars host a hot jupiter",
    ", then we expect @xmath11 transiting planet .",
    "we can not limit our transit candidates to those that show two transit signatures since this would mean that we expect to detect no planets due to the poor period coverage of the data set .",
    "in the search for our transit candidates we have developed an accurate , efficient and fast photometry pipeline that uses the raw data from the telescope to deliver lightcurves .",
    "this is important considering the high quantity of data that may arise from a transit survey .",
    "the pipeline has also been applied successfully to other data sets including the planet 2002 transit data .",
    "we hope to assign a cluster membership probability to each star using the colour , magnitude and position data to construct a 3d probability density function via maximum likelihood fitting .",
    "this will allow us to split the star sample in a statistical sense into cluster and field stars .",
    "having applied the transit detection algorithm to our data set we have a number of transit candidates ( see figure 3 ) and variable stars ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "we may supply an estimate of the planet radius for each candidate since we have star colours ( assuming the stars to be main sequence ) , but we will need more data in order to confirm the planetary status .",
    "for the transit candidate shown in figure 3 , we derive a minimum planetary radius of @xmath40 by fitting a centrally transiting hot jupiter orbiting a linear limb darkened star ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "confirmation in the magnitude range of our star sample will take the form of ruling out possible transit mimics , like grazing stellar binaries etc . to do this",
    "we will need two colour time series observations .",
    "radial velocities may constrain the mass of the planet for the brighter candidates .    when the status of our transit candidates is confirmed",
    "we may use the detection probabilities and the cluster membership probabilities to estimate the hot jupiter fraction for the cluster and the field stars .",
    "this may then be compared to the current estimates of the hot jupiter fraction for main sequence stars ."
