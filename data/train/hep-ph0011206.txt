    "run  i physics analyses ( i.e. , @xcite ) at the tevatron have employed constant @xmath1-factors to approximate corrections . with the increased energy and luminosity of run  ii and the new energy regime that will be probed with the cern lhc , simulations incorporating higher order corrections will be of increased importance .",
    "differential cross - section predictions for di - boson production at hadron colliders are normally accomplished with monte carlo integration programs .",
    "divergences inherent in the feynman graphs contributing at ( ) are handled with either the phase space slicing method  @xcite or the subtraction method  @xcite with the effect that both positive weighted events and negative weighted ( or probability ) events are generated .",
    "the contribution from negative weighted events cancels in an integration over a suitably large volume of hadronic final states , and a physical ( positive probability ) prediction is obtained .",
    "integration programs are successful in producing distribution and cross - section predictions for inclusive observables subject to any experimental cuts providing statistics are large enough to effect the cancellations , and a sufficient volume of jets has been integrated within each histogram bin .",
    "however , owing to the negative probability events , unweighted event generation  the generation of events with the distribution predicted by theory  with these  matrix elements has not been achieved to date .",
    "unweighted event generation is often preferred over integrated distributions because it can genuinely simulate experimental data and because it is difficult to perform detector simulation on the large event statistics required for integrated distributions .",
    "unweighted event generation can be reduced to a problem of rendering all event weights positive definite .",
    "if a sample of positive definite weighted events can be obtained , the monte carlo hit - and - miss method is commonly used for unweighting .",
    "the maximum event weight @xmath2 for the process is estimated , for instance , by sampling the cross - section a number of times .",
    "the ratio of event weight over the maximum event weight @xmath3 is compared to a random number @xmath4 generated uniformly in the interval ( 0,1 ) .",
    "events for which the ratio exceeds the random number ( @xmath5 ) are accepted , the others are rejected .",
    "this ensures the accepted events are distributed according to the description provided by the matrix element , and so all have unit weight .",
    "in this paper we describe an algorithm which extends the usefulness of the present  hadronic di - boson production programs by providing a means for unweighted event generation thereby presenting the  predictions in a format better suited for experimental simulations .",
    "it deals specifically with the region of low transverse momentum of the @xmath6 system , where higher order corrections are largest . as for the drell - yan process , resummation",
    "( first proposed by @xcite ) is expected to give more reliable predictions in this region  however a resummed treatment of the @xmath7 process does not exist and a comparison with fixed order predictions will always be of interest .",
    "another approach for this problematic region is the matching of the zero - order matrix elements using a parton shower model for simulations of the initial - state shower to the first order tree level ( i.e. , ( ) ) matrix elements .",
    "this has been accomplished for the single vector boson case  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm makes use of the matrix elements from the baur , han , and ohnemus ( bho )  @xcite integration package which employs the phase space slicing method as regularization scheme .",
    "this scheme makes use of approximations for the analytic integration of a volume of soft and collinear real emissions .",

    "a cylinder of jets defined by a transverse momentum cutoff @xmath8 is used to partition event generation into a subprocess where the real emission has sufficient transverse momentum to be potentially observable ( called 1  jet ) and another subprocess ( called 0  jet ) where the real emission ( if present ) has sufficiently small transverse momentum such that it is taken as unobservable",
    ". there are no divergences in the 1  jet  cross - section so these events all have positive weights and unweighted event generation may be accomplished by applying monte carlo hit - and - miss .",
    "difficulties arise in the treatment of the 0  jet  events , which is the topic of this paper .",
    "the missing transverse momentum in 0  jet  events may arise from the invisible neutrino and from jets which escape detection . by fixing the total missing transverse momentum rather than the individual contributions from the invisible neutrino and unobserved jets ,",
    "an integration volume of real emissions phase space can be generated and so the cancellations between the real emissions and one - loop graphs can be accomplished by a monte carlo integration over this jet volume .",
    "the charged lepton and missing transverse momentum vectors ( i.e. , the observable quantities ) are kept fixed in the laboratory frame throughout the integration .",
    "since the jet volume may be large , the fixing of the observable quantities is essential .",
    "an integration which instead keeps other quantities such as the subprocess energy and boost fixed ( as would be the case if the phase space slicing method were applicable to such large jet volumes ) would also necessarily be an integration over observationally different charged lepton vectors .",
    "a final state neutrino is not the only means of generating the missing transverse momentum over which a jet volume can be integrated .",
    "anything which contributes to the missing transverse momentum may be used including the primordial @xmath9 distribution of the proton , multiple interactions , minimum bias events , and even detector resolution . for @xmath6 production with leptonic decays ,",

    "a hypothetical jet transverse momentum distribution is shown for the n  body  and n+1  body  case .",
    "the n+1  body  contribution diverges as the jets become soft or collinear , while the n  body  contribution is a negative divergence at the origin .",
    "the divergences cancel in an integration over a suitably large volume of jet transverse momenta ( hatched region ) .",
    "the phase space slicing method effects such an integration , but the jet volume is not sufficiently large to keep the cross - section in the inclusive ( hatched ) region positive for most events .",
    "we begin by dividing events into two classes : those containing a jet with sufficient transverse momentum ( @xmath25 ) to be classified as potentially observable ( referred to here as 1  jet ) ; and those without a jet or containing a jet with transverse momentum below the cutoff @xmath26 ( referred to as 0  jet ) .",
    "this differs from the definition of n  body  and n+1  body  events where the soft and collinear cutoffs define the partition .",
    "in the 1  jet  region , the matrix elements are order , but the calculation is leading order .",
    "there are no divergences nor are there negative weighted events , so event generation can be accomplished with the usual monte carlo techniques .",
    "the algorithm concerns events in the 0  jet  region only and we focus exclusively on events of this type for the remainder of this paper .",
    "the phase space slicing method is extended by integrating out the cylinder of jets defined by the @xmath8 using a second stage monte carlo integration . as the @xmath8 is chosen to be the order of 10  gev",
    ", there is a danger that the integration may affect the kinematics of the event to the point which is observable by the detector . with this in mind , the observable vectors ( charged leptons for the case of @xmath6 production with leptonic decays ) are kept fixed throughout the integration , and the center of mass frame vectors are allowed to fluctuate .",
    "we start by sampling the observable quantities of the event i.e. , fixing the vectors @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the momentum of the charged lepton from the @xmath29 decay , @xmath30 are the momenta of the charged leptons from the @xmath31 decay , and @xmath32 is the missing transverse momentum . with the @xmath31 boson taken on shell and requiring no net momentum transverse to the beam ,",
    "this amounts to 8 degrees of freedom .    for the case of the n  body  matrix element these vectors also fix the neutrino four - vector with @xmath33 and the @xmath34-mass constraint gives zero or two solutions for the neutrino longitudinal momentum . within the bho  matrix elements a further 4  degrees of freedom",
    "specify the  corrections .",
    "thus the average n  body  weight @xmath35 for the observable event is arrived at by integrating over these degrees of freedom and averaging over the two neutrino solutions .",
    "this weight is usually negative .",
    "when no neutrino solutions exist the weight is zero .",
    "we refer to a point in the full n  body  phase space ( defined by the vectors of eq .",
    "[ fixedvectors ] , the 4 extra degrees of freedom , and the neutrino solution choice ) as a `` subevent '' , such that an `` event '' as defined by this algorithm is an integration over many subevents .",
    "we now incorporate the cylinder of jets defined by the @xmath8 by performing a similar integration over n+1  body  subevents .",
    "for each subevent a jet with transverse momentum up to the cutoff is sampled ( 3 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the jet transverse momentum fixes the invisible neutrino transverse momentum for the event with the constraint that the observed missing transverse momentum is kept fixed , @xmath36 the longitudinal neutrino momentum is specified up to a two - fold ambiguity by the @xmath34-mass constraint .",
    "the charged lepton vectors are also kept fixed in the laboratory frame , such that all the quantities in eq .",
    "[ fixedvectors ] are unchanged throughout the integration .",
    "the average subevent weight is @xmath37 , which is a positive number .    the phase space for a monte carlo integration is normally sampled in terms of variables such as the invariant masses , rapidities , and decay angles which give a triangular transformation matrix such that the jacobian is the product of the diagonal entries ( as is the case for the di - boson integration packages ) .",
    "the fixed charged lepton vectors in the laboratory frame constraint introduces inherent correlations , and the transformation matrix becomes more complicated : for the @xmath6 1  jet  case it is a @xmath38 matrix with no zero elements .",
    "fortunately it is simple to calculate this matrix and its jacobian numerically on an event by event basis , which is the strategy we have used .",
    "this jacobian is included in the subevent weights @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the total event weight for the configuration defined by eq .  [ fixedvectors ] is the sum of the n  body  and n+1  bodycontributions , with a factor which accounts for the observable vectors phase space sampling @xmath41    it is unimportant that the number of subevents for the second stage integration be sufficiently large to give an accurate result for each observable event .",
    "a poor accuracy simply means two identically configured events may have differing event weights , however by grace of the monte carlo method , the average converges to give the correct cross - section .",
    "the subevent statistics are required to be sufficiently large to ensure the event weights of eq .",
    "[ eventweight ] very rarely fall negative on account of statistical fluctuations .",
    "we refer to events where this occurs as `` remnant negative weight events '' .",
    "events of this type are discarded , and thus contribute to a ( biased ) systematic monte carlo error .",
    "the number of subevents is a means of directly controlling this error .",
    "it is easy to evaluate this error .",
    "finally , we note the application of this algorithm to the re - weighting of leading order events ( i.e. , re - scaling of tree level event weights to account for  corrections ) needs to be approached with caution , as the phase space volume of observable vectors in eq .",
    "[ fixedvectors ] is larger for the n+1  body  case than for the n  body  case since only limited configurations of these vectors provide n  body  neutrino longitudinal momentum solutions which satisfy the @xmath34-mass constraint .",

    "the transverse momentum of all charged leptons must exceed 25  gev and the rapidity of all charged leptons must be less than 3 in magnitude . missing transverse momentum must be greater than 25  gev .",
    "the bho  package is employed for the evaluation of matrix elements .",
    "we first evaluate the algorithm s ability to integrate out the negative probability events .",
    "the second stage integration is accomplished with relatively low statistics to keep the computer processing time reasonable , only 100 subevents of each type ( n  bodyand n+1  body ) are used .",
    "for the default choices of the soft and collinear cutoffs in the bhomatrix elements ( @xmath52 ) the cancellations between the n  body  and n+1  body  partitions are very large , and the second stage integration would need unreasonably large statistics for good behavior . in order to achieve a portion of the jet volume integration analytically we increase the cutoffs ( @xmath53 ) which is well within the range of applicability of the soft gluon and leading pole approximations .",
    "we emphasize that experiments must take the integration volume into account by ensuring that their analysis is not sensitive to jets within the volume ( as defined by the jet momentum cutoff of this algorithm _ and _ the soft and collinear cutoffs of the phase space slicing method ) .",
    "this consideration is true in general for the phase space slicing method .    with these choices of the phase space slicing cutoffs `` remnant negative weight events ''",
    "account for approximately 0.1% of the total sample of weighted events and -0.02% of the cross - section .",
    "most of these events are the result of the low second stage integration statistics such that re - evaluating these events with a larger number of subevents renders the event weight positive .",
    "there is another class of remnant negative events which are not due to statistics . for these events",
    "the charged lepton in the @xmath34-decay is emitted along the line of flight of the @xmath34 in its rest frame .",
    "this configuration is disfavored by the spin correlations , wherein the @xmath54-decay ( @xmath55-decay ) with a left - handed ( right - handed ) particle emitted along the @xmath34 line of flight is preferred .",
    "the bho  matrix elements use a spin averaged treatment for the one - loop graphs and so these correlations are not at all included for the virtual corrections ( though spin correlations are included everywhere else ) .",
    "this means events in this configuration receive an unphysically large negative contribution from the one - loop graphs while receiving the correct ( spin correlation suppressed ) contribution from the other graphs .",
    "thus this class of negative event weights arise as a result of the lepton correlation approximations used in the bho  matrix elements .",
    "the algorithm is sensitive to these approximations and would benefit from improved theoretical calculations ( as are included in  @xcite ) .",
    "the negative weights associated to events of this type are extremely small .",
    "finally there are a few events with negative weights at extraordinary subprocess energy ( @xmath56  tev ) where the total cross - section is orders of magnitude below one event per lhc year .",
    "these events may arise from a combination of the lepton correlation effect and an insufficiently large jet volume for events at this energy scale , as suggested by the function given in eq .",

    "the accuracy of the prediction from this algorithm suffers slightly with respect to that from the bho  integration package alone in that the correlations between integration variables make it more difficult for the adaptive integration to optimize the phase space sampling .",
    "it takes considerably more computer time to evaluate the  matrix elements than for the leading - order case .",
    "this algorithm requires a further factor 200 over the  integration package in evaluating one weighted event because of the 2@xmath57100 subevents in the second stage integration .",
    "monte carlo hit - and - miss is used to extract a sample of unweighted events from the ( positive definite ) events generated using this algorithm .",

    "it is impossible to completely eliminate the shaded region of remnant negative events by increasing the second stage integration statistics indefinitely , due to the lepton correlation effects discussed in the first part of this section .",
