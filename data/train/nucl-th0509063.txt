    "one of the well - known important features of realistic nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) potentials is their strong repulsive behavior in the high - momentum regime .",
    "this implies that when performing nuclear structure calculations within a perturbative approach it is unavoidable to renormalize the @xmath5 potential .",
    "the renormalization may be achieved by constructing a potential that takes into account the high momentum components of the original potential in an effective way .",
    "for example , the well - known brueckner reaction matrix @xmath6 @xcite is an energy - dependent effective interaction , defined in a model space @xmath7 , obtained projecting out all two - particle excitations above a chosen fermi surface .",
    "the main drawback of such a procedure is that the @xmath6 matrix is energy dependent , which stems from the fact that it does not fulfill a decoupling condition between the model space @xmath7 and its complement @xmath8 .",
    "recently , we have proposed @xcite a new method to renormalize the bare @xmath5 interaction , which is proving to be an advantageous alternative to the use of the brueckner @xmath6 matrix .",
    "we define a low - momentum @xmath7-space up to a cutoff momentum @xmath4 and derive from the original @xmath9 an effective low - momentum potential @xmath3 that satisfies the decoupling condition between the low- and high - momentum spaces .",
    "this @xmath3 is a smooth potential which preserves exactly the on - shell properties of the original @xmath9 and is suitable for being used directly in nuclear structure calculations .    in applying the low - momentum @xmath5 potential @xmath3 to nuclear structure calculations , an important step is the determination of the decimation momentum @xmath4 for @xmath3 .",
    "there are two considerations : first , @xmath4 is based on the separation of scale idea of the renormalization - group effective field theory ( rgeft ) approach . in low - energy nuclear physics ,",
    "one is interested in phenomena at low - energy scale and consequently the details of the short - distance ( high - energy scale ) physics are unimportant .",
    "this leads to the derivation of the low - momentum potential @xmath3 by integrating out the high - momentum components of modern @xmath5 potentials beyond a cutoff momentum @xmath4 .",
    "the second consideration is that all modern @xmath5 potentials are constructed to fit the empirical phase shifts up to the inelastic threshold @xmath10 mev , which corresponds to a maximum relative momentum @xmath11 .    in the past few years",
    ", we have profitably employed this technique in realistic nuclear structure calculations for both doubly closed - shell nuclei , within the framework of the goldstone expansion @xcite , and open - shell nuclei within the multilevel shell - model framework @xcite . in all these works",
    "we have used for the cutoff momentum the value @xmath12 .",
    "it is interesting , however , to investigate the relation of the cutoff momentum @xmath4 to the dimension of the configuration space in the coordinate representation , where actually our calculations are performed .",
    "the study of such a relation is the aim of the present work , where we show how the choice of a cutoff momentum implies a maximum value for the energy of the two - nucleon system , the latter introducing a simple criterion to choose the two - nucleon model space .    to verify the reliability of this approach we calculate , in the framework of the goldstone expansion , the ground state ( g.s . )",
    "properties of doubly closed - shell nuclei starting from different @xmath5 potentials renormalized through the @xmath3 procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an outline of our calculations .",
    "a detailed discussion of the convergence properties of the perturbative calculations is presented in sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the presentation and discussion of our results for the three nuclei @xmath13he , @xmath1o , and @xmath2ca .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , we renormalize the short - range repulsion of the bare @xmath5 potential @xmath9 by integrating out its high momentum components through the so - called @xmath3 approach .",
    "a detailed description of this procedure can be found in refs .",
    "the renormalized @xmath5 potential @xmath3 preserves the observables predicted by @xmath9 for the two - nucleon system , and consequently its @xmath14 , up to the cutoff momentum @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath3 is a smooth potential and can be used directly in nuclear structure calculations within a perturbative approach .",
    "while the @xmath3 is defined in the momentum space , we perform our calculations for finite nuclei in the coordinate space employing a truncated harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis . since the @xmath3 procedure decouples the momentum space into the low- and high - momentum regime , it is desirable to recover such a decoupling in the ho space",
    ".    let us consider the relative motion of two nucleons in a harmonic oscillator well in the momentum representation . for a given maximum relative momentum @xmath4 ,",
    "the corresponding maximum value of the energy is :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the nucleon mass .",
    "this relation may be re - written in terms of the maximum number @xmath17 of ho quanta for the relative coordinate system , so for a given ho parameter @xmath18 we have :    @xmath19    the above equation provides a simple criterion to map out the two - nucleon ho model space .",
    "if we write the two - nucleon states as the product of ho wave functions    @xmath20    our ho model space is defined as spanned by those two - nucleon states that satisfy the constraint    @xmath21    the need for such a boundary condition for our model space may be also pointed out by the following considerations .",
    "the momentum contents of the two - nucleon wave function clearly depend on the choice of the model space .",
    "for example , the average momentum of ho wave functions is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "suppose we are doing a calculation using a small model space together with a small @xmath18 , so that the momentum contents of the basis wave functions are practically all below 1.5 @xmath23 . in this case , we clearly should use this value for @xmath4 .",
    "let us consider another situation where the model - space wave functions have important momentum components of , say , up to 3.0 @xmath24 . then in this case",
    ", we need to use a larger @xmath4 .",
    "s for @xmath18=27 mev .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "the above considerations may be illustrated by inspecting the explicit expression of the @xmath3 matrix elements in terms of wave functions of the center - of - mass and relative coordinates :      where @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the brody - moshinsky transformation brackets @xcite , and , according to ( 4 ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both @xmath30 . the matrix element @xmath31 s as    @xmath32    because in eq .",
    "( 6 ) the integrals are evaluated up to @xmath4 , it is desirable to throw away those @xmath33 s which extend significantly above the cutoff momentum , and pertain therefore to the high - momentum regime .",
    "we have verified that applying the constraint ( 4 ) amounts to neglect all @xmath33 s which extend their tail more than @xmath34 above @xmath4 .",
    "1 is an explanatory picture where we plot , for a given @xmath3527 mev , three momentum space ho wave functions @xmath33 s with @xmath365 , 7 , and 9 , respectively , as functions of @xmath37 .",
    "the vertical dashed line denotes a value of @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath17=7",
    ".    relation ( 4 ) has a general validity , it should be applied every time the @xmath3 matrix elements are calculated in the ho basis .    in this paper , making use of the present approach , we have studied the ground state properties of doubly closed - shell nuclei within the framework of the goldstone expansion @xcite . more explicitly ,",
    "starting from the purely intrinsic hamiltonian    @xmath39    where @xmath40 stands for the renormalized @xmath9 potential plus the coulomb force , we construct the hartree - fock ( hf ) basis expanding the hf single particle ( sp ) states in terms of ho wave functions .",
    "the hf basis is then employed to sum up the goldstone expansion , including contributions up to fourth - order in the two - body interaction .",
    "our calculations are made in a truncated model space , whose size is related to the values of the cutoff momentum @xmath4 and the @xmath41 parameter .",
    "the calculations are performed increasing the @xmath17 value ( and consequently @xmath4 ) and varying the @xmath18 value until the dependence on @xmath17 ( @xmath4 ) is minimized .",
