    "non - linear iterated maps are now known as an universal tool in numerous scientific domains , including for instance mechanics , hydrodynamics and economy @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "they often appear because the differential equations describing the dynamics of a system can be reduced to non - linear iterations , with the help of poincar recurrence maps for instance .",
    "the resulting iterations combine a great mathematical simplicity , which makes them convenient for numerical simulations , with a large variety of interesting behaviors , providing generic information on the properties of the system .  in particular , they are essential to characterize one of the routes to chaos , the cascade of period doublings @xcite .    in musical acoustics , mc intyre _",
    "et al . _ have given , in a celebrated article @xcite , a general frame for calculating the oscillations of musical instruments , based upon the coupling of a linear resonator and a non - linear excitator ( for reed instruments , the flow generated by a supply pressure in the mouth and modulated by a reed ) .",
    "in an appendix of their article they show that , within simplified models of self - sustained instruments , the equations of evolution can also be reduced to an iterated map with appropriate non - linear functions . for resonators with a simple shape such as a uniform string or a cylindrical tube ,",
    "the basic idea is to choose variables that are amplitudes of the incoming and outgoing waves ( travelling waves ) , instead of usual acoustic pressure and volume velocity in the case of reed instruments .",
    "if the inertia of the reed is ignored ( a good approximation in many cases ) , and if the losses in the resonator are independent of frequency , the model leads to simple iterations ; the normal oscillations correspond to the so called helmholtz motion , a regime in which the various physical quantities vary in time by steps , as in square signals .",
    "square signals obviously are a poor approximation of actual musical signals , but this approach is sufficient when the main purpose is to study regimes of oscillation , not tone - color .    in the case of clarinet - like systems ,",
    "the idea was then expanded @xcite , giving rise to experimental observations of period doubling scenarios and to considerations on the relations between stability of the regimes and the properties of the second iterate of the non - linear function ; see also @xcite and especially @xcite for a review of the properties of iterations in clarinet - like systems and a discussion of the various regimes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "more recent work includes the study of oscillation regimes obtained in experiments @xcite , computer simulation @xcite as well as theory @xcite .",
    "the general form of the iteration function that is relevant for reed musical instruments is presented in section [ iteration ] .",
    "it it is significantly different from the usual iteration parabola ( i.e. the so - called logistic map ) .",
    "moreover , it will be discussed in more detail that the control parameters act in a rather specific way , translating the curve along an axis at @xmath0 rather than acting as an adjustable gain .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to study the iterative properties of functions having this type of behavior , and their effect on the oscillation regimes of reed musical instruments .",
    "we will study the specificities and the role of the higher order iterates of this class of functions , in particular in the regions of the so called `` periodicity windows '' , which take place beyond the threshold of chaos .",
    "these windows are known to contain interesting phenomena @xcite , for instance period tripling or a route to intermittence , which to our knowledge have not yet been studied in the context of reed musical instruments .",
    "moreover , the iterates give a direct representation of the zones of stability of the different regimes ( period doublings for instance ) , directly visible on the slope of the corresponding iterate .    for numerical calculations , it is necessary to select a particular representation of the non - linear function , which in turn requires to choose a mathematical expression of the function giving the volume flow rate as a function of the pressure difference across the reed .",
    "a simple and realistic model of the quasi - static flow rate entering a clarinet mouthpiece was proposed in 1974 by wilson and beavers @xcite , and discussed in more detail in 1990 by hirschberg _",
    "this model provides a good agreement with experiments @xcite and leads to realistic predictions concerning the oscillations of a clarinet @xcite . using this mathematical representation of the flow rate",
    ", we will see that iterations lead to a variety of interesting phenomena .",
    "our purpose here is not to propose the most elaborate possible model of the clarinet , including all physical effects that may occur in real instruments .",
    "it is rather to present general ideas and mathematical solutions as illustration of the various class of phenomena that can take place , within the simplest possible formalism ; in a second step , one can always take this simple model as a starting point , to which perturbative corrections are subsequently added in order to include more specific details .",
    "we first introduce the model in   [ model ] , and then discuss the properties of the iteration function in   [ properties].the bifurcations curves are obtained in   [ bifurcations ] and , in ",
    "[ iterated ] , we discuss the iterated functions and their applications in terms of period tripling and intermittence .",
    "in particular we see how the graph of high order iterates give visible information on the regime of oscillation ( number of period doublings for instance ) or the appearance of a chaotic regime , while nothing special appears directly in the graph of the first iterate .",
    "two appendices are added at the end .",
    "we briefly recall the basic elements of the model , the non - linear characteristics of the excitator , and the origin of the iterations within a simplified treatment of the resonator .      in a quasi static regime",
    ", the flow @xmath1 entering the resonant cavity is modelled with the help of an approximation of the bernoulli equation , as discussed e.g. in @xcite .",

    "<S> , we study in more detail the properties of the corresponding non - linear iterations , with emphasis on the geometrical constructions that can be used to classify the various solutions ( for instance with or without reed beating ) as well as on the periodicity windows that occur within the chaotic region . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we find a regime where period tripling occurs and examine the conditions for intermittency . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , while the direct observation of the iteration function does not reveal much on the oscillation regime of the instrument , the graph of the high order iterates directly gives visible information on the oscillation regime ( characterization of the number of period doubligs , chaotic behaviour , etc . ) .    </S>",
