    "realization of large coherent quantum systems is at the center of attention in quantum experiments with cold atoms @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "besides creating large scale entanglement , it is also important to look for quantum information processing applications of the states created .",
    "recently , a series of experiments has been carried out with cold atomic ensembles using spin squeezing @xcite .",
    "this approach makes it possible to entangle @xmath1 atoms with each other by making them interact with a light field and then measuring the light , realizing in this way a quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement of one of the collective spin components @xcite .",
    "spin squeezed states are useful for continuous variable quantum teleportation @xcite and magnetometry @xcite . in these experiments the atomic ensembles were almost completely polarized , which makes it possible to map the quantum state of these ensembles to the state of bosonic modes @xcite and model with few variables even realistic dynamics including noise @xcite .    a basic scheme for magnetometry with an almost completely polarized spin squeezed state works as follows .",
    "the total spin of the ensemble is rotated by a magnetic field perpendicular to it .",
    "the larger the field , the larger the rotation , which allows one to obtain the field strength by measuring a spin component perpendicular to the mean spin .",
    "so far , it looks as if the mean spin behaves like a clock arm and its position will tell us the value of the magnetic field exactly .",
    "however , at this point one has to remember that we have an ensemble of particles governed by quantum mechanics , and the uncertainty of the spin component perpendicular to the mean spin is never zero .",
    "spin squeezing @xcite can decrease the uncertainty of one of the perpendicular components and this can be used to increase the precision of the magnetometry @xcite .",
    "often the interesting quantity is not the absolute strength of the magnetic field , but its gradient and the effect of the homogeneous field must be suppressed .",
    "for example , the magnetic field of earth must be suppressed when the much smaller magnetic field around an electric device or magnetic structure is measured @xcite .",
    "the field gradient can be determined by differential magnetometry , which can be carried out when two completely polarized atomic ensembles are used .",
    "in fact , the same light beam can pass through the two atomic ensembles , which can be used both for simultaneous spin squeezing of the two atomic ensembles and to carry out the differential measurement @xcite .",
    "in general , singlet states of two large spins also offer the possibility for differential magnetometry @xcite .     particles .",

    "if the uncertainties of the three collective angular momentum components are squeezed one after the other , then a multiparticle singlet state can be obtained @xcite .",
    "( for other approaches creating singlet states of cold atoms , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) singlets , as ground states of antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin systems , have attracted considerable attention @xcite .",
    "such states are invariant under the action of homogeneous magnetic fields . on the other hand ,",
    "a magnetic field gradient rotates the spins at different locations differently , which leads to the gradual destruction of the singlet state . during",
    "this process , the variance of the collective spin components is increasing and this fact can be used to measure the field gradient .",
    "the advantage of this method is that only a single ensemble is used for differential magnetometry , rather than two ensembles , which leads to a better resolution and also eases the experimental requirements of the method .",
    "the basic scheme for differential magnetometry with singlets is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_chain_and_gaussian ] .",
    "( other methods for measuring the field gradient can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite . )    besides demonstrating the usefulness of multiparticle singlets for metrology , our findings are interesting also to make singlets  visible \" in an experiment .",
    "an insensitivity to homogeneous fields and a growing angular momentum variance due to a field gradient can be strong evidence that a singlet state has indeed been created . if we change the sign of the gradient , then the variances should start to decrease",
    ". such a gradient echo experiment can be another way to analyze singlets .",
    "the accuracy of the magnetic field gradient measurement achieved in an experiment can also be compared to our calculations , and such a comparison could be used as further evidence that a singlet has been created .    finally , our calculations are interesting from the theoretical point of view since we succeed in modeling the quantum dynamics of large atomic ensembles analytically .",
    "this is a surprise as quantum systems with millions of particles are typically difficult to model .",
    "while we mainly discuss spin-@xmath2 particles , the spin squeezing procedure creating singlets and the differential metrology presented in our paper work also for spin-@xmath0 particles for @xmath3 this is very important as looking for applications of ensembles of spin-@xmath0 particles without restricting the dynamics to the spin-@xmath2 subspace is at the center of attention recently from the point of view of experiments and experimental proposals @xcite , and also from the point of view of spin squeezing entanglement criteria @xcite .",
