    "these and some other moments made us think that the basic equations must have energy - momentum balance sense , and these equations should be naturally consistent with the energy - momentum relations introduced by classical maxwell - minkowski equations . during the past years",
    "we have published verious views on the problem , the interested readers may look at the final pages of [ 17 ] . in this paper",
    "we approach the problem from the viewpoint of elasticity : the equations might connect local changes of the above given minkowski stress - energy - momentum tensor and the strain tensors on minkowski space - time , measuring the change of the minkowski metric @xmath16 along the _ eigen vector fields _ @xmath17 of @xmath0 . in other words , _ outside _ electromagnetic field objects the metric may be assumed to be the flat minkowski metric @xmath16 , but _ inside _",
    "such objects where @xmath18 , a consideration of the internal local interaction processes should take in view the values of the lie derivatives @xmath19 , i.e. , should try to look what happens _ inside _ in terms of such quite rapidly arising and vanishing strains / deformations , caused by propagating electromagnetic field objects ( although on unknown media , frequently called _ vacuum _ ) .",
    "the concept of _ strain _ is introduced in studying elastic materials / media subject to external stresses of different nature : mechanical , electromagnetic , etc .",
    "the classical strain describes mainly the abilities of the media to bear stress - actions from outside through deformation , i.e. through changing its shape , or , configuration .",
    "the mathematical counterparts of the allowed deformations are those diffeomorphisms @xmath20 of a riemannian manifold @xmath21 , which change the metric @xmath22 . it is assumed that every such @xmath23 generates a possible configuration of the material considered . since the essential diffeomorphisms @xmath20 must transform the metric @xmath22 to some new metric @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 , the naturally arising tensor field @xmath26 appears as a measure of the physical abilities of the material to withstand external force actions .",
    "it seems reasonable to recall that these diffeomrphisms do _ not _ induce non - zero riemannian curvature .",
    "the continuity of the process of deformation leads to consider 1-parameter group @xmath27\\subset\\mathbb{r}$ ] of deformations , i.e. of local diffeomorphisms .",
    "let the vector field @xmath28 generate @xmath29 , then the quantity @xmath30 i.e. one half of the _ lie derivative _ of @xmath22 along @xmath28 , is called ( infinitesimal ) _ strain / deformation tensor_. 0.2 cm * remark*. further in the paper we shall work with @xmath31 , i.e. the factor @xmath32 will be omitted .",
    "0.2 cm    geometric approach to elasticity is given in [ 18 ] , and relativistic extenstions of the classical elasticity theory may be found in [ 19 ] and in the corresponding quotations therein . in our further study",
    "we shall carry the above given lie derivative definition of strain tensor to the case of minkowski space - time , so we shall call @xmath33 , where @xmath16 is the minkowski ( pseudo)metric and @xmath28 is any _ eigen vector _ of the minkowski stress - energy - momentum tensor @xmath0 , _ eigen strain tensor_.    clearly , the term `` material '' does not seem to be appropriate for photon - like objects ( phlo ) because , as we suggest in the next section , these objects admit no static situations , they are of * entirely dynamical nature * , so the corresponding _ relativistic strain _ tensors must take care of this .",
    "we introduce the following notion of photon - like object(s ) ( we shall use the abbreviation `` phlo '' for `` photon - like object(s ) '' ) :    * phlo are real massless time - stable physical objects with an intrinsically compatible time - stable translational - rotational dynamical structure*.    we give now some explanatory comments , beginning with the term _ real_. * first * we emphasize that this term means that we consider phlo as _ really _ existing _ physical _ objects , not as appropriate and helpful but imaginary ( theoretical ) entities . accordingly ,",
    "phlo * necessarily carry energy - momentum * , otherwise , they could hardly be detected .",
    "* second * , phlo can undoubtedly be _ created _ and _ destroyed _ , so , no point - like and infinite models are reasonable : point - like objects are assumed to have no structure , so they can not be destroyed since there is no available structure to be destroyed ; creation of infinite physical objects ( e.g. plane waves ) requires infinite quantity of energy to be transformed from one kind to another for finite time - period , which seems also unreasonable .",
    "accordingly , phlo are _ spatially finite _ and have to be modeled like such ones , which is the only possibility to be consistent with their `` created - destroyed '' nature .",
    "it seems hardly reasonable to believe that phlo can not be created and destroyed , and that spatially infinite and indestructible physical objects may exist at all . *",
    "third * , `` spatially finite '' implies that phlo may carry only _ finite values _ of physical ( conservative or non - conservative ) quantities .",
    "in particular , the most universal physical quantity seems to be the energy - momentum , so the model must allow finite integral values of energy - momentum to be carried by the corresponding solutions .",
    "* fourth * , `` spatially finite '' means also that phlo _ propagate _ , i.e. they do not `` move '' like classical particles along trajectories , therefore , partial differential equations should be used to describe their evolution in time .",
    "the term `` * massless * '' characterizes physically the way of propagation in terms of appropriate dynamical quantities : the _ integral _",
    "4-momentum @xmath34 of a phlo should satisfy the relation @xmath35 , meaning that its integral energy - momentum vector _ must be isotropic _",
    ", i.e. to have zero module with respect to lorentz - minkowski ( pseudo)metric in @xmath36 .",
    "if the object considered has spatial and time - stable structure , so that the translational velocity of every point where the corresponding field functions are different from zero must be equal to @xmath37 , we have in fact null direction in the space - time _ intrinsically determined _ by a phlo .",
    "such a direction is formally defined by a null vector field @xmath38 .",
    "the integral trajectories of this vector field are isotropic ( or null ) _ straight lines _ as is traditionally assumed in physics .",
    "it follows that with every phlo a null straight line direction is _ necessarily _ associated , so , canonical coordinates @xmath39 on @xmath36 may be chosen such that in the corresponding coordinate frame @xmath40 to have only two non - zero components of magnitude @xmath41 : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 accounts for the two directions along the coordinate @xmath44 ( further such a coordinate system will be called @xmath40-adapted and will be of main usage ) .",
    "our phlo propagates _ as a whole _ along the @xmath40-direction , so the corresponding energy - momentum tensor @xmath45 of the model must satisfy the corresponding _ local isotropy ( null ) condition _ , namely , @xmath46 ( summation over the repeated indices is throughout used ) .    the term `` * translational - rotational * '' means that besides translational component along @xmath40 , the propagation necessarily demonstrates some rotational ( in the general sense of this concept ) component in such a way that _ both components exist simultaneously and consistently _ with each other .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that such kind of behavior should be consistent only with some distinguished spatial shapes .",
    "moreover , if the planck relation @xmath47 must be respected throughout the evolution , the rotational component of propagation should have _ time - periodical _ nature with time period @xmath48 , and one of the two possible , _ left _ or _ right _ , orientations .",
    "it seems reasonable also to expect periodicity in the spatial shape of phlo , which somehow to be related to the time periodicity .",
    "the term `` * dynamical structure * '' means that the propagation is supposed to be necessarily accompanied by an _",
    "internal energy - momentum redistribution _ , which may be considered in the model as energy - momentum exchange between ( or among ) some _ appropriately defined subsystems_. it could also mean that phlo live in a dynamical harmony with the outside world , i.e. _ any outside directed energy - momentum flow should be accompanied by a parallel inside directed energy - momentum flow_.",
    "from formal point of view the standard relativistic formulation of classical electrodynamics in vacuum ( zero charge density ) is based on the following assumptions .",
    "the configuration space is the minkowski space - time @xmath49 where @xmath16 is the pseudometric with @xmath50 with the corresponding volume 4-form @xmath51 and hodge star @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are forms of the same degree .",
    "the electromagnetic field is described by two closed 2-forms @xmath56 .",
    "the physical characteristics of the field are deduced from the following stress - energy - momentum tensor field @xmath57.\\ ] ] note that there is no interaction stress - energy term between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the non - vacuum case the allowed energy - momentum exchange with other physical systems",
    "is given in general by the divergence @xmath58 = f_{\\mu\\nu}(\\delta f)^\\nu + ( * f)_{\\mu\\nu}(\\delta * f)^\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the co - derivative . since @xmath12 , this divergence is obviously equal to zero on the vacuum solutions : its both terms are zero .",
    "therefore , energy - momentum exchange between the two subsystem - fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as suggested by the above divergence terms , should be expressed by @xmath60 summation over @xmath61 , is not allowed on the solutions of @xmath12 .",
    "this shows that the widely used 4-potential approach ( even if two 4-potential 1-forms @xmath62 are introduced so that @xmath63 locally ) to these equations forbids real ( coordinate free ) changes , and excludes any possibility to individualize two energy - momentum exchanging time - recognizable subsystems of the field that are mathematically represented by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    according to the above introduced and discussed concept of phlo we have to impose the condition @xmath46 on the energy tensor ( 1 ) . as is well known [ 20 ] this is equivalent to zero eigen values of @xmath0 , which implies zero invariants : @xmath64 , and that @xmath0 admits just one null eigen direction defined by the vector field @xmath40 , @xmath65 , determining a null straight - line direction along which the energy density propagates translationally .",
    "this isotropic nature of the field leads [ 20 ] to the following structure of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the spatial - like electric and magnetic 1-form components of the field : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , moreover , @xmath72 are eigen vectorsof @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . under these conditions it is possible to find , and convenient to use , a canonical coordinate system @xmath75 such that @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 are two functions , and @xmath43 carries information about the direction of propagation along the coordinate @xmath44 of our phlo .",
    "* remark * all further identifications of tangent and cotangent objects will be made by @xmath16 , and if @xmath68 is a tangent coobject we shall denote by @xmath80 the @xmath16-corresponding tangent object .",
    "0.3 cm since the three vector fields @xmath81 are eigen vectors of @xmath0 , we compute the corresponding three eigen strain tensors .",
    "* proposition*. the following relations hold : @xmath82    * proof*. immediately verified .",
    "0.5 cm    let @xmath83 $ ] denote the lie bracket of vector fields on @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "we note that the local conservation law @xmath88 reduces in our case to @xmath89 , so @xmath79 would be running waves if @xmath90 too .",

    "the above relations show various dynamical aspects of the energy - momentum redistribution during evolution of our phlo in terms of the _ intrinsically _ defined electromagnetic strains .",
    "relation ( 8) shows how the local conservation law @xmath88 , being equivalent to @xmath89 , and meaning that the energy density @xmath103 propagates just translationally along @xmath40 , can be expressed in terms of the eigen strain components . on the other hand the phase function @xmath104 would satisfy @xmath90 only if the introduced quantity @xmath105 is equal to zero : @xmath106 .",
    "now , what is the sense of @xmath105 reveals the following    * proposition*. the following relations hold : @xmath107\\omega_o ; \\\\",

    "* proof*. immediately verified .",
    "these relations say that the 2-dimensional pfaff system @xmath108 is completely integrable for any choice of the two functions @xmath79 , while the two 2-dimensional pfaff systems @xmath109 and @xmath110 are not completely integrable in general , and the same curvature factor @xmath111 determines their nonintegrability .",
    "hence , the condition @xmath112 allows in principle rotational component of propagation , i.e. @xmath113 and @xmath34 not to be plane waves , so compatibility between the translational and rotational components of propagation is possible in principle .",
    "as we mentioned above it is possible the translational and rotational components of the energy - momentum redistribution to be represented in form depending on the @xmath40-directed strains @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "so , the local translational changes of the energy - momentum carried by the two components @xmath1 and @xmath2 of our phlo are given by the two 1-forms @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115)$ ] , and the local rotational ones are given by the 1-forms @xmath116 $ ] and @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "in fact , the 1-form @xmath116 $ ] determines the strain that tends to `` leave '' the 2-plane defined by @xmath109 and the 1-form @xmath117 $ ] determines the strain that tends to `` leave '' the 2-plane defined by @xmath110 .",
    "so , the particular kind of nonintegrability of @xmath109 and @xmath110 mathematically guarantees some physical inter - communication through establishing local dynamical equilibrium ( eq.(7 ) ) between two subsystems of the field , that are mathematically represented by @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "since the phlo is free , i.e. no energy - momentum is lost or gained , this means that the two ( null - field ) components @xmath1 and @xmath2 exchange locally _ equal _ energy - momentum quantities : @xmath99= * \\big[d^*(\\bar{\\zeta})\\wedge a^*\\wedge\\zeta\\big ] .\\ ] ] now , the local energy - momentum conservation law @xmath118=0,\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath89 , requires the corresponding eigen strain - fluxes @xmath115 $ ] and @xmath114 $ ] to become zero : @xmath100= -*\\big[d^*(\\bar{\\zeta})\\wedge a\\wedge\\zeta\\big]= \\frac12l_{\\bar{\\zeta}}\\phi^2\\,\\zeta= i(\\bar{f})\\mathbf{d}f = i(\\bar{*f})\\mathbf{d}(*f)=0 , \\ ] ] and the local dynamical balance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 to hold : @xmath99= * \\big[d^*(\\bar{\\zeta})\\wedge a^*\\wedge\\zeta\\big]= -\\varepsilon\\mathbf{r}\\,\\zeta = -i(\\bar{*f})\\mathbf{d}f = i(\\bar{f})\\mathbf{d}(*f).\\ ] ]    it seems important to note that , only differential relation between the energy - momentum change and natural strain fluxes exists , so no analog of the assumed in elasticity theory generalized hooke law , i.e. linear relation between the stress tensor and the strain tensor , seems to exist here .",
    "this clearly goes along with the fully dynamical nature of phlo , i.e. linear relations exist between the divergence terms of our stress tensor @xmath119 $ ] and the correspondingly directed eigen strain fluxes as given by equations ( 2,7,8 ) .",
    "the constancy of the translational propagation and the required translational - rotational compatibility suggest also constancy of of the rotational component of propagation , i.e. @xmath120 .",

    "we introduced and discussed a concept of photon - like object(s ) ( phlo ) as real , massless time stable physical object(s ) with an intinsically compatible translational - rotational dynamical structure .",
    "so , phlo are spatially finite , with every phlo a straight - line null direction is necessarily associated , and the corresponding stress - energy - momentum tensor must be isotropic : @xmath46 .",
    "we showed that in the frame of the relativistic formulation of vacuum electrodynamics two intrinsically defined strain tensors @xmath136 and @xmath137 can be introduced as corresponding lie derivatives of the flat minkowski metric along eigen vectors of @xmath0 . in terms of the components of these strain tensors",
    "can be defined important characteristics of the internal dynamics of phlo , in particular , internal energy - momentum exchange between the @xmath1-component and @xmath2-component of the free field was explicitly obtained .",
    "definite relations of the projections of @xmath136 and @xmath137 along the null direction of translational propagation to the lie brackets of the electric and magnetic components were also given .",
    "we defined amplitude @xmath132 and phase @xmath104 of phlo and showed that the plane wave character of @xmath132 is admissible and corresponds to the local energy conservation .",
