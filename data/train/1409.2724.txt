    "transport of dissolved solutes in pore fluids in homogeneous porous media results from the synergy between advection and diffusion  @xcite . despite its importance in many applications and fields of research ( e.g. , groundwater remediation ) ,",
    "this process is not yet understood in full detail .",
    "flow through a porous medium causes an increased effective diffusion of the solute , termed dispersion , due to variations in flow velocity within and between the individual pore channels and due to the tortuous pathways the fluid follows through the pores .",
    "the corresponding dispersion coefficients are commonly applied in models based on the advection - diffusion equation ( ade ) to describe spreading of solute in porous media , for example pollutant plumes in ground water , although one should be aware that the ade is only valid under rather restrictive conditions @xcite .",
    "although it is generally agreed that dispersion increases with flow velocity , there is no agreement on the exact relationship between the dispersion coefficient and controlling parameters , such as flow velocity , pore geometry , fluid viscosity , etc .",
    "@xcite .    to study solute transport in homogeneous porous media , a sample of fluid - filled porous material",
    "is subjected to an external pressure head in a specific direction ( taken to be the @xmath0-direction ) .",
    "this results in a fluid flow velocity @xmath1 through the medium , usually expressed in terms of the pclet number , pe @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a typical microscopic length scale ( grain size ) , and @xmath4 a ( ` molecular ' ) diffusion coefficient ( of the solute in the fluid ) .",
    "then , the dispersion of an initially concentrated distribution of solute is studied as it is advected through the medium , while simultaneously experiencing diffusion .",
    "the observed longitudinal ( @xmath5 ) and transverse ( @xmath6 ) dispersion as a function of pclet number ( flow velocity ) is often described by a disjunct set of up to five dispersional regimes  @xcite , using a separate functional relationship ( sometimes referred to as ` correlation ' ) between pclet number and dispersion , @xmath7 , in each regime .",
    "typically , the following regimes are discerned , although the boundaries between the regimes vary somewhat between authors : ( i ) the molecular diffusion regime ( pe @xmath8 ) ; ( ii ) the transition regime ( @xmath9 pe @xmath10 ) ; ( iii ) the major regime ( also known as the power law regime  @xcite ) ( @xmath11 pe @xmath12 ) ; ( iv ) the mechanical dispersion regime ( @xmath13 pe ) ; ( v ) the high pe number regime , sometimes called the inertial or turbulent regime . here , we are concerned with laminar flow only .",
    "we will jointly refer to regimes ( ii ) and ( iii ) as the ` intermediate regime ' , i.e. , intermediate between the diffusive and mechanical dispersion regimes .",
    "quite often , the dispersion in each regime is described by a power law , i.e. , @xmath14 . not surprisingly , for regime ( i ) , @xmath15 , while for regime ( iv ) , @xmath16 . however , in the intermediate regime , exponents differing from these limiting values have been reported to fit experimental data , which has given rise to speculation about their origin  @xcite .",
    "reported values for @xmath17 are @xmath18 ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) , while those for @xmath19 are typically around @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "recently , a simplified heuristic model was proposed to replace this disjunct description of dispersion by a single , unified expression  @xcite .",
    "the model assumes that the advective and diffusive transport mechanisms compete in the pore channels .",
    "then , as the mean flow velocity ( or pressure head ) is increased , transport in ever more pore channels along the solute flow path through the medium will be advection - dominated . by making a simple assumption regarding the growth of the ratio between advection and diffusion dominated channels as the flow is increased , an expression for the net dispersion was derived .",
    "the expression successfully describes experimental data for dispersion in homogeneous porous media over the full range of pclet numbers in laminar flow ( regimes ( i ) to ( iv ) ) .",
    "in particular , it reproduces the faster than linear growth of the longitudinal dispersion with pclet number in the intermediate regime , corresponding to an apparent exponent @xmath21 .",
    "it was claimed that this behavior could be understood from the statistical behavior of tracers in the pore channels .    to clarify the origin of this purported statistical behavior , presumed quite generic for porous media , here we study a highly simplified model for porous media consisting of a network of ( pore ) channels  @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain a clear vision of the impact of the statistical behavior mentioned above on dispersion , the model we chose for this study is as minimalistic as possible , removing any physical mechanisms , such as turbulence and taylor dispersion ( see section [ motivation ] below ) , that might affect these statistical properties .",
    "thus , along the network connections , transport is one - dimensional and strictly diffusive and/or advective .",
    "the effective longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients are extracted from the final numerical solution , after evolving the system in time .",
    "it will be shown that this model does indeed reproduce the dispersion regimes and produces exponents @xmath22 very similar to those obtained in experiments on actual porous media . in this way ,",
    "the minimum ingredients giving rise to the observed dispersional behavior are identified .",
    "furthermore , we will extract statistical information regarding the microscopic transport process that will elucidate the origin of the observed behavior .    clearly , the model has only limited relevance as de detailed model of real systems .",
    "however , we emphasize that this is not its purpose . rather , the model is constructed to discriminate sharply between qualitatively and quantitatively different physical mechanisms .",
    "discrimination is achieved by the combination of several assumptions , namely : ( a ) highly complex three - dimensional porous materials are modeled by a simple two - dimensional network of infinitely thin connections linking nodes .",
    "( b ) fluid flow through the system is imposed and not influenced by the presence of the solute ; in other words , the solute fraction is assumed to be infinitesimally small .",
    "( c ) the fluid flow itself is incompressible , which is a reasonable assumption even in a realistic porous system when the fluid chosen is water or similar .",
    "( d ) the solute is passively transported by the fluid and is not assumed to be subject to independent transport equations ( i.e. , the solute has no inertia and it is not reactive ) .",
    "this simplified model is used to study the effect of network topology on dispersion .",
    "the philosophy of our approach is similar to that of  @xcite . here",
    ", however , we render the model minimalistically .",
    "the objective is to expose the essential ingredients for description of solute transport in porous media .",
    "an important aspect of the model is the use of continuum transport equations for the solute .",
    "this effectively is the use of an infinite number of tracers , which leads to high accuracy results ( not easy to obtain using tracers@xcite ) .",
    "another important aspect is that the numerical model is specifically designed to handle the wide spread of flow velocities in individual channels , typical of general porous media .",
    "to motivate the model , we briefly review the main mechanisms thought to cause dispersion in porous media  @xcite .",
    "fluid flows through a network of pore channels ; we will only consider laminar flow .",
    "then , fluid flow is determined completely by the applied pressure head and the boundary conditions , e.g. , no - slip boundary conditions at the channel walls .",
    "an important observation is that the whole problem of obtaining the fluid flow in the complex geometry and with given boundary conditions is _ linear _ in the applied pressure head : raising the head by a factor @xmath23 will lead to an increase of fluid velocity by the same factor @xmath23 everywhere .",
    "tracers are released into this fluid flow in a small region in space and time , and the tracer cloud is advected passively by the flow .",
    "we assume that the tracers are infinitesimal and massless ( no inertia ) so that they do not interact with each other , do not affect the flow , and follow the flow lines in the absence of diffusion .",
    "further on , we will also consider the effect of ( molecular ) diffusion , but first we discuss pure flow effects .",
    "tracers ( and the fluid itself ) can not leave the network ( particle conservation ) , except at the edge of the model network .",
    "the tracer cloud , traveling through the network , will spread out due to the complex distribution of connections between nodes ( leading to a complex flow pattern ) .",
    "note that this statement implicitly assumes that the flow through the network is such that the tracer cloud will actually spread out , i.e. , that tracers may follow alternative paths leading to different net travelled distances from the point of injection  this excludes , e.g. , homogeneous flows ( @xmath24 constant over all space ) from the analysis .",
    "after some time @xmath25 , sufficiently large for initial transient effects to die out , but not so large that tracers are lost from the system , the size of the tracer cloud can be estimated by its spread @xmath26 here , @xmath0 indicates the set of @xmath0-coordinate values of the tracers , and the angular brackets imply a mean over all tracers .",
    "similar expressions hold for the spread in the other coordinate directions .",
    "the corresponding effective dispersion coefficient can be estimated from @xmath27 in the @xmath0 direction , and similar for the other coordinate directions , assuming the initial size of the tracer cloud is infinitesimally small .",
    "note that we call this dispersion coefficient _ effective _ , as the tracer distribution may deviate from a gaussian shape in specific pore geometries .",
    "deviations from gaussianity may indicate that the ade is an unsatisfactory model for global dispersional behavior @xcite .    in spite of this",
    ", the foregoing effective dispersion coefficient can always be evaluated in finite - size systems at finite times .",
    "as noted , an increase of the pressure head by a factor @xmath23 increases the flow velocity everywhere by that same factor , @xmath28 .    as we have limited ourselves to laminar flow and",
    "exclude turbulence and inertia , tracers will traverse exactly the same paths as they travel through the same porous medium from the same injection point in the new velocity field , but they will travel at a higher speed and hence complete their trajectories in less time , @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we can calculate the dispersion at a different pressure head as follows : @xmath30 using @xmath31 , one obtains @xmath32 for all @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 . in other words , this dispersion ( commonly called ` mechanical ' dispersion ) is proportional to the imposed flow velocity @xmath35 or the applied pressure head .",
    "note that this fundamental property of mechanical dispersion does not depend on the complexity of the flow ( although excessively simple flows are excluded from this argument  see above ) ; all that is required is that the flow velocity everywhere depends linearly on the applied pressure head .",
    "in addition to pure passive advection by the fluid flow , the tracers will also experience a molecular diffusion , the rate of which is determined by the diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 , which we will assume to be constant .",
    "diffusion is essentially distinct from mechanical dispersion in the sense that it is isotropic and non - deterministic .",
    "an additional effect contributing to total dispersion is taylor dispersion  @xcite . in a flow field with shear",
    "( such that neighboring flow lines have different velocities ) , diffusion may lead to a homogenization of the velocity field , leading to an increased dispersion .",
    "this effect occurs only when the mean flow velocity is small with respect to the diffusion coefficient , i.e. , when the pclet number is sufficiently small . in his original paper ,",
    "taylor derived an explicit expression for this condition , applicable to laminar flow through a straight pipe ; namely pe @xmath36 ( here , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the length and radius of the pipe , respectively ) .",
    "this condition typically is met over most of the intermediate dispersion regime of interest here . provided",
    "this condition is satisfied , the resulting dispersion is proportional to the _ square _ of the velocity ( or pclet number ) .",
    "taylor dispersion often is invoked to explain how the longitudinal dispersion exponent @xmath39 may exceed 1 in the intermediate regime in porous media  @xcite . the main motivation for this claim appears to be that taylor dispersion is one of the few available physical mechanisms that provides faster than linear growth ( of the dispersion ) with pe number . to clarify whether taylor dispersion is necessary for the description of dispersion in homogeneous porous media ,",
    "the simplified model we present below provides a sharp discrimination among causes .",
    "it is constructed such that there are no neighboring flow lines that might lead taylor dispersion in the presence of diffusion ( enhanced effective diffusion due to flow velocity differences within a channel or network node ) .",
    "therefore , if the model reproduces the dispersional behavior observed experimentally , taylor dispersion may not be construed as a necessary ingredient of dispersion models for homogeneous porous media .",
    "while the underlying model itself is not new , the simplification is , and the resulting analysis and interpretation are also .",
    "specifically we are able to : ( a ) show the evolution of the dispersion coefficients with pclet number over a very broad range and explain the origin of this behavior ; ( b ) clarify the contribution of taylor dispersion ; and ( c ) report the observation of a phase transition . in the future ,",
    "the proposed analysis and interpretation described here may be applied to more complex and realistic models .",
    "the model consists of a network of straight , one - dimensional flow channels which connect nodes .",
    "each point in the network is characterized by a single velocity , unaffected by neighboring velocities .",
    "we model global transport across the network due solely to advection and diffusion . along each connection , the diffusion coefficient @xmath40 and the advective velocity @xmath35 are known and constant .",
    "transport along each such a connection is therefore described by the one - dimensional transport equation @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is a local coordinate along the connection , while @xmath43 is the probability ( or concentration ) .",
    "the flux is given by @xmath44 so that eq .",
    "( [ transport ] ) can also be written @xmath45 .",
    "the system is discretized such that @xmath43 is only known at the nodes of the network , @xmath46 . starting from an initial distribution @xmath47 , we wish to evolve @xmath48 in time across the whole network , implying that we need to find @xmath49 at the nodes . to avoid probability leakage between the discrete nodes ,",
    "the flux must be conserved in - between nodes , i.e. , along each connection .",
    "hence @xmath50 along the channels ( though not at the nodes ) .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) one obtains the shape of the solution along the channel : @xmath51 with two integration constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "a two - dimensional network consists of @xmath54 nodes at positions @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "a higher dimensional network simply means using a larger number of coordinates ; all the other considerations and calculations remain essentially the same .",
    "an @xmath57 connection matrix @xmath58 specifies to which other nodes each node @xmath59 is connected : @xmath60 if node @xmath61 is connected to node @xmath59 , and @xmath62 otherwise ( @xmath63 is a symmetric matrix without trace , @xmath64 ) . in view of the fact that nodes are only connected to near neighbors , @xmath58 is a sparse matrix .",
    "sparse matrix techniques therefore are appropriate .",

    "to better understand the origin of this super - linear growth of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient , we have calculated the distribution of solute over channels with different pe@xmath179 values , eq .",
    "( [ peloc ] ) , as a function of the fluid velocity @xmath1 ( fig .  [ ellestats_2d ] ) .",
    "perhaps unsurprisingly , the distribution of solute shifts towards channels with higher pe@xmath179 as @xmath1 is raised , i.e. , towards advection - dominated channels .",
    "this shift is mainly due to the fact that the number pe@xmath179 for a given channel is linear in @xmath1 itself ; obvious though this may be , it constitutes the essential ingredient of the explanation of @xmath180 , discussed below .",
    "furthermore , a gradual change of the _ shape _ of the distribution is visible as @xmath1 is raised ; however , this change is rather subtle . to quantify and visualize this change , fig .",

    "the skewness @xmath183 of the distribution is also shown ; @xmath184 is also enhanced in the transition regime around @xmath182 .",
    "thus , the solute distribution over pore channels with different pe@xmath179 values is broader and more asymmetric in the transition regime .",
    "the correlation between the ` solute velocity ' @xmath146 and the imposed flow @xmath72 , calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ correlation ] ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ elle_corr ] . naturally , this correlation is very small ( or zero ) for very low @xmath1 , and positive and finite for very large @xmath1 , approaching a constant value for @xmath185 .",
    "however , there is a perhaps unexpected and rather strong correlation peak _ prior to _ the intermediate regime , around @xmath186 .",
    "the explanation for this can be gleaned from fig .",
    "[ square_solution ] .",
    "although this figure refers to the square grid , the essential behavior here is similar . at low @xmath187 ( the ` diffusive regime ' ) , solute transport is purely diffusive and hence correlation is low .",
    "as @xmath1 is increased but still small ( of the order of @xmath186 , the ` transition regime ' ) , the solute cloud still predominantly expands diffusively , thus reaching a large proportion of the grid , yet it starts to ` sense ' the advective drift in all channels , which leads to a large correlation . at still higher @xmath1 ,",
    "the solute cloud is less able to expand , as it becomes confined to the predominantly advective channels , and the correlation gradually drops towards a final limiting value ( corresponding to the mechanical dispersion regime , @xmath185 ) .",
    "note the oscillation between @xmath188 and @xmath189 , associated with the ` major regime ' .",
    "transport in the highly simplified model for porous media studied here ( a network of nodes connected by one - dimensional channels , while transport through the channels is purely advective and diffusive ) exhibits several of the features also observed in laboratory experiments on porous media : ( a ) the diffusive regime at low pclet number and ( b ) the mechanical dispersion regime at high pclet number are correctly recovered . in the intermediate regime , ( c ) the longitudinal dispersion generally grows faster than linear ( @xmath180 ) , whereas ( d ) the transverse dispersion grows much slower ( and @xmath190 ) .",
    "an exception to this , among the various networks studied , is the tile grid , in which longitudinal connectivity was purposely reduced by a factor of two with respect to the square grid .",
    "this reduced longitudinal connectivity brings longitudinal dispersion down to a level comparable to the transverse dispersion , showing that network topology affects dispersion in a profound manner .",
    "[ square_solution ] is illustrative of the generic behavior of dispersion as the flow velocity @xmath1 is increased at constant diffusivity @xmath4 : the solute tends to be drawn preferentially into advection - dominated channels as the fluid velocity increases . in other words , at low velocity , the solute expands randomly through all types of channel , but at high velocity , it explores much more advection - dominated ( i.e. , horizontal ) channels than diffusion - dominated ( vertical ) channels .",
    "hence , on average , the solute will tend to spend more time in advection - dominated channels as @xmath1 is raised .",
    "note that this is the basic assumption underlying the heuristic model of  @xcite .",
    "the fact that this model qualitatively reproduces the dispersional behavior observed in actual experiments on homogeneous porous media , while taylor dispersion is absent by definition , implies that taylor dispersion is not required to obtain @xmath180 in the intermediate regime .",
    "while this does not prove that taylor dispersion is not relevant in actual porous media , it suggests that the relevance of taylor dispersion for the explanation of the observed behavior ( @xmath21 ) needs to be reviewed carefully .",
    "perfectly regular grids such as the square and hexagonal grids presented above are somewhat pathological and suffer from the fact that many channels are exactly perpendicular to the mean flow direction ( the @xmath0-axis ) .",
    "this means that these channels are ` stagnant ' , and transport through them is purely diffusive , regardless of @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath1 is increased , the transport flux through these channels becomes negligible with respect to the total flux , so that the transport topology of the system becomes effectively one - dimensional . to avoid this topological breakdown ,",
    "the positions of the main nodes of the network are ` wiggled ' slightly from their nominal positions . with the square and hexagonal grids , the quantifier @xmath172 stagnates in the range @xmath191 ( cf",
    ".  figs .",
    "[ square ] and [ hexagonal ] ) .",
    "it turns out that in this range , there is a gradual shift of the solute concentration towards channels with higher velocities , which however is undetected by the @xmath172 quantifier since the the corresponding part of the solute already resides in channels with pe@xmath192 ( as can be verified by computing a graph like fig .",
    "[ ellestats_2d ] for these cases ) .",
    "this effect arises because of the regular structure of the grid , causing the channels to fall into a very reduced number of classes .",
    "this situation is considered somewhat unrealistic , as actual porous media will never be perfectly regular ( not to mention the fact that there , structure is three - dimensional rather than two - dimensional ) . by comparison with the regular grids , the `` elle '' grid has the advantage of offering more gradual ( realistic ? ) variations of quantities such as @xmath172 , facilitating their study and understanding .",
    "thus , we focus attention on the `` elle '' grid results .    the statistical quantifier @xmath172 , indicating the ` number of tracers ' ( amount of solute ) in advective channels versus diffusive channels , increases systematically as @xmath1 is raised .",
    "the point where @xmath172 reaches 1 was found to immediately precede the moment when @xmath39 reaches 1 for all grids ( with the exception of the tile grid , in which @xmath193 ) .",
    "this observation is consistent with the analytic model of  @xcite , in which the growth of the quantifier @xmath172 with @xmath1 was hypothesized to be the cause of @xmath21 in the intermediate pclet number regime in porous media : as @xmath1 increases , not only does the velocity of the solute tracers increase ( trivially ) , but also the number of tracers in advective ( @xmath138 ) versus diffusive ( @xmath139 ) channels , thus giving rise to a faster than linear increase of global longitudinal dispersion in the intermediate regime .",
    "furthermore , with the `` elle '' ( two - dimensional foam ) network , fig .",
    "[ elle ] shows that @xmath172 grows linearly , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , in the range @xmath196 . for smaller values of @xmath1 ,",
    "fluid flow is so slow that no channels are classified as ` advective ' ( @xmath197 ) , while for higher values of @xmath1 , no channels are classified as ` diffusive ' ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "thus , the fact that this power law only appears to exist over a finite range of @xmath1 values is merely due to the crudeness of the channel classification criterion .",
    "the main message of this result is that the ratio of solute in ` advective ' and ` diffusive ' channels increases systematically as the fluid flow @xmath1 is increased , in accordance with the prediction of  @xcite .    when plotting the distribution of solute over channels with different pe@xmath179 values as a function of the fluid velocity @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ ellestats_2d ] ) , it appears that the system experiences a ` phase transition ' from low fluid velocities ( @xmath199 ) to high velocities ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "this phase transition is reflected in the width and skewness of the ( logarithmic ) distribution of pe@xmath179 , fig .",
    "[ ellestats_width ] , which peak at the transition .",
    "the phase transition arises spontaneously from the complexity of the flow patterns in the two - dimensional network , and is related to the super - linear growth of the dispersion @xmath201 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "the idea of a phase transition is justified from the point of view that at very low velocities , mean solute motion is essentially independent from the imposed advection , whereas at high velocities it moves almost exclusively with the ( deterministic , externally imposed ) fluid flow , corresponding to a change from an uncorrelated to a correlated state .",
    "this change of state is not gradual , but involves a rather sharp correlation peak , as shown in fig .",
    "[ elle_corr ] , which can be understood from the explanation given in the previous section . here",
    ", we simply note that a sharp increase of correlation is typical of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "note that the quantifier @xmath172 plays the role of an ` order parameter ' of the phase transition .",
    "in particular , its derivative with respect to pe ( or ` susceptibility ' ) is large at around @xmath202 ( fig .",
    "[ elle ] ) , which roughly corresponds to the point where the width of the distribution of pe@xmath179 , fig .",
    "[ ellestats_width ] , becomes large .",
    "we emphasize that this model only offers a limited degree of realism due to its simplicity .",
    "however , the statistical analysis outlined here should be easy to apply to more realistic simulations of tracer transport in porous media  @xcite and to detailed tracer velocity measurements in actual porous material samples facilitated by nmr techniques  @xcite . that would provide final and definitive support for the clarification of the origin of the enhanced dispersion exponent , @xmath21 , in the intermediate regime , as discussed here .",
    "also , the analysis of the motion of individual tracers should allow a more complete analysis of the phase transition indicated here : tracer motion makes a transition from random motion ( in the diffusive phase ) to deterministic motion ( in the advective phase ) .",
    "this change should be reflected in the correlation length between the velocities of individual tracers .",
    "in this work , we have modeled transport through porous media by means of a two - dimensional network of one - dimensional channels ( ` pores ' ) linking nodes . along each channel , advection and diffusion was modeled using the one - dimensional advection - diffusion equation .",
    "the numerical solution method is based on the requirement that no solute is lost between network nodes .",
    "this fact stabilizes the numerical time evolution of the solution , even at very high advective velocities .",
    "the latter constitutes an advantage for the study of dispersion in a network with a wide range of local flow velocities .",
    "we studied a range of network types , advancing the time solution from an initial state in which the solute was concentrated at a central node to a time when a stop criterion was satisfied . at the stop time",
    ", the effective longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients were determined . for each network ,",
    "a range of flow velocities was explored .",
    "the results indicate that the main effects of dispersion in porous media observed in laboratory experiments in homogenous porous media ( in particular , the behavior of the dispersion coefficients in the intermediate regime , as already predicted in  @xcite ) can be reproduced using a minimal model containing only the mentioned ingredients : a simplified pore geometry ( network ) , diffusion , and advection .",
    "thus , some hypothetic dispersion mechanisms invoked by other authors ( e.g. , taylor dispersion , anomalous diffusion or fractality  @xcite ) are not needed to obtain these effects , as the observed dispersional behavior already emerges spontaneously in this highly simplified model .",
    "the results also constitute a verification of the basic assumption underlying the analytic model of  @xcite , namely the growth of @xmath172 as @xmath1 is increased , although the actual functional form depends on the specific network type .",
    "this novel quantity therefore plays a crucial role in the understanding of the origin of the nonlinear behavior of the dispersion coefficients in the intermediate regime .",
    "an analysis of the distribution of solute over channels with specific pe@xmath179 values indicates that this distribution experiences a ` phase transition ' from an unordered low - velocity state to an ordered high - velocity state . the width and skewness of the distribution peak in the intermediate regime , at the velocity ( @xmath182 ) where the growth exponent of longitudinal dispersion ( @xmath39 ) exceeds 1 .",
