    "one of the first and still most striking observations at rhic is a strong event anisotropy in non - central collisions @xcite , which is generated through the elliptically deformed overlap region of the colliding nuclei , resulting in an eccentric distribution of matter and anisotropic pressure gradients in the early stages of the expansion @xcite . from a microscopic point of view",
    "this strong collective anisotropy is best described under the assumption of extremely strong rescattering @xcite , strong enough in fact to reach the limit of continuum dynamics , whose predictions @xcite were in quantitative agreement with first observations @xcite .",
    "to achieve such a strong conversion of anisotropies from coordinate to momentum space , rescattering has to be strong at very early times and local thermalization has to occur while the geometric deformation of the source is still large @xcite .",
    "more detailed subsequent hydrodynamic studies of non - central collisions gave additional predictions on characteristic features such as the mass dependence of elliptic flow @xcite and investigated the influence of characteristics of the underlying equation of state @xcite .",
    "results of such studies are given in figure 1 , where the left panel shows the momentum dependence of elliptic flow @xmath0 , the second fourier coefficient of the azimuthal dependence of the particle spectra @xmath1 , as a function of transverse momentum for pions and protons .",
    "experimental data from minimum bias collisions @xcite are compared to hydrodynamic results @xcite , once applying an equation of state including a phase transition to a plasma stage ( solid lines ) , once using a soft resonance gas equation even at the earliest and hottest stages of the collision ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the right panel of the figure shows the average elliptic flow of all charged particles as a function of centrality .",
    "included are results of a hydrodynamic calculation assuming different latent heats @xmath2 of the transition region ( 0.4 , 0.8 and 1.6 gev/@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "clearly these results indicate that in order to describe the absolute magnitude , the mass splitting and the centrality dependence of elliptic flow , rapid thermalization with a strong push from a phase with a sufficiently hard equation of state ( like the qcd plasma ) and a fairly soft transition region ( of width @xmath4  gev/@xmath3 ) back to hadronic matter is required .    )",

    "with the prerequisites of a thermalized , adiabatically evolving source given , there is a wealth of topics that we can address within the hydrodynamic framework .    * more quantitative extraction of the properties of the equation of state : * hydrodynamics is _ the tool _ to study how properties of the equation of state influence the dynamics of the system and final state observables , as the equation of state , which relates the local energy density to the pressure , explicitly enters the formalism in terms of the forces that drive the system apart . with the large variety of flow observables becoming currently available",
    ", we will be able to delimit parameters of the calculation , and particularly put stronger constraints on features of the nuclear equation of state by comparing experimental data with theoretical calculations .",

    "newest results on particle spectra of strange and multi - strange baryons are yet inconclusive to which extent these species follow the collective dynamics .",
    "while the traditional blast wave fit tends to assign them a higher temperature of origin @xcite , they appear to follow the common mass systematics of the full hydrodynamic calculation down to freeze - out temperatures of 100 mev @xcite .",
    "signals attributed to decaying charmed mesons @xcite do not yet prove or disprove whether even heavy flavors participate in the strong collectivity @xcite .",
    "whereas the question of flow of strangeness in the hadronic phase is still debatable , there is clear evidence from flow anisotropies of strange particles @xcite that at hadronization all quark flavors share the same radial as well as anisotropic flow @xcite , providing a clear sign of early thermalization and a common collective expansion of the fireball in the partonic stage .    *",
    "equation of state at larger baryon densities : * flow observables at forward / backward rapidities open the possibility to study the nuclear equation of state at larger baryon densities than found at central rapidity , and thus allow to scan a larger portion of the @xmath7-plane of our nuclear equation of state , eventually bringing us into the realm of the expected tri - critical point @xcite .",
    "this issue is however complicated through the breakdown of thermalization when moving toward the fragmentation region @xcite . before one can make quantitative statements about the equation of state in this realm , the exceedingly complicated interplay of initial conditions , viscous effects and the equation of state have to be well understood .",

    "deviations from this behavior are expected in the most peripheral collisions , when approaching the fragmentation region , in the late stages of the reaction and for the few particles emitted with large transverse momenta . under these conditions ,",
    "viscosity effects need to be considered @xcite .",
    "although the treatment of those effects within a full dynamical calculation is a very difficult task @xcite , it will eventually enrich our understanding of the transport properties of the quark gluon plasma and the hadron gas , and maybe resolve the persisting hbt - puzzle at rhic @xcite .",
    "* background medium for hard probes : * hydrodynamics has proved to be a great tool to study the properties of the bulk of the expanding matter .",
    "even hard probes , although they do not follow the collective dynamics of the bulk , depend on the dynamical evolution of the fireball . the characteristics of energy - loss and jet - quenching should thus be folded into the hydrodynamic expansion , to get a reliable description of the net energy loss which the hard probes experience during the fireball evolution @xcite .",
    "to address the thermodynamic properties of the medium created at rhic , it is essential that the system rapidly achieves local thermal equilibrium , which appears to happen within the first 1 fm/@xmath9 after impact . the most natural language to study the nuclear equation of state , its influence on the dynamics of the system and the resulting observables is hydrodynamics .",
    "with the steady output of flow observables from rhic we can constrain the parameters of the equation of state which is responsible for the observed strong collective expansion , but also address questions of viscosity and other non - ideal effects . *",
