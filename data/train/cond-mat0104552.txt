    "after significant plastic deformation , the dislocation tangles in crystals often organize themselves into sharp walls separating nearly dislocation - free cells ; the crystallographic axes rotate slightly across each cell boundary .",
    "these cells undergo refinement ( become smaller ) under increased deformation , and recent experiments@xcite indicate that both the misorientation angles and the cell sizes have power - law scaling with material - independent scaling forms for the probability distributions .",
    "we introduce here a simple model of cell division and rotational diffusion which exhibits this type of scaling , and which provides insights into the origins for the experimental scaling distributions .",
    "in particular , we argue that cell division ( driving the refinement ) is responsible for the linear growth of the misorientation scaling distribution at small angles .",
    "cell boundaries are distinct from grain boundaries in that their misorientation angle across them is small ( at most a few degrees ) and they form in a nonequilibrium process , typically at temperatures where diffusion is not relevant ( so , for example , the impurity segregation characteristic of many grain boundaries is not observed at cell boundaries ) . as deformation proceeds , the cell structure refines ( the average cell size @xmath0 becomes smaller ) , and the average cell misorientation angle @xmath1 grows .",
    "the cell boundaries are separated into into two classes .",
    "an early work@xcite called them `` ordinary cell walls '' and `` dense dislocation walls '' ; later authors@xcite have called them gnbs ( `` geometrically necessary boundaries '' ) and idbs ( `` incidental dislocation boundaries '' ) .",
    "the gnb s typically align roughly parallel to one another , have larger misorientation angles , and are longer , often forming the boundaries of two or more cells .",
    "( the term `` geometrically necessary '' is unfortunate .",
    "geometrically necessary _ dislocations _ are those required to mediate macroscopic strain gradients and rotation gradients , as distinguished from geometrically unnecessary dislocations whose burgers vectors cancel out on long length scales .",
    "all cell walls are associated with small relative rotations between cells , and are hence composed of geometrically necessary dislocations on scales comparable to the cell sizes . on longer scales , far from building up large macroscopic rotations , the rotations mediated by neighboring geometrically necessary _ boundaries _ tend to cancel@xcite , leading to little or no long - range rotation gradient . hence , as cell boundaries , the gnb s are most akin to the geometrically unnecessary dislocations . )",
    "hughes _ et al._@xcite studied the distribution functions for these two types of cell walls , and found a simple scaling behavior , largely independent of material .",
    "in particular , for the gnbs , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while for the idbs @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the magnitude of the net plastic strain . moreover , data for several materials and different strain amplitudes all collapse onto apparently universal scaling curves @xmath7 and @xmath8 when rescaled to the average angle : @xmath9 and @xmath10 we will study the scaling of these probability distributions @xmath11 and @xmath12 using a simple model .",
    "how much of this apparently universal behavior can be captured in a simple model of cell rotation and refinement ?",
    "the model we propose is one in which cells become smaller by subdivision ( leading to a fragmentation theory for the size distribution ) , and undergo random angular reorientations as the strain increases .",
    "our model does not incorporate the anisotropy in the external strain field , and so has nothing to say about how cell structure morphology might change , say , between tensile and rolling deformation or as the crystalline orientation changes .",
    "one should view our model as a caricature of the real system ; our results suggest that the experimentally observed scaling behavior may be generic to any microscopic mechanism which fragments and randomly reorients cells .",
    "our computational model starts with one large cubical cell .",
    "we assume a cubic crystal , with initial crystalline axes aligned with the axes of our cube , so the initial orientation is described by a rotation matrix @xmath13 equal to an identity matrix .",
    "the dynamics of our model incorporates two pieces : rotational diffusion and cell splitting events .",
    "* rotational diffusion .",
    "* the orientation of each cell @xmath14 undergoes a simple random walk in rotation angle space , with strain increments playing the role of the time step .",
    "it is convenient to write the current orientation @xmath15 , where the matrix @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 the totally antisymmetric tensor ) generates an infinitesimal rotation about the @xmath18 axis .",
    "since the cell boundary misorientation angles experimentally are small ( around a degree or so ) , we may expand the exponential in this expression , @xmath19 ( large angle corrections are discussed in @xcite and @xcite . ) in this approximation , diffusion in the manifold of crystalline orientations can be written as an ordinary diffusion equation in the three - dimensional coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "if we assume @xmath21 is a monotonically increasing strain , then the three - dimensional probability distribution of grain orientations @xmath22 evolves according to the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the `` orientational diffusion constant '' and the laplacian @xmath25 the random walk described by this diffusion equation is implemented numerically by adding a gaussian random vector to @xmath26 with components of root - mean - square length @xmath27 whenever the strain for the cell is incremented by @xmath28 .",
    "* cell splitting events . * our model , for simplicity ,",
    "divides cells only along planes perpendicular to one of the crystalline axes .",
    "thus our cell structure is composed of rectangular parallelepipeds .",
    "the rate of cell division in our model depends only on the current size and shape of the cell , and not on its environment .",
    "there are several different physical mechanisms that might be responsible for cell division . broadly speaking ,",
    "we classify them by dimensional analysis : there are mechanisms that divide cells at a rate proportional to their current volume @xmath29 , their current surface area @xmath30 , their current perimeter @xmath31 , or at a uniform rate independent of the current size @xmath32 .",
    "once a cell has been chosen to split , we must choose an axis and a position along that axis to place the new cell wall . to keep our aspect ratios reasonable ,",
    "we ve chosen the probability of splitting along a given axis proportional to the length of the cell along that axis .",
    "the position of the new cell wall along the split axis is chosen randomly in all cases .",
    "the two cells formed by splitting inherit their parent s orientation : the new cell walls thus start out at zero misorientation angle , which will be important when we study the misorientation angle distribution .    our model for cell",
    "splitting is closely related to a well - studied model of fragmentation@xcite . in fragmentation theory , the splitting rate is assumed a function of the volume , so for example a cell of volume @xmath29 could fracture with a rate @xmath33 . in our problem ,",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 correspond precisely to uniform and volume cell splitting rates , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 approximately correspond to perimeter and area splitting .",
    "the evolution law in fragmentation theory corresponding to our model is easily seen to be@xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the concentration of fragments with volume @xmath29 . to relate this to experimental measurements ( equation  [ eqn : scalinglength ] ) , which produce probability distributions of lengths rather than concentrations of volumes",
    ", we can change variables from @xmath29 to @xmath40 .",
    "the probability distribution of lengths with all cells weighted uniformly is @xmath41    = 2.5truein 0.1truein = 2.5truein    the histograms produced by our simulations are a result of three choices .",
    "first , there is a choice in how we define the size ( length @xmath42 ) of the cell . in computing the averages and histograms from the simulation data ,",
    "we typically define the size of a cell to be its length along any one of the axes : all three lengths are incorporated into the averages and histograms .",
    "this definition of size corresponds to that used in experiment .",
    "alternatively , in order to compare the histograms from the simulation to fragmentation theory ( which keeps track only of the volumes , not the shapes , of the cells ) , we can define the size of the cell as the cube root of the volume .",
    "second , there is a choice in the splitting dynamics as discussed above : cells can divide at rates proportional to their volume , surface area , perimeter , or at a uniform rate . in fragmentation theory ,",
    "the rate of splitting is proportional to @xmath43 as discussed below : thus fragmentation theory is exact for our simulation with volume splitting ( @xmath35 ) and uniform splitting rates ( @xmath34 ) , but does not directly apply to the perimeter and surface simulations , whose splitting rates depend upon the shapes of the cells as well as their volumes .",
    "finally , one must address how to weigh the contributions of different cells in the probability distribution .",
    "for example , an experiment which measures cell sizes by taking an xy cross section and then weighting each observed cell equally in the average is effectively weighting the three dimensional cells by their extent in the z direction ( roughly weighting each cell by its perimeter or by @xmath42 ) .",
    "we compute the averages and histograms from the simulation data by weighting each cell uniformly or by its volume , surface area , or perimeter .",
    "we will soon see that the scaling exponents for the average size depend on only the splitting dynamics , @xmath44 , not on the measurement of size or the weight of the distribution .",
    "we will also see that the shape of the scaled probability distributions changes with different measurements of size or weights , but the distributions scale nonetheless .",
    "if we define the size of the cell as the cube root of the volume , simulations that split cells at a uniform rate or at a rate proportional to the volume of the cell produce histograms that agree well with those given by fragmentation theory ( equation [ eqn : ctorho ] ) .",
    "however , simulations that split cells at rates proportional to area and perimeter produce histograms that are shifted from equation  ( [ eqn : ctorho ] ) .",
    "we focus here on the case where the rate is proportional to the surface area @xmath30 of the cell ( area ) and the case where the rate is independent of the size and shape of the cell ( uniform ) .",
    "= 2.5truein 0.1truein = 2.5truein    figures ( [ fig : cellmorphologies ] ) show the cell morphologies from the two simulations .",
    "area splitting shows a fairly uniform density of cell sizes : this is characteristic also of the other size - dependent cell division rates .",
    "uniform cell splitting rates produce a broad range of sizes : most cells are very small , so most cell divisions subdivide very small cells . indeed , as we shall discuss below , the uniform model is at a critical point in fragmentation theory ( the `` shattering '' transition@xcite ) .",
    "experimentally , there does not seem to be a consensus on whether the cell size distribution is fractal@xcite or whether it has a more traditional scaling distribution with a characteristic size which shrinks with time@xcite .",
    "figures ( [ fig : meansizes ] ) shows the mean cell size as it evolves with increasing strain in our model , under area splitting and random splitting . in the figure",
    ", we show a count average where each cell contributes equally , a perimeter average where cells are weighted by their perimeter , and area and volume average .",
    "each of these has the size of the cell defined as the distance between parallel cell walls .",
    "the fourth average has the size defined as the cube root of the volume and is weighted uniformly .",
    "the mean size for the cells in the area splitting model scales with @xmath45 .",
    "assuming fragmentation theory ( equation  [ eqn : fragmentationevolution ] ) and scaling ( equation  [ eqn : scalinglength ] , which can be derived from fragmentation theory@xcite for @xmath46 ) , it is easy , use equation [ eqn : scalinglength ] to compute @xmath47 , change variables to @xmath48 , and substitute in the scaling form equation [ eqn : scalinglength ] . ] to derive the power - law relation @xmath49 .",
    "thus the experimentally observed scaling of the idb sizes suggests a cell splitting rate proportional to the cell surface area ( left side of the figures ) , while the scaling @xmath50 of the gnb dislocations would suggest a mechanism with a cell splitting rate scaling as the cell volume to the @xmath51 power .",
    "( see , however , part  ( 2 ) in the conclusion . )",
    "figures ( [ fig : cellsize ] ) show the histograms of cell sizes at the end of our simulation , with the five weights discussed above . naturally , for example , if cells are weighted by their volume there is more weight in the histogram at larger sizes .",
    "we first consider the left - hand panel , showing the simulation results with dynamics which split cells proportional to their surface area .",
    "the area splitting histograms , taken at different @xmath6 during our simulations , do indeed rapidly converge to those shown on the left panel of figure  ( [ fig : cellsize ] ) ( hence validating the scaling form equation  ( [ eqn : scalinglength ] ) ) .",
    "however one defines the size @xmath42 or how one weights the contribution of each cell , the histograms collapse onto scaling functions .",
    "= 2.5truein 0.1truein = 2.5truein    fragmentation theory@xcite calculates the scaling function explicitly that describes the distribution of sizes at late times .",
    "in particular , for area splitting ( @xmath37 ) , the scaling function in ( [ eqn : scalinglength ] ) for a uniformly weighted distribution is @xmath52 shown as the dashed line on the left in figure ( [ fig : cellsize ] ) .",
    "as expected , it does indeed agree well with the size distribution where @xmath42 is defined as the cube root of the volume .",
    "the shift between these two curves is due to the difference in dynamics : our simulation splits cells at a rate proportional to the actual area of the cell , not by @xmath53 . for volume",
    "splitting , with l defined as the cube root of the volume , the histograms from the simulation agree with those from fragmentation theory as expected .    the histograms which measure the length , width , and height of each cell are broader than those that measure the cube root of the volume .",
    "cells with large aspect ratios will contribute one or two dimensions that are smaller than the cube root of volume and one or two that are larger .",
    "notice that in figure ( [ fig : cellsize ] ) the cell size probability density does not vanish at zero size @xmath42 except for statistical weightings that involve the total volume . in our model ,",
    "a subdivision occurs with equal probability at all thicknesses , so the probability density at zero thickness is finite .",
    "if the weights of the cells in the average is by the total volume , of course , then the thin cells contribute vanishing weight so the histogram goes to zero .",
    "consider now the right - hand panel of figure ( [ fig : cellsize ] ) , with simulation results for dynamics which split cells at a uniform rate independent of their size .",
    "notice first that the scales are logarithmic : there is an enormous range of cell sizes , with peak probabilities ( by most measures ) at very small sizes .",
    "the uniform splitting model is at a critical point in the parameter @xmath34 , the _ shattering transition _",
    "@xcite , beyond which ( @xmath54 ) there an infinite dust of zero - size particles . at this critical point",
    ", there are exact solutions for the cell size distribution ( dashed curve shown in figure  ( [ fig : cellsize ] ) , to be compared with the @xmath40 simulation curve ) .",
    "this exact solution does not have the scaling form of equation  ( [ eqn : scalinglength ] ) .",
    "we have not been able to find a generalization of the scaling form which collapses the distribution at the critical point , but the scaling variable ( typical size ) must shrink exponentially as @xmath6 grows .",
    "one hint for why finding the scaling function may be difficult is that the system appears not to be self - averaging : the relatively good agreement between the theory and simulation shown on the right of figure  ( [ fig : cellsize ] ) is not as true with other random number seeds , with fluctuations of an order of magnitude away from the theory .",
    "( the average over many seeds does agree with the calculated form . )",
    "while there is no scaling form solution to equation ( [ eqn : fragmentationevolution ] ) for @xmath34 , we have found a family of formal , non - normalizable solutions of the form @xmath55 .",
    "= 8.cm    to study the misorientation angles , we need a formula for the misorientation angle @xmath56 .",
    "imagine a cell boundary as in figure ( [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the rotation @xmath57 takes the crystalline axes of right - hand cell to the orientation on the left - hand side of the boundary . as before , we can write this rotation as @xmath58 , and correspondingly write @xmath59 and @xmath60 in terms of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . because the rotation angles are small across cell boundaries , @xmath63",
    ". the misorientation angle is @xmath64    define @xmath65 to be the area of cell boundary with misorientation matrix @xmath66 .",
    "since this distribution for our model is symmetric under rotations , equation ( [ eqn : ntotheta ] ) implies that the probability distribution for the misorientation angle @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the total cell boundary area . notice that the ( one - dimensional ) probability density for small angles @xmath56 is @xmath69 times the ( three - dimensional ) cell boundary area at one of the rotations @xmath26 corresponding to @xmath70",
    "this is of course because the number of possible rotations grows with misorientation angle , like the area of a sphere in rotation space .",
    "this has the important consequence of making @xmath11 vanish at @xmath71 ; this reflects not some special physics which avoids small misorientation angles , but a simple geometrical fact that a small net misorientation angle demands three independent rotation angles all being small .",
    "indeed , we will see that the experimental misorientation distribution vanishes not as @xmath72 as would seem natural from equation ( [ eqn : lambdantorhotheta ] ) , but as @xmath56 .",
    "we will explain this , and the corresponding cusp in @xmath73 , when we incorporate the effects of cell division , which provides a source of new boundaries at zero misorientation angle .",
    "figure [ fig : misorientations ] shows the misorientations we measure for our area splitting model . as for the cell sizes , the misorientations across cell walls can be averaged weighting them uniformly , by the cell wall perimeter , or by its area .",
    "we see that the mean misorientation angle in our model grows with @xmath74 , as does the experimental misorientations across the idb boundaries .",
    "we find similar scaling for volume splitting , and roughly similar for uniform splitting dynamics ; our derivation below suggests that this scaling is generic for our rotational diffusion mechanism .",
    "hence our model will not provide an explanation for the @xmath75 seen for the gnbs .",
    "= 2.5truein 0.1truein = 2.5truein    since the gnbs are in practice distinguished from the idbs by the number of perpendicular cell walls impinging upon them ( each gnb has typically a couple of idbs ) , we tested whether separating our cell boundaries into previously - split gnb analogs and unsplit idb analogs might lead the misorientations of the former to grow more quickly on average with external strain .",
    "this did not occur in our model : both previously split and unsplit cell walls scale in mean misorientation with the square root of the external strain .",
    "we can derive a simple differential equation of the time evolution of the distribution of misorientation matrices across incidental boundaries @xmath76 .",
    "since new cell boundaries are created at zero angle , the equation will be a diffusion equation with a source term : @xmath77 where the gradients on the right are with respect to @xmath20 , and @xmath78 is a three - dimensional dirac delta function ( infinite at zero , zero elsewhere , integral equal to one ) .",
    "the misorientation matrices diffuse with coefficient @xmath79 because the two cells on either side are each diffusing with diffusion coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadeps ] ) represents the diffusion , or random walk , in rotation space .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadeps ] ) represents the creation of new cell boundaries which divide the old ones .",
    "because we choose to weight our misorientation angle density according to the boundary area , this division does not change the cell boundary density @xmath80 except at @xmath81 .",
    "the new boundary area shows up in our distribution at zero misorientation angle @xmath78 . to derive the amount of new boundary area which is created per unit strain",
    ", we use a simple scaling argument .",
    "note that the cell sizes scale as @xmath82 . the total boundary area @xmath83 will scale as the number of boundaries @xmath84 times the area per boundary @xmath85 , hence as @xmath86 .",
    "the new boundary area needed per unit increment of @xmath6 thus scales as @xmath87 , giving the prefactor for the @xmath88-function in equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadeps ] ) .",
    "we now specialize to @xmath37 corresponding to area splitting .",
    "if we start with no cell boundaries at @xmath89 , then the solution to equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadeps ] ) is @xmath90 ( the cell boundaries which are formed at deformation @xmath91 have spread out into a gaussian of variance @xmath92 ) the total boundary area @xmath93 , as desired .",
    "this leads to a prediction for the probability distribution of misorientation angles that yields the scaling collapse ( [ eqn : scalingangle ] ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( as we will discuss in the appendix [ sec : connection ] , this happens to be the distribution as derived by pantleon@xcite in a model without cell refinement . ) as shown on the right in figure  ( [ fig : misorientations ] ) , this scaling form describes the simulation well : the simple scaling argument for the source term of new boundaries ( above ) captured the behavior of the stochastic simulation .",
    "one can see from figure [ fig : experimentvstheory ] that the predicted form is also quite a good description of the experimental data .",
    "this particular functional form is derived using @xmath97 , but the particular exponent is not crucial to the analysis : the solution for @xmath98 has this general form ( with linear slope at @xmath71 and @xmath99 ) for other @xmath44 as well .",
    "-0.15truein = 9.cm",
    "we believe our simple model is the explanation for the observed scaling seen in cell refinement during plastic flow , despite many missing features that are clearly relevant to the experimental behavior .",
    "in particular , we would claim that any physical system that refines by subdivision , and that undergoes random rotational distortions , is likely to enter a scaling regime similar to that seen in our model . in this section ,",
    "we discuss three of the missing features and why they must be relevant for a complete engineering description .",
    "( 1 )  * idb / gnb distinction . *",
    "the experiments show two distinct types of cell boundaries , with different scaling exponents and scaling functions .",
    "our model only includes one .",
    "while we get a plausible fit to the idb scaling , the gnb misorientation angles grow faster than our rotational diffusion model can reproduce .",
    "one must note that scaling behavior in other contexts is associated with a single characteristic length scale : our model asymptotes to a morphology which is statistically unchanging at large strains except for a single rescaling of length . because the experiments show two length scales",
    ", we expect that detailed measurements will show violations of scaling behavior , say , when the mean gnb separation length crosses the idb separation length .",
    "perhaps the fact that the two types of boundaries are roughly evolving on perpendicular axes allows for the approximate scaling seen .",
    "( 2 )  * plastic deformation . * in our simple model",
    ", the overall plastic deformation was ignored . in a real material under compression",
    "the boundaries perpendicular to the strain axis will grow closer to one another linearly in the strain even without subdivision !",
    "apparently@xcite under the external strain the gnb s slowly rotate towards this axis , while the idb s remain roughly aligned parallel to the axis of compression . the external strain , after this rotation is complete , will act to separate the idb s roughly as the square root of the strain @xmath74 . to get the observed refinement @xmath45 the subdivisions must happen even faster than described by the area splitting law we focused on in the text : perimeter splitting , which in the undeformed coordinates leads to a length which scales as @xmath100 would work .",
    "this begs the question of why the scaling should begin to be observed even before the rotations are complete .",
    "pantleon@xcite suggests that this might be an explanation for the observed @xmath101 scaling of the separation between gnbs . at short times , before the rotation is complete , the lengths vary as @xmath45 , and at long times ( with the added effects of compression ) they will vary faster , perhaps leading to a reasonable fit with the larger exponent .",
    "( 3 )  * origins of the cell splitting , rotational diffusion . * in our model ,",
    "the cell splitting and rotational diffusion are given as part of the dynamics : we do not address what the physical mechanisms are that produce them .",
    "there are various proposed mechanisms for getting the cell sizes to shrink .",
    "obviously the cell walls can not just move inward : the cell wall velocities would grow linearly in the system size .",
    "one could imagine a crinkling of existing cell walls ( the inverse of the coarsening process seen in spinodal decomposition ) , or nucleating new cells at junctions of existing cell walls : neither picture is compatible with our analysis , and both involve cell wall motion which is resisted by pinned sessile dislocation junctions@xcite .",
    "subdivision as we ve used it could arise from collisions between dislocations as they traverse the cell , although simple calculations suggest that the expected collision rates are too small@xcite and do nt scale correctly for our theory@xcite .",
    "cell splitting due to inhomogeneous stresses induced by neighboring cells@xcite seem to us the most natural and likely mechanism .",
    "a corresponding microscopic picture would involve regions in the inhomogeneously stressed cell where the dislocations slow down , or where they are more easily pinned by obstacles or other dislocations , leading to the formation of a new cell wall .",
    "the mechanisms driving the rotations of the crystalline axes of the cells are less well understood .",
    "the crystalline axes can rotate both directly through the rotation of the material in the cell , and indirectly because of the flux of dislocations mediated by the plastic deformation .",
    "this latter effect is well studied on larger scales in the field of texture evolution , where the plastic deformation of a polycrystal often leads to a gradual alignment of their crystalline orientations . within a single crystalline grain ,",
    "this texture evolution will on average rotate all the cells together : because the relative angles between cells is small , they will largely rotate in the same direction",
    ". one should note that the traditional explanation for the origin of the gnbs indicates that their misorientation angles could well have a overall mean drift in addition to the random diffusion .",
    "it is said that gnbs are observed to have rotational misorientations that alternate in sign , because they separate regions with differing active slip systems @xcite ; the combination of the differing plastic strains and rotations in neighboring pairs of cells can equal the net imposed plastic deformation . in this picture , the net rotation angles across the gnb s ( equation  [ eqn : orientationaldiffusion ] ) should have a mean drift term in addition to the diffusion term .",

    "we thank paul dawson and ali argon for useful conversations , karin dahmen for help with the manuscript , and wolfgang pantleon and darcy hughes for constructive criticism .",
    "the distribution for the misorientation angle for the simple rotational diffusion model , @xmath102 , happens to have the same form as one derived by pantleon@xcite without considering cell refinement , and by assuming that the noise in the cell orientations was due to random , uncorrelated fluctuations in the dislocation flux .",
    "it behooves us , therefore , to discuss how pantleon s work can be interpreted in our context .",
    "pantleon s theory , also suggested by nabarro@xcite and argon and haasen@xcite , is that the stochastic noise in the flux of dislocation from either side of the cell boundary leads to randomness in the evolution of the cell boundary angles .",
    "each dislocation passing through a cell , say , may shift the top plane of atoms by a distance @xmath103 with respect to the bottom plane , where @xmath103 is the burgers vector of the dislocation ( roughly the lattice constant ) .",
    "the crystalline axes within a cell of characteristic height @xmath42 will rotate due to one dislocation an amount proportional to @xmath104 . under a strain increment @xmath105 , a cell of characteristic height @xmath42 must have @xmath106 dislocations impinging on the side cell boundary .",
    "a roughly equal and opposite average flux will impinge on the cell boundary from the cell on the other side .",
    "if the dislocations move independently ( which we will argue does not occur ) , then one expects that there will be a net residue after the strain increment of roughly @xmath107 .",
    "hence the predicted drift in angle after a strain increment of @xmath105 is @xmath108 .",
    "the diffusion constant is given by @xmath109 . because a single dislocation produces a larger net rotation for smaller cell , the stepsize in the random walk in rotation space becomes larger as our cells get smaller .",
    "pantleon and hansen@xcite consider three cases , where one , two , and three slip systems are activated .",
    "the geometry of a given cell  the direction and strength of the applied shear with respect to the crystalline axes  will determine what types of dislocations are allowed to pass through the cell .",
    "if only one slip system is active , the rotation of the cell will be confined to a single axis . in our formulation ,",
    "the diffusion constant in rotation space will be anisotropic : in this case it will be a rank one tensor ( a @xmath110 matrix with only one non - zero eigenvalue ) .",
    "two slip systems will give a rank 2 tensor , with one zero eigenvalue .",
    "three slip systems will allow the cell to diffuse in any direction , but even so the diffusion constant @xmath24 will in general be anisotropic .",
    "here we have allowed for an anisotropic , cell - size - dependent diffusion constant by introducing the symmetric tensor @xmath112 depending on the current cell size @xmath42 .",
    "the symmetric diffusion tensor @xmath113 will vary with the geometry of the particular cell boundary : it can depend both on the relative orientation of the crystal and the strain tensor with respect to the plane of the cell boundary .",
    "we ll first consider the anisotropy while ignoring the refinement ( @xmath112 independent of @xmath42 ) , in analogy to previous work , and then incorporate the refinement ( @xmath112 proportional to @xmath114 as argued above ) .",

    "pantleon@xcite notices that non - constant cell size must change the scaling of average angle with strain . by setting @xmath117 in accordance with reference @xcite , and changing variables to @xmath118 in equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadepspantleon ] ) , we can map it into a problem quite similar to equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadeps ] ) except that the source term is of magnitude proportional to @xmath119 .",
    "the solution to this equation has a shape quite similar to that shown in figure ( [ fig : experimentvstheory ] ) , but with an average angle @xmath120 .",
    "this yields a @xmath121 power of the strain incompatible with the scaling observed for the incidental cell boundaries .",
    "pantleon is aware of this@xcite : in an analogous calculation he gets @xmath122 .",
    "( if we abandon dislocation noise as the origin of the rotational diffusion , and take the crystalline lattice orientations as our basic variables , then there are no microscopic lengths remaining in the problem .",
    "the diffusion constant then naturally depends only on the local geometry of the cell boundary , and hence is independent of the length scale . )",
    "the key to the discrepancy is of course that the dislocations motion is not uncorrelated : they must be moving in a collective manner .",
    "the interaction energy between dislocations is large , and diverges logarithmically with distance , reflecting the infinite stiffness of a crystal to gradients in the axes of rotation . in early stages of hardening",
    ", one might plausibly argue that the dislocations are sufficiently far apart that their interaction forces do not dominate .",
    "but in the regime studied here , the fact that the dislocations organize into boundaries ( avoiding rotational distortions within the cells ) is a clear signal that it is no longer sensible to treat their evolution independently .",
    "if the top half of a cell boundary received more dislocations from the right - hand cell than the bottom half , this would produce an enormous bending force on the cell .",
    "such an event could only happen for reasonable energy cost if this bending were screened by the division of the cell by a new boundary .",
    "the stochastic dislocation flux models will be generally applicable whenever the correlations between their motions vanish at distances comparable to the cell sizes .",
    "our model is correct in the other limit : our cells only rotate as units .",
    "thus our model is appropriate for systems where the dislocation motions are strongly correlated on the scale of the cells  so that their motion can always be described as mediating overall rotations of each cell .",
    "both descriptions are only a starting point for a complete theory .",
    "consider an analogy : dislocation motion modeled as rearrangements of atoms , versus as the evolution of a continuum curve . in the atomic description",
    ", one would identify characteristic atomic motions ( say , kink diffusion events in the case of semiconductors ) , at rare sites scattered through the crystal .",
    "these sites would be strongly correlated ( lying along the dislocations ) ; their dynamics would produce unusual zipper motions ( kinks diffusing along dislocations ) .",
    "we expect similar correlations to arise in the dislocation motions mediating cell boundary evolution : the dislocations will form correlated dances to keep rotational gradients from entering the cells . on the other hand , treating the dislocation motion as the evolution of a continuous curve makes it difficult to incorporate the anisotropic dynamics and lattice pinning effects  our model so far has ignored the corresponding crystalline and shear anisotropies in the evolution of cell structure .",
    "we can incorporate some of this asymmetry by hand into our model .",
    "pantleon and hansen@xcite point out that the individual cell boundaries have rather low symmetries .",
    "the diffusion tensor in equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadepspantleon ] ) describes the evolution of that subset of cell boundaries with a particular cell boundary orientation and ( average ) crystal lattice orientation with respect to the external shear .",
    "there is no reason that for a low - symmetry geometry that the diffusion constant will be isotropic , geometry dependent , or material dependent : the general evolution law is ( [ eqn : dlambdadepspantleon ] ) with @xmath113 independent of @xmath42 .",
    "one must solve for the distribution at fixed geometry and then average over geometries to predict the experimental distribution ( as also discussed in section 5.2 of reference @xcite ) .",
    "if we assume a strongly anisotropic rotational diffusion tensor with one zero eigenvalue and the other two equal ( corresponding roughly to pantleon s analysis with two active slip systems ) we can solve equation ( [ eqn : dlambdadepspantleon ] ) to find a scaling collapse ( [ eqn : scalingangle ] ) with scaling function @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . this scaling function is shown in figure ( [ fig : experimentvstheory ] ) .",
    "it is important also to note that effects that seem clearly related to cell boundary formation have been seen in finite - element simulations of single - crystal plasticity by mika and dawson _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "their system consisted of several crystalline grains with differing orientations , subject to an external shear .",
    "the inhomogeneous strains within the grains led to the formation of subgrain structures very similar to cells .",
    "the distribution of cell boundaries in their simulation was also found to scale , with strain dependence and functional form similar to that seen for geometrically necessary boundaries ( that is , scaling with the @xmath125 power of strain , and not with the @xmath51 power seen for the idbs ) .",
    "hence dawson _ et al .",
    "_ find cells in a simulation totally without dislocations .",
    "d. p. mika and p. r. dawson , _ acta materialia _ * 47 * , 1355 ( 1999 ) .",
    "n. r. barton and p. r. dawson , `` on the spatial arrangement of lattice orientations in hot rolled multiphase titanium '' , to be published .",
    "f. prinz and a. s. argon , _ physica status solidi _ * 57 * , 741 , ( 1980 ) .",
    "they discuss not collisions between dislocations on different slip systems , but mutual trapping of dislocations with opposite burgers vector on one slip system : our analysis still applies .",
    "one should note that argon now believes that cell boundaries may move during plastic deformation through avalanches of failures of these sessile dislocation junctions ."
