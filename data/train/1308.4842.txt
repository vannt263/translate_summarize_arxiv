    "( 2003 ) have introduced a pair of parameters @xmath201 , called statefinder parameters . in fact , trajectories in the @xmath201 plane corresponding to different cosmological models demonstrate qualitatively different behavior .",
    "the statefinder parameters can effectively differentiate between different form of dark energy and provide simple diagnosis regarding whether a particular model fits into the basic observational data .",
    "the above statefinder diagnostic pair has the following form :    @xmath202    to differentiate among different form of dark energy . here",
    "@xmath44 is the hubble parameter and @xmath113 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "the two parameters @xmath201 are dimensionless and are geometrical since they are derived from the cosmic scale factor @xmath203 alone , though one can reproduce them in terms of the parameters of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "this pair provides information about dark energy in a model@xmath55independent way , that is , it categorizes dark energy in the context of back - ground geometry only which is not dependent on theory of gravity .",
    "hence , geometrical variables are universal . + for our model , the parameters @xmath201 can be explicitly written in terms of @xmath14 as @xmath204 @xmath205}.\\ ] ] from eqs .",

    "in this paper , we have presented a new class of models of accelerating universe and transit universe with gravitational coupling @xmath7 and cosmological term @xmath8 in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the models represent expanding , shearing and non - rotating universe .",

    "there is a point type singularity ( maccallum 1971 ) at @xmath127 in the models .",
    "the rate of expansion slows down and finally tends to zero at @xmath140 . the pressure , energy density and cosmological term @xmath9 become negligible whereas the scale factors , gravitational constant @xmath10 and spatial volume become infinite as @xmath128 .",
    "the nature of decaying vacuum energy density @xmath8 in our derived models is supported by recent cosmological observations .",

    "( [ eq34 ] ) , we find @xmath210 which is used by pradhan and amirhashchi ( 2011 ) in studying the accelerating dark energy models in bianchi type - v space - time and pradhan et al .",

    "( [ eq34 ] ) , we find @xmath212 which is utilized by amirhashchi et al .",
    "( 2011b ) in studying interacting two - fluid scenario for dark energy in frw universe . if we set @xmath213 in eq .",
    "( [ eq34 ] ) , we find @xmath214 which is exercised by pradhan et al .",

    "it is observed that such models are also in good harmony with current observations .",
    "the present work generalizes the the recent works ( pradhan et al .",
    "2013c , e ) .",
    "+ we observe that our models approach to @xmath9cdm model .",
    "so , from the statefinder parameter @xmath201 the behaviour of different stages of the evolution of the universe has been generated . + in summary ,",
