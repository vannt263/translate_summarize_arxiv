    "the experimental ratio of the branching fractions for the two decays was well reproduced with the results obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was found that the coupling of @xmath7 to @xmath4 was essential to obtain agreement with experiment , and if the relative sign of the couplings was reversed there was a cancellation of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 components that makes the @xmath15 partial decay width extremely small , in shear disagreement with experiment .",

    "the coupling with @xmath30 to give a meson - baryon system must include the @xmath26 quark to allow it to go back to the ground level , where it will be in the meson - baryon configuration .",

    "they were taken into account in the study of the @xmath6 decays in ref.@xcite and we make use of the results here .",
    "it was found there that after taking into account the hadronization , including a singlet of su(3 ) @xmath30 states @xmath32 , the following hadronic configuration appeared at the end , ignoring the larger mass @xmath33 component , @xmath34 similarly , the same combination of @xmath4 would appear , and the dynamics of the production of these two cases was explicitly studied in ref.@xcite .",

    "we divert from the formalism of ref.@xcite at this point , but recall from there that in the semileptonic processes the @xmath48 invariant mass is quite large , peaking around the end of the spectrum , which makes the @xmath49 come out with relatively small momentum , and , sharing this momentum with the @xmath50 quarks , the @xmath26 quark carries a small momentum at the end compared to its mass . using the nonrelativistic expressions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 and neglecting terms that go like @xmath53 , we find that only the @xmath54 , and the @xmath55 components survive in this case .",

    "the agreement obtained is not trivial and essentially tied to the @xmath4 component of the @xmath133 resonance .",
    "should there be no coupling to @xmath4 , we would have obtained a ratio for eq.([eq : gammavsgamma ] ) of the order of @xmath134 , clearly in contradiction with experiment , even within the large errors . on the other hand , should the relative sign between @xmath135 and @xmath136 be the opposite , we would have obtained a ratio for eq.([eq : gammavsgamma ] ) of @xmath137 in shear contradiction with experiment .    the reactions studied and their ratio of widths give support to the molecular picture of the @xmath7 and @xmath13 as dynamically generated from @xmath138 and other coupled channels , described in ref.@xcite , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 as the more important components .",
    "together with the results obtained in ref.@xcite for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 , they provide a boost to this molecular picture",
    ". it would be good to have evaluations of these ratios with different pictures , as well as have more experiments with the production of these resonances which can be contrasted with the different pictures .",
    "we have studied the @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions from the perspective that the two @xmath2 resonances are dynamically generated from the @xmath138 interaction with coupled channels .",
    "we work out microscopically the weak vertices , involving @xmath126 and @xmath139 , to have a @xmath138 baryonic final state , which couples to @xmath2 . for this , a @xmath30 pair with the quantum numbers of the vacuum is created and the @xmath140 combine to give either the @xmath141 or @xmath142 . with the help of racah algebra , one can work out the weight for the formation of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 components .",
    "this , together with the coupling of @xmath138 to the two @xmath2 states , gives finally the amplitudes for the @xmath143 transitions . with the input for the @xmath138 couplings to @xmath2 obtained in ref.@xcite we can evaluate the rates for these transitions , up to a common factor involving radial matrix elements of the @xmath62 and @xmath26 wave functions",
    "we do not evaluate this matrix element , which involves an excited @xmath26 quark state in @xmath28 , but calculate the ratio of partial decay widths , where this factor cancels .",
    "we obtain results which are in agreement with experiment , within errors , and note that the agreement is obtained thanks to the coupling of the @xmath7 to the @xmath4 component , which was neglected in early studies of this resonance .",
    "this agreement adds to the one found before for the @xmath6 reactions .",
    "one should note that the ratio found for these latter branching fractions ( @xmath7 versus @xmath13 ) was about @xmath144 , while the one for the semileptonic reactions has been found of the order of @xmath145 .",
    "the experimental data also follow this trend , the ratio for @xmath146 secays is of the order of @xmath147 , while the one of the semileptonic decays is about @xmath148 .",
    "the relative weight of these ratios for the central values is very similar in the theory and the experiment .",
    "the results obtained with these reactions give support to the molecular picture for these two @xmath2 resonances .",
