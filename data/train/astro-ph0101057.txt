    "we estimate that the uncertainty in the bepposax fluxes is @xmath1640% , primarily due to uncertainties in instrumental calibration at large off - axis angles .",
    "examination of table  [ tab : var ] shows that m33  x-4 , x-6 ( @xmath7 only ) , x-7 , x-9 and x-10 ( rosat only ) show @xmath2840% variability with respect to both the @xmath7 and rosat measurements .",
    "the source m33  x-7 shows the strongest evidence for variability being a factor @xmath163 fainter during the bepposax observations than previously observed . since this source exhibits 0.33  day duration",
    "eclipses , we verified that the observations were not at the expected times of eclipse using the ephemeris of larson & schulman ( @xcite ) .",
    "source x-9 , not resolved in the mecs image , appears to be variable being a factor @xmath162.5 brighter during the bepposax observation than previously , if the rosat fluxes of the three separate sources are summed together ( the x-9(c ) flux is not reported in long et al .",
    "@xcite , although it is visible in their figure and appears to be as bright as the other two sources ) .",
    "since the level of variability of m33  x-4 , x-6 , and x-10 is comparable with the ( hard to quantify ) systematic uncertainties , we regard the detection of variability for these sources as tentative .    since m33  x-4 may be associated with a snr , it is interesting to compare  fluxes with those obtained using @xmath7 and rosat using a bremsstrahlung model . if @xmath106 is again fixed at @xmath105  atom  @xmath93 , we obtain kt=2.4  kev for the mecs spectrum and 0.12.4  kev and 0.24.5  kev luminosities of 1.1@xmath107  ergs  s@xmath9 and 1.5@xmath107  ergs  s@xmath9 , respectively .",

    "such unstable behavior is difficult to reconcile with the preferred model for the modulations in the high - mass sources which is obscuration by a precessing accretion disk ( see e.g. , priedhorsky & holt @xcite ) .",
    "since the detection of changes in the properties of these long term variations requires very long observing baselines , it is possible that such unstable behavior is relatively common in accreting systems .",

    "this normalization is in good agreement with the average of a number of low - mass x - ray binary systems known to contain neutron stars ( @xmath167  km ) , but is smaller than the average ( @xmath1625  km ) for black hole candidates ( e.g. , tanaka & lewin ( @xcite ) .",

    "the lack of variability , moderate luminosity ( @xmath112  erg  s@xmath9 ) , and simple ( consistent with a power - law or bremsstrahlung ) spectrum may indicate that m33  x-5 is a young x - ray bright supernova remnant .",
