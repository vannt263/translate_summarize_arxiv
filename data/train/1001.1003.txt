    "the majority of cool stars , including our sun , have magnetically confined atmospheres .",
    "the study of the magnetic activity is important for understanding : 1 ) the dynamo effect , responsible for generating solar and stellar magnetic fields , and 2 ) the different states of stellar evolution and the influence of the magnetic field during these stages of evolution .",
    "the development of the zeeman doppler imaging technique , described in a series of five papers , is a benchmark in the stellar spectropolarimetry domain and , consequently , in the study of magnetic stars by observational methods .",
    "it opened a new window in the research of magnetic activity in cool stars through the measurement of the circular polarization directly from the spectra .",
    "the circular and also the linear polarized signals are detectable through a combination of the doppler and zeeman effects @xcite .",
    "few years after the development of the zdi technique , semel & li ( 1996 ) proposed the line addition principle to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and make possible the detection of extremely faint polarization signals in stars .",
    "since then , the addition principle has been used in different and more sophisticated techniques , and it has been particularly successful with the least squares deconvolution ( lsd ) technique @xcite , to construct mean intensity and/or polarization profiles .",
    "these mean profiles serves in a secondary step as input for codes that produce magnetic stellar surface maps .",
    "observations at different phases of star s rotational period are required to produce these maps @xcite .    the simplest way to employ",
    "the line addition principle is to average the spectral lines .",
    "however , this brut line addition technique is not currently used to retrieve the magnetic field vector , not even for solar observations , where the inversion of the stokes parameters in individual spectral lines is a commonly employed technique .",
    "semel et al . (",
    "2009 ) have recently shown that the signal obtained from the average of multiple spectral lines , the so - called pseudo line , can be employed to estimate the longitudinal magnetic field using the center of gravity method ( e.g. rees et al . 1979 ) .    in this work we present , in sect .",
    "2 , more accurate inversion methods applied to the multi line approach by means of the construction and inversion of the pseudo line , and we extend the study to the linear states of polarization since considering the stokes parameters ( q , u ) is necessary to fully determine the orientation of the magnetic field .    the second part of this work , sect .",
    "3 , is dedicated to another approach of detection of magnetic fields in stars , where all the lines contained in a given spectral range contribute to the final stokes profiles .",
    "we first present the basis of the so - called pca - zdi technique .",
    "we then describe the procedure to obtain the final stokes profiles named multi - zeeman - signatures .",
    "we then apply the developed technique to observed spectra of three cool stars . finally , using synthetic spectra",
    ", we will show that the stellar magnetic fields can be correctly retrieved performing direct inversions of the multi - zeeman - signature profiles .",

    "in this sect . we concentrate on the line addition technique using the simplest way of combine multiple spectral lines that is averaging them .",

    "as mentioned in paper i , we will assume that there is only one magnetic field vector on the stellar surface responsible of the polarized signals and that the total radiation comes from this magnetic .",
    "we do not ignore that more sophisticated scenarios can be considered , but we are not interested in simulate a real stellar spectra but in show that the capabilities of the pseudo line to retrieve the magnetic field vector .    in fig .",

    "note for instance the variety of shape in the i and q profiles .",
    "the relatively reduced number of individual lines used to construct the pseudo line is a first step for a future generalization where much more lines can be included .    before to continue with the inspection of the pseudo line we present the procedure that we follow to express the spectral lines in function of the doppler coordinates .",

    "we explore the use of accurate inversions methods to apply to the pseudo line , i.e. inversions techniques based on the radiative transfer equation ( rte ) .    from experience in the solar data analysis , we know that some correlation between the atmospheric parameters can generate ambiguities in the determination of the magnetic field when the noise level is close to the polarized signal levels , ( e.g. del toro iniesta & ruiz cobos 1996 ; bellot rubio & collados 2003 ; mart ' inez gonzlez et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) . for simplicity",
    ", we initially avoid any possible model parametric degeneration by assuming that the atmospheric model is known and only the magnetic field vector is unknown . with this premise , we test the inference of the magnetic field through the inversion of the pseudo profiles under an ideal scenario where all the variables in the rte are related to the magnetic field vector : the field strength ( b ) , the azimuthal angle ( @xmath26 ) and the inclination field ( @xmath27 ) . the atmospheric model we chose to compute the stokes profiles is as follows : we fixed the gradient of the source function ( @xmath28 ) , the doppler width to 50 m , the ratio of the line to continuum absorption ( @xmath29 ) is twice the relative strength of the components of the iron multiplet and the damping parameter value is fixed to 0.01 .",
    "the four stokes parameters for all the individual fe lines are computed considering the same atmospheric model and the values of the magnetic field varies randomly in the following ranges : b=[0,10 ] kg , @xmath26=[0,180 ] degrees and @xmath30 $ ] degrees .",
    "consider now a given combination of the magnetic field parameters , @xmath31=(@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) . from the synthesis of the fe lines for this combination of parameters ,",
    "we then obtain the respective pseudo line for this @xmath31 model .",
    "note that we are in this way _ associating _ a magnetic model to the pseudo line .",
    "the exercises consist to determine the magnetic field supposed punctual and fixed in a known position in the stellar surface .",
    "the inversions in each fe line and in the pseudo line have been done separately and the goal is to compare the results .",
    "we have developed one inversion code per fe line and one for the pseudo line .",
    "the code s functionality is : first , we construct a representative synthetic database of a large number of profiles ( 56600 ) .",
    "then , given a stokes vector to invert , we find the best - fit solution from the database using the same algorithm as described in ram ' irez vlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we inverted a set of 500 profiles for each of the lines listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] . to compute the sets of profiles to invert",
    ", we followed the same procedure as when constructing the database profiles : we have fixed the atmospheric model and we consider random magnetic field vectors .    while inverting the set of stokes profiles , we applied and compared different strategies to recover the magnetic field vector . initially , we considered the four stokes parameters ( i , q , u , v ) to simultaneously retrieve the solution of the three magnetic parameters ( @xmath35 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "we then inverted the same set of profiles using only the i and v stokes profiles , which is the most common case for stellar observations .",
    "finally , we performed the inversions using only the two linear stokes parameters ( q and u ) .",
    "the goal of performing different inversion strategies is twofold . on one hand",
    ", we compare the degree of accuracy of the inversions using the four stokes parameters to the most typical case in the data analysis that is when we only dispose of the intensity and circular polarization spectra .",
    "on the other hand , this procedure permits to improve the precision of the inversions .",
    "let us call the _ discerning criteria _ as the use of different stokes parameters to retrieve the different components of the magnetic field .",
    "given that the inversion code works finding as solution the best - fit of the profiles in the databases , the employment of the _ discerning criteria _ has the advantage that the databases become largers and thus , the code reduce the error of the inversions .",
    "we remark however that the results of the analysis of the pseudo line do not depend in the proposed criteria described below , such that some readers may want to skip the next subsection .",
    "to clarify the idea of the extension of the database , let @xmath36 denote the stokes vector for a given set of parameters such that @xmath37 and @xmath31=(@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "let ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) denote the associated solution values found with the inversion performed using the i and v stokes parameters .",
    "now , let @xmath40 be the solution value after inversion of the q and u stokes parameters of the same @xmath36 .",
    "since the values of the parameters were retrieved independently , then @xmath41 ( in more than 90% of the cases ) .",
    "finally , we use the so - called _ discerned criteria _ to construct the final solution with a parameters combination @xmath42=(@xmath38 , @xmath40 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "since @xmath42 was not originally in the database , we are `` extending '' the database through the use of the discerning criteria .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : disc ] , using a set of 500 profiles without any added noise , we show the inversion results following the described criteria .",
    "the graphics correspond to the inversions of the fe i line at 6141  , the first line listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .    while using only the i and v stokes profiles to perform the inversions , first column in fig .",
    "[ fig : disc ] , more refined inversions are obtained for @xmath35 and @xmath27 that when all the stokes parameters are included in the inversions ( third column ) .",
    "this is explained because the number of magnetic models whom parameters @xmath35 and @xmath27 are close to the original pair of value parameters ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) get increased when the @xmath26 is ignored .    in the second column",
    "we present the results of the inversions using only the linear stokes profiles ( q , u ) . in this case",
    ", also an improvement happens for the inversions of the parameter @xmath26 compared to the inversions of the third column when the four stokes parameters are considered . from the comparison of the inversions , showed in the forth column ,",
    "we then conclude that the discerning criteria improves the inversion results : in the case of the field strength , the dispersions in the errors diminished considerable and the maximum error value decreased from @xmath46140 g ( symbols in gray ) to @xmath4725 g ( symbols in black ) . in the case of the geometrical parameters , the angles @xmath27 and @xmath26 , the inversions also improve with the adopted criteria .    note",
    "that it is expected that the proposed discerning criteria increase the inversion precision only for those codes that employs a big set of profiles ( databases ) where the solution is found .",
    "one advantage of the developed inversion codes is the estimation of the typical errors .",
    "thus , in order to compare quantitatively the inversions retrieved from each line , the results are presented in terms of the absolute value of the difference between the original and the inferred parameters :    @xmath48 , 1x10@xmath49 and 1x10@xmath50 of the continuum level ( @xmath51 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : histos ] we show the percentage histograms of the inversion s errors for all the fe lines ( in gray ) and for the pseudo line ( in black ) .    in the case without any added noise , we can see that all the inverted parameters are well retrieved .",
    "the histograms of the errors have a sharp peak at 0 and drop quickly .",
    "note for instance that the field strength is inferred with an error smaller than 10 g with a high probability .",
    "the small errors for all the parameters are mainly due to the finiteness of the database , and are identified as the precision errors of the database . in any case , note that the results with the pseudo line are the very same the ones obtained from the inversions of individual spectral lines .",
    "we then conclude that the pseudo line encodes the information of the magnetic field vector as the individual spectral lines do!.    in the lowest noise case ( @xmath52 ) , all parameters are also correctly retrieved , the errors being very close to the precision of the database . however , when increasing the noise levels to @xmath53 and to @xmath54 , the error bars become more important , making the error distributions slightly wider .",
    "we remark that for these noisy cases the pseudo line is the one that gives the best results , corroborating that the addition of multiple lines increases the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "we continue our inspection of the pseudo line relaxing the constraint that the magnetic field is the only free variable .",
    "we have thus included some line formation parameters in the atmospheric model , to verify that in a more general case the goodness of the approach remains .",
    "considering as free variables the doppler width ( @xmath55 ) , the absorption line ratio ( @xmath56 ) , the source function gradient ( @xmath57 ) and , the magnetic field vector , we have repeated the same exercise as before inverting a set of 500 pseudo profiles .",
    "the construction of the pseudo line follows the same principle as before : given a combination of the atmospheric parameters ( excepting @xmath56 ) those values are used to compute all the fe lines , and subsequently , obtain the pseudo line . in the case of the @xmath56 parameter , a factor ( denoted @xmath58 )",
    "modifies in the same amount any of the @xmath56 values , preserving the relative intensities ( i.e. for all fe lines , @xmath56 = @xmath59 ) .    in fig .",
    "4 , we show the obtained results .",
    "after inversion of the 500 pseudo profiles , we have found that the retrieved values in any of the parameter are correct ( with of course and associated error ) .",
    "we then conclude that the atmospheric model and the magnetic field can both be deduced from the inversions of the pseudo line .",
    "we argue in favour of the results , that the method used to invert the pseudo line is the very same the one used for the construction . with the present results , we then conclude that the multi line approach based in the direct addition of many spectral lines , i.e. in the construction of the pseudo line , is a very useful tool in the study of solar and stellar magnetic fields .",
    "alternatively to the method presented in the last sect . , instead of make more efforts in this direction considering as many lines as possible in the pseudo line , we prefer to employ a more sophisticated approach recently proposed by semel et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , hereafter referred as paper ii . in this sect .",
    "we focus in this second approach named pca - zdi .",
    "the principal idea of the pca - zdi technique is to incorporate the computation of the radiative transfer equations , for instance using an atmospheric model in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , in combination with a powerful statistical tool , the principal components analysis ( pca ) , in order to retrieve reliable detections of the stellar magnetic fields .",
    "this is in fact a way to overcome the employment of the weak field approximation used originally in the formulation of the zdi technique ( semel 1989 ) and preserved in the lsd technique @xcite .",
    "as will be shown , the pca - zdi technique is a powerful method for detection of magnetic fields in stars . in a summarized description of the developed technique , firstly is required to dispose of a representative database composed of stellar spectra .",
    "in fact , despite the domain of application , the construction of the database is a key step when is intended to perform analysis by principal components @xcite . in any case , once defined the database , of what ever number of spectra is constructed this one , it is decomposed in a new basis using the single value algorithm @xcite .",
    "the new basis is spanned in terms of eigenvectors which present many interesting properties . for the purposes of this work , we employ the eigenvectors of the new basis as _",
    "detectors _ to retrieve from the spectra the magnetic _ signature _ of the stokes parameters .",
    "we have denominated these magnetic signatures as _ multi - zeeman - signature _ ( mzs ) .",
    "the pca - zdi technique will thus retrieve a not null mzs profile in the polarized stokes parameters whenever is present a magnetic field in the stellar atmosphere and the signal to noise ratio allows it .    from an observational point of view",
    ", the main constrain to retrieve the polarized stokes parameters in individual spectral lines is the very faint levels expected in the signals      based in the ideas proposed in the first paper of zdi @xcite , we have considered that there is only one magnetic element in the stellar surface , at the projected position ( @xmath60 ) , and we have calculated the local stokes profiles at this position . from the results already obtained with synthetic and observed spectra , we advance that the employment of the local profiles does not limit the detection in stars with complex magnetic fields configurations -dipolar , multi - polar and/or multispot- .",
    "a more detailed inspection of this statement will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the stellar spectra in the four stokes parameters have been established with the help of cossam , described in stift ( 2000 ) and in wade et al .",
    "cossam is an lte line synthesis code in polarised light that calculates the stokes profiles over arbitrarily large wavelength intervals , both for the sun and for dipolar field geometries in magnetic stars .",
    "direct opacity sampling is carried out over the @xmath61 , the @xmath62 , and the @xmath63 components separately of the ( anomalous ) zeeman patterns of the individual lines .    while covering different positions in the stellar surface and at each one considering different field strengths and orientations",
    "is possible to obtain a representative combination of synthetic spectra which will serve to construct the database .",
    "the position of the stellar element is specified through the @xmath60=cos(@xmath64 ) , where @xmath64 is the angle between the line - of - sight direction and the normal to surface element .",
    "@xmath60 varies from [ 0.2 , 1 ] with a step size of 0.2 . at each @xmath60 position ,",
    "we have spanned the magnetic field strength b=[0,250, ... ,3000 ] g and the inclination angle @xmath27=[0,15, ... ,90 ] @xmath65 . for economy in cpu - time we have fixed the azimuthal angle ( @xmath26 ) , but note that this fact does not limit the detection in the linear stokes parameters since applying rotations of the reference frame to the calculated spectra is possible to pass from the stokes q to the stokes u , or to obtain any desired configuration in the linear parameters , ( e.g. sect . 6.4 in del",
    "toro iniesta 2003 ) .",
    "consequently is justified to consider as the general case the approach used in the @xmath26 parameter . in this way , the combination of parameters produces a database ( @xmath66 ) with 425 spectra , per stokes parameter .",

    "[ fig : exa_ev ] , we show a small portion of the first three eigenvectors of the database constructed for t=4750 @xmath65 k.      one of the reasons why we employ pca is because of its capability of data compression and space dimensions reduction .",
    "we mean that in eq .",
    "( [ equ : pca2 ] ) the equality is reached only when @xmath82 = 424 , but in practice @xmath82 could be dramatically reduced such that only the first components are considered .",

    "[ fig : comps ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : comps ] , we can appreciate that rate of contribution of the components to the original spectra decreases faster than an exponential , permitting to truncate the expansion in eq .",

    "we have followed a typical approach with pca . in the following",
    "we employ the eigenvectors as magnetic detectors such that combining them with the zdi principles , the magnetic signature from the spectra will be extracted .",
    "another of the advantages of the employment of pca apart from the data compression , is that it permits to retrieve a set of coefficients \\{@xmath84 } associated univocally to each one of the spectra @xmath79 .",

( [ equ : alfas ] ) represents the fundamental principle that will be employed to extract the magnetic signature from the observed spectra ( @xmath86 ) . in order to do it ,",
    "the last step of the procedure is to consider the rotation velocity of the star and the associated doppler effect , i.e. combine the mzs profiles with the zdi principles .",

    "we then add the contribution from these components to find the final expression that will be employed to retrieve the multi - zeeman - signature :    @xmath101    considering the absolute value of the eigenvectors and following the procedure of the last equation , in fig .",
    "[ fig : detec ] , we show two examples of the mzs profiles obtained in intensity and in circular polarization of two cool stars .",
    "the binary system hd 155555 , left panels , was observed in april 2007 with the anglo australian telescope , at the aao observatory , using the sempol polarimeter . the solar type star hd 190771 , right panels ,",
    "was observed in august 2007 with the bernard lyot telescope , at the pic du midi observatory , using the narval polarimeter .",
    "the detection of magnetic fields in this three stars have been also found through the lsd method .",
    "in fact , the mzs profiles from fig . [",
    "fig : detec ] seems similars in shape to those retrieved with the lsd method ( dunstone et al .",
    "2008 , petit et al .",
    "nevertheless a proper comparison has not been done to distinguish possible differences in the profiles and how important could be those differences when retrieving the magnetic field . in any case , for the moment , the pca - zdi technique has been applied with success to retrieve mostly the circular states of polarization in cool stars ( ram ' irez vlez et al .",
    "in fact this is in part due to the absence of representative samples of linear data to analyse , so we leave for a future work studies where the linear states of polarization can be incorporated in the detection and measurement of stellar magnetic fields .      in this section",
    "we intend to show that it is possible to infer the magnetic field through the inversion of the mzs profiles .",
    "we will place a simplistic scenario where again we consider local stokes profiles from different surface elements .",
    "we further assume that there is a punctual magnetic field in the surface elements . from now on , the mzs to which we refer will be obtained from the local stokes profiles through eq .",
    "( 13 ) . given a mzs ,",
    "the inversion exercise consist in find the position of the surface element and the magnetic field vector .",
    "the local stokes profiles are calculated for a small spectral range [ 5400,5500 ]  .",
    "the parameters of the stokes profiles , and thus those of the mzs , varies randomly in the following ranges : the magnetic field strength [ 0,10 ] kg , the inclination field [ 0,90]@xmath65 , the magnetic azimuthal angle [ 0,180]@xmath65 and the projected position of the surface element ( @xmath60 ) [ 0,1 ] .",
    "since the inversions are performed in the space of the mzs we have produced 6000 mzs that serves as database where we tested the inversion of a set of 600 mzs .    as mentioned",
    "previously there are two alternatives to produce mzs , namely , whether or not is considered the the absolute value of the eigenvectors ( eqs . 10 and 11 ) .",
    "we will test both alternatives and we will show that whether or not is included the absolute value , the inversions are correct .",
    "we first present the case where the absolute value of the eigenvectors is employed to retrieve the mzs . in upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : examp ] we show an example of a synthetic mzs ( in black color ) and the respective mzs solution ( in gray color ) .",
    "the inversion is correct not only because the similarity between the mzss but because the values of the parameters solution are close the originals ones ( see the title in each panel ) .",
    "moreover , given that any mzs is associated to a stellar spectrum , in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : examp ] we corroborate that , as expected , the stokes profiles associated to the mzs solution fit enough well the originals ones .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : examp2 ] we show the mzs associated to the same combination of parameters as before but for the case where the absolute value is not considered .",
    "the solution parameters in this case are also close to the original ones ( upper panels ) and the associated solution stokes profiles gives a good fit to the original stokes profiles ( lower panels ) .    finally , we present the results of the inversions of the 600 mzs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : inv_psp ] , the upper panels correspond the case when the absolute value of the eigenvectors is included to produce the mzs and the lower panels correspond to the case when is not included .",
    "these results show that in both cases , the magnetic field vector is correctly retrieved despite the position in the stellar surface , for all strength fields and orientations .",
    "the final conclusion in this section is that the multi - zeeman - signature represents not only an effective tool for the detection of stellar magnetic fields , but also that inversions in the space of the multi - zeeman - signatures can be directly performed .",
    "in this article , we have focused in the multi line analysis of spectropolarimetric data , with emphasis in the detection and inference of stellar magnetic fields .",
    "the use of multiple lines is required to increase the signal to noise ratio in those cases where the polarized signals in individual spectral lines are significantly inferiors to the noise level , remaining hidden for analysis purposes .",
    "this is typically the case , for instance , in observations of cool stars .    to deal with this observational constraint ,",
    "we have presented the development of two new approaches that serve both of them to extract a polarized signal from a mixture of several individual spectral lines . while employing any of the proposed multi - line techniques , namely the pseudo line or the pca - zdi approach , we remark three main advantages : ( 1 ) the contributions of all the spectral lines to the final polarization signal",
    "are included -despite the similarity or not in the individual shape profiles- , ( 2 ) it is a valid method for the detection of the circular and the linear states of polarization and ( 3 ) it is not limited to weak or to strong magnetic field regimes .      initially , considering an ideal scenario where the magnetic field is the only free variable of the atmospheric model",
    ", we have found that the results obtained from the inversions of the pseudo line are as goods as those obtained from individual spectral lines .",
    "we have also shown that it is expected that in the case of real observed spectra ( with a given noise level ) , the best results in any of the magnetic components are retrieved with the inversions of the pseudo line .",
    "finally , we have showed that the atmospheric model , in addition to the magnetic field , can also be inferred through the inversions of the pseudo line .    in the case of the multi - zeeman - signatures , we discussed in detail the development of the technique , and we applied it to real observed data in order to illustrate the type of profile obtained with the pca - zdi technique .",
    "the circular polarized mzs profiles , like those in fig .",
    "[ fig : detec ] where the polarized signal level is clearly superior to the noise level , represent in a unambiguously way a detection of the magnetic field present in the stellar object .    by construction ,",
    "the multi - zeeman - signatures contain the information of the magnetic field and atmospheric model . to verify this ,",
    "we have performed inversions in a synthetic set of mzs profiles .",
    "the results obtained after the inversions show that the all the considered parameters in the atmospheric model are correctly retrieved .",
    "it is pertinent to mention that some refinements have to be done to the technique in order to achieve magnetic fields measurements through the inversion of the mzs profiles .",
    "in particular , the doppler broadening effect due to the rotation of the stars and the case of inversions of continuum fields distributions over the stellar surface will be presented in forthcoming papers . for the moment",
    ", we have settled the basis of the approach founding that pca - zdi is a robust technique for the analysis of stellar magnetic magnetic fields .",
    "the final conclusion of this work is that when the inversion of the magnetic polarized signal are done through the same method used to construct them , the physical parameters that determine the line formation process can be properly recovered , included in particular , but only , the stellar magnetic field ."
