    "the dissipation of kinetic energy in collisions and tidal encounters and the formation of more massive objects through mergers tend to accelerate core collapse . on the other hand , mass loss from evolving collision products",
    "can provide indirect heating of the cluster core , thereby slowing down core collapse .",
    "in addition , in globular clusters , stellar collisions are thought to produce a variety of interesting observable objects at rates far exceeding those in the rest of the galaxy .",

    "interactions involving main - sequence ( ms ) stars are thought to be related to the _ blue straggler _ phenomenon .",
    "blue stragglers are objects that appear as ms stars above the turnoff point in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of a star cluster .",
    "all observations suggest that they are indeed massive ms stars formed through the merger of two ( or more ) lower - mass stars .",
    "in particular , saffer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and sepinsky et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have directly measured the masses of several blue stragglers in the cores of 47 tuc and ngc 6397 and confirmed that they are well above the ms turnoff mass ( see also the article by saffer in this volume ) .",
    "gilliland et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have demonstrated that the masses estimated from the pulsation frequencies of four oscillating blue stragglers in 47 tuc are consistent with their positions in the cmd .",
    "mergers of ms stars can occur in at least two different ways : following the physical collision of two single stars , or through the coalescence of the two components in a close binary system ( bailyn 1995 ; leonard 1989 ; livio 1993 ) .",
    "direct evidence for binary progenitors has been found in the form of contact ( w  uma type ) binaries among blue stragglers in low - density globular clusters such as ngc 5466 ( mateo et al .",
    "1990 ) and m71 ( yan & mateo 1994 ) , as well as in many open clusters ( see ahumada & lapasset 1995 for a recent survey ) .",
    "at the same time , strong indication for a collisional origin comes from detections by hst of large numbers of blue stragglers concentrated in the cores of some of the densest clusters , such as m15 ( de marchi & paresce 1994 ; guhathakurta et al .",
    "1996 ) , m30 ( yanny et al .  1994 ; guhathakurta et al .",
    "1998 ) , ngc 6624 ( sosin & king 1995 ) , and m80 ( ferraro et al .  1999 ) .",
    "collisions can happen directly between two single stars only in the cores of the densest clusters , but , even in moderately dense clusters , they can also happen indirectly , during resonant interactions involving primordial binaries ( bacon et al .  1996 ; cheung et al .",
    "2000 ; davies & benz 1995 ; sigurdsson et al.1994 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) .",
    "observational evidence for the existence of dynamically significant numbers of primordial binaries in globular clusters is well established ( ct et al .",
    "1994 ; hut et al .",
    "1992 ; rubenstein & bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "dynamical interactions between hard primordial binaries and other single stars or binaries are thought to be the primary mechanism for supporting a globular cluster against core collapse ( gao et al .",
    "1991 ; goodman & hut 1989 ; rasio 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , exchange interactions between primordial binaries and compact objects can explain very naturally the formation in globular cluster cores of large numbers of x - ray binaries and recycled pulsars ( see , e.g. , rasio , pfahl , & rappaport 2000 and references therein ) .    in all clusters ,",
    "dynamical interactions between primordial binaries can result in dramatically increased collision rates .",
    "this is because the interactions are often resonant , with all four stars involved remaining together in a small volume for a long time ( @xmath0 orbital times ) .",
    "for example , in the case of an interaction between two typical hard binaries with semi - major axes @xmath1au containing @xmath2 ms stars , the effective cross section for collision between any two of the four stars involved is essentially equal to the entire geometric cross section of the binaries ( bacon et al.1996 ; cheung et al .  2000 ) .",
    "this implies a collision rate @xmath3 times larger than what would be predicted for single stars .",
    "collisions involving more than two stars can be quite common during binary  binary interactions , since the product of a first collision between two stars expands adiabatically following shock heating , and therefore has a larger cross section for subsequent collisions with one of the other two stars ( cheung et al .  2000 ) .",
    "these multiple collisions provide a natural explanation for the existence of blue stragglers that may have masses above _",
    "twice _ the turnoff mass ( saffer , in this volume ; sepinsky et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "benz & hills ( 1987 ; 1992 ) performed the first 3d calculations of direct collisions between two ms stars , using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method .",
    "an important conclusion of their pioneering study was that stellar collisions could lead to thorough mixing of the fluid . in particular , they pointed out that the mixing of fresh hydrogen fuel into the core of the merger remnant could reset the nuclear clock of a blue straggler , allowing it to remain visible for a full ms lifetime @xmath4yr after its formation . in subsequent work",
    "it was generally assumed that the merger remnants resulting from stellar collisions were nearly homogeneous .",
    "blue stragglers would then start their life close to the zero - age ms , although with an anomalously high helium abundance coming from the hydrogen burning in the parent stars . in contrast , little hydrodynamic mixing was expected to occur during the much gentler process of binary coalescence , which could take place on a stellar evolution timescale rather than on a dynamical timescale ( bailyn 1992 ; mateo et al .",
    "1990 ) .    on the basis of these ideas ,",
    "bailyn ( 1992 ) suggested a way of distinguishing observationally between the two possible formation processes .",
    "blue stragglers made from collisions would have a higher helium abundance in their outer layers than those made from binary mergers , and this would generally make them appear somewhat brighter and bluer .",
    "a detailed analysis was carried out by bailyn & pinsonneault ( 1995 ) , who performed the first stellar evolution calculations for blue stragglers assuming various initial chemical composition profiles . to represent the collisional case ,",
    "chemically homogeneous initial profiles with enhanced helium abundances were assumed .",
    "for the dense cluster 47  tuc , the observed luminosity function and numbers of blue stragglers appeared to be consistent with a collisional origin .",
    "lombardi , rasio , & shapiro ( 1995 , 1996 ) later re - examined the question of hydrodynamic mixing during stellar collisions , using higher - resolution sph calculations .",
    "they found that , in contrast to previous results , hydrodynamic mixing during collisions may be very inefficient , and typical merger remnants produced by collisions could be far from chemically homogeneous . in the case of collisions between two nearly identical stars ,",
    "the final chemical composition profile is in fact very close to the initial profile of the parent stars ( lombardi , rasio , & shapiro 1995 ; rasio 1996a ) . for two turnoff stars ,",
    "this means that the core of the merger remnant is mostly helium .",
    "prompted by these results , sills , bailyn & demarque ( 1995 ) started investigating the possible consequences of blue stragglers being born unmixed . using stellar structure calculations , they compared the predicted colors and luminosities of initially unmixed models with observations of the six very bright blue stragglers in the core of ngc 6397 .",
    "they concluded that some of these blue stragglers have observed colors that can not be explained using unmixed initial models ( cf .",
    "ouellette & pritchet 1998 ) .",
    "initially homogeneous models , however , could reproduce all the observations .",
    "in addition , unmixed models have very short ms lifetimes and may be generally incompatible with the observed numbers of blue stragglers in dense cluster cores .",
    "the key to resolving this apparent inconsistency may be stellar rotation , which can both provide more mixing and increase the stellar evolution lifetime of collision products ( sills et al .",
    "2000 ; sills , in this volume ) .",
    "our most recent hydrodynamic calculations ( sills & lombardi 1997 ; sills et al .",
    "2000 ) improve on previous studies ( benz & hills 1987 , 1992 ; lombardi et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ; sandquist et al .",
    "1997 ) by adopting more realistic initial stellar models and by performing numerical calculations with increased spatial resolution .",
    "the latest version of our sph code has been fully parallelized and allows calculations to be performed with @xmath5 sph particles , compared to the @xmath6 used in previous studies .",
    "all spurious transport processes affecting sph calculations can be reduced significantly by increasing the number of sph particles ( lombardi et al .",
    "for the first time in a study of stellar collisions , accurate initial stellar models have been calculated using a state - of - the - art stellar evolution code ( the yrec code developed at yale by demarque and collaborators ; see guenther et al .",
    "1992 and sills et al .",
    "this allows us , in particular , to study chemical mixing and stellar evolution of collision products in a completely self - consistent way .",
    "the importance of using realistic initial models ( rather than simple polytropes , which were used in all previous studies ) in stellar collision calculations was demonstrated by sills & lombardi ( 1997 ) . in some cases , results based on calculations for polytropes",
    "can actually lead to _ qualitatively incorrect _ conclusions about the structure of the merger remnant .",
    "the vast majority of 3d numerical studies of stellar collisions have used the sph method ( see , e.g. , monaghan 1992 and rasio & lombardi 1999 for recent reviews ) . indeed , because of its lagrangian nature , sph presents some clear advantages over more traditional grid - based methods for calculations of stellar interactions .",
    "most importantly , fluid advection , even for stars with a sharply defined surface , is accomplished without difficulty in sph , since the particles simply follow their trajectories in the flow .",
    "in contrast , to track accurately the orbital motion of two stars across a large 3d grid can be quite tricky , and the stellar surfaces then require a special treatment ( to avoid `` bleeding '' ) .",
    "a lagrangian scheme is also ideal for following hydrodynamic mixing , since the chemical composition attached to each particle is simply advected with that particle .",
    "this is a key advantage for the problems discussed here , where the chemical composition profiles of merger remnants must be determined accurately .",
    "sph is also very computationally efficient , since it concentrates the numerical elements ( particles ) where the fluid is at all times , not wasting any resources on emty regions of space . for this reason , with given computational resources",
    ", sph can provide higher averaged spatial resolution than grid - based calculations , although godunov - type schemes such as ppm typically provide better resolution of shock fronts .",
    "sph also makes it easy to track the hydrodynamic ejection of matter to large distances from the central dense regions .",
    "this is a key advantage for calculating processes such as collisions , where ejection of significant amounts of matter through rotational instabilities or gas shocking plays an important role .",
    "sophisticated nested - grid algorithms and more expensive calculations are necessary to accomplish the same with grid - based methods .",
    "spurious transport by sph particles can render completely unphysical the results of low - resolution hydrodynamics calculations .",
    "for example , particle shear viscosity can lead to the artificial generation of vorticity . the strong differential rotation observed in collision products",
    "could also be damped rapidly , leading to spurious transport of angular momentum away from the central region .",
    "in addition , numerical viscosity can also lead to spurious entropy production and this contributes systematic errors in all thermodynamic properties of the fluid . when studying chemical mixing during mergers , it is particularly important to calibrate how much of the observed mixing is real , and how much results from spurious diffusion of sph particles . based on a very extensive study with test calculations ( lombardi et al .",
    "1999 ) , we are confident that , with @xmath7 sph particles , and with the latest improvements to our code ( see lombardi et al .  1999 for details ) , spurious transport processes can be brought down to an acceptable level .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations are of course limited to following the evolution of mergers on a dynamical timescale ( @xmath8hours for ms stars ) but are not capable of following processes taking place on a thermal timescale ( @xmath9yr for ms stars ) .",
    "the final configurations obtained at the end of hydrodynamic calculations are very close to _ hydrostatic equilibrium _ , but are generally far from _",
    "thermal equilibrium_. therefore , the merger remnant will need to contract ( on its kelvin time @xmath10 ) before it can be treated as a star again .",
    "this thermal relaxation of an object initially far from equilibrium can not be calculated with most standard stellar evolution codes , which assume small departures from thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , to compute theoretically the subsequent stellar evolution of the object , and to make comparisons with observations , it is necessary to perform detailed calculations of this thermal relaxation phase , taking into account processes that are not always incorporated into existing stellar evolution codes .",
    "as the object evolves towards thermal equilibrium , many processes can lead to additional mixing of the fluid .",
    "in particular , thermal convection , which is well known to occur during the evolution of ordinary pre - ms stars , could produce significant mixing in blue stragglers ( see leonard & livio 1995 ) . even if ordinary convection does not occur , local thermal instabilities such as semi - convection and thermohaline - type instabilities ( spruit 1992 ) can develop , leading to mixing on the local radiative damping timescale . indeed , some of our previous hydrodynamic calculations ( lombardi et al .",
    "1996 ) suggest that many merger remnants , although convectively stable , have temperature and chemical composition profiles with large thermally unstable regions . for",
    "the rapidly ( and differentially ) rotating products of grazing collisions , meridional circulation , as well as various rotationally - induced instabilities ( see , e.g. , tassoul 1978 ) , can lead not only to mixing , but also to angular momentum transport and mass loss .",
    "loss of angular momentum through magnetic braking or coupling of the star to an outer disk of ejected material could also play an important role in spinning down the merger remnant .    for each final configuration obtained with our sph code ,",
    "we calculate the thermal relaxation of the remnant using a modified version of the yale stellar evolution code ( yrec , see sills at al .",
    "2000 and sills , in this volume ) , which follows the evolution of a rotating star both on a thermal timescale and on a nuclear timescale ( sills 1998 ) .",
    "yrec evolves a star through a sequence of models of increasing age , solving the linearized stellar evolution equations for interior profiles such as chemical composition , pressure , temperature , density and luminosity .",
    "all relevant nuclear reactions ( including pp - chains , the cno cycle , triple-@xmath11 reactions and light element reactions ) are treated .",
    "recent opacity tables are used ( ensuring that the remnant s position in a cmd can be accurately determined ) .",
    "yrec incorporates standard treatments of convection , semi - convection and rotationally - induced mixing and angular momentum transport through processes such as dynamical and secular shear instabilities , meridional circulation , and the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability ( see guenther et al .",
    "1992 for details ) .",
    "the free parameters in the code ( the mixing length and parameters that set the efficiency of angular momentum transport and rotational chemical mixing ) are set by calibrating a solar mass and solar metallicity model to the sun . for blue stragglers , the various transport processes can potentially carry fresh hydrogen fuel into the stellar core and thereby extend the ms lifetime of the remnant . furthermore , any helium mixed into the outer layers affect the opacity and hence the remnant s position in a cmd .",
    "this treatment , combining hydrodynamics and stellar evolution , attempts to provide a complete , self - consistent description of blue straggler formation and evolution , assuming a collisional origin .",
    "our first results demonstrating the feasibility of this basic approach have been presented in sills et al .",
    "( 2000 ; see also sills , in this volume ) .",
    "these results , although encouraging , have revealed a number of important theoretical problems that will have to be addressed carefully in future work .",
    "most importantly , we find that even slightly off - axis collisions produce merger remnants that can be rotating near break - up .",
    "as they contract to the ms , these objects must lose some mass and a large amount of angular momentum .",
    "the most likely angular momentum loss mechanism , which we plan to study in detail , is magnetic coupling to an outer disk ( containing the material ejected during the initial collision ) .",
    "ordinary magnetic braking ( as in pre - ms stars ) is not likely to be important since , at least based on the calculations we performed so far , typical merger remnants never develop outer convective envelopes .",
    "our most recent hydrodynamic calculations have been done using a new , parallel version of the sph code developed originally by rasio ( 1991 ) specifically for the study of hydrodynamic stellar interactions ( see , e.g. , faber & rasio 2000 ; lai et al .",

    "the gravitational field in our code is calculated on a 3d grid using an fft - based convolution algorithm .",
    "the density field is placed on a 3d grid by a cloud - in - cell method , and convolved with a kernel function calculated once during the initialization of the simulation .",
    "we use zero - padding of our grids to obtain correct boundary conditions for an isolated system , at the expense of memory storage .",
    "gravitational forces are calculated from the gravitational potential by finite differencing on the grid , and then interpolated for each particle using the same cloud - in - cell assignment . for most problems , the cpu time is dominated by the calculation of the gravitational field .",
    "the current implementation is based on the high - performance fftw parallel routines ( frigo & johnson 1997 ) .",

    "the entropic variable @xmath24 is a measure of the fluid s compressibility and is closely related ( but not equal ) to specific entropy : for example , both @xmath24 and specific entropy are conserved in the absence of shocks . for convenience , we refer to @xmath24 simply as `` entropy . '' in this paper we adopt an equation of state appropriate for a monatomic ideal gas : the adiabatic index @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the density and pressure of particle @xmath18 .",

    "the artificial viscosity ( av ) term @xmath33 ensures that correct jump conditions are satisfied across ( smoothed ) shock fronts , while the rest of equation  ( [ fsph ] ) represents one of many possible sph - estimators for the acceleration due to the local pressure gradient ( see , e.g. , monaghan 1985 ) .",
    "the rate of increase , due to shocks , for the entropy @xmath22 of particle @xmath18 is given by @xmath34 we adopt the form of av proposed by balsara ( 1995 ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 the terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , respectively , the average smoothing length and sound speed associated with particles @xmath18 and @xmath39 . here",

    "for the two collisions presented sills & lombardi 1997 , the realistic parent star models were created using yrec .",

    "our models also reproduce the chemical profiles of the sph remnant very well : the peak values in the chemical abundances are accurate to within roughly ten percent , and the shapes of these profiles , though sometimes peculiar , are followed closely .",

    "specific angular momentum profiles , averaged over surfaces of constant density , are compared in figure [ jreal2.3 ] for cases e , f and k. note that the hump in the sph @xmath39 profile in the outer few percent of the remnant is due to having to terminate the simulation before all of the gravitationally bound fluid has fallen back to the merger remnants : this feature is still diminishing gradually during the final stage of the sph calculation and hence we do not attempt to model it .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is very little lithium in our remnants .",
    "lithium is burned during stellar evolution except at very low temperatures ( @xmath91 k ) , and therefore can be used as an indicator of mixing .",

    "a small amount of lithium in our @xmath92 parent star does exist in the outer few percent of its mass and consequently becomes part of the ejecta during the collision .",
    "although near the remnant s surface our method yields a large _ fractional _ error in lithium abundance ( see fig .",
    "[ chem8a ] ) , this is simply because the overall abundance is so close to zero .",
    "for example , the predicted surface fractional li@xmath93 abundance of @xmath94 for our case  a remnant is an overestimate , but is roughly 30 times smaller than the surface fractional abundance in the @xmath92 parent . except for in the extreme case of grazing collisions ( in which mass loss would be exceedingly small ) , collisional blue stragglers",
    "should be severely depleted in lithium , a prediction that can be tested with appropriate observations ( see shetrone & sandquist 2000 for a recent attempt at detecting lithium in blue stragglers ) .    since our method takes considerably less than a minute to generate a model on a typical workstation , versus hundreds or thousands of hours for a hydrodynamic simulation to run on a supercomputer , we are able to explore the results of collisions in a drastically shorter amount of time .",
    "our approach is easily generalized to work for more than two parent stars , by colliding two stars first and then colliding the remnant with a third parent star .",
    "such algorithms will make it possible to incorporate the effects of collisions in simulations of globular clusters as a whole .",
