    "localized ` particle - like ' solutions play an important role in non - linear field theories . in flat space ,",
    "solutions of particular interest are skyrmions ( in the strong interaction ) @xcite , electroweak sphalerons @xcite , or magnetic monopoles @xcite .    in the case of pure yang - mills theory , or of pure einstein gravity , in contrast , there are no regular ` particle - like ' solutions @xcite .",
    "but when yang - mills theory and einstein gravity are combined , static , gobally regular ` particle - like ' solutions appear @xcite .",
    "the spatial symmetries of static classical solutions can be specified by means of certain rational maps of degree @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "maps of degree @xmath3 and @xmath4 lead to classical solutions with spherical symmetry and axial symmetry , respectively , while for maps with degree @xmath5 , solutions with only discrete symmetries appear . identifying these with the symmetries of platonic solids or crystals",
    ", we refer to them as platonic solutions .    in flat space",
    "platonic solutions , such as platonic skyrmions , platonic monopoles and platonic sphalerons , are known @xcite .",
    "but does gravity also allow for the existence of regular solutions with only discrete symmetries , and does it even allow for platonic solutions , which do not possess a flat space limit ?    to answer these questions , we would like to construct platonic generalizations of the famous static , spherically symmetric bartnik - mckinnon ( bm ) solutions @xcite , representing globally regular solutions of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory with action @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the scalar curvature , @xmath8 $ ] the su(2 ) field strength tensor , @xmath9 the gauge potential , and newton s constant @xmath10 .    for static solutions , the 4-dimensional metric ( @xmath11 )",
    "can be reduced according to @xmath12 yielding the 3-dimensional action @xmath13 with @xmath14 .    while we expect a 3-dimensional metric @xmath15 with distinct metric functions @xmath16 for exact platonic solutions , we here consider only approximate platonic eym solutions , obtained with a euclidian 3-dimensional metric . for static configurations , in this approximation",
    "the action then agrees with the action of yang - mills - dilaton ( ymd ) theory , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the dilaton field , and the solutions therefore represent platonic solutions of ymd theory .",
    "indeed , the dilaton may be considered as a kind of scalar graviton , possessing also a universal coupling to matter .",
    "consequently , solutions of eym and ymd theory are expected to possess very similar properties .",
    "this is indeed the case for spherically symmetric and axially symmetric solutions @xcite .",
    "the study of platonic ymd solutions is therefore expected to yield important information about platonic eym solutions , without having to solve the highly complicated set of coupled einstein - yang - mills equations .",
    "spherically and axially symmetric eym and ymd solutions form sequences , labelled by two discrete numbers , representing the degree of the map @xmath2 , and the node number @xmath19 of the gauge field functions @xcite .",
    "we expect analogous sequences of platonic solutions , i.e. , for a given map of degree @xmath2 , there should be a fundamental platonic solution and an infinite sequence of excited platonic solutions with the same symmetries .",
    "first indications of the existence of these solutions have been seen recently in yang - mills - higgs - dilaton ( ymhd ) theory @xcite    here we construct such platonic ymd solutions .",
    "we consider the anstze for these solutions in section 2 , we discuss their properties and present the numerical results in section 3 , and we give the conclusions and an outlook in section 4 .",
    "to obtain ymd solutions with discrete symmetry we make use of rational maps , i.e.  holomorphic functions from @xmath20 @xcite . treating each @xmath21 as a riemann sphere ,",
    "the first having coordinate @xmath22 , a rational map of degree @xmath2 is a function @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are polynomials of degree at most @xmath2 , where at least one of @xmath25 and @xmath26 must have degree precisely @xmath2 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 must have no common factors @xcite .",
    "we recall that via stereographic projection , the complex coordinate @xmath22 on a sphere can be identified with conventional polar coordinates by @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "thus the point @xmath22 corresponds to the unit vector @xmath28 and the value of the rational map @xmath29 is associated with the unit vector @xmath30    we here consider platonic ymd solutions obtained from the map @xmath31 , @xmath32 this rational map leads to the unit vector ( [ unit2 ] ) @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "for static solutions with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the general set of field equations then involves the dilaton function @xmath39 , and nine functions for the gauge field , @xmath40 .",
    "the solutions are characterized by the rational map of degree @xmath2 , and , for a given map , numbered with increasing excitation by the integer @xmath19 , where the fundamental solution has @xmath41 .    to obtain solutions with finite energy , we demand that the gauge field of the fundamental solution ( and for odd @xmath19 solutions in general ) tends to a pure gauge at infinity , @xmath42 with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 in contrast , the gauge field of the first excited solution ( and for even @xmath19 solutions in general ) should vanish at infinity .",
    "we also require that the dilaton field vanishes at infinity , @xmath45 , since any finite value of the dilaton field at infinity can always be transformed to zero via @xmath46 , when the radial coordinate is transformed according to @xmath47 .",
    "the boundary conditions for platonic solutions are , in principle , only needed at infinity .",
    "specifying the unit vector @xmath48 thus completely determines the boundary conditions for the gauge field of the fundamental @xmath0 platonic solution with cubic symmetry ( [ bca ] ) .",
    "the gauge field then exhibits at infinity the angle - dependence of the rational map , since @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast , for the first excited @xmath0 platonic solution the discrete symmetry does not enter via the boundary conditions at infinity , since the gauge field vanishes there .",
    "parametrizing the gauge potential @xmath50 in terms of polar components , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , we obtain a smooth numerical solution for the first excited platonic @xmath0 ymd solution . for the corresponding fundamental ymd solution , however , this parametrization does not lead to an everywhere smooth numerical solution ( with the same numerical method @xcite ) .",
    "the polar gauge field functions of the fundamental solution exhibit a discontinuity at infinity , which we relate to the fact that the polar gauge field functions of the fundamental solution are angle - dependent at infinity , whereas those of the first excited solution approach zero at infinity .",
    "assuming that the observed discontinuity is a numerical effect , we expect to be able to avoid it by employing a better suited parametrization for the gauge field .",
    "in particular , the angular dependence of the gauge field at infinity should be contained explicitly in the new parametrization for the fundamental solution @xcite .",
    "to obtain such a parametrization , we note , that at infinity @xmath54 and @xmath55 approach @xmath56 respectively , since @xmath57 we therefore choose @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 as a basis of the lie algebra of su(2 ) .",
    "this is adequate , as long as @xmath61 and @xmath62 do not vanish .",
    "since for the rational map @xmath31 , the vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 vanish along the cartesian coordinate axes , problems may arise in the numerical proceduce , unless boundary conditions are specified here .",
    "thus we demand that the gauge field vanishes along the coordinate axes .",
    "accordingly , we employ the following parametrization for the gauge field of the fundamental solution , @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 the functions @xmath68 now have no angular dependence at infinity . in particular , @xmath69 and @xmath70 approach unity at infinity , while the other seven functions vanish there .",
    "subject to the boundary conditions and to the gauge condition @xmath71 the set of field equations can be solved numerically .",
    "the discrete symmetries of the platonic solution allow for a restriction of the region of numerical integration . specifying the reflection symmetries of the fields with respect to the @xmath72- , @xmath73- and @xmath74-plane",
    ", it is sufficient to solve the field equations for @xmath75 and @xmath76 and @xmath77 only @xcite .",
    "the integration region can even be restricted to @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with the reflection symmetries of the fields at @xmath80 .",
    "the boundary conditions at infinity must now be supplemented by conditions at the other boundaries of the integration region .",
    "these boundaries consist of the origin , parts of the @xmath72- , @xmath73- and @xmath74-plane ( or the plane @xmath80 ) , and the positive @xmath81-axis .",
    "( together with the boundary at infinity these boundaries are implemented numerically as the boundaries of a cube @xcite . )",
    "the gauge field vanishes at the origin , and the dilaton field satisfies @xmath82 .",
    "the boundary conditions in the @xmath73-plane ( @xmath83 ) , the @xmath74-plane ( @xmath84 ) , in the plane @xmath85 , on the @xmath81-axis ( @xmath86 ) and in the @xmath72-plane ( @xmath87 ) follow from the reflection symmetries of the fields .",
    "in particular , we suppose that the rational map @xmath31 determines the reflection symmetries of the fields .",
    "thus we impose , that for the platonic ymd solutions the gauge field @xmath88 possess the same reflection symmetries as @xmath89 $ ] . for the gauge field functions @xmath50 and @xmath68 , the proper set of boundary conditions is given in table 1 .",
    "for the dilaton field the normal derivative must vanish in the @xmath72- , @xmath73- and @xmath74-plane , in the plane @xmath80 , and on the @xmath81-axis ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "( @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) & @xmath80 + 1 &    .",
    "the boundary conditions in the @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath72-plane , on the @xmath81-axis , and for @xmath80 are given for the gauge field components of the fundamental ( @xmath41 ) and first excited ( @xmath95 ) platonic solution . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     * table 2 * + the energy @xmath96 of eym solutions and ymd solutions with spherical symmetry ( @xmath3 ) and axial symmetry ( @xmath97 ) and node numbers @xmath98 .",
    "for comparison , the energy @xmath99 of the limiting solutions of the sequences is also shown .",
    "note , that @xmath100 decreases with @xmath2 for fixed finite @xmath19 .    in the limit @xmath101",
    ", the sequences of solutions corresponding to a certain map of degree @xmath2 tend to limiting solutions . for the eym sequence",
    ", the limiting solution corresponds to the exterior of an extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solution with mass @xmath102 , and magnetic charge @xmath103 . in isotropic coordinates , the horizon of the extremal rn is located at @xmath104 , and its metric reads @xmath105 this metric is of the type of the metric eq .",
    "( [ metric1 ] ) with @xmath106 and a euclidian 3-dimensional metric .",
    "not surprisingly , for the ymd sequence the limiting solution has dilaton field @xcite @xmath107 clearly representing the same extremal rn solution .",
    "thus with increasing excitation eym and ymd solutions differ less and less , and converge to the same limiting solution . considering a ymd solution as an approximation to an eym solution",
    ", the approximation thus improves with increasing @xmath19 for fixed @xmath2 .",
    "surfaces of constant total energy density @xmath108 ( left column ) and of constant energy density of the gauge field @xmath109 ( right column ) are shown for the fundamental cubic ymd solution ( upper row ) and for the first excitation ( lower row ) .",
    "let us now turn to the platonic ymd solutions . in fig .",
    "1 we present surfaces of constant total energy density @xmath108 and of constant energy density of the gauge field @xmath110 for the fundamental and first excited cubic solutions .",
    "the energy density clearly reflects the symmetries of a cube . as before @xcite",
    "we conclude that the shape of the energy density of platonic solutions is determined primarily by the rational map , since we observe the same shape for the ymd solutions as for skyrmions , sphalerons , and monopoles , based on the same map @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the energy density of the excited solution exhibits a cubic shape both for large and for small constant values , revealing a small interior cube within a larger exterior cube .",
    "the energy of the fundamental cubic solution is @xmath111 , while the energy of the first excited cubic solution is @xmath112 , with estimated errors on the order of @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "comparison of these values with those of the axially symmetric @xmath0 solutions ( table 2 ) reveals , that the platonic solutions have lower energy . for the cubic eym solutions we conjecture that they possess a slightly higher mass , in accordance with the known rotationally symmetric solutions .",
    "the observed values @xmath115 and @xmath116 are in agreement with the conjecture , that the energy of the excited cubic solutions tends to the limiting value @xmath117 for @xmath118 .    the metric function @xmath119 is exhibited in fig .  2 for the fundamental and the first excited solution",
    ". clearly , the metric exhibits the same platonic symmetry as the energy density .",
    "surfaces of constant metric function @xmath119 for the fundamental cubic ymd solution ( left column ) and the first excitation ( right column ) .    in fig .  3 we further address the conjecture , that platonic solutions associated with maps of degree @xmath2 form infinite sequences , tending to extremal rn solutions with magnetic charge @xmath103 .",
    "the cubic solutions should therefore tend to a limiting extremal rn solution with charge @xmath1 .",
    "we first consider convergence of the dilaton function @xmath120 to the limiting function @xmath121 , eq .",
    "( [ rel2 ] ) .",
    "therefore we extract a ` local magnetic charge ' @xmath122 for the fundamental ( @xmath41 ) and first excited ( @xmath95 ) solution , by defining @xmath123 exhibiting @xmath122 as a function of @xmath124 for three fixed angles , we observe indeed that the functions @xmath122 approach the constant @xmath125 with increasing @xmath19 in an increasing interval .",
    "we then extract a ` local magnetic charge ' @xmath126 from the metric component @xmath127 of a non - extremal rn solution of mass @xmath96 in isotropic coordinates @xcite , employing eq .",
    "( [ metric1 ] ) @xmath128 again we observe , that the charge @xmath129 obtained from the first excited solution is closer to the constant value @xmath125 of the limiting extremal rn solution in a wider range than the charge @xmath130 of the fundamental solution , indicating that with increasing @xmath19 the platonic solutions indeed tend to the spherically symmetric extremal rn solution with @xmath1 .",
    "motivated by the aim to demonstrate the existence of non - perturbative gravitating solutions with only discrete symmetries , we have constructed platonic solutions in ymd theory .",
    "these solutions may be viewed as exact ( numerical ) solutions of scalar gravity , by considering the dilaton as a kind of scalar graviton , or as approximate solutions of einstein - yang - mills theory , when the spatial part of the metric is taken to be euclidian .",
    "we have focussed on platonic solutions with cubic symmetry , related to a certain rational map of degree @xmath0 . by constructing numerically the fundamental cubic solution and its first excitation , we have here presented the first two solutions of the cubic @xmath0 sequence .",
    "we conjecture , that the sequence converges to the extremal reissner - nordstrm solution with magnetic charge @xmath1 .    by including the dilaton to approximate the effects of gravity ,",
    "we have obtained evidence for the existence of platonic eym solutions , while avoiding the complexity of the full set of eym equations in the absence of rotational symmetry .",
    "construction of exact ( numerical ) platonic eym solutions , however , remains a true challenge .",
    "the existence of gravitating regular solutions involving non - abelian fields , is related to the existence of black holes with non - abelian hair @xcite .",
    "thus the existence of gravitating regular solutions with platonic symmetries strongly indicates the existence of a completely new type of black holes : static black holes which possess only discrete symmetries @xcite .",
