    "<S> this is because of the reduced symmetry of the zinc - blend crystal structure compared to group - iv semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> along the [ 001 ] direction , a iii - v semiconductor lattice is stacked alternately with group iii and v atoms ( indium and antimony for insb ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the equivalent plane appears at every two atomic steps on the ( 001 ) surface of such crystal . in the group iv semiconductor crystal , every atomic plane along [ 001 ] is equivalent and appears with 90@xmath19 rotation at each atomic step to form the double - domain surface structure . </S>",
    "<S> the 90@xmath19 rotation at each atomic step also occurs for iii - v semiconductors ; the double atomic step results in a 180@xmath19 rotation , so the steps are actually identical thanks to the two - fold rotation symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the conduction path of the bi / insb(001 ) surface was clearly demonstrated to be parallel to [ 110 ] .    </S>",
