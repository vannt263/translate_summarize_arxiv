    "accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies provide an excellent mean to probe the physics of the early universe , in particular the hypothesis of inflation .",
    "recently , scientists working with the boomerang @xcite and maxima-1 @xcite cmb experiments announced the clear detection of the first acoustic peak at an angular scale @xmath2 , which confirms the most important prediction of inflation : the universe seems to be spatially flat @xcite .    in the framework of inflation",
    "cmb anisotropies follow from the basic principles of general relativity and quantum field theory .",
    "to predict the multipole moments of these cmb anisotropies two ingredients are necessary : the initial spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations and the `` transfer functions '' , which describe the evolution of the spectra since the end of inflation .",
    "the transfer functions depend on cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant ( @xmath3 ) , the total energy density ( @xmath4 ) , the density of baryons ( @xmath5 ) , the density of cold dark matter ( @xmath6 ) and the cosmological constant ( @xmath7 ) .    for the analysis of cmb maps it is a reasonable first step to test the most simple and physical model of the early universe : slow - roll inflation with a single scalar field .",
    "slow - roll inflation predicts a logarithmic dependence of the power spectra on the wave number @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , in most studies of the cmb anisotropy the spectral shape of power - law inflation @xcite , corresponding to an exponential potential for the inflaton field , has been considered .",
    "this case is unphysical , since power - law inflation does never stop .",
    "two of us @xcite have shown , using analytical techniques , that the predictions of power - law and slow - roll inflation can differ significantly . here",
    ", we confirm these results and calculate the cmb anisotropies with a full boltzmann code developed by one of us ( a.  r. ) . the numerical accuracy of this code has been tested by comparison to analytical results ( low @xmath9 ) and to cmbfast v3.2 @xcite . in general both codes",
    "agree within @xmath10 .",
    "we use the new cmb data to test slow - roll inflation , assuming the two most popular versions of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models ( our `` priors '' ) : the standard cdm model ( scdm : @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and the cosmic concordance model ( @xmath13cdm : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , which is motivated by the results of the high-@xmath17 supernovae searches @xcite .",
    "in particular , we take @xmath18 in agreement with the most important prediction of inflation , @xmath19 , which is consistent with supernovae type ia measurements [ @xmath20 at @xmath21 c.l .",
    "@xcite ] , and @xmath22 , as inferred from the observed abundance of d and primordial nucleosynthesis [ @xmath23 @xcite ] .    in this letter",
    "we recall the basic predictions of slow - roll inflation ( sec .  2 ) and correct errors and misconceptions that have been recently made in the literature on this issue ( sec .  3 )",
    ". in section 4",
    "we compare for the first time the predictions of slow - roll inflation with the recent data of boomerang and maxima-1 ( without any elaborated statistical technique ; we remind that only @xmath24 of the boomerang data have been analyzed so far ) .",
    "the power spectra from power - law inflation , for which the scale factor behaves as @xmath25 with @xmath26 , change with a fixed power of the wavenumber @xmath8 . for the bardeen potential and for gravitational waves",
    "the power spectra in the matter - dominated era are respectively given by @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a pivot scale and where @xmath29 .",
    "the factor @xmath30 is predicted from inflation , its expression is given in @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath30 is _ a priori _ free and must be tuned such that the angular spectrum is cobe - normalized .",
    "the choice of @xmath31 fixes @xmath32 and @xmath33 and we always have @xmath34 .",
    "the predictions of power - law inflation are the same for any value of the pivot scale , since @xmath28 can be included into the definition of @xmath30 .",
    "let us now turn to slow - roll inflation which is certainly physically more relevant , since it covers a wide class of inflationary models .",
    "slow - roll is essentially controlled by two parameters : @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the hubble rate .",
    "these two parameters can be related to the shape of the inflaton potential @xcite .",
    "all derivatives of @xmath38 and @xmath39 have to be negligible , e.g.  @xmath40 , only then the slow - roll approximation is valid .",
    "slow - roll inflation corresponds to a regime where @xmath38 and @xmath41 are constant and small in comparison with unity .",
    "the power spectra of the bardeen potential and gravitational waves can be written as @xcite @xmath42 , \\\\",
    "\\label{specsrgw } k^3p_{\\rm h } & = & \\frac{400a}{9 } \\biggl[1 - 2\\epsilon \\biggl(c+1+\\ln \\frac{k}{k_0}\\biggr)\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the euler constant .",
    "slow - roll inflation predicts the value of @xmath30 , which is given in @xcite and has not necessarily the same numerical value as for power - law inflation .",
    "one important difference to power - law inflation is that the choice of the pivot scale @xmath28 now matters .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the slow - roll error in the scalar multipoles is minimized at the multipole index @xmath45 if @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the comoving distance to the last scattering surface and @xmath48 $ ] with @xmath49 . for @xmath50",
    "this gives @xmath51 , where @xmath52 for scdm and @xmath53 for @xmath54cdm .",
    "usually the choice @xmath55 is made , which corresponds to @xmath56 . in this letter",
    "we also consider the case @xmath57 , which roughly corresponds to the location of the first acoustic peak . finally , from eqs .",
    "( [ specsrd ] )  ( [ specsrgw ] ) the spectral indices are inferred @xmath58 an important consequence of these formulas is that the relation @xmath59 does not hold for slow - roll inflation , except in the particular case @xmath60 .",
    "we found five misconceptions in the literature , which do have an important impact on the extraction of cosmological parameters from the measured cmb multipole moments : a- from eqs .",
    "( [ specpls ] ) and ( [ specsrd ] )  ( [ specsrgw ] ) we see that the shapes of the spectra are not the same in power - law inflation and in slow - roll inflation ( even if @xmath60 ) . unfortunately , the unphysical power - law shape ( [ specpls ] ) is assumed frequently , although the relevance of deviations from the power - law shape has been discussed earlier [ see e.g.  @xcite ] .",
    "this difference in the shape affects the estimates of cosmological parameters in @xcite and @xcite , since this misconception is built in into the most commonly used numerical codes : cmbfast and camb @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been demonstrated that the difference is important and increases with @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , with the usual choice @xmath62 , the error is @xmath63 at @xmath64 for @xmath65 , see fig .",
    "[ compsr - pl ] .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite to move the pivot scale to @xmath66 , which decreases the difference from the spectral shapes . for the case",
    "considered before , the difference reduces to @xmath67 with @xmath66 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ compsr - pl ] . for cases @xmath68 the error from the wrong shape increases [ for the primordial spectra",
    "this has been studied by @xcite ] .",
    "thus , for the accurate estimation of the cosmological parameters , one must not mistake power - law inflation for slow - roll inflation .",
    "we suggest to place the scale for which the slow - roll parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are determined in the region of the acoustic peaks , rather than in the cobe region , which decreases the error from the slow - roll approximation and one can get rid of the limitations from cosmic variance for the normalization .",
    "b- in various publications @xcite and codes ( cmbfast and camb ) @xmath69 and @xmath70 are allowed in the data analysis , while working with power - law spectra ( the prediction of power - law inflation ) .",
    "this is meaningless in the context of inflationary perturbations . for the case",
    "@xmath71 the scalar amplitude is divergent and the linear approximation breaks down [ see eq .",
    "( [ specpls ] ) ] . if , nevertheless , the power ",
    "law shape is assumed , @xmath72 should be fulfilled . on the contrary , in slow - roll inflation , as can be checked on eqs .",
    "( [ specindsr ] ) , one can have @xmath73 or @xmath74 , only @xmath75 is compulsory .",
    "c- a third misconception is that gravitational waves are not taken into account properly .",
    "this is an important issue since a non - vanishing contribution of gravitational waves modifies the normalization and changes the height of the first acoustic peak . in @xcite ( see the footnote [ 13 ] ) , it was assumed that if @xmath74 , there are no gravitational waves at all , a supposition in complete contradiction with the predictions of slow - roll inflation .",
    "also , in that article , the relation @xmath76 was used .",
    "it is valid for power - law inflation only . in @xcite",
    "gravitational waves have been neglected , which restricts the analysis for their choice of @xmath71 to the case @xmath77 , such that tensors contribute less than about @xmath78 of the power .",
    "d- by default in the cmbfast and camb codes the contribution of gravitational waves is calculated according to the relation @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite argued , based on this relation , that power - law models with large tilt can not explain the observed anisotropies .",
    "however , this relation is only valid for power - law inflation and the scdm model . in particular",
    "this is no longer true when @xmath80 ( @xmath54cdm model ) .",
    "the reason is the so - called `` late integrated sachs - wolfe effect '' , which has been well known for a long time @xcite .",
    "the normalization must be performed utilizing the power spectra themselves and not the quadrupoles in order not to include an effect of the transfer function . in fig .",
    "[ wrongts ] , we display the @xmath54cdm multipole moments ( for @xmath65 ) in the case where the wrong normalization is used together with the case where the normalization is correctly calculated with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ specsrd ] )  ( [ specsrgw ] ) .",
    "the error is @xmath81 at @xmath64 .",
    "this weakens the mentioned argument of @xcite and in fact questions any analysis that uses the cmbfast default scalar - tensor ratio together with a non - vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "e- finally , cmbfast and the pre - july  2000 versions of camb calculate the low-@xmath9 multipoles in the tensorial sector inaccurately . in the case of power - law inflation and the scdm model",
    "they can be well approximated by @xmath82 with , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a spherical bessel function . for @xmath85 ,",
    "this gives in agreement with @xcite : @xmath86 .",
    "the code developed by one of us ( a.r . ) reproduces this value with a precision better than @xmath87 , whereas cmbfast gives @xmath88 , i.e. an error of @xmath89 . above @xmath90",
    "both codes agree reasonably well .",
    "this problem has been fixed in the july  2000 version of camb .",
    "we now consider the most simple and physical model for inflation ( i.e.  slow - roll inflation optimized with @xmath91 ) for the scdm and @xmath54cdm scenarios and compare its predictions with the observational data of cobe / dmr @xcite , boomerang and maxima-1 .",
    "we demonstrate that a large region of the parameter space @xmath1 [ or equivalently @xmath92 , forbidden in the case of power - law inflation but allowed in the case of slow - roll inflation , contains models which fit the data as good as the models usually considered in the data analysis .",
    "the data are very often presented in terms of band - power @xmath93 , with @xmath94 . for any value of @xmath95 and @xmath39 , @xmath96 can be approximatively expressed in terms of the band - power for @xmath38 , @xmath97 @xmath98.\\ ] ] a corresponding formula for power - law inflation has been presented in @xcite [ see remark before eq .",

    "in the previous equation , we have assumed @xmath103 which is valid only if @xmath104 in order for the tensorial modes to be negligible .",
    "the quantity @xmath105 is defined by @xmath106 and appears because the spectrum is normalized to the multipole @xmath107 . at the leading order",

    "( [ bandpower ] ) permits us to roughly understand how the spectrum is modified when the slow - roll parameters are changed . for fixed @xmath110 ,",
    "i.e.  for a fixed scalar spectral index @xmath32 , increasing @xmath38 , i.e.  increasing the value of @xmath111 , lowers @xmath96 . increasing @xmath112 ( i.e. decreasing @xmath32 ) while @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath33 ) remains constant has the same effect .    in figs .",
    "[ scdm ] ( scdm scenario ) and [ lambdacdm ] ( @xmath54cdm scenario ) , we display the theoretical predictions of slow - roll inflation for some values of the slow - roll parameters . without performing a @xmath113-analysis ,",
    "our main conclusion is that there exist models that reasonably fit available cmb data , which were not included in the estimates of cosmological parameters before , in particular in the data analysis of the recent cmb maps @xcite .",
    "this includes models with @xmath114 and non - negligible gravitational waves contribution .",
    "for instance , the model @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( i.e.  @xmath73 and @xmath117 ) in the @xmath54cdm scenario , see fig .",

    "slow - roll inflation is the best model presently known and is consistent with presently available data .",

    "although very important on the conceptual side , the previous misconceptions were not crucial for the cobe / dmr experiment .",
    "for the next generation of measurements , which aim to extract cosmological parameters with a precision of a few percent , distinguishing power - law inflation from slow - roll inflation becomes mandatory .",
