    "all these latest experimental developments receive their greatest excitement by the announcement of this year 2013 nobel prize of physics being awarded to f. englert and p. w. higgs due to their seminal works @xcite 5 decades ago .",
    "since the new particle decays to pairs of gauge bosons and fermions , a non - integer spin is already ruled out . according to the landau - yang theorem  @xcite ,",
    "given the fact that the new boson decays into pair of photons , it excludes the spin 1 possibility and then the remaining possibility is either 0 or 2 .",
    "recently , spin and parity of the higgs - like particle were studied from the angular distributions of the diphoton , @xmath21 and @xmath22 decay channels @xcite at atlas and cms by looking at the kinematical information of the final states : photons and leptons .",

    "more data is needed in order to fully pin down the exact nature of the newly discovered particle .",
    "the fact that the higgs - like particle couplings to gauge bosons and fermions are consistent with sm prediction can put severe constraints on all models extending the sm that try to accommodate such higgs - like particle .    as we now know",

    "the other related loop induced decay @xmath32 has not been seen yet but is expected to be measured at the future lhc 13 - 14 tev run when more data is accumulated .",
    "any additional charged particles beyond those in the sm will contribute to the loop amplitudes for these two processes .",
    "thus it is important to measure these two modes as accurate as possible .",

    ", we have shown that @xmath151 and @xmath152 are positively correlated with a roughly linear relation between the twos . depending on whether @xmath151 is greater or lesser than 1",
    ", we found that @xmath152 is lesser or greater than @xmath151 respectively , due to the intricate destructive interference between the contribution of the additional charged higgs with the sm @xmath67 inside the loop of the two processes .",
    "while the decay mode @xmath0 has played an important role in the discovery of the sm higgs at the lhc , the mode @xmath42 has yet to be verified .",
    "we expect lhc-14 should be able to detect this latter mode positively and provide useful correlation information among these two modes .",
    "the correlation of these two signal strengths studied in this work for ihdm can then be tested accordingly at the lhc-14 .    due to its clean environment",
    ", ilc has great potential to measure various properties of the sm higgs more precisely .",
    "these include branching ratios , cross sections , cp properties and its mass . in section iv of this paper ,",
    "we have computed the one - loop processes @xmath118 and @xmath3 in the feynman gauge using dimensional regularization for the future ilc machine .",
    "we have shown that the charged higgs loops in ihdm can modify the sm predictions for these processes in a significant way .",
    "for both processes , we have calculated in the ihdm the total as well as the differential cross section for the recently discover higgs at 125 gev .",
    "we also studied the total cross sections for these two processes as a function of the parameter @xmath79 which controls the contribution of the charged higgs boson in the loops .",
    "we find that the cross sections for both processes are quite sensitive to this parameter so that the signal strengths @xmath134 and @xmath153 that we defined for the ilc can be deviated from their sm values of unity .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the correlation of these two signal strengths with @xmath154 .",
    "we found that for the correlation between @xmath134 and @xmath154 can be mainly positively for @xmath126 = 250 gev and either positive or negative correlated for @xmath126 = 500 gev depending on the ihdm parameter space . on the other hand",
    ", for the correlation between @xmath153 and @xmath154 , we found a roughly linear relation between them for both @xmath126 = 200 and 500 gev .",
    "all our predictions for the ihdm in this work can be tested at the ilc .",
