    "it is well known that the only triply periodic minimal surfaces whose complements are given by symmetric and self - dual graphs are the p , d and g surfaces , see e.g. @xcite . while the p and d surfaces were already discovered by schwarz in 1830 @xcite",
    ", it took until 1970 for the g surface to be discovered by alan schoen @xcite . in real situations",
    "these surfaces appear as the boundary between phases .",
    "we will concentrate on the complement of these surfaces which consists of two components or channels . for the p , d and g surfaces these two channels have the same underlying skeletal graph onto which they retract .",
    "this graph carries all the homotopical information , such as the k - theory .",
    "figures [ pgraph ] , [ dgraph ] and [ ggraph ] show one channel and its skeletal graph for the respective cases .",
    "the guiding physical motivation for this study is that , when the boundary has a finite thickness ( as it always does in real materials ) , the complement still forms two channels of a nanoporous structure .",
    "these channels can be filled with a ( semi)conductor , forming a nanowire network of potential interest in applications . indeed , for the g surface , or rather the double gyroid , this has been achieved @xcite .",
    "each channel is composed of approximately cylindrical segments joined together at triple junctions",
    ". numerical simulations of a simple wave equation have shown that the lowest - energy wavefunctions are supported primarily on the junctions .",
    "thus , one may expect to reproduce the low - energy end of the spectrum by using the tight - binding approximation , in which the junctions are replaced by the vertices , and the segments connecting them by the edges , of a graph .",
    "mathematically speaking , this means that each component of the complement of a g surface is indeed contracted onto its graph .    of particular interest",
    "is the behavior of periodic nanoporous materials in an external magnetic field , specifically , the questions of existence and number of any additional gaps in the spectrum the field may produce . such gaps would be a 3-dimensional analog of hofstadter s butterfly @xcite .",
    "note that the materials in question are `` supercrystals , '' whose lattice constants far exceed atomic dimensions .",
    "( for instance , for the double gyroid of @xcite , the lattice constant is of order 20 nm . ) as a result , the magnetic flux through the unit cell may be a sizable fraction of the flux quantum for realistic magnetic fields , opening the possibility of an experimental study of the additional gap structure .",
    "we would like to understand this structure from the point of view of non - commutative geometry , in parallel with the earlier studies of the quantum hall effect @xcite .    in our previous article @xcite",
    ", we gave a general approach for such wire systems treated as graphs with a given translational symmetry group .",
    "the relevant result of this analysis was that for a constant magnetic field the relevant @xmath0 algebra @xmath1 generated by magnetic translation operators and the harper hamiltonian has a faithful matrix representation as a subalgebra of a matrix algebra of a noncommuative torus .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath2 be the dimension of the ambient space , @xmath3 be the number of sites in a primitive cell and @xmath4 be the magnetic field expressed as a 2form .",
    "then @xmath1 embeds into @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the noncommutative n  torus with parameter @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the @xmath9 algebra of @xmath10 matrices with entries in @xmath6 .",
    "one expects that generically , that is if all entries of @xmath7 are irrational , the algebra @xmath1 is the full matrix algebra and thus is morita equivalent to @xmath6 itself . at rational points",
    "there is no such expectation .",
    "an interesting question is to classify the points at which the algebra is a proper subalgebra , as they should have special physical properties .    applying this general theory ,",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath11 and the graphs arising from the p , d and g surfaces .",
    "the classification of special points and their @xmath0 algebras for the @xmath12 surface was one of the main aims of @xcite .",
    "we will review those results here giving a concise statement of the main results .",
    "the @xmath13 surface is much simpler since in this case @xmath14 .",
    "the d case has not yet been considered before , and we give the complete entirely new calculation here .",
    "the general setup is following the noncommutative approach we call connes - bellissard - harper approach @xcite .",
    "we start by considering a @xmath0 algebra @xmath1 which is the smallest algebra containing the hamiltonian and the symmetries .",
    "the standard choice of the hamiltonian is the harper hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this acts on the hilbert space @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the vertices of the graph .",
    "physically , this corresponds to using the tight - binding approximation and peierls substitution @xcite .",
    "if we turn on a magnetic field this procedure expresses the hamiltonian in terms of a sum of magnetic translation or wannier @xcite operators . in the general setting the magnetic field will be given by a two form on @xmath17 which in @xmath18 restricts to the familiar vector field @xmath19 .",
    "we will concentrate on the case of a constant magnetic field @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the skew  symmetric matrix of a skew ",
    "symmetric 2-tensor .",
    "we will now describe our setup in more detail .",
    "fix @xmath22 to be a connected embedded graph whose edges are line segments .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 a ( maximal ) translational symmetry group of @xmath24 , s.t .",
    "@xmath25 is finite . here",
    "a translational symmetry group is a group isomorphic to a free abelian group of rank @xmath2 which acts by translations on @xmath17 leaving @xmath24 invariant .",

    "notice that @xmath31 , but in general this inclusion is strict . on @xmath32 a magnetic translation by a vector @xmath33 of @xmath23",
    "is represented by a unitary operator @xmath34 , while a translation by a vector in @xmath30 only gives rise to a partial isometry . to see this",
    ", we decompose the hilbert space @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "then a translation by @xmath37 which goes from @xmath38 to @xmath39 will act as @xmath40 . in this formalism",

    "@xmath1 is a @xmath0 sub - algebra of the operators on @xmath32 . in order to calculate the algebra @xmath1 more explicitly ,",
    "we wish to define a matrix representation of it . for this one fixes a rooted spanning tree . a spanning tree is a subtree of the graph , which contains all vertices .",
    "being rooted means that one vertex is distinguished .    our main theorem which allows us to do explicit computations is then :    * theorem .",
    "* @xcite for @xmath24 , @xmath23 as above and a fixed @xmath19 given by @xmath41 , fixing a choice of rooted spanning tree for @xmath42 , an order of the vertices of @xmath42 and a basis for @xmath23 defines a faithful matrix representation of @xmath1 which is a sub@xmath0algebra @xmath43 of the @xmath0 algebra @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the noncommutative torus .",
    "* consequence . * from this it follows , that if @xmath7 is rational then the spectrum of @xmath46 has finitely many gaps",
    ". moreover the maximal number is determined by the entries of @xmath7 .    in the case of the square lattice",
    ", this gives rise to the hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "hence our result can be viewed as a generalization to the lattices of our setup .    in the above theorem ,",
    "the translations of @xmath23 are what gives rise to the noncommutative torus .",
    "in particular each fixed basis element @xmath47 of @xmath23 gives rise to a unitary diagonal operator valued matrix @xmath48 .",
    "these matrices satisfy the commutation relations @xmath49 and hence give a representation of @xmath45 which is the @xmath0 algebra spanned by @xmath2 independent unitary operators @xmath50 satisfying the commutation relations @xmath51 . in the matrix representation of the hamiltonian , each partial isometry which corresponds to the summand of the hamiltonian describing the translation along the edge joining the vertex @xmath3 to the vertex @xmath52 gives rise to a @xmath45 valued matrix entry in the @xmath53-th position .",
    "notice that there are two incarnations of the harper hamiltonian , the first , which we will simply call the harper hamiltonian is the operator acting on @xmath54 .",

    "thus starting with @xmath24 and @xmath30 in @xmath18 we get a new geometry @xmath59 . here the base @xmath60 is given by the possible exponential values of momenta in the basis directions of @xmath23 .",
    "the cover can then be interpreted as the different eigenvalues of @xmath46 .",
    "let us call a point non  degenerate if @xmath46 at theses fixed momenta has @xmath2 distinct eigenvalues . since this is an open condition",
    ", we get that if there is one point which is non  degenerate then that this is generically the case .",

    "it is also proper , since it does not surject onto the image of @xmath174 , for instance @xmath220 is not in the image .",
    "since @xmath266 we see that @xmath267 , likewise one checks that @xmath268 and hence @xmath269 . to get the other inclusion ,",
    "one proceeds in the usual fashion to obtain the matrices @xmath270 by multiplying @xmath271 with elements of @xmath272 and subtracting we get the matrices @xmath273,@xmath273,@xmath274 and @xmath275 which generate @xmath276 .",
    "thus @xmath277 .    in case ( b )",
    "( 1 ) with the assumption @xmath218 , we can either have @xmath278 in which case the usual procedure produces the full matrix algebra or @xmath139 in which case we obtain the matrices @xmath279 and their adjoints . set @xmath280 . then both @xmath180 and @xmath19 commute with @xmath272 and with each other .",
    "now @xmath281 and @xmath282 .",
    "since @xmath283 we see that @xmath46 is in the @xmath0 sub  algebra spanned by @xmath272 , @xmath180 and @xmath19 with the given relations . to show that this is not the full matrix algebra , we can use the mapping of @xmath284 given by @xmath285 where @xmath286 are the generators of @xmath287 , which satisfy @xmath288 .",
    "we see that @xmath289 is the two sided @xmath0 ideal generated by @xmath290 .",
    "the map @xmath174 induced a map @xmath291 .",
    "since the image of @xmath180 is the image of @xmath292 , we see that the image of @xmath1 is generated by @xmath293 and @xmath294 , which does not contain @xmath220 .",
    "hence @xmath295 is not surjective and @xmath43 is not the full algebra . from this",
    "it is also easy to see that in @xmath296 , @xmath180 and @xmath19 satisfy no other relations modulo @xmath272 .",
    "this is the family ( iii ) .",
    "the case ( b)(2 ) yields the full algebra unless @xmath297 and hence all @xmath219 .",
    "the case ( c ) is completely analogous upon switching @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "( c)(1 ) yields the family @xmath300 .    in the case ( d ) @xmath301 plays the special role , which @xmath298 played in ( b)(1 ) and hence the condition is that @xmath302 .",
    "this yields the case of the family ( v ) .",
