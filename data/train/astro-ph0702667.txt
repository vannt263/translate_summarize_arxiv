    "modern theories ( such as the string theory and m - theory ) predict temporal and spatial variations of fundamental physical constants . some recent studies of quasar absorbtion spectra indicate that the fine structure constant @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the charge of the electron and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the reduced planck constant and the speed of light respectively , could have changed during the evolution of the universe ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this result was not confirmed by other groups @xcite , and hence new experiments are required .",
    "laboratory experiments are rapidly increasing their sensitivity to @xmath1-variation ( see @xcite and references therein ) , but are currently slightly less sensitive than astrophysical ones , where the time scale is @xmath6 times longer .",
    "finally , there may be some evidence for varying @xmath1 from the natural nuclear reactor in oklo , which operated about 2 billion years ago @xcite .",
    "astrophysical studies are based on the fact that atomic transition frequencies depend on the parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the laboratory value of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , one can look for @xmath1-variation by comparing the frequencies of atomic lines in the spectra of quasars with their laboratory values , which correspond to @xmath9 .",
    "one of the major systematic effects , which can imitate @xmath1-variation , is the isotope shift ( is ) .",
    "it had been shown previously @xcite that typical is is of the same order of magnitude as the effect observed in @xcite .    in @xcite , a method to separate the effect of varying @xmath1 from the is was proposed .",
    "this method is based on building special combinations of atomic frequencies , some of which are insensitive to both effects ( `` anchors '' ) , while the other are independent on the is , but sensitive to @xmath1-variations ( `` probes '' ) .",
    "one could then use the anchors to retrieve the actual value of the redshift of the spectrum , and then use the probes to evaluate the size of the variation @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , one can form the probes that are sensitive to the is , but not to the variation of @xmath1 .",
    "these probes could provide information about isotopic abundances in the early universe .",
    "such information should also be of interest to the astrophysicists , because isotopic evolution is tightly linked with the general evolution of the universe .",
    "described method of anchors and probes requires precise calculations of atomic relativistic coefficients @xmath11 , which determine the dependence of transition frequencies on @xmath12 , and the is coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "factors @xmath11 strongly depend on the total angular momentum @xmath14 , which distinguishes levels of the same multiplet .",
    "relativistic corrections to the coefficients @xmath13 are known to be small and their dependence on @xmath14 is much weaker . nevertheless in order to separate two effects reliably",
    ", one needs to accurately account for relativistic corrections to is . for light atoms",
    "is is dominated by the mass shift ( ms ) .",
    "usually ms calculations are done with dirac wave functions , but using non - relativistic form of ms operator . in this paper",
    "we report results of the ms calculations for 12 light atoms and ions .",
    "we use the ms operator , which includes relativistic corrections of the order of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is shown that relativistic corrections to the operator partly compensate corrections to the wave functions and final relativistic corrections are smaller than in previous calculations .",
    "that may help to distinguish between @xmath1-variation and isotope effects in astrophysics .",
    "total is consists of ms and field shift ( fs ) .",
    "the former accounts for the finite mass of the nucleus , and the latter accounts for the finite size of the nucleus . in the non - relativistic theory",
    "the ms is further divided into normal mass shift ( nms ) , and specific mass shift ( sms ) .",
    "the overall is in the frequency of any atomic transition of the isotope with mass number @xmath15 with respect to the isotope with mass number @xmath16 can be written as ( see , for example @xcite ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the nuclear mean square radius , @xmath19 is the fs coefficient and @xmath20 is the ms coefficient . in the non - relativistic theory nms",
    "is described by one - electron operator , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is momentum of the @xmath23-th electron . because of the virial theorem @xmath24 has the simple form : @xmath25 where the number 1823 refers to the ratio of the atomic mass unit ( amu ) to the electron mass .",
    "sms is described by a two - electron operator : @xmath26 consistent relativistic theory of ms can be formulated only within quantum electrodynamics in a form of expansion in @xmath27 .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that the first two terms of the expansion in @xmath27 lead to the following relativistic ms hamiltonian : @xmath28 \\bm{p}_j    \\right\\ } , \\label{hmsrel}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the dirac matrix of the @xmath23-th electron and @xmath30 . as in the non - relativistic theory , one can divide hamiltonian ( [ hmsrel ] ) into the one- and two - electron terms : @xmath31\\right\\}_i^2\\ , , \\label{hnmsrel}\\\\ \\begin{split } h_\\mathrm{sms } & = \\frac{1}{m } \\sum_{i < k } \\left\\{\\bm{p } - \\frac{\\alpha z}{2r } \\left[\\bm{\\alpha}+ ( \\bm{\\alpha}\\cdot\\hat{\\bm{r}})\\hat{\\bm{r}}\\right]\\right\\}_i \\\\ & \\times \\left\\{\\bm{p } - \\frac{\\alpha z}{2r } \\left[\\bm{\\alpha}+ ( \\bm{\\alpha}\\cdot\\hat{\\bm{r}})\\hat{\\bm{r}}\\right]\\right\\}_k\\ , .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{hsmsrel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] non - relativistic expression is not applicable to operator and now @xmath32  has to be calculated on a same footing as @xmath33 .    as pointed out above , for the light atoms and ions fs is much smaller than ms . still for the comparison with high precision experiments one may need to account for fs .",
    "below we focus on calculating ms , but in the final table  [ final - is ] we present fs factors for some of the transitions .",
    "is is very sensitive to electron correlations .",
    "high accuracy calculations must account not only for correlations between valence electrons , but also for core - valence correlations . here",
    "we treat both types of correlations within ci+mbpt method @xcite . in this method",
    "the configuration interaction ( ci ) calculation is done for valence electrons using effective hamiltonian @xmath34 , which is formed within the second order many body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) in the residual core - valence interaction .",
    "all our calculations are done with modified dirac - fock code @xcite , ci code @xcite , and mbpt code @xcite .",
    "ci+mbpt method is easily reformulated for the is calculations within the finite - field approximation . in this approximation",
    "the is operator @xmath35 is added to the many - particle hamiltonian @xmath36 with an arbitrary coefficient @xmath37 : @xmath38 the eigenvalue problem for hamiltonian is solved for @xmath39 and for @xmath40 .",
    "then , the is correction to the energy is recovered as : @xmath41 all calculations are done independently for the field , normal , and specific parts of the is .",
    "parameter @xmath37 is chosen from the considerations of the numerical stability and smallness of the the non - linear terms . in the ci+mbpt calculations hamiltonian",
    "is used to construct @xmath42 .",
    "that means that @xmath43 is used on all stages of calculation starting from solving dirac - fock equations for atomic core .",
    "ci+mbpt method provides the solution of the eigenvalue problem for valence electrons @xmath44 , which is an approximation to all - electron problem @xmath45 .",
    "the latter equation gives an exact solution for the given basis set .",
    "unfortunately this equation can be solved only for atoms with few electrons and only for very short basis sets .",
    "nevertheless , on a short basis set we can compare all - electron and ci+mbpt calculations with some simple calculation ( for example , with one - configurational approximation ) and designate corresponding corrections as @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "then we repeat ci+mbpt calculation on a much longer basis set and find new correction @xmath48 .",
    "although we can not make all - electron calculation for the long basis set , we can use the short basis set calculation to shift the central point of the final ci+mbpt calculation and estimate its error : @xmath49 we will use eq .",
