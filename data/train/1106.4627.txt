    "in the last decade there are wide variety of modern cosmological observations namely precision measurements of anisotropies in the cosmological microwave background radiation @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillation @xcite and type ia supernova @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that at present our universe is composed of nearly @xmath0 cold dark matter ( dm ) , @xmath1 nonbaryonic unknown matter known as dark energy ( de)@xciteand @xmath2 of radiation and baryonic matter which ia well understood by the standard models of particles .",
    "the natural and leading choice of the unknown de is the cosmological constant(@xmath3 model ) which represents a vacuum energy density having constant equation of state @xmath4 .",
    "however , its observed value is far below than the esteemation from quantum field theory(known as cosmological constant problem ) . also there is no expectation why the constant vacuum energy and matter energy densities are precisely of the same order today(coincidence problem ) . due to these observational @xcite and theoretical @xcite probes for the cosmological constant",
    "there are alternative models for de ( varies from time ) in the literature .",
    "scalar field models @xcite ( known as quintesence ) have attracted special attention compared to the other alternatives @xcite .",
    "the fact that at present de and dm are dominant sources of the content of the universe , there has been a lot of interest in studying coupling in the dark sector components @xcite .",
    "it is partly motivated by the fact that one can only extract information of these components through gravitational interaction . also consideration of interaction",
    "is natural in the framework of field theory @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that an appropriate choice of the interaction between de and dm can alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .    to have some inside about the unknown and mysterious nature of de , many people have suggested that de should be compatible with holographic principle , namely `` the number of relevant degrees of freedom of a system dominated by gravity must vary along with the area of the surface bounding the system''@xcite .",
    "such a de model is known as holographic de(hde ) model .",
    "further the energy density of any given region should be bound by that ascribed to a schwarzschild black hole(bh ) that fills the same volume @xcite .",
    "mathematically , we write @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the de density , @xmath7 is the size of the region(or infrared cut off ) and @xmath8 is the reduced planck mass . usually , the de density is written as @xmath9 here the dimensionless parameter @xmath10 takes care of the uncertainties of the theory and for mathematical convenience the factor 3 has been introduced .",
    "due to lack of clear idea there are many choices for the infrared cut off of which the most relevant one are the hubble radius , i.e . , @xmath11@xcite and the ricci s length , i.e. , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the argument behind the choice of ricci s length as the ir cut - off is that it corresponds to the size of the maximal perturbation , leading to the formation of a black hole@xcite .",
    "another commonly used ir cut - off length is the radius of future event horizon , but it suffers from a severe circularity problem .    in the present paper we consider a cosmological model of holographic de ( hde ) in the form of a perfect fluid interacting with dm in the form of dust . the choice of the ir cut - off is chosen as the ricci s length , i.e.,@xcite @xmath13 the evolution equations of the model are formulated into an autonomous system and critical points are analysed .",
    "explicit solutions are obtained and are analysed asymptotically .",
    "in the present work , the homogeneous and isotropic frw universe is assumed to fill up with interacting two fluid system - one component is in the form of dust(having energy density @xmath14 ) known as dark matter(dm ) while perfect fluid having barotropic equation of state @xmath15 , @xmath16 , a variable is the de component .",
    "assuming spatialy flat model , the friedmann equations are ( choosing @xmath17 ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 and we have the conservation equations @xmath20 @xmath21 here the interaction term @xmath22 indicates transfer of energy from de component to dm sector while opposite is the situation for @xmath23 . as @xmath23 would worsen the coincidence problem so we choose @xmath22 throughout the work .",
    "also validity of the second law of thermodynamics and le chatelier s principle @xcite support this choice of positive q. it should be noted that we have not included baryonic matter in the interaction due to the constraints imposed by local gravity measurements @xcite . in the next two sections we shall deal with two different choices of interaction term separately , namely , @xmath24 @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , the total energy density ) and @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "the first choice is the special case of the usual one used in the literature as a linear combination of the energy densities .",
    "the second choice is physically more viable in the sense that interaction rate vanishes if one of the densities is zero and increases with each of the densities .",
    "also this choice of interaction for hde models gives the best fit to observations @xcite .",
    "also it should be noted that the constant @xmath29 has the dimension of @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "+ using the field equations ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) we have the form ( [ 1 ] ) the expression for the energy density of hde as @xmath31 hence the equation of state parametercan be expressed in terms of the density parameter as @xmath32 also the deceleration parameter takes the simple form @xmath33 which shows a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration as universe evolves from the early matter dominated era to the late time de dominated and here @xmath34 .",

    "fig.1(b ) +   + fig .",
    "1(a)-1(b ) represent the variation of @xmath42 .",
    "though in fig 1(b ) the whole region is not a physically valid region but for better understanding about the system and the nature of the critical point we have drawn graph for the whole region .    from equation ( [ 12 ] )",
    "we see that the de density gradually decreases with the evolution of the universe until it is in the phantom era @xmath43 .",
    "thus if we assume the de density to be sufficiently large at the early epochs of the evolution then from equation ( [ 11 ] ) @xmath44 increases till some intermediate stage and then gradually decreases with @xmath45 along the line @xmath46 in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "thus we have @xmath48 at some intermediate stage of evolution in the neighbourhood of the above line and may be a possible resolution of coincidence problem @xcite .",
    "further , the present model of the universe shows a de dominance at the early epochs and subsequently universe evolves with dm as the dominant component and then again it has de dominated phase at late time as predicted by observation .",
    "hence the above model is suitable for the present universe .",
    "+ now to formulate an autonomous system we rewrite equation ( [ 12 ] ) using field equation ( [ 3 ] ) as @xmath49\\ ] ] and the second field equation , i.e. , equation ( [ 4 ] ) can be written as @xmath50\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 thus equations ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) form a linear homogeneous autonomous system in the phase plane @xmath52 , having critical point at the origin .",
    "for the jacobi matrix @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "but for completeness of the system we have drawn the whole figure.these figures characterizes the nature of the critical points given in table2 .",
    "the paper analyzes the hde model interacting with dm(in the form of dust ) . here",
    "the ir cut off is chosen at the ricci s length with the justification that it corresponds to the size of the maximal perturbation corresponding to formation of a black hole .",
    "the interaction between the two fluids is either a linear combination or in product form of the two energy densities of which the product form is physically more variable one . in both the cases ,",
    "the evolution equations are transformed to an autonomous system for which the nature of the critical points are presented in tabular form and are graphically analyzed .",
