    "the resourcesync collaboration between the national information standards organization ( niso ) and the open archives initiative ( oai ) focuses on designing an approach for the synchronization of web resources . as",
    "resources constantly change ( being created , updated , deleted , and moved ) @xcite applications that leverage them would benefit from a standardized synchronization framework aligned with the web architecture @xcite . the resourcesync specification @xcite ( in beta phase at the time of writing ) fulfills the needs of different communities and is , amongst others , targeted at cultural heritage portals such as europeana , repositories of scientific articles such as arxiv , and linked data applications such as dbpedia live . in the framework",
    "we refer to a * source * as a server that hosts resources subject to synchronization and to a * destination * as a system that retrieves those resources to synchronize itself with the source .",
    "different use cases imply distinct characteristics . from the source s",
    "perspective the resource volume and the resource change frequency are most relevant , whereas synchronization latency and accuracy requirements are essential considerations for destinations .",
    "the resourcesync framework therefore offers multiple modular capabilities that a source can selectively implement to address specific synchronization needs . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we discuss only two of the capabilities .",
    "an extensive discussion about the theoretical background of the framework can be found in van de sompel et al .",
    "@xcite and we refer to the specification document @xcite for a detailed description of all capabilities .",
    "the here described capabilities are the * resource list * and the * change list*. the resource list , as the name implies , is a list of resources and their descriptions that the source makes available for synchronization . the resource list presents a snapshot of the source s resources at one particular point in time and a source can publish a resource list recurrently e.g. , once a week or once a month .",
    "the change list is a list that provides information about changes to the source s resources .",
    "depending on the publication and update frequency of the change list , this capability can help decrease synchronization latency and reduce communication overhead .",
    "it is up to the source to determine the publication frequency as well as the temporal interval that is covered by a change list .",
    "it may , for example , describe all resource changes of one day , or one hour , or may simply contain a fixed number of changes , regardless of how long it takes to accumulate them . both resource list and change list serve the following purposes :    * synchronization :",
    "allow destinations to obtain current resources ; requires the resources uri .",
    "* audit : allow destinations to verify the accuracy of their synchronized content ; requires the resources last modification date and fixity information . *",
    "link : allow sources to express alternate ways for destinations to retrieve content ; requires inclusion of links .",
    "one example for the inclusion of such links is a source providing a pointer to a mirror location . in this case",
    "the source prefers destinations to obtain the resource from that specified location and not from the original uri , with the intention to reduce the load on the source .",
    "another example is a source providing a pointer to partial content , meaning only the part of the resource that has actually changed .",
    "a destination can obtain this information and use it to patch its local copy of the resource .      for consistency and to minimize the barrier of adoption , it is desirable to implement all capabilities based on a single document format instead of using multiple formats within one framework . sitemaps @xcite serve the purpose of advertising a server s resources and support search engines in their discovery . in this sense",
    "a sitemap is fairly similar to a resource list , which motivated us to investigate the use of the sitemap format for the resourcesync framework .",
    "a sitemap is an xml document , which must contain three xml elements : the root element _",
    "< urlset > _ ,",
    "one _ < url > _ child element per resource , and exactly one _ < loc > _ element as a child of each _",
    "< url > _ element that conveys the uri of the resource .",
    "the sitemap schema @xcite , allows only the _",
    "< url > _ element to be a child of the root element and none of the mandatory elements can have attributes .",
    "listing [ ls : sm_simple ] shows a simple sitemap .    ....",
    "xml version=\"1.0 \" encoding=\"utf-8 \" ?",
    "> < urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org / schemas / sitemap/0.9 \" >    < url >      < loc > http://example.com / res1</loc >      < lastmod>2013 - 02 - 01t13:00:00z</lastmod >    <",
    "/url > < /urlset > ....    the _",
    "< loc > _ element can be utilized in the resourcesync framework to convey the uri of the resource that is subject to synchronization .",
    "its last modification time can be provided with the sitemap - native optional _",
    "< lastmod > _ child element of the _",
    "< url > _ element .",
    "in order to use sitemaps for all resourcesync capabilities , extensions to the sitemap format are required on two levels : at the _ resource level _ , where child elements of an _",
    "< url > _ element need to be included that provide :    * audit : metadata about the resource such as the nature of the change , the resource s size , its content - based hash value , mime - type etc . , and * link : links to related resources such as mirror locations or partial content .    at the _ root level _ , where child elements of the _ < urlset > _",
    "element need to be included that provide :    * audit : the document s last modification time , * link : links for navigational support for destinations and to convey information about the source , and * an indication of the capability implemented by a specific sitemap document since all capability documents have the same format .    in general , we wanted to avoid google consuming resourcesync documents in an unintended way because it does not understand the extensions , yet keep them valid from the perspective of the sitemap xml schema and keep the door wide open for when google understands and eventually consumes them .",
    "these intentions led to the following concerns : + * concern 1 : * it was unclear how google would act upon the inclusion of additional child elements to the _",
    "< url > _ element .",
    "since the sitemap schema allows for external child elements as long as they are properly declared in their namespace , we did not anticipate major issues but still had to convince ourselves that our extensions were compliant . + * concern 2 : * how google responds to the inclusion of links , as children of the _ < url > _ element was unclear . if google , for example , indexes both the uri provided in the _",
    "< loc > _ element and the uri provided in the link to a mirror location , it would go against the source s intention to reduce its load . also , it is meaningless if google indexes the uri of the partial content as it is not helpful without the full resource pointed to in the _",
    "< loc > _ element .",
    "these would be unintended consequences of the inclusion of links .",
    "+ * concern 3 : * since the schema does not allow for child elements to the _",
    "< urlset > _ root element other than _ < url > _ , the concern was that google would reject the resourcesync capability documents .",
    "the behavior towards included link elements on this level was unclear too .",
    "we conducted a series of informal experiments to determine how google , as a major search engine , responds to resourcesync enhanced sitemaps .",
    "we submitted sitemaps with varying degrees of modification to google s webmaster tool @xcite , analyzed its immediately returned parsing report , and observed the effects of our sitemaps to their index .",
    "the goal of this experiment was to test the addition of metadata elements to each _",

    "< urlset > _ root element . to convey the type of change the resource underwent , we tested the addition of an _ rs : change _ attribute to the _",

    "however , we adopted the former approach because expressing a link without using the _ href _ attribute is counterintuitive .",
    "the resulting approach provides no guarantees that google will not index the uris provided in links .",
    "therefore , we additionally introduced an approach that separates discovery of resourcesync capability documents from discovery of regular sitemaps .",

    "we would be happy to see search engines such as google adopting the resourcesync format but as long as they do not understand how to interpret the content of the capability documents , the source might be better off not to advertise them in the robots.txt .",
