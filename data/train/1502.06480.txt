    "uranus experiences the solar system s largest fractional seasonal forcing because its spin axis has a 98inclination to its orbital plane .",
    "it is thus not surprising to see a time - dependent north - south asymmetry in uranus cloud structure .",
    "an especially interesting asymmetry noted by @xcite is the continued complete absence of discrete cloud features south of 45s , while numerous discrete cloud features have been observed north of 45n in recent near - ir h - filter keck images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polar ] ) .",
    "voyager imaging in 1986 recorded no bright cloud features between the south pole and 45s . nor were any seen in near - ir hubble space telescope ( hst ) images taken with the near - ir camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) beginning in 1997 , nor in keck images beginning in 2003 .",
    "some mechanism appears to be inhibiting convection at high southern latitudes that is not present at high northern latitudes .",
    "a very significant and possibly related result came from analysis of 2002 space telescope imaging spectrometer ( stis ) observations by @xcite , subsequently referenced as * kt2009 * , and confirmed by the analysis of @xcite .",
    "they found a strong depletion of methane in the upper troposphere ( down to a few bars at least ) at high southern latitudes , suggesting a downwelling flow at these latitudes , which would tend to inhibit convective cloud formation .",
    "this raised the possibility of a connection between methane depletion and a lack of discrete cloud features , suggesting that high northern latitudes , where discrete clouds are seen , might not be depleted in methane .",
    "if so , the methane depletion might be a seasonal effect . in 2002 ,",
    "five years before equinox , the sub - observer latitude was 21.4s and the north polar region was not visible , so that testing this hypothesis would require new observations when the north polar region was exposed to view .",
    "we thus proposed new stis observations of uranus , which were obtained in late september 2012 ( hst program 12894 , sromovsky , pi ) , five years after equinox , when the sub - observer latitude was 19.5n .",
    "the analysis of these new observations is the primary topic in what follows .        constraining the mixing ratio of on uranus is based on differences in the spectral absorption of and h@xmath1 , illustrated by the penetration depth plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : ccdpendepth]a",
    ". methane absorption dominates at most wavelengths , but hydrogen s collision induced absorption ( cia ) is relatively more important in a narrow spectral range near 825 nm . model calculations that do nt have the correct ratio of methane to hydrogen lead to a relative reflectivity mismatch near this wavelength .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccdpendepth]b - d , in which model calculations are compared to 2002 stis observations assuming methane profiles with 2.2% and 4.0% deep volume mixing ratios .",
    "the two assumptions lead to very different errors in the vicinity of 825 nm , clearly indicating that the larger mixing ratio is a better choice .",
    "@xcite used this spectral constraint to infer a methane mixing ratio of 3.2% at low latitudes , but dropping to 1.4% at high southern latitudes . @xcite",
    "analyzed the same data set , but used only temperature and mixing ratio profiles that were consistent with the @xcite refractivity profiles .",
    "they confirmed the depletion but inferred a somewhat higher mixing ratio of 4% at low latitudes and found that better fits were obtained if the high latitude ( down to @xmath02 - 4 bars ) .",
    "subsequently , 2009 groundbased spectral observations at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) using the spex instrument , which provided coverage of the key 825-nm spectral region , were used by @xcite to infer that both polar regions were weakly depleted in methane , but they inferred lower methane mixing ratios , smaller latitudinal variations , and higher uncertainties than the stis - based analysis of kt2009 and @xcite .",
    "these lower irtf - based values might be a result of lower spatial resolution combined with worse view angles into the polar regions than obtained by hst observations .    .",

    "we then describe the relatively direct implications of latitudinal spectral variations and simplified model results .",
    "finally , we describe our radiation transfer calculation methods and the results of constraining the cloud structure and methane distributions to fit the observed spectra .",
    "we show that the methane depletion is indeed present in both polar regions but of significantly different character .",
    "the results provide no obvious explanation for the asymmetry in polar cloud structure , but do raise some important questions about cloud formation .",
    "the important implications for meridional circulation models are discussed before summarizing our results .",
    "our 2012 observations used four hst orbits , three of them devoted to stis spatial mosaics and one orbit to wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) support imaging .",

    "fits we found that the upper tropospheric haze ( the second layer in table [ tbl : compactmodel ] ) provided a sharply increased contribution at the equator , and seemed to be the main change associated with the bright equatorial band visible in many images at wavelengths of intermediate methane absorption ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : stisimages]k , and s ) . in the compact model fits , however , changes in the next lower and higher layers ( first and third layers in table [ tbl : compactmodel ] ) seem to be relatively more important , with changes in pressure and particle size of the third layer ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) as well as the optical depth per bar of the top layer ( @xmath4 ) playing a role .",
    "the derived value of the optical depth per bar of the second layer ( @xmath5 ) for the compact model is comparable to its uncertainty and was ignored for most compact model fits .    between 30s and 30n ,",
    "the 825-nm signed error , given by ( model - observed)/uncertainty , is relatively flat .",
    "the small positive error seen in this at most latitudes in this range suggests that the mixing ratio in the f1 profile is not quite large enough .",
    "the rather large negative 825-nm errors found at high latitudes are associated with excessively high methane mixing ratios in the model calculations .",
    "the measure of fit quality is generally low , but is a more erratic function of latitude over this range .",
    "beyond 40n , the 825-nm signed error becomes much larger as the overall fit quality measured by becomes much worse .",
    "this indicates that the assumed latitude - independent profile of methane is not consistent with the observations .",
    "a different methane profile is clearly needed at high latitudes as was already demonstrated at 60n from fits used to define the scaling of the simplified model .",
    "while structure and methane profiles with a 2% deep mixing ratio provide the best fits at 60n compared to other profiles with constant mixing ratios up to the condensation level , the deep contrast between equator and pole ( 2% vmr to 4% vmr ) is not physically plausible .",
    "such deep latitudinal gradients in composition would lead to density gradients along isobars . as a consequence of geostrophic and hydrostatic balance",
    ", these gradients would lead to vertical wind shears @xcite .",
    "these vertical wind shears acting over the entire atmosphere would likely lead to cloud top winds that would be highly incompatible with the observed winds .",
    "thus we considered methane vertical distributions in which the higher latitudes had depressed mixing ratios restricted to shallow depths in the upper troposphere only . as indicated by kt2009 , the 2002 spectral observations did not require that methane depletions extend to great depths , and @xcite showed that shallow depletions were preferred by the 2002 spectra .",
    "we will show here that the 2012 spectral constraints favor relatively shallow methane depletions at middle latitudes but increasingly deeper depletions at high latitudes .",
    "here we constructed profiles with shallow depletion using the `` proportionally descended gas '' profiles of @xcite in which the model f1 mixing ratio profile @xmath6 is dropped down to increased pressure levels @xmath7 using the equation @xmath8,\\label{eq : deplete}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pressure depth at which the revised mixing ratio @xmath11 equals the uniform deep mixing ratio @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the methane condensation pressure before methane depletion , @xmath14 is the tropopause pressure ( 100 mb ) , and the exponent @xmath15 controls the shape of the profile between 100 mb and @xmath10 .",
    "the profiles with @xmath16 are similar in form to those adopted by @xcite .      to account for the lower methane mixing ratio that is observed at high latitudes we need to find a methane sink that can create local depletions .",
    "the most obvious one is methane condensation , which can cause the low - temperature above - cloud region to have much lower methane mixing ratios than the regions below .",
    "when this depleted gas is mixed downward , it can cause local depressions of the methane mixing ratio in the upper troposphere .",
    "thus we expect only the upper troposphere to be depleted and a significant question is whether we can constrain the depth of that depression using stis observations .    here",
    "we start with an f1 profile at 60n and then use eqn .",
    "[ eq : deplete ] to deplete the methane above a base pressure @xmath17 at a rate controlled by a secondary parameter @xmath15 , which causes rapid depletion with decreasing pressure when set to small values and smaller depletion rates when set to larger values .",

    "one puzzling result is that the cloud layer that we thought was associated with methane condensation ( the umtc or @xmath22 layer in fig .",
    "[ fig : structuremodels ] ) continues into the polar regions where methane condensation should not occur because of the decreased methane mixing ratio .",

    "[ fig : circ ] illustrates a mechanism for depleting methane at high latitudes that is essentially the same as what was previously suggested by kt2009 . rising methane - rich gas at low latitudes is dried out by condensation and sedimentation of methane ice particles . that dried gas is then transported to high latitudes , where it begins to descend , bringing down methane depleted gas , which then gets mixed with methane - rich gas on its return flow .",
    "the figure illustrates two different styles of return flow . without lateral eddy mixing across the streamlines ,",
    "the only restoration of the methane mixing ratio would be through evaporation of the precipitating condensed methane at low latitudes .",
    "the depth of the depletion at high latitudes might be controlled by the depth of the meridional cell or the depth at which cross - streamline mixing predominates .",
    "the suggested circulation would promote formation of optically thin methane clouds ( or hazes ) at low latitudes , but inhibit methane cloud formation at high latitudes .",
    "this seems consistent with the lack of observed discrete cloud features south of 45s .",
    "however , we have seen discrete cloud features at high northern latitudes @xcite , which might very well be composed of something other than methane , given that their cloud tops seem to be deeper than the methane condensation level @xcite .",
    "the general downwelling would also tend to inhibit all condensation clouds , as sub - condensation mixing ratios would be created by such motions",
    ". however , this does not rule out localized regions of upwelling and formation of condensation clouds occupying a small fractional area .",
    "the circulation cell in fig .",
    "[ fig : circ ] would need to be very deep to be consistent with microwave observations probing the 10 - 100 bar region of uranus @xcite .",
    "these reveal a symmetry pattern in which microwave absorbers ( nh@xmath27 , h@xmath1s ) are depleted at both high southern and high northern latitudes , suggesting a non - seasonal equator - to - pole meridional circulation , with upwelling at low latitudes and down - welling at high latitudes @xcite , similar to the circulation cells illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : circ ] .",
    "if this deep cell extended to the upper troposphere , it could be consistent with a shallow ch@xmath28 depletion , as long as the flow at the several bar level was dominated by poleward flow that did not go through the drying - by - condensation process , as suggested by the inner streamline in the northern flow pattern in fig .",
    "[ fig : circ ] .",
    "while our best fits indicate that the largest fractional depletions occur in the upper troposphere , at higher latitudes some degree of depletion could extend deeper than the 10-bar level . because these deep meridional cells would likely be dominated by deep atmospheric conditions",
    ", they would probably have the same symmetry properties as the deep atmosphere ( symmetry about the equator ) , which would suggest qualitatively that the north and south polar regions should not look very different . with respect to the gross character of the methane depletion , they do nt look very different , even though they do exhibit different cloud morphologies .",
    "a problem with a single deep cell in each hemisphere is that it would seem to inhibit formation of h@xmath1s condensation clouds that are good candidates for producing the bright bands that form between 38and 58 in both hemispheres .",
    "in fact , such a simple circulation would tend to inhibit all condensation clouds at high latitudes , in spite of the fact that cloud particles of some kind are detected there . a 3-layer circulation cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : circ3 ] ) can provide more opportunities for condensation cloud formation . in this case",
    "the deep cell produces ammonia depletion through formation of an nh@xmath28sh cloud at low latitudes , an intermediate cell produces high latitude condensation of h@xmath1s , and the top cell provides high - latitude depletion of methane .",
    "this structure is also qualitatively compatible with the observed equatorward motion of the long - lived and largest discrete cloud feature seen on uranus , known as the berg @xcite .",
    "this feature is thought to have been at the level of the putative h@xmath1s cloud , and in this model would ride along with the equatorial flow near the 1.5 bar level .",
    "however , the resemblance between the speculated structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : circ3 ] and the structure shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : compactvslat ] is crude at best . while there seems to be a change in cloud structure between high and low latitudes , if the interpretation is restricted to models with condensation clouds only",
    ", it is hard to explain the existence of what seems to be an h@xmath1s cloud at low latitudes where the three - layer cell structure would inhibit such a cloud .",
    "furthermore , the drift of the berg may not be a relevant constraint on meridional flow .",
    "if the cloud features comprising the berg were generated by an unseen vortex , its drift may be controlled more by the vorticity of the zonal flow than by weak meridional flows @xcite .",
    "an additional problem with the above suggested meridional circulation structures is that they do not appear to be consistent with voyager observations .",
    "using thermal emission measurements by the voyager iris instrument in 1986 @xcite inferred upwelling motions at @xmath2930 , where relatively lower temperatures were measured , and subsidence at both equator and poles .",
    "the temperatures were measured in the 60 - 200 mbar and 600 - 1000 mbar regions , and the circulations inferred from a zonally symmetric linear model with frictional and radiative damping .",
    "but this symmetric pattern is not evident in the para fraction distribution inferred by @xcite , which indicates a seasonal contrast between hemispheres at the time of the voyager encounter , with the northern hemisphere having lower temperatures and higher para fractions , consistent with radiative cooling and downward motion .",
    "hadley cell configurations with hemispherical symmetry are also not consistent with recent numerical modeling of the seasonal circulation of uranus by @xcite , which indicates that there should be tropospheric cross - equatorial flow peaking near equinox .",
    "another point worth noting is that the presumed upwelling at low latitudes , which is supported by the inference of an optically thin methane cloud in those regions , is not accompanied by an abundance of discrete cloud features at those latitudes .",
    "likewise , the observed cloud structure at high northern latitudes , which appear somewhat deeper than expected for condensed methane , may be more related to localized upwellings rather than any broadly defined meridional cells",
    ". this may be similar to the situation on jupiter in which a region of overall downwelling ( a belt ) contains many examples of localized convection and lightning @xcite .",
    "it is also conceivable that local increases in methane humidity might affect aerosol opacity even though the methane mixing ratio remained below saturation .",
    "the effect of water vapor humidity on the size and scattering properties of hygroscopic aerosols is significant and well known in the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that a haze of hydrocarbon aerosols originally formed in the stratosphere might have their scattering properties altered in regions of varying methane humidity , even without the occurrence of methane condensation .",
    "such an effect might even give the appearance of a condensation cloud in regions of local upwelling .",
    "however , we do not know if the background aerosols on uranus would interact with methane in the same way as hygroscopic aerosols interact with water vapor in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "neptune provides an interesting second example of methane depletion at high latitudes . using 2003 stis spectra of neptune",
    ", @xcite showed that between 80s and 20n the variation in neptune s effective methane mixing ratio was very similar to that observed for uranus . to explain this distribution they also suggested a mechanism similar to what is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : circ ] . in this case , the 45- 50s latitude band , one of the most active regions of cloud formation on neptune @xcite turns out to be a region where downwelling is needed to explain the methane depletion results .",

    "- hydrogen disequilibrium @xcite suggested a symmetric meridional circulation with cold air rising at mid - latitudes and warm air sinking at equator and poles .",
    "based on a multiwavelength analysis that included near - ir to microwave observations in 2003 , @xcite also detected warm polar and equatorial regions , where they infer downwelling motion , and cooler middle latitudes , where they infer upwelling motion .",
    "such a circulation pattern is inferred to extend to great depths and would seem to be in conflict with the pattern needed to produce the observed upper tropospheric methane depletion .",
    "thus , both planets seem to have more complicated stories than we are currently able to explain with simplified models .",
    "we observed uranus with the hst / stis instrument in 2012 , aligning the instrument s slit parallel to the spin axis of uranus and stepping the slit across the face of uranus from the limb to the center of the planet , building up half an image with each of 1800 wavelengths from 300.4 to 1020 nm .",
    "the main purpose was to constrain the distribution of methane in the atmosphere of uranus , taking advantage of the wavelength region near 825 nm where where hydrogen absorption competes with methane absorption and displays a clear spectral signature . our analysis of stis observations of uranus from 2012 and comparisons with similar 2002 observations , as well as analysis of imaging observations from 2007 , have led us to the following conclusions .    1 .   in 2012",
    "the methane mixing ratio in the upper troposphere of uranus was depleted at high northern latitudes ( relative to equatorial values ) , especially beyond 40latitude , to a degree very similar to what was inferred for southern high latitudes from 2002 stis observations .",
    "this is based on ( 1 ) direct spectral comparisons of stis latitudinal profiles at wavelengths with similar penetration depths but different amounts of hydrogen absorption , ( 2 ) simplified quantitative modeling of the 815 - 835 nm spectrum , and ( 3 ) full radiative transfer modeling .",
    "we also found that the north and south depletions were simultaneous in 2007 , as also suggested by the @xcite analysis of 2009 spex central meridian spectra , and thus probably not a seasonal effect .",
    "our 2007 result is based on direct spectral comparisons near the equinox , using an hst / nicmos f108n image that is sensitive to h@xmath1 absorption and a keck / nirc2 pabeta - filtered image that senses about the same atmospheric level , but is dominated by methane absorption .",
    "3 .   we followed kt2009 in using a simplified model of the 815 nm - 835 nm spectral region to estimate the relative latitudinal variation of the methane volume mixing ratio at 1intervals .",
    "when this relative variation was absolutely scaled to match effective mixing ratios determined by full radiative transfer modeling at 10s , the equator , and 60n , we found that the effective mixing ratio varied on both large and small spatial scales . at the large scale we found the vmr to increase from roughly 2% within 30 - 40of the poles to about 4% within 20 - 30of the equator .",
    "the 2012 observations suggest an overall increase in methane vmr at low latitudes by about 0.5% relative to 2002",
    ". however , this might be due to a change in the vertical distribution of aerosols at low latitudes rather than a change in methane vmr .",
    "4 .   between 60n and 82n ,",
    "the simplified model revealed a variation of @xmath290.005 in methane vmr relative to a local mean of 0.020 , and a nearly sinusoidal variation with a period of about 10 in latitude .",
    "a similar variation was not seen in south polar regions using the same analysis techniques on a similar stis data set from 2002 .",
    "nevertheless , there is a chance that this feature is not real and needs confirmation by further measurements .",
    "5 .   using keck2/nirc2 high - pass filtered h - band images from 16 august and 4 november 2012 , we computed zonally averaged brightnesses and compared their variations with latitude with the methane vmr variations between 55n and 82n .",
    "we found similar patterns in the latitudinal variations of cloud reflectivity in august and november images and both had significant negative correlations with the methane vmr modulations in the same latitude region , suggesting that latitude bands of reduced above - cloud methane make the clouds appear brighter due to reduced methane absorption .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the methane mixing ratio is relatively constant in this region , with para fraction variations ( associated with local vertical circulation cells ) explaining the variation in relative strengths of ch@xmath28 and h@xmath1 absorptions . in this case",
    "downwelling correlates with reduced cloud reflectivity .",
    "6 .   at 60n",
    ", we tried a variety of vertical variation functions for the methane depletion profile , characterized by the exponent @xmath15 , which we varied from 1 to 5 .",
    "we found that the depletion depth @xmath17 increased as the sharpness of the depletion decreased , with best - fit mixing ratios near 1.7 bars being comparable for all choices of @xmath15 .",
    "the best fit of all was obtained for @xmath15 = 3 , with @xmath15 = 2 also providing a good fit with somewhat better agreement between the @xmath17 that minimized ( 10 bars ) and the @xmath17 that minimized the 825-nm error ( 7.5 bars ) .",
    "we carried out fits to determine depletion depth as a function of latitude , assuming a depletion profile shape defined by @xmath20 and also by @xmath21 , with the latter shape providing the best fit at all latitudes .",
    "we found that @xmath17 increased with latitude , beginning just beyond 30n . at high latitudes",
    "the depth of the downwelling flow could exceed ten bars or more , although we are only sensitive to the upper tropospheric depletions ( @xmath30 bars , as indicated by the penetration depth plot of fig .",
    "2 ) , so that the relatively large depletion depths we found may be partly a result of the particular empirical function we used in our models .",
    "other profile shapes might be able to fit the data without producing as great a depth of depletion .",
    "8 .   using the depleted profiles to constrain the aerosol parameters , we found a lowering in the altitude ( increase in base pressure ) of the @xmath22 layer north of 30n ( the third aerosol layer from the top ) .",
    "since the lowered methane mixing ratio also implies that this layer can no longer be associated with widespread methane condensation ( at lower latitudes it is located at the methane condensation level ) , it might here be composed of other materials or produced by widely dispersed local convective events , or produced by changes in background aerosols due to absorption of methane instead of condensation of methane .",
    "the association of high - latitude methane depletions with descending motions of an equator - to - pole deep hadley cell does not seem to be consistent with the behavior of the detected aerosol layers , at least if one ignores other cloud generation mechanisms such as sparse local convection .",
    "both on uranus and neptune , aerosol layers seem to form in what are thought to be downwelling regions on the basis of the effective methane mixing ratio determinations .",
    "a three - layer set of circulation cells offers some advantages in producing condensation clouds , but also fails to provide a good match to the detected aerosol layers .",
    "10 . secular changes between 2002 and 2012 vary with wavelength . at continuum wavelengths changes appear to be very small .",
    "when the kt2009 calibration is adjusted by 3% to match wfpc2 bandpass filtered images , the 2002 i / f value are found to be 2% greater than corresponding 2012 values .",
    "this residual difference may be due to calibration uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , at wavelengths with noticeable gas absorption ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : latscan3 ] ) , the northern hemisphere has brightened considerably since 2002 , by about 25% at mid latitudes at 827 nm , and the southern hemisphere has darkened , by about 25% at mid latitudes at 827 nm .    in the future , better constraints on the vertical profile of methane as a function of latitude could be addressed by additional modeling work with the 2012 stis spectra , trying different functional forms for vertical depletion profiles .",
    "more detailed analysis at more latitudes using full radiation transfer modeling for both 2002 and 2012 would be useful in clarifying whether low - latitude changes between 2002 and 2012 are real .",
    "additional stis observations in future cycles are also needed to confirm the northern high - latitude modulations we found in the apparent mixing ratio .",
    "additional quantitative constraints might also be derived from analysis of the vertical wind shears that are implied by the horizontal density gradients associated with latitudinal compositional gradients",

    "<S> from space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) observations of uranus in 2012 , when good views of its north polar regions were available , we found that the methane volume mixing ratio declined from about 4% at low latitudes to about 2% at 60n and beyond . this depletion in the north polar region of uranus in 2012 </S>",
    "<S> is similar in magnitude and depth to that found in the south polar regions in 2002 . </S>",
    "<S> this similarity is remarkable because of the strikingly different appearance of clouds in the two polar regions : we have never seen any obvious signs of convective activity in the south polar region , while the north has been peppered with numerous small clouds thought to be of convective origin . </S>",
    "<S> keck and hubble space telescope imaging observations close to equinox at wavelengths of 1080 nm and 1290 nm , with different sensitivities to methane and hydrogen absorption but similar vertical contribution functions , imply that the depletions were simultaneously present in 2007 , and at least their gross character is probably a persistent feature of the uranus atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the depletion appears to be mainly restricted to the upper troposphere , with the depth increasing poleward from about 30n , reaching @xmath04 bars at 45n and perhaps much deeper at 70n , where it is not well constrained by our observations . </S>",
    "<S> the latitudinal variations in degree and depth of the depletions are important constraints on models of meridional circulation . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are qualitatively consistent with previously suggested circulation cells in which rising methane - rich gas at low latitudes is dried out by condensation and sedimentation of methane ice particles as the gas ascends to altitudes above the methane condensation level , then is transported to high latitudes , where it descends and brings down methane depleted gas . </S>",
    "<S> since this cell would seem to inhibit formation of condensation clouds in regions where clouds are actually inferred from spectral modeling , it suggests that sparse localized convective events may be important in cloud formation . </S>",
    "<S> a more complex meridional circulation pattern may be necessary to reproduce the observed cloud distribution , but microwave observations appear to be most compatible with a single deep circulation cell . </S>",
    "<S> the small - scale latitudinal variations we found in the effective methane mixing ratio between 55n and 82n have significant inverse correlations with zonal mean latitudinal variations in cloud reflectivity in near - ir keck images taken before and after the hst observations . </S>",
    "<S> if the /h@xmath1 absorption ratio variations are interpreted as local variations in para fraction instead of methane mixing ratio , we find that downwelling correlates with reduced cloud reflectivity . </S>",
    "<S> while there has been no significant secular change in the brightness of uranus at continuum wavelengths between 2002 and 2012 , there have been significant changes at wavelengths sensing methane and/or hydrogen absorption , with the southern hemisphere darkening considerably between 2002 and 2012 , by @xmath025% at mid latitudes near 827 nm , for example , while the northern hemisphere has brightened by @xmath025% at mid latitudes at the same wavelength . </S>"
