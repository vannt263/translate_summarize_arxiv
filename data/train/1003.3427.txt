    "complex fragment emission(@xmath6 ) in intermediate energy nuclear reactions has been a subject of both experimental and theoretical interest for many years@xcite .",
    "the early studies of this process identified two components : a fast , non - equilibrium component producing light fragments at forward angles , and a relaxed component producing fragments at all angles .",
    "systematic studies of the relaxed component at low bombarding energies demonstrated the compound nucleus(cn ) nature of the emission process @xcite .",
    "we consider the formation of cn and its statistical decay within the dinuclear system(dns ) model@xcite .",
    "the evolution of dns in mass(charge ) asymmetry coordinate is responsible for the formation of cn and its decay .",
    "let s consider two colliding nuclei , with mass and charge numbers @xmath7(projectile ) and @xmath8(target ) with an initial kinetic energy @xmath9 of projectile .",
    "the first step in formation of cn is the capture of the projectile by the target which leads to formation of dinuclear system(dns ) .",
    "the probability of capture process depends on dissipation of kinetic energy of projectile , on angular momentum @xmath10 of the system and on mass(charge ) asymmetry of colliding nuclei . for a given projectile - target combination",
    ", there is some critical value of @xmath10 , in which the potential pocket disappears . at higher angular momentums than @xmath11",
    ", projectile can not be captured . for",
    "the reactions which we consider here , all partial waves from @xmath12 to @xmath13 contribute to capture cross section .",
    "@xmath13 is determined from @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17-nuclear potential , @xmath18 is a coulomb potential , @xmath19 is coulomb barrier distance for the entrance channel .",
    "the partial capture cross section is @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is reduced mass and @xmath23 is a probability of crossing the coulomb barrier . for the energies well above the coulomb barrier @xmath24 .    from the initial dns configuration ,",
    "system can evolve in three different ways : in a direction to complete fusion , to quasifission or in a direction to the symmetric configuration .",
    "the dynamics of the system in mass(charge ) asymmetry coordinate is determined by driving potential@xcite and by quasifission barrier @xmath25 at each configuration . for the asymmetric reactions , at zero angular momentum , the quasifission barrier @xmath25 and barrier for going to symmetric configuration @xmath26 is very high relatively to fusion barrier @xmath27 , so the system will evolve with high probability to fusion . the complex fragment emission cross section given as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a probability of complete fusion which depends on competition between fusion and quasifission .",
    "here we use fermi - gas expression for the nuclear temperature @xmath30 with excitation energy of compound nucleus @xmath31 .",
    "we use rigid body moment of inertia for calculation of rotational energy @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 in equation ( 1 ) is the emission probability of a given particle from excited cn , @xmath34 is a decay width of a given channel , @xmath35 is the normalized weight factor for given dns configuration .",
    "decay width is given by transition state formalism as in ref .",
    "we use fermi - gas model expression for level densities . the emission of complex fragments from excited cn follow two steps : first",
    "this complex fragment must be formed and then overcome the emission barrier . the formation of complex fragment we understand as transition from cn configuration to dns configuration .",
    "each dns configuration has a weight factor which is of the form @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the potential energy of dns configuration at minima in relative distance between nuclei .",
    "the cn configuration has the weight factor @xmath38 .",
    "for the emission of light particles until alpha particles , we use binding energy+coulomb barrier as the emission barrier .",
    "the excitation energy of given dns is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the potential energy of dns(determined with respect to cn energy ) of given configuration at minima . if @xmath41 , then the complex fragment ca nt be formed .",
    "the formation of dns , which lies in the right side of the b.g .",
    "point in driving potential is possible only if excitation energy is larger than @xmath42 . for the generation of cascade decay process of excited cn",
    ", we use monte - carlo technique . after each decay process , we recalculate the excitation energies of decay products as    @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the mass number of decaying cn , @xmath45 is potential energy at the barrier for a given dns configuration .",
    "in the decay process , when cn decays into two nearly equal pieces , it produces always neutron rich nuclei , and in this cases if the neutron is unbound , then we just evaporate it from the nuclei without taking any excitation energy .",
    "first we checked the calculation results for the reaction @xmath46he + @xmath1ag with @xmath47 mev leading to cn @xmath48 in , for which the experiment was performed by l.g.sobotka et .",
    "for asymmetric reactions the fusion barrier which is determined by driving potential is sufficiently lower than the quasifission barrier and barrier for going to symmetric configuration . in this reaction @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and",
