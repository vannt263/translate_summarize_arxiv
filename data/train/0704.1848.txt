    "the compilations of various observational data show that the universe has entered the stage of an accelerated expansion around the redshift @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath2 of dark energy ( de ) responsible for the acceleration of the universe has been constrained to be close to @xmath0 . however , the phantom eos ( @xmath3 ) is still allowed by observations and even favored by some analyses of the data @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the eos of de crossed the cosmological constant boundary ( @xmath0 ) in relatively near past  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the phantom corresponds to the violation of weak energy condition , the property which is generally difficult to accommodate within the framework of field theory . the simplest model which realizes the phantom eos is provided by a minimally coupled scalar field with a negative kinetic term @xcite ( see also refs .",
    "the negative kinetic energy is generally problematic because it leads to a quantum instability of the vacuum in the ultraviolet ( uv ) region @xcite : the vacuum is unstable against the catastrophic particle production of ghosts and normal ( positive energy ) fields .    there have been a number of attempts to realize the phantom eos without having the pathological behaviour in the uv region .",
    "one example is scalar - tensor gravity in which a scalar field @xmath4 with a positive kinetic term is coupled to ricci scalar @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this coupling leads to the modification of gravitational constant , but it was shown in ref .",

    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the crossing of the cosmological constant boundary , @xmath0 , is possible , but local gravity experiments place rather strong constraints on the effective gb energy fraction @xcite . in addition , tensor perturbations are typically plagued by instabilities in the uv region if the gb term is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "thus , it is generally not so easy to construct viable modified gravity models that realize the phantom effective eos without violating cosmological and local gravity constraints .",
    "the third example is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model  @xcite and its extension  @xcite with a gb term in the bulk , which allow for the possibility to have @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "we show that the model has a de  sitter attractor responsible for the late - time acceleration . at early times de naturally has normal eos with @xmath17 , while the phantom eos can be realized between the matter - dominated era and the final de  sitter epoch .",
    "we clarify the conditions under which the cosmological constant boundary crossing to the phantom region occurs .",
    "interestingly , in a range of parameters this crossing takes place at the epoch when @xmath18 thus making the crossing potentially observable .",
    "another interesting feature of our model is the time - dependence of the effective newton s constant .",
    "it is naturally weak , but may well be comparable with current experimental limits",
    ". moreover , the effective newton s constant @xmath19 has a peculiar behaviour correlated with the deviation of @xmath2 from @xmath20 .",
    "we also derive momentum scales of instabilities of perturbations , first in minkowski spacetime .",

    "tachyons or ghosts appear , depending on the momentum .",

    "<S> phantom fields with negative kinetic energy are often plagued by the vacuum quantum instability in the ultraviolet region . </S>",
    "<S> we present a lorentz - violating dark energy model free from this problem and show that the crossing of the cosmological constant boundary @xmath0 to the phantom equation of state is realized before reaching a de  sitter attractor . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting feature is a peculiar time - dependence of the effective newton s constant ; the magnitude of this effect is naturally small but may be close to experimental limits . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive momentum scales of instabilities at which tachyons or ghosts appear in the infrared region around the present hubble scale and clarify the conditions under which tachyonic instabilities do not spoil homogeneity of the present / future universe . </S>"
