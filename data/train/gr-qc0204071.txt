    "the idea that our space has more than three dimensions was attractive during many years , mostly in the scenario of compactification .",
    "recently a new paradigm appeared . in this new approach",
    "the matter is trapped in three - dimensional brane embedded in a multi - dimensional space ( bulk )  @xcite . in the case of one extra dimension",
    "it is shown that isotropic cosmological evolution being unusual in early stages of the brane universe  @xcite tends to the standard cosmological scenario in the late time  @xcite .",
    "the field equations on the brane are  @xcite @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the fundamental 5-dimensional gravitational constant , @xmath10 is the effective 4-dimensional gravitation constant on the brane .",
    "bulk corrections to the einstein equations on the brane are of two forms : there are quadratic energy - momentum corrections via the tensor @xmath11 and nonlocal effects from the free gravitational field in the bulk @xmath12 .",
    "the quadratic corrections are significant only in the early stages of cosmological evolution ( see the next section ) .",
    "the nonlocal corrections can be decomposed into a scalar ( nonlocal energy density ) , a vector ( nonlocal energy flux ) and a tensor ( nonlocal anisotropic stress ) parts  @xcite . on an isotropic brane",
    "there is only a scalar part @xmath13 which decays during the expansion of the universe as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scale factor .",
    "however , if we remove the suggestion of isotropy ( for example , in order to study the problem of isotropization of the brane universe ) , then the tensor part of nonlocal contribution @xmath0 should be taken into account . the main obstacle to do this",
    "is the absence of an evolution equation for the anisotropic stress @xmath0",
    "its correct form should be derived from a full @xmath16-dimensional anisotropic metric which is still unknown . in this situation",
    "we have to choose some ansatz for @xmath0 . in first papers on bianchi",
    "i brane either all nonlocal corrections  @xcite or its tensor part  @xcite have been neglected .",
    "this approach gives some interesting results such as isotropic character of the initial singularity  @xcite and the possible existence of an intermediate anisotropic stage  @xcite .",
    "however , whether these results remain valid when the contribution from @xmath0 becomes important is still an open problem .",
    "recently barrow and maartens have proposed an ansatz for the nonlocal stress which generalizes known anisotropic sources in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "they have studied the dynamics of isotropization in the limit of small anisotropy . in the present paper",
    "we use this ansatz for describing the global properties of the dynamics .",
    "we use the techniques of dynamical systems and the expansion normalized variables ( for the description of this formalism see  @xcite ) to find the past and the future attractors of our system .",
    "the transient behavior is also covered by studying the future asymptotic states for a pure nonstandard ( i.e. with @xmath17 and without @xmath18 terms in ( 1 ) ) brane dynamics . of course",
    ", in this framework we can not find regimes originated from an interplay between standard ( proportional to @xmath18 ) and nonstandard ( proportional to @xmath17 ) source terms .",
    "up to now several interesting regimes of this type have been found ( for example , an analog of the einstein static universe  @xcite and a stable oscillationary regime  @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 .",
    "we describe the dimensionless variables and use them to write down the system of differential equations in a convenient form . in sec.3 we list stable points of this system neglecting the square energy - momentum correction and describe the future asymptotic states of the bianchi i brane model . in sec.4",
    "the stable points of the system without linear energy - momentum contribution are listed and possible transient behavior is obtained .",
    "we also discuss the past asymptotic states of our model .",
    "sec.5 provides a brief summary of the results obtained .",
    "we will use an orthonormal frame of vector fields @xmath19 such that @xmath20 . in the bianchi",
    "i case we have the following commutation relations for the vector basis ( latin indices run from 0 to 3 and greek indices from 1 to 3 ) :    @xmath21=c^{c}_{ab } { \\it e}_c\\ ] ] where    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is the angular velocity of the spatial triad with respect to a fermi - propagated frame and @xmath24 can be decomposed into a volume expansion rate @xmath25 and a shear @xmath26 :    @xmath27    if we introduce the metric for the bianchi i model in the standard form @xmath28 then the volume expansion rate in terms of the main scale factor @xmath29 is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the main hubble parameter .    for these variables we can write the raychaudhuri equation @xmath32 the gauss - codazzi equations @xmath33 and the conservation equations @xmath34 derivation of these equations from eq.(1 ) and the explicit form of @xmath17 see in  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath35 is the brane tension .",
    "quadratic energy - momentum corrections ( first terms in rhs of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 5 ) ) become significant if a matter density @xmath36 on the brane is greater than @xmath35 . the current experimental limit on the brane tension",
    "is @xmath37  @xcite .    due to presence of the nonlocal stress @xmath38 this system of equations",
    "is not closed .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to specify the form of @xmath38 using some additional suggestion . in the present paper we deal with the proposal of barrow and maartens",
    "they have suggested that the nonlocal stress is proportional to the nonlocal energy density @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42   are some constant .",
    "it is worth to notice that choosing the appropriate coordinate system we can diagonalize either @xmath38 or @xmath26 .",
    "we choose to make @xmath38 diagonal .",
    "nevertheless , our system of equations is not completely determined yet .",
    "we must fix the angular velocity @xmath23 of the spatial triad associated with @xmath38 .",
    "after that we can write the derivatives of the shear tensor as    @xmath43    in the gr description of cosmological anisotropic sources ( for example , the homogeneous magnetic field  @xcite ) the angular velocity components are constrained by the corresponding equations of motion of the anisotropic fluid ( for example , the maxwell equations in the magnetic field case ) . as we have no equation for @xmath38 , we should choose an ansatz for @xmath23 .",
    "in the present paper we consider the simplest possible form @xmath44 ( in the end of the next section one important statement not depending on @xmath23 is proved ) .",
    "after introduction of the deceleration parameter @xmath45 and dimensionless variables @xmath46 we may rewrite our system in a simpler form .",
    "we have also auxiliary evolution equation for the matter density .",
    "there are two ways for description of the quadratic energy - momentum terms .",
    "it is possible either to incorporate them into a single evolution equation for the matter as it have been done in  @xcite or to consider separately as some kind of a particular effective matter  @xcite .",
    "we choose the latter case and write two evolution equations - one for `` standard '' matter and the other for `` nonstandard '' matter . in order to do this",
    "we introduce dimensionless variables @xmath47 note that these values are not independent , they connected to each other by @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we introduce a new time variable @xmath49 such that @xmath50 .",

    "the energy density of an anisotropic matter is positive , though the nonlocal energy density on the brane can be either positive or negative and , in principal , can change sign in the cosmological evolution .",
    "however , ansatz ( 9 ) , as we can see from the first equation of system ( 13 ) prevents @xmath1 from the change of the sign .",
    "the case of negative energy of an anisotropic matter has not been investigated previously in the gr formulation due to its peculiarity from the physical point of view , but in the brane scenario it becomes important .",
    "the main feature which arises from @xmath57 is that the flat bianchi i universe can recollapse without reaching any future nonsingular asymptotic regime . from the mathematical point of view",
    "the negativity of @xmath1 makes our phase space noncompact ( the phase space , specially constracted to be compact in the @xmath57 case see in @xcite ) .",
    "so , from this point we assume @xmath58 leaving the opposite case to a future work .",
    "now our phase space becomes compact with @xmath59 varying in the range @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 varying in the range @xmath62 $ ] .    in the next section",
    "we start to analyze the system ( 13 )  ( 17 ) neglecting the `` nonstandard '' matter .",
    "all the future attractors for this system are also the future attractors for the initial general problem , because for @xmath63 we can neglect a nonstandard matter on the brane in comparison with a standard one .",
    "now we list equilibrium points for the system ( 13 )  ( 17 ) in the case @xmath64 .",
    "it is convenient to use the notations @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we also have found the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath67 of the linearization of system ( 13 ) about the equilibrium points and have used the condition @xmath68 to study the stability of the equilibrium points in the future direction .    1 .   the isotropic universe @xmath69 stable for @xmath70 independently on @xmath71 .",
    "equilibrium point @xmath72 stable for @xmath73 .",
    "equilibrium point @xmath74 stable for @xmath75 .",
    "4 .   equilibrium set ( the kasner universe ) @xmath76    the results on stability of the equilibrium points are presented graphically in fig.1 .",
    "the space @xmath77 is divided into several zones in which only one stable future attractor exists .",
    "we can see that the only stable point for @xmath70 is the isotropic one , independently on @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is possible to strengthen this result and prove that all the solutions with @xmath80 and @xmath4 tend to the isotropic solution ( @xmath81 is an invariant subset of our phase space , as it can be seen from eq .",
    "we point out that a physically important boundary case @xmath82 is included in the conditions of this statement .",
    "the key point is the equation @xmath83\\omega_{\\mu}\\ ] ] which can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( 14 )  ( 16 ) .",
    "note , that eq.(19 ) follows only from the raychaudhuri and constraint equations and we do not use the evolution equations for the shear .",
    "this means that the consideration presented below does not depend on a particular choice of the angular velocity @xmath23 .",
    "first , consider the case @xmath84 then there is a positive number @xmath85 such that @xmath86\\omega_{\\mu}.\\ ] ] from this inequality it follows that the quantity @xmath87 is strictly increasing if @xmath88 using this fact and the constraint @xmath89 one can easily understand that the sum @xmath90 in turn , strictly decreases . as decreasing and bounded below by zero ,",
    "this sum has some limit @xmath91 .",
    "assume that @xmath92 is not equal to zero .",
    "then , the quantity @xmath87 goes to infinity : @xmath93 which contradicts the inequality @xmath94 .",
    "thus , for any initial conditions satisfying @xmath95 the solution tends to the point @xmath96    in the boundary case @xmath82 it is necessary to be more careful .",
    "for @xmath97 we have @xmath98",
    "so , @xmath87 is monotone increasing and , then , tends to some limit value @xmath99 .",
    "assume that @xmath100 .",
    "using the constraint ( 14 ) and the evolution equations for @xmath101 and @xmath87 , we obtain the evolution equation for @xmath102 : @xmath103 in sequel , we shell use only the fact that the absolute value of the lhs of this equation is bounded above : @xmath104 for all @xmath49 . now assume that @xmath105 does not tend to zero .",
    "then there is a sequence @xmath106 going to infinity such that @xmath107 for some @xmath108 but the boundedness of the shear square derivative means that there is a positive @xmath109 which does not depend on @xmath110 such that @xmath111 for @xmath112 and all @xmath113 in this case from equation ( 20 ) it follows that the quantity @xmath87 goes to infinity : @xmath114 this fact contradicts the inequality @xmath94 .",
    "thus , @xmath105 tends to zero . by the constraint @xmath115 this means that the quantity @xmath101 converges to @xmath116 but it is impossible because the point @xmath117 and @xmath118 is not an equilibrium point of our system for nonzero @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 goes to @xmath119 and both @xmath101 and @xmath105 decrease to zero .    for the brane problem",
    "this means that if @xmath120 satisfies the ansatz ( 9 ) with @xmath58 , then an arbitrary anisotropy of the whole 5-dimensional metric does not destroy the future isotropic regime unless @xmath121 .",
    "it is interesting that in the case of @xmath97 without an anisotropic stress we have a one - dimensional set of equilibria instead of the isotropic equilibrium point .",
    "points of this set have @xmath122 and are marked by the constant ratio @xmath123 .",
    "a nonzero @xmath0 makes all these points except for @xmath124 unstable . as a result , in the presense of a nonlocal anisotropic stress",
    "the `` dark energy '' @xmath1 can be washed out during the cosmological evolution even in the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "we finish this section by one remark which is not directly connected with the brane cosmology . as we consider the case of @xmath64 , the system of equations ( 13 )  ( 16 ) with barrow - maartens ansatz for @xmath0 has the same form ( with appropriate rescaling of source terms ) as the system describing the evolution of the universe in the presence of an anisotropic matter in the ordinary general relativity .",
    "since our result on isotropisation does not depend on angular velocity @xmath23 ( these values should be determined separately for each particular anisotropic source ) , we can claim that in the presence of an anisotropic matter with an anisotropic stress @xmath125 proportional to its energy density @xmath126 and an average pressure @xmath127 equals to @xmath128 all the models isotropize if @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we can consider an anisotropic matter with an average pressure @xmath129 and , using the same procedure , claim that all such models with @xmath130 tend to the isotropic attractor .",
    "this fact was previously discovered in the particular case of the homogeneous magnetic field @xcite and for the general source in the limit of a small anisotropy @xcite ( the `` criticality condition '' of ref .",
    "@xcite is exactly @xmath131 in our notation ) .",
    "in this section we neglecte the standard matter on a brane . this case describes a purely nonstandard brane dynamics when the matter density on the brane is large in comparison with the brane tension .",
    "the past asymptotic states of these models correspond to a brane dynamics near a singularity , future asymptotic states describe some intermediate regime of the brane universe when a nonstandard asymptotic behavior have already been established but the matter density is still larger than the brane tension .",

    "for @xmath145 we can see a complete analogy with fig.1 if @xmath146 is divided by 2 .",

    ".    anisotropic brane attractors may naturally appear in the inflationary brane scenario if the transition from nonstandard dynamics to standard one occurs at some moment after the inflation . during the nonstandard brane phase the condition for inflation is @xmath155 @xcite , after the end of the inflation the parameter @xmath146 grows to @xmath156 in typical models . in this case",
    "the brane universe evolves consecutively from one stable regime to another one according to a corresponding @xmath78=const , @xmath79=const line in fig.2 .",
    "when the pressure becomes positive ( @xmath149 ) , the universe finally reaches one of the two possible attractors depending on the parameters @xmath157 and stays in this regime until the matter density on the brane drops below the brane tension and the transition to the standard regime occurs .    near the initial singularity the nonstandard matter on the brane dominates and we can put the standard matter density @xmath81 . as we now consider the backward time direction ,",
    "the condition for the stability of the equilibrium points becomes @xmath158 .",
    "the results are follows .    for the kasner set two nonzero eigenvalues",
    "are @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "four other eigenvalues are equal to zero .",
    "this indicates that we have a four - dimensional set of equilibria .",
    "the second nonzero eigenvalue is positive on some subset of the kasner set and this subset exists for arbitrary @xmath161 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath162 is positive only for @xmath145 .",
    "so , the condition for stability of the kasner solution in the past is @xmath163 independently on @xmath161 .    in the opposite case @xmath164 ( a matter with a positive pressure )",
    "a stable solution in the past direction is the isotropic universe .",
    "this result appears only in the brane scenario . in the case of @xmath165",
    "the isotropic character of a brane cosmological singularity in the presence of matter with a positive pressure has been found earlier by several authors @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the bianchi i cosmological dynamics on a brane in the presence of a nonlocal anisotropic stress @xmath0 satisfying the barrow - maartens ansatz ( 9 ) with @xmath58 .",
    "the dynamics appears to be more complicated in comparison with the previously known case of @xmath165 .",
    "however , we can mention two important regimes not modified by the anisotropic stress of the form studied in this paper :    * if @xmath166 the anisotropic stress does not prevent the bianchi i model from isotropization . using the existence of a monotonic function ( 19 ) we can prove that all such models isotropize . * the anisotropic stress does not alter the past asymptotic state which is the isotropic universe for @xmath164 and the kasner solution for @xmath167 .",
    "we also describe the set of future asymptotic states in the case @xmath168 and possible transient brane dynamics which can exist before the linear energy - momentum contribution in the effective einstein equations becomes important .",
    "an important problem for the future development is to consider the @xmath57 case .",
