    "<S> we have analyzed the _ ab - initio _ local density approximation band structure calculations for the family of perovskite oxides , la@xmath0o@xmath1 with @xmath0=ti - ni within a parametrized nearest neighbor tight - binding model and extracted various interaction strengths . </S>",
    "<S> we study the systematics in these interaction parameters across the transition metal series and discuss the relevance of these in a many - body description of these oxides . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained here compare well with estimates of these parameters obtained via analysis of electron spectroscopic results in conjunction with the anderson impurity model . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the hopping interaction strength , @xmath2 , is found to be approximately @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1@xmath4#1    * introduction *    electronic structures of transition metal oxides have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years , arising from their unusual electronic and magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneous presence of strong electron - electron interaction within the transition metal 3@xmath5 manifold and a sizeable hopping interaction strength between the 3@xmath5 and oxygen 2@xmath6 states is primarily responsible for the wide range of properties exhibited by these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> often the presence of a strong intraatomic coulomb interaction strength makes a single - particle description of such systems inadequate , necessitating a model many - body hamiltonian approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such parametrized approaches require a prior knowledge of the various electronic interaction strengths , such as the intraatomic coulomb interaction strength , @xmath7 , the charge - transfer energy , @xmath8 , and the metal @xmath5-oxygen @xmath6 hopping interaction strength , @xmath2 , in order to provide a description of the ground state electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> traditionally , various high - energy spectroscopic results in conjuction with model hamiltonian calculations have provided estimates for such interaction strengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well - known that wide ranges of parameter values are compatible with experimentally obtained spectra , leading to non - unique solutions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the fact that the effect of a change in one parameter on the calculated spectrum can often be compensated by suitably changing another parameter , such that the the various solutions are indistinguishable within experimental uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has given rise to different sets of estimates of interaction parameters from different groups for the same compound . </S>",
    "<S> in this context , it is highly desirable to obtain independent estimates of various interaction strengths from methods other than those using spectroscopic results . </S>",
    "<S> even if only one interaction strength can be reliably estimated from any other method , the problem of non - uniqueness in analysing experimental spectroscopic result is considerably eliminated and such an approach will yield a more consistent description of the electronic structure .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we have shown @xcite that the electronic and magnetic structures of a particular class of transition metal oxides , namely the 3@xmath5 transition metal perovskite oxides of the general formula la@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath0=cr - ni ) are described very accurately within _ ab - initio _ approaches based on local density approximation ( lda ) . </S>",
    "<S> futhermore , it is also seen that the various excitation spectra , such as x - ray photoemission ( xp ) spectra of the valence band region and bremsstrahlung isochromat ( bi ) spectra of these compounds are also described well within the band structure approach . </S>",
    "<S> this success suggests that such band structure results could be useful in providing reliable estimates of various interaction strengths in this interesting class of compounds which have attracted a lot of attention in recent times @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of various interaction strengths based on _ ab - initio _ calculations have indeed been carried out in the past , for example for the 3@xmath5 transition metal monoxide series @xcite , la@xmath9nio@xmath10 @xcite , la@xmath9cuo@xmath10 @xcite , the 4@xmath5 transition metal oxide , sr@xmath9ruo@xmath10 @xcite and mn doped cdte @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we report here the results of our analysis for the entire series of compounds belonging to the la@xmath0o@xmath1 family with @xmath0=ti - ni . wherever possible </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the results obtained from the present approach with those obtained by analysis of various spectroscopic results already existent .    </S>",
    "<S> * methodology *    we have performed detailed band structure calculations within the linearised muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method using the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin restricted calculations were performed for the real crystal structures experimentally observed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no attempt has been made to determine the lattice constants from total energy calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this is justified in the present context , since our primary aim here is to obtain strengths of the electronic interactions in the real systems with the observed lattice constants . in the case of lacoo@xmath1 , however , we have performed calculations for various values of the lattice parameter in order to deduce the dependence of the hopping interaction strengths on distances . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of these results shows that the present method predicts the lattice parameters with nearly 1% accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> latio@xmath1 @xcite , lavo@xmath1 @xcite , lacro@xmath1 @xcite and lafeo@xmath1 @xcite in the observed pbnm structure were calculated with twenty atoms in the unit cell , while lacoo@xmath1 @xcite and lanio@xmath1 @xcite calculations were performed with ten atoms in the unit cell in the real r@xmath11c structure . in the case of lamno@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the real crystal structure is pnma stabilised by a jahn - teller distortion around the mn - ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to all other la@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds , this leads to a distorted octahedra of oxygens with two distinct mn - o distances . since </S>",
    "<S> , this would introduce additional parameters in the analysis , we have preferred to calculate the band structure of lamno@xmath1 with an earlier reported r@xmath11c idealised structure , where the jahn - teller distortion is suppressed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such approximations have been made in the past @xcite and we do not expect to introduce any significant error in the parameters obtained , since the change in the interaction parameters is expected to be small for the small distortions observed .    </S>",
    "<S> various interaction strengths can be estimated by mapping the band dispersions obtained from a parametrized tight - binding model onto those from _ </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio _ band calculations @xcite . since , we are primarily interested in the states arising from transition metal @xmath5-oxygen @xmath6 interaction which dominate the occupied density of states as well as parts of the unoccupied states near the fermi energy , e@xmath12 , the tight - binding hamiltonian consists of the bare energies of the transition metal @xmath5 ( @xmath13 ) and oxygen @xmath6 ( @xmath14 ) states and hopping interactions between all these states . </S>",
    "<S> the nearest neighbor hopping interactions were expressed in terms of four slater - koster parameters , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is further necessary @xcite to include an interaction , @xmath19 , between the transition metal @xmath5 and oxygen @xmath20 states in order to simulate the splitting between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states at the @xmath23 point , since the degeneracy of these two states is not lifted by the @xmath24 interaction at this symmetry point . in general , it is also necessary to include the effect of non - orthogonality of atomic functions located at different sites by considering the overlap matrix in such tight - binding approaches@xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the tight - binding part of any parametrised many - body hamiltonian , such as the hubbard hamiltonian , ignores the overlap matrix with an assumption of orthogonality of the basis functions . </S>",
    "<S> since we are eventually interested in obtaining estimates of interaction strengths that enter such many - body hamiltonians as parameters , we have carried out the fitting of the lmto dispersions within two separate tight - binding models , one with and the other without the assumption of orthonormal basis functions .    </S>",
    "<S> since we take into account only the transition metal @xmath5 and oxygen @xmath6 states , there are 56 bands to be fitted in the pbnm structure and 28 bands in the r@xmath11c structure . </S>",
    "<S> lmto - asa results indicate that several of the low - lying bands within the nominal oxygen @xmath6-bandwidth have non - negligible contributions from la derived states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have not taken into account some of these bands in the fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we included the top 38 bands in the case of the pbnm structure and 19 in the r@xmath11c structure . in the case of latio@xmath1 , the top 8 bands with mainly ti @xmath5 character overlap extensively with other bands having primarily la character . </S>",
    "<S> thus we could not include these bands in the fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we also checked the effect of including only the primarily transition metal @xmath5-derived bands , ( top 20 in pbnm and 10 in r@xmath11c structures ) , leaving out all the primarily oxygen @xmath6-derived bands , from the fitting procedures . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of latio@xmath1 we have not carried out such an analysis due to the extensive overlap of ti @xmath5 and la derived bands mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> results of these different procedures , namely assuming the orthogonality or non - orthogonality of the atomic basis functions and employing different limited sets of bands , are consistent with each other .    </S>",
    "<S> * results and discussion *    total density of states as well as partial densities of mn @xmath5 and o @xmath6 states in lamno@xmath1 states obtained from lmto - asa calculations are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . we show the corresponding band dispersions along various symmetry directions in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> the zero of the energy scale corresponds to the fermi energy , e@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> a set of two bands can be seen close to 3 ev at the @xmath23 point and dispersing to higher energies along both @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions , becoming larger than 4 ev halfway to the zone boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> these two bands are primarily la derived with negligible mn @xmath5 contributions ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) and we do not discuss these any further here . </S>",
    "<S> next , one can observe a group of four strongly dispersing bands in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a between about 0.5 and 3.5 ev giving rise to the approximately rectangular dos marked a in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> these bands are derived primarily from mn @xmath5(@xmath27)-oxygen @xmath6-admixture with dominant mn @xmath5 character . </S>",
    "<S> below the @xmath27 bands , there is a group of 6 bands spread between -1 and 0.5 ev with considerably less dispersion than the @xmath27 bands ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) giving rise to a narrow dos marked b in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . various partial densities of states in this energy range suggest that this group has primarily mn @xmath5 character with some finite oxygen @xmath6 admixture ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . from these observations </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that this group of bands arises mainly from mn @xmath5 ( @xmath21 ) states . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath27 and @xmath21 bands discussed so far arise from mn @xmath5-oxygen @xmath6 antibonding combination , with dominant mn @xmath5 character . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these bands are termed antibonding @xmath28 and @xmath29 bands respectively . at still lower energies </S>",
    "<S> , we find an energy region with dos between about -2.7 and -4.5 ev which is almost completely contributed by oxygen @xmath6-character with very small mn @xmath5 character . </S>",
    "<S> these features in the dos are marked as c in fig . 1 and arise from essentially oxygen - oxygen interactions with a non - bonding character with respect to mn @xmath5- o @xmath6 interactions </S>",
    "<S> . the corresponding dispersions of the eight bands can be observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> dispersions of the remaining ten bands can be seen between -4 and -7.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding density of states ( marked d ) peaks at about -5.5 ev and has primarily oxygen @xmath6-character ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . however , finite mn @xmath5 admixture is also observable in this energy range . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these states arise from oxygen @xmath6-mn @xmath5 bonding interactions and are the bonding counterparts of the mn @xmath5-dominated antibonding @xmath30 and t@xmath31 bands at higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> these interpretations are consistent with the description of bonding in la@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds which have been discussed in detail in recent times @xcite .    in order to map the band dispersions obtained from lmto - asa calculations onto the tight - binding model </S>",
    "<S> , we have used all the ten primarily mn @xmath5-derived @xmath30 and @xmath32 bands as well as the top nine oxygen @xmath6-bands , as explained in the previous section . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit tight - binding dispersions are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b for comparison with the _ ab - initio _ calculated dispersions in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 that good agreement is obtained between the lmto and tight - binding results ; this is particularly true of the bands related to the @xmath32 and @xmath30 distributed between -1 and 3.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is significant , since the lower bands related primarily to oxygen @xmath6-states are completely filled in all these oxides and the electronic and magnetic properties in these cases are controlled entirely by the @xmath32 and @xmath30 bands . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the present result suggests that the electronic structure of these transition metal oxides can be well described in terms of models involving only the transition metal @xmath5 and oxygen @xmath6 states ( i.e @xmath33 models ) , as is the usual procedure .    </S>",
    "<S> while the above mentioned case of lamno@xmath1 was calculated within the r@xmath11c structure , we show an example of lmto - asa dos and band dispersions for the pbnm structure in figs . 3 and 4a respectively for lafeo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> once again , four groups of dos features are easily identified in fig . 3 for lafeo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these are marked a through d and have the same origin as discussed in the case of lamno@xmath1 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . in the case of the pbnm structure of lafeo@xmath1 however , there are twenty atoms in the unit cell , thereby doubling the number of bands in comparison with the previously discussed r@xmath11c structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , within the @xmath33 part of the electronic structure alone , there are fifty - six bands ; eight related to the @xmath30 bands , twelve to the @xmath32 bands , sixteen related to the so - called non - bonding oxygen @xmath6-parts and twenty related to the bonding states of the fe @xmath5-o @xmath6 interactions . for the sake of clarity , we show the dispersions of those bands which are related to the @xmath30 and @xmath32 bands with primarily fe @xmath5 character along various symmetry directions in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a . </S>",
    "<S> the strongly dispersing group of eight bands ( more easily recognisable along the @xmath34 direction ) between about 0.5 ev and 3 ev arise from the @xmath30 bands , while the considerably more flat twelve bands between -1 and 0.5 ev comprise the @xmath32 region . </S>",
    "<S> these band dispersions alongwith the sixteen non - bonding oxygen @xmath6 bands were fitted with @xmath33 only tight - binding model along all symmetry directions in the same way as in the case of lamno@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting best fit tight - binding results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4a and b indicate that the @xmath33 only nearest neighbor tight - binding model describes the band dispersions observed within the _ ab - initio _ calculation quite well .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameters for the best fits to the lmto band dispersions for all the la@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds with @xmath0=ti - ni are given in table i. while the main entries in this table are for the cases where @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands were fitted , the numbers in parentheses are obtained by fitting only the @xmath30 and @xmath32 bands . </S>",
    "<S> these two sets of estimates are very similar exhibiting some systematic changes across the transition metal series . </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the strengths of various hopping interactions across the 3@xmath5 transition metal series in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to expect that the variations in the hopping interactionwill be related to the changes in the relevant atomic distances . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have also shown the experimentally observed oxygen - oxygen ( @xmath35 ) and the metal - oxygen ( @xmath36 ) distances in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 . both @xmath35 and @xmath36 appear to be larger in lafeo@xmath1 compared to the overall trend . </S>",
    "<S> this may arise from the stability of the half - filled high - spin @xmath37 ionic configuration of fe@xmath38 in this compound . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease of these distances for lacoo@xmath1 , just after lafeo@xmath1 , is clearly related to the low - spin configuration of the co@xmath38 ion . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 shows that the magnitude of @xmath15 does not show any significant variations between v and mn , then decreases for fe followed by a substantial increase for co. these variations in @xmath15 strength can be easily related to the changes in the nearest neighbour oxygen - oxygen distances ( r@xmath39 ) in the la@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds ; r@xmath39 substantially increases for lafeo@xmath1 giving rise to the observed decrease in @xmath15 in this compound . for lacoo@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , r@xmath39 is seen to be the smallest in the la@xmath0o@xmath1 series and for latio@xmath1 , @xmath35 is the largest ; consequently the corresponding strengths of @xmath15 are the largest and the smallest respectively in the series . </S>",
    "<S> various transition metal @xmath5-oxygen orbital interactions , namely @xmath40 and @xmath18 also exhibit systematic variations across the series , the qualitative behaviour of these three interactions being quite similar to each other ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions , besides being influenced by the transition metal - oxygen distance ( r@xmath41 ) shown in the inset , are also influenced by the spatial extent of the transition metal @xmath5 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the @xmath5-orbitals contract across the transition metal series . thus , the decreasing trends in the hopping interaction strengths between the transition metal @xmath5 and oxygen orbitals between ti and mn , inspite of a small decrease in r@xmath41 arise from the @xmath5-orbital contraction across the series . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the interaction strengths are larger for lacoo@xmath1 than lafeo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly related to the pronounced decrease of r@xmath41 between lafeo@xmath1 and lacoo@xmath1 , associated with the low - spin configuration in lacoo@xmath1 in contrast to the high - spin configuration in all the other la@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds with @xmath0=ti - fe .    besides the various hopping interaction strengths , the bare energy difference , ( @xmath42 ) , between the transition metal @xmath5 and oxygen @xmath6 orbitals exhibits a monotonic decrease across the la@xmath0o@xmath1 series , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 . </S>",
    "<S> this is indeed the expected trend , since the transition metal @xmath5 level is increasingly stablized with respect to the oxygen @xmath6-orbital due to the increasing nuclear potential with increasing atomic number of the transition metal ion .    </S>",
    "<S> the results summarized in table i and figs . 5 and 6 are obtained by fitting the lmto band dispersions to the results of the tight - binding model with finite overlap between the orbitals at different atomic sites . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of the model many - body hamiltonian approaches assume an orthogonal basis set ; thus , the results in table i can not be directly used to estimate the parameter strengths appearing in such models . in order to provide estimates for such interaction strengths that parametrize the many - body calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we have also fitted the lmto band dispersions with the results of a tight - binding hamiltonian assuming an orthogonal basis . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the tight - binding model corresponds to the one - electron part of the multiband hubbard model involving all the transition metal @xmath5 and oxygen @xmath6 orbitals , suitable for the la@xmath0o@xmath1 series . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting estimates of the various interaction strengths corresponding to the best simulation of lmto band dispersions are given in table ii . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of tables i and ii show that the estimates of various parameters are quite similar in the two cases , justifying the assumption of an orthogonal basis in describing the electronic structures of these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> this is further supported by the fact that the orbital overlaps required to optimize the simulation of lmto band dispersions are generally very small . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the parameter values summarized in table ii exhibit similar systematic trends across the transition metal series as those in table i ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) .    in order to verify the relevance of the interaction parameters thus estimated </S>",
    "<S> , we note that there have been several attempts in the past to estimate many of these from various high - energy spectroscopic results in conjunction with different many - body approaches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that such estimates are often non - unique @xcite ; however it is believed that in particular , various hopping interaction strengths can be estimated with a fair degree of accuracy from such approaches . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we compare the estimates of the transition metal @xmath5- oxygen @xmath6 interaction , @xmath17 obtained from high - energy spectroscopy and the present approach . </S>",
    "<S> two different groups have systematically worked on obtaining these experimental estimates for la@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 7 , we have plotted the experimentally obtained estimates of @xmath17 from the tokyo group @xcite and the bangalore group @xcite against the estimates obtained in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> we show the results from these two groups using different symbols ; we have drawn two broken lines as guides to the eye for the average overall variation of @xmath17 across the series , as obtained by each of the two groups . the solid line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 7 with a unity slope and no intercept , represents the behaviour of @xmath17 , if the experimental estimates and the present estimates were identical in every case . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the experimental estimates are somewhat different from the calculated ones . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that the average variations of @xmath17 across the series obtained by these groups are very similar to that suggested by the present calculations ; this is indicated by the fact that the broken lines representing the average variation of experimentally obtained @xmath17 are approximately parallel to the solid line within the accuracy of experimental estimates . moreover , while the estimate of @xmath17 from one group is higher than the calculated ones , the estimate from the other is consistently lower . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from the non - uniqueness of the parameter strengths estimated from experimental results discussed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , it is obvious that @xmath17 values estimated in the present work are also compatible with the high - energy spectroscopic data , since values both larger and smaller than the calculated values provide satisfactory description of the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is desirable to constrain the strength of @xmath17 to the values calculated here on the basis of _ ab - initio _ approaches ; this will avoid the problem of non - uniqueness normally encountered in such analysis @xcite and will help in obtaining considerably better defined estimates of other parameters in the model .    </S>",
    "<S> the estimates of @xmath43 obtained by analysing the lmto results can be related in an approximate way to the charge transfer energy , @xmath8 defined @xcite within the anderson impurity hamiltonian which is often used to provide a many - body description of the electronic structure of these oxides . for this , we first note that the eigen values , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in an lda calculation are not directly related to the orbital ionization energies . in order to see the relationship between the charge transfer energy and the eigen values , we note that the total energy @xmath44 within the lda calculation can be expressed as a taylor series expansion in terms of the electron occupancies , @xmath45 , of the various levels @xmath46 : @xmath47 retaining terms upto the second order in the above expansion , it is easy to show @xcite that the coefficients @xmath48 s are related to various electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the atomic orbital eigen value @xmath49 of the level @xmath46 is related @xcite to the total energy as @xmath50+b_i\\ ] ] then the charge transfer energy , @xmath8 , defined as @xmath51 is readily given by @xmath52 thus , @xmath53 and the difference in the orbital eigen values , @xmath43 are linearly related with the difference being half of the intraatomic coulomb strength within the 3@xmath5 electrons . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 8 , we have plotted the values of @xmath8 obtained from various high energy spectroscopic results as a function of the orbital energy difference , @xmath43 , calculated in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> the straight line with a unity slope represents the expected dependence of @xmath8 on @xmath43 in absence of coulomb interaction . with the sole exception of the case of v , all experimental estimates of @xmath8 is larger than that represented by the straight line ; this clearly indicates the presence of finite coulomb interaction strengths in all these cases . </S>",
    "<S> we however would not like to estimate @xmath7 from the difference between the experimentally estimated @xmath8 values and the value ( represented by the straight line in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 8) expected in absence of @xmath7 , since the uncertainty in estimating @xmath8 from experiment can be very large ( as large as @xmath54 2 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is also possibly the reason why the @xmath8 value in the case of the vanadium compound has been estimated lower than the straight line . </S>",
    "<S> the present results suggest that the estimate of @xmath43 in this work can be used to guide the choice for @xmath8 via the equation 1 . </S>",
    "<S> essentially , equation 1 gives a relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath7 , since @xmath43 is estimated here , this leaves only one parameter ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) to be determined from experimental results .    on many occassions , it is desirable to know how @xmath17 changes with the distance between the transition metal and the oxygen atom in a compound . </S>",
    "<S> this may be very useful in describing the electronic structure of any compound under pressure , or in the case of compounds , such as lamno@xmath1 , where various transition metal - oxygen distances are observed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there have been many attempts to express the functional dependence between @xmath17 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown earlier that the interatomic matrix - elements are supposed to scale with distance as 1/@xmath55 @xcite , where l and l@xmath56 are the angular momenta of the orbitals involved . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for @xmath24 interactions , the matrix elements scale as 1/@xmath57 . in order to obtain an _ ab - initio _ estimate of the functional dependence , we have calculated the band structure of lacoo@xmath1 with different lattice parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the different sets of band dispersions have been analysed in terms of the same tight - binding hamiltonian with overlap included . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters in each case were obtained by the previously discussed least - squared error fitting procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the @xmath17 thus obtained as a function of @xmath58 for the eight different calculations in a log@xmath59-log@xmath59 plot . </S>",
