    "the normalization amplitude of the linear matter power spectrum is one of the key cosmological parameters that are required to complete the theoretical description of the initial conditions of the universe @xcite .",
    "it is often quantified in terms of @xmath2 , the rms fluctuations of the linear density field within a top - hat spherical radius @xmath3mpc .",
    "various observables have so far been used to constrain the value of @xmath2 : the cluster abundance ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the weak lensing cosmic shear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strong lensing arc statistics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cluster shapes @xcite , and the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) temperature map ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , these observables depend not solely on @xmath2 but concurrently on the other key parameters such as the matter density parameter @xmath4 , primordial non - gaussianity parameter @xmath5 , and dark energy equation of state @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , it has been realized that complicated systematics involved in the measurement of these observables could bias strongly the estimates of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , to break the parameter degeneracy and to diminish any systematic bias , it is very important to consider as many alternative probes as possible .",
    "recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , pl07 ) have proposed the void ellipticity function as another sensitive probe of @xmath2 . noting that the shapes of voids are modulated by the competition between tidal distortion and cosmic expansion",
    ", they have analytically derived the void ellipticity function under the assumption that the dynamics of void galaxies can be well described by the zeldovich approximation just as that of the dark matter particles are in the linear regime .",
    "they have tested their model against the results from the millennium run simulations @xcite , which proved the validity of the pl07 model . for the comparison with observational data",
    ", however , the pl07 model has to be extended to incorporate the redshift distortion effect since in pratice the void ellipticities can be measured only in redshift space .",
    "moreover , there is one condition that the success of the pl07 analytic model is contingent upon .",
    "its validity has been tested only for the case that the voids are found through the specific void - finding algorithm of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hv02 ) .",
    "since there is no unique definition of voids , the ellipticity distribution may well depend on the way in which voids are identified @xcite .",
    "for the fair comparison with the pl07 model , the hv02 algorithm should be consistently used for the identification of voids from observations . very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fn09 ) have constructed a catalog of @xmath7 voids from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 ( sdss dr5 ) .",
    "now that the voids of the fn09 catalog are identified using the hv02 algorithm , it must provide the most optimal dataset against which the pl07 analytic model can be compared .    in this letter",
    "our goal is to constrain the value of @xmath2 by comparing the extended pl07 analytic model of the redshifted void ellipticity function with the observational result from the fn07 catalog of sdss voids .",
    "let us first give a brief overview on the pl07 theoretical model .",
    "an analytic expression for the probability density distribution of the minor - to - major axial ratio , @xmath8 , of a void at redshift @xmath9 on the lagrangian scale @xmath10 was found by pl07 as @xmath11 \\cr & = & \\int_{\\nu}^{1}d\\mu   \\frac{3375\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{10\\pi}\\sigma^{5}_{r_l } } \\exp\\left[-\\frac{5\\delta^{2}_{v}}{2\\sigma^{2}_{r_l } } +   \\frac{15\\delta_{v}(\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2})}{2\\sigma^{2}_{r_l}}\\right ] \\cr & & \\times\\exp\\left[-\\frac{15(\\lambda^{2}_{1}+\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}+ \\lambda^{2}_{2})}{2\\sigma^{2}_{r_l}}\\right ] \\cr & & \\times(2\\lambda_{1}+\\lambda_{2}-\\delta_{v})(\\lambda_{1}-\\lambda_{2 } ) ( \\lambda_{1}+2\\lambda_{2}-\\delta_{v } ) \\cr & & \\times\\frac{4(\\delta_{v}-3)^2\\mu\\nu}{(\\mu^{2}+\\nu^{2}+1)^{3 } } ,   \\label{eqn : nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 represents the rms fluctuations of the linear density field smoothed on scale @xmath10 at redshift @xmath9 , and @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) represent the two axial ratios of cosmic voids that can be obtained from the inertia momentum tensors of the anisotropic spatial positions of void galaxies .",
    "the key concept of this analytic expression is that the two axial ratios , @xmath8 and @xmath15 , are related to the largest and second to the largest eigenvalues , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , of the tidal field smoothed on the scale @xmath10 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the critical density contrast of a void linearly extrapolated to @xmath20 .",
    "pl07 calculated the value of @xmath19 as the galaxy number density contrast as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the number density of void galaxies and the mean number density of all galaxies in a given sample .",

    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath26 have to be determined from the observed voids that are to be used for comparison .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that this relation between @xmath10 and @xmath26 holds good also in redshift space .    defining the ellipticity of a void as @xmath29 , the probability density distribution of the void ellipticities on scale @xmath10 at redshift @xmath9",

    "pl07 originally derived equations ( [ eqn : nu]-[eqn : lamu2 ] ) for the present epoch @xmath20 .",
    "it was @xcite who extended the analytic model to higher redshifts , according to which the dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath9 and @xmath10 comes from the dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the top - hat filter of scale radius @xmath10 , @xmath35 is the linear growth factor normalized as @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the dimensionless linear matter power spectrum .",

    "the lagrangian void scale , redshift , and total number of voids are set at the values consistent with the ones used for the void catalog ( see  3 ) .",
    "as it can be seen , the void ellipticity function depends very sensitively on the @xmath2 value .",
    "fn09 extended the hv02 void - finding algorithm to improve its statistical robustness and applied it to the volume - limited spectroscopic sample of the galaxies from sdss dr5 to construct a catalog of @xmath7 voids ( available at http://physics.ubishops.ca/sdssvoids ) .",
    "the volume limited sample has a total of @xmath57 galaxies in a volume of @xmath58 ( c. foster in private communication ) .",

    "the effective spherical radius @xmath26 of each void is related to its three axis - lengths as @xmath64 .",
    "fn09 determined the best - fit ellipsoid of each void with the help of the prescription of @xcite , assuming a flat @xmath38cdm cosmology with @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . throughout this paper",
    ", we also adopt the same cosmology , setting the other key parameters at @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the wmap priors @xcite .",
    "the mean values of @xmath9 , @xmath26 , and @xmath61 averaged over all voids are found to be @xmath70 , @xmath71mpc , and @xmath72 , respectively .    using information on @xmath62",
    ", we measure the ellipticity of each void as @xmath73 . binning the ellipticities as @xmath74 , counting the number of sdss voids in each ellipticity bin , and dividing the void number counts by @xmath75",
    ", we determine the observational void ellipticity function , @xmath76 . to estimate the statistical errors in the measurement of @xmath76",
    ", we separate the voids into six subsamples each of which has approximately the same number of voids , and then calculate the void ellipticity function separately from each subsample . the errors at each ellipticity bin @xmath74 is now calculated as the standard deviation of @xmath77 between the six subsamples , which include both the cosmic variance and the poisson noise .",
    "figure [ fig : com ] plots the resulting void ellipticity function as dots .",
    "the density contrast of each void is computed as @xmath78 where @xmath79 with @xmath80 . and",
    "the mean density contrast averaged over all voids is determined to be @xmath81 . using the values of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ,",
    "the lagrangian void scale is obtained to be @xmath85mpc .",
    "we fit the analytic model of the redshifted void ellipticity function to the observational results by adjusting the value of @xmath2 with the help of the generalized @xmath0 minimization method where @xmath0 is given as @xmath86c^{-1}_{ij } [ f^{o}_{s}(\\varepsilon_{j})-f^{t}_{s}(\\varepsilon_{j};\\sigma_{8})],\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the observed and the theoretical ellipticity function at the @xmath89-th ellipticity bin , respectively .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath90 is defined as @xmath91 where the ensemble average is taken over the six subsamples .",
    "since the number of the subsamples ( six ) is larger than the number of the ellipticity bins ( five ) , it is guaranteed that @xmath90 is invertible @xcite .",
    "the best - fit @xmath2 that minimizes @xmath0 is found to be @xmath92 where the errors are calculated as @xmath93 .",
    "figure [ fig : com ] plots the analytic model with best - fit @xmath2 , demonstrating that the analytic model agrees well with the observational results .",
    "although a fixed value , @xmath65 , is assumed for the construction of the fn09 void catalog , it is worth examining the parameter degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath4 when the void ellipticity function is used as a probe of @xmath2 .",
    "varying the values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 simultaneously , we repeat the whole fitting process .",
    "figure [ fig : con ] plots the contours of @xmath94 ( thick solid , thin solid and dotted lines , respectively ) in the @xmath95 plane , where @xmath96 is the reduced @xmath0 .",
    "as it can be seen , the best - fit @xmath2 decreases very mildly as @xmath4 increases .",
    "we have constrained the matter power spectrum normalization as @xmath1 by comparing the void ellipticity function from sdss dr5 with the extended pl07 model .",
    "it is intriguing to note that our result is higher than the wmap5 value ( @xmath97 ) but consistent with that from the recent work of @xcite who casted a doubt on the accuracy of the cosmological parameters estimated by the wmap team . using a new improved cmb map constructed by employing an independent software scheme , @xcite have found @xmath98 .",
    "the advantage of using the void ellipticity function as a probe of the power spectrum normalization is that it is purely analytical , free from any nuisance parameters and ad - hoc assumptions .",
    "besides , as shown recently by @xcite , the void ellipticity function does not depend on the primordial non - gaussianity parameter , unlike the other prominent probe of @xmath2 , the cluster mass function .",
    "it depends most sensitively on @xmath2 among the key cosmological parameters and thus it is in principle one of the most optimal probes of the power spectrum normalization .",
    "yet , it is worth noting that there is one weak point about using the void ellipticity function as a cosmological probe .",
    "the number of observable voids at different redshifts is relatively small compared with that of observable clusters , which means that it tends to suffer from small - number statistics .",
    "the future galaxy surveys may allow us to overcome this limitation .",
    "our future work is in the direction of forecasting constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath6 from the forthcoming galaxy surveys by exploiting the void ellipticity function ( c. cunha and j. lee in preparation ) .",
