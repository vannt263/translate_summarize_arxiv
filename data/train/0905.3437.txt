    "evidence has been mounting in recent years that turbulence plays an important role in the physics of the ism as well as in governing star formation .",
    "it is believed that turbulence is responsible for generating the hierarchy of structures present across a range of spatial scales in the ism ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . in such models",
    "the ism has a fractal structure and the power spectrum of intensity fluctuations is a power law , indicating that there is no preferred  cloud \" size .    on the observational front , power spectrum analysis of hi intensity fluctuations is an important technique to probe the structure of the neutral ism in galaxies .",
    "the power spectra of the hi intensity fluctuations in our own galaxy , the lmc and the smc all show power law behaviour ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) which is a characteristic of a turbulent medium .",
    "recently @xcite have presented a visibility based formalism for determining the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations in galaxies with extremely weak emission .",
    "this formalism was applied to a dwarf galaxy , ddo  210 and a spiral galaxy ngc  628 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the hi power spectrum of both of these galaxies were found to be power law . in this report",
    "we present a elaborate description of this method .",
    "we also report the result of estimation of the power spectrum of 3 spiral galaxies and 5 dwarf galaxies .",
    "the specific intensity of the hi emission from a galaxy may be modelled as @xmath2\\,.\\ ] ] here we have assumed that this is the sum of a smooth component and a fluctuating component .",
    "we express the fluctuating component of the specific intensity as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is assumed to be a statistically homogeneous and isotropic stochastic fluctuation and @xmath5 is the window function which quantify the overall large scale hi distribution of the galaxy . since , the angular extent of the galaxies that we consider here is much smaller than the primary beam , we can write the visibility , the quantity directly measured by the radio interferometers , as @xmath6 where the tilde @xmath7 denotes the fourier transform of the corresponding quantity and @xmath8 denotes a convolution .",
    "in addition to the signal , each visibility also contains a system noise contribution @xmath9 which we have introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vis2 ] ) .",
    "the noise in each visibility is a gaussian random variable and the noise in the visibilities at two different baselines @xmath10 and @xmath11 is uncorrelated . at larger baselines , where the effect of the window function can be neglected ,",
    "we can write , @xmath12 we use the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 to quantify the statistical properties of the intensity fluctuations .",
    "we use angular averaging in place of the ensemble averaging denoted by the angular brackets .",
    "the square of the visibilities can , in principle , be used to estimate @xmath13 @xmath15 the last term @xmath16 , which is the noise variance , introduces a positive bias in estimating the power spectrum .",
    "the noise bias can be orders of magnitude larger than the power spectrum for the faint external galaxies considered here .",
    "the problem of noise bias can be avoided by correlating visibilities at two different baselines for which the noise is expected to be uncorrelated .",
    "we define the power spectrum estimator @xmath17    in our analysis we consider two different models for the window function of a galaxy .",
    "we present them here in the fourier transformed form . @xmath18 and @xmath19 it is to note that the visibilities at two different baselines will be correlated only if @xmath20 , and not beyond . in our analysis",
    "we restrict the difference in baselines to @xmath21 so that @xmath22 and the estimator @xmath23 no longer depends on @xmath24 .",
    "we then use the visibility correlation estimator @xmath25 we use the real part of the estimator @xmath26 to estimate power spectrum @xmath13 .",
    "the real part is the power spectrum of hi intensity fluctuations convolved with the square of the window function . at large baselines ,",
    "the effect of the window function can be neglected and we then have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant .",
    "the estimator @xmath26 also has a small imaginary part that arises from the hi power spectrum because the assumption that @xmath29 is not strictly valid .",
    "we use the requirement that the imaginary part of @xmath30 should be small compared to the real part as a self - consistency check to determine the range of validity of our formalism .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the measured value of the estimator @xmath26 both have uncertainties arising from ( 1 . ) the sample variance and ( 2 . ) the system noise .",
    "we add both these contributions to determine the @xmath31 error - bars .",
    "the reader is referred to section 3.2 of @xcite for further details of the error estimation .",
    "the dwarf galaxy data used here is from giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) observations .",
    "we use very large array(vla ) archival data , for the spiral galaxies ngc  628 , ngc  2403 and ngc  1058 .",
    "details can be found in @xcite    all the data are reduced in the usual way using standard tasks in classic aips . for each galaxy , after calibration the frequency channels with hi emission were identified and a continuum image was made by combining the line free channels .",
    "the continuum was hence subtracted from the data in the @xmath0 plane using the aips task uvsub .",
    "we correlate the visibilities in each channel as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrn ] ) and then average over channels to get @xmath32 .",
    "we then fit a power law @xmath33 to the estimator @xmath34 .",
    "the best fit @xmath35 and @xmath36 were determined through a @xmath37 minimization . to test whether the impact of the window function is actually small",
    "we have convolved the best fit power spectrum with @xmath38 .",
    "we estimate the goodness of fit ( @xmath39 ) to the data for the convolved power spectrum . the fit is accepted only after ensuring that the effect of the convolution can actually be ignored .",
    "the results are listed in table  1 .",
    "the galaxies in our sample have dichotomy in the slope @xmath36 ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "we have proposed a possible explanation for this in @xcite .",
    "this was based on the fact that ddo  210 , where the power spectrum was measured across length - scales @xmath42 , had a slope of @xmath40 while ngc  628 , a nearly face - on galaxy where the power spectrum was measured across length - scales @xmath43 had a slope of @xmath44 .",
    "we have interpreted the former as three dimensional ( 3d ) turbulence operational at small scales whereas the latter was interpreted as two dimensional ( 2d ) turbulence in the plane of the galactic disk .",
    "for a nearly face - on disk galaxy we expect the transition from 2d to 3d turbulence to be seen at a length - scale corresponding to the scale height of the galaxy .",
    "continuing with this interpretation implies that we have also measured 3d turbulence in ngc  3741 , and 2d turbulence in ngc  2403 , ugc  4459 , gr  8 and and  iv .",
    ".the results for the 5 dwarf and 3 spiral galaxies in our sample . rows 1 - 3 gives ( 1 ) the best fit slope @xmath36 , ( 2 ) length - scales over which the power law fit is valid and ( 3 ) the goodness of fit @xmath37 per degree of freedom . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the slope @xmath45 gives a good fit to the power spectrum measured at the length - scales @xmath46 kpc for ngc  1058 , where for the length scales @xmath47 pc@xmath48 kpc the best fit slope is @xmath49 .",
    "this , following the argument of dimensionality , is a transition from 2d to 3d turbulence .",
    "since the length - scale @xmath50 kpc is definitely larger than the scale height of any spiral galaxy , we interpret the wave - length @xmath51 kpc at this transition as the scale - height of the hi disk of ngc  1058 .",
    "to our knowledge this is the first observational determination of the scale - height of a nearly face on spiral galaxy through its hi power spectrum .",
    "we have plan to use the same estimator to estimate the power spectrum of a large sample of spiral galaxy and to find the correlation of the slope of the power spectrum of those galaxies with the other measurable dynamical parameters like scale height , total hi mass etc . of the galaxies ."
