    "it is now well established that spiral galaxies have universal rotation curves ( urc ) that can be characterized by one single free parameter , the luminosity ( e.g. rubin et al .",
    "1980 ; persic & salucci , 1991 , persic , salucci & stel 1996 ( pss ) ) .",
    "for instance , low - luminosity spirals show ever - rising rotation curves ( rc ) out to the optical radius , , with @xmath7 the exponential disk length - scale ] while , in the same region , the rc of high - luminosity spirals are flat or even decreasing .    it has been demonstrated by persic & salucci ( 1988 , 1990 ) and broeils ( 1992 ) that , as the galaxy luminosity decreases , the light is progressively unable to trace the radial distribution of the gravitating matter ( see also salucci , 1997 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is , in general , interpreted as the signature of an invisible mass component ( rubin et.al .",
    "1980 ; bosma 1981 ) .",
    "as pointed out by pss the universality of the rotation curves , in combination with the invariant distribution of the luminous matter , implies an universal dark matter distribution with luminosity - dependent scaling properties .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "recent high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations have shown that cold dark matter halos achieve a specific equilibrium density profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , nfw ; cole & lacey 1997 ; fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ; kravtsov et al .",
    "1998 ) . this can be characterized by one free parameter , e.g. @xmath8 , the dark mass enclosed within the radius inside which the average over - density is 200 times the critical density of the universe . in the innermost regions",
    "the dark matter profiles show some scatter around an average profile which is characterized by a power - law cusp @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ( nfw , moore et al .",
    "1998 , bullock et al . , 1999 ) .    until recently ,",
    "due to both the limited number of suitable rotation curves and a poor knowledge of the exact amount of luminous matter present in the innermost regions of spirals , it has been difficult to investigate the internal structure of dark matter halos .",
    "the situation is more favorable for ( low surface brightness ) dwarf galaxies which are strongly dark matter dominated even at small radii .",
    "the kinematics of these systems shows an universality of the dark halo density profiles , but , it results in disagreement with that predicted by cdm , in particular because of the existence of dark halo density cores .",
    "( moore 1994 ; burkert 1995 ) .",
    "the origin of these features is not yet understood ( see e.g. navarro , eke & frenk 1996 ; burkert & silk 1997 , gelato & sommer - larsen 1999 ) , but it is likely that it involves more physics than a simple hierarchical assembly of cold structures . to cope with this observational evidence , burkert ( 1995 ) proposed an empirical profile that successfully fitted the halo rotation curves of four dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies @xmath11 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are free parameters which represent the central dark matter density and the scale radius .",
    "this sample has been extended , more recently , to 17 dwarf irregular and low surface brightness galaxies ( kravtsov et al .",
    "1998 , see however van den bosch et al .",
    "1999 ) which all are found to confirm equation ( 1 ) . adopting spherical symmetry ,",
    "the mass distribution of the burkert halos is given by @xmath12 \\big\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 , the dark mass within the core given by : @xmath14 the halo contribution to the circular velocity is then : @xmath15 although the dark matter core parameters @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 are in principle independent , the observations reveal a clear correlation ( burkert 1995 ) : @xmath16 which indicates that dark halos represent a 1-parameter family which is completely specified , e. g. by the core mass .    the analysis of a recently published large sample of rc s ( persic & salucci , 1995 ) has provided a suitable framework to investigate the dark halo density distribution in spirals .",
    "the starting points of this study are : _ a ) _ the mass in spirals is distributed according to the inner baryon dominance ( ibd ) regime : there is a characteristic transition radius @xmath17 for which , at @xmath18 , the luminous matter totally accounts for the mass distribution , while , for @xmath19 , the dm _ rapidly _ becomes the dominant dynamical component ( salucci and persic , 1999a , b ; salucci et al , 2000 ; ratnam and salucci , 2000 ; borriello and salucci , 2000 ) .",
    "then , although the dark halo might extend down to the galaxy center , it is only for @xmath20 that it gives a non - negligible contribution to the circular velocity . _",
    "b ) _ the dark matter is distributed in a different way with respect to any of the various baryonic components ( pss , corbelli and salucci , 2000 ) , and _",
    "c ) _ the hi contribution to the circular velocity , for @xmath21 , is negligible ( e.g. rhee , 1996 ; verheijen , 1997 ) .",
    "the main aim of this letter is to expand the above results to derive the luminosity - averaged density profiles of the dark halos and to relate them with the burkert profiles .",
    "section 2 presents the analysis of a homogeneous sample of about 1100 rotation curves in which the dark halo contribution to the circular velocity is first derived and then matched to the burkert halo mass models . in section 3",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "we take @xmath22 and @xmath23 , however no result depends on these choices .",
    "pss ( see also rubin et al .",
    "1982 ) have derived , from @xmath24 velocity measurements of 1000 rotation curves ( rc ) , @xmath25 , the synthetic rotation velocities of spirals sorted by luminosity ( figure 1 , with @xmath26 the i - band luminosity and @xmath27 .",
    "remarkably , _ individual _ rc s have a very small variance with respect to the corresponding synthetic curves ( pss , rhee 1996 , rhee & van albada 1996 , roscoe 1999 , swaters , 1999 ) : spirals sweep a very narrow locus in the rc - profile / amplitude / luminosity space .",
    "on the other hand , the galaxy kinematical properties do significantly change with luminosity ( e.g. pss ) , so it is natural to relate the mass distribution with this quantity .",
    "the whole set of synthetic rc s has been modeled with the universal rotation curve ( urc ) , @xmath28 which includes : _ ( a ) _ an exponential thin disk term : @xmath29 and _ ( b ) _ a spherical halo term : @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 the halo core radius in units of @xmath35 . at high luminosities",
    "the contribution from a bulge component has been also considered ( salucci and persic , 1999b ) .",
    "let us stress that the halo velocity term of eq .",
    "( 7 ) does not bias the mass model : it can account for maximum - disk , solid - body , no - halo , all - halo , cdm and core - less halo mass models . in practice , the values of the free parameters @xmath34 and @xmath36 that result from fitting the urc @xmath37 to the synthetic curves @xmath38 select the actual model . adopting @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( see pss ) or , equivalently the corresponding @xmath41 that we have plotted in fig . ( 2 ) , the urc mass models reproduce the synthetic curves @xmath42 within their r.m.s .",
    "( see fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) . more in detail , at any luminosity and radius , @xmath43 and the @xmath44 fitting uncertainties on @xmath34 and @xmath36 are about 20% ( pss ) .",
    "we then compare the dark halo velocities obtained with eq .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 9 ) , with the burkert velocities @xmath45 of eqs .",
    "( 2)-(4 ) .",
    "we leave @xmath0 and @xmath1 as free parameters , i. e. we do not impose the relationship of eq . ( 5 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig ( 3 ) : at any luminosity , out to the outermost radii ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath45 is indistinguishable from @xmath47 .",
    "more specifically , by setting @xmath48 , we are able to reproduce the synthetic rotation curves @xmath42 at the level of their r.m.s . for @xmath49 , i.e. beyond the region described by the urc , the two velocity profiles progressively differ .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath1 and @xmath0 for the urc agrees with the extrapolation at high masses of the scaling law @xmath50 ( burkert , 1995 ) established for objects with core radii @xmath1 ten times smaller ( see fig 4 ) .",
    "let us notice that the core radii are very large : @xmath51 so that an ever - rising halo rc can not be excluded by the data .",
    "moreover , the disk - mass vs. central halo density relationship @xmath52 , found in dwarf galaxies ( burkert,1995 ) , where the densest halos harbor the least massive disks , holds also for disk systems of stellar mass up to @xmath53 ( see fig 4 ) .",
    "the above relationship show a curvature at the highest masses / lowest densities that can be related to the existence of an upper limit in the dark halo mass @xmath8 with @xmath54 the formation redshift , @xmath55 the virial radius , for @xmath56 see e.g. bullock et al . , ( 1999 ) ; the critical density is defined as : @xmath57 . ] which is evident by the sudden decline of the baryonic _ mass _ function of disk galaxies at @xmath58 ( salucci and persic , 1999a ) , that implies a maximum halo mass of    @xmath59    where @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( e.g. burles and tytler , 1998 ) are the matter and baryonic densities of the universe in units of critical density . from the definition of @xmath8 , by means of eq .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we can write @xmath8 in terms of the `` observable '' quantity @xmath62 : @xmath63 . for @xmath64 , @xmath65 ;",
    "notice that there is a mild dependences of @xmath66 on @xmath54 and @xmath60 which is irrelevant for the present study . combining eq .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 10 ) we obtain an upper limit for the central density , @xmath67 , which implies a lack of objects with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as is evident in figure 3 . turning the argument around , the deficit of objects with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , suggests that , at this mass scale , the total - to- baryonic mass fraction may approache the cosmological value @xmath72 .",
    "out to two optical radii , the burkert density profile reproduces , for the whole spiral luminosity sequence , the dm halos mass distribution .",
    "this density profile , though at very large radii coincides with the nfw profile , approaches a constant , finite density value at the center , in a way consistent with an isothermal distribution .",
    "this is in contradiction to cosmological models ( e.g. fukushige and makino 1997 ) which predict that the velocity dispersion @xmath73 of the dark matter particles decreases towards the center to reach @xmath74 for @xmath75 . after the result of this study ,",
    "the dark halo inner regions , therefore , can not be considered as kinematically cold structures but rather as `` warm '' regions with size @xmath76 .",
    "the halo core sizes are very large : @xmath77 .",
    "then , the boundary of the core region is well beyond the region where the stars are located and , as in corbelli and salucci ( 2000 ) , even at the outermost observed radius there is not the slightest evidence that dark halos converge to a @xmath78 ( or a steeper ) regime .",
    "we find that the dark halos around spirals are essentially an one - parameter family .",
    "it is relevant that the order parameter ( the central density or the core radius ) correlates with the luminous mass ( see fig 4 ) .",
    "we do however not know how it is related to the global structural properties of the dark halo , like the virial radius or the virial mass .",
    "in fact , the rc out to @xmath79 is completely determined by the core parameters , i.e. the central core density and the core radius , both of which are not defined in the cdm scenario .    the location of spiral galaxies in the parameter space of virial mass , halo central density and baryonic mass is determined by different processes that occur on different scales and at different red - shifts . yet",
    ", this 3d space degenerates into a single curve ( see figure 4,remind that : @xmath80 and remind that : @xmath81 which describes the dark - luminous coupling .",
    "let us discuss the limitations of the present results .",
    "first , here we have considered the luminosity dependence of the dark halo structure .",
    "although this is probably the most relevant one , other dependences ( hubble type and surface brightness ) should also be investigated . moreover ,",
    "the existence of a ( weak ) cosmic variance in the halo structural properties can not be excluded until we analyze individual objects ( salucci , 2000 , borriello and salucci , 2000 ) .",
    "secondly , we have derived the profile of dm halos out to about six disk - scale lengths , i.e. out to a distance much smaller than the virial radius . to assess the _ global _ validity of the proposed mass model data at larger radii are obviously required ."
