    "several astrophysical observational data have shown that our universe is undergoing an era of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to explain this bizarre phenomenon , various models of cosmology have been put forward , ranging from the simplest one of a cosmological constant to the scalar field theory of dark energy and modified gravitational theory as well @xcite . on the other hand , taking dark energy for the presumed cosmological component is also used , combined with the einstein field equations , to deal with some local gravitational issues @xcite , such as the relevant features of black holes .",
    "recently , kiselev has brought forward new static spherically symmetric exact solutions of the einstein equations , either for a charged or uncharged black hole surrounded by quintessential matter or free from it , which satisfy the condition of the additivity and linearity @xcite . otherwise , using a linear post - newtonian approach , kerr et al .",
    "considered the orbital differential equations for test bodies of a binary system in the kerr - de sitter spacetime and gave the elliptically orbital solution @xcite . the solutions for parabolic and hyperbolic orbits",
    "can be obtained via the formulae of @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the trajectories of test masses in a binary system under the general metric mentioned in @xcite .",
    "four discrete theoretical values of the state parameter @xmath0 from @xmath1 to @xmath2 are used to solve the orbital equations , respectively .",
    "similar to the classic tests of einstein s general relativity @xcite , the formulae gotten here can be used to explore whether dark energy exists or not along with the improvement upon observational techniques in astronomy . by introducing the effective potential",
    ", we also discuss the classification of the motion .",
    "the metric for a black hole surrounded by quintessence is laid out in section ii .",
    "we calculate trajectories of test masses in detail in section iii . in section iv , we display the classification of the motion and a brief conclusion follows .",
    "we use the metric signature @xmath3 and make @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 equal to unity .",
    "to begin with , kiselev s work @xcite is reviewed briefly .",
    "the interval of a spherically symmetric static gravitational field is @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions of @xmath10 . due to the condition of the additivity and linearity , which implies @xmath11 , the energy - momentum tensor of quintessence",
    "can be written as @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density of the quintessential matter while @xmath0 is the state parameter . by setting @xmath15 , we get @xmath16 whose solutions are of the forms @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the normalization factors",
    ". then , according to the relation @xmath20 @xmath18 should be negative for quintessence because the density of energy is positive . as a resulting",
    ", the metric for the space surrounded by the quintessential matter can be expressed by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the black hole mass and @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , it can be reduced to the schwarzschild and schwarzschild - de sitter metrics by @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "in relativistic dynamics , the contravariant 4d momentum @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the rest mass . then the covariant momentum , which is more important in dynamics , can be introduced by @xmath29 . when particles move in the gravitational field , dynamical conserved quantities are determined by the space - time symmetry of the metric field . from the metric ( [ eq8 ] ) , we may see clearly that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are both cyclic coordinates ; therefore , conserved quantities of the test mass are the @xmath30 and @xmath31 components of @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath33 @xmath34    due to the symmetry , the test mass moves on the symmetric plane formed by the initial velocity vector ( 3d ) and center of force .",
    "we regard the direction vertical to the orbital plane as the polar axis .",
    "then the motion of the test mass satisfies @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 are conserved quantities written in the form @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constants of integration that represent energy and angular momentum per unit mass , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the normalization condition for the 4d velocity , @xmath42 , also provides the equation @xmath43 equations ( [ eq11 ] ) to ( [ eq14 ] ) are four first integrals of the geodesic equation , which compose a set of self - contained differential equations of particle dynamics .    after being cleared up",
    ", these equations can lead to the relativistic extension of the binet formula of newtonian mechanics , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , because the orbit is not a circle and the second term on the right - hand side is a relativistic correction , while the last two are quintessential contributions .",
    "we have introduced the dimensionless variable @xmath46 , and for convenience @xmath47 has been used in the process of the calculation .",
    "note that @xmath46 is a small quantity .",
    "when @xmath48 , @xmath49 also appears in the denominator .",
    "so we now evaluate the magnitude of the last two terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) .",
    "first , we make the transformation @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; then eq . ( [ eq15 ] ) turns to @xmath52 the transformation parameter @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 $ ] , while @xmath55 $ ] . as for @xmath56 , we know that the state parameter @xmath25 represents the standard @xmath57 model , and therefore @xmath58 . from recent cosmological observations , the magnitude of the cosmological constant is @xmath59 with @xmath60 . as a result ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath56 is @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , due to the definition @xmath46 , we have the expression @xmath62 by way of a practical evaluation , we take the orbital radius of mercury , @xmath63 , which is the smallest in the solar system and for the other parameters we get @xmath64 . as a result ,",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) yields @xmath65 furthermore , from the binet equation in newtonian mechanics , @xmath66 whose solution is @xmath67 we find that @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath69 the last two terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) are far less than @xmath49 and @xmath70 and can be regarded as small corrections .    according to the linear perturbation scheme put forward in @xcite ,",
    "the last three terms could be treated as perturbations being a function of @xmath31 by substituting for @xmath49 the unperturbed solution . due to the supernova",
    "s dimming , the dark energy should satisfy @xmath71 to fit the observations @xcite . but here , without essential loss of generality , we evaluate the quintessential matter from a theoretical point of view with the state parameter in the range of @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "so we discuss the influence of quintessence on the trajectory of the test mass in four cases .      when @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) reduces to @xmath73 where @xmath49 is a small quantity , resulting in a slight correction of @xmath74 .",
    "so we ignore it in the first place , and we find the zeroth - order approximate solution @xmath75 we presume that the bound orbit is an ellipse with eccentricity @xmath76 . via substituting @xmath77 into the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) , we can get the first - order approximate solution @xmath78 , \\label{eq23}\\ ] ] where small higher - order quantities , which are impossible to measure very accurately , are neglected for their insignificant effects .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ eq22 ] ) means that @xmath79 , and in the weak - field regime , @xmath80 . introducing @xmath81",
    "$ ] , namely @xmath82 , makes @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "( [ eq15 ] ) reduces to @xmath89 similar to the case of @xmath72 , the zeroth - order approximate solution is @xmath90;\\ ] ] then the first - order approximate solution reads @xmath91 .",
    "\\label{eq28}\\ ] ] introducing @xmath92 makes eq .",
    "( [ eq28 ] ) reduce to @xmath93\\right\\}.\\ ] ] furthermore , the difference of the azimuth angle is @xmath94 here , @xmath87 is ignored , and quintessence also affects the first term , because the zeroth - order approximate solution is changed for the component @xmath31 .      when @xmath95 , eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) reduces to @xmath96 obviously , the form turns out to be complicated , because @xmath74 appears in the denominator .",
    "but as mentioned before , @xmath97 , so the last two terms are both perturbation ones .",
    "here we could deal with it by the linear perturbation scheme in @xcite , where the motion of test bodies in the kerr - de sitter spacetime was studied . substituting the zeroth - order approximate solution @xmath98 with @xmath99 for @xmath49 into the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq31 ] ) , we can divide the resulting linear equation into two parts : @xmath100 @xmath101 after being transformed , eq .",
    "( [ eq33 ] ) can be integrated once to the form @xmath102 = -\\frac{q}{e\\left(1-\\xi^2\\right)^{3/2}\\left(1+e\\xi\\right ) } + \\frac{c}{\\left(1-\\xi^2\\right)^{3/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a constant of integration .",
    "if once more we integrate it , using formulae ( 2.264 ) , ( 2.266 ) and ( 2.269 ) given in @xcite , then we get @xmath107 + c\\cos\\varphi+s\\sin\\varphi,\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is a constant of integration and @xmath109 combining with a particular solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq32 ] ) , the final solution for this case is @xmath110 , which can be rewritten in the form @xmath111+\\left(\\frac{m}{l^2}+\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right ) \\left\\{1+e\\cos\\left[\\left(1-\\varepsilon\\right)\\varphi\\right]\\right\\},\\ ] ] with @xmath112 introduced . here",
    "@xmath49 may reduce to the result of schwarzschild case @xcite as @xmath113 .      when @xmath25 , eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) reduces to @xmath114 the unperturbed solution is @xmath98 with @xmath115 .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath95 , according to the result ( 49 ) in @xcite the approximate solution is @xmath116 + \\frac{m}{l^2}\\left\\{1+e\\cos\\left[\\left(1-\\varepsilon\\right)\\varphi\\right]\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 is represented by eq .",
    "( [ eq36 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath113 , this result reduces to the schwarzschild solution .",
    "it is different from the two former cases in that the difference of the azimuth angle of the pericenter hardly comes out when @xmath95 or @xmath2 due to the complicated form .",
    "for timelike geodesics for variable @xmath41 with @xmath24 and @xmath120 . solid line for @xmath121 , dash line for @xmath122 , dash - dot line for @xmath123.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    here , we turn to a discussion of the classification of the motion .",
    "first , we introduce the relativistic effective potential @xmath124 thus , the radial equation derived from ( [ eq14 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath125 , which implies that the possible motions only occur when @xmath126 .",
    "expand eq .",
    "( [ eq40 ] ) , @xmath127 because the effect of @xmath18 on @xmath128 is very small , the curves of @xmath128 are almost the same as that in the schwarzschild space @xcite .",
    "so we illustrate the effective potential @xmath128 for variable @xmath41 with @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we see that for @xmath121 , there is a potential barrier whose peak value is larger than 1 when @xmath10 is very small , while there is also a potential well when @xmath10 is large .",
    "thus , the possible motions can be classified as three kinds @xmath129 with decreasing @xmath41 , the central potential barrier decreases in altitude . in the range of @xmath130 , @xmath131 , which indicates that the appearance of the scattering state is impossible , with the bound and absorbing states being left over .",
    "if @xmath132 , both the peak and the hollow of the effective potential will disappear , and only the absorbing state is left over . but note that the above analysis is based on one assumption that the radius of the gravitation source is so small that the exterior of the source is applicable for very small @xmath10 .    in summary , we have studied the trajectories of test bodies on the motion of a binary system in the presence of quintessence .",
    "there are four cases of the state parameter @xmath0 of quintessence , and we obtain four corresponding orbital equations , where it is assumed that the test mass moves round the center of force with eccentricity @xmath76",
    ". the difference of the azimuth angle of the pericenter can be cast in formulae in the two former cases , while the other two complicated ones can hardly be done , considering their different forms .",
    "moreover , the effect caused by dark energy is too small to be detectable in the solar system .",
    "but the common feature of our four cases is that the resultant solutions reduce to the outcomes in schwarzschild space naturally as the parameter @xmath18 vanishes .",
