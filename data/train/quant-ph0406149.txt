    "some time ago bessis and bessis ( bb from now on ) @xcite proposed a new perturbation approach in quantum mechanics based on the application of a factorization method to a riccati equation derived from the schrdinger one .",
    "they obtained reasonable results for some of the energies of the quartic anharmonic oscillator by means of perturbation series of order fourth and sixth , without resorting to a resummation method . in spite of this success ,",
    "bb s method has passed unnoticed as far as we know .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate bb s perturbation method in more detail . in section [ sec : method ] we write it in a quite general way and derive other approaches as particular cases . in section [ sec : results ] we carry out perturbation calculations of sufficiently large order and try to find out numerical evidence of convergence .",
    "one  dimensional anharmonic oscillators prove to be a suitable benchmark for present numerical tests . for simplicity",
    "we restrict to ground states and choose straightforward logarithmic perturbation theory instead of the factorization method proposed by bb @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the results and draw some conclusions .",
    "in standard rayleigh  schrdinger perturbation theory we try to solve the eigenvalue equation @xmath0 by expanding the energy @xmath1 and eigenfunction @xmath2 in a taylor series about @xmath3 .",
    "this method is practical provided that we can solve the eigenvalue equation for @xmath3 .    in some cases",
    "it is more convenient to construct a parameter ",
    "dependent hamiltonian operator @xmath4 that one can expand in a taylor series about @xmath5 @xmath6 in such a way that we can solve the eigenvalue equation for @xmath7 . in this case",
    "we expand the eigenfunctions @xmath8 and eigenvalues @xmath9 in taylor series : @xmath10 there are many practical examples of application of this alternative approach @xcite .",
    "in particular , bb @xcite suggested the following form of @xmath4 : @xmath11 comparing equations ( [ eq : h(beta)_series ] ) and ( [ eq : h(beta)_bessis ] ) we conclude that @xmath12 in principle there is enormous flexibility in the choice of the operator coefficients @xmath13 as we show below by derivation of two known particular cases .    if we restrict the expansion ( [ eq : h(beta)_bessis ] ) to just one term @xmath14 then @xmath15 .",
    "choosing @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a parameter ",
    "dependent hamiltonian operator with known eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , we obtain the method proposed by killingbeck @xcite some time ago . the main strategy behind this approach",
    "is to choose an appropriate value of the adjustable parameter @xmath18 leading to a renormalized perturbation series with the best convergence properties @xcite .",
    "if we consider two terms of the form @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then we derive the hamiltonian operator @xmath21+\\beta ^{2}\\lambda \\hat{h}^{\\prime } $ ] that killingbeck et al @xcite have recently found to be even more convenient for the treatment of some perturbation problems .",
    "those approaches are practical if we can solve the eigenvalue equation for @xmath5 and all relevant values of @xmath18 .",
    "we should mention that it was not the aim of bb to obtain renormalized series with an adjustable parameter but to choose the operator coefficients @xmath22 in such a way that they could solve the perturbation equations @xmath23 in exact algebraic form @xcite .",
    "for simplicity in this paper we concentrate on a one  dimensional eigenvalue equation of the form @xmath24\\psi ( x),\\;u(x)=v(x)+\\frac{l(l+1)}{x^{2}% } .",
    "\\label{eq : schro_x}\\ ] ] if @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the angular  momentum quantum number , this equation applies to central  field models .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we have a one  dimensional model .",
    "in particular , when @xmath29 then @xmath28 , and @xmath30 , select the spaces of even and odd solutions , respectively . in any case the regular solution to the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : schro_x ] ) behaves asymptotically as @xmath31 at origin .",
    "in order to calculate perturbation corrections of sufficiently large order by means of bb s method we define @xmath32 that satisfies the riccati equation @xmath33 the corresponding equation for the hamiltonian @xmath4 in equation ( [ eq : h(beta)_bessis ] ) reads @xmath34 if we restrict to the case that @xmath35 depends only on @xmath36 and the coordinate .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion @xmath37 satisfy the perturbation equations @xmath38",
    "simple one  dimensional anharmonic oscillators @xmath39 , @xmath40 , are a suitable demanding benchmark for testing new perturbation approaches .",
    "we easily increase the degree of difficulty by increasing the values of the coupling parameter @xmath41 and anharmonicity exponent @xmath42 .",
    "bb applied their method to the first four energy levels of the model with @xmath43 and several values of @xmath41 , restricting their calculation to perturbation theory of order four and six . here",
    "we consider the strong  coupling limit ( @xmath44 ) of the oscillators mentioned above : @xmath45 notice that if the perturbation series gives acceptable results for this case , then it will certainly be suitable for all @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the perturbation corrections for these models are simpler enabling us to proceed to higher orders with less computational requirement .    in order to make present discussion clearer",
    "we first illustrate the main ideas of the method with the pure quartic oscillator @xmath43 .",
    "we try polynomial solutions of the form @xmath47 in the perturbation equations ( [ eq : pt_f_j ] ) for the ground state ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "substitution of @xmath49 into the perturbation equation of order zero leads to @xmath50 in order to have a solution with @xmath51 we choose @xmath52 ; then @xmath53 , and @xmath54 becomes a cubic equation with two complex and one real root .",
    "if we select the later we finally have @xmath55 we expect the resulting unperturbed wavefunction @xmath56 to be an improvement on the harmonic ",
    "oscillator one in standard rayleigh ",
    "schrdinger perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the zeroth ",
    "order energy ( [ eq : f0,e0 ] ) is reasonably close to the exact value shown in table  [ tab:1 ] which was obtained with the riccati ",
    "pad method @xcite .    at first order",
    "we have @xmath57 we easily solve this equation if @xmath58 ; the result is @xmath59 the energy corrected through first order is somewhat closer to the exact value : @xmath60 .",
    "the systematic calculation of perturbation corrections of larger order offers no difficulty if we resort to a computer algebra system like maple @xcite .",
    "since we are unable to prove rigorously whether the perturbation series converges , we resort to numerical investigation .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows that @xmath61 first decreases rapidly as @xmath62 increases , but then it increases slowly suggesting that the series does not converge .",
    "if we assume that the error on the energy estimated by the partial sum @xmath63}=\\sum_{j=0}^{m}e_{j }   \\label{eq : e[m]}\\ ] ] is proportional to the first neglected term @xmath64}|\\approx |e_{m+1}|$ ] , then it is reasonable to truncate the perturbation series so that @xmath65 is as small as possible @xcite . in this case",
    "we find that @xmath66 is the energy coefficient with the smallest absolute value so that our best estimate is @xmath67}=1.06036215 $ ] ( compare with the exact value in table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "we proceed exactly in the same way for the pure sextic oscillator @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows values of @xmath61 that clearly suggest poorer convergence properties than in the preceding example .",
    "the energy coefficient with the smallest absolute value is @xmath69 , and our best estimate @xmath70}=1.14470 $ ] is reasonably close to the exact eigenvalue in table  [ tab:1 ] . in principle",
    ", it is not surprising that perturbation theory yields poorer results for @xmath68 than for @xmath43 @xcite .    for the pure octic anharmonic oscillator @xmath71",
    "we look for polynomial solutions of the form @xmath72 in this case we have calculated less perturbation coefficients because they require more computer memory and time .",
    "surprisingly , the values of latexmath:[$\\log    for @xmath71 exhibits better convergence properties than the one for @xmath68 just discussed .",
    "the energy coefficient with the smallest absolute value ( among those we managed to calculate ) is : @xmath74 so that our best estimate is @xmath75}=$ ] @xmath76 which is quite close to the exact one in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the surprising fact that the convergence properties of the perturbation series are clearly poorer for @xmath68 than for @xmath71 suggests that there should be better solutions for the former case .",
    "if we try @xmath77 then the values of @xmath61 are smaller than those obtained earlier ( compare @xmath78 with @xmath68 in figure  [ fig:1 ] ) . the coefficient with the smallest absolute value is @xmath79 and our best estimate results to be @xmath70}=1.1448015 $ ] .    it is well known that pad approximants give considerably better results than power series @xcite .",
    "we have tried diagonal pad approximants @xmath80 $ ] on the perturbation series for the cases @xmath43 , @xmath78 , and @xmath71 and show results in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "notice that the pad approximants sum the @xmath81 series to a great accuracy but they are less efficient for @xmath78 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is exactly what is known to happen with the standard perturbation series for anharmonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "however , pad approximants appear to improve the accuracy of present perturbation results in all the cases discussed above .",
    "present numerical investigation on the perturbation method proposed by bessis and bessis @xcite suggests that although the series may be divergent they are much more accurate than those derived from standard rayleigh ",
    "schrdinger perturbation theory .",
    "one obtains reasonable eigenvalues for difficult anharmonic problems of the form @xmath82 , and results deteriorate much less dramatically than those from the standard rayleigh ",
    "schrdinger perturbation series as the anharmonicity exponent @xmath83 increases . in order to facilitate the calculation of perturbation corrections of sufficiently large order we restricted our analysis to polynomial solutions that are suitable for the ground state .",
    "the treatment of rational solutions for excited states ( like those considered by bb @xcite ) is straightfordward but increasingly more demanding .",
    "following bb @xcite we have implemented perturbation theory by transformation of the linear schrdinger equation into a nonlinear riccati one . in this way the appropriate form of each potential coefficient @xmath84 reveals itself more clearly as shown in section [ sec : results ] for the quartic model .",
    "however , in principle one can resort to any convenient algorithm because the perturbation method is sufficiently general as shown in section 2 .",
    "a remarkable advantage of the method of bb @xcite , which may not be so clear in their paper , is its extraordinary flexibility as shown by the two solutions obtained above for the case @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , the method of bb , unlike two other renormalization approaches derived above as particular cases @xcite , does not require and adjustable parameter to give acceptable results ."
