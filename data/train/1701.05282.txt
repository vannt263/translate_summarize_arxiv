    "the set @xmath6 is called the _ basin of @xmath5_. these notions were introduced by sinai in @xcite , where it was proved the existence of physical measures for anosov diffeomorphisms .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite and @xcite , bowen and ruelle showed that for hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and flows , there exist a finite number of physical measures whose basins are all essentially open ( i.e. , open module a set of null lebesgue measure ) , and the union of these basins cover a full lebesgue measure subset of the ambient manifold .",
    "for non - hyperbolic diffeomorphisms , in @xcite palis conjectured that every system can be approximated by systems with a finite number of physical measures whose basins unite to cover a full lebesgue measure subset of the whole manifold . in this term , as a positive step , in @xcite and @xcite , alves , bonatti and viana proved the existence and finiteness of physical measures for a large class of non - hyperbolic diffeomorphisms , namely partially hyperbolic systems with mostly contracting or mostly expanding center .    for hyperbolic systems ,",
    "basins of physical measures are essentially open .",

    "intermingled_. here we say two physical measures @xmath5 and @xmath8 have _ intermingled basins _ or their basins are _ intermingled _ if for any open set @xmath9 in the manifold , we have @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    kan s examples robustly admit two physical measures with intermingled basins within boundary preserving systems .",
    "his construction was extended by ilyashenko , kleptsyn and saltykov@xcite .",
    "kan also constructed partially hyperbolic examples on the thickened torus with two physical measures whose basins are intermingled .",
    "then in @xcite , kleptsyn and saltykov proved that the boundaries of basins of physical measures in kan s examples have hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than the dimension of the phase space .",
    "one would ask whether there exist more than two physical measures with their basins intermingled . in @xcite , dolgopyat , viana and",
    "yang constructed examples on @xmath12 admitting arbitrarily finitely many physical measures with intermingled basins . and",
    "recently , bonatti and potrie ( @xcite ) give examples on @xmath0 with arbitrarily finitely many physical measures whose basins are intermingled .",
    "their examples are partially hyperbolic but not strongly partially hyperbolic , that is , the center stable bundle @xmath13 can not be split to two invariant subbundles , which is different from the previous examples .",
    "it is well known that kan s examples can be extended to boundaryless manifolds such as @xmath0 , following the same arguments . in this case , however , ures and vasquez proved recently in @xcite that kan s examples can not be robust .",
    "in fact , they proved for @xmath14-partially hyperbolic , dynamically coherent diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 with compact center leaves , if two physical measures are intermingled , then they must both support in periodic tori which are @xmath15-saturated .",
    "thus these systems can not be accessible , and the number of physical measures with intermingled basins can not be larger than two . recall that in @xcite , burns , herts , herts , talitskaya and ures proved that accessibility property is @xmath16 open and @xmath17 dense among partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms with one - dimensional center .",
    "this implies that partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on @xmath0 with intermingled basins can not form a @xmath18 open set .",
    "it s also a natural question to ask whether kan s examples can be transitive or robustly transitive . in chapter 11 of @xcite , it is showed that with two more assumptions , kan s examples on 2-dimensional cylinder can be transitive . and",
    "recently , in @xcite , okunev proved that for the set of @xmath18 partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms which are skew products over transitive anosov diffeomorphisms and fibered by @xmath19 , there exists a residual subset @xmath20 , such that for every @xmath21 either it is transitive or its non - wandering set has zero lebesgue measure .    in this paper , we append some extra constructions to kan s examples on @xmath0 , which lead them to be robustly transitive .",

    "notice that @xmath587 and @xmath588 are both @xmath65-invariant , we conclude that @xmath582 itself intersects with @xmath587 and @xmath588 both in a set of positive lebesgue measure .",
    "now the conclusion follows by using fubini s theorem .      in this subsection , we will prove that for the examples constructed in the previous section , if they admit a unique physical measure under perturbations , then the perturbed ones must be topologically mixing . combined with proposition [ prop : two physical measures ] , the proof of theorem  [ theo : main theorem ] will be finished .",
    "recall that in the previous subsection , the perturbed systems remain to have two invariant tori .",
    "while in this subsection , we will show that if the perturbed systems admit a unique physical measure , then at least one of its invariant tori is broken .",
    "the following proposition provides us a characterization of the broken torus , which will be used later .",

    "then for any @xmath476 ,          denote @xmath597 for any @xmath598 , we claim that @xmath599 argue by contradiction , we suppose that there exists a point @xmath600 , such that @xmath601 contains at least two points , namely @xmath602 and @xmath603 . by definition ,",
    "there exist two sequence of points @xmath604 and @xmath605 such that @xmath606 tends to @xmath607 , @xmath183 .",

    "we now choose @xmath609 large enough such that @xmath610 is much smaller that @xmath608 , @xmath183 .",
    "then the distance of @xmath611 and @xmath612 in @xmath53 is much smaller than @xmath608 , and we can thus assume that there exists a point @xmath613 . then using leaf conjugacy property , we see @xmath614 due to the absolute continuity of the strong stable and strong unstable holonomy of @xmath65 , there exist two points",
    "@xmath615 satisfying      this implies that @xmath619 , which contradicts with our assumption .",
    "this contradiction implies our claim is true , i.e. , @xmath620 for every @xmath598 .",
    "this means @xmath200 is actually a topological torus transverse to the center foliation , and we denote it by @xmath593 from now on .",
    "bearing in mind @xmath593 contains a dense subset of @xmath621(resp .",
    "@xmath622 ) , we get @xmath623(resp .",
    "@xmath624 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath593 is @xmath82-minimal(resp .",
    "@xmath93-minimal ) and @xmath82-saturated(resp .",
    "@xmath93-saturated ) .",
    "@xmath593 is close to @xmath589 with respect to hausdorff metric , because @xmath625 varies lower semi - continuously as @xmath65 changes .",
    "[ prop : unique physical measure ] let @xmath63 and @xmath62 be defined as in proposition  [ prop : robust transitivity ] .",
    "then by shrinking @xmath62 if necessary , for any @xmath64 , if @xmath65 has a unique physical measure , then @xmath65 is robustly topologically mixing .    by shrinking @xmath62 if necessary ,",
    "suppose that the continuations of @xmath626 and @xmath627 are all well defined .",
    "we first claim that at least one of the two invariant tori of @xmath63 is broken under @xmath65 .",
    "otherwise , the two invariant tori @xmath628 and @xmath629 both have a continuation , denoted by @xmath630 and @xmath631 respectively .",
    "since @xmath632 are both @xmath82-saturated and disjoint to each other , each of them support a gibbs @xmath82-state , which is also a physical measure .",
    "this contradicts with the assumption that @xmath65 admits a unique physical measure .",
    "now that @xmath589 is broken , for @xmath636 and @xmath637 , there exists a point @xmath638 such that @xmath639 .",

    ". then @xmath65 is robustly mixing , according to proposition  [ prop : unique physical measure ] .",
    "however , the existence of an @xmath262-torus implies that neither the strong stable foliation nor the strong unstable foliation of @xmath65 is minimal .    for the case where we require the diffeomorphism to preserve the orientation of the center foliation(see remark  [ remark ] ) , it is a little bit tricky .",
    "we just sketch the main ingredients of the proof . according to equation  [ equation : hat f ] , for any @xmath75",
    ", @xmath429 is a smooth function on @xmath0 preserving the orientation of the center foliation .",
