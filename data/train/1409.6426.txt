    "the study of nuclear properties at high temperature , spin and isospin has gained much of interest in recent times .",
    "thanks to the recent developments in experimental facilities , these highly - excited nuclei are becoming more accessible and provide theorists with a challenging task . apart from these extremes",
    ", there are still some unexplored regimes of hot nuclei .",
    "the properties of nuclei at very low temperatures and the phase transitions associated with that belong to such area where conclusive experimental results are scarce . at such low temperatures , the shell ( quantal ) and pairing effects are quite active though being modified by thermal effects . among the famous and open questions in this regime",
    "are the existence of pairing phase transition , the order of it if it exists , the role of fluctuations , etc . in hot nuclei ,",
    "thermal fluctuations are expected to be large since the nucleus is a tiny finite system .",
    "thermal shape fluctuations and fluctuations in the pairing field are the dominating fluctuations and they have been so far studied separately within different models @xcite . both of these fluctuations are expected to be present at low temperatures .",
    "however , the interplay between them has not been investigated so far .",
    "the present work addresses this subject and we study the influence of this interplay on the experimental observables , namely the width of giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",
    "gdr is a fundamental mode of excitation of nuclei caused by the out of phase oscillations between the proton and neutron fluids under the influence of the electromagnetic field induced by the emitted / absorbed photon . in general , the resonance parameters of any resonating object are related to the geometry of the object . in this way , the gdr width and its cross - section could yield direct information about the shape of the nucleus .",
    "this is only a macroscopic description of gdr and there are microscopic approaches , which couple the gdr to particle - hole , particle - particle and hole - hole excitations @xcite . for hot nuclei , which are not accessible by the discrete @xmath3-ray spectroscopy and other conventional techniques , the measurement of gdr is considered to be a major probe to obtain the details of nuclear structure .",
    "the importance of measuring the gdr width at low temperatures was insisted by one among the authors @xcite and the first results were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found that the gdr width in @xmath1sn at @xmath4 1 mev is nearly the same as that in the ground state .",
    "this data point was successfully explained only after treating properly the pairing correlations with the phonon damping model ( pdm ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gdr width in @xmath5au extracted at @xmath4 0.7 mev is almost the same as its ground state value .",
    "however , it was misattributed to the shell effects as in the case of @xmath2pb .",
    "this was clarified later @xcite where the proper inclusion of shell effect was found to act in the opposite direction to raise the width and the pairing fluctuations were speculated to explain this anomaly .",
    "preliminary results in this regard were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite where the importance of considering pairing in the thermal shape fluctuation model has been emphasized .",
    "the recent low temperature gdr measurements done at variable energy cyclotron centre , kolkata @xcite highlight the interesting features of the gdr width in heavy nuclei observed at low temperatures .",
    "the thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm ) @xcite , which is often used by experimentalists , describes the increase of the gdr width with temperature by averaging the gdr cross section over all the quadrupole shapes .",
    "however this model is known to largely overestimate the gdr width in open - shell nuclei at low temperatures .",
    "the success of a proper treatment of pairing within the pdm @xcite suggests the necessity of including pairing correlations to cure this shortcoming of the tsfm .",
    "the pdm is a microscopic model , whose mechanism is different from that of the tsfm .",
    "the pairing has never been taken into account within the tsfm so far because of the ( incorrect ) assumption that the pairing gap disappears at @xmath6 1 mev .",
    "given the popularity of the tsfm the inclusion of pairing in the tsfm is quite important .",
    "this is done for the first time in the present work .",
    "apart from the tsfm , two phenomenological parameterizations have been reported @xcite which are very successful in approximating global behaviour of the gdr widths . in recent literature @xcite",
    "these parameterizations referred to as , phenomenological tsfm ( ptsfm ) @xcite and its modification to take into account the quenching of width at low @xmath7 has been referred to as a critical temperature included fluctuation model ( ctfm ) @xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that these empirical formulae constructed to mimic the results of tsfm should not be confused with the tsfm itself .",
    "the ptsfm and ctfm are merely a phenomenological parameterizations based on empirical data , which has neither microscopic nor macroscopic foundation .",
    "it is interesting to note , although both the pdm and ctfm give results consistent with the measurements of the gdr width in @xmath0tc @xcite , these two models are quite different from the tsfm .",
    "it is indeed mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that it would be interesting to compare the data with tsfm by including the effect of thermal pairing .    here",
    "we employ the thermal fluctuation model built on nilsson - strutinsky calculations with a macroscopic approach to gdr and examine the inclusion of the fluctuations in the pairing field . in refs .",
    "@xcite the same hamiltonian was used to generate the free energy as well as the gdr observables in a consistent way , which led to a slow thermal damping of gdr width when compared to the experimental results . the formalism adopted in the present work",
    "is well tested to reproduced several gdr observations at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "this formalism is extended to include thermal pairing and our results are discussed in the forthcoming sections .",
    "the present theoretical approach is explained below in threefold within the models for a ) deformation energy calculations , b ) relating the shapes to gdr observables and c ) considering the fluctuations due to thermal effects in finite systems .",

    "the total free energy ( @xmath8 ) at a fixed deformation is calculated using the expression @xmath9the liquid - drop energy ( @xmath10 ) is calculated by summing up the coulomb and surface energies corresponding to a triaxially deformed shape defined by the deformation parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the shell correction ( @xmath13 )",

    "the modification in free energy surface can be of two types viz .",
    "change in the minimum with @xmath77 proportional to the quadrupole deformation ( @xmath81 ) corresponding to the minimum .",
