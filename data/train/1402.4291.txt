    "recent observational data from the supernova cosmology project @xcite and the wmap data @xcite have strongly confirmed that we live in an accelerating universe . according to these observations , nearly 70@xmath1 of the total energy density of the universe has a large negative pressure which is apparently unclustered and is dubbed as dark energy ( de ) , which will in fact cause the cosmic expansion to speed up .",
    "a number of candidates have appeared in the literature which can generate the cosmic acceleration very effectively . for an excellent review on dark energy models",
    ", one can look into @xcite and @xcite .",
    "out of all these candidates , one of the most popular candidates is a scalar field with a positive potential which can generate an effective negative pressure if the potential term dominates over the kinetic term .",
    "this scalar field is often dubbed as _",
    " quintessence scalar field\"_. + however , quintessence scalar field models find difficulties in explaining why the energy densities of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) and quintessence matter ( q - matter ) should be comparable today .",
    "this is known as the coincidence problem .",
    "a  tracker field \" model can address this problem to some extent .",
    "this kind of fields has an attractor like solution with nearly independent initial conditions .",
    "however , it is not clear to what extent this field has ability to drive the current accelerated expansion of the universe as well as at the same time to give a solution to the coincidence problem . + another way to solve the coincidence problem is to consider that the two components of matter , namely , the cdm and dark energy or the q - matter are interacting so that during this interaction there will be some transfer of energy from one field to another .",
    "a number of models have been proposed where the flow of energy is from the dark matter component to the dark energy component @xcite , so that during the late time of evolution , the dark energy dominates over the ordinary matter and drives the acceleration . however , in most of these models , the interaction chosen is ad - hoc and such choices are not motivated by any physical theory .",
    "so , search is on for a suitable cosmologically viable interacting model of dark energy .",
    "+ in this paper , we have proposed a cosmological model for describing the dynamics of such an accelerating universe in brans - dicke theory where the dark matter and dark energy components are shown to interact among themselves",
    ". however , the form of interaction is not chosen arbitrarily ; rather it appears as a result of a particular kind of conformal transformation .",
    "these type of transformation was first proposed by dicke @xcite and has been extensively used since then in scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the reason for choosing brans - dicke scalar field is that unlike minimally coupled scalar field models , this geometrical scalar field has a proper theoretical background and no one has to bother about the genesis of the scalar field .",
    "however , in original brans - dicke theory , the scalar field is massless ; but in our model we have introduced a potential term for the scalar field .",
    "this type of scalar field have been investigated thoroughly as the driving agent for the late time acceleration of the universe @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we have considered a non - minimally coupled brans - dicke ( bd ) scalar field , along with a self - interacting potential @xmath2 . in",
    "the conformally transformed einstein@xmath3s frame , we try to solve einstein@xmath3s field equations and obtain different dynamical quantities in terms of the scale factor @xmath4 . in the following subsections ,",
    "first we assume a specific form of the energy density and then a specific form of the scale factor and obtain the various related parameters for both the models . in both cases",
    ", it has been shown that the deceleration parameter @xmath5 has a smooth transition from a positive value to some negative value which indicates that the universe was undergoing an early deceleration followed by late time acceleration which is essential for the structure formation of the universe .",
    "the important point to note here is that for both the choices , we have obtained the smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration for large values of @xmath0 , the brans - dicke parameter , which is consistent with the value suggested by solar system experiments @xcite .",
    "section 3 describes the observational constraints on various parameters of the model and the last section discusses the results .",
    "in brans - dicke theory , the action is given by @xmath6\\ ] ] ( we have chosen @xmath7 ) + where @xmath8 is the brans - dicke ( bd ) scalar field , @xmath9 is the ricci scalar , @xmath0 is the bd parameter , @xmath10 ) is the potential for the bd scalar field and @xmath11 is the matter lagrangian . in this theory @xmath12",
    "plays the role of the gravitational constant .",
    "+ from action ( [ action ] ) , we obtain the einstein field equations as @xmath13 + \\frac{1}{\\psi}\\left[\\psi_{,\\mu;\\nu } - g_{\\mu\\nu \\square\\psi}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ + \\frac{v(\\psi)}{\\psi}g_{\\mu\\nu } + \\frac{t_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath14 the matter content of the universe is considered to be that of a perfect fluid distribution given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the energy density and pressure of the fluid and @xmath18 is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "+ with the assumption that the universe is homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat , the universe is described by the frw line - element @xmath19\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the scale factor of the universe and @xmath21 is the cosmic time .",
    "+ the einstein field equations for the space - time given by equation ( [ metric ] ) for a spatially flat matter dominated universe ( @xmath22 ) are @xmath23 @xmath24 also , the wave equation for bd scalar field takes the form @xmath25\\ ] ] from these equations , one can easily arrive at the matter conservation equation as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hubble parameter and @xmath28 represents the matter density .",
    "+ next following @xcite we effect a conformal transformation of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 = @xmath31 and ln @xmath8 = @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "now , the relevant field equations ( [ eq1])-([eq2 ] ) in the new frame look like ( an overbar indicates quantities in the new frame and from now onwards a dot will indicate differentiation with respect to new time @xmath35 ) + @xmath36 @xmath37 also , the energy conservation equations in the new frame take the form + @xmath38 @xmath39 where w = @xmath40 .",
    "+   + it is clearly seen that the matter and the scalar field do not evolve independently in the new frame but interact with each other through a source term , denoted by q in the energy conservation equations ( [ mattercons ] ) and ( [ phicons ] ) . a positive q represents transfer of energy from matter field to scalar field ; a negative q represents transfer of energy from scalar field to matter field .",
    "a large amount of work has been done in this context where the energy transfer is from the dark matter to the dark energy component so that the later can grow at late times and drive the cosmic acceleration @xcite . in our model also , we have restricted ourselves to positive values of @xmath41 so as to ensure late time acceleration of the universe .    now , if we focus on the other interacting cosmological models , the basic need of such models is to assume a suitable form of coupling between dark matter and the scalar field . in majority of such models ,",
    "the form of interaction chosen is ad - hoc and the source of such interaction is not known .",
    "but , in our model , unlike other approaches , the coupling term is not an input but derived its structure from the einstein s field equations by introducing conformal transformation as already mentioned earlier . in the following sections we try to obtain some accelerating solutions for such an interacting model of the universe in the conformally transformed frame for two cases : ( 1 ) by considering a specific form for the energy density of the scalar field and ( 2 ) by considering a specific form of the scale factor @xmath42 .",
    "+      from equation ( [ phicons ] ) , one can easily obtain the energy density for the matter field as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the present value of the matter energy density and @xmath46 is the constant of integration . + from equations ( [ feq1 ] ) and ( [ feq2 ] ) ,",
    "one can write @xmath47 using the relationships @xmath48 and @xmath49 , equation ( [ hdoteq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 represent the density parameter for the matter field and the hubble parameter at present in the transformed frame respectively . + next",
    "we make an ansatz for the energy density of the scalar field as @xmath53 where @xmath54 indicates the present value of the energy density for the scalar field and @xmath55 , is a constant .",
    "+ the motivation behind this choice of @xmath56 is that for a matter dominated or a radiation dominated phase of the universe , the energy density of the universe varies as power law of the scale factor ; so in our toy model also we assume the energy density to bahave in a similar manner .",
    "apart from that since we are considering an interacting scenario in which the matter field is coupled to the scalar field we assume the energy density to be a function of the scalar field @xmath57 as well in the transformed frame .",
    "+ equation([feq1 ] ) then gives @xmath58\\ ] ] differentiating the above equation w.r.to . @xmath59 and using equation ( [ heq ] ) , one can write @xmath60 integrating the above expression , one can obtain the form of the scalar field @xmath57 as ( see appendix a.1 ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 is the equation of state parameter defined in the einstein@xmath3s frame itself which we choose to be close to -1 as suggested by recent observations @xcite ; the approximate bound on @xmath64 is @xmath65 .",
    "as the range of allowed values of @xmath64 is very small , we choose @xmath64 to be almost a constant .",
    "also @xmath66 is the ratio between the density parameters for the scalar field and the matter field respectively . in order to maintain the positivity of the scalar field",
    ", we can limit the range of values of @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 , or one can make the constant of integration @xmath69 sufficiently large so as to compensate for the negative term .",
    "it is evident from equations ( [ rhom ] ) , ( [ rhophi ] ) and ( [ phieq ] ) that @xmath67 can not be equal to @xmath70 as because in that case de will not be distinguishable from dark matter .",
    "also in that scenario we will obtain @xmath71 which indicates that the scalar field obtained is not dynamical in nature .",
    "now , using equation ( [ feq2 ] ) , one can obtain the expression for the deceleration parameter @xmath5 ( in terms of redshift @xmath72 ) as @xmath73\\ ] ] now if we plot @xmath5 as a function of @xmath72 , it shows that @xmath5 enters into a negative value regime from a positive value at around @xmath74 which is quite reasonable and within the range suggested by experimental data @xcite .",
    "also , the expression for the potential @xmath75 is obtained as +   + @xmath76 @xmath77}^{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\epsilon - 3 } } e^{-\\gamma(\\phi - \\phi_{0})}\\ ] ]        figure ( [ figv1 ] ) shows the plot of @xmath78 vs. @xmath57 for different values of @xmath67 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "it is evident from the graph that the nature of the potential remains the same for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "+            also , the expressions for the energy densities for matter and scalar field are given by @xmath81}^{-{\\gamma}c}\\\\ { \\bar{\\rho}}_{\\phi}(z ) = { \\bar{\\rho}}_{{\\phi}0}~{{a}}_{0}^{-\\epsilon}{(1 + z)}^{\\epsilon}{\\left[1 + \\kappa~{{a}}_{0}^{3-\\epsilon}{(1 + z)}^{\\epsilon - 3}\\right]}^{-{\\gamma}c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the redshift parameter given by @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the present value of the scale factor in the transformed frame .",
    "+    figure ( [ figrho1 ] ) shows the plot of energy densities for the scalar and the matter field as a function of @xmath72 for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "it has been found that the nature of the plot does not change much with the variation of the value of @xmath67 .",
    "it is evident from the graph that the scalar field starts dominating over the matter field at around @xmath84 and at present ( @xmath85 the dynamics of the universe is dominated by the scalar field .",
    "+ again the expressions for the density parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 for matter and scalar field comes out as @xmath88        figure ( [ figomega ] ) shows the plot of density parameter for the scalar field and the matter field for @xmath89 .",
    "it has been found that the nature of the plot is insensitive to slight variation of the value of @xmath67 .",
    "+      in model i , we have seen that in this interacting scenario , we could obtain a smooth transition from deceleration to acceleration phase of the universe which is essential for the structure formation .",
    "obviously one would be interested to check whether it is possible to obtain an analytical solution for various cosmological parameters for a toy model of the universe in which this transition from deceleration to acceleration is already incorporated .",
    "+ keeping this in mind , we make an ansatz regarding the functional form for the time - evolution of the scale factor @xmath59 as @xmath90^{\\beta}\\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath91 , @xmath92 are positive constants and @xmath93 is present value of the scale factor .",
    "the reason for this choice is that @xmath94 function has the obvious feature of providing a transition in the deceleration parameter @xmath5 because for small @xmath95 , @xmath96 and for large @xmath95 , @xmath97 and thus depending on the value of the parameter @xmath92 , one can obtain transition from decelerated to accelerated phase of expansion of the universe .",
    "infact this type of trigonometric functions have already found applications in solving many dark energy problems @xcite .",
    "+ in terms of redshift , the expression for the hubble parameter is given by + @xmath98 from equation([qeq ] ) , one can readily obtain the expression for the deceleration parameter as + @xmath99\\ ] ] so , if we plot @xmath100 as a function of @xmath72 for @xmath101 , the graph shows a transition from deceleration to acceleration at around @xmath102 .",
    "infact as discussed earlier , it is evident from equation ( [ qeq ] ) that such transition is obvious feature of @xmath103 function since @xmath104 for large @xmath105 and @xmath106 for small @xmath105 .",
    "+ from equation ( [ phicons ] ) , one can obtain @xmath107 as @xmath108 where @xmath45 is the constant of integration and @xmath109 .",
    "+ now using equations ( [ feq2 ] ) and ( [ qeq ] ) , the potential @xmath110 can be written as @xmath111 differentiating the above equation w.r.to @xmath95 , one can obtain @xmath112 then equation ( [ mattercons ] ) along with equations ( [ rhobar ] ) and ( [ vprime ] ) yields , @xmath113 which in turn yields ( see appendix a.2 ) @xmath114}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the constant of integration . + while arriving at equation ( [ phi ] ) , we make an assumption @xmath118 so that @xmath119 .",

    "the constant @xmath123 where @xmath117 is an arbitrary constant of integration and thus can be made sufficiently large to satisfy the above mentioned criteria .",
    "obviously this toy model is restricted in some sense but under the conditions imposed it can provide an exact solution for the scalar field under this interacting scenario .",

    "infact the approximate bound on the equation of state parameter ( @xmath135 or @xmath138 ) is @xmath140 ( see references @xcite ) .",
    "so the toy model that we considered is found to be in good agreement with the observational data and favours a cosmological constant model .",

    "we have plotted the graphs for @xmath167 but we have seen that even though we change the value of @xmath172 little bit within the bound @xmath173 as imposed by recent observations @xcite , this does not produce any significant change on the bounds .",

    "we have shown that the form of interaction chosen was not ad - hoc , rather it appeared as a result of some suitable conformal transformation .",
    "we have considered two toy models describing the evolution of the universe and in both the cases it has been found that during the evolution the universe undergoes an early phase of decelerated expansion @xmath174 followed by a late time accelerated expansion phase @xmath175 . this is a must for the structure formation of the universe so that the universe evolves to the same form as it looks today .",

    "although there are issues regarding the interconversion between the einstein s frame and jordan s frame , such as the geodesic equation is no longer valid in einstein s frame ; but things are fine as long as one sticks to any one of these frames and all the relevant parameters are defined in the same frame .",
    "+ we have calculated the various parameters of the model in the transformed version of the theory .",
    "we have also shown that the results obtained are consistent with the various observational values as mentioned earlier ; e.g. : in our model we have chosen the value of the parameter @xmath176 which makes @xmath177 which is consistent with the solar system type experiments which puts the limit on @xmath0 as @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "also in model i , we have considered @xmath135 to be almost a constant ( @xmath179 or so ) which is also consistent with the values suggested by @xcite . however , for model ii , we have chosen @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath176 and we have shown that the results obtained are not vary sensitive to these values .",

    "it has been found that the values of various parameters of the models which were chosen for analytical results are well fitted in the @xmath165 and @xmath166 confidence contours .",
    "+ so , such an interacting model , where the source of interaction is not ad - hoc , can give rise to an effective solution for the _ coincidence problem _ and also can provide solutions for many other cosmological problems .",
    "in this paper , we have considered two ansatz so as to obtain exact solutions for various cosmological parameters ; however there are infinite number of possibilities and one can generate various effective cosmological models from such an interacting scenario which may provide even better fit to the available observational data .",
