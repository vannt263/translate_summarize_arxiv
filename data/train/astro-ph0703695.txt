    "@xmath1 carinae is a massive luminous blue variable ( lbv ) with a high mass loss rate , which suffered several episodes of large mass loss ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ) .",
    "it presents also periodic spectroscopic events that led to the fading of the high excitation lines and a decrease in the continuum emission ( damineli 1996 ) .",
    "the last event , predicted for epoch 2003.5 , was duly observed at wavelengths ranging from radio to x - rays , through intense follow up campaigns ( fernndez lajs et al .",

    "although it does not remain any doubt about the strict periodicity of the spectroscopic events , the 2003.5 occurrence did not help elucidate their true nature . moreover , the high quality data allowed the discovery of new features , like ( i ) a sharp peak in the 7 mm radio emission , coincident with the spectroscopic event and superposed to the general weakening trend ( abraham et al .",
    "2005a ) , ( ii ) the identification of the heii @xmath0 recombination line , which reached very large intensity before disappearing ( steiner & damineli 2004 ) , and ( iii ) the latitude dependence of this emission ( stahl et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the early models proposed to explain the spectroscopic events postulated the ejection of shells from the stellar surface ( zanella , wolf & stahl 1984 ) but the periodicity reported by damineli ( 1996 ) in the intensity of the hei @xmath310830 line as well as in the radial velocity of the pa@xmath4 and pa@xmath5 lines gave strong support to the existence of a binary companion to @xmath1 carinae , moving in a highly eccentric orbit ( damineli , conti & lopes 1997 , davidson 1997 , damineli et al .",
    "the nature of the secondary star , assumed to be a wr with a strong wind , was recently confirmed by iping et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from data obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ satellite .",
    "the period of the binary system is very well determined but the other orbital parameters are controversial .",
    "the main reason is that the stellar photosphere , from which the orbital radial velocities are usually determined , is not visible in any of the stars . assuming that the radial velocity of the paschen lines reflects the orbital motion of the primary star",
    ", the best fitting orbital parameters resulted in eccentricities between 0.6 and 0.8 , with the ellipse major axis forming a small angle with the line of sight , and @xmath1 carinae positioned between the observer and the companion star during periastron passage ( damineli et al .",
    "1997 , davidson 1997 ) . besides",
    ", the orbital plane was always assumed to coincide with the homunculus equator .",
    "this orientation was appropriate to explain the fading of the x - ray flux during periastron passage , which would be absorbed by the dense @xmath1 carinae wind ( pittard et al .",
    "1998 ; corcoran et al . 2001 ; pittard & corcoran 2002 ) but it failed to explain the disappearance of the high excitation lines ( davidson et al .",

    "2004 ) .",
    "other phenomena , like a phase dependent asymmetry in the intensity of the uv emission reflected in the homunculus , reported by smith et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , was attributed to the shadow of the primary star on the light of the secondary , in a model that requires the major axis of the orbit to be perpendicular to the line of sight .    finally , @xmath2 observations , with higher spatial resolution than those obtained by damineli et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2000 ) with ground based telescopes , could not reproduce the expected mean velocities of the lines at some of the orbital phases ( davidson et al .",
    "2000 ) .    on the other hand , from a more pragmatic point of view we must consider that , although @xmath1 carinae is probably one of the most massive stars known at the present time , the properties of the binary system it belongs to must be similar to those of others formed by wr and o stars , like wr@xmath6 , wr@xmath7 , wr@xmath8 and wr@xmath9 ( monnier , tuthill & danchi 2001 ; cohen & vogel 1978 , williams ; kidger & van der hucht 2001 ; kato et al . 2002 )",
    "based on these considerations , falceta - gonalves , jatenco - pereira & abraham ( 2005 , paper i ) showed that in the @xmath1 carinae binary system near periastron passage , dust can be formed and grow very fast in the contact surface formed by wind - wind collision .",
    "this dust , as it moves away from the stars , could absorb not only the x - rays but also the uv radiation , like in a shell ejection . for this scenario to be effective",
    ", the secondary star must be located between @xmath1 carinae and the observer at periastron passage , implying that the broad emission line velocities do not represent the true orbital motion .    in a similar way ,",
    "other binary systems , like wr@xmath10 , present broadened emission lines with phase dependent velocities and profiles ; these lines are supposedly formed in the shocked material that flows along the contact surface of the colliding winds ( seggewiss 1974 ; luhrs 1997 ; hill et al .",

    "falceta - gonalves , jatenco - pereira & abraham ( 2006 ) were able to reproduce the line profiles and mean velocities of the ciii @xmath35696 lines of the br22 system , assuming constant flow velocity along the wind contact surface and including turbulence and finite opacity in their calculations . in the present paper",

    "we discuss the implications of the orbital model on the observational properties at other wavelengths ; a summary of the results is presented in section 5 .",
    "steiner & damineli ( 2004 ) identified the heii @xmath34686 line in the spectra of @xmath1 carinae at epochs near the 2003.5 spectroscopic event .",
    "they found that the line profile changed with the phase of the secondary orbit and that its mean velocity varied systematically between -400 km s@xmath11 and -100 km",
    "s@xmath11 , reaching positive values near periastron passage . the light curve was similar to that of x - rays , with the equivalent width becoming very large before fading .",
    "the authors argued that the heii present in the dense stellar winds could be ionized by the uv and soft x - rays emitted by the shocked material in the wind - wind collision region , producing the heii @xmath34686 line during recombination .",
    "the line was also detected in high spatial resolution @xmath2 observations by martin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who claimed that the energy in the form of soft x - rays and uv radiation is not enough to produce , by photoionization , the amount of he@xmath12 necessary to obtain the @xmath34686 line luminosity .",
    "they suggested instead that ionization could be produced by collisions in the shocked material itself , the shock being either produced by wind - wind collision or by matter ejected from the primary star at the low excitation phase .",
    "a completely different model was proposed by soker ( 2001 , 2004 ) .",
    "he assumed that in the binary system , the secondary accretes matter from @xmath1 carinae ; in this scenario , the homunculus was formed in the 1840 great eruption by a bipolar jet originated in the secondary star .",
    "presently , matter would be accreted during each periastron passage , the wind of the secondary star would not reach its terminal velocity before colliding with the primary s wind , and the stagnation point would get closer to the secondary ; it is in this region that the heii @xmath34686 line would be formed .",
    "eventually the accretion would shut down the secondary wind , producing the spectroscopic events .",
    "this model , however , fails to explain other phenomena , like the `` shell - like '' effect , the recombination of the disk material that results in the fading of the radio emission , and the superimposed 7 mm peak emission ( abraham et al .",
    "2005a ) .    finally , scattering into the line of sight of the heii @xmath34686 line photons by the homunculus",
    "suggests that the emission is latitude dependent .",
    "in fact , there is a location in the nebula , labeled fos4 , which gives a reflected pole - on view of the stellar wind , with a time delay of about 20 days relative to the direct view ( meaburn , wolstencroft & walsh 1987 , davidson et al 2001 , smith et al .",
    "observations with the vlt ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) showed line profiles different from those obtained by direct observation , even when corrected by travel time and doppler effects due to the expansion of the homunculus ( stahl et al .",
    "none of the models proposed up to the present addresses this issue .",
    "in this paper we will assume that the heii @xmath0 line is formed in the shocked material , as also pointed out by martin et al .",
    "this scenario was already proposed to explain the variation with orbital phase of other broadened line profiles in several binary systems formed by wolf - rayet and o - type stars ( eg . seggewiss 1974 , luhrs 1997 ) .",
    "our model assumes that the shocked material flows with constant velocity at both sides of the conic contact surface , where the momenta of the two winds balance each other .",
    "the high temperature plasma ( @xmath13 k ) emits at x - ray energies ; when the wind density is high , radiative losses cool down the gas generating a range of temperatures and densities , favoring the production of turbulence .",
    "lines can be formed under such conditions ; their profile can be calculated from the projection of the flow velocity in the direction of the line of sight , which is different at different orbital phases .",
    "falceta - gonalves , abraham & jatenco - pereira ( 2006 ) have discussed extensively this dependence ; in the absence of absorption , the line profile presents two peaks for most phases , but the blueshifted peak dominates when the emission of the receding part of the flow is absorbed . in @xmath1 carinae , because of the highly eccentric orbit , the density of the shocked material becomes very high near periastron passage , radiative cooling is very fast and grain formation can occur at the contact surface , justifying the inclusion of absorption in the calculation of the line profiles .",
    "the contact surface geometry is described by the equation :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the distance between the stars ; @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the distances of the primary and secondary stars to the contact surface , respectively , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the mass loss rates of primary and the secondary stars , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 their respective wind velocities .",
    "asymptotically , this surface can be approximated by a cone with an opening angle @xmath23 , which depends only on the parameter @xmath1 ( luo , mccray & mac - low 1990 ; stevens , blondin & pollock ) .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath24 of the shocked winds , projected into the line of sight @xmath25 is given by :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the inclination of the orbital plane with respect to the line of sight , @xmath28 is the cone azimuthal angle and @xmath29 is the angle between the cone axis and the projection of the line of sight on the orbital plane .    to calculate the line profile , we introduced local turbulence at each emitting fluid element , as a gaussian distribution of velocities around the central velocity @xmath25 with a dispersion @xmath30 ; the intensity as a function of the velocity @xmath31 can be calculated from :    @xmath32e^{-\\tau(\\alpha ) } d\\alpha ,   \\medskip\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is a constant that depends on the line intensity at each phase angle @xmath29 , and @xmath34 is the optical depth , which is zero for the elements in front of the contact surface and has a constant value @xmath35 for the emission produced behind it .",
    "therefore , besides the orbital parameters , three quantities are needed to reproduce the heii @xmath34686 line profiles obtained by steiner and damineli ( 2004 ) , and martin et al .",

    "in the previous sections we showed that a very good fitting can be obtained for the heii @xmath0 line profiles and mean line velocities using the orbital parameters derived in paper ii from the 7 mm light curve during the 2003.5 spectroscopic event ; however , changes in the orbital inclination , from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , could be compensated by changes in the area of the emitting cone and still explain the mm - wave observations .",
    "here , we also found that making small changes in the flow velocity and turbulence , a satisfactory fitting to the phase dependent profiles of the heii @xmath0 line and their mean velocity could be obtained for other orbital inclinations .",

    "at the same time , the emission of the secondary star and its wind will become directly visible , explaining the dramatic change in the uv spectra obtained with @xmath69 satellite ( iping et al .",

    "( 2004 ) suggested that this effect is due to the secondary star shadow on the primary radiation .",

    "for that reason we assumed infinite optical depth at the contact surface , meaning that only the shock material at the observer s side of the surface contributed to the formation of the line profile .",
    "we also assumed that the flow velocity is constant and introduced turbulence with a gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "we constructed model profiles and compare them with the @xmath2 observations reported by martin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for different orbital phases , assuming a period of 2022.1 days ( steiner & damineli ( 2004 ) and using the orbital parameters derived in paper ii from the 7 mm light curve ( eccentricity @xmath41 , orbital inclination @xmath38 , epoch of conjunction june 29 , 2003 , angle between periastron and conjunction @xmath70 .",
    "we found that the flow velocity and turbulence dispersion that gave the best fitting to the data were @xmath71 km s@xmath11 and @xmath72 km s@xmath11 , respectively . with these parameters we were able to reproduce the line mean velocity as a function of the orbital phase measured by steiner & damineli ( 2004 ) .",
    "we found that with small changes in the flow velocity and turbulence , it is also possible to obtain a good fitting to the line profiles for other inclinations and apperture angles of the contact surface cone .",
    "we also modeled the profiles of the heii @xmath34686 line scattered by the southern polar cap of the homunculus into the line of sight ( stahl et al .",
    "2005 , martin et al .",
    "2006 ) . since the model line profiles depend on the orbital phase and orientation of the observer relative to the plane of the orbit , we determined these parameters by fitting the models to the observations while fixing the angle between the observer and the axis of the homunculus in @xmath53 .",
    "although the model presented here is very simple , it reproduced very well the observations and allowed us to explain other observational features , like the `` shell like effect '' , postulated to explain the optical and uv light curves ( zanella et al .",

    "<S> we modeled the heii @xmath0 line profiles observed in the @xmath1 carinae binary system close to the 2003.5 spectroscopic event , assuming that they were formed in the shocked gas that flows at both sides of the contact surface formed by wind - wind collision . </S>",
    "<S> we used a constant flow velocity and added turbulence in the form of a gaussian velocity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we allowed emission from both the primary and secondary shocks but introduced infinite opacity at the contact surface , implying that only the side of the contact cone visible to the observer contributed to the line profile . using the orbital parameters of the binary system derived from the 7 mm light curve during the last spectroscopic event ( paper ii ) we were able to reproduce the line profiles obtained with the @xmath2 at different epochs , as well as the line mean velocities obtained with ground based telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> a very important feature of our model is that the line profile depends on the inclination of the orbital plane ; we found that to explain the latitude dependent mean velocity of the line , scattered into the line of sight by the homunculus , the orbit can not lie in the homunculus equatorial plane , as usually assumed . </S>",
    "<S> this result , together with the relative position of the stars during the spectroscopic events , allowed us to explain most of the observational features , like the variation of the `` purple haze '' with the orbital phase , and to conciliate the x - ray absorption with the postulated shell effect used to explain the optical and uv light curves .    </S>",
