    "the lensing effect can be best described as a smoothing and a decrease of the amplitude of non - gaussianity power in the equilateral configuration of the bispectrum when @xmath96 and a subsequent increase in the bispectrum amplitude at small angular scales .    in figure  2 , we show two squeezed configurations ( @xmath97 ) of the bispectrum , with the short length fixed at either 10 ( left panel ) or 100 ( right panel ) , as a function of the multipole @xmath94 of one side with the third side fixed at either @xmath98 or @xmath99 . without lensing , a comparison of figure  1 and figure  2 reveals a well - known result in the literature that the local type of the cmb bispectrum is dominated by squeezed configurations with one small side and two large sides for the bispectrum mode shape in the multipole space . with lensing , the amplitude of the squeezed configurations is significantly reduced when two of the sides have lengths @xmath100 in the multipole space .",
    "this can be again described as a smoothing effect with lensing by the intervening large - scale structure ; removing or `` washing out '' the primordial non - gaussian signature in the cmb map at angular scales below a few arcminutes .",

    "the removal of the non - gaussianity is associated with the squeezed configurations , which dominate the overall signal - to - noise ratio for the detection of the primary bispectrum without lensing .",
    "although non - gaussianity is reduced for the squeezed configurations , lensing leads to an increase in the amplitude of the bispectrum for equilateral configurations where @xmath101 .",
    "this increase , however , is insignificant in terms of the overall signal - to - noise ratio as the contribution to the cumulative signal - to - noise coming from these configurations is lower , owing to the higher variances associated with foregrounds and instrumental noise at these angular scales .    to further quantify this statement , we plot , in figure  3 , the signal - to - noise ratio calculated as @xmath102 where the noise variance calculation involves all contributions to the angular power spectrum with @xmath103 where we include the lensed cmb power spectrum ( @xmath104 ) , secondary anisotropies ( @xmath105 ) , and the noise power spectrum ( @xmath106 ) for both wmap and planck . for secondaries ,",

    "as can be seen from the left panel of figure  3 , there is an overall reduction in the signal - to - noise ratio when @xmath110 .",
    "this difference comes from the previously described decrease in the amplitude of the non - gaussianity in squeezed configurations of the bispectrum with lensing imposed .",
    "to further understand the differences in the signal - to - noise ratio of the lensed primary bispectrum , we plot , in figure  4 , the quantity @xmath111 with two separate estimates for @xmath112 and @xmath113 to estimate this quantity without and with lensing , respectively .",

    "<S> the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) bispectrum is a well - known probe of the non - gaussianity of primordial perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> just as the intervening large - scale structure modifies the cmb angular power spectrum through weak gravitational lensing , the cmb primary bispectrum generated at the last scattering surface is also modified by lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the lensing modification to the cmb bispectrum and show that lensing leads to an overall decrease in the amplitude of the primary bispectrum at multipoles of interest between 100 and 2000 through additional smoothing introduced by lensing . since weak lensing is not accounted for in current estimators of the primordial non - gaussianity parameter , the existing measurements of @xmath0 of the local model with wmap out to @xmath1 is biased low by about 6% . for a high resolution experiment such as planck , the lensing modification to the bispectrum must be properly included when attempting to estimate the primordial non - gaussianity or the bias will be at the level of 30% . for planck , </S>",
    "<S> weak lensing increases the minimum detectable value for the non - gaussianity parameter of the local type @xmath0 to 7 from the previous estimate of about 5 without lensing . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum detectable value of @xmath0 for a cosmic variance limited experiment is also increased from less than 3 to @xmath2 5 . </S>"
