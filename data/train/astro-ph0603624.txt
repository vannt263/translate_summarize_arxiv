    "astronomical data based on light curves of distant ia supernova @xcite , anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation @xcite and the matter power spectrum of large scale structure @xcite agrees with an accelerated universe which is spatially flat and dominated by a dark energy component with a contribution of @xmath1 .",
    "the remaining @xmath2 corresponds to a cold dark matter component , while the contribution of radiation and baryons is negligible . in order to account for an accelerated phase at the present epoch",
    ", the dark energy component must have a negative equation of state @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "the most favored scenario is the model with a cosmological constant @xmath0 giving @xmath5 ( we set the newtonian constant , @xmath6 , to one ) , called @xmath0cdm model .",
    "however there are other interesting models introduced in order to mimic the current contribution of the dark energy component",
    ". some of the most relevant models are i ) dark energy with @xmath3 where @xmath7 , ii ) dynamical dark energy ( dde ) where the equation of state is a function of time @xmath8 , iii ) chaplygin gas @xcite with an equation of state of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 , a consequence of @xmath11 and finite age of the universe , iv ) higher order gravity @xcite and v ) quintessence models @xcite which introduce the concept of scalar fields ruled by a potential @xmath12 which at the present time mimics a cosmological constant as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the value of the field at the minimum of the potential .",
    "although in principle one could translate one model into the other , it is worth noting that quintessence models have been not only successful when trying to interpret the cosmological constant but also in explaining the well known problems of standard cosmology ( i.e , the horizon problem , the homogeneity problem and fine - tunning problems ) @xcite .",
    "+ after the discovery of the current state of the universe ( the fact that we are dominated by the cosmological constant ) , several question have arisen .",
    "the inferred values for cosmological parameters such as the density parameter associated with the cold dark matter @xmath15 and the dark energy component associated with e.g.the cosmological constant @xmath16 @xcite lead to the coincidence problem .",
    "one such coincidence emerges if we compare the scales of length and time for the universe with values set by the cosmological constant .",
    "the length ( time ) scale set by @xmath0 is defined as @xmath17 which corresponds to @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "these scales coincide with the _ size _ ( age ) of the universe which is proportional to the hubble s distance ( time ) @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "essentially the coincidence is that we are living in an epoch dominated by @xmath0 where e.g. @xmath22 , a relation possible only at certain times of the expansion .",
    "other aspects of some astrophysical scales set by @xmath0 can be found in @xcite .",
    "nowadays the origin of the cosmological constant and related problems are a very active field of modern physics @xcite .    in standard cosmology",
    "the universe is considered an isotropic and homogeneous fluid at large scales .",
    "this allows us to describe it by the robertson - friedmann - walker metric @xmath23 where @xmath24 represents the curvature , @xmath25 is the metric on a @xmath26-sphere and @xmath27 is the dimensionless scale factor .",
    "this factor determines the kinematics of the universe though the einstein field equations . for a spatially flat universe one obtains the friedmann equation @xmath28 and acceleration equation @xmath29 .",
    "the time variable @xmath30 is the red - shift defined as @xmath31 .",
    "the functions @xmath32 are given as @xmath33,\\ ] ] we have only considered contributions from a cold dark matter component and vacuum energy density .",
    "the function @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 which follows from the energy - density conservation law @xmath36 for the dark energy component @xmath37 . as pointed before , the case @xmath38 corresponds to the cosmological constant @xmath39 .",
    "alternative models with @xmath40 lead to future singularities in the so - called phantom regime @xcite .",
    "local effects of dark energy have been investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "we explore these effects of the background through the newtonian limit of einstein field equations @xcite from which one can derive a modified poisson s equation @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the overdensity that gives rise to the gravitational source of the potential @xmath43 .",
    "the total energy density within the clustered configuration is a contribution of the cold dark matter in the background and the collapsed fraction , i.e , @xmath44 .",
    "the extra - term @xmath45 in poisson s equation reduces to @xmath46 for @xmath38 if we neglect the contribution from the cold dark matter component .",
    "this is the standard newtonian limit .",
    "the more general limit retaining also the time ( @xmath30 ) dependent parts is derived e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the solution for the potential can be simplified as @xmath47 which defines the newton - hooke spacetime @xcite for @xmath38 and @xmath48 at the present time .",
    "two effects combine in order that we are allowed to make this approximation at the present time : i)the red - shift - dependence @xmath49 and the ratio @xmath50 with @xmath51 the mean density of the configuration .",
    "this ratio was @xmath52 at the moment of virialisation .",
    "+ once one knows the solution of poisson equation @xmath53 , one can write the euler s equation for the overdensity as @xmath54 , ( neglecting @xmath55 ) , where @xmath56 is the dispersion tensor . taking spatial moments on euler s equation",
    "one can derive the second order tensor virial equation @xcite as @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2t_{ik}-|{\\mathcal{w}}_{ik}^{\\rm grav}| + h_{0}^{2}\\omega_{\\rm vac } h_{2}(z){\\mathcal{i}}_{ik}+ \\pi_{ik},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected surface integrals ( this is not the case when we consider configurations with a non zero pressure at the boundary or if we consider non radial external forces , as electromagnetic forces ) .",
    "the first line of ( [ tvir ] ) is the second derivative with respect to time of the inertial tensor in dependence of the red - shift where we have used the friedmann equation ( @xmath58 ) and the acceleration equation ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the second line of ( [ tvir ] ) is the dynamical information encoded in the virial equation .",
    "the quantities involved in this expression are defined as to @xmath51 . ]",
    "@xmath60 corresponds to the moment of inertia tensor , the kinetic energy tensor , the gravitational potential energy tensor and the dispersion tensor .",
    "+ by taking the trace on eq .",
    "( [ tvir ] ) and assuming the virial graviational equilibrium we obtain the most known form for the virial theorem : @xmath61 ) and so on for the other terms .",
    "note then that the effects of a positive cosmological constant are _ coupled _ to the moment of inertia which depends on the density profile ( or the equation of state ) and the geometry of the configuration .",
    "hence , these two parameters ( density and geometry ) become relevant in order to determine sizable effects of a vacuum energy density .",
    "it is to be expected that some effects due to @xmath0 will show up only if the density of the object is low .",
    "however , we will see that geometry helps to enhance such effects .",
    "+ in order to describe a general consequence of eq.([virial ] ) , we write the total kinetic energy as @xmath62 .",
    "since this quantity is positive defined , we conclude that the state of equilibrium is characterized by the inequality @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a characteristic parameter with units of density ( such as the man density or the central density ) and @xmath65 , together with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 depends on the geometry of the configurations and/or the parameters specifying internal structure such as the equation of state .",
    "the tensor virial equation is trivially satisfied for spherically symmetric configuration ( in the absence of electromagnetic fields or non radial forces ) since @xmath69 and @xmath70 . therefore eq.([virial ] ) is sufficient in order describe configurations with this geometry .      for constant density ( with @xmath71 )",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath72 . in this case",
    "the effects of @xmath73 are not enhanced because of this geometrical factor .",
    "however , other effects can be shown to exist .",
    "indeed , the presence of a cosmological constant allows the existence of a maximal virial radius of a spherical configuration in virial equilibrium in the limit when @xmath74 . the radius at virial equilibrium can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ virial ] ) , as the solution of the cubic equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the mass of the average member of the configuration , @xmath78 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath79 is the temperature .",
    "the solution for the radius at virial equilibrium reads as @xcite @xmath80r_{\\rm max},\\ ] ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the maximum radius allowed for astrophysical / cosmological structures . in astrophysical terms",
    "we have @xmath83 this length scale is a combination of a cosmological length scale defined by the cosmological constant @xmath84 and a pure astrophysical scale , i.e , the schwarszchild s radius @xmath85 .",
    "this combination gives rise to a relevant astrophysical scale .",
    "this new scale with a replacement @xmath86 in ( [ sca3 ] ) also appears when studying the motion of test particles in the einstein - de sitter space time @xcite and represents the last bound orbit around the source of gravity with mass @xmath77 .",
    "in other words , eq .",
    "( [ sca3 ] ) would imply that the cosmological constant sets the typical scale for bound configurations .",
    "some examples are welcome : for @xmath87 i.e. a typical mass of a globular clusters ( the tight connection between galaxies and globular clusters is that the latter are important in galaxy formation ) we get @xmath88 kpc , whereas for a galaxy mass , @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90 kpc .",
    "the numerical outcomes correspond to the radius a typical galaxy in the first example , while the second one agrees with numerical values for the extension of a galaxy cluster .",
    "the effects on non - homogeneous spherical configurations have been explored by considering polytropic configurations characterized by a barotropic equation of state of the form @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the equation governing the behavior of the density of polytropic configurations with cosmological constant is the modified lane - emden equation written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . as a main effect of a positive @xmath0",
    "one can demonstrate that not all the configurations with a polytropic equation of state have a defined radius , even for @xmath98 , as can be seen in fig.[lane](i.e .",
    "not all values of @xmath99 leads to a solution @xmath100 such that for some @xmath101 one gets @xmath102 ) .",
    "we generalize the equilibrium criteria given for homogeneous configurations by identifying @xmath103 and writing @xmath104 where the factor @xmath105 takes different values for different indexes @xmath99 .",
    "some examples are @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "characteristic quantities and concepts such as the radius and the mass as well as the stability criteria get modified in the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , the radius of such configurations can be written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the radius that one would obtain with @xmath112 and @xmath113 is an enhancement factor which depends on the polytropic index @xmath99 and the ratio @xmath114 .",
    "some numerical values are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 which shows that even for spherical configurations effects are found for low density configurations with different values of @xmath99 .",
    "worth noting is the case of the isothermal sphere i.e. the case @xmath119 .",
    "the isothermal sphere is an often employed model in astrophysics @xcite . from figure 1",
    "we can see that including @xmath0 the cases @xmath120 do not have a defined radius even in the asymptotic sense .",
    "therefore one can easily suspect that the extreme case of the isothermal sphere will display even bigger effects which is to say , sizable effects for larger density .",
    "this is indeed the case and the isothermal sphere is not a viable model ( with @xmath0 ) even at density comparable with galaxy densities @xcite .        the stability criteria for polytropic configurations can be derived via the virial theorem in two ways : one option is to develop lagrangian perturbations of the form @xmath121 ( where @xmath122 is the lagrangian displacement ) on the tensor virial equation and derive an equation for the oscillation frequency around equilibrium @xmath123 , such that stability would implies @xmath124 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "another option is to solve for the mass of the configuration as a function of the central density .",
    "stability ( instability ) stands for @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) @xcite .",
    "both ways lead us to write a critical value for the polytropic index such that polytropic configuration are stable if @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the critical polytropic index @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath129 depends on the ratio @xmath114 through integrals of the lane - emden function @xcite which in turn depends on the index @xmath99 .",
    "hence , eq ( [ slope2 ] ) is a transcendental equation for the critical value of the polytropic index .",
    "nevertheless , eq.([slope2 ] ) is a generalization of stability criteria for homogeneous configurations under radial adiabatic perturbations with cosmological constant and can be written as @xmath130 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that by including the corrections due to general relativity , the critical value for @xmath131 is also modified as @xmath132 @xcite and hence for compact objects the correction to the critical polytropic index is stronger from the effects of general relativity than from the effects of the background , as expected .",
    "as mentioned before , the effects of a positive cosmological constant can be enhanced through the geometrical factor @xmath68 . as an example , we consider the virial theorem and solve for the velocity dispersion for arbitrary geometry and constant density .",
    "the final expression has the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 . in the last section we saw that for spherical and homogeneous systems @xmath72 and hence the correction",
    "is just @xmath135 which implies that a sizable effect could be reached only in systems with @xmath136 .",
    "on the other hand , for non - spherical configurations we can combine a low density feature with a highly non - spherical geometry in order to find sizable effects on realistic systems . for instance , for oblate and prolate homogeneous configurations these geometrical factor is written as @xcite @xmath137^{-1 }    \\stackrel { a_{3 } \\gg a_{1 }     } { \\to } \\frac{2}{3}{\\left(}\\frac{a_{3}}{a_{1}}{\\right)}^{3}\\left[\\ln{\\left(}\\frac{2a_{3}}{a_{1}}{\\right)}\\right]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the eccentricity for oblate configurations and @xmath139 the corresponding one for the prolate case . from eq.([a ] ) we see that very flat astrophysical objects we can gain several orders of magnitude of enhancement of the effect of @xmath73 .",
    "clearly we often encounter in the universe flat configurations such as elliptical galaxies , spiral disk galaxies , clusters of galaxies of different forms and finally superclusters which can have the forms of pancakes .",
    "of course , the more dilute the system is , the bigger the effect of @xmath0 .",
    "we can expect sizable effects for clusters and superclusters , even for very flat galaxies . regarding the latter ,",
    "low density galaxies like the nearly invisible galaxies are among other the best candidates . + in order to explore the effects of @xmath73 further we turn to the tensor virial equation for a rotating oblate configuration .",
    "writing @xmath140 as ( twice ) the rotational kinetic energy tensor and defining a coordinate system such that @xmath141 one gets the following expression for the angular velocity : @xmath142,\\ ] ] where @xmath143 corresponding to the angular velocity when @xmath144 given by the maclaurin formula ( see @xcite ) and @xmath145 .",
    "the function @xmath146 has been defined as @xmath147^{-1}.\\ ] ] as can be seen from these expressions , the vacuum energy density @xmath73 has a two effects on the angular velocity . in first case",
    ", it reduces the angular velocity with respect to the value @xmath143 especially at the local maximum ( see figure [ ag ] ) .",
    "this is not a small effect and can affect even galaxies . secondly , we see from eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) that in the limit @xmath148 one has @xmath149 , approaching @xmath150 for a very flat oblate configuration and not too dense matter .",
    "therefore , beyond the local maximum in @xmath151 the cosmological constant causes a steeper fall of @xmath151 towards @xmath152 . in passing we",
    "note that galaxy clusters exhibit rotating ellipsoidal configurations @xcite to which our results can be applied .",
    "+    [ ag ]     figure 2 shows the angular velocity and the ratio @xmath153 defined as the ratio of rotational over gravitational contributions i.e. @xmath154 versus the eccentricity @xmath155 .",
    "+ the tensor virial equation not only gives us the equation for angular velocity ( which can be also derived from euler s equation ) but also constrains the non - spherical geometries in equilibrium .",
    "that is , not all values of eccentricities represent configurations with rotation which are in equilibrium @xcite . for instance , with @xmath112 only two configurations are allowed to have angular velocity along the minor axis and to be in equilibrium , namely , the maclaurin solution ( oblate ) with @xmath156 and the jacobi solution ( triaxial ) with @xmath157 where @xmath158 ( the value @xmath159 is known as the bifurcation point ) . with the inclusion of @xmath73 in the virial equation , we find two effects @xcite . in first place , we see that the bifurcation point becomes a increasing function of @xmath160 .",
    "secondly , we find a second bifurcation point @xmath161 such that for @xmath162 , the only allowed solution is again the maclaurin solution .",
    "+ similar results are found for triaxial configurations which can be reduced to prolate ellipsoids and angular velocity in the direction of the largest axis which is called minor axis rotation .",
    "this is rare case , but can nevertheless be found in nature @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider the full contribution of the background . this is to say we examine how virialized matter responses to a time dependent external force representing the expansion .",
    "we assume that the shape of the system remains constant even under the effects of a time dependent background .",
    "it is clear that a time dependent term in the virial equation implies that certain internal properties of the matter distribution ( like angular velocity and internal velocity ) also change in time , in such a way as to maintain a constant volume and density .",
    "we concentrate here on the effects on angular velocity . using equation ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) and assuming the left hand side of ( 3 ) to be zero ( i.e. we assume gravitational equilibrium ) we obtain @xmath163.\\ ] ] where @xmath164 is the angular velocity calculated without any dark energy background . as mentioned above in order to maintain a constant shape in a expanding background the system has to pay the price that its angular velocity will change with time , according to the dominant component of the background .",
    "if we neglect the cdm component with respect to the density of the system , we see that the dark energy component makes the angular velocity to decrease in order for the system to maintain equilibrium since @xmath165 . at @xmath166",
    "we get @xmath167 .",
    "an extreme situation would be reached if @xmath168 so that @xmath169 . for @xmath170",
    "this would require @xmath171 , which is a very diluted configuration .",
    "for higher eccentricities ( say @xmath172 ) one would need a system with @xmath173 which is still a rather low value . in the @xmath0cdm model @xmath174",
    "is reached at a redshift given by @xmath175^{1/3}-1 $ ] .",
    "for realistic examples as @xmath176 ( this represents the case of a configurations with @xmath177 which is the typical value predicted by the nonlinear collapse model ) an allowed redshift could be reached if @xmath155 is very close to @xmath150 .",
    "this clearly means the extreme situation of @xmath178 requires extreme flat objects . in fig .",
    "[ g1 ] we show the behavior of @xmath179 as a function of the redshift with @xmath180 and @xmath181 for three different values of the equation of state for dark energy .",
    "it is clear that the effects associated with a cosmological constant are stronger than the ones associated with other dark energy models , but in general those effects are small for realistic values of @xmath160 as the used in the figure .",
    "we would have to measure the angular velocity at different red - shifts very exactly to see an effect over a range of @xmath30 .",
    "however , the difference between the models is more significant .",
    "in the present work we investigated in detail the astrophysical relevance of the cosmological constant for equilibrium configurations . using the tensor and scalar virial equations and the lane - emden equation we could show that many astrophysical facets get modified by @xmath0 .",
    "an important aspect is the fact that @xmath0 introduces new relevant scales ( these scales would be zero if @xmath144 ) like the maximal virial volume defined by the maximal virial radius ( [ delta ] ) and the maximal extension of bound orbits .",
    "it is often assumed that superclusters with densities @xmath182 are not in equilibrium . with the inequality",
    "@xmath63 we have a precise tool to quantify this statement .",
    "indeed , the pancake structure of the superclusters lead us to the conclusion that they are even far away from the equilibrium state due to the factor @xmath68 which grows with the object s flatness . on the other hand we can apply the results also to low density clusters which are assumed to be virialized . depending on shape and density various observable , like internal velocity or angular velocity ,",
    "will get affected by the repulsive force induced by dark energy .",
    "the effects are bigger the large the geometry of the objects deviates from spherical symmetry and the lower the density of the object . finally , the response of the objects to epoch dependent expansion gets reflected also in a time dependent variation of some of their properties and the difference between different dark energy models becomes manifest .",
