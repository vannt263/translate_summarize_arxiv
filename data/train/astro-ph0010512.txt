    "combining the temperature change in the cosmic microwave background due to the sz effect and the x - ray emission observations , the angular distance to galaxy clusters , and consequently the hubble constant @xmath4 , can be derived .",
    "+ the sz effect is difficult to measure , since systematic errors can be important . for example , inagaki et al . (",
    "1995 ) analysed the reliability of the hubble constant measurement based on the sz effect .",
    "cooray ( 1998 ) showed that projection effects of clusters can lead incidence on the calculations of the hubble constant and the gas mass fraction , and hughes & birkinshaw ( 1998 ) as well as sulkanen ( 1999 ) pointed out , that galaxy cluster shapes can produce systematic errors on the measured value of @xmath4 .",
    "+ the aim of this contribution is to investigate the influence of extension , shape and temperature profile of the cluster gas distribution on the inferred value of @xmath4 . in section 2",
    "we recall the calculations for the determination of the hubble constant for a non - spherical geometry and finite extension of the galaxy cluster , and in section 3 we present a quantitative discussion on the incidence of these effects on the value of the hubble constant . in section 4 we give a short outlook .",
    "the @xmath5-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) is widely used in x - ray astronomy to parametrise the gas density profile in clusters of galaxies by fitting their surface brightness profile .",
    "nevertheless , fitting an aspherical distribution with a spherical @xmath5-model can lead to an important inaccuracy ( see inagaki et al .",
    "1995 ) . + fabricant et al .",
    "( 1984 ) showed a pronounced ellipticity for the cluster abell 2256 , indicating that the underlying density profile has to be aspherical .",
    "allen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) obtained the same conclusion for the profile of abell 478 , hughes et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for the coma cluster , neumann & bhringer ( 1997 ) and hughes & birkinshaw ( 1998 ) for cl0016 + 16 .",
    "+ given these observations , we assume an ellipsoidal @xmath5-model : , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as well as the characteristic lengths of the half axes of the ellipsoid @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are defined in units of the core radius @xmath11 . ]",
    "@xmath12^{-3 \\beta /2 } ~,\\label{eq : dp}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the electron number density at the center of the cluster and @xmath5 is a free fitting parameter which lies in the range @xmath14 .",
    "+ the compton parameter @xmath15 and the x - ray surface brightness @xmath16 depend on the temperature of the hot gas @xmath17 and the electron number density @xmath18 as follows @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the maximal extension of the hot gas along the line of sight in units of the core radius @xmath11 and the x - ray emissivity is assumed to be @xmath22 .",
    "we have chosen the line of sight along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "+ for a detailed calculation of the compton parameter and the x - ray surface brightness we refer to the paper by puy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) : @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24~ , \\label{eq : x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the beta and the incomplete beta - functions with the cut - off parameter @xmath25 given by : @xmath26 introducing the angular core radius @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the angular diameter distance of the cluster : @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the deceleration parameter , we can estimate the hubble constant from the ratio between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "if we choose the line of sight through the cluster center we get : @xmath33 ^ 2}{\\left [ b\\left(3\\beta- \\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right ) -b_m\\left(3\\beta-\\frac{1}{2 } , \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right]},\\ ] ] for a finite extension @xmath21 and , for an infinitely extended cluster , we get instead @xmath34 ^ 2 } { b(3 \\beta -\\frac{1}{2 } , \\frac{1}{2 } ) } , \\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a constant ( see puy et al .",
    "+ since @xmath16 and @xmath36 are observed quantities , the ratios @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in the following both set equal to the measured value @xmath39 .",
    "recently , mauskopf et al . ( 2000 ) determined the hubble constant from measurements of the x - ray emission and millimeter wavelength observations of the sz effect in the cluster abell 1835 with the sunyaev - zeldovich infrared experiment ( suzie ) multifrequency array receiver . assuming a spherical gas distribution with an isothermal equation of state , characterised by @xmath40 , @xmath41 kev and @xmath42 @xmath43 , they found a value of @xmath44 km s@xmath45 mpc@xmath45 for the hubble constant .",
    "+ if we suppose other physical characteristics for the cluster such as : finite extension , polytropic temperature profile or aspherical density distribution , we get of course different values for the @xmath15-parameter and the surface brightness , and so a relative error with respect to the _ classical configuration _ ( i.e. spherical distribution with infinite extension and isothermal temperature ) .",
    "thus , we define three kind of relative errors :    * @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the compton parameter for an infinite extension and @xmath48 for a finite cluster extension @xmath21 . here",
    "we consider an isothermal profile and a spherical distribution . *",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 is for an isothermal profile and @xmath51 is for a polytropic profile .",
    "we consider here a spherical distribution with infinite extension .",
    "* @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the compton parameter for a spherical distribution and @xmath54 is for an ellipsoidal distribution , both with infinite extension and isothermal temperature profile .",
    "similarly , we can define the relative error for the surface brightness @xmath16 . in the following",
    "we discuss the influence of the finite extension and the temperature and density profiles on the hubble constant , and compare the result with the value given by mauskopf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "since the hot gas in a cluster has a finite extension , each of the observed quantities , the compton parameter and the x - ray surface brightness , will be smaller than those estimated assuming @xmath55 .",
    "+ in puy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we have analysed the influence of this correction for the simplest cluster case : isothermal @xmath56-model with a spherical density profile ( i.e. @xmath57 ) , and a line of sight going through the cluster center ( i.e. @xmath58 ) . in table [ tab : exten ] we give the relative error on the compton @xmath15-parameter and the surface brightness for different finite extensions of the cluster . for a cluster with an extension of about 10 times the core radius @xmath11 ,",
    "the relative error with respect to the assumption of an infinite extension is only about 7 % for the compton parameter . for the x - ray brightness",
    "the relative error due to the finite extension is much smaller , for instance an error of about 4% is obtained , if the cluster has an extension of only 2 times @xmath11 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the effect on the hubble constant is shown in figure [ fig : obs3 ] for a cigar shaped ( i.e. prolate ) cluster .",
    "we consider four different lines of sight , @xmath59=(1,0 ) ; ( 1,1 ) ; ( 0,0 ) and ( 0,1 ) , given in units of the core radius @xmath11 . for a strong flattening ( i.e. @xmath60 )",
    "the value of the hubble constant gets substantially modified .",
    "in addition to our modifications , it should be noted that the commonly used expression for the fractional temperature decrement @xmath61 of the cosmic microwave background in clusters is based on the kompaneets equation , which is derived under the assumption of non - relativistic electrons .",
    "however , the existence of many high - temperature galaxy clusters led to the need of taking into account the relativistic corrections for the electrons ( rephaeli 1995 , rephaeli & yankovitch 1997 ) .",
    "nozawa et al . ( 2000 ) presented useful fitting formulae for these relativistic corrections based on the calculations of itoh et al .",
    "+ mito ( millimeter and infrared testa grigia observatory ) , a 2.6 m ground based telescope ( de petris et al .",
    "1996 ) , is currently dedicated to cosmological observations in particular to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect . as the first step",
    ", large and nearby clusters ( diameter @xmath62 5 arcminutes ) have been selected ; for example in a recent paper dalba et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have reported on the observations done on coma cluster ( abell 1656 , @xmath63 ) and their preliminary results .",
    "+ therefore , in the analysis of coming data , it will be essential to take into account the relativistic corrections for high - temperature clusters and the possible effects , due to finite extension , polytropic index and geometry , that we have discussed above .",
