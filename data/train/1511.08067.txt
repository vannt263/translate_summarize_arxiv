    "<S> while the probability distribution in the convoluted @xmath4-function is broadened and has some spectral weight at higher voltages , the @xmath34 distribution  only containing the interaction with the dissipative environment  sharply peaks at @xmath84 ( see fig.[fig_3]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the required condition @xmath85 , is violated for almost the entire conductance range as shown in fig.[fig_3]c . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with theory , since we operate the junction in a low impedance environment ( i.  e.  @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , thermal voltage fluctuations have to be included @xcite to correctly describe our data . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the @xmath81 values and results in an overall consistent picture between experiment and theory as well as the range of validity . </S>",

    "<S> we found that the experimentally determined values of the critical josephson current @xmath62 are equal to the theoretical values as calculated by using the ambegaokar - baratoff formula . </S>",
    "<S> the dcb regime , in which stm experiments are commonly operated , can , therefore , be used to directly determine local absolute values of the critical josephson current . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we experimentally determined the range of sequential cooper pair tunneling in which @xmath4-theory can be applied and observed indications for the crossover into the phase tunneling regime at @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with precise tuning of the involved energy scales ( @xmath19 , @xmath14 , @xmath18 ) , we can operate our stm in the optimal regime . </S>",
    "<S> our study presents new insights on the tunneling mechanisms in ultra - small josephson junctions , which lays the basis for the successful implementation of jstm as a probe for novel topological superconductors in the context of majorana fermions and for the ground state properties of unconventional superconductors .    </S>",
