    "the studies of open quantum systems range from loosely bound nuclei to quantum information and teleportation devices . quantum transport through open quantum systems has recently gained significant attention .",
    "the advent of nano - fabrication technology has opened new doors for studying quantum transport , in particular electronic transport .",
    "this area of research has further expanded with the inclusion of spin and thermodynamic degrees of freedom in the newborn fields of spitronics and spin - caloritronics . in nuclear physics , especially for short - lived nuclei currently in the center of interest , the structure and reactions are greatly influenced by the proximity of the continuum . in all such applications we have to deal with an open quantum system",
    "where the interaction between the bound states and the environment is not only taken into account but frequently presents the main object of study .    an appropriate mathematical framework for studying open quantum systems",
    "is provided by the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian , which was first introduced by feshbach @xcite in the context of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the framework goes beyond nuclear physics @xcite , it ranges from quantum biology to electronic transport in mesoscopic physics .",
    "recently @xcite , a quantum biological switch was demonstrated using the same mathematical formalism .",
    "transport properties in a periodic and disordered chains with symmetric @xcite and asymmetric @xcite coupling to the leads and signal transmission properties of a two - level atom , a qubit , inserted into a periodic chain @xcite are typical examples of numerous applications where the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian approach was shown to be a powerful tool .    a common feature for all open systems is the appearance of short - lived states at sufficiently strong coupling to the external world . these states are called super - radiant , analogous to the dicke super - radiant states in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "super - radiant states are broad resonances that occur as a result of the collectivization of the intrinsic states of the system due to their coupling through the common decay channels .",
    "this collective phenomenon was experimentally demonstrated in @xcite by using an ensemble of quantum dots . at the same time , the remaining ( `` trapped '' ) states become very long - lived . varying",
    "the effective coupling one can envision interesting possibilities to regulate quantum networks .    in what follows , we study super - radiance and its effect on transport properties in a quantum wire prototype : a one - dimensional chain of two level systems where the edges are coupled to the outside world presented by a continuum of channels .",
    "the two - channel wire has served as a model in @xcite where superconductivity in ladder structures was studied and in @xcite where a two - dimensional chain was coupled to an adatom .",
    "this specific system was not earlier analyzed from the viewpoint of super - radiance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "we consider the isolated wire , a closed chain of @xmath0 identical two - level cells with the nearest neighbor hopping interaction between the ground and excited states of neighboring cells .",
    "a closed form solution describes the two energy bands of the system .",
    "several symmetries associated with the eigenvectors of the system are explained as well .",
    "a brief description of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian is provided in section .",
    "the system is then opened through the coupling of the left and right edges of the chain to the continuum . as a result of",
    "the coupling the eigenenergies acquire an imaginary part .",
    "the evolution of the complex energies as a function of the coupling strength is studied in detail .",
    "it is shown that the width is uniformly distributed at weak coupling .",
    "however , the picture changes at strong couplings : the states are not uniformly broadened .",
    "the super - radiant states , their number being equal to the number of intrinsic doorway states directly coupled to the continuum , are greatly broadened while the remaining states acquire only small widths .",
    "the transport properties of the system are studied in section .",
    "it is shown that the transition between the weak and the strong coupling regimes , the so - called super - radiance transition , greatly influences the scattering properties of the system , particularly the transmission coefficient .",
    "energy - dependent coupling to the continuum due to the presence of the decay threshold is considered in section .",
    "it is shown that super - radiance plays a significant role , even when the energy levels are in proximity to their cutoff thresholds .",
    "the paper concludes in section .",
    "the wire of the model consists of a periodic chain of @xmath0 identical two - level cells .",
    "the energy levels of the ground state @xmath1 and the excited state @xmath2 of each cell are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",

    "however , the decoupled equations can be simplified with the realization of a symmetry resulting from the parallel ladder structure of the two - channel wire : @xmath15 rewriting eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) using eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) results in a second order difference equation : @xmath16 the solution to this equation , after applying the boundary condition @xmath17 , is a standing wave with the quasimomentum @xmath18 , @xmath19    one can find the energy levels of the system using eqs .",

    "as expected , the energy plot is similar to a typical semiconductor band structure ; the bands repel each other when the excitation amplitude @xmath5 grows .",
    "now we open the system coupling the excited states at the edges to the ideal leads which are characterized by a continuum of states . with the help of projector operators ,",
    "the continuum space could be eliminated . as a result ,",
    "one is left with an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian that acts only in the internal space of the closed system . a detailed derivation and discussion of the effective hamiltonian",
    "are provided in @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the open system can be presented as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hamiltonian of the isolated wire discussed in the previous section .",
    "the second item in the effective hamiltonian is an anti - hermitian term which introduces finite lifetimes to the intrinsic states of the open system .",

    "therefore the coupling amplitudes are in general energy - dependent and vanish below a certain threshold .",
    "this energy dependence becomes important for running energies close to the threshold , otherwise the amplitudes are smooth functions of the energy and energy dependency can be ignored .",
    "we assume that the left , @xmath36 , and the right , @xmath37 , edge state are each coupled to one channel in the continuum . correspondingly , the squares of the coupling amplitudes determine the partial widths @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the left and right edge states decoupled from the chain , @xmath40 in the basis of unperturbed chain states , the operator @xmath31 has only two matrix elements , @xmath41    in order to diagonalize the effective hamiltonian , @xmath31 is transformed into the eigenvector basis of the closed system , @xmath42 .",

    "the effective hamiltonian can now be diagonalized which leads to the following secular equation for the complex energies @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined as @xmath49 and @xmath50    fig .",
    "[ fig:003 ] shows the resonance complex energies @xmath51 of our system with @xmath0=5 , when the two ends are symmetrically coupled to the continuum , @xmath52 . at weak coupling ,",
    "when @xmath53=0.1 , all eigenenergies gain small decay width @xmath54 due to interaction with the environment .",
    "further increase of @xmath53 initially results in the increase of the decay widths for all resonances as illustrated in the upper right panel ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the complex pole dynamics changes at larger values of @xmath53 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at a critical point ,",
    "when @xmath561 , where @xmath57 is the mean level spacing of the energy levels of @xmath30 , the system undergoes a super - radiance transition .",
    "beyond this point the decay widths do not monotonically increase with the increase of @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , only some states ( super - radiant ) continue to increase their decay widths while the remaining states become long - lived ( trapped ) states . this phenomenon is illustrated in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:003 ] , where @xmath53=10 and the two super - radiant states , in accordance with the number of open channels , have obtained larger decay widths compared to the other states .",

    "the two overlapping super - radiant states are shown in the smaller window .",
    "note that the number of super - radiant states is always equal to the number of continuum channels coupled to the wire ; it is also important to notice the different vertical scales on these panels .",

    "( [ eqn16 ] ) . of course",
    ", one can also look at the reflection channels ; the reflectivity coefficient is @xmath67 , since the form of the anti - hermitian part ( [ eqn16 ] ) preserves the unitarity of the scattering matrix .    in order to study the effect of super - radiance on the transport properties of the wire ,",

    "in previous sections it was assumed that the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian do not depend on the running energy @xmath9 .",
    "the energy dependence appeared only due to the resonance denominators . here",
    "we briefly address a more realistic situation with energy - dependent coupling to the continuum .",
    "this dependence arises inevitably when the energy of an experiment is in the proximity of thresholds of the continuum channels ( separation energy in nuclei or the work function in solids ) . in transmission of electrons through a crystallic chain , the energy dependence can be regulated by the applied voltage . as a result ,",
    "the assumption of coupling amplitudes being constants or smooth function of energy is not valid and one should consider the energy dependency of the decay amplitudes .",

    "the four trapped states above threshold initially gain width as @xmath79 increases , however , beyond the super - radiant transition , when @xmath79=2 , they become long - lived states . on the lower right panel",

    "the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian was used to study an open quantum wire of two - level atoms .",
    "the dynamics of the states when the wire is coupled to the continuum undergo dramatic change as the strength of the coupling to the continuum varies crossing the super - radiant segregation point separating the broad ( short - lived ) states from long - lived ( trapped ) states .",
    "it was demonstrated that the width distribution of the states significantly alters transport properties of the wire .",
