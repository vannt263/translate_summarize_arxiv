    "over the last decades the field of dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) has seen important developments @xcite , both in fundamental aspects and prospective technological applications . as for the fundamental aspects , it was possible to understand the mechanisms of interaction between diluted magnetic impurities allowing ferromagnetic semiconductors at room temperature @xcite . from the point of view of prospective applications ,",
    "the marriage between the world of two - dimensional semiconductors and the world of magnetic data storage could provide us two - dimensional spintronics devices such as non - volatile magnetoresistive memories , spin valve , spin - based transistors and even magnetically enhanced optoelectronics devices @xcite .",
    "theoretical works based upon first - principles calculations have greatly contributed to the understanding of magnetism in dilute semiconductor materials @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been possible to achieve a spontaneous magnetic order above room temperature in a few classes of materials , including magnetic semiconducting oxides and nitrides @xcite . however , in practice disorder effects and thermal fluctuations result in curie temperatures well below the expectations .    in parallel , despite the success of two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials such as graphene @xcite , transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) @xcite and phosphorene , magnetism in 2d semiconductors has remained almost unexplored .",
    "one of the reasons for this might have been a theoretical result @xcite indicating that the curie temperature in 2d dms tends to be substantially lower than for the corresponding 3d system .",
    "however , a subsequent work dissipated doubts by showing that including an adequate description of the disorder and the temperature dependence of the fermi energy , it is possible to achieve much higher transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "concordantly , a monte carlo study of mn - doped mos@xmath1 , with first - principles parameters , has unraveled the potential of monolayer materials by predicting curie temperatures above room temperature @xcite .    from a technical point of view , 2d semiconductors have other winning factors that can be explored in magnetic or spintronic devices .",
    "firstly , the carrier concentration can be controlled externally by gating .",
    "and there is room for improving the control over the impurity concentration , for example exploring the possibility of using adatoms to incorporate impurities in concentrations above the solubility limit . in practice ,",
    "studies in magnetic semiconductor nanostructures with lower dimensionalities , including semiconductor nanocrystals and nanowires @xcite doped with transition metals ( tm ) , indicate that the confinement effect and improved control of magnetic dopants can be used to increase the curie temperature .",
    "phosphorene @xcite , a monolayer of black phosphorus , presents some advantages compared with other previously studied 2d semiconductors .",
    "different from semiconducting tmd , it is an elemental semiconductor and therefore less prone to vacancies @xcite .",
    "further , it has an anisotropic structure allowing in principle for different exchange interaction along the two principal directions . in host",
    "heteropolar semiconductors as gaas ( zincblende structure ) , there is antisite defects which reduces the curie temperatures of tm - doped gaas dilute magnetic semiconductors @xcite .",
    "it is expected that in 2d heteropolar semiconductors as tmd , antisite defects @xcite will also cause this effect . however , in elemental host semiconductors as phosphorene , this kind of defects does not exist .",
    "thus , curie temperatures of dilute magnetic semiconductors based on phosphorene are likely to be higher than those found in tm - doped tmd .        in this article",
    ", we use co as a prototype magnetic impurity to show that it possible to achieve magnetism ( ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism ) in phosphorene and that this can be switchable by the gate voltage through the control of the carrier density .",
    "we first studied the stability and electronic properties of co defects in phosphorene ( interstitial and substitutional ) , and thereafter , the magnetic orders acquired through the long - range interaction between diluted co defects .",
    "electronic , energetic and magnetic properties of the systems studied were calculated via first principles methods based upon density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed with the vasp code ( vienna ab initio simulation package ) @xcite with external potentials in paw approximation @xcite and exchange - correlation functional in perdew  burke ",
    "ernzerhof approximation ( gga - pbe ) @xcite and heyd  scuseria  ernzerhof approximation ( hse06 ) @xcite .",
    "we used cutoff energy of 400  ev for kohn ",
    "sham orbitals and first brillouin zone @xmath2-points sampling with @xmath3 grid calculated with monkhorst ",
    "pack algorithm @xcite for @xmath4 supercell . for density of states ( dos ) and projected density of states ( pdos ) ,",
    "we use brillouin zone integrations with @xmath2-points sampling in @xmath5 grid .",
    "the geometries were relaxed with residual force criteria of 10@xmath6  ev /  . the primitive unit cell for pristine phosphorene in our calculations was characterized by lattice constants @xmath7    and @xmath8   .",
    "we used vacuum distances of 15    to avoid spurious interactions . for the calculation of magnetic anisotropy energies ( mae ) , we used noncollinear spin polarization in fully - relativistic framework .",
    "volumetric data were analyzed with vesta program @xcite .",
    "ionisation levels were calculated using the marker method @xcite , taking the pristine supercell as reference .",
    "this method was found to give similar results to ionisation levels calculated using the formation energy method , after correcting for spurious electrostatic interactions , which partially cancel when systems with the same charge are compared @xcite .",
    "cobalt atoms can either be adsorbed on phosphorene or occupy a substitutional position ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . both of them lead to very small lattice distortion .",
    "substitutional cobalt ( @xmath9 ) forms three bonds , 35% shorter than the original p - p bonds [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ] . interstitial ( or adsorbed ) cobalt ( @xmath10 ) also forms three bonds , connecting p atoms in two zigzag ridges on the same side of the layer [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) ] .",
    "the adsorption energy of co@xmath11 defect is among the highest of tm adatoms on phosphorene @xcite .    in order to calculate the electronic properties of an isolated co point defect in phosphorene , were used a @xmath4 supercell , so that these co point defects are diluted in concentrations of 1.23% ( interstitial ) and 1.25% ( substitutional ) . unless otherwise stated , all the calculations described in this article are in these concentrations . whereas the co@xmath12-doped phosphorene does not presents nonzero magnetic moments",
    ", the co@xmath11-doped phosphorene presents a total magnetic moment of @xmath13 .",
    "this is 0.12  ev lower in energy than the nonmagnetic state ( nm ) .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) for the diluted co@xmath11 defect was obtained from fully - relativistic and noncollinear spin - polarised calculations .",
    "the vertical spin - polarization ( @xmath14-direction ) proved to be the lowest energy , whereas spin polarizations in other directions ( @xmath15 and @xmath16-direction ) are related by mae(@xmath17 ) = 1.0  mev , mae(@xmath18 ) = 0.8  mev , and mae(@xmath19 ) = 0.2  mev .",
    "since the magnetic anisotropy is small , we will treat the magnetic impurities using a collinear spin - polarised density - functional formalism .",
    "the band structures calculated for pristine , co@xmath12-doped and co@xmath11-doped phosphorene are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c)-(f ) . for the spin - degenerated co@xmath12-doped phosphorene band structure [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) ] , defect levels with dispersion of approximately 0.2  ev were introduced at about mid - gap , and the valence band shifts in such way that the valence band maximum ( vbm ) becomes located at @xmath20-point .",
    "this shifts in vbm will suppress the luminescence of phosphorene @xcite .",
    "as for the band structures ( spin up and down ) of co@xmath11-doped phosphorene , two localized levels are introduced in the spin down channel .",
    "one is occupied ( below the fermi level ) and other unoccupied ( above the fermi level ) . for the spin up channel , all co @xmath21-states are occupied , leading to an imbalance resulting in a local magnetic moment of 1  @xmath22 , which gives rise to a macroscopic magnetisation .",
    "the origin of the local magnetic moment in co@xmath11-doped phosphorene can be understood by analyzing the crystal field splitting , the hybridisation between the co valence states ( 4@xmath233@xmath24 ) and the phosphorene host states , which have mainly @xmath25 and @xmath0 character .    from the symmetry breaking point of view , while pristine phosphorene has @xmath26 point symmetry , cobalt point defects reduces the symmetry to @xmath27 .",
    "only a mirror plane , passing through the defect and perpendicular to phosphorene is preserved . in this lower symmetry ,",
    "cobalt @xmath21 orbitals transform as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 belong to the @xmath32 representation , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 belong to the @xmath35 representation @xcite .",
    "phosphorus @xmath0 orbitals splits in @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in @xmath32 representation , and @xmath39 is in @xmath35 representation .",
    "we observe that the @xmath40 hybridisation occurs in @xmath32 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 orbitals , and in @xmath35 with @xmath39 and @xmath33 .",
    "different from interstitial transition metals in other materials , the hybridisation is quite strong and therefore the electronic states can not be understood based only on a crystal field splitting model .",
    "this is apparent in the projected density of states ( pdos ) on cobalt atoms , obtained from the decomposition on atom - centred real spherical harmonics , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a)-(e ) .",
    "we noticed that there is @xmath40 hybridisation between @xmath0 orbitals from phosphorene and @xmath21 orbitals from cobalt defects , resulting in bonding and antibonding hybrid states .",
    "the exchange field splits each of these states , leading to a splitting into four peaks for each @xmath21 orbital .",
    "this effect is more pronounced on @xmath29 , @xmath33 and @xmath30 orbitals , which have maximum amplitude in the @xmath19 plane [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b),(c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath34 orbitals are nodal at the @xmath19 plane and therefore undergo smaller hybridisation and have lower energies . a schematic representation of crystal field and exchange splitting is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig2](f ) .",
    "for simplicity , this takes into account only the states with highest @xmath21 character for each @xmath21 orbital type and spin . whereas the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath29 and @xmath31 orbitals present exchange splitting in the range 0.320.45  ev , the @xmath30 orbital present exchange splitting of approximately 1.08  ev .",
    "this large apparent exchange splitting is in fact a combined effect of @xmath40 hybridisation and exchange field splitting , resulting in higher peak for spin up bonding state and spin down antibonding state .",

    "the number of phosphorus atoms missing ( @xmath47 ) is @xmath48 for co@xmath11 defects and @xmath49 for co@xmath12 defects .        in the neutral charge state ,",

    "however , both defects are electrically active and therefore the formation energy depends on the fermi level @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) . calculating the thermodynamic ionisation levels",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 with the marker method @xcite , we can evaluate the formation energies of charged point defects as a function of the fermi level as @xmath55(e_f ) = e^{f}[x^{0 } ] - i(+/0 ) + e_f,\\ ] ] for _ positive _ charged point defects ( @xmath56 ) , and @xmath57(e_f ) = \\delta_g^{pbe } + e^{f}[x^{0 } ] - i(0/- ) - e_f\\ ] ] for _ negative _ charged point defects ( @xmath58 ) , where the donor and acceptor levels are given relative to the valence and conduction band edges , respectively .",
    "the fermi level is set to zero at vbm . in equation , @xmath59 is the bandgap at pbe level .",
    "substitutional co is an acceptor with @xmath54 level at midgap ( at the pbe level ) and a double acceptor at @xmath60  ev , whereas @xmath61 is amphoteric .",
    "thus , in @xmath0-type material @xmath10 is stabilised , becoming more energetically favourable than @xmath9 .",
    "according to the pbe calculations , this happens for @xmath52 between @xmath62 and @xmath63  ev .",
    "however , since the bandgap is severely underestimated at the pbe level , we extrapolated the results using the valence and conduction band shifts obtained from hse calculations for the pristine phosphorene . here , we assume that the gap levels of @xmath10 and @xmath9 are very localised , are not shifted with respect to the vacuum level by the exchange component @xcite . by fixing the pbe and hse vacuum level at same energy",
    ", we observe the shifts @xmath64  ev in the valence band , and @xmath65  ev in the conduction band .",
    "the bandgap increase from @xmath66  ev at pbe level to @xmath67  ev at hse level . because of this large shift in the valence band at hse level",

    "the @xmath40 hybridisation in co@xmath11-doped phosphorene is characterized by long - range and anisotropic interactions between cobalt defects through the valence band , known as ruderman ",
    "kittel  kasuya",
    " yosida ( rkky ) interactions @xcite .",
    "these interactions have oscillating exchange coupling with the distance , leading to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders .    in order to determine the magnetic order of the fundamental state",
    ", we use a @xmath70 supercell with four co@xmath11 defects in equivalent positions . in these systems",
    ", the co@xmath11 defects are diluted in a concentration of 5.88  % . in neutral system ,",
    "the ferromagnetic ( fm ) order was more energetically favourable than antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order by @xmath71  mev .",
    "these magnetic orders are shown in fig .",

    "positive values of isosurfaces ( @xmath73 bohr@xmath6 ) are shown in blue , and negative values ( @xmath74 bohr@xmath6 ) are shown in red .",
    "since co@xmath11 defects are amphoteric , they can accept or donate electrons .",
    "codoping the system with electrons or holes , we can change the interaction between defects , and therefore , change the magnetic order of the system .",
    "we observe that when co@xmath11-doped phosphorene is @xmath75-type , @xmath76 decreases until a minimum value at 0.125@xmath77/co ( @xmath78 ) , and then increases to the ferromagnetic order is no longer stable at 1@xmath77/co . for the @xmath0-type co@xmath11-doped phosphorene ,",
    "the difference @xmath76 increases monotonically with the density of holes , so that there is a phase transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic at a critical density of holes ( @xmath79 ) .    for similar system , but with four co@xmath12 defects in phosphorene , due to acceptor character of co@xmath12 defects ,",
    "the magnetic orders were studied only codoping the system with electrons . in these systems ,",
    "the co@xmath12-doped phosphorene begins from nonmagnetic order at neutral state to a ferromagnetic order with @xmath80  mev at 1@xmath77/co ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "similar electric - field control of magnetism was observed in ( in , mn)as quantum well @xcite .",
    "in summary , we show that interstitial and substitutional cobalt defects in phosphorene are stable , with lowest formation energy for co@xmath11 defect in @xmath0-doped phosphorene , and co@xmath12 defect in neutral and @xmath75-doped phosphorene . also we show that through electron and hole codoping which can be controlled by gate potential , the exchange interaction between impurities can be engineered to yield ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders .",
    "this effect can be used in prospective spintronic applications . whereas tm - doped mos@xmath82 have shown diluted magnetism with very high curie temperatures ( above room temperature ) @xcite ,",
    "dilute magnetic phosphorene presents some advantages due to absence of antisite defects and less prone to vacancies , indicating potential higher curie temperatures and control of disordered impurities .",
