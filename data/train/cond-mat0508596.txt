    "complex networks are an essential part of modern society . many social , biological",
    ", transportation and communication systems can be cast into the form of complex networks , a set of nodes joined together by links indicating interactions .",
    "@xcite recently enormous interest has been devoted to the study of complex networks . among various existing models of complex networks , two different model topologies , the erds - rnyi model @xcite of the random graph ( rg ) and the barabsi - albert model @xcite of the scale - free network ( sf ) , have been widely studied .",
    "@xcite    the random graph is constructed starting from an initial condition of @xmath1 nodes and no edges . then edges are added between pairs of randomly selected nodes with connection probability @xmath4 .",
    "the number of edges connected to any particular node is called the degree @xmath5 of that node .",
    "the average degree of the random graph is @xmath6 .",
    "the scale - free network puts the emphasis on the network dynamics and is constructed with the algorithm of _ growth _ and _ preferential attachment_. according to the scale - free model , the network grows over time by the addition of new nodes and links .",
    "a node newly added to the network randomly selects @xmath7 other nodes to establish new links , with a selection probability that increases with the number of links of the selected node .",
    "one of the most relevant is given by power - law degree distribution @xmath8 , defined as the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree @xmath5 , @xmath9 .",
    "recently the security of complex networks to the random failures or intentional attacks has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "@xcite the random failure is simulated as the deletion of network nodes or links chosen at random , while intentional attack as the targeted removal of a specific class of nodes or links . in order to protect existing networks and design robust networks , we introduced the attack and repair strategy in ref . [ 16 ] , which will be described briefly in the following section . in this paper , we will study the correlations for random graphs and scale - free networks under the attack and repair strategy with the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite and investigate the intrinsic dynamics in both networks .",
    "the advantages of dfa over many methods are that it permits the detection of long - range correlations embedded in seemingly nonstationary time series , and also avoids the spurious detection of apparent long - range correlations that are an artifact of nonstationary .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the algorithm of the dfa method . in section iii",
    ", we apply the dfa method to investigate the correlations of the maximum degree @xmath0 and the average degree @xmath3 for random graphs and scale - free networks . in last section",
    "we present our brief conclusions .",
    "detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) is a well - established method for determining the scaling behavior of noisy data in the presence of trends without knowing their origin and shape .",
    "briefly , the dfa method involves the following steps .    1 .",
    "we consider a noisy time series @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath1 is the length of the series .",
    "we integrate the time series @xmath10 and subtract the mean @xmath12 , + @xmath13,\\ ] ] + where + @xmath14 2 .",
    "we divide the integrated signal @xmath15 into non - overlapping boxes of equal size @xmath16 ( scale of analysis ) .",
    "3 .   in each box of size @xmath16 , we fit the integrated time series @xmath15 by using a polynomial function , @xmath17 , which is called the local trend . for order-@xmath18 dfa ( dfa-1 if @xmath19 , dfa-2 if @xmath20 etc . )",
    ", @xmath18-order polynomial function is applied for the fitting .",
    "4 .   we detrend the integrated time series @xmath15 by subtracting the local trend @xmath17 in each box , and we calculate the detrended fluctuation function + @xmath21 5 .   for a given box size @xmath16 , we calculate the root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuation + @xmath22 ^ 2}\\ ] ] + and repeat the above computation for different box sizes @xmath16 ( different scales ) to provide a relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath16 .",
    "a power - law relation @xmath24 between @xmath23 and the box size @xmath16 indicates the presence of scaling .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 , called the scaling exponent or correlation exponent , represents the correlation properties of the signal . if @xmath26 , there is no correlation and the signal is an uncorrelated signal ( white noise )",
    "; if @xmath27 , the signal is anticorrelated ; if @xmath28 , there are positive correlations in the signal .",
    "first we will give a brief description about the attack and repair strategy .",
    "we start by constructing a network according to the algorithms of erds - rnyi random graph model ( rg ) or barabsi - albert scale - free model ( sf ) .",
    "the dynamics of the attack and repair strategy is defined in terms of the following two operations :    * _ attack _ : find a node with the maximum degree @xmath0 and remove all its links .",
    "( if several nodes happen to have the same highest degree of connection , we randomly choose one of them . ) * _ repair _ : reconnect this node with the other nodes in the network with repair probability @xmath2 .",
    "then , the evolution comes into the next monte carlo time step . at each monte carlo time step @xmath29",
    ", we record the maximum degree @xmath30 and the average degree @xmath31 of the system .",
    "the reason we choose @xmath0 and @xmath3 to analyze is that they represent the local and statistical features of the system .",
    "since the time step should be large enough to enable the system to reach stationary state , it is chosen to be 1.5 million in our simulation . to reduce the effect of fluctuation on calculated results , for every system with size @xmath1",
    ", the calculated results @xmath0 and @xmath3 are averaged over 10 independent runs for each network realization .      according to the attack and repair strategy",
    ", it can be easily seen that the network has a tendency to decrease the maximum number of connections among the nodes at a long time scale , because the nodes with highest connections will be damaged and reconnected randomly .     for ( a ) random graph and ( b ) scale - free network under @xmath32 and @xmath33.,width=302,height=302 ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we plot the maximum degree @xmath0 versus time step @xmath29 for rg and sf with @xmath32 nodes and repair probability @xmath33 .",
    "it should be illustrated here that , in order to reduce the number of parameters in the model , we set the repair probability @xmath2 the same as the connection probability @xmath4 in rg .",
    "1 shows that @xmath0 of rg decreases slowly and fluctuates widely , while @xmath0 of sf decreases very steeply at the beginning and then very slowly with small fluctuations .",
    "the different behaviors of @xmath0 for rg and sf are rooted in their different topological structures .",
    "rg has homogeneous poissonian degree distribution : all nodes have approximately the same number of links .",
    "the removal of each node causes the same amount of damage .",
    "sf is an extremely inhomogeneous network : because the power - law distribution implies that the minority of nodes have highly connected nodes .",
    "the removal of these nodes drastically decreases the degrees of the network .     as a function of the scale @xmath16 , for series @xmath0 of random graphs ( rg ) and scale - free networks ( sf ) under @xmath32 and @xmath34 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , respectively .",
    "the dashed line represents the fit of the slope.,width=302,height=302 ]    in fig.2 we present results from the dfa-3 analysis for the maximum degree @xmath0 of rg and sf .",
    "the system size is @xmath32 nodes and the repair probability @xmath2 are 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , respectively . in this double logarithm graph ,",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuation function @xmath23 as a function of the scale @xmath16 , exhibit two distinct scaling regimes with the crossover at about @xmath35 ,    @xmath36    for @xmath37 , the scaling exponent @xmath38 is about 0.51 ; while for @xmath39 , the exponent @xmath40 is about 0.05 .",
    "our dfa results suggest that the fluctuation is quite random ( close to white noise ) for short time scales .",
    "as the time scale becomes larger , the fluctuation displays strong anticorrelation , that is , a large value ( compared to the average ) of @xmath0 is almost always followed by a small value . with the increase of the repair probability @xmath2 , we find that there is a vertical shift of the rms fluctuation function @xmath23 to larger values and the shift between @xmath33 and 0.02 is very big .",
    "in addition , the similar shape between @xmath23 and @xmath16 is observed for both rg and sf under different @xmath2 , which illustrates that the time series of @xmath0 for rg and sf have the similar correlation properties .       for ( a ) random graph and ( b ) scale - free network under @xmath32 and @xmath33.,width=302,height=302 ]    the average degree @xmath3 is a statistical topological property of complex networks .",
    "the time series of @xmath3 reflect the general changes of rg and sf under the evolution of attack and repair .",
    "we find that @xmath41 of both rg and sf decay exponentially with small fluctuations as shown in fig .",
    "3 , under the system size @xmath32 and the repair probability @xmath33 .",
    "the inset panel of fig .",
    "3 gives the series of @xmath3 in linear coordinates , showing that @xmath3 decreases very steeply at first and then becomes steadily .",
    "in fact , the curve of @xmath41 , to a large degree , depends on the repair probability @xmath2 .",
    "the bigger the repair probability , the smoother the curve will be . here",
    "we choose @xmath33 to analyze , considering to have a comparison with the results of @xmath0 .",
    "we next investigate the correlation properties of series @xmath42 .",
    "4(a ) shows the results of applying dfa-3 to the series @xmath3 of rg under @xmath32 and @xmath340.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , respectively . in the log - log coordinates , the rms fluctuation function @xmath23 and",
    "the scale @xmath16 has a power - law dependence with scaling exponent @xmath43 , which indicates the presence of the positive correlations and the weak long - range ( long - memory ) power - law correlations .",
    "the results suggest that a value of @xmath3 at a given time depends on values of long past in a power - law fashion .",
    "we also note that @xmath23 shifts downwards slightly with the increase of @xmath2 , which is oppositive to that of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "2 . besides , the big shift between @xmath33 and 0.02 vanishes here .",
    "4(b ) reports the dfa-3 results of time series @xmath41 for sf under @xmath32 and @xmath340.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , correspondingly .",
    "the two - segment power - law relationship is observed with the crossover at about @xmath44 ,    @xmath45    for short time scales ( @xmath46 ) , the rms fluctuation function @xmath23 has the similar scaling exponent with @xmath47 for different repair probability @xmath2 . for longer time scales ( @xmath48 ) , the exponents @xmath40 of @xmath33 , 0.02 , 0.03 correspond to 0.54 , 0.36 , 0.23 .",
    "it shows that the rms fluctuation function @xmath23 decreases and the series @xmath3 becomes strong anticorrelated with increasing @xmath2 for longer time scales .     as a function of the scale @xmath16 , for series @xmath3 of ( a ) random graphs ( rg ) and ( b ) scale - free networks ( sf ) , under @xmath32 and @xmath34 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , respectively",
    "the dashed line for rg and the solid line for sf represent the fit of the slopes.,width=302,height=302 ]    fig .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) demonstrate that the rms fluctuation function @xmath23 of series @xmath3 exhibits different scaling behaviors for rg and sf .",
    "the positive long - lange power - law correlations of rg are probably due to the strong restriction , defined as the connection probability equals the repair probability , @xmath49 . for scale - free networks ,",
    "the repair probability @xmath2 has a great effect on the power - law degree distribution of sf in small ranges .",
    "the randomness are dominated at small time scales , characterized by uncorrelated series . while at large time scales , the power - law degree distributions are dominated , characterized by the anticorrelation .    further , fig . 2 and fig .",
    "4 represent the dfa results of series @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "we note that , with the increase of @xmath2 , the rms fluctuation function @xmath23 increases in @xmath0 but decreases in @xmath3 .",
    "it is the consequence that more random connections are added with increasing @xmath2 . according to the local property of @xmath0 , the fluctuation of the system increases with added randomness . while according to the statistical property of @xmath3 , the fluctuation of the system decreases since the added connections balanced the degrees of the whole network",
    "in summary , we use dfa method to analyze the correlation properties of random graphs and scale - free networks under the attack and repair strategy . according to the analysis of the maximum degree @xmath0 representing the local property of the system , we find that both random graphs and scale - free networks exhibit the similar scaling behaviors , which suggest that the fluctuations are quite random at short time scales but strong anticorrelated at longer time scales . with the analysis of the average degree @xmath3 representing the statistical property of the system , we observe that random graphs and scale - free networks display completely different scaling behaviors .",
    "random graphs show long - range power - law correlations ; while scale - free networks are uncorrelated at short time scales but display anticorrelations at longer time scales . with the increase of the repair probability @xmath2 , the apparent vertical shifts of the rms fluctuation function @xmath23 for @xmath0 and @xmath3 are due to the effects of the increase of random connections to the networks .",
