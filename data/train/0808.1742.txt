    "however as we hope is clear from the discussion in section [ scalingargument ] below , the construction allows any choice of @xmath51 . ] and its proof involves a strong interplay between the equation s dispersion and nonlinearity .",

    "bourgain has also shown @xcite , @xcite that there is an abundance of time quasi - periodic solutions of .    as mentioned at the outset ,",
    "the growth of higher sobolev norms is just one way to quantify the diffusion of energy to higher and higher modes - also called a forward cascade , or a direct cascade .",
    "furthur motivation for theorem [ main ] , and indeed for much of the work cited above , is the literature of analysis , physics , numerics , heuristics and conjectures regarding this phenomenon in related wave models .",
    "for example , since the early 1960 s a so - called _ weak turbulence theory _",
    "( alternatively _ wave turbulence theory _ ) has been developed which gives a statistical description of the forward cascade in various `` weakly interacting '' dispersive wave models , mainly based on the analysis of associated kinetic equations for the evolution of the fourier modes .",
    "there are a great many subsequent works both within and outside the framework of weak turbulence theory which address the passage of energy to higher modes in dispersive wave models .",
    "we are not prepared to give here a representative survey , but see @xcite and references therein for examples .    in broadest outline ,",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] proceeds by first viewing as an infinite dimensional system of o.d.e.s in @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is closely related to the fourier mode @xmath57 of the solution . we identify a related system , which we call the _ resonant system _ , that we use as an approximation to the full system . the goal",
    "then will be to build a solution @xmath58 to the resonant system which grows in time .",
    "this is accomplished by choosing the initial data @xmath59 to be supported on a certain frequency set @xmath60 in such a way that the resonant system of o.d.e.s collapses to an even simpler , finite dimensional system that we call _ the toy model system _ , and whose solution we denote by @xmath61 .",

    "first , we show the existence of the frequency set @xmath63 , which is defined in terms of the desired sobolev norm growth and according to a wish - list of geometric and combinatorial properties aimed at simplifying the resonant system .",
    "second , we show that the toy model system exhibits unstable orbits that travel from an arbitrarily small neighborhood of one invariant manifold to near a distant invariant manifold .",
    "it is this instability which is ultimately responsible for the support of the solution s energy moving to higher frequencies .",
    "instabilities like this have been remarked on at least as far back as @xcite , but have been studied with increasing interest since the paper of arnold @xcite .",
    "our construction has similarities with previous work on so - called `` arnold diffusion '' and more general instabilities in hamiltonian systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the particular approach taken here seems to be different than arguments presently in the literature and might be of independent interest .",
    "there are several different definitions of `` arnold diffusion '' ( see e.g. the remarks in the introduction of the survey by delshams , gidea , and de la llave in @xcite ) .",
    "our use of this term for the orbits described above , which travel close to a sequence of invariant manifolds and lead to a change in the action variable of order 1 , is in line with some , but not all of these conventions .",
    "we emphasize also that `` diffusion '' is used here as in much of the literature , in a nontechnical - even colloquial - sense following @xcite .",

    "( we will soon choose the constant @xmath68 to achieve a cancellation . )",
    "we make the _ fourier ansatz _ , motivated by the explicit solution of the linear problem associated to @xmath65 . for solutions of the @xmath69 equation ,",
    "we write @xmath70 we consider in this paper only smooth solutions , so the series on the right of is absolutely summable . substituting into the equation and equating fourier coefficients for both sides gives the following infinite system of equations for @xmath56 , @xmath71 where @xmath72 certain terms on the right hand side of can be removed by correctly choosing the gauge parameter @xmath68 .",
    "we describe this cancellation this now .",

    ", we also get the same claim for any @xmath780 since any such @xmath185 is comparable up to a factor of two to an integer multiple of @xmath185 .",
    "thus we only need to exhibit an example for a single @xmath781 .",
    "but then the magnitude hypothesis would follow from the weaker hypothesis    * ( non - zero ) @xmath782 for all @xmath393 .",
    "and we can now drop the magnitude hypothesis .",
    "next , we can weaken the integrality hypothesis @xmath783 $ ] to a rationality hypothesis @xmath784 $ ] , since by dilating @xmath778 ( and hence @xmath739 ) by a suitable large integer ( the least common denominator of all the coefficients of @xmath785 ) .    now observe that in order for @xmath785 to lie in the complex rationals @xmath786 $ ] , it would suffice ( by an easy induction argument ) for the initial placement function @xmath778 to take values in @xmath786 $ ] , and for all the phases @xmath747 to be _",
    "pythagorean _ , i.e. @xmath787 $ ] .",
    "( a typical example of a pythagorean phase is @xmath788 ) .",
    "so we may replace the rationality hypothesis by the hypothesis that the initial placement function is complex - rational and all the phases are pythagorean .    however , the complex rationals @xmath786 $ ] are dense in @xmath746 , and the pythagorean phases are dense in @xmath789 ( indeed they form an infinite subgroup of this unit circle )",
    ". thus by a perturbation argument we may dispense with these conditions altogether .",
    "note that the remaining conditions required are all open conditions , in that they are stable under sufficiently small perturbations of the parameters .",
    "thus any non - rational solution to the above problem can be perturbed into a rational one .",
    "we have now eliminated the integrality and magnitude hypotheses .",
    "we now work on eliminating the non - zero , injectivity , and closure / faithfulness hypotheses .",
    "the point is that in the parameter space ( the space of initial placement functions @xmath778 and phases @xmath747 ) , the set of solutions to the norm explosion property is certainly an open set , so it is either empty or has positive measure .",
    "so it suffices to show that the sets where each of the non - zero , injectivity , and closure / faithfulness fail is a measure zero set , and thus they have no impact as to whether a solution actually exists or not .",
    "let s begin with the injectivity condition .",
    "we need to show that for each distinct @xmath790 , that we have @xmath791 for almost every choice of parameters @xmath778 , @xmath305 . without loss of generality",
    "we may take @xmath718 and @xmath792 where @xmath793 .",

    "now suppose @xmath797 .",
    "since @xmath718 , there is a unique combinatorial family @xmath798 where @xmath799 are the parents of @xmath10 and @xmath800 is the sibling of @xmath10 . by induction hypothesis",
    ", we have @xmath801 for almost every choice of parameters .",
    "now note that @xmath802 lies on the circle with diameter @xmath803 , @xmath804 , with the location on this circle determined by the angle @xmath747 .",
    "this angle @xmath747 is a free parameter and will not influence the value of @xmath805 , unless @xmath398 is equal to the sibling @xmath800 of @xmath10 .",
    "but in the latter case @xmath806 will be diametrically opposite to @xmath802 and thus unequal to @xmath802 ( since @xmath801 ) . in all other cases",
    "we see that for almost every choice of @xmath747 , @xmath802 will not be equal to @xmath805 , simply because a randomly chosen point on a circle will almost surely be unequal to any fixed point .",
    "this establishes injectivity almost everywhere .",
    "a similar argument establishes the non - zero property almost everywhere : if @xmath10 is in the first generation @xmath735 then it is clear that @xmath807 for almost every @xmath778 , and for @xmath10 in any later generation , @xmath802 again ranges freely on the circle generated by its two parents @xmath803 , @xmath804 ( which are distinct for almost every choice of parameters ) , determined by some angle parameter @xmath747 and thus will be non - zero for almost all choices of @xmath747 .",

    ", we next claim that the circle @xmath375 contains no elements of @xmath819 other than @xmath820 .",
    "to see this for the first @xmath821 generations @xmath822 follows from the induction hypothesis , because if @xmath375 contained a point @xmath823 from one of those generations then @xmath803 , @xmath804 , @xmath823 would be a right - angled triangle , contradicting the induction hypothesis for almost all choices of parameters .",
    "to see the claim for the last generation @xmath824 , we note that any point @xmath825 from that generation ranges on another circle @xmath826 spanned by the parents @xmath827 of @xmath66 ; since @xmath828 and @xmath829 do not lie on @xmath375 we know that @xmath826 is not co - incident to @xmath375 , and so for almost all choices of the angle parameter determining @xmath825 from @xmath828 and @xmath829 we know that @xmath825 does not lie on @xmath375 .",
    "to summarize , we know that @xmath802 varies freely on the circle @xmath375 as determined by the angle @xmath747 , that @xmath818 is diametrically opposite to @xmath802 , that @xmath803 , @xmath804 are also diametrically opposite points on @xmath375 , and all other points in @xmath819 lie outside of @xmath375 and are not affected by @xmath747 ( for almost all choices of parameters ) . since @xmath830 by hypothesis , this shows that for almost all choices of @xmath747 , @xmath802 , @xmath805 , @xmath811 do not form a right - angled triangle .    from the preceding discussion",
