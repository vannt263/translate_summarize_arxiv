    "in quantum measurement process , wave packet collapse ( wpc , also called von neumann s projection or wave function reduction ) physically resembles the disappearance of interference pattern for young s two - slit experiment in the presence of a `` which - way '' detector .",
    "associated with the wave - particle duality , this phenomenon of losing quantum coherence is referred to as the so - called quantum decoherence .",
    "in fact , before a measurement to observe `` which - way '' the particle actually takes , the quantum particle seems to move from a point to another along several different ways simultaneously .",
    "this just reflects the wave feature of a quantum particle .",
    "the detection of `` which - way '' means a probe for the particle feature , which leads to the disappearance of wave feature or quantum decoherence[2 ] .",
    "further explanation for decoherence phenomena was made in the view point of complementarity by niels bohr based on heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty [ 3 ] : a particular interaction between a classical instrument ( detector ) and the measured quantum system can be regarded as a quantum measurement ; but once enough data about the states of the quantum system is `` read out '' from the motion configuration of the detector , the interaction unavoidably destroys the interference pattern .",
    "according to heisenberg s uncertainty principle , to locate the position of a particle to the uncertainty of order @xmath0 along the direction orthogonal to its moving direction , the `` which - way '' measurement must kick the momentum of the particle to an uncertainty of order @xmath1 and thereby washes out the spatial interference pattern .",
    "( in this paper the plank constant is taken to be unity ) .",
    "bohr s argument sounds correct , but a recent experiment [ 4 ] on brrag s reflection of cold atoms shows that schrodinger s concept of entangled state , rather than the unavoidable measurement distribution , is crucial for the wave - particle duality in this `` which - way '' experiment .",
    "another `` which - way '' experiment [ 5 ] , which uses the electron aharonov - bohm interference with a quantum point contact , also manifests the importance of quantum entanglement . actually , similar _ gedenken _ experiments using photon and neutron have been considered before [ 6 - 7 ]    a quantum entangled state [ 8 - 10 ] such as @xmath2 for any @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a coherent superposition of states of a quantum system of many particles or of a single particle with many degrees of freedom .",
    "it involves a correlation between the states @xmath5 of the quantum system and the states @xmath6 of the detector .",
    "once the detector is found in a state @xmath7 the total system must collapse into a certain component @xmath8 .",
    "then one can infer the state @xmath9 of the quantum system .",
    "the interference pattern can be obtained from the total wave function @xmath10 by  summing over \" all possible states of the detector .",
    "assuming the states of the detector are normalized , we have @xmath11 is the state of the quantum system in position representation . the second term on the r.h.s of the above equation is responsible for the interference pattern .",
    "it is easy to see the interference fringes completely vanish when the states of the detector are orthogonal to one another [ 10 ] , i.e. , when @xmath12 .",
    "in this situation , an ideal quantum measurement results from the ideal entanglement with the orthogonal correlated components @xmath6 , in which one can distinguish the state of detector very well .",
    "mathematically , by using the reduced density matrix @xmath13 which is obtained by tracing out the variables of detector , the above - mentioned decoherence phenomenon can be equivalently expressed as a projection or reduction of the reduced density matrix from a pure state @xmath14 to a mixed state @xmath15    it is noticed that , so long as the `` which - way '' information already stored in the detector _ could be read out _ , the interference pattern has been destroyed _ without any data read out in practice _ [ 4,5 ] . in this sense",
    "the environment surrounding the quantum system behaves as a detector to realize a `` measurement - like '' process .",
    "this is because the environment _ never needs to read out _ the data .",
    "thus , the above argument is also applicable to the analysis of decoherence problem of an interfering quantum system coupling to the environment [ 8 - 10].in this kind of problems , the environment is imagined as an objective detector detecting the states of the quantum system and thereby the detector states @xmath6 are thought to be the macroscopic quantum states of the environment .",
    "provide the environment couples with the quantum system and produce an ideal entanglement , the quantum system must lose its coherence .",
    "it is worthy to point out that this simple entanglement conserves the energy of the quantum system while destroying the quantum coherence .",
    "the loss of energy of the quantum system can be separately discussed in the quantum dissipation theory well developed in recent years [ 11 - 16 ]    in our previous works on quantum measurement theory[17 - 23 ] , we investigate how an ideal entanglement appears in the macroscopic limit that the number @xmath16 of particles making up the detectors approaches infinity .",
    "it was found that the _ _  factorization structure _ _",
    "@xmath17}|d_n^{[j]}\\rangle \\eqno{(1.4)}\\ ] ] concerning the overlapping of detector - states plays a crucial part in quantum decoherence . here ,",
    "@xmath18}\\rangle $ ] are the single states of those blocks constituting the detector , and @xmath19 is called decoherence factor . since each factor",
    "@xmath20}|d_n^{[j]}\\rangle $ ] in @xmath19 has a norm less than unity , the product of infinite such factors may approach zero .",
    "this investigation was developed based on the hepp - coleman mode and its generalizations[24 - 27 ] . in 1998 , this theory was applied to the analysis of the universality [ 28 ] of the environment influences on quantum computing process [ 29 - 31].parallelly , the classical limit that certain quantum numbers ( such as angular momentum ) are huge is also investigated in our previous works .",
    "however we have not got a totally - satisfactory answer to the question why the large system entangling with the small system behaves so classically in such limit situations .",
    "in fact , concerning the transition of the detector from quantum status to classical status , there were only some vague presentations[17 , 19 , 21 , ] . in a general situation",
    "the classical feature of the large system can not simply be characterized by large quantum numbers , and thus what is responsible for the classical feature remains unclear yet .",
    "besides , all of our previous discussions about quantum decoherence are based on interaction of particular forms , namely the non - demolition interaction [ 3 ] . in this paper , using born - oppenheimer ( b - o ) approximation [ 32 ] , we universally consider the decoherence problem for a quantum system coupling to a large system through a general interaction .",
    "this basic approach can be applied to analyzing influences exerted by environment and detector as well .",
    "our discussion is also involved with a fundamental problem that the physicist can not avoid completely : how does the time reversal symmetry implied by the schrodinger equation on the microscopic scale turn into the time reversal asymmetry manifested by quantum decoherence or quantum dissipation on the macroscopic scale ?    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe in sec.2 the adiabatic factorization of slow and fast dynamic variables in terms of the b - o approximation and show how the interaction of the large object with a quantum system causes a quantum entanglement dynamically . in sec.3,incorporating the semi - classical approach to the quasi - classical motion of slow variable in a smooth potential",
    ", we manifest that , driven by the adiabatically - effective hamiltonians , the final states of the large object initially in an appropriate state are orthogonal to one another , and their entanglement with the quantum system leads to decoherence . in sec.4 , sec.5 and sec.6 , the universal formalism in secs.2 and 3 is illustrated by three explicit examples : _",
    "a_. a particle with spin @xmath21 moves slowly in an inhomogeneous magnetic field of varying direction ; _ b_.",
    "a two level quantum system interacting with a very large spin ; _ c_. a quantized cavity field is coupled with a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "the first illustration is similar to the stern - gerlach experiment [ 33 ] .",
    "it stresses that the classical properties of the large system can be understood in terms of the macroscopic distinguishability of its quantum states .",
    "the second illustration reflects a simple presentation of quantum- classical transition when the quantum number is huge [ 34 ] .",
    "the third illustration has certain practical significance as it is relevant to the problem of detecting gravitational wave by intracavity dynamics [ 35,36 ] .",
    "it demonstrates the necessity of choosing a quasi - classical initial state of the large system to realize the quantum coherence of the quantum system . in sec.7 ,",
    "based on the adiabatic approach for quantum decoherence , we discuss the spatial localization of the macroscopic object resulting from the adiabatic entanglement between its collective coordinate and the dynamic variables of particles constituting it .",
    "this study provides us with a possible solution to the schroedinger cat paradox.concluding remarks are given in the end.it includes a brief discussion about the development of quantum dynamic theory of decoherence .",
    "in connection with the coupled channel theory , one of whose concrete realization is the b - o approach , our discussion reveals the possibility of generalizing our present work to the case with a complicated and hence more practical interaction than the over - simplified interaction as shown in the two examples presented in sec . 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "in a very wide sense , any interaction between two quantum systems can cause an entanglement between them . in general , it then realizes a quantum measurement in a certain meaning .",
    "this is because one quantum system in different states can act on another with different effects correspondingly .",
    "however , this entanglement and its relevant quantum measurement is generally not very ideal because the usual interaction can not produce a one - one correspondence between the states of the two systems .",
    "indeed , only a very particular interaction or its effective reduction can lead to an ideal entanglement and thereby an ideal quantum measurement .",
    "nevertheless , fortunately , so long as one of the two systems can be separated _ adiabatically _ and behaves _",
    "classically_,as we will prove in the following , any interaction can result in an ideal entanglement in the evolution of the total system through its adiabatic reduction based on born - oppenheimer ( b - o ) approximation .",
    "from the view point of bo approximation , we consider a total quantum system ( `` molecular '' ) with two sets of variables , a fast ( `` electric '' ) one @xmath22 and a slow ( nuclear ) one @xmath23 . resolving the dynamics of fast variables for a given motion of the slow subsystem ,",
    "we obtain certain quantum states labeled by @xmath24 for the fast part . to the first order approximation ,",
    "the left effective hamiltonian governing the slow variables involves an external scalar potential @xmath25 and an magnetic - like vector potential @xmath26 induced by the fast variables [ 37,38 ] .",
    "the latter is called the induced gauge potential or berry s connection .",
    "if we assume the motions of the slow subsystem are `` classical '' , we naturally observes that , due to the back - actions of the fast part , there are different induced forces @xmath27 exerting on the slow part .",
    "their direct physical effects are that the information of the `` fast '' states labeled by @xmath24 is recorded in the different motion configurations of the slow part .",
    "an entanglement just stems from this correlation between the quantum states of the fast subsystem and the classical motion configurations of the slow subsystem . in spirit of this physically - intuitive observation ,",
    "we study the production of such quantum entanglement from the adiabatic separation of slow and fast variables based on the b - o approach .",
    "let us consider the interaction between a quantum system @xmath28 with fast dynamic variable @xmath22 and the large system @xmath29 with slow variable @xmath30 the former with the hamiltonian @xmath31 can be regarded as a subsystem soaked in an environment or a measured system monitored by a detector , and the latter with the hamiltonian @xmath32 as the environment or the detector accordingly . in general",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is written as @xmath33 . for a fixed value of slow variable @xmath23 of @xmath29 ,",
    "the dynamics of the quantum system is determined by the eigen - equation @xmath34|n[x]\\rangle = v_n(x)|n[x]\\rangle \\eqno{(2.2)}\\ ] ] both the eigen - values @xmath35 $ ] and the eigen - state @xmath36\\rangle $ ] depend on the slow variable @xmath23 as a given parameter .",
    "usually , the variation of the hamiltonian @xmath37 with @xmath23 can cuase transition from an energy level @xmath25 of the quantum system to another level @xmath38 .",
    "but within the spatial domain @xmath39 to which the slow variable @xmath23 belongs , if the variable @xmath23 changes so slowly that the adiabatic conditions [ 39 - 42 ] @xmath40|\\partial",

    "let @xmath41 be the full eigen- function of the full hamiltonian @xmath42 for the total system formed by the large system plus the quantum system .",

    "then it evolves to a superposition of different final states @xmath73 .",
    "this intuitive argument shows us that , there indeed exists an entanglement between two quantum systems with an quite general interaction , if one of them moves so slowly that their dynamic variables can be adiabatically factorised according to the b - o approximation .",
    "roughly speaking , in the b - o approach , the slow subsystem is usually referred to as heavy particles ( such as nucleons ) while the fast one as light particles ( such as the electrons ) .",
    "so it is reasonable to expect the slow subsystem to behave as a classical object .",
    "in this section we will discuss under what conditions the large system , the environment or the detector , can behave classically so that the quantum system entangled with it could completely lose its coherence and approach the classical limit .    consider the reduced density matrix of the quantum system @xmath74\\rangle \\langle n[x]|+\\cr & & + \\sum_{n\\neq m}c_mc_n^{*}|m[x]\\rangle \\langle n[x]|\\langle d_n(t)|d_m(t)\\rangle \\ ] ]    obtained by  summing over  the variables of the large system .",

    "here @xmath77 is a free evolution state of the large system .",
    "mathematically , the effect of the adiabatic effective interaction is to multiply the off - diagonal term of the reduced density matrix by the decoherence factor @xmath78 a complete decoherence is defined by @xmath79 while a complete coherence by @xmath80    before considering how the decoherence factor @xmath81 becomes zero for the large system , we need to review some known arguments about the meaning of the classical limit of the motion of the large system . according to a widely accepted viewpoint [ 44 ] , in the classical limit",
    ", the expectation value of an observable for certain particular states should recover its classical value forms",
    ". these particular states can give definite classical trajectories of particle in this limit .",
    "usually we call them quasi - classical states",
    ". a coherent state or its squeezed version is a typical example of such states . according to landau and lifshitz [ 44 ] , in general , a quasi - classical state is a particular superposition @xmath82 with the non - zero coefficients @xmath83 only distributing around a large quantum number @xmath84 .",
    "then the correspondence principle requires that @xmath85 and the product @xmath86 approaches a finite classical action .",
    "in such a limit , the expectation of an observable will take the fourier series of its corresponding classical quantity ; or strictly speaking , it takes the fej@xmath87r s arithmetic mean of the partial sums of the fourier series [ 45 ] . in this sense",
    "the mean - square deviation of the observable is zero ; and accordingly the mean of the position operator defines a classical path .",
    "physically , the zero mean - square deviation of the position operator implies the zero width of each wave packet @xmath88and the overlapping @xmath89 of zero width wave packets must vanish .",
    "from such a semi - classical picture , we will clearly see in the following how the decoherence factor @xmath81 approaches zero dynamically as the large system becomes classical .    in the semi - classical approach , for a heavy particle",
    ", the initial state @xmath90 can be regarded as a very narrow wave packet of width @xmath91 .",
    "since the heavy particle has a large mass @xmath92 it hardly spreads in the evolution because without the environment induced quantum dissipation [ 15,16 ] the width of the wave packet at time @xmath65 is @xmath93 then we describe the large system as an moving wave packet with the center along a classical path @xmath94 on a manifold with local coordinates @xmath30 for a proper initial state @xmath95we will see that the wave packet will split into several narrow peaks with the centers along different paths determined by different motion equations governed by the effective forces @xmath96 with effective potentials @xmath97 usually , the widths of these peaks are almost of the same order as that of the original wave packet and each peak is correlated to an adiabatic quantum state @xmath36\\rangle $ ] for a large mass . except for some moments at which the centers of two or more peaks coincide , these narrow peaks hardly overlaps with one another . in this sense ,",
    "the large system starting from a narrow initial state can reach a superposition of those states orthogonal to one another .",
    "thus we approximately have @xmath98 in the classical limit for @xmath99    with reference to the useful analysis in ref.[10 ] , we present an explicit but sketchy calculation to justify the above physically - intuitive observation about @xmath98 in the classical limit .",
    "assume the large system to be a heavy particle with very large mass @xmath100 .",
    "in the duration @xmath101 of the adiabatic interaction with the quantum system , if the condition @xmath102 @xmath103 holds , the momentum @xmath104 of the free heavy particle can not be changed notably .",
    "thus the contributions of the kinetic term and the induced gauge potential can be ignored in the wave function evolution of the free heavy particle under this condition . from this consideration",
    "we can approximately write down @xmath105 the approximation requires that the effective potential @xmath25 is satisfactorily smooth or the interaction @xmath106 is a smooth function of @xmath30 so we can use @xmath107 to re - express the decoherence factor @xmath108 here , @xmath109 is the difference of two external forces exerted by two adiabatic potentials @xmath38 and @xmath110 then the role of the back - action of the quantum system on the large system is summing up the momentum shift by a quantity @xmath111 with respect to the initial state @xmath90 .",
    "obviously , when the width @xmath112 of the initial wave packet @xmath113 in the momentum space is much less than the momentum shift @xmath111 , the large system will adiabatically evolves into states orthogonal to one another .",
    "in fact , if the initial state is chosen to be a guassian wave packet @xmath114 $ ] of width @xmath115 the decoherence factor is a guassian decaying function of time @xmath65@xmath116 as the evolution time @xmath65 approaches infinity or if we have a very narrow width @xmath117 , @xmath118 and a quantum decoherence results from the dynamical evolution automatically .    generally , we consider a system described by @xmath119 without the induced gauge field .",
    "define @xmath120 and @xmath121 for an initial state @xmath122 . in the classical regime",
    "one may expect that the variations @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125 are small compared with @xmath126 and @xmath127accordingly the potential can be expanded as @xmath128 so , approximately the heisenberg equations of motion become @xmath129 sandwiched by the initial state @xmath130 , the above equations turn into the classical equations of motion @xmath131 now we turn to schrdinger s picture .",

    "then straightforward calculation gives @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "this exactly describes an oscillator with time - dependent frequency .",
    "the above direct derivation shows that in the non - inertial frame moving along the classical orbit , every quasi - classical system looks like a time - dependent oscillator whose frequency depends on the orbit .",
    "this fact is an established conclusion and illustrated in fig 1 . actually , it is present in many textbooks about path integral .",
    "but our argument here is based on a clear physical picture and is applicable to the three dimensional case after a slight generalization .",
    "denote by @xmath138 the vacuum state of the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath139 which is equivalent to a gaussian wave packet of width @xmath140.suppose that initially the system is in the state @xmath141 , a coherent state whose center lies at @xmath142 . at time @xmath65,the center of the wave packet is obviously at @xmath143 , and it is reasonable to expect that the width of the wave packet becomes @xmath144,since the frequency of the time - dependent oscillator changes very slowly .",
    "for two different potentials @xmath145 and @xmath146 the macroscopic distinguishability is ensured when the width sum of the two evolved packets is less than their orbital difference , that is , when @xmath147 one can not expect that this condition can always be fulfilled for all time @xmath148 .",
    "the orbital difference is determined by something like @xmath149 and the width is determined by the second derivative of the potential .",
    "but their relation is not very clear to us at present .",
    "what is clear is , to have @xmath150 one should require the points that fail the inequality form a zero measure set . on the other hand , the adiabatic approximation also imposes some restrictions on the potential .",
    "to clarify the situation further more sophisticated considerations are needed .",
    "in the context of quantum measurement , a variant of the stern - gerlach ( sg ) experiment provides an illustration of the above formalism .",
    "quantum measurement is mutationally an observing process that `` reads out '' the system states from the `` macroscopically distinguishable '' states of the detector . as is shown in the above , if the large particle moves slowly enough , an adiabatic eigen - state of the quantum system will be correlated to one of the detector states in the b - o approximation .",

    "though the spreading of an initially well localized wave packet can be reasonably ignored for the macroscopic object with very large mass , einstein argued that the superposition of two narrow wave packets is no longer narrow with respect to the macro - coordinate , but it is still a possible state of the macroscopic object .",
    "so a contradiction to the superposition principle arises because of the requirement that the wave function of a macroscopic object must be narrow . to solve this problem , wigner [ 54 ] , joos and zeh [ 55 ]",
    "present the so called scattering -induced -decoherence mechanism ( or wjz mechanism ) : scattering of photons or atoms off a macroscopic object records the information of its position to form a quantum measurement about the position . in this mechanism",
    "the interference terms between different positions are destroyed by the generalized  which - waydetection . in spirit of omnes",
    "s observation [ 56 ] , we argue that , mentioning macroscopicness implies the requirement that the macroscopic object must contain a large number of internal blocks .",
    "then the macroscopic object , coupled to the internal variables , should be described by collective variables subject to the interaction similar to that concerning the external scattering in wjz mechanism . in this section",
    "we will show that the spatial localization of a macroscopic object can be caused by an ideal entanglement between its collective position ( or center - of - mass ) and internal variables .",
    "this entanglement results from their adiabatic separation ..    let @xmath23 and @xmath22 be , respectively , the collective position and internal variables of a macroscopic object with the collective hamiltonian @xmath303 ( @xmath304=i$ ] ) . to consider how different positions affect the quantum coherence of the internal motion of the macroscopic object , we suppose that the total system is initially in a product state @xmath305 where the first component @xmath306 is the eigen - state of the collective position operator @xmath23 while @xmath70 is an arbitrary initial pure state of the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "usually , the collective motion acts on the internal motion in certain ways and the back - action of the internal motion can not be neglected physically .",
    "so this generic interaction can not produce an ideal entanglement between the collective position and the internal states of the macroscopic object . by an argument similar to that by joos and zeh [ 54 ] , who deal with quantum decoherence and its relevant localization by considering the scattering of external particles by the macroscopic object , we see only when the back - action is negligiblly small",
    ", can the interaction between the collective and internal states realize a",
    " measurement - like process ",

    "now , the question arises whether the negligibility of the back - action is the unique cause for the appearance of the above mentioned  measurement - like process  . if not , what are the other causes beyond it ? to resolve this problem , we assume the hamiltonian @xmath317 describes the motion of the internal variables @xmath22 coupling to the collective variable @xmath23 . for a fixed value of the slow variable @xmath23 , the eigen - state @xmath36\\rangle $ ] and the corresponding eigen - values @xmath35 $ ]",

    "of course in the derivation of the above factorized structure for the @xmath312 , we have made some simplifications .",
    "roughly speaking , we have assumed that the potential takes the form of direct sum and the eigenstate the form of direct product    @xmath345\\rangle = \\prod_{j=1}^n\\otimes    @xmath346 @xmath347    for the initial state @xmath348 @xmath349 factorized with respect to internal components , the reduced density matrix @xmath350 can be re - written in terms of the so called decoherence factor @xmath351}(x^{\\prime } , x , t)\\equiv \\prod_{j=1}^n\\langle \\phi _ j|s_{q_j}^{\\dagger } ( x^{\\prime } ; t)s_{q_j}(x;t)|\\phi _ j\\rangle .\\eqno{(7.15)}\\ ] ] this factor is expressed as an @xmath352-multiple product of the single decohering factors @xmath353 @xmath354with norms less than unity .",
    "thus in the macroscopic limit @xmath355 , it is possible that @xmath356 @xmath357 for @xmath358 .",
    "in fact , this factor reflects almost all the dynamic features of the influence of the fast part on the slow part .",
    "physically , an infinite @xmath352 means that the object is macroscopic since it is made of infinite number of particles in that case . on the other hand ,",
    "the happening of decoherence at infinite @xmath352 manifests a transition of the object from the quantum realm to the classical realm.here,as expected , the physical picture is consistent .    as to the localization problem raised by einstein and born [ 53 ] , we , based on the above argument , comment that one can formally write down the wave function of a macroscopic object as an narrow pure state wave packet , but it is not the whole of a real story .",
    "actually , the statement that an object is macroscopic should physically imply that it contains many particles .",
    "so a physically correct description of its state must concern its internal motions coupling to the collective coordinates ( e.g. , its center - of - mass ) .",
    "usually , one observe this collective coordinate to determine whether two spatially - localized wave packets can interfere with each other .",
    "if there does not exist such interference , one may say that , the superposition of two narrow wave packets for the macro - coordinate is no longer a possible pure state of the macroscopic object . indeed",
    ", because the `` which - way '' information of the macro - coordinate is recorded by the internal motions of particles making up the macroscopic object , the induced decohernce must destruct the coherence in the original superposition so that the state of the macroscopic object is no longer pure .",
    "the present argument also provides a possible solution for the schroedinger cat paradox .",
    "if we consider the schroedinger cat as a macroscopic object consisting of many internal particles , then we can never observe anything corresponding to the interference between the dead and the living cats because the macroscopically- dead and the macroscopically- living states of the cat are correlated to the corresponding internal states . in this sense , we conclude that the schroedinger cat paradox is not a paradox at all in practice .",
    "rather , it essentially arises from overlooking the internal motions of a macroscopic cat or the multi - particle scattering off it . turning to the problem of quantum coherence of a subsytem within the total system , from the above argument",
    "we also conclude that the classical characters of both the quantum system and the large system entangled with it are `` correlated '' physically : when the large system transits from quantum to classical realms , the quantum system has to act in the same way .",
    "in other words , you can never see a coherent superposition of microscopic states entangled to a live or a dead cat s states if the schrodinger cat is classical . in the presence of a classical cat",
    ", the quantum system entangling with it should lose its own coherence . actually ,",
    "if , in a classical manner , one asks experimentally what a quantum system really does , then the quantum system would behave physically like a classical object .",
    "this is just the quantum mystery physicists have to face .    to make a deeper elucidation of the above general arguments about the localization of a macroscopic object of mass @xmath100 , we model the macroscopic object as consisting of @xmath352 two level particles , which are fixed at certain positions to form a whole without internal spatial motion .",
    "the collective position @xmath23 is taken to be its mass - center or any reference position on it while the internal variables are the quasi - spins associated with two level particles . generally ,",
    "if we assume the back - action of the internal variables on the collective position is relatively small , the model hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath359+\\sum_{j=1}^n\\omega _",
    "j[|e_j\\rangle \\langle e_j|-|g_j\\rangle \\langle g_j|\\\\[-4 mm ] ] \\eqno{(7.16)}\\ ] ] where @xmath360 and @xmath361 are the ground and the excited states of the @xmath205 th particle and @xmath362 denote the position - dependent couplings of the collective variable to the internal variables .",
    "let @xmath363 be the relative distance between the @xmath205 th particle and the reference position @xmath30we can further assume @xmath364 physically , we may think that these couplings are induced by an inhomogeneous external field , e.g. , they may be the electric dipole couplings of two - level atoms in an inhomogeneous electric field .",
    "we remark that the above model enjoys some universality under certain conditions , compared with various environment models inducing both dissipation and decoherence of quantum processes .",
    "in fact , caldeira and leggett [ 25 ] have pointed out that any environment weakly coupling to a system may be approximated by a bath of oscillators under the condition that `` each environmental degree of freedom is only weakly perturbed by its interaction with the system '' .",
    "we observe that any linear coupling only involves transitions between the lowest two levels ( ground state and the first excitation state ) of each harmonic oscillator in the perturbation approach though it has many energy levels .",
    "therefore in such a case we can also describe the environment as a combination of many two level subsystems without losing generality [ 28].to some extent , these arguments justify our choosing the two level subsystems to model the internal motion of the macroscopic object.we will soon see its advantage : the localization characters can be manifested naturally and clearly .",

    "the influences of internal motions or external scattering on the decoherence of a macroscopic object may be very complicated .",
    "intuitively , these dynamic effects should depend on the details of interaction between the collective variables and the internal and external degrees of freedom .",
    "pratically , we can classify these influences into two species , namely , quantum dissipation and quantum decoherence , and then study them separately by different models .",
    "we remark that the quantum decoherence of a small system , resulting from a transition of the entangling `` large system '' from quantum to classical , is certainly an irreversible process .",
    "this is because the density matrices @xmath425 and @xmath426 have different ranks for @xmath427 .",
    "thus they can not be transformed into each other through an unitary time - evolution matrix .",
    "if we only consider a closed system , as a postulate with certain classical elements in it , its wpc or quantum decoherence can not be derived from schredinger equation based on the basic laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "since quantum mechanics was founded , physicists have wished to add this wpc postulate to the axiom system of quantum mechanics .",
    "von neumann and wigner made the first attempt and considered the measurement detector plus the measured system as a total system called a``universe '' satisfying schredinger equation .",
    "they hoped that , projected on the system , the evolution of the `` universe '' leads to wave packet collapse naturally .",
    "however , because it did not take the macroscopic or classical character of detector into account [ 1,2 ] , this approach brings philosophical difficulty : if the observation of the detector force the measured system to decohere , the detector must decohere in advance .",
    "so the second detector is needed to monitor the first one , and the third one is needed to monitor the second one and so on . by this argument in logic , a chain of detectors should be introduced in sequence ( we usually call it von neumann s chain),and at the end of this von neumann s chain , there should exist a pair of eyes as a special detector , which is required to be classical .    in 1972 , to avoid the introduction of this chain of detectors , hepp and coleman raised a dynamical description for the wpc via a simple exactly - solvable model .",
    "they emphasized that , if the macroscopic limit of the first detector is considered appropriately , detectors other than the first one are not necessary . using the macroscopic character of the first detector is crucial to the solution of this problem .",
    "later namiki , nakazato and pascazio et al generalized this work to put forward various new models for quantum measurement[26,27 ] . in 1993 , after carefully analyzing these models and taking the classical limit of detector into account , one of the authors ( cps ) found that the essence implied by these models is a factorization structure [ 17,18 ] .",
    "by exact- solvable models and approximately - solvable models as well , it is shown that when the effective evolution of the detector can be factorized , in the macroscopic limit that the number of particles composing the detector approachs infinity , quantum decoherence or wpc will appear naturally .",
    "previously we also associated quantum decoherence problem with the requirement that the result of a measurement should be macroscopically observable so that an ideal entanglement happens dynamically [ 21 ] .",
    "but all discussions about the interaction induced quantum decoherence strongly rely on the particular forms of interaction , namely , the interaction [ 3 ] @xmath428 of non - demolition type , which depends on the variable @xmath22 of the measured system , but commutes with its free hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , a fatal defect inherent in the previous works , including our own works , concerning the study of environment induced decoherence based on quantum measurement theory is that the question why should nature choose such a particular form of interaction remains unanswered . in some sense",
    ", the present work in this paper has well tackled this problem.indeed , through the b - o adiabatic separation of the quantum and quasi - classical variables , we have demonstrated that in the adiabatic limit , the effective interaction reduced from a quite general coupling just takes such a particular form .    in a wide sense ,",
    "the adiabatic entanglement can be well understood in the picture of coupled channels [ 50 ] , which is an extensive generalization of b - o approximation .",
    "consider a total system whose wave function depends on two set of variables , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath429 be an operator only acting on the function of @xmath22 and has a complete set of eigen - vectors @xmath430 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath431 since @xmath430 forms a complete basis of the hilbert space of all functions of @xmath432 the total eigenfunction @xmath433 of the full hamiltonian @xmath42 with eigen - value @xmath29 can be regarded as a function of @xmath22 for a given @xmath23 and then can be expressed as @xmath434 . the _ channel wave function _",
    "@xmath435 is defined by the _ coupled channel equations _",
    "@xmath436 the matrix elements @xmath437 are defined in terms of the @xmath22-function space `` integral''.under a certain condition , if the off - diagonal elements _ can be neglected physically , _ an effective non - demolition hamiltonian @xmath438 :    @xmath439\\ ] ] @xmath440,\\eqno(8.2)\\ ] ] @xmath441\\ ] ] can be partially diagonalized in the ` channel space ' . here",
    "@xmath442 for @xmath443 and @xmath444 _ are constants_. obviously , the non - demolition condition [ @xmath445 @xmath446=0 $ ] holds as @xmath447 is a constant matrix . in the b - o approximation the channel operator @xmath429 is taken to be @xmath448=h_s(q)+h_i(x",
    ", q),$]which is parametrized by @xmath30 the adiabatic condition maintains that , only the diagonal elements play a dominant role and the off - diagonal elements _ can be neglected for very small channel - channel coupling[42 ] .",
    "_ therefore , it can be concluded that there may exist a more universal mechanism beyond b - o approximation to realize the quantum decoherence dynamically originated from the basic interaction , which is related to the theory of coupled channels . _",
    "_    finally we point out that the presence of non - demolition interaction [ 3 ] is only a necessary condition for quantum decoherence to appear.sufficient conditions should include the requirement that the large system be classical so that its final states could be orthogonal to one another . in this paper",
    ", we have regarded the spin - system with a very large spin and the harmonic oscillator initially in a coherent state as classical objects . then within the semi - classical framework , even in the case of a general potential motion , we are able to relate the macroscopic distinguishibility of the quantum states of the large system to its classical limit behaviors . however , there are still vague points in the definition of the quantum - classical division for the large system .",
    "this problem is deeply rooted in the following more fundamental and more challenging issue : why or in what sense does a general large system behave classically . if we imagine that , beside the considered quantum system , there is another system coupling with the large system to decohere it , then the present problem will be trapped into an evil logic chain .",
    "one notices the difficulty here is very similar to that faced by von neumann and wigner about sixty years ago [ 1,2 ] . though new experiments have been revitalizing the study of decoherence problem and progress is being made",
    ", it seems that there is still a long way to go to finally understand quantum irreversible process completely.to reach this goal , one should first find a satisfactory definition for the so called quantum - classical boundary.at present it is very unclear to us how to do this without recourse to particular physical systems .",
