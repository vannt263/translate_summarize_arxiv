    "the question , under what conditions there exists a version of @xmath9 so that @xmath10 is almost surely continuous , has occupied many researchers in the field for many years .",
    "although , as we shall describe below , there are some very important special cases where this problem has been solved , the problem , for general borel right processes , is still unresolved .    to put this problem in context , we would like to start by highlighting some of the most important existing results in this field .",
    "the first to address this problem was trotter who in @xcite proved that when @xmath11 is the brownian motion on the real line , it has a local time at all points and ( normalized as above ) there is a version of @xmath12 that is almost surely jointly continuous . in @xcite getoor and kesten have treated the problem for standard markov processes that have a reference measure .",
    "they have established a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the above joint continuity , but with a gap between the necessary and the sufficient conditions .",
    "bass and khoshnevisan in @xcite , barlow in @xcite and barlow and hawkes in @xcite have treated the case of lvy processes taking real values that have local times at all points and for which all points communicate . in @xcite the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an almost surely , jointly continuous version of the local time @xmath10 were found .",
    "since this solution is in many ways the starting point of our approach , we shall describe it here ( or rather bertoin s @xcite `` translation '' of it ) .",
    "let @xmath13 .",
    "then one can show that @xmath14 and that @xmath15 defines a distance on @xmath16 that is equivalent to the euclidean distance .",
    "let @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the lebesgue measure of the borel set @xmath19 .",
    "barlow s necessary and sufficient condition for the continuity of the local time is the following `` majorizing measure '' condition : @xmath20 in barlow s paper @xcite the condition is stated in terms of the inverse of @xmath1 , the monotone rearrangement of @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 , then @xmath12 has a continuous version , iff @xmath23 it is easily seen that ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) are equivalent , but as was noticed by barlow and hawkes @xcite , ( [ e3 ] ) is reminiscent of fernique s @xcite and dudley s @xcite necessary and sufficient condition on the covariance function of a stationary gaussian process @xmath24 to have a continuous version .",
    "this gaussian process is precisely described in @xcite .    in a series of papers during the 1990s @xcite and in their recent book @xcite , marcus and rosen study sample path properties of the local time process of strongly symmetric markov processes . under symmetry , the potential densities are symmetric and positive definite .",
    "therefore , there exists a centered gaussian process @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the 0-potential density when the process is transient and @xmath28 for @xmath29 when the process is recurrent .",
    "now and in the sequel , @xmath30 denotes the expectation with respect to the gaussian measure .",
    "the main tool for their study is the celebrated dynkin isomorphism theorem ( dit ) @xcite , which states when @xmath11 is transient for any measurable function @xmath31 on @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the life time of the markov process @xmath11 and @xmath35 is the law of @xmath11 born at @xmath36 and killed at its last exit from the point @xmath37 .",
    "note that when @xmath11 is recurrent , the above identity is available for @xmath11 killed at an independent exponential time with parameter @xmath38 .",
    "one should notice that the right - hand side of ( [ e4 ] ) is stated in terms of the gaussian process only .    defining a distance by @xmath39 ,",
    "they have used the dit to show that @xmath12 has a jointly continuous version ( in the distance @xmath40 ) , iff the gaussian process @xmath24 has a continuous version in that distance .",
    "the latter happens iff for every compact set @xmath41 , in the metric @xmath40 , there exists a probability measure @xmath42 on @xmath43 , the @xmath44-algebra on @xmath41 generated by the @xmath40-open sets , so that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a @xmath40-ball of radius @xmath47 around @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath49 is jointly continuous those conditions translate to a condition for the joint continuity ( in the original distance ) of @xmath50 . as in the case treated by barlow , the condition for the joint continuity of the local time is identical to the condition for the continuity of a gaussian process .    extending these results beyond the symmetric and lvy cases , and understanding the intriguing connection between the conditions for the continuity of local times of markov processes and those of gaussian processes is the objective of this paper .",

    "it in such a way that it becomes recurrent , still keeping properties that will be used below like duality or symmetry if the original process was symmetric . since the continuity and other fine properties of local times are local , and recurrence is a long time behavior property of the process , it has nothing to do with local properties , and therefore , using le jan s construction , we can extend the results to the transient case . with that in mind , and assuming that @xmath11 is recurrent ,",

    "we now choose @xmath350 big enough to satisfy all the above inequalities and make this last bound smaller than @xmath355 .",
