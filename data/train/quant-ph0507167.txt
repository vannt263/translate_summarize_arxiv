    "as fermion optics research grows , spurred for example by applications to fermionic quantum information processing  @xcite , the formal question of how to deal with fermionic coherence mathematically becomes important . for bosons ,",
    "the natural way to describe coherence and optics is in terms of complex - parametrized coherent states , which are eigenstates of the mode annihilation operator , and then employ the optical equivalence theorem  @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis for fermions is forbidden because the only complex - parametrized eigenstate of fermion annihilation operators is the vacuum state , but formally a well - behaved fermion coherent state can be introduced by parametrizing with grassman numbers  @xcite rather than complex numbers , which overcomes challenges due to anticommutativity relations  @xcite .",
    "these ` grassman coherent states ' are eigenstates of the fermion annihilation operators with grassman - valued eigenvalues  @xcite and formally demonstrate many of the desirable coherence properties of bosons  @xcite .",
    "although the grassmann coherent state representation provides a beautiful analogy to the boson coherent state and its use in quantum optics experiments  @xcite , the disadvantage is that the grassmann algebra and the resulting grassmann coherent state do not convey a clear physical picture of coherence .",
    "complex parameters can be understood in terms of amplitude ( the modulus of the complex parameter ) and phase ( the argument of the complex parameter ) of the field . here",
    "we explore whether complex parametrization can be employed in some advantageous way to analyze coherence of fermionic systems .",
    "this analysis entails defining an approximate complex - parametrized fermionic coherent state , identifying the four chief desirable properties of coherent states , and show that these approximate fermionic coherent states dismally fail every single criterion , which leads to the conclusion that complex parametrization is not useful even for approximations to fermion coherent states for any of the four criteria .",
    "this strong and negative result further reinforces the importance of using grassman numbers to connect fermion and boson coherence in one formalism .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the number state representation for bosons and fermions in sec .",
    "[ number_states ] , and review boson coherent states in sec .",
    "[ csboson ] . then , in sec .  [ csfermions ] , we show why complex fermion coherent states in a direct analogy with the boson case are impossible and we make an attempt to introduce `` approximate fermion coherent states '' . in sec .",
    "[ fcf ] , we derive a number of properties of normally - ordered fermion correlators and based on these properties we show that no multi - particle fermion state can , even approximately , factorize correlation functions",
    ". finally we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in this paper we denote the boson and fermion annihilation and creation operators by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . the boson ( fermion ) operators satisfy the following commutation ( anticommutation ) relations @xmath2&=\\delta_{ij}\\openone,\\quad    [ \\hat a_i,\\hat a_j]=0,\\quad   [ \\hat a_i^\\dagger,\\hat a_j^\\dagger]=0\\\\    \\label{crf }    \\{\\hat c_i,\\hat c_j^\\dagger\\}&=\\delta_{ij}\\openone,\\quad    \\{\\hat c_i,\\hat c_j\\}=0,\\quad   \\{\\hat c_i^\\dagger,\\hat c_j^\\dagger\\}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 the kronecker delta and @xmath4 labeling an orthonormal set of modes .",
    "number states are states with a definite number of particles in a given mode .",
    "they are eigenstates of the particle number operator ( @xmath5 for bosons and @xmath6 for fermions ) such that @xmath7 .",
    "the lowest number state , the vacuum @xmath8 , has no particle , and higher number states can be generated from @xmath8 by the action of the creation operator that raises the particle number by one . for bosons ,",
    "this action is as follows , @xmath9 while for fermions @xmath10 and the latter formula follows from the anticommutation relations  ( [ crf ] ) .",
    "hence , for bosons the number of particles @xmath11 can have any non - negative integer value while for fermions the only allowed values are 0 and 1 .",
    "this reflects pauli s exclusion principle , which states that there can not be two fermions in the same state .",
    "the action of the annihilation operator on number states is the following : @xmath12 the extension of single - mode number to multi - mode number states in general utilizes an arbitrary , but established , ordered set of single - mode states @xmath13 with ordered occupation numbers @xmath14 .",
    "the established ordering accommodates the potential sign changes that occur due to the particular algebra chosen to represent the quantum statistics of the system . in practice",
    ", this ordering is determined through an arbitrary , but established , ordering of the creation and annihilation operators which act on the vacuum state @xmath15 ( no ordering required now within the ket ) , and the consequence of this ordering is maintained through the use of the appropriate operator algebra used when manipulating the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "in the case of multi - mode boson fields , the commuting algebra introduces a simplification : the operator ordering for different modes becomes irrelevant for commuting operators .",
    "for example , the state with one boson in mode  1 and one boson in mode  2 can be obtained from the two - mode vacuum in two equivalent ways : @xmath16 although one may consider the ordering in eq .",
    "( [ multimodeb1 ] ) to be the established ordering , there is no distinction between the resultant state in eq .",
    "( [ multimodeb1 ] ) and the one in eq .",
    "( [ multimodeb2 ] ) which uses a different ordering .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the commuting algebra used for boson fields .",
    "it is for this reason that one may use the number state notation [ left - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ multimodeb1 ] ) and ( [ multimodeb2 ] ) ] and the operator notation [ right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ multimodeb1 ] ) and ( [ multimodeb2 ] ) ] interchangeably with boson fields without regard for the established ordering between different modes .    however , ordering is important for fields which do not use a commuting algebra .",
    "for example , the state with one fermion in mode  1 and one fermion in mode  2 can be obtained from the two - mode vacuum in two different ways : @xmath17 in the fermion case , the resulting states are not identical , @xmath18 , because of the fermion anti - commutation algebra @xmath19 ( see eq .",
    "( [ crf ] ) ) .",
    "this illustrates the point that in general an arbitrary , but established , _ a priori _ ordering is required . from the practical point of view , it is better to identify a multi - mode number state by a product of creation operators that operate on an unordered vacuum state ( see the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ multimodef1 ] ) , ( [ multimodef2 ] ) ) rather than by the ordered occupation - number notation ( see the left - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ multimodef1 ] ) and ( [ multimodef2 ] ) ) .",
    "the question of ordering fermion modes explained above becomes unimportant for mixtures of fermion number states , as we show in appendix  [ chaoticsection ] .",
    "this is significant as it is mixtures of number states , usually in the form of chaotic states , that are most often encountered in a real physical system .",
    "chaotic states of bosons and fermions are discussed in more detail in appendix  [ appendix : chaotic ] .",
    "boson coherent states can be introduced is several ways that emphasize its different physical or mathematical properties .",
    "here we consider four interrelated ways .",
    "_ eigenstates of the annihilation operator :  _",
    "a common definition is that the boson coherent state is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator , @xmath20 this yields the expansion of a coherent state in terms of number states : @xmath21 to define a multi - mode boson coherent state , consider the complete set of boson modes indexed by @xmath22 that can be assumed to form a countable set @xmath23 .",
    "a multi - mode boson coherent state is then an eigenstate of all annihilation operators @xmath24 .    _",
    "displaced vacuum state :  _ the boson coherent state can also be defined as a displaced vacuum state @xmath25 in other words , the boson coherent state is a member of the orbit of the vacuum state under the action of the heisenberg - weyl group @xmath26 , which is parametrized over the complex field .",
    "this definition readily extends to multi - mode fields where @xmath27 is the group action for the @xmath28 mode , and the displacement operators for different modes commute with each other .",
    "_ linear mode coupler :  _ the third option for defining boson coherent states is connected to their behavior under the action of a linear mode coupler .",
    "a linear mode coupler is an important element for transforming both boson and fermion fields and it is realized by a beam splitter for optical fields and as a quantum point contact for confined electron gases .",
    "furthermore linear loss mechanisms can be described as linear coupling between the signal mode and the environmental modes . for bosons ,",
    "coherent states remain coherent states under linear loss .",
    "the boson coherent states have the following special property .",
    "they are the only states , when mixed on a linear mode coupler with the vacuum state , yield a two - mode product state , which is at the same time the two - mode product coherent state  @xcite .",
    "this property is important because it tells that multi - mode coherent states remain as multi - mode coherent states under the action of mode coupling and linear loss .",
    "_ factorization of correlators :  _ the last possibility considered here for defining boson coherent states is related to the normally - ordered correlators ( correlation functions )  @xcite @xmath29 whose complete factorization is identified with the property of coherence . here",
    "@xmath30 is the boson annihilation operator at the point @xmath31 , i.e. , the sum of annihilation operators of the complete set of modes weighted by the spatial mode functions .",
    "a boson coherent state is then a state for which all the normally - ordered correlators factorize , i.e. , for which @xmath32 this definition is especially important as the concept of boson coherent states was developed by glauber  @xcite to describe coherence of the electromagnetic field , and coherent states were defined to factorize the normally - ordered correlators in analogy to classical states of the filed .",
    "in fact there is some ambiguity in the definition of the boson coherent state according to this factorizability condition . with the displaced vacuum state in eq .",
    "( [ displaced ] ) , the phase of the coefficient for fock state  @xmath33 is @xmath34 , but the correlator factorizes for an arbitrary phase @xmath35 while the magnitudes of the coefficients have to remain the same . generalized coherent states that satisfy the coherence condition were studied by titulaer and glauber  @xcite .",
    "the boson coherent state  ( [ displaced ] ) is a special case of states in this class .",
    "_ summary :  _ each of the four definitions given above are equivalent , which we prove in appendix  [ appen - equiv ] . in the following section we consider extending each of these approaches to constructing coherent states to the fermion case .    for completeness",
    ", we mention another appealing feature of boson coherent states , namely the gaussian statistics governing field quadrature measurements , for example by homodyne detection @xcite . for fermions",
    ", there is no obvious way to extend the notion of quadratures so we omit this approach to constructing fermion coherent states .",
    "_ eigenstates of the annihilation operator :  _ for fermions , the only eigenstate of the annihilation operator with complex coefficient is the vacuum state @xmath8 . indeed , acting on a general pure state @xmath36 by the annihilation operator yields the resultant state @xmath37 , which is not a multiple of @xmath38 unless @xmath39 .",
    "however , if @xmath40 is small , then @xmath41 is close to some multiple of @xmath38 , which motivates the consideration of `` approximate complex fermion coherent states '' .",
    "one may define an @xmath42-complex fermion coherent state as follows . for a given @xmath43 , an @xmath42-complex fermion coherent state",
    "is a normalized state @xmath44 , which satisfies @xmath45 here @xmath46 denotes the norm of a vector , namely @xmath47 .",
    "[ epsilon - fermion coherent state ] for @xmath48 , the normalized state @xmath49 is an @xmath42-complex fermion coherent state if @xmath50 .    minimizing the norm of the vector @xmath51 over @xmath52 , we find that the minimum occurs for @xmath53 .",
    "evaluating then the norm for this particular @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55 . hence ,",
    "if @xmath50 , then @xmath56 is an @xmath42-fermion coherent state .",
    "if @xmath57 , one may refer to the @xmath42-complex fermion coherent state as an `` approximate complex fermion coherent state '' .",
    "clearly , @xmath42 bounds the occupation probability for a single particle , and in the limit @xmath58 the set of `` approximate complex fermion coherent states '' reduces to the vacuum state .",
    "however , attempting to generalize such a definition of the `` approximate complex fermion coherent state '' to a many - mode system introduces important difficulties . because the fermion annihilation operators of different modes are non - commuting , it is in principle not possible to find a common eigenstate , with complex eigenvalue , even if a non - trivial eigenstate of the annihilation operator of a single mode existed .",
    "further , to generalize eq .",
    "( [ appr_coh ] ) , one would need to prescribe the ordering of the actions of the operators on the vacuum , which is a step without physical justification .",
    "this problem will be discussed in the next paragraph .    _",

    "( [ displaced ] ) ] .",
    "we can therefore call @xmath61 the complex fermion displacement operator .",
    "any single - mode complex fermion pure state can be obtained from the vacuum state by applying a particular @xmath62 : that is , every pure fermion state is in the orbit of the vacuum under the action of the displacement operator .",
    "if fermion coherent states were defined as displaced vacuum states , then any single - mode fermion pure state would be a coherent state , which would not yield a very useful definition of coherent states .",
    "however , one may still define `` approximate complex fermion coherent states '' according to eq .",
    "( [ ferm_displacement ] ) with @xmath63 .    to generalize this definition to a multi - mode system",
    ", one would have to be careful .",
    "a nave approach would be to act consecutively by displacement operators of the individual modes on the vacuum , without considering the ordering of these operators .",
    "however , displacement operators for different modes neither commute nor anticommute so ordering influences the resultant state . for a given set of @xmath64 , and a given permutation @xmath65 of the modes @xmath66",

    "hence single - mode `` approximate complex fermion coherent states '' approximately satisfy the coherence properties in the same way as `` approximate boson coherent states '' , which are obtained from weak boson coherent states by truncating the particle number beyond one .",
    "it therefore appears that the use of grassmann numbers , which obviate the problem of anticommuting operators but introduce an unphysical parametrization , are needed to create self - consistent fermion coherent states that satisfy the expected coherence properties  @xcite ; complex parametrized fermion coherent states do not appear to be useful , even approximately .",

    "the relation between @xmath137 and @xmath136 is @xmath138 with @xmath139 a unitary matrix .",
    "let an eigenstate @xmath56 of @xmath140 incide on the first linear mode coupler input port , and vacuum incide on the second input port , which is an eigenstate of @xmath141 with eigenvalue zero .",
    "it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ linear mode couplertransform ] ) that the linear mode coupler output state is an eigenstate of @xmath142 and @xmath143 , which is a product state of the linear mode coupler outputs .",
    "next we show ( c ) @xmath134 ( b ) : let the boson coherent state incident on linear mode coupler be expressed in the fock basis as follows : @xmath144 the series @xmath145 formally defines a function of the creation operator @xmath146 that we will denote by @xmath147 .",
    "the linear mode coupler input state is then @xmath148 as there is vacuum at the second input port .",
    "the relation between @xmath149 and @xmath150 following from eq .",
    "( [ linear mode couplertransform ] ) is @xmath151 .",
    "therefore the output linear mode coupler state is @xmath152 .",
    "according to our assumption , this is a product state of output modes @xmath153 , so it must hold @xmath154 with @xmath155 some functions . as @xmath156 and @xmath157 commute , we can treat @xmath158 as ordinary functions of , say , arguments @xmath31 and @xmath113 instead of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "then , denoting @xmath161 , making logarithm of eq .",
    "( [ cond_exp ] ) and performing the derivative @xmath162 , we arrive at the condition @xmath163 for both @xmath164 and @xmath165 different from zero ( the opposite would correspond to a trivial linear mode coupler  either doing nothing or interchanging the modes 1 and 2 ) , this is possible only if @xmath166 is a linear function , i.e. , if @xmath167 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath168 .",
    "however , then @xmath148 is a displaced vacuum state ( up to a normalization constant ) because the campbell - hausdorff - baker formula yields @xmath169    to show ( b ) @xmath134 ( a ) means to show that @xmath170 is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator . displacing the annihilation operator , we have @xmath171 which we wanted to prove .",
    "next we show ( a ) @xmath134 ( d ) : the field operators @xmath30 and @xmath172 are linear combinations of single - mode annihilation operators @xmath173 and creation operators @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "any ( possibly multi - mode ) coherent state is therefore a right eigenstate of @xmath30 and left eigenstate of @xmath172 . from this",
    "the factorization  ( [ factorization ] ) follows immediately .",
    "correlators are important tools for describing coherence of both boson and fermion fields .",
    "they are defined as expectation values of products of creation and annihilation operators at different space - time points .",
    "the fermion correlators of the @xmath175 order are defined by analogy to their boson counterparts @xmath176 ( we use the greek letter @xmath177 to distinguish from the boson correlator  @xmath178 ) .",
    "of particular importance is the correlator with repeated arguments , for which we introduce the shorter expression @xmath179 , which corresponds to the @xmath11-fermion detection probability , and also the one - fermion cross - correlator @xmath180 .",
    "the normalized first - order cross - correlator @xmath181 is called _ complex degree of coherence _ and its magnitude expresses the visibility of interference fringes in a double - slit experiment in which the two slits are placed at the points @xmath31 and @xmath113 , respectively  @xcite . if @xmath98 for all @xmath100 , we say that the field has perfect first - order coherence .",
    "we will show now that for chaotic states , the fermion or boson nature of the particles does not have an effect on the first - order correlator while it has a strong effect on the higher - order correlators .",
    "for a chaotic state  @xcite , each mode of the chaotic field has maximum entropy for a given mean number of particles in this mode , and the density operator of the field is a direct product of single - mode density operators .",
    "this second property simply implies that , in the chaotic state , the individual modes of the field are totally uncorrelated .    the chaotic state density operator of a single mode of bosons or fermions with mean number of particles @xmath182 can be expressed as @xmath183 with @xmath184 for bosons and @xmath185 for fermions ( unlike previous sections , here we denote the fermion field operators by @xmath0 rather than @xmath1 for compact notation ) .",
    "thus we have the density operators for bosons and fermions in the following forms : @xmath186    consider now a multi - mode chaotic field of bosons or fermions .",
    "let there be @xmath69 occupied modes labeled by @xmath187 and let the mean number of particles in the @xmath188 mode be @xmath189 . for brevity",
    ", we denote the boson and fermion correlators by @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively , in this section .",
    "the first order cross - correlator @xmath192 can readily be calculated and has the same form for bosons and fermions : @xmath193 eq .",
    "( [ chaotic - first ] ) shows that the first order coherence ( which is related to the visibility of interference fringes ) for chaotic states is not at all influenced by the fermion or boson nature of the particles , provided the mean occupation numbers are the same .",
    "this can be expected as the first order correlator is not related to multi - particle correlations so it should not be affected by the exchange interaction .",
    "the @xmath194-order correlator can also be calculated for the chaotic state .",
    "the following formula holds exactly for fermions and for bosons it holds with good accuracy if @xmath195 : @xmath196 here the sum runs over all permutations @xmath65 of the indices @xmath197 , the parity of the permutation @xmath65 is denoted by @xmath198 , and @xmath199 , @xmath200 is the boson and fermion sign factor , respectively .",
    "hence the higher - order correlators are no longer identical for boson and fermion chaotic states , which is manifested as bunching ( antibunching ) for boson ( fermion ) chaotic fields .",
    "if @xmath201 , @xmath191 goes to zero according to eq .",
    "( [ chaotic - nth ] ) due to the factor @xmath202 , which is in agreement with the general property of fermion correlators ( proposition  [ antibunching1 ] ) .",
