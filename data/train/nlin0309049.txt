    "based on earlier ideas of wigner @xcite dyson introduced a three - fold classification of quantum systems according to their behavior under time - reversal and spin rotation @xcite .",
    "this symmetry classification turned out to be very useful , for instance in semiclassical , disordered and random - matrix approaches to complex quantum systems .",
    "the success of random - matrix theory is based on universal features in spectra of complex quantum systems . while not capable of predicting single eigenvalues random - matrix theory has become one of the key ingredients in predicting physical features that depend on non - trivial spectral statistics @xcite . in each symmetry class",
    "various universality classes have been identified ",
    "each described by some ensemble of random matrices .",
    "most prominent are the three gaussian ensembles gue , goe and gse .",
    "they define the _ ergodic universality classes _ and they have been applied successfully to a wide range of quantum systems ( see the recent review @xcite for an overview and further references ) .",
    "recently the three - fold classification has been extended to a ten - fold classification by incorporating spectral mirror symmetries .",
    "this lead to seven novel symmetry classes @xcite .",
    "they are partly realized for a dirac particle in a random gauge field , and for quasi - particles in disordered superconductors or normalconducting - superconducting hybrid systems . in the presence of a spectral mirror symmetry",
    "the spectrum is symmetric with respect to one point @xmath0 : if @xmath1 is in the spectrum so is @xmath2 .",
    "the invention of the novel classes has become necessary due to the impact such a symmetry has on spectral correlations .",
    "these new universal features appear near the symmetry point @xmath0 and they can be described by defining random - matrix ensembles which incorporate the corresponding spectral mirror symmetry .",
    "it has been conjectured by bohigas , giannoni and schmit that the spectra of classically chaotic systems display the spectral fluctuations described by the three gaussian wigner - dyson ensembles of random - matrix theory @xcite .",
    "though the fidelity to the universal predictions of random - matrix theory have an overwhelming support by both experimental and numerical data the physical basis of universality is not completely understood .",
    "quantum graphs have been introduced by kottos and smilansky @xcite as simple quantum models with an exact semiclassical trace formula for the density of states which is expressed as a sum over periodic orbits on the graph .",
    "they have since become an important tool in the semiclassical approach to universality . in this series of papers we will construct star graphs for all ten symmetry classes and investigate their spectral statistics both numerically and analytically . while the following paper @xcite is devoted to a semiclassical periodic - orbit approach this paper focusses on the construction of appropriate star graphs and some numerical results .",
    "we start with giving a short introduction to the ten symmetry classes in section [ sec : symmetry ] with all details needed for the subsequent construction of star graphs . in the following section [ sec : universality ] on spectral statistics",
    "we introduce the spectral form factors , review the results of gaussian random - matrix theory for the ten symmetry classes and generalize the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture . after a general introduction to quantum graphs in section [ sec : stargraphs ] we construct one ensemble of star graphs for each of the ten symmetry classes .",
    "numerical results then show the fidelity of these ensembles to the predictions of the gaussian random - matrix ensembles .",
    "in quantum mechanics most symmetries are described by some unitary operators @xmath3 that commute with the hamilton operator @xmath4 .",
    "thus the operators @xmath3 ( or its hermitian generators ) describe constants of motion and they lead to a block diagonal form of the hamilton matrix in an eigenbasis of @xmath3 . if enough constants of motion @xmath5 are available such that the corresponding hermitian generators form a complete set of _ commuting _ observables the hamilton operator is eventually diagonalized in the common eigenbasis of the symmetry operators ( or their generators ) .",
    "however , for any hermitian hamilton operator @xmath6 there is always a complete set of commuting hermitian operators @xmath7 which also commute with the hamilton operator ( e.g.  projectors on eigenstates ) . in some sense",
    "the notion of symmetry in this wide sense is obsolete for a single quantum system .",
    "however , in most cases such a set of commuting operators will not have any corresponding classical observable and will only apply to a single system .",
    "it is more appropriate for our purposes to consider a family or class of quantum systems .",
    "such a family may arrise by varying some physical parameters ( like the strength of an applied magnetic field ) or , for disordered systems , by an ensemble of random potentials . in the derivation and application of semiclassical methods",
    "one formally considers the asymptotics @xmath8 which is equivalent to a family of operators with fixed @xmath9 but some varying physical parameters .",
    "a unitary operator @xmath5 is a unitary symmetry of a class of systems if it commutes with all hamilton operators in that class .",
    "this notion avoids `` symmetry '' operators that would rely on a diagonalization of the hamilton operator . in semiclassics a unitary symmetry will have a classical correspondence . in the sequel",
    "we will consider each hamilton operator as a member of a class without explicitly referring to it .",
    "if a family of systems has a unitary symmetry all its hamilton operators can be brought to a blockdiagonal form .",
    "each block can be regarded as a new hamilton operator on a reduced hilbert space .",
    "let us assume that the hilbert space is completely reduced such that there are no more unitary symmetries .",
    "what types of symmetry may such a reduced quantum system still have ?",
    "what are the possible structures of the hamilton operator ( or the hamilton matrix ) and what are the consequences on its spectrum and its eigenvectors ?",
    "such questions were for the first time addressed and partially answered by wigner and dyson @xcite .",
    "dyson proposed a symmetry classification based on the behavior of quantum systems under time - reversal and spin rotation .",
    "this lead to three symmetry classes ( the three - fold way ) : _ i. _ systems that are not time - reversal invariant , _ ii . _ time - reversal invariant spin - less particles , and _ iii . _ time - reversal invariant particles with spin @xmath10 .",
    "time - reversal symmetry has immediate consequences on the form of the hamilton operator : spin - less particles can be described by real symmetric hamilton matrices in a time - reversal invariant basis , while systems without time - reversal invariance do not have any canonical basis and the hamilton matrix remains complex .",
    "the influence of the symmetry class on spectral properties such as level repulsion has been investigated extensively within the field of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "we will give more details on random matrix theory in section [ sec : universality ] .",
    "recently the wigner - dyson symmetry classification has been extended to a ten - fold way by including all different types of mirror symmetries in the spectrum @xcite . in the presence of a spectral mirror symmetry",
    "every eigenvalue @xmath1 has a partner eigenvalue at @xmath2 ( we will set @xmath11 in the sequel without loss of generality ) . below we will describe the various ways",
    "a mirror symmetry may arise and be combined with time - reversal invariance .",
    "this leads to the seven novel symmetry classes . as shown in @xcite",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between cartan s ten - fold classification of riemannian symmetric spaces and the ten symmetry classes of quantum systems .",
    "we will use the convention to adopt the names given by cartan to the different classes of symmetric spaces for the according symmetry classes .",
    "the novel symmetry classes are partly realized for dirac fermions in a random potential ( the _ chiral classes _ ) @xcite and partly for quasi - particles in mesoscopic superconductors or superconducting - normalconducting ( sn ) hybrid systems ( the _ andreev classes _ ) .",
    "it is possible to construct much more general systems in the appropriate symmetry classes , e.g.  two coupled spins or a generalized version of the pauli equation ( which includes the bogoliubov - de - gennes equation as a special case ) , and quantum graphs .",
    "quantum maps which incorporate the corresponding symmetries have been discussed recently @xcite . due to their simplicity graphs",
    "will be the focus of this work .",

    "equivalently , when @xmath12 is applied to the retarded green s operator @xmath18 one gets @xmath19 which is just the advanced green s operator .    time - reversal symmetry also effects other dynamic operators  such as the unitary time evolution operator @xmath20 scattering problems can often be described by some unitary operator @xmath21 that connects incoming and outgoing states of energy @xmath22 .",
    "time - reversal invariance leads to @xmath23 these equations also define time - reversal symmetry for quantum maps .",
    "the transformation of the time development operator follows immediately from the condition on the hamiltonian . in scattering problems",
    "@xmath21 can be related to a unitary combination of green s functions  for definiteness consider @xmath24 and equation follows from the transformation of @xmath25 .",
    "we have used the term _ generalized _ time - reversal operator because @xmath12 need not be the well - known conventional time - reversal operator . for a particle in @xmath26 the anti - unitary conventional time - reversal operator obeys @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the particle spin .",
    "this conventional time - reversal operator obeys @xmath29 if the spin quantum number is integer @xmath30 , and @xmath31 if the spin is half - integer @xmath32 .",
    "thus the most relevant and simplest realizations are for spin - less ( @xmath29 ) and spin-@xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) particles .",
    "when a given quantum system is studied one should be aware that a generalized time - reversal operator may still exist which commutes with the hamiltonian while the conventional time - reversal operator may not commute with @xmath6 .",
    "the consideration of time - reversal symmetries leads to three symmetry classes : either a system is not time - reversal invariant , or it is time - reversal invariant  in the latter case the time - reversal operator either obeys @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "these classes have been called _ wigner - dyson classes _ and their impact on the form of hamilton matrices and universal spectral features will be discussed further in section [ sec : wigner - dyson ] and [ sec : universality ] .",

    "it is straight forward to show that @xmath39 is orthogonal to @xmath37 using the properties of the time reversal symmetry operator .",
    "this degeneracy is well known for spin-@xmath33 particles with conventional time - reversal symmetry .",
