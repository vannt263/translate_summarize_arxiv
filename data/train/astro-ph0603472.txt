    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) contains an extensive population of massive star clusters , with ages ranging from the very newly formed ( e.g. , r136 with age @xmath11 myr ) to those with ages comparable to the galactic globular clusters ( e.g. , hodge 11 ) .",
    "these objects are extremely useful not only for studies of cluster development , but also for tracing the formation history of the lmc and its related kinematic , structural , and chemical evolution .    of particular interest in this respect",
    "is the distribution of star cluster ages .",
    "a number of authors have explicitly demonstrated , using high quality colour - magnitude diagrams , that the oldest globular clusters in the lmc are coeval with the oldest galactic globular clusters , to within @xmath12 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "with the recent addition of ngc 1928 and 1939 , the census of objects constituting this group of ancient clusters numbers @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "there also exists a very substantial population of young and intermediate age clusters ; however , examination of the age distribution reveals an almost complete dearth of clusters older than @xmath14 gyr but younger than the ancient ensemble ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this curious distribution constitutes the well known lmc cluster age - gap .",
    "recent research aimed at explaining the existence of the age - gap has focused on the impact of the periodic strong tidal interactions between the lmc and its companion the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) @xcite .",
    "only one cluster is suspected to lie within the age gap .",
    "this is the remote northern lmc member eso 121-sc03 , which lies at a projected angular separation of @xmath15 from the lmc centre .",
    "eso 121-sc03 was first studied in detail by @xcite , who used @xmath16 photometry to estimate an age in the range @xmath17 gyr .",
    "subsequent work has not altered this conclusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given its apparently unique age , and interesting spatial location , eso 121-sc03 clearly constitutes an object worthy of detailed study .",
    "we were therefore surprised to discover that it apparently has not been the subject of deep high - resolution imaging : we could only locate two independent published cmds in the literature  the @xmath16 photometry of @xcite , and the washington photometry of @xcite .",
    "neither of these studies reaches more than @xmath12 mag below the main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) , and indeed in both , the turn - off is only measured at low signal - to - noise .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the existence of observations of eso 121-sc03 taken with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on _ hst _ as part of our recent snapshot survey of lmc and smc star clusters ( program 9891 ) , to make deep , high quality photometric measurements of this cluster .",
    "our resulting @xmath18 cmd reaches more than @xmath0 magnitudes below the main - sequence turn - off , representing by far the deepest observations of eso 121-sc03 to date .",
    "we use these data to conduct a detailed study of the age of eso 121-sc03 relative to two comparison clusters  the young accreted sagittarius dsph globular cluster palomar 12 ( also imaged with acs in program 9891 ) , and the old galactic globular cluster 47 tuc .",
    "we find that eso 121-sc03 is significantly younger than 47 tuc , but very similar in age to pal .",
    "12 , confirming the earlier conclusion of @xcite and @xcite that eso 121-sc03 does indeed lie squarely within the lmc cluster age - gap .",
    "the observations were taken during _ hst _",
    "cycle 12 using the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) . as snapshot targets ,",
    "the clusters were observed for only one orbit each .",
    "this allowed two exposures to be taken per cluster ",
    "one through the f555w filter and one through the f814w filter .",
    "details of the individual exposures are listed in table [ t : observations ] .",
    "the acs wfc consists of a mosaic of two @xmath19 site ccds with a scale of @xmath20 arcsec per pixel , and separated by a gap of @xmath21 pixels .",
    "each image therefore covers a field of view ( fov ) of approximately @xmath22 arcseconds .",
    "the clusters were centred at the reference point wfc1 , located on chip 1 at position @xmath23 .",
    "this allowed any given cluster to be observed up to a radius @xmath24 from its centre , while also ensuring the cluster core did not fall near the inter - chip gap .",
    "our observations were made with the acs / wfc gain parameter set to @xmath25 .",
    "this allows the full well depth to be sampled ( as opposed to only @xmath26 per cent of the full well depth for gain @xmath27 ) with only a modest increase in read noise ( @xmath28 e@xmath29 extra rms ) , thus increasing the dynamic range of the observations by greater than @xmath30 mag over that obtained with the default gain .",
    "in addition , we offset the second image of each cluster by @xmath25 pixels in both the @xmath31 and @xmath32 directions , to help facilitate the removal of hot pixels and cosmic rays . with only two images per cluster , through different filters , it is not possible to completely eliminate the inter - chip gap using such an offset .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     next , we applied our theoretical age calibration in order to obtain relative age estimates from the horizontal method .",
    "the results may be seen in table [ t : ageshoriz ] .",
    "as previously , we used the @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 = -0.83 $ ] and @xmath33fe@xmath3 = 0.0 $ ] polynomial fit for pal .",
    "12 ; the @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 = -0.83 $ ] and @xmath33fe@xmath3 = + 0.3 $ ] polynomial fit for 47 tuc ; and the polynomials with @xmath1fe@xmath2h@xmath3 = -1.01 $ ] and @xmath33fe@xmath3 = 0.0 $ ] or @xmath34 for eso 121-sc03 .    from table",
    "[ t : ageshoriz ] , it can be seen that the horizontal indicator is apparently more sensitive to @xmath6-element abundance than is the vertical indicator , although we note that the supposed variation with @xmath6-abundance is of the same order as the quoted errors .",
    "overall , using the horizontal indicator we found eso 121-sc03 to have an age @xmath35 per cent that of 47 tuc , in good agreement with our result from the vertical indicator .",
    "similarly , eso 121-sc03 has an age @xmath36 per cent that of pal .",
    "12 . for comparison , we find pal .",
    "12 to be @xmath37 per cent of the age of 47 tuc , which is again in agreement with the relative age we derived using the vertical indicator ( @xmath38 per cent ) .    based on the absolute ages for 47 tuc discussed earlier",
    ", we find that from our horizontal method calculations , the age of eso 121-sc03 lies in the range @xmath39 gyr .",
    "in this paper we have presented photometric measurements from acs / wfc imaging of eso 121-sc03 in the f555w and f814w passbands .",
    "the resulting cmd represents the deepest and most precise published photometry for this unique lmc globular cluster .",
    "we have also presented new acs / wfc photometry for the accreted sagittarius dsph globular cluster palomar 12 . using these data ,",
    "we have conducted a detailed study of the age of eso 121-sc03 .",
    "specifically , we have derived its age relative to the comparison clusters pal .",
    "12 and 47 tuc using vertical and horizontal dating methods calibrated against the stellar evolution models of @xcite .",
    "these are well sampled in metallicity and allow us to account for the uncertain run of @xmath6-elements in eso 121-sc03 , as well as the fact that pal .",
    "12 is deficient in @xmath6-elements compared to many galactic globulars , including 47 tuc .",
    "our main result is that eso 121-sc03 is significantly younger than 47 tuc , but rather similar in age to pal .",
    "this conclusion is independent of assumed @xmath6-element abundance and age - dating method . taking a straight error - weighted mean of our age measurements",
    "yields eso 121-sc03 to be @xmath7 per cent the age of 47 tuc , and @xmath8 per cent the age of palomar 12 .",
    "palomar 12 is in turn @xmath9 per cent as old as 47 tuc , in good agreement with previous measurements . as discussed in section [ ss : vertical ] , recent results suggest the oldest galactic globular clusters have ages of @xmath40 gyr",
    ". however , there is some disagreement in the literature as to whether 47 tuc is coeval with the oldest galactic globulars , or @xmath41 per cent younger .",
    "this uncertainty translates to an absolute age range for eso 121-sc03 , spanning @xmath42 gyr .",
    "similarly , the absolute age of pal .",
    "12 lies in the range @xmath43 gyr .",
    "typical errors on all these ages are @xmath44 gyr .    our new , deep photometry and precise age estimate fully confirms eso 121-sc03 as the only known lmc cluster with an age placing it squarely within the age - gap . in this respect , it is clearly a unique object which may well be able to tell us important information about the formation and evolution of the lmc .",
    "does this cluster represent the tail - end of ancient globular cluster formation in the lmc , just as pal .",
    "12 and terzan 7 do for the sagittarius dsph galaxy ?",
    "if so , then how can we reconcile this picture and the observed metallicity of eso 121-sc03 with its remote location in the very outer lmc halo ?",
    "other ancient globular clusters at similar radii ( such as ngc 1841 and reticulum ) are considerably more metal poor .    prompted by the observation that eso 121-sc03 is surrounded by a field population which shares the same properties as the cluster , @xcite speculated that eso 121-sc03 may represent part of a recently accreted lmc building block ( or dwarf galaxy ) .",
    "we note however , that @xcite found the age and metallicity of this cluster to be consistent with the age - metallicity relation they derived from lmc field star observations ; hence they concluded the accretion of eso 121-sc03 not a necessity .",
    "even so , it would clearly be of interest to examine in more detail the possibility that eso 121-sc03 is a captured object .    by analogue with known accreted clusters in the galactic halo ( such as pal .",
    "12 ) , we may expect three characteristics of eso 121-sc03 if it is indeed a captured cluster .",
    "first it may exhibit a peculiar velocity , at odds with that expected from the observed dynamics of the lmc .",
    "second , we may hope to observe the presence of some stream or anomalous stellar population surrounding the cluster .",
    "finally , it may be possible that eso 121-sc03 possesses elemental abundance patterns different to those observed in other lmc globular clusters  just as pal .",
    "12 has been demonstrated to possess abundance ratios unlike galactic globular clusters or field stars , but in agreement with those observed for the sagittarius dsph @xcite .",
    "regarding the first characteristic , we note that @xcite measured a radial velocity of @xmath45 km@xmath46s@xmath47 for eso 121-sc03 . at a position angle ( measured north through east ) of @xmath48 @xcite and angular separation of @xmath49 from the lmc centre",
    ", this velocity fits very well with the observed carbon star kinematics and circularly - rotating disk model summarized by @xcite in their figure 5 .",
    "the observed velocity of eso 121-sc03 also fits well with the rotational velocities exhibited by other old outer lmc globular clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 6d ) .",
    "these results suggest that eso 121-sc03 may not be an accreted cluster , unless its parent building - block shared the kinematics characteristic of the outer regions of the lmc .",
    "even so , regarding the second and third points above , it would clearly be of significant interest to target the area surrounding eso 121-sc03 with deep wide - field imaging , in order to better survey the field star populations in this region",
    ". in would also be of great value to obtain high resolution spectral measurements with the aim of determining abundance ratios in this cluster .",
    "together such observations may offer important clues to the origin of eso 121-sc03 with strong implications for the formation and evolution of the lmc .",
    "this paper is based on observations made with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope , obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
