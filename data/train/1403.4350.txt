    "developing analytic tools capable of describing nonperturbative phenomena of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) remains an elusive goal . in this regard ,",
    "the gluon propagator is a nonperturbative quantity that is fundamental to qcd and has generated much interest .",
    "early investigations with the schwinger - dyson formalism worked in landau gauge and ignored the ghost contribution to the propagator .",
    "although this approximation clearly violates fundamental properties of qcd , it was regarded as numerically reliable .",
    "numerical and approximate solutions to the resulting gap equation yielded a propagator with a strong infrared enhancement , in keeping with simple expectations for qcd@xcite .    subsequently , it was realized that the ghost propagator can have an important influence on the schwinger - dyson equations and it was argued that the gluon and ghost propagators should behave as @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively in the infrared limit ( @xmath2 is positive and of order unity)@xcite . it was also noted that this expectation is in keeping with the confinement criterion of kugo and ojima@xcite , which requires an unbroken realization of brst symmetry ( namely the landau gauge ghost propagator should be more infrared singular than @xmath3@xcite )",
    ".    a great deal of effort has gone into improving schwinger - dyson computations of the two - point functions in the intervening sixteen years .",
    "this effort has focussed on a variety of topics including improvements to vertex models@xcite , inclusion of quarks and the derivation of chiral symmetry breaking@xcite , the extension to finite temperature@xcite , other gauges@xcite , a background field implementation@xcite , and investigations of various renormalization methods@xcite . at the same time",
    "great improvements have occurred in lattice gauge methodology ; this is of importance because it permits testing the effect of assumptions and truncations in the schwinger - dyson formalism .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations for the gluon are similar to those of abelian gauge theory with the addition of ghost and gluon loop contributions and two - loop contributions called the ` squint ' and ` sunset ' diagrams ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - gluon - gap ] ) .",
    "to date the two - loop diagrams have not been fully considered , in large part because of difficulties in renormalizing overlapping divergences@xcite . although perturbation theory indicates that the two - loop diagrams are suppressed in the ultraviolet region , it is useful to confirm this in the infrared limit",
    ". furthermore , until the two - loop contributions are obtained , it is impossible to disentangle the effects of vertex corrections from missing two - loop contributions .",
    "we have therefore undertaken the computation of the full suite of diagrams contributing to the two - point functions of qcd in a variety of vertex truncations .",
    "our results indicate that the two - loop terms do indeed make small contributions to the gluon propagator , with the squint diagram much larger than the sunset , and about 15% of the size of the gluon loop diagram .",
    "the computation employs a euclidean version of the momentum subtraction scheme for renormalization .",
    "unfortunately this means that quadratic divergences appear that must be removed .",
    "current methods rely on performing a projection of the gluon polarization tensor to eliminate terms proportional to the metric or numerical procedures to isolate terms that contribute to quadratic divergences . here",
    "we propose a different scheme based on standard renormalization methods that is simpler to implement .",
    "finally , we argue that vertex models that are often employed in the literature are not natural and examine the effects of alternate vertices .",
    "our results indicate that it is possible to get good agreement with lattice data and point the way to improvements in vertex modelling .",
    "we seek to obtain nonperturbative expressions for the gluon , ghost , and quark propagators .",
    "the results will be defined in terms of dressing functions as follows :    @xmath4    here @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the full quark , gluon , and ghost propagators .",
    "color indices have been suppressed in these expressions .",
    "bare propagators are obtained by setting @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we shall also refer to variant dressing functions :    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is interpreted as the dynamical quark mass and @xmath15 is the quark wavefunction .",
    "the dressing functions are obtained by solving the schwinger - dyson equations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig - gap ] and [ fig - gluon - gap ] .",
    "each diagram has one bare vertex or propagator , which is denoted with a cross ; all other quantities are dressed ; external lines are stubs",
    ".            it will be convenient to refer to the gluon polarization tensor @xmath16 .",

    "[ fig - gluon - gap ] as    ( d)^-1_(k ) = ( d_0)^-1_(k ) - i _ ( k ) .",
    "the gap equations require quark - gluon , ghost - gluon , three - gluon , and four - gluon vertices . in principle",
    "these can be obtained from lattice computations or higher order schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "although some progress in obtaining these vertices has been made@xcite , the current state of the art is to model vertices in terms of known functions or functionals of the dressing functions , with the aim of closing the system of schwinger - dyson equations .",
    "care must be exercised in modelling vertices since too much freedom will simply lead to a parameterization of lattice ( or other ) data .",
    "alternatively , imposing some expected behavior will often lead to vertices that are infinite as the cutoff is removed , and hence are not defined .",
    "the simplest model uses bare vertices ; this provides a useful starting point for the examination of nonperturbative phenomenology and can even be quantitatively accurate .",
    "for example , corrections to the ghost - gluon vertex are expected to be small@xcite .    in the case of abelian gauge theory ,",
    "the ward - takahashi identity can be used to completely constrain the longitudinal dependence of the full fermion - gauge boson vertex .",
    "the result is given in terms of the fermion dressing functions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and is called the ball - chiu vertex@xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the nonabelian case because the ghost dressing function and the quark - ghost scattering kernel , @xmath19 appear in the slavnov - taylor identity :    k__q^a ( p_1,p_2,k ) = i g t^a h(k ) [ s^-1(-p_1 ) k_g(p_1,p_2,k ) -     the resulting vertex has a rich structure that has been studied by fischer and others@xcite .",
    "an adequate approximation to the full longitudinal structure of the vertex can be obtained by neglecting the quark - gluon scattering kernel and multiplying the ball - chiu vertex by the ghost dressing function .",
    "we make the further simplification of retaining only the ` central ' term of the ball - chiu vertex ( called cbc below ) : _ q^a ( p_1,p_2,k ) = - i g t^a ^ h^n(p_1-p_2 ) [ a(p_1)+a(p_2 ) ] .",
    "[ qg - vertex ]    a well - known shortcoming of the ball - chiu approach is that the transverse part of the vertex function remains unspecified .",
    "this has been partly remedied in the abelian case by requiring multiplicative renormalizability in the asymptotic regime@xcite .",
    "no such ansatz exists for the nonabelian case and we choose to neglect this contribution henceforth .",
    "however , the correct perturbative asymptotic behavior for the quark propagator is not obtained with this approximation  presumably due to the missing transverse components of the vertex .",
    "it has been observed that supplying an extra power of the ghost propagator in eq .",
    "[ qg - vertex ] ( @xmath20 ) allows recovery of the expected asymptotic behavior@xcite .",
    "we therefore choose to allow for varying values of @xmath21 in the following .",
    "the ghost - gluon vertex has been considered by von smekal _",
    "et al._@xcite who neglect the ghost - ghost scattering contribution to the vertex and retain only the reducible part of the four - ghost scattering matrix element .",
    "the result is an ansatz of the form    ( q , p ) = g f^abc [ eqn - h ] where @xmath22 is the incoming ghost momentum , @xmath23 is the outgoing ghost momentum , @xmath24 is the incoming gluon momentum .",
    "the ghost dressing is of order unity and slowly varying , so this vertex is indeed close to the bare vertex , as stated above .",
    "finally , the bare four - gluon vertex is used in the following ; the bare three - gluon vertex is also used except for a brief exploration with a simple model that is discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations are renormalized by implementing a momentum subtraction scheme in euclidean space .",
    "this amounts to performing subtractions in integral equations that substitute renormalization factors for constraints ( the latter are analogous to observables such as pole location and propagator residue ) .",
    "although this procedure is ideal for numerical problems it generates quadratic divergences that do not occur with other regulators such as dimensional regularization .",
    "a common method to deal with quadratic divergences to date is to project terms proportional to the metric tensor out of the vacuum polarization with the ` brown - pennington ' projector@xcite .",
    "however this does not lead to satisfactory infrared behavior of the gluon dressing function@xcite , hence an alternative procedure that involves numerically isolating the quadratic divergence has also been used@xcite .    here",
    "we propose a simpler method that is based on standard renormalization .",
    "namely , a bare gluon mass term is included in the lagrangian ( the last term of eq .",
    "[ l0 ] ) .",
    "@xmath25    this may look unusual since modern treatments typically have gauge invariant bare lagrangians .",
    "however , this was a common procedure before the days of dimensional regularization@xcite .",
    "the philosophical stance is that it is only the symmetry properties of the renormalized theory that are relevant . in this case",
    "the gluon mass term simply absorbs a quadratic divergence in the vacuum polarization and hence gauge symmetry of the renormalized theory is guaranteed . with this approach",
    "the vacuum polarization is generalized to    i _",
    "+ i _ 1 p_p_where @xmath26 is a spurious form factor due to the regulator .",
    "this leads to a full gluon propagator :    i d_(k ) = - .",
    "[ eq - dd ] the dressing function @xmath27 of eq .",
    "[ eq - d ] involves the gauge non - invariant polarization scalar @xmath26",
    ". however both functions become moot in landau gauge , while @xmath28 is related to the standard vacuum polarization scalar    = p^_. [ eq - pi ] in this way the usual structure of the gluonic propagator is recovered , with the exception of an additional renormalization factor that can be used to absorb the quadratic divergence in @xmath29 .",
    "we stress that this method leads to different expressions than the brown - pennington method .",
    "specifically , the usual bp approach simply uses @xmath30 in place of @xmath29 .",
    "this expression does not have a quadratic divergence , as desired , but it has a different , and incorrect , subleading structure .",
    "in fact , the presence of quadratic divergences forces the existence of a new form factor proportional to @xmath31 and accounting for this changes the expression for the polarization scalar to agree with the conventional one of eq .",
    "[ eq - pi ] .",
    "the right hand sides of the gap equations contain divergences which must be renormalized .",
    "we thus introduce multiplicative renormalization factors in the traditional way , as shown in eq [ l0 ] . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", it is most convenient to renormalize the gap equations using a momentum subtraction scheme in euclidean space .",
    "a momentum space cutoff defined by a scale @xmath32 is introduced and a renormalization point denoted by @xmath33 ( we sometimes consider different renormalization scales for different quantities ) .",
    "the gap equations depend on the renormalization factors @xmath34 .",
    "these are removed with renormalization conditions and yield renormalized vertices and renormalized dressing functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "care must be exercised in renormalizing the gap equations since it is possible to make inconsistent renormalization choices that render the equations meaningless .",
    "furthermore , many vertex models that are in common use conflate modelling and renormalization , making it difficult to separate model - dependence from other assumptions .",
    "for example many practitioners choose to employ vertex models that depend on the cutoff ,    ^_q = z_f ( , ) ^. this cutoff dependence must be absorbed elsewhere in the gap equations and obfuscates the structure of both the vertices and the propagators .",
    "we propose to avoid these issues by working exclusively with renormalized quantities .",
    "as we shall see , this carries the price of making gauge noninvariance manifest .",
    "however , we argue that this is desirable since it reveals plainly the limitations induced by truncation , leads to consistent equations , and can be improved in a systematic ( and hopefully controlled ) fashion .",
    "the procedure involves writing bare schwinger - dyson equations and extracting appropriate renormalization factors .",
    "this yields equations of the form    @xmath39    where all dressing functions are renormalized and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 refer to renormalized quark - gluon , ghost - gluon , three - gluon , and four - gluon vertices . all tensor structure and factors of @xmath44",
    "have been suppressed .",
    "standard expressions relating renormalized and bare dressing functions have been used to obtain these equations .",
    "for example    s(p , ) = s_0(p , ) [ eq - s ] with s_0 = , while the one particle irreducible quark - gluon vertex obeys _ q^(s , t , u , ) = z_f ^_q0(s , t , u , ) .",
    "[ eq - g ]    thus the tree level quark - gluon vertex model is ^_tree = g_0 z_f ^with similar expression for the other vertices .",
    "vertex models ( or solutions to schwinger - dyson equations ) can be renormalized by fixing their strength at a kinematic point , @xmath45 : e.g. ,    _ q^(s_,t_,u _ ) = g_q^. thus g_0 z_f = g_q .",
    "[ g1 ] doing the same for the other vertices gives g_0 z_c = g_c , [ g2 ] g_0 z_a^3/2 = g_3 , [ g3 ] and g_0 z_a = g_4 .",
    "[ g4 ]    using tree level model vertices yields gap equations    @xmath46    finally , the field renormalization factors are identified by imposing renormalization conditions .",
    "for example setting the ghost dressing function to be @xmath47 at @xmath48 gives    z_c ( , ) = h^-1 ( ) + g_c^2^h g ( ) .",
    "[ zc ]    two subtractions are required to define the gluon propagator since the gluon loop integrals are quadratically divergent . a convenient choice for determining @xmath49 is at @xmath50 since the quadratic divergence is absorbed by @xmath51 ) and gauge invariance is retained .",
    "in contrast to this , the truncations implicit in eqs [ eq - renorm ] necessarily break gauge invariance .",
    "this can be seen in the lack of consistency eqs .",
    "[ g1 ]  [ g4 ] .",
    "for example , eq . [ g3 ] implies that @xmath52 which is not compatible with eq [ g4 ]",
    ". more generally , the four renormalization constants obtained as in eq . [ zc ] are inconsistent with eqs .",
    "[ g1 ]  [ g4 ] .",
    "this incompatibility must be due to the vertex model truncations and can not be resolved except by abandoning presumed gauge invariance . a simple way to achieve",
    "this is to employ different bare couplings    g_0 g_q 0 ,  g_c 0 ,  etc .",
    "presumably the lack of gauge invariance will be reflected in the values of the renormalized gauge couplings .",
    "furthermore , one expects that gauge couplings will converge to a common value as the accuracy of the schwinger - dyson truncation is improved .",
    "unfortunately this is difficult to quantify as the @xmath21-point truncation scheme is not tied to a small parameter .",
    "nevertheless , the premise of this approach to qcd is that the tree order schwinger - dyson equations provide a quantitatively useful approximation to two - point functions .",
    "this can be justified _ a posteriori _ if the predictions prove accurate or if full vertices are not heavily dressed .",
    "of course the implication is that increasingly accurate representations of qcd @xmath21-point functions yield more accurate propagators .",
    "for example , the schematic equation for the quark - gluon vertex ( in the bare quark - gluon vertex form ) reads    _ q = g_0 z_f ( + ssg _ q_q + sgg _ q _ 3 g + sg _ qqgg ) .",
    "this can be renormalized by setting @xmath53 to obtain @xmath54 .",
    "thus the vertex is determined along with one constraint on the renormalization factors .",
    "again , these equations can not be consistent if a model quark - quark - gluon - gluon vertex is employed , and different bare and renormalized couplings must again be used .",
    "however , it seems likely that the numerical difference between the renormalized couplings will be smaller , and will continue to get smaller as one marches up the @xmath21-point truncation of the schwinger - dyson equations and obtains results that obey the strictures of gauge symmetry to a greater degree .",
    "we will check this in the following by comparing tree level couplings to those obtained with the vertex models of section [ vm ] .      with renormalization in place",
    "we are ready to specify the gap equations .",
    "the quark gap equation is obtained by projecting the quark propagator onto its two components .",

    "our experience with the dynamical mass suggests that a good three - gluon vertex model will likely correct this problem .",
    "_ gluon _ squint _ sunset _ ghost _ quark .",
    "this does not agree with the results of von smekal _",
    "et al . _ and other groups , who find that the ghost loop dominates the gluon propagator .",
    "we suspect that this is due to the choice of three - gluon vertex model .",
    "for example , many authors use a model that has inverse powers of the gluon dressing function that strongly attenuates the contribution of the gluon propagator to the gluon loop polarization scalar ( in fact , some models eliminate it entirely ) .",
    "we have also not been able to reproduce the scaling solutions , where @xmath101 .",
    "again , this is likely due to model vertex choices .",
    "multiplicative renormalizability is often invoked while building vertex models .",
    "this is typically discussed in two ways : ( i ) vertex models are constructed in an attempt to mimic one - loop resummed perturbation theory or ( ii ) the restraints of the finite renormalization group are maintained with appropriate vertex choices . the usual application of the latter view is in requiring that the dynamical quark mass is a renormalization group invariant .",
    "it is possible to achieve this by using cutoff - dependent vertex models , but we have argued against this approach since it undermines renormalization .",
    "in fact , simply using the standard renormalization procedure of , e.g. , eqs .",
    "[ eq - s ] and [ eq - g ] in the quark gap equations guarantees that the dynamical mass is renormalization group invariant .",
    "this implies , once again , that model vertices should be renormalized .",
    "renormalization group invariance of the dynamical quark mass implies that it is independent of the renormalization scale , which implies that it is a function of the running coupling only .",
    "we have confirmed this by computing the dynamical mass for a variety of renormalization scales with results that match those of fig .",
    "[ fig - quark - lattice ] .    as a technical point",
    ", we have found that large grids are required to compute the two - loop diagrams accurately and that differentiable dressing functions are needed for subtractions to yield finite results in two - loop diagrams .    with consistent renormalization in place and",
    "all diagrams taken into account we are able to state that a model with a tree ghost - gluon vertex is likely adequate and enhancement is required in the quark - gluon vertex to obtain dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the correct asymptotic behavior of the dynamical quark mass .",
    "a similar enhancement is necessary in the three - gluon vertex , while little can be said about the four - gluon vertex at this point except that it likely does not affect the two - point functions strongly .",
    "further work incorporating lattice or schwinger - dyson models of the three - gluon vertex will be of use .",
    "extensions to finite temperature and other observables are also clearly of interest .",
    "finally , we remark that many schwinger - dyson approaches have been able to reproduce the main features of the nonperturbative propagators of qcd .",
    "evidently the simple vertex models and truncations typically used are capable of capturing the main features of the physics driving these quantities . that this is true is something of a mystery since no small parameter has been exploited to guarantee the success of this approach .",
    "perhaps one can conclude that two - point functions are relatively simple quantities .",
    "nevertheless , the apparent successes at this level can not be assumed to continue with higher @xmath21-point functions .",
    "for example , the diagrams that contribute to the quark - antiquark interaction can be topologically complicated and involve nonperturbative vertices at all orders .",
