    "it is generally assumed that the doppler shift arising from the solar motion is responsible for the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation dipole moment . allowing for solar motion with respect to the local group ( lg ) of galaxies , the cmb dipole ( lineweaver 1996 ) translates into a velocity @xmath3 of the lg with respect to the comoving reference frame , of amplitude @xmath4 , directed towards @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "most of the uncertainty arises from that on the motion of the sun with respect to the lg , which we assume to have an amplitude of 300 and directed towards @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( de vaucouleurs , de vaucouleurs & corwin 1976 ) .    in linear theory , the peculiar velocity induced on the lg by the inhomogeneities present within a sphere of radius @xmath9 is _ pec , lg(r ) = h__^0.64 _ mass(*r * ) * r*r^3 w(r , r ) d^3*r * where @xmath10 is a window function of width @xmath9 , @xmath11 is the distance in , @xmath12 is the mass overdensity at * r * and @xmath13 is the cosmological density parameter . assuming that the cmb dipole is the result of a doppler shift , then there must be identity between @xmath3 and @xmath14 as @xmath15 . as @xmath9 increases",
    ", @xmath14 converges towards @xmath3 if the average value of @xmath12 within a shell of radius @xmath9 approaches zero . in a universe which on large scales is homogeneous ,",
    "it is thus reasonable to expect that the _ reflex _ motion of the lg , with respect to the contents of a shell of large enough radius @xmath9 , will exhibit a dipole that closely matches that of the cmb radiation field .",
    "how large should @xmath9 be , for that convergence to be observed ? the issue is widely debated , and positions can roughly be divided  with much grey area in between  between two main camps : one in which the vast majority of the local dynamics is determined by mass fluctuations within @xmath16 510,000 , and one in which a very substantial fraction of that motion arises outside @xmath17 .",
    "the latter is substantiated by several studies , from the early suggestion of scaramella ( 1989 ) on the importance of the shapley supercluster to the results of lauer & postman ( 1994 ) , based on the reference frame defined by 119 abell clusters within roughly @xmath18 15,000 .",
    "lauer & postman found the reflex motion of the lg with respect to the cluster sample to be given by a vector @xmath19 of amplitude @xmath20 , directed towards @xmath21 .",
    "the lack of coincidence between @xmath19 and @xmath3 implies an overall bulk flow of the lauer & postman cluster reference frame of @xmath22 towards @xmath23 .",
    "this result was confirmed by a re  analysis of the lauer & postman data by colless ( 1995 ) , but was found in conflict with the studies of riess ( 1995 ) and giovanelli ( 1996 ) .",
    "here we analyze the dipole signatures of the peculiar velocity field of the sfi sample of field spirals .",
    "the characteristics of the sample are briefly described in section 2 ; for further details , see giovanelli ( 1994 ) and the data presentation in haynes ( 1998a , b ) . in section 3",
    "we present the results of the dipole fits and discuss their amplitudes and significance in connection with the issue of the convergence depth of the local universe .",
    "the sfi sample was selected by adopting strict angular size limits for the target galaxies , which varied with redshift in order not to underpopulate more distant shells ( see giovanelli 1994 ) .",
    "galaxies observed by our team north of @xmath24 were combined with data obtained by mathewson , ford & buckhorn ( 1992 ) ; the combined sample was severely trimmed in order to obtain a homogeneous all  sky sample of 1289 _ field _ objects , extending to @xmath25 . this sample ( sfi )",
    "is complemented by several hundred additional objects , which extends to higher redshifts with lesser degree of completeness . this extended sample , which has no significant sky coverage bias but rapidly decreasing completeness to @xmath26 , will be referred to as ` sfi@xmath27 ' .",
    "these two field samples are completely independent on the sample of cluster galaxies ( sci ) , presented in giovanelli ( 1997a , b ) .",
    "a study of the sci dipoles is presented in a complementary paper ( giovanelli 1998 ) .",
    "the sfi and sfi@xmath27 samples are dense enough to allow estimates of dipoles for separate volume shells , centered on the lg .",
    "however , the windowing of such shells can introduce bias in the results .",
    "such bias can be avoided if ( a ) the selection is done by observed redshift @xmath28 , when the _ inverse _ tf relation is used to estimate peculiar velocities , or if ( b ) the selection is done by tf distance @xmath29 , when the _ direct _ tf relation is used ( for details see freudling 1995 ) . in case ( b ) , however , it is necessary to correct the derived peculiar velocities for the so  called `` inhomogeneous malmquist bias '' ( imb ) . we have computed the imb at the location of each sample galaxy by estimating locally the gradient of the density field , as obtained from a redshift catalog ( see freudling 1994 for details ) .",
    "such a catalog yields imb corrections of quality that decreases rapidly with distance . for the sfi@xmath27 sample , which is deeper than the strict sfi , imb s are not available , and",
    "the dipole calculations are carried out only with peculiar velocities obtained using the inverse tf approach .",
    "since we are interested in the comparison with @xmath3 , @xmath19 and other dipole determinations , we shall estimate the dipole of the _ reflex _ motion of the lg with respect to our cluster set .",
    "if @xmath30 is the peculiar velocity of the @xmath31th galaxy in the sample , and @xmath32 is the uncertainty on that quantity , we solve for the vector @xmath33 of the dipole moment by minimizing the merit function ^2 = _",
    "i w_i ( v_i - * v*_d _ i_i)^2 where @xmath34 is the unit vector in the direction of the @xmath31th galaxy and @xmath35 is a weight .",
    "@xmath32 is obtained from the tf scatter function we have obtained for the well  determined tf template relation of cluster galaxies ( giovanelli 1997b ) , which varies with velocity width @xmath36 as : @xmath37 mag .",
    "our adoption is justified because the @xmath32 obtained for cluster galaxies is not affected by the cluster motions , which had been corrected for before the tf scatter function was estimated .",
    "such correction is much more difficult for field galaxies , as it would require precise knowledge , point by point , of the unsmoothed peculiar velocity field .",
    "as shown by giovanelli ( 1997b ) , there is no dependence of the scatter amplitude on the distance of the galaxy from cluster centers : we thus feel justified in adopting the cluster galaxy scatter function for the field galaxies .",
    "the weights @xmath35 are intended to provide a correction that accounts for the fading selection function of the sample with increasing distance . for computations of dipoles of galaxies within shells ,",
    "the application of a weight @xmath35 is of limited impact .",
    "however , in the calculation of the dipole and bulk flow of the field over volumes including a large range in distances , the application of weights is necessary in order to obtain an estimate which is independent on the particular selection function of the sample .",
    "the global motion of a volume bound by a top hat window can be approximated by using weights which are proportional to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the distance to the @xmath40th nearest neighbor to galaxy @xmath31 in the sample ; @xmath40 is a number usually chosen between 3 and 9 .",
    "we have computed such weights for @xmath41 , which matches the estimated accuracy of the approach with computational ease .",
    "table 1 lists the amplitude and apex galactic coordinates of sfi dipoles , computed for a variety of cases and subsamples .",
    "the calculations are carried out with @xmath42 s obtained using the inverse tf relation ( solutions 113 ) and with imb  corrected @xmath42 s obtained using the direct tf relation ( solutions 1419 ) .",
    "the latter are only computed for the sfi sample for the reason given in section 2 .",
    "the former are computed for both the sfi ( odd  numbered solutions 111 ) and for the sfi@xmath27 samples ( even  numbered solutions 212 and 13 ) , as indicated in col .",
    "uncertainties on the dipole parameters are not estimated from the formal errors of the fit , but rather from a replacement bootstrap procedure , whereby 500 synthetic data sets are used , each with 63% of the objects randomly chosen among those in the original data set and the remaining 37% of the entries being duplicated ones .",
    "dipole amplitudes are corrected by the `` error bias '' discussed by lauer & postman , which in our case is of moderate or negligible importance on the results .",
    "each line of table 1 gives the dipole solution for a subset of the data , windowed in @xmath28 ( for the inverse tf ) or in @xmath43 ( for the direct tf ) as indicated .",
    "for the global solutions ( 1 , 2 and 14 ) we give separately the dipole parameters estimated for @xmath44\\equiv 1 $ ] ( solutions labelled ` a ' ) and for equal volume weights as described above ( solutions labelled ` b ' ) ; the other solutions are averages of the two cases , albeit the differences between the two averaged values are usually quite small and well within the uncertainties of each determination .",
    "the number of galaxies used in each solution ( listed in column 2 ) differs between the direct and inverse solutions for a given shell , as the windowing is carried out for different variables ( @xmath43 and @xmath28 , respectively ) . a small fraction of objects ( @xmath45 12% ) with large ( @xmath46 mag ) , possibly spurious magnitude offsets from the adopted tf relations were excluded in the calculations of dipole parameters .",

    "the horizontal dashed line is the 611 amplitude of the cmb dipole .",
    "panel 1(b ) shows the apices of the dipole solutions , plotted in galactic coordinates .",
    "the large , crossed circle identifies the cmb dipole and the large square is the apex of the lg motion with respect to the abell cluster sample reported by lauer & postman .    the reflex motion of the lg with respect to field galaxies within 2000 exhibits a relatively small amplitude and appears directed towards high galactic latitude .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectation that such motion is largely affected by the presence of the density enhancement represented by the local supercluster , centered on the virgo cluster ( m87 is at @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) . as the radius of the shell increases , however , the lg reflex motion asymptotically approaches @xmath3 , both in amplitude and apex direction . within the uncertainty of the measurement ,",
    "the two quantities become indistinguishable at distances larger than @xmath1 .",
    "this result is consistent with the determination obtained with a completely independent cluster data set by giovanelli ( 1998 ) , and excludes with a high degree of confidence ( @xmath50% ) the possibility that the lg may exhibit a dipole such as reported by lauer & postman , with respect to the contents of any shell within a distance of 8000 .",
    "the dipoles of the global samples ( 1 , 2 and 14 ) depart from the cmb dipole at a significant level .",
    "the equal  volume  weighted solutions ( labelled ` b ' ) are noisier than those obtained with @xmath44 \\equiv 1 $ ] , an expected result as the former give higher weight to more distant objects and errors in the peculiar velocity rise linearly with distance . the difference @xmath51 for any of the solutions in table 1 yields the bulk flow motion of the corresponding sample with respect to the cmb . because many of the dipole solutions match so closely the cmb dipole , resulting bulk flows are quite modest , and their directions largely unconstrained .",
    "bulk flows associated with solutions 1b , 2b and 14b give an estimate of the motion , filtered by a top hat function , of the local universe within 6500 .",
    "the average of those three solutions is 200@xmath52 towards @xmath53 .",
    "this is in general agreement with the direction of bulk flows reported in other studies ( da costa 1996 ; courteau 1993 ; dekel 1994 ) , but it is smaller than other determinations , which range between 270 and 400 .",
    "it agrees well in amplitude and direction with the bulk motion with respect to clusters of galaxies within 9000 and with measured tf distances ( giovanelli 1998 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the bulk flows associated with solutions 1a , 2a and 14a are somewhat larger , approaching 300 amplitude in the case of solution 1a .",
    "these solutions do however weigh heavily nearby galaxies and the bulk flow solutions are representative of a significantly smaller effective volume than those for cases 1b , 2b and 14b .    in summary , we obtain that the reflex peculiar motion of the lg with respect to field spiral galaxies approaches convergence with the cmb dipole within 6500 .",
    "the dipole moment of the lg motion with respect to the outer shells of that volume agrees with the cmb dipole within the uncertainties .",
    "the motion of the lg with respect to spirals within 2000 is consistent with it being influenced by the mass excess represented by the local supercluster .",
    "it can be excluded to a high degree of confidence that the lg motion may exhibit a dipole as that reported by lauer & postman , with respect to the contents of any shell within a distance of 8000 . finally , the bulk flow with respect to the cmb reference frame of a sphere of 6500 radius , bound by a top hat window , is @xmath54 , directed towards @xmath53 .",
