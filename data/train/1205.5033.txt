    "the presence of a central massive object in the nuclei of galaxies appears to be a generic by - product of their formation and evolution . over the last decade ,",
    "it has become clear that in galaxies with massive stellar spheroids ( i.e. massive ellipticals or early - type spirals with bulges more massive than @xmath8 ) , the nucleus is nearly always occupied by a super - massive black hole that outweighs by far the stellar mass within the central few parsecs . on the other hand , in most galaxies _ without _ massive stellar spheroids , such as disk - dominated spirals and low - mass ellipticals , an smbh is only rarely present @xcite . instead , the central mass concentration is dominated by a compact and massive nuclear star cluster . in between the two regimes",
    ", there appears to be a `` transitional '' spheroid mass range ( @xmath9 ) \\lesssim\\,10 $ ] ) over which the two cmo types can co - exist , and have comparable masses @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear , however , whether these two incarnations of cmos form through different physics , or are merely different evolutionary stages of a common formation mechanism .",
    "this question has triggered a very active area of astrophysical research , with many observational studies of the statistics and properties of nscs @xcite and smbhs @xcite in low - mass spheroids , their co - existence @xcite , as well as a number of proposed theories about the growth of nscs @xcite and the mutual feedback between nsc and smbh @xcite .    in 2006 ,",
    "three independent studies @xcite pointed out that nsc masses appear to correlate with the masses of their host spheroids , confirming an earlier result by @xcite .",
    "these scaling relations are similar to those observed for smbhs @xcite , i.e. @xmath10 . however , because of the observational difficulties to obtain reliable nsc masses , and the relatively small range of spheroid masses over which nscs dominate over smbhs , it is still debated whether both types of cmos follow the same scaling relation ( i.e. have the same value of @xmath11 ) , or whether they depend in different ways on the properties of their host spheroid .    while @xcite suggested that nscs smoothly extend the smbh relations to lower masses , with @xmath12 in both cases , a recent study by @xcite concluded that the two types of cmos depend differently on the _ total _ spheroid mass : nscs follow a relation with @xmath13 while for smbhs , @xmath14 .    in order to add to the current discussion , we re - examine photometry of the stellar spheroids and nscs in 51 early - type galaxies , obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "acs virgo cluster survey , and published in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xcite compared the _ luminous _ mass of 29 nscs to the _ total _ mass of their host galaxies , the latter being estimated from stellar velocity dispersion measurements . here ,",
    "we follow a somewhat different approach by comparing the _ luminous _ mass of _ both _ nsc and galaxy spheroids , derived via color - corrected mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this not only yields more reliable stellar masses , but also improves the statistics by increasing our sample size to 51 since we can use nearly the entire sample of nscs identified in @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in   [ sec : data ] , we summarize the data sources for our analysis and describe our method to convert the published photometry into estimates of the stellar mass of both nscs and host spheroids",
    ". we present a quantitative analysis of the resulting @xmath15 relation in ",
    "[ sec : corr ] , as well as of the inferred @xmath0 relation .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate through a multi - variate analysis that the only statistically significant correlation with any observed parameter is a simple linear scaling of nsc mass with spheroid mass . in   [ sec : predict ] , we briefly summarize the theoretical predictions for two models of nsc formation , compare the present - day nsc masses to those predictions , and discuss the implications for the plausibility of either model .",
    "we conclude with a discussion and summary of our results and the implications for the origin of nscs in   [ discussion ] and   [ summary ] , respectively .",
    "for our analysis , we use data for 51 nucleated early - type galaxies observed during the _ advanced camera for surveys _ virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs , * ? ? ? * ) . taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ ,",
    "this data set provides detailed and accurate photometry for both the galaxy bodies and their nscs .",
    "we reject five galaxies from the original sample of @xcite in which the apparent nscs are significantly offset from the galaxy s photocentre and therefore , as discussed by @xcite , may well be globular clusters that only appear to reside close to the nucleus due to a chance projection .",
    "we note here that , given the morphological types of the sample galaxies ( e , s0 , de , ds0 , and de , n ) , their stellar spheroids can be expected to be virialized , and to have little or no current star formation activity .",
    "this justifies use of a single ( color - dependent ) mass - to - light ratio for each galaxy spheroid in order to derive its stellar mass .",
    "we make use of the apparent z - band magnitudes , ( g - z ) colors , and half - light radii for both nscs ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and host spheroids ( from * ? ? ?",
    "in order to convert to absolute magnitudes and physical radii , we follow the approach of @xcite and assume a common distance of 16.5mpc for all galaxies . for convenience , the observed galaxy and nsc magnitudes are listed again in columns 2 and 3 of table  [ table : properties ] .",
    "we also list in column  4 the ( completeness - corrected ) total number of globular clusters ( gcs ) as provided in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their table 2 ) which we will use in   [ subsec : infall ] .    in order to obtain estimates for the stellar masses of both nscs and spheroids ,",
    "we need to multiply their respective z - band luminosities by an appropriate mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we use the empirically calibrated mass - to - light ratios provided by @xcite , accounting for the ( g - z ) color of nsc and spheroid , respectively , and list the resulting values for @xmath5 and @xmath1 in columns 5 and 8 of table  [ table : properties ] .",
    "we also provide estimates for the average gc mass @xmath16 for our sample of galaxies .",
    "this is done by multiplying the z - band galaxy masses by the percentage of the total mass of the galaxy in gcs ( obtained in the z - band ) taken from @xcite .",
    "this gives an estimate for the total mass of the gc system , which we then divide by the total number of gcs in order to arrive at an estimate for the average gc mass .",
    "note that some of the percentages provided in @xcite are negative .",
    "in these few cases , we leave blank the corresponding entry for @xmath16 in table  [ table : properties ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : bestfit - nc ]",
    "in this section , we compare theoretical predictions for nsc masses from two popular formation models to the observational data .",
    "we begin by deriving theoretical relations for each formation scenario , which we use as a basis for comparison with observational data .      a plausible mechanism for the birth of `` seed '' nscs , proposed by @xcite , is an extension of the arguments presented in @xcite and @xcite for the @xmath17-@xmath18 relation .",
    "it involves the formation of a massive star cluster from gas accumulating at the center during the early phases of the galaxy s evolution .",
    "very soon after the onset of star formation , stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae drive a superwind from the nucleus .",
    "initially , the wind is momentum - conserving with a momentum flux that is proportional to the eddington luminosity .",
    "it sweeps up the surrounding medium into a thin supershell that gets pushed outward by the ram pressure it generates .",
    "eventually , gravity balances the ram pressure and the shell stalls .",
    "more gas then falls into and feeds the nucleus .",
    "the process is repeated until the nsc reaches a critical mass , at which point the stall radius becomes very large ( since the stall radius is proportional to the mass of the nsc ) .",
    "this gives the gas time to cool before it can reach the stall radius , since the cooling time begins to exceed the crossing time of the bubble .",
    "the gas becomes energy - conserving , and accelerates in its expansion to escape from the galaxy .",
    "this fixes the mass of the nsc at the critical mass @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 again is the baryonic mass fraction , @xmath21 @xmath22 g@xmath23 is the electron scattering opacity , and @xmath18 is the velocity dispersion of the spheroid .",
    "if correct , this mechanism would therefore naturally explain the @xmath24 dependence suggested by @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose a value of @xmath25 for the efficiency of massive - star feedback from a young nuclear cluster .",
    "this is based on simple calculations for the contributions from both supernovae and stellar winds to the total momentum flux , and agrees with more detailed calculations of @xcite for the total momentum deposition from solar - metallicity stars",
    ".    we can re - write equation  [ eqn : m_crit ] using the virial theorem .",
    "this assumes that the present - day mass distribution of the galaxy is representative of its distribution at the time of nsc formation .",
    "in particular , if the nsc formed before the galaxy mass was fully assembled , the velocity dispersion of the surrounding spheroid may well have been lower than it is today .    substituting the virial relation given by equation  [ eqn : virial ] into equation  [ eqn : m_crit ] , this predicts for the nsc mass : @xmath26 re - writing this in a more convenient form : @xmath27 where we have assumed the baryonic mass fraction @xmath20 , and the electron scattering opacity @xmath21 @xmath22 g@xmath23 .",
    "the second nsc formation scenario occurs via the successive mergers of globular clusters ( gcs ) that spiral into the galactic centre due to dynamical friction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using n - body simulations of merging gcs in galaxy nuclei , several studies have successfully reproduced some of the properties of nscs , including their small effective radii and central velocity dispersions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in general , the time required for a gc of mass @xmath28 that starts on a circular orbit with radius @xmath29 from the galactic centre to spiral into the nucleus is given by @xcite : @xmath30 } & = & \\frac{1.65}{g\\ln{\\lambda}}\\frac{r^2{\\sigma}}{m_{\\rm gc } } \\\\             & = & \\frac{3.73 \\times 10^{11}}{\\ln{\\lambda}}\\big ( \\frac{r}{2{\\>{\\rm kpc } } } \\big)^2 \\big ( \\frac{\\sigma}{250 { \\>{\\rm km}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1 } } } \\big ) \\big ( \\frac{10 ^ 6 { \\>{\\rm m_{\\odot}}}}{m_{\\rm gc } } \\big ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy .",
    "the coulomb logarithm is denoted by @xmath31 , and is on the order of 10 @xcite . according to equation  [ eqn : tdyn ] , dynamical friction operates most efficiently on the most massive gcs .",
    "if the nsc was indeed built from gcs that have sunk into the nucleus , its mass should follow a relation of the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total mass of the globular cluster system , @xmath34 is the total number of gcs , @xmath16 is the _ present - day _ average gc mass of the galaxy ( column11 of table[table : properties ] ) , and @xmath35 is the mass fraction of the gc system that has merged onto the nsc",
    ".    this mass fraction should be proportional to the ratio of the age of the galaxy , @xmath36 , to the time for an average gc to fall into the core due to dynamical friction , @xmath37 : @xmath38 here , the additional constant @xmath39 accounts for the fact that only gcs that are located within a radius at which @xmath40 will have had enough time to have fallen into the nsc via dynamical friction .",
    "substituting @xmath41 in equation[eqn : tdyn ] shows that for most galaxies in our sample , only gcs well inside the half - light radius @xmath6 can be expected to have fallen into the nucleus .",
    "however , the present - day orbits of most gcs in our sample are comparable to or exceed the half - light radius in their host galaxies @xcite . in other words ,",
    "most gcs will not have had sufficient time to have spiraled into the nucleus , i.e. @xmath42 . the compilation of @xcite can be used to estimate the present - day value of @xmath39 by calculating the fraction of gcs inside @xmath6 .",
    "this yields @xmath43 , in reasonable agreement with the notion that @xmath34 has not changed significantly over the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "we assume a universal initial gc mf that adheres to the same radial dependence in all galaxies , and use the dynamical friction timescale calculated at the half - light radius as a proxy for the corresponding volume - integrated value .",
    "using equation  [ eqn : tdyn ] , we get from equation  [ eqn : m_nc_2b1 ] : @xmath44 where we have used the half - light radius of the galaxy @xmath6 as a proxy for the average initial orbital radius from which clusters begin spiraling into the nucleus .    using the virial theorem to substitute for @xmath18 ( equation  [ eqn : virial ] ) , and @xmath45 then yields @xmath46 alternatively , we can re - write equation  [ eqn : m_nc_2b3 ] in the more convenient form : @xmath47 where we have assumed a galaxy age of 10 gyrs , @xmath20 , and @xmath48 .",
    "we proceed to compare the predictions of the two formation scenarios discussed in the previous sections to the observed nsc masses , @xmath49 .    for the in - situ star formation model , the predicted nsc masses , @xmath50 , as calculated from equation  [ eqn : m_nc_1 ] )",
    "are plotted against the observations in figure  [ fig : obs_vs_pred_sf ] .",
    "a weighted least - squares fit yields the relation @xmath51 the correlation is rather strong ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , and has a scatter of 0.54 dex .",
    "however , the offset between the observed and predicted values suggests that the in - situ formation model _ over - predicts _ the observations by roughly _ two orders of magnitude _ across the galaxy sample . given that secular evolution processes such as additional infall of cold molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or young star clusters may well have added to the observed present - day nsc masses , and that all mechanisms for mass loss , such as the ejection of stars due to dynamical encounters , appear negligible in nscs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this appears to present a severe challenge for the @xcite model .",
    "figure  [ fig : obs_vs_pred_gc ] makes the corresponding comparison for the gc infall model . here",
    ", the predicted nsc masses were calculated using equation  [ eqn : m_nc_2b3 ] .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig : obs_vs_pred_gc ] is the best fit linear relation between the two quantities , described by @xmath54 the best - fit correlation has a slope that is marginally consistent with zero , has a large scatter of 0.80 dex , and is statistically weak ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "moreover , the y - intercept suggests that the gc infall model _ under - predicts _ the observed nsc masses by about an order of magnitude across the galaxy sample . adding to this problem",
    "is the fact that , as pointed out by @xcite , many gcs may be disrupted before reaching the nucleus , which would result in an even smaller nsc mass .",
    "we conclude that the gc infall model provides a poor description of the observations .    .",
    "the solid line shows a weighted least - squares fit to the data according to equation[eqn : wlsq_sf ] .",
    "error bars are described as in figure  [ fig : mmcorr ] .",
    "[ fig : obs_vs_pred_sf ] ]    .",

    "error bars are described as in figure  [ fig : mmcorr ] .",
    "[ fig : obs_vs_pred_gc ] ]    the multi - variate analysis presented in ",
    "[ subsec : multivar ] offers an additional test of the in situ star formation and gc infall models .",
    "in particular , from equation  [ eqn : m_nc_1 ] , the in situ star formation model predicts @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , whereas , from equation  [ eqn : m_nc_2b3 ] , the gc infall model predicts @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , if the various combinations of these values for @xmath63 , @xmath11 , and @xmath64 for one of our competing formation scenarios are found to lie within the joint confidence intervals in every 2-dimensional projection of this 3-dimensional parameter space , this could be interpreted as evidence that the data are consistent with that particular formation scenario .",
    "the 1@xmath18 and 2@xmath18 joint confidence intervals for all three projections of our 3-dimensional parameter space are shown in figure  [ fig : contours - nc ] .",
    "the theoretically predicted relations are shown by solid triangles and circles for the in situ star formation and gc infall models , respectively , as described in the figure caption .",
    "the precise values for the power - law indices corresponding to both the in situ and gc infall models do not coincide with even the 2@xmath18 confidence intervals in any of the three projections .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath1 scales linearly with luminous spheroid mass @xmath5 .",
    "we also find a dependence of the form @xmath65 when using velocity dispersions estimated via the virial theorem .",
    "this appears to support the conclusion of @xcite that the observed @xmath66 relation is _ not _ an extension of the observed @xmath67 relation .",
    "our results thus add further evidence to the notion that nscs and smbhs may not share a common origin , and that , instead , different formation mechanisms may be responsible for the two incarnations of a central massive object .",
    "we note that we find a slightly stronger correlation for the @xmath68 relation than we do for the @xmath69 relation .",
    "this raises the question whether perhaps a more fundamental relation is that between the velocity dispersion of the host spheroid and that of the nsc .",
    "such a relation could be explained if the nscs are in thermal equilibrium with their host spheroids , possibly because galaxies tend to evolve towards ( or be born in ) such a state . to test this",
    ", we again used the virial theorem to calculate velocity dispersions also for all nscs in the galaxy sample , using their effective radii measured by @xcite , and listed in column9 of table  [ table : properties ] .",
    "figure[fig : sigsig ] shows that both quantities are indeed correlated , with a linear fit yielding @xmath70 the correlation is rather strong ( @xmath71 ) , and has a smaller scatter ( 0.24dex ) around the best linear fit than either the @xmath69 or the @xmath68 relation .",
    "this supports the idea that the the dynamical evolution of nscs is significantly affected by heat input from the surrounding galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if indeed the present - day nscs have reached an energy balance with their host spheroids , it implies that the time - scale for energy exchange between them is short compared to the age of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that the present - day properties of nscs do not necessarily reflect those at the time of their formation , since there was ample time for them to be modified by the presence of the surrounding spheroid .    .",
    "error bars were calculated using the 0.041 mag and 0.007 arcsecond uncertainties quoted by @xcite for the nsc apparent magnitudes and radii , respectively .",
    "[ fig : sigsig ] ]    the masses we have used for our analysis are derived from photometry , and therefore measure only the stellar mass of the galaxy . measured velocity dispersions , on the other hand , provide a better proxy for the total mass of the spheroid , including the dark matter halo .",
    "it would therefore be most useful to perform a similar analysis using measured velocity dispersions once they become available . nevertheless ,",
    "because of the arguments presented in section  [ subsec : multivar ] , our results have cast some doubt on the assumption that the baryonic mass fraction @xmath72 is the same for all early - type galaxies and/or that the dark matter has the same radial profile as the luminous matter .",
    "we have also compared the observed present - day nsc masses to theoretical predictions from two proposed models for nsc formation , namely in - situ star formation regulated by momentum feedback and the successive infall of star clusters due to dynamical friction . as discussed in  [ subsec : comparison ] , both models appear to have difficulties in predicting the observations .",
    "the in - situ model predicts nsc masses that exceed the observed ones by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "since the nsc may well have grown through secular processes throughout the life of the galaxy , this is probably only a lower limit for the true difference .",
    "the discrepancy may be somewhat reduced if one assumes that the host galaxy was significantly less massive and/or more extended at the time of nsc formation than it is today . in this case ,",
    "equation  [ eqn : m_nc_1 ] would yield lower nsc masses .",
    "for example , if the nsc host was half as massive and twice as extended when the nsc formed , the resulting nsc mass should be @xmath73 times lower .",
    "on the other hand , in this scenario it is difficult to explain why the @xmath0 relation does not seem to have the predicted slope of @xmath74 @xcite .    the gc infall model , on the other hand , systematically under - predicts the observed nsc masses by about an order of magnitude across the galaxy sample .",
    "this could , at least partly , be rectified by adopting a larger value for the average gc mass .",
    "indeed , the most massive gcs are most responsive to dynamical friction , and therefore are most likely to have spiraled into the nucleus by today . using the present - day average gc mass as an estimate for the average mass of the gcs that have merged onto the nsc in equation  [ eqn : m_nc_2b3 ] may therefore provide too low an estimate . indeed , most nsc masses can be reproduced if  10 very massive gcs ( @xmath75 ) had fallen in via dynamical friction . with the data at hand ,",
    "we can not rule out this possibility .    in summary ,",
    "both models appear to have difficulties in explaining the observed nsc masses .",
    "of course , this does not imply that neither in - situ star formation nor gc infall has occurred , but it suggests that either model by itself provides an over - simplified description of nsc formation .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a statistical analysis to study the observed @xmath15 and inferred @xmath66 relations using a large sample of 51 nucleated early - type galaxies taken from the acsvcs .",
    "we used _ luminous _",
    "galaxy masses , and calculated velocity dispersions found by assuming virial equilibrium applies for our sample of galaxies .",
    "we confirm a linear relationship between nsc mass and luminous host spheroid mass reported by previous studies , but infer a shallower slope of the @xmath0 relation than reported in @xcite .",
    "our results support a recent claim @xcite that nscs do not obey the same @xmath76 relation as do smbhs , adhering instead to a shallower dependence .",
    "specifically , we found @xmath65 .",
    "this appears to cast doubt on the notion that nscs and smbhs share a common evolutionary path , i.e. that they are merely different incarnations of `` central massive object '' .",
    "we speculate that the discrepancy between our results and those of @xcite , who found an @xmath66 relation closer to @xmath24 using _ observed _ velocity dispersions , can perhaps be explained if the baryonic mass fraction is not the same for all early - type galaxies , or follows a different radial profile than the luminous matter .",
    "finally , we have compared the observed present - day nsc masses to first - order predictions of two proposed nsc formation scenarios , namely gc infall and feedback - regulated in - situ formation .",
    "we find that neither scenario can provide a reasonable agreement with the observations .",
    "we would like to thank elizabeth wehner for useful suggestions that improved the quality of our paper , and laura ferrarese for helpful discussions regarding the measured velocity dispersion of the acsvcs galaxies .",

    "<S> we combine published photometry for the nuclear star clusters and stellar spheroids of 51 low - mass , early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with empirical mass - to - light ratios , in order to complement previous studies that explore the dependence of nuclear star cluster ( nsc ) masses on various properties of their host galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm a roughly linear relationship between nsc mass and luminous host spheroid mass , albeit with considerable scatter ( 0.57 dex ) . in order to translate this to an @xmath0 relation , we estimate velocity dispersions from the virial theorem , assuming all galaxies in our sample share a common dark matter fraction and are dynamically relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> we then find that @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 , with a slightly reduced scatter of 0.54 dex .    </S>",
    "<S> this confirms recent results that the shape of the @xmath4 relation is different for nscs and super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this result in the context of the generalized idea of `` central massive objects '' ( cmos ) .    in order to assess which physical parameters drive the observed nuclear cluster masses , </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out a joint multi - variate power - law fit to the data . in this , we allow the nuclear cluster mass to depend on spheroid mass and radius ( and hence implicitly on velocity dispersion ) , as well as on the size of the globular cluster reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> when considered together , the dependences on @xmath5 and @xmath6 are roughly consistent with the virial theorem , and therefore @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> . however , the only statistically significant correlation appears to be a simple linear scaling between nsc mass and luminous spheroid mass .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed to directly compare the derived nsc masses with predictions for two popular models for nsc formation , namely i ) globular cluster infall due to dynamical friction , and </S>",
    "<S> ii ) in - situ formation during the early phases of galaxy formation that is regulated via momentum feedback from stellar winds and/or supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> neither model can directly predict the observations , and we discuss possible interpretations of our findings .    </S>",
