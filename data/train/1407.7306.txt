    "an unexpected discovery at rhic / bnl in @xmath6 reactions at @xmath7  agev  @xcite and at lhc / cern in @xmath8  atev @xmath2 reactions  @xcite is the large magnitude of mid - rapidity azimuthal anisotropy moments , @xmath9 , that are remarkably similar to those observed previously in non - central @xmath10  @xciteand in @xmath3  @xcite reactions .",
    "see especially the preliminary atlas results in fig .",
    "24 of ref .",
    "@xcite and the qm14 atlas talk by j. jia in these proceedings  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the beam energy scan ( bes ) at rhic  @xcite revealed a near @xmath11 independence from 8  agev to 2.76  atev of @xmath12 in @xmath5 at fixed centrality that was also unexpected .    in high energy @xmath5 ,",
    "the systematics of @xmath13 data have been interpreted as possible evidence for the near `` perfect fluidity '' of the strongly - coupled quark gluon plasmas ( sqgp ) produced in such reactions  @xcite .",
    "however , the recent observation of similar @xmath14 arising from much smaller transverse size @xmath15 systems and also the near beam energy independence of the moments observed in the beam energy scan ( bes )  @xcite from 7.7  agev to 2.76  atev in @xmath5 have posed a problem for the perfect fluid interpretation because near inviscid hydrodynamics is not expected to apply in space - time regions where the local temperature field falls below the confinement temperature , @xmath16  mev . in that hadron resonance gas",
    "( hrg ) `` corona '' region , the viscosity to entropy ratio is predicted to grow rapidly with decreasing temperature  @xcite and the corona volume fraction must increase and the volume of the perfect fluid `` core '' with @xmath17 must decrease when either the projectile atomic number @xmath18 decreases or the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath11 decreases .    while hydrodynamic equations have been shown to be _ sufficient _ to describe @xmath15 data with particular assumptions about initial and freeze - out boundary conditions  @xcite , its _ necessity _ as a unique interpretation of the data is not guaranteed .",
    "this point was underlined recently using a specific initial - state saturation model  @xcite that was shown to be able to fit @xmath15 correlation @xmath19 even moments data without final - state interactions . that saturation model has also been used in  @xcite to specify initial conditions for perfect fluid hydrodynamics in @xmath5 . however , in @xmath4 the transverse spatial structure of initial conditions is not as well - controlled because the gluon saturation scale scale , @xmath20 , is small and its fluctutations over the transverse plane on sub - nucleon scales are more model dependent than in @xmath5 .",
    "the near independence of @xmath14 moments on beam energy observed in the bes  @xcite at rhic from 7.7 agev to 2.76  atev pose another serious challenges to the uniqueness of the perfect fluid interpretations of the data because previous hybrid fluid - hrg modeling  @xcite predicted a natural systematic reduction of the moments due to the increasing hrg corona fraction with decreasing beam energy .",
    "the hrg corona fraction is expected to dilute flow signatures from the perfect fluid qgp core flow at lower energies .",
    "the bes  @xcite data also a pose a challenge to color glass condensate ( cgc ) gluon saturation models  @xcite used to specify initial conditions for hydrodynamic flow predictions in @xmath5 .",
    "this is because @xmath21 is predicted to decrease with @xmath22 , and , thus , gluon saturation - dominated `` central rapidity region '' gluon fusion dynamics must switch over into valence quark - diquark dominated `` fragmentation region '' inelastic dynamics involving fragmentation of multiple quark - diquark beam jets .    in our glvb paper",
    "@xcite we explored the possibility that initial - state gluon bremsstrahlung , sourced by color scintillating arrays ( csa ) of colored beam jet antennae , could partially account for the above puzzling systematics of azimuthal harmonics .",
    "non - abelian bremsstrahlung is intrinsically azimuthally anisotropic .",
    "the pqcd - based glvb model extends the first order in opacity @xmath23 gunion - bertsch  @xcite ( gb ) perturbative qcd bremsstrahlung to all orders in opacity , @xmath24  @xcite , vitev - gunion - bertsch ( vgb )  @xcite multiple interaction pqcd bremsstrahlung for applications to @xmath25 nuclear collisions .",
    "we show that vgb bremsstrahlung naturally leads on an event - by - event basis to a hierarchy of non trivial azimuthal asymmetry moments remarkably similar to that observed in @xmath4 and peripheral @xmath5 at fixed @xmath26  @xcite",
    "the non - abelian bremsstrahlung gunion - bertsch ( gb ) formula  @xcite for the soft gluon radiation single inclusive distribution for a triggered beam jet recoil momentum @xmath27 is @xmath28 here , the parton scattering elastic cross section is assumed to be @xmath29 .",
    "the produced gluon has rapidity @xmath30 and transverse momentum @xmath31 .",
    "note especially that the azimuthally asymmetric angular dependence has the simple form , @xmath32 of the radiated @xmath33 relative to the reaction plane @xmath34 angles arising from basic non - abelian interference effects .",
    "note also the uniform rapidity - even , @xmath35 , distribution of non - abelian bremsstrahlung . in @xmath4",
    "multiple target beam jets generally transform that uniform @xmath30 dependence into a trapezoidal one , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the gb azimuthal harmonics can then be analytically evaluated from @xmath36 \\;(\\ ; v_1^{gb}(k , q)\\;)^n \\ ; , \\label{gbsc}\\\\ v_1^{gb}(k , q ) & = & ( a_{kq}-\\sqrt{a^2_{kq}-1 } ) \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{vn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( see @xcite ) @xmath37 implies that all harmonics are peaked near @xmath38 , vanish at @xmath39 , and slowly decrease toward zero for @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the analytic single color antenna gb gluon harmonics obey an approximate power law scaling with respect to the harmonic @xmath41 number : @xmath42^{1/n } & = & \\;[v_m^{gb}(k , q,0)]^{1/m } \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{vnscaling}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is similar to the scaling observed by alice , cms and atlas  @xcite at lhc and similar to perfect fluid harmonic scaling for the higher @xmath43 moments dominated by purely geometric fluctuations .",
    "we note also that unlike the low order cgc azimuthal harmonics , the gb bremsstrahlung harmonics are non - vanishing and scale for all odd as well as even moments @xmath41 .",

    "the @xmath63 target dipoles naturally cluster near the projectile impact parameter @xmath64 as illustrated in fig .",
    "( 1b ) . in a specific event , there are however only @xmath65 overlapping clusters that can radiate coherently toward the negative rapidity @xmath66 hemisphere ( see @xcite ) .",
    "incoherence of target clusters bremsstrahlung is controlled by the transverse resolution scale with @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 denote the cumulative momentum transfer to the projectile from target cluster @xmath69 .",
    "the total single inclusive bremsstrahlung distribution into a particular mode @xmath70 has the form @xmath71 where we define @xmath72 to include the projectile beam jet contribution into the summation over target clusters .",
    "note that for a semi exclusive event with all @xmath73 target recoil momenta @xmath74 and their azimuthal orientation @xmath75 determined , the bremsstrahlung radiation is peaked near the @xmath76 cumulative momenta .",
    "however , averaging over all reaction planes forces all single particle @xmath77 to vanish on the average . only 2 or higher particle correlation can reveal the intrinsic azimuthal anisotropy correlations above .",
    "fortunately , in this csa bremsstrahlung model all @xmath78 relative azimuthal harmonics can also be evaluated analytically ( see  @xcite ) .    in",
    "the `` mean recoil '' approximation @xmath79 , we find that a single gb antenna satisfies the generalized power scaling law in case that subsets of the @xmath78 gluons have identical momenta .",
    "suppose there are @xmath80 distinct momenta @xmath81 with @xmath82 such @xmath83 of the @xmath78 gluons have momenta equal to a particular value @xmath81 such that @xmath84 . in this case @xmath85 .",
    "the approximate factorization and power scaling of azimuthal harmonics from csa coherent state non - abelian bremsstrahlung is similar to `` perfect fluid hydrodynamic collective flow '' factorization and scaling , but in this case no assumption about local equilibration or minimal viscosity is necessary .",
    "in this talk we summarized from ref .",
    "@xcite some of the remarkable azimuthal correlation properties of beam jet non - abelian bremsstrahlung even at the lowest order of perturbative qcd level using the vgb generalization  @xcite of gb  @xcite bremsstrahlung to all orders in opacity in @xmath4 . of course",
    ", higher order and especially high gluon occupation number effects  @xcite could modify the intricate initial - state chromo wave interference patterns .",
    "however , the main lesson from this study is that in @xmath4 initial - state wave interference phenomena may well dominate over any final - state dynamics but appear as if `` perfect fluid '' or `` conformal holographic '' descriptions@xcite were applicable on sub nucleon transverse scales .",
    "our analysis shows that long range in @xmath30 multi - gluon , @xmath44 power law scaling , azimuthal multipole cumulant signatures are not unique to final - state perfect fluid and dual ads shock wave flows but can arise also naturally from perturbative qcd features of initial state bremsstrahlung from color scintillating arrays of multiple beam jets . a possible way to help discriminate between initial - state interference harmonics and final - state flow harmonics may be through the study of rapidity dependence of multi - gluon azimuthal harmonics as discussed in  @xcite",
