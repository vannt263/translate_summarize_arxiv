    "electron bunches with very small transverse emittance and high peak current are needed for the operation of xfels @xcite .",
    "this is achieved using a two - step strategy : first generate beams with small transverse emittance using an rf photocathode and , second , apply longitudinal compression at high energy using a magnetic chicane .",
    "the bunch length for xfel applications is of order of 100 femtoseconds . since detailed understanding of longitudinal dynamics in this new domain of accelerator physics is of paramount importance for fel performance , experiments on this subject",
    "are planned in test facilities .",
    "the femtosecond time scale is beyond the range of standard electronic display instrumentation and the development of nondestructive methods for the measurement of the longitudinal beam current distribution in such short bunches is undoubtedly a challenging problem : in this paper we discuss one of these methods , which is based on spectral measurements of coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) produced by a bunch passing a dipole magnet or an undulator .",
    "after the compression stage , the csr pulse can be analyzed , for example , with a spectrometer . as we point out in section 2",
    ", we can decompose the coherent radiation spectrum , @xmath3 , into the product of the square modulus of the bunch form factor , @xmath4 , and the single particle radiation spectrum , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the csr spectrum , then , provides information on the bunch form factor , although one has to keep in mind that , in order to find @xmath6 from @xmath3 , one needs the quantity @xmath5 .",
    "section 3 contains a systematic treatment of synchrotron radiation theory .",
    "all the results presented in this section are derived from fundamental laws of electrodynamics and the reader can follow the whole derivation process from beginning to end .",
    "we use a synthetic approach to present the material : simple situations are studied first , and more complicated ones are introduced gradually . previous experience in synchrotron radiation theory would be helpful but is not absolutely necessary , because all the required material is independently derived . in this respect",
    "our paper is reasonably self - contained .",
    "a clear message in this work is that reexamination of dogmatic `` truths '' can sometimes yield surprises . for years",
    "we were led to believe that famous schwinger s formulas @xcite are directly applicable to the case of synchrotron radiation from dipole magnet and even now no attention is usually paid to the region of applicability of these expressions . while such formulas are valid in order to describe radiation from a dipole in the x - ray range , their long wavelength asymptotic are not valid , in general .",
    "analytical study of this matter was first performed in the 80 s @xcite .",
    "however , standard texts on synchrotron radiation theory do not seem to provide a derivation of the expression for the synchrotron radiation from an electron moving along an arc of a circle . in section 3",
    "we present such a derivation , which we believe is quite simple and instructive .",
    "properties of coherent synchrotron radiation from dipole magnets in the time domain are derived and discussed too .",
    "standard theory of synchrotron radiation relies upon other approximations too , and it seems interesting to pay attention to their region of applicability . to be specific ,",
    "two important limitations are discussed .",
    "first , it is usually assumed that the observer lies at infinite distance from the source .",
    "second , people do nt pay attention to the fact that , in real experimental conditions , the radiation is seen by the detector through some limited aperture .",
    "thus , both finite distance effects and diffraction effects are ignored .",
    "the aperture sizes and the distances for which the latter assumptions are valid are so large , in long wavelength range , as to be of limited practical interest .",
    "we can draw at least two main conclusions from section 3 : first , long wavelength radiation spectrum distortions can arise , physically , from violation of the far zone assumption or from aperture limitations ( or both ) .",
    "second , a csr diagnostic method based on the famous schwinger s formulas ( or the ones derived in @xcite ) is of purely theoretical interest . in real accelerators ,",
    "the long wavelength synchrotron radiation from bending magnet in the near zone integrates over many different vacuum chamber pieces with widely varying aperture and @xmath5 is usually a very difficult quantity to calculate with great accuracy .    an effective and practical technique based on the spectral properties of undulator radiation",
    "can be used to characterize the bunch profile function .",
    "the method we describe in section 4 uses an electromagnetic undulator and it is based on recording the energy of coherent radiation pulses in the central cone .",
    "this coherent radiation energy turns out to be proportional , per pulse , to the square modulus of the bunch form - factor at the resonant frequency of the fundamental harmonic .",
    "the measurement must be repeated many times with different undulator resonant frequencies ( which are tuned by changing the undulator parameters ) in order to reconstruct the modulus of the bunch form - factor .",
    "the retrieval of the bunch profile function from the modulus of its form factor is preformed , in section 5 , by means of a deconvolution technique . for the present work we choose a constrained deconvolution method .",
    "this consists in finding the best estimate of the bunch profile function , @xmath7 , for a particularly measured form - factor modulus , @xmath8 , including utilization of any a priori available information about @xmath7 . in the end of the paper we illustrate with a numerical example the potential of the proposed technique for diagnostics at the tesla test facility accelerator .",
    "here we have chosen , for emphasis , an experiment aimed at measuring the strongly non - gaussian electron bunch profile at ttf , phase 2 in femtosecond mode operation .",
    "the femtosecond mode operation is based on the experience obtained during the operation of the ttf fel , phase 1 @xcite and it requires one bunch compressor only .",
    "an electron bunch with a sharp spike at the head is prepared with an rms width of about 20 microns and a peak current of about one ka .",
    "this spike in the bunch generates fel pulses with duration below one hundred femtoseconds .",
    "we demonstrate that a tandem combination of a picosecond streak camera and csr spectrometer can be used to extract shape information from electron bunches with a narrow leading peak and a long tail .",
    "to begin our consideration , let us recall some well - known aspects of csr . from a microscopic viewpoint ,",
    "the electron beam current at the entrance of a bending magnet is made up of moving electrons arriving randomly at the entrance of the bending magnet :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the delta function , @xmath11 is the ( negative ) electron charge , @xmath12 is the number of electrons in a bunch and @xmath13 is the random arrival time of the electron at the bending magnet entrance .",
    "the electron bunch profile is described by the profile function @xmath7 .",
    "the beam current averaged over an ensemble of bunches can be written in the form :    @xmath14    the profile function for an electron beam with gaussian current distribution is given by :    @xmath15    and the probability of arrival of an electron during the time interval @xmath16 is just equal to @xmath17 .",
    "the electron beam current , @xmath18 , and its fourier transform , @xmath19 , are connected by    @xmath20    @xmath21    and , therefore , the average value of @xmath22 can be written as :    @xmath23    the expression @xmath24 is nothing but the fourier transform of the bunch profile function @xmath7 , since :    @xmath25    thus we can write :    @xmath26    where the fourier transform of the gaussian profile function has the form :    @xmath27    above we described the properties of the input signal in the frequency domain .",
    "the next step is the derivation of the spectral function connecting the fourier amplitudes of the output field and the fourier amplitudes of the input signal .",
    "we will investigate the synchrotron radiation in the framework of a one - dimensional model .",
    "also , we will assume that the cross section of the particle beam is small compared with the distance to the observer , so that the path length difference from any point of the beam cross section to the observer are small compared to the shortest wavelength involved .",
    "the component of synchrotron radiation electric field in time domain , @xmath28 , and its fourier transform , @xmath29 , are connected by    @xmath30    and the fourier harmonic for @xmath31 is defined by the relation @xmath32 . on the other hand , the fourier harmonic of the electromagnetic field and the fourier harmonic of the current at the dipole magnet entrance are connected by :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the synchrotron radiation spectral function of the dipole . since the radiation power is proportional to the square of the radiation field , the averaged total power at a certain frequency @xmath35 is given by the expression :    @xmath36 \\ , \\label{eq : first}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the radiation power from one electron .",
    "the first term @xmath12 in square bracket represents ordinary incoherent synchrotron radiation with a power proportional to the number of radiating particles .",
    "the second term represents coherent synchrotron radiation .",
    "the actual coherent radiation power spectrum depends on the particular particle distribution in the bunch . for photon wavelengths equal and longer than the bunch length",
    ", we expect all particles within a bunch to radiate coherently and the intensity to be proportional to the square of the number of @xmath12 of particles rather than linearly proportional to @xmath12 , as in the usual incoherent case .",
    "this quadratic effect can greatly enhance the radiation since the bunch population can be from @xmath37 to @xmath38 electrons .",
    "on the other hand the coherent radiation power falls off rapidly for wavelengths as short or even shorter than the rms bunch length .    a method for estimating the bunch profile function @xmath7 is to compute the factor @xmath5 , to measure the csr power spectrum @xmath3 and to deduce the factor @xmath6 from equation ( [ eq : first ] ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the retrievable information about the profile function will , in general , not be complete , for it is the particular measured square modulus of the form - factor that can be obtained , not the complex form - factor itself .",
    "the phenomenon of coherent synchrotron radiation has been introduced in a conceptual way in the preceding section . as was pointed out ,",
    "the csr power spectrum is the product of the square modulus of bunch form - factor @xmath39 , and the single - particle power spectrum @xmath5 .",
    "any diagnostics method based on csr must devote therefore attention to correctly determinate the synchrotron radiation spectrum from one electron @xmath5 , for this quantity plays a critical role in the form - factor measurement . in the present section we will deal with the properties of the single - particle radiation in time and in frequency domain as well as with the csr properties in time domain . in order to give the subject a semblance of continuity , it will be desirable to introduce considerable matter which can be found in any of standard text on synchrotron radiation theory ( see for example @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the typical textbook treatment consists in finding the expression for the synchrotron radiation spectrum from an electron moving in a circle .",
    "however , no attention is usually paid to the region of applicability of the derived expressions .",
    "for instance , the standard extension of the theory to the case of synchrotron radiation from dipole magnet is based on the assumption that the energy spectrum formula is equivalent to the famous schwinger s formula @xcite . while this formula is valid for the x - ray range , it does not provide a satisfactory description in the long wavelength asymptotic @xcite .",
    "moreover scwinger s formulas are found in the limit of an infinite observer distance and under the approximation of no limiting aperture through which the radiation is collected .",
    "here we pay particular attention to the region of applicability of schwinger s formulas ; specifically , we derive expressions for the time and frequency dependence of the electromagnetic radiation produced by an electron moving along an arc of a circle , and we investigate how the csr field pulse in the time domain is modified in more realistic situations .",
    "let us start reviewing how a single electron radiates as it moves in a dipole magnet .",
    "the electron is subjected to an acceleration , @xmath40 , of magnitude @xmath41 so that a distant observer detects the electric and magnetic fields in the form of electromagnetic waves from the radiating electron .",
    "[ fig : dsm1 ] shows the relationship between the observer at a fixed point @xmath42 , whose coordinates are @xmath43 , and the radiating electron at @xmath44 , @xmath45 being the emission ( or retarded ) time .",
    "the fundamental laws of electrodynamics tell that the electric field of a charge @xmath11 moving along an arbitrary trajectory is given by the lienard - wiechert formula    @xmath46_{\\mathrm{r } } + \\frac{(-e)}{c\\mid\\vec{r}\\mid } \\left[\\frac{\\vec{n}\\times[(\\vec{n } - \\vec{\\beta})\\times\\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}]}{(1 - \\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\beta})^{3}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{r } } \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is a unit vector along the line from the point at which the radiation is emitted at the emission time to the observation point at the observation time , and we understand that the quantity in brackets must be evaluated at the retarded time @xmath48 .",
    "the latter equation consists of two distinct parts .",
    "the first is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between radiation source and observer , depends only on the charge velocity and is known as velocity or coulomb field .",
    "the second is inversely proportional to the distance from the charge , depends also on the charge acceleration and it is known as acceleration or radiation field . at large distances from the moving electron , the acceleration - related term dominates , and it is usually associated to the electromagnetic radiation of the charge .",
    "the region of space where the radiation field dominates is called a far ( or wave ) zone and the radiative electric field in the far zone is given by the formula    @xmath49}{(1 - \\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\beta})^{3}}\\right]_{\\mathrm{r } } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : lwf}\\ ] ]    we can use ( [ eq : lwf ] ) to look at all kinds of interesting problems .",
    "this is a complicated expression , but it is easy enough to be used in a computer calculation which can be further visualized as a geometrical picture .",
    "such geometrical pictures will give us a good qualitative description of the situation .",
    "usual theory of synchrotron radiation is based on the assumption that the electron is moving on a circle and radiation is observed from the whole circular trajectory , so that in each cycle we get a sharp pulse of electric field . a far - field computation of the predicted time dependence of synchrotron radiation for circular motion is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : srap ] .",
    "the horizontal component of electric field plotted versus the normalized variable @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the critical frequency of synchrotron radiation .",
    "the field in the orbital plane has a zero around @xmath52 . numerically from fig .",
    "[ fig : srap ] one obtains    @xmath53    it is interesting to stress the fact that equation ( [ eq : z ] ) is strictly related to the well - known result that a uniformly charged ring does not radiate .",
    "in fact , starting from ( [ eq : z ] ) one can show that a system of @xmath12 identical equidistant charges @xmath11 moving with constant velocity @xmath54 along a circle does not radiate in the limit for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and the electric and the magnetic fields of the system are the usual static values .",
    "it is important to realize that ( [ eq : z ] ) is valid only when the electron is moving in a circle .",
    "but we now want to study synchrotron radiation from an electron moving along the arc of a circle ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dsm11 ] ) . by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : sh25a ] - [ fig : sh05 ] , one can see that when the electron moves in arcs of circles with different angular extensions @xmath57 , the time - average of the electric field is nonzero .",
    "let us consider for a moment ( in parallel with what has been done in the case of a circle ) the case of infinitely long electron bunch with the homogeneous linear density @xmath58 and current @xmath59 .",
    "a current circuit consists of the arc and semi - infinite straight lines ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dsm22 ] ) .",
    "the angle between the straight lines is equal to the bending angle @xmath60 of the magnet .",
    "the fact that the average electric field from a single particle is different from zero means that the acceleration field from our infinite circuit must be different from zero too .",
    "then we have deal with an intriguing paradox , since it is a well known result that an uniform electron current does not radiate , not only in the case of circular motion , but independently from the trajectory .",
    "it is possible to explain this contradiction in very simple terms as follows .",
    "first of all we know that the velocity ( electric ) field from a line current ( including our case ) is proportional to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the distance of the observer from the line charge .",
    "second , in our case , the acceleration part of the electric field is proportional to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the distance of the observer from the magnet ( since the acceleration field sources are strictly limited to the particles in the magnet only ) .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsm22 ] : the ratio @xmath65 is finite for any position of observer therefore there is no region in space where the acceleration field dominates .",
    "this last observation solves our paradox since , in the case of infinite charge current in an arc of a circle , we can not talk about far zone at all , although a non - zero acceleration field is present .",
    "it is interesting to discuss , at this point , the shape of the coherent synchrotron radiation field pulse under different trajectories .",
    "what we have been dealing with before is simply a far field analysis of the single - particle radiation field .",
    "when a large number of electrons move together , all the same way , the total field will be a linear superposition of the individual particle fields .",
    "of course the result depends upon the longitudinal distribution of the electrons .",
    "one aspect of the problem that we can immediately deal with is the coherent synchrotron radiation production from a `` short '' magnet , i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "we can assert that the field appears as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsm5 ] .",
    "in fact the time - dependence of the field has , for every electron , the shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sh05 ] and the total field emitted by the electron bunch is represented by a sum of these pulses , one for each radiating electron . in the limit for `` short '' magnets ,",
    "the reader can easily come to the intuitive conclusion that the time profile of the electron bunch density is linearly encoded onto the electric field of the radiation pulse .",
    "the width of the temporal profile of the electric field corresponds directly to the electron bunch length , and the shape of the temporal profile is proportional to the longitudinal bunch distribution .",
    "we have just argued that the bunch density is linear encoded onto the electric field as in fig . [",
    "fig : dsm5 ] ; nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsm5 ] , we illustrate small fluctuations which occur in the field amplitude too .",
    "the reason for this is that the electron bunch is composed of large number of electrons , thus fluctuations always exist in the electron beam density due to shot noise effects . for any synchrotron radiation beam",
    "there is some characteristic time , which determines the time scale of the random field fluctuations .",
    "this characteristic time is called coherence time @xmath67 of synchrotron radiation and its magnitude is of the order of the pulse duration from one electron .",
    "the physical significance of these fluctuations is that there is a short wavelength radiation component of the radiation in the range of the inverse pulse duration from a single electron .",
    "simple physical considerations show that the energy spectrum of this hard radiation component is order of @xmath68 .",
    "this explains the relation between small fluctuations of the radiation field amplitude and spontaneous ( incoherent ) emission of synchrotron radiation .    up to this point we only talked about coherent radiation from a `` short '' magnet .",
    "ultimately we want to consider csr production from an arc of a circle .",
    "an easier step in this direction consists in the analysis of the csr time pulse from a circular motion .",
    "it is possible , indeed , to derive a simple analytical expression for the csr pulse from a bunch with an arbitrary distribution of the linear density satisfying the following condition :    @xmath69    the latter condition simply indicates that the characteristic length of the bunch is much larger than @xmath70 .",
    "let us express the total csr pulse as a superposition of single particle fields at a given position in the far zone :    @xmath71    where we calibrated the observer time in such a way that , when @xmath72 , the single particle radiation pulse has its maximum at @xmath73 . to calculate the integral in ( [ eq : csr2 ] )",
    "one should take into account the property ( [ eq : z ] ) of the kernel @xmath74 which has been discussed above .",
    "using ( [ eq : z ] ) and ( [ eq : csr1 ] ) one can simplify equation ( [ eq : csr2 ] ) in the following way .",

    "numerical calculation results show that , at the value @xmath256 , we have @xmath258 .",
    "we should say that our approximate treatment of coherent velocity field breaks down once source and observer get as close as they are at @xmath259 .",
    "we have , however , a simple explanation for that .",
    "in addition to the antisymmetric part of kernel we have just described , there is also a symmetric part .",
    "when source and observer are far apart the observer sees only the antisymmetric part and the average of electric field from one electron is close to zero . at very close distances there begins to be some extra symmetric part of the kernel .",
    "this symmetric field , which also varies with the separation , should be , of course , included in more precise estimates .      until now we have considered the case in which electrons moves in a circle . here",
    "we will generalize this situation and study the case where the electrons move along an arc of a circle . in order to fully characterize the magnet length required to assure the accuracy of the circular motion model , it is necessary to specify the distortion of schwinger spectrum associated with all interesting magnet lengths in an experiment .",

    "the latter kind of radiation field can be described in terms of diffraction theory .",
    "diffraction is the process by which radiation is redirected near sharp edges .",
    "as it propagates away from these sharp edges , it interferes with nearby non - diffracted radiation , producing interference patterns .",
    "a finite aperture introduces , therefore , diffraction effects specific to the geometry and clearly dependent on the wavelength . for structures such as pinholes it is found that these diffraction patterns propagate away from the structure at angles of order @xmath265 , where @xmath262 is the characteristic aperture dimension .",
    "the region of applicability for the far diffraction zone where effects play a significant role is given by the relation @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is the distance between observer and aperture .",

    "the significance of the discussed limitation can not be fully appreciated until we determine typical values of the parameters that can be expected in practice .",
    "for example , if @xmath271 and @xmath272 , @xmath273 , so that at distance greater than 10 cm from the aperture , a 1 cm diameter hole would be sufficiently narrow to perturb significantly the synchrotron radiation spectrum at that wavelength .",
    "the computation of spectrum distortions for practical accelerator applications is a rather difficult problem .",
    "one encounters vacuum chamber components which require special attention and sophisticated techniques should be developed to deal with this situation .",
    "the character of spectrum distortions largely depends on the actual geometry and on the material of the vacuum chamber , so that we may expect significant complications in the determination of these distortions along a vacuum enclosure of the actual device .",
    "the vacuum chamber of an accelerator presents a too complicated geometry to allow an analytical expression for spectrum distortions . in principle",
    "each section of the vacuum chamber must be treated individually . by employing two or three - dimensional numerical codes it may be possible to determine the spectrum for a particular component . yet , every accelerator is somewhat different from another and will have its own particular spectrum distortions .",
    "for this reason , in this discussions we focused only on basic ideas about aperture limitations .",
    "to optimally meet the needs for beam diagnostic measurements with the features of synchrotron radiation , it is desirable to provide specific radiation characteristics that can not be obtained from bending magnets but require special magnetic systems . to generate specific synchrotron radiation characteristics ,",
    "radiation is often produced by special insertion devices installed along the particle beam path .",

    "we know that , in the case under examination , the bunching process in zero order approximation can be treated by single particle dynamical theory .",
    "we can not neglect the csr induced energy spread and other wake fields when we calculate the transverse emittance , but we can neglect them when we calculate the longitudinal current distribution , simply because their contribution to the longitudinal dynamics is small . as a result , we will show that we can define a general temporal structure of the electron bunch after compression without any measurements .",
    "the purpose of the measurement is then to determine the numerical value of the parameters on which such temporal structure depends . in this case , sufficient information is provided by the modulus of the bunch form - factor , allowing us to ignore the phase information .",
    "the process of finding the best estimate of the profile function @xmath7 for a particular measured modulus of the bunch form - factor , including utilization of any a priori information available about @xmath7 refers to a technique called `` constrained deconvolution '' which will be exemplified below in detail . although the context in which the suggestion of this method was made first was spectroscopy @xcite , the ideas apply equally well in the present context of bunch profile reconstruction .",
    "let us consider an example which shows the deconvolution process in easy - to - understand circumstances . for emphasis",
    "we choose , here , an experiment aimed at measuring the strongly non - gaussian electron bunch profile at ttf , phase 2 in femtosecond mode operation .",
    "the femtosecond mode operation is based on experience obtained during the operation of the ttf fel , phase 1 @xcite and it requires one bunch compressor only .",
    "an electron bunch with a sharp spike at the head is prepared , with rms width of about 20 microns and a peak current of about one ka .",
    "this spike in the bunch generates fel pulses with duration below one hundred femtoseconds .",
    "an example of the longitudinal phase - space distribution for a compressed beam with rf curvature effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phsp ] , when the longitudinal bunch charge distribution involves concentration of charges in a small fraction of the bunch length . in the femtosecond mode",
    "the first ttf magnetic chicane only will be operational , and this will be the default mode of operation for first lasing .",
    "bunch compression for relativistic situations can effectively be achieved , at the time being , only by inducing a correlation between longitudinal position and energy offset with an rf system and taking advantage of the energy dependence of the path length in a magnetic bypass section ( a so - called magnetic chicane ) . in order to study the csr diagnostic for a compressed bunch ,",
    "let us first find the longitudinal charge distribution for our bunch model when it is fully compressed by a chicane ( here we assume that the perturbation of the bunching process by csr is negligible ) .",
    "downstream of the chicane the charge distribution is strongly non - gaussian with a narrow leading peak and a long tail , as it is seen from the simulation results in fig .",
    "[ fig : phsp ] .",
    "our attention is focused on determining the longitudinal density distribution after compression . as first was shown in @xcite",
    "there is an analytical function which provides quite a good approximation for the simulation data .",
    "the current distribution along the beam after a single compression is given by    @xmath350    equation ( [ eqn : u3 ] ) gives a good fit .",
    "to illustrate how good an approximation to the actual current distribution is provided by ( [ eqn : u3 ] ) , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : i10 ] the current as a function of time , first the numerical simulation data , then as computed from ( [ eqn : u3 ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : u3 ] ) involves four independent parameters in the calculation of longitudinal density distribution : @xmath351 , which characterizes the local charge concentration ( non - gaussian feature ) of the compressed density , @xmath352 , which characterizes the bunch tail and fitting parameters , @xmath353 and @xmath354 . in this case",
    "detailed information on the longitudinal bunch distribution ( actually constants : @xmath351 , @xmath352 and @xmath353 , @xmath354 ) can be derived from the particular measured square modulus of the bunch form - factor by using an independently obtained tail constant @xmath352 ( for example by means of a streak camera ) .",
    "a quantity of considerable physical interest is the parameter @xmath351 which characterizes the leading peak .",
    "the value of @xmath351 can be related to the value of the initial local energy spread @xmath355 in the electron beam if the compaction factor @xmath356 of the magnetic chicane is known .",
    "[ fig : i5 ] shows plots of the peak current versus time for several values of the local energy spread . by comparing these curves",
    ", some feeling can be obtained about the effective reduction in peak current . as the energy spread is increased from 5 kev to 15 kev",
    ", the maximum peak current falls from 3.5 ka to 2 ka .",
    "the highest time resolution obtainable by means of a streak camera is in the sub - picosecond range . by means of coherent radiation , the resolution can be made comparatively high because the resolution is determined by the spectral range in the measurement .",
    "hence , this method will be useful for monitoring an ultra - short electron bunch at ttf fel . in the ttf fel phase 2",
    "the measurement of csr spectrum can be made by using long period electromagnetic undulator as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsm13 ] .",
    "as already said , for the complete determination of the bunch profile function , downstream of the first ttf fel bunch compressor , a measurement of the bunch length can be made independently by using a sub - picosecond resolution streak camera .",
    "the limiting resolution of the streak camera will prevent the measurement of the spike width .",
    "nevertheless , the streak camera can detect the long time tail which is outside the csr detector response .",
    "the significance of the proposed scheme can not be fully appreciated until we determine typical values of the energy in the radiation pulse detected within the central cone that can be expected in practice . in the case of ttf fel",
    ", the bunch form factor modulus falls off rapidly for wavelengths shorter than 40 microns . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "the dependence of the form factor on the exact shape of the electron bunch is rather weak and can be ignored outside the wavelength range @xmath357 .",
    "this point is made clear upon examination of the curves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ff5 ] . the energy in the radiation pulse can be estimated simply as in ( [ eq : ecc ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : er5 ] it is quite clear that in the @xmath358 wavelength region of the csr spectrum any local energy spread in the electron beam smaller than 20 kev produces energies larger than @xmath359 in the radiation pulse .    to conclude this section we present examples of deconvolution of computer generated data ; we hope that these will provide useful insight into the practical limits of deconvolution .",
    "we will demonstrate that constrained deconvolution is a useful experimental tool testable at each step in its development . by far",
    "the easiest and most informative way to examine the deconvolution process is to use a computer in place of a csr spectrometer . by simulating a spectrum rather than using an actual csr spectrometer to record it",
    ", we have a complete control over such factors as resolution , shape and noise . also , we know what the perfectly deconvolved profile function would look like . in the deconvolution of actual csr spectral data ,",
    "the presence of noise is usually the main limiting factor : the effects of noise on deconvolution are demonstrated in the following .",
    "for the purpose of examining the deconvolution process , we begin with noisy data , which of course , can be realized in a simulation process . when other aspects of deconvolution , such as errors in the prior information are examined , noiseless data are used .",
    "our goal is to discover the limiting sensitivity of the measurement technique considered .",
    "attention is therefore turned to the crucial question of how accurately the bunch profile parameters can be measured by this technique when the errors in the input data can not be neglected . surely , the preferable way to answer the question about errors in bunch form - factor measurement is the computer experiments way .",
    "the effects of various errors are included in a full simulation of deconvolution procedure .",
    "one important question to answer is about how well the modulus of bunch form factor must be known in order to perform a successful deconvolution . to obtain the sensitivity to error effects ,",
    "we use a set of input error data for a simulated bunch profile spectrum ( see fig . [",
    "fig : ff40 ] ) . a 40% rms error ( variable over the undulator scan )",
    "is included .",
    "the sensitivities of the final bunch profile function to the simulation input errors are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffer ] .",
    "only one random seed has been presented here as an example , but several seeds have been run with similar success . fig .",
    "[ fig : ffer ] shows that rms of csr measurement should be within @xmath360 .",
    "it is seen that the constrained deconvolution method is insensitive to the errors in the bunch form - factor .",
    "as shown above , the bunch profile function is given by ( [ eqn : u3 ] ) .",
    "an important issue to deal with consists in determining the dependence of the deconvolved function on the tail constant .",
    "one way to investigate this matter is to use a set of tail constants which differ from the real one in the deconvolution of a simulated spectrum .",
    "[ fig : i10 t ] shows the results of such a test . at first glance",
    "all three traces of fig .",
    "[ fig : i10 t ] are practically identical , indicating that the tail parameter is less important than it would have probably been expected .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the width of the tail parameter should be within @xmath361 of the proper value .",
    "however , if the correct tail function is not readily determined ( by a streak camera ) there is some justification for deconvolution with a `` good guess '' because even the extreme case shown in fig . [",
    "fig : i10 t ] is superior to trace the profile function without prior information .",
    "electron pulse - shape measurement is achieved by a three - step process .",
    "\\(i ) in the first step spectrum of coherent radiation @xmath3 is measured .",
    "coherent radiation from dipole magnet is emitted over a wide spectrum and should be analyzed with a spectrometer or interferometer .",
    "the proposed technique of using csr from an undulator may be a more promising approach .",
    "the basic measurement in this case is extremely simple : the energy of the coherent radiation pulse within the central cone is recorded by a bolometer . in order to use the radiation from the undulator it has to be filtered : for such a purpose , a simple pinhole can be used .",
    "\\(ii ) the second step is to deduce the modulus of the bunch form - factor from the equation @xmath362 ; @xmath5 should be applied to the result of the measurement , to obtain the bunch form factor . a careful analysis of the diagnostic instrumentation is required to find its exact @xmath5 function .",
    "the computation of the single - particle spectrum for practical accelerator applications is a rather difficult problem .",
    "the long wavelength synchrotron radiation from bending magnets in the near zone integrates over many different vacuum chamber pieces and the quantity @xmath5 is usually very difficult to know with good accuracy within the long wavelength range . in principle , modern computers allow one to perform direct calculation of the factor @xmath5 .",
    "the results of such simulations will depend on a large number of parameters .",
    "they will provide the possibility of obtaining a numerical answer for a specific set of input data , but hardly help to understand the physics of the problem .",
    "success come to those who start from the physical point of view and begin by making the right kind of approximations , knowing what is large and what is small in a given complicated situation .",
    "we hope that the simple model employed here offers a useful introduction to the more formidable problems which arise in the computation of spontaneous emission spectrum distortions for real accelerators .",
    "\\(iii ) the third step consists in the reconstruction of the electron bunch profile from the measured data .",
    "the csr spectrum measurement has an important limitation : it does not provide any information on the phase content of the pulse .",
    "it is clear that the retrievability of the information about the electron bunch profile function will in general not be complete , for it is the particular measured square modulus of the form - factor that can be obtained , not the complex form - factor itself .",
    "no spectral phase information is available , and the complete profile function can not be obtained in general .",
    "nevertheless , the less complete information can be exceedingly useful in many cases .",
    "for example , downstream of the bunch compressor the bunch charge distribution is strongly non - gaussian with a narrow leading peak and a long tail . in this case",
    "detailed information about the longitudinal bunch distribution can be derived from the measured square modulus @xmath6 by measuring the bunch tail constant with a streak camera and by using all a - priori available information about profile function . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that constrained deconvolution is a useful experimental tool testable at each step in its development .",
    "although the present work is concerned primarily with fully compressed electron bunch downstream of the first bunch compressor , its applicability is not restricted to that area only : for example , multistage bunch compression is a suitable candidate for treatment by the methods described here .",
