    "one of the basic facets of research and actual deployment in smart grid has been increased data collection from different meters for improved monitoring and control of dynamic events .",
    "accurate data collection also aids formation of optimal prices and price - responsive demand .",
    "however , a data driven approach makes the grid vulnerable to cyber - attacks on meter measurements .",
    "a coordinated data attack on meter recordings in phasor measurement units ( pmus ) @xcite and remote terminal units ( rtus ) or on the communication channels in supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) systems can in principle lead to incorrect electricity prices as well as to large blackouts .",
    "data attacks on meter measurements in the power grid is an active area of research .",
    "the authors of @xcite first introduced the problem of undetectable data attacks that bypass bad - data tests at the state estimator .",
    "simple linear algebraic techniques show that if the malicious measurements lie in the column space of the measurement matrix , the attack goes undetected . in reference",
    "@xcite , an attack vector consisting of the malicious measurements is constructed using projection matrices based on the measurement matrix .",
    "this work has been followed by several techniques to select locations for introducing data attacks under different grid conditions and adversarial objectives .",
    "reference @xcite discusses the construction of an optimal hidden attack that requires manipulation of the minimum number of measurements using @xmath0 and @xmath1 recovery methods .",
    "reference @xcite studies the creation of the optimal attack vector as a mixed integer linear program . the authors of @xcite discuss graph based design of optimal attack vectors for systems observed by pmus .",
    "data attacks aimed at affecting the estimation of a pre - specified set of state variables is presented in @xcite .",
    "a heuristic based detector for malicious data is presented in @xcite .",
    "a majority of the prior work in this area focus on constructing hidden data attacks that evade bad - data detection tests at the state estimator . in this paper",
    ", we analyze a detectable regime of data attacks .",
    "it is worth mentioning that at the state estimator , bad data detection is followed by a scheme for bad - data identification .",
    "our proposed attack regime succeeds despite detection by deceiving the bad - data identifier into labeling uncorrupted measurements as bad data . while writing this manuscript , we discovered a related work demonstration detectable data attacks in @xcite . the attack model in @xcite searches for an optimal hidden attack and then creates a detectable attack by corrupting only half of the measurements necessary for a hidden attack . in a sense ,",
    "our model is a generalization of the framework used in @xcite , with some key differences .",
    "our attack model considers power system cases where a subset of the measurements are incorruptible by the adversary . by overcoming the presence of incorruptible measurements ,",
    "the cardinality of our data attacks can be reduced by more than @xmath2 of the cardinality of the optimal hidden attack , whereas in @xcite , the reduction in cardinality is exactly by half .",
    "more importantly , unlike the framework in @xcite our detectable attack model is able to greatly expand the range of feasible attacks to configurations where no hidden attacks are possible .",
    "further , we show that considering incorruptible measurements in the system makes the problem of constructing an optimal detectable attack np - hard in general . in contrast",
    ", detectable attacks that do not overcome incorruptible measurements can be constructed in polynomial time in our measurement set - up .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section presents a description of the system model used in state estimation and bad - data detection , and then introduces our data attack model .",
    "we derive conditions necessary for a successful attack of our regime and provide provable guarantees on their cardinality in section [ sec : adversary solution ] . the two approximate algorithms to design an optimal attack vector for our regime",
    "are presented in section [ sec : algo ] . both of them require information limited to the structure of the measurement matrix and",
    "do not need the numerical values of grid parameters .",

    "it is shown in @xcite that for the general case of multiple bad data entries ( as in our case ) , a sequential bad - data remover described in previous literature , is sub - optimal .",
    "the optimal strategy for the estimator is to _ remove the minimum number of measurements _ such that the residual produced by the remaining measurements passes the bad - data detection test in ( [ test ] ) .",
    "in addition , the estimator needs to ensure that the removed measurements do not lead to a loss of rank in the measurement matrix as that will make the system unobservable .",
