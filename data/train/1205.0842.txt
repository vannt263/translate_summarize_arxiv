    "<S> measurements in bb84 bases are indeed common in many quantum cryptographic protocols . in particular , they are used in two - party cryptographic protocols in the bounded  @xcite and noisy - storage model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these models allow for the secure implementation of any two - party cryptographic primitive under the assumption that the adversary s quantum memory device is bounded and imperfect . </S>",
    "<S> this includes interesting primitives such as oblivious transfer , bit commitment , and even secure identification of e.g.  a user to an atm machine . </S>",
    "<S> the security of all protocols in this model crucially rests on the existence of uncertainty relations in terms of min - entropy  @xcite . yet </S>",
    "<S> , the value of @xmath35 for bb84 bases is usually too low to be cryptographically useful . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , a low value for @xmath27 means that the adversary s memory must be very limited and/or noisy for security to be possible  @xcite at all . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a low value of @xmath27 means that any experiment implementing such protocols can tolerate only a small amount of bit flip errors and losses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if @xmath36 is the bit flip error on the channel connecting alice and bob , then security for the cryptographic primitive known as oblivious transfer is possible if @xmath37  @xcite , where @xmath38 is the binary shannon entropy .    motivated by this need to obtain a strong uncertainty relation for bb84 bases , that is , a large @xmath27 , the authors of  @xcite considered the so - called _ smooth _ min - entropy @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , a lower bound @xmath27 on this quantity tells us that we do indeed have min - entropy at least @xmath27 , except for some small error parameter @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> formally , this quantity is defined as ( see appendix ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is @xmath43-close to @xmath0 in terms of the purified distance  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that at the expense of such a small error @xmath44 , a much stronger uncertainty relation can indeed be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has been shown  @xcite that for measurements in the bb84 bases and any @xmath45 $ ] , @xmath46 where @xmath47\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this relation in a cryptographic protocol only yields an additional error @xmath44 in the overall security error , and it is widely employed in the protocols of  @xcite .    from a theoretical ( asymptotic ) viewpoint , this uncertainty relation is certainly sufficient . yet , when it comes to putting any of such protocols into a practical experiment it has a small caveat : whereas @xmath44 decreases exponentially in the number of qubits @xmath30 , for a large amount of uncertainty , i.e. , @xmath48 , the convergence is extremely slow . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath49  @xcite corresponding to @xmath50 , we need @xmath51 to even have @xmath52 ! in an experiment using weak coherent pulses , with frequency of 1ghz and poisson parameter @xmath53 it takes approximately @xmath54 seconds to generate such an @xmath30  @xcite if there are absolutely no losses of any kind . </S>",
    "<S> however , compared to the generation time , a more significant inconvenience is that the classical post - processing of such large block lengths is time - consuming . </S>"
