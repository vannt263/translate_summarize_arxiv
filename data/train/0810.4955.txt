    "the last decade has seen the coming of age of extremely high multiplex fibre spectroscopy , as implemented by the 2-degree field ( 2df ) instrument @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "these new facilities have allowed order of magnitude increases in sample sizes over the previous generation of surveys . the 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ; croom et al . 2001a ; 2004 ) and the sdss qso survey ( schneider et al . 2007 ) have allowed precise measurement of the evolution of qsos ( e.g. boyle et al . 2000 ; croom et al .",
    "2004 ; richards et al . 2006 ) , qso clustering ( e.g. croom et al . 2001b ; croom et al . 2005 ; shen et al .",
    "2007 ) , spectral properties ( e.g. croom et al . 2002 ; corbett et al . 2003 ; vanden berk et al . 2001",
    "; richards et al .",
    "2002a ) and a range of other significant results .",
    "the published sample sizes ( @xmath10 qsos in 2qz ; @xmath11 qsos in sdss ) are large enough that in many cases measurements are now limited by systematic uncertainties rather than random errors .",
    "however , one of the important limitations of the 2qz and sdss surveys are their relative depths . the sdss qso survey is limited to @xmath12 , or @xmath13 for the high redshift sample @xcite , which does not reach the break in the qso luminosity function .",
    "2qz is somewhat deeper , limited in the bluer @xmath14-band to @xmath15 .",
    "the 2qz clearly shows the break in the qso luminosity function ( lf ) , typically reaching @xmath16 mag fainter than the break at @xmath17 .",
    "the observed break in the lf is a gradual flattening towards faint magnitudes ; as a result the constraints from the 2qz on the actual slope of the faint end are fairly uncertain , as evidenced by the difference between the results from the first release ( boyle et al . 2000 ) and the final release ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ; c04 ) . in comparison ,",
    "x - ray surveys , in particular using _ chandra _",
    "( e.g. giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ; alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( e.g. hasinger et al . 2001 ; worsley et al . 2004",
    "; barcons et al . 2007 ) , reach to fainter depths , but over a much smaller area .",
    "the largest samples contain @xmath18 objects over a few square degrees .",
    "these surveys have demonstrated that the pure luminosity evolution that appears to model the evolution of the most extensive optical samples ( e.g. 2qz , sdss ) fails to trace the evolution of the faint agn populations at @xmath19 .",
    "it now appears that the activity in faint agn peaks at a lower redshift than that of more luminous agn ( e.g. hasinger et al 2005 ) ; this process has been described as agn downsizing ( e.g. barger et al . 2005 ) . whether the downsizing is due to lower mass black holes being more active at low redshift ( e.g. heckman et al . 2004 ) or massive black holes at lower rates of accretion ( e.g. babic et al . , 2007 )",
    "remains unclear .",
    "both effects are likely to play a role .",
    "substantial advances have been made in the theoretical understanding of agn formation and the connection to galaxy formation ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "this work has been largely driven by the observational evidence that most massive galaxies with bulges contain super - massive bhs ( smbhs ) ( e.g. tremaine et al . 2002 ) .",
    "smbh accretion is thought to be triggered ( at least for moderate to high luminosity agn ) by the merger of gas rich galaxies ; while the timescale for the merger may be as long as @xmath16gyr , during the majority of this time the accretion is obscured from view .",
    "it is only when the agn finally expels the surrounding gas and dust that it shines like a quasar for a brief period ( @xmath20myr ) , before exhausting its fuel supply ( e.g. di matteo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this feedback of the agn into the host also heats ( and possibly expels ) the gas in the galaxy , which suppresses star formation leading to `` red and dead '' ellipticals or bulges .",
    "these models match a number of previous observations and predict that the faint end of the qso luminosity function is largely comprised of higher mass bhs at lower accretion rates ( i.e. below their peak luminosity ) @xcite .",
    "the 2df sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey was designed to survey optically faint agn / qsos within a sufficiently large volume to obtain robust measurements of both the luminosity function and qso clustering . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the term qso to refer to any broad line ( type 1 ) agn , irrespective of luminosity .",
    "the qso portion of the survey shared fibres with a related program to target luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) at @xmath21 ( cannon et al .",
    "both the lrgs and qsos were selected from single epoch sdss imaging data , and then observed spectroscopically with the 2-degree field ( 2df ) instrument at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the 2slaq qso sample has already produced a preliminary qso luminosity function ( richards et al .",
    "2005 ; r05 ) , measured the clustering of qsos as a function of luminosity ( da angela et al .",
    "2008 ) and studied the distribution of qso broad line widths ( fine et al .",
    "2008 ) . in this paper",
    "we present the final spectroscopic qso catalogue of the 2slaq sample .",
    "we then carry out a detailed analysis of the survey completeness .",
    "the analysis of the qso luminosity function from the final 2slaq sample is presented in a companion paper ( croom et al . in prep ) .    in section [ sec : imaging ] we discuss the selection of qso candidates from the sdss imaging data .",
    "this has largely been described by r05 , but is summarized here for completeness . in section [ sec : spec ]",
    "we present the spectroscopic observations , and in section [ sec : cat ] we describe the composition and quality of the resulting catalogue .",
    "section [ sec : comp ] contains our detailed completeness analysis .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ sec : sum ] . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume a cosmology with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the photometric measurements used as the basis for our catalogue are drawn from the data release 1 ( dr1 ) processing ( stoughton et  al . 2002 ; abazajian et  al .",
    "2003 ) of the sdss imaging data .",
    "the astrometric precision at the faint limit of the survey is @xmath25 arcsec @xcite .",
    "the sdss data are taken in five photometric pass - bands ( @xmath6 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) using a large format ccd camera @xcite on a special - purpose 2.5-m telescope ( gunn et al .",
    "the regions covered by the 2slaq survey were complete in dr1 , so no further updates to more recent data releases are required . except where otherwise stated , all sdss magnitudes discussed herein are `` asinh '' point - spread - function ( psf ) magnitudes @xcite on the sdss pseudo  ab magnitude system @xcite that have been dereddened for galactic extinction according to the model of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the sdss quasar survey @xcite extends to @xmath12 for @xmath26 and @xmath13 for @xmath27 ; our work herein explores the @xmath26 regime to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 , based on the median colours of sdss qsos , e.g. richards et al .",
    "2001 ) . at the faint limit of the 2slaq sample ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "the photometric errors are typically @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "our quasar candidate sample was drawn from 10 sdss imaging runs .",
    "due to the slightly poorer image quality in the 6th row of ccds in the sdss camera we did not include these data .",
    "thus the 2slaq survey regions are @xmath36 wide rather than the usual @xmath37 for an sdss imaging run .",
    "we rejected any objects that met the `` fatal '' or `` non - fatal '' error definitions of the sdss quasar target selection @xcite .",
    "although our survey covers the southern equatorial stripe 82 region which has been scanned multiple times @xcite , the co - added data ( annis et al .",
    "2006 ) were not available at the time of our spectroscopic observations and so single scan data were used .",
    "we apply a limit to the ( extinction corrected ) @xmath38-band psf magnitude of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we also placed restrictions on the errors in each of the other four bands : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that this selection of error constraints effectively limits the redshift to less than 3 , as the ly@xmath45 forest suppresses the @xmath46 flux at higher redshifts .",
    "based on spectroscopic identifications from sdss and 2qz of this initial set of objects , we implement additional colour cuts that are designed to select faint uv - excess qsos with high efficiency and completeness at redshifts @xmath1 .",
    "an analysis of the completeness of the selection algorithm is given as a function of redshift and magnitude in section [ sec : photcomp ] .",
    "we reject hot white dwarfs using the following cuts , independent of magnitude .",
    "specifically , we rejected objects that satisfy the condition : a and ( ( b and c and d ) or e ) , where the letters refer to the cuts : @xmath47 these constraints are similar to the white dwarf cut applied by richards et  al .",
    "( 2002a ; their eq .",
    "2 ) except for the added cut with respect to the @xmath7 colour .    to efficiently target both bright and faint targets we use different colour cuts as a function of @xmath8-band magnitude .",
    "the bright sample is restricted to @xmath48 and is designed to allow for overlap with previous sdss and 2df spectroscopic observations .",
    "the faint sample has @xmath49 and probes roughly one magnitude deeper than 2qz .",
    "these cuts are made in @xmath8 , rather than the @xmath38-band that the sdss quasar survey uses , since we are concentrating on uv - excess quasars and would like to facilitate comparison with the results from the @xmath14-based 2qz .",
    "at this depth an @xmath38-band limited sample selected from single epoch sdss data would also contain substantial stellar contamination .",
    "the combination of the @xmath50 and @xmath39 cuts will exclude objects bluer than @xmath51 ; however , objects this blue are exceedingly rare ( @xmath52 deviations from the observed qso spectral slope distribution ; richards et al 2006 ) . as pointed out by r05 ,",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath8 bands are almost equivalent , with a mean @xmath53 found for qsos in common between the sdss and 2qz .",
    "we note that the relative transmission curves plotted in r05 ( their fig .",
    "6 ) were in error ( the energy to photon conversion was reversed ) .",
    "we plot the correct comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : bjg ] .    in general , we would prefer to avoid a morphology - based cut since we do not want to exclude low-@xmath54 quasars and because our selection extends beyond the magnitude limits at which the sdss s star / galaxy separation breaks down .",
    "however , scranton et  al . ( 2002 ) have developed a bayesian star - galaxy classifier that is robust to @xmath55 . as a result ,",
    "in addition to straight colour - cuts , we also apply some colour restrictions on objects with high @xmath56-band galaxy probability ( referred to below as `` galprob '' ) according to scranton et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) in an attempt to remove contamination from narrow emission line galaxies ( nelgs ; i.e. blue star - forming galaxies ) from our target list .",
    "bright sample objects are those with @xmath48 and that meet the following conditions @xmath57 in the combination a and ( not b ) and ( not c ) and ( not d ) and ( not e ) , where cut a selects uvx objects , cuts b and c eliminate faint f - stars whose metallicity and errors push them blueward into the quasar regime , and cuts d and e remove nelgs that appear extended in the @xmath56 band . among the bright sample objects , those with @xmath58 were given priority in terms of fibre assignment ( see section [ sec : targpri ] ) .",
    "faint sample objects are those with @xmath49 and that meet the following conditions @xmath59 in the combination a and ( not b ) and ( not c ) and ( not d ) and ( not e ) , where cut a selects uvx objects , cuts b , c and d eliminate faint f - stars whose metallicity and errors push them blueward into the quasar regime , and cut e removes nelgs .",
    "these faint cuts are more restrictive than the bright cuts to avoid significant contamination from main sequence stars that will enter the sample as a result of larger errors at fainter magnitudes .",
    "the low redshift colour cuts ( @xmath60 and @xmath7 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ugi_gz ] ( see also fig . 1 of r05 ) .",
    "in addition to the main low redshift ( @xmath1 ) sample described above , we also target a sample of higher redshift qso candidates , analogous to the high redshift sample selected in the main sdss qso survey which selected qsos up to @xmath61 at @xmath62 ( richards et al .",
    "2002a ) . the",
    "2slaq high redshift sample was limited to @xmath63 and an additional constraint that @xmath64 was applied to the @xmath54-band photometry .",
    "we then selected candidates in three redshift intervals .",
    "qso candidates at redshift @xmath65 satisfied the following cuts : @xmath66 for the redshift range @xmath67 this selection becomes @xmath68 in the combination a and b and c and d and e. for the redshifts above @xmath69 we use @xmath70 these samples have a high degree of contamination from the stellar locus due to photometric errors .",
    "these candidates were therefore targeted at a lower priority than the main low redshift sample , and we do not present a detailed analysis of completeness for the high redshift sample ."
