    "there are several motivations for studying the time - variable characteristics of pn central stars ( cspn ) : chandra and xmm - newton observations are providing new perspectives on the presence of hot bubbles in planetary nebulae formed from the interaction between central star fast winds and the ambient asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase gas ( e.g. kastner et al .",
    "the origin of the x - ray emission remains uncertain , as does the consequence of a potentially spatially clumped central star fast wind .",
    "we have previously reported on far - uv _ fuse _ satellite spectroscopic time - series observations of ngc  6543 ( prinja et al .",
    "2007 ) ; there we demonstrated in particular the incidence of coherent , systematically evolving structures in the fast wind of the h - rich central star .",
    "the empirical characteristics derived by prinja et al .",
    "( 2007 ) are clearly comparable to the signatures of large - scale structure in clumped radiation pressure - driven winds of ob stars .",
    "the post - agb mass - loss via a fast wind is important not only because of its dynamical interaction with the nebula , but also due to its effect on the evolution of the central star .",
    "an improved understanding of the variable nature of cspn spectral line profiles is also important in studying binarity in these objects , and thus post - common envelope evolution . in this case",
    "recorded photometric and spectroscopic signatures may be complicated by the influence of , for example , variable photospheric structure and an inhomogeneous inner stellar wind region ( see e.g. de marco et al .",
    "furthermore , complex changes in diagnostic spectral lines can impact on non - lte model atmosphere analyses aimed at deriving fundamental parameters of cspn , including revisions to mass - loss rates due to strongly clumped outflows ( e.g. kudritzki , urbaneja & puls 2006 ; urbaneja et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "though the uv resonance lines are undoubtedly the most appropriate for probing cspn fast winds ( e.g. perinotto 1987 ) , there is unfortunately a dearth of suitable uv _ time - series _ datasets ( _ iue _ , _ fuse _ , or _",
    "hst _ ) currently available for these objects .",
    "we explore in this paper therefore the alternative of exploiting optical time - series data that offer diagnostics of variable conditions in , both , the fast wind and close to the stellar surface .",
    "we focus in this respect on high - quality _ eso _ optical data of the young h - rich central star he  2@xmath0138 .",
    "this paper reports on optical time - series and archival uv data of the central star of he  2 - 138 ( pk  320 - 09 1 ) .",
    "the central star provides an interesting balance in that ( i ) its fast wind reveals intermediate strength , unsaturated uv resonance lines , ( ii ) the weaker optical photospheric lines are very symmetric and likely not contaminated by wind effects , and ( iii ) the wind densities at low velocities are high enough to provide some optical signatures of the outflow .",
    "the nebula itself has a complex knotted appearance , with bubble - like structures arranged in fairly symmetrical form , providing an overall elliptical morphology ( see e.g. the hst wfpc2 h@xmath1 imaging survey of sahai & trauger 1998 ) .",
    "there is no recent published model atmosphere analysis of the central star , though a non - lte study deriving a few basic parameters is given by mendez et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ; adopted parameters are listed in table  1 and include values derived from a new non - lte analyses carried out during our present study of he 2 - 138 .",
    ".he  2 - 138 central star parameters . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in fig .",
    "5 , our final model ( table 3 ) reproduces well most of the features present in the fuv / uv spectrum .",
    "however , the model does not match the wide absorption troughs observed in the si  iv and c   iv uv profiles , and it under - predicts the strength of the al  iii lines .",
    "low ionization species present in the uv range , such as c  ii and al  iii will require a lower ( significantly lower in the case of the c features ) effective temperature , but will then not reproduce the observed he  i / ii ionization balance . similarly , high ionization features present in the optical spectrum ( o  iii and c  iv lines ) would require a higher effective temperature , that again would not be consistent with the he ionization balance .",
    "we noted the same discrepancy in the sei modelling earlier ( fig .",
    "4 ) , where a two component wind was invoked and @xmath2 = 750 km s@xmath3 used for the c  iv and si  iv _ iue _ lines . note that the _ hst _ stis spectrum of civ modelled in sect .",
    "3.1 ( fig .",
    "4 ) was secured in 2004 june and is broadly similar to the _ iue _ high - resolution line profile taken in 1989 may .",
    "the maximum epoch to epoch change evident in the archival data is @xmath4 100 km s@xmath3 in the shallow blueward wing .",
    "the variation is thus not sufficient to account for the two component behaviour discussed above .",
    "overall , the unusual nature of the wind lines in he 2 - 138 is borne out by our comparisons to the model line profiles for spherically symmetric winds .",
    "we believe that the dichotomy in matching low and high ion lines , including discrepancies ( with respect to symmetric models ) in the relative absorption and emission strengths of the p cygni profiles , argue in favour of a wind whose terminal velocity and mass - loss have a latitude dependence .",
    "low velocity , low ion species would form primarily in the cooler equatorial regions of an asymmetric outflow that is viewed almost pole - on .",
    "the high speed siiv and civ bearing gas is then driven out mostly in the hotter polar regions of the flow .",
    "this notion of a two - component , asymmetric wind in he 2 - 138 is discussed further in sect . 5    for a @xmath2 of 300 km s@xmath3 , @xmath5 = 29000 k , adopted central star mass of @xmath4 0.6 m@xmath6 and a log ( l / l@xmath6 ) @xmath4 3.9 , the model in fig . 5",
    "yields a mass - loss ( wind strength ) parameter log q @xmath4 @xmath011.45 dex ( where q = @xmath7(r@xmath8@xmath9)@xmath10 ) and thus a mass - loss rate of @xmath4 1.2 @xmath11 10@xmath12 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 . the adopted model is for a smooth wind and any clumping is unconstrained here , but it is noted as being at a very low degree .",
    "the corresponding wind momentum value log ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath4 26.6 dex sits within the scatter in the wind - momentum luminosity relation observed for cspn and predicted by the line - driven wind theory ( see e.g. kudritzki , urbaneja & puls , 2006 ) .",
    "though these authors note that in the luminosity regime restricted to cspn ( and excluding luminous o - type stars ) , there is no convincing relation between wind momentum and luminosity .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result from the _ ab initio _ cmfgen prediction to the empirical , sei - derived @xmath14 results presented earlier .",
    "for a mass - loss rate of @xmath4 1.2 @xmath11 10@xmath12 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 , the corresponding mean ion fractions based on the sei profile fits ( fig .",
    "4 ) are also listed in table 2 .",
    "the empirical analyses would suggest therefore that none of these strongly absorptive ions are dominant in the outflow of he 2 - 138 .",
    "we note however that the cmfgen base model ( table 3 ) predicts ( for smooth or weakly clumped winds ) that the s@xmath15 and si@xmath15 ionization fractions are dominant in the wind ( i.e. @xmath4 90% ) .",
    "this disparity would suggest that either the cmfgen derived mass - loss rate is overestimated or the sei product of @xmath16 is underestimated .",

    "the time - dependent nature of the central star wind in he  2 - 138 is discussed here , based primarily on the eso time - series data of the p  cygni - like hei @xmath175876 feature ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we also comment on additional changes noted in the deep - seated , photospheric dominated , optical lines due to hei and civ @xmath175801 .",
    "unfortunately there is no appropriate fuv or uv time - series dataset currently available for he  2 - 138 .",
    "we examined the fragmented sample of 12 _ fuse _ ( lwrs ) spectra present in the archive , covering epochs in 1999 september , 2000 march , 2000 july , 2002 april , 2007 february and 2007 april .",
    "there is no evidence for substantial blueward variability in for example the siv , pv or ciii lines .",
    "the maximum discernible change is a @xmath4 60 km s@xmath3 shift in the blue wing of siv@xmath171073.5 .        , he i @xmath174471 and c iv @xmath175801 lines .",
    "the grayscale images show temporal changes in individual spectra normalised by the mean profile shown at the bottom for each line .",
    "the dynamical range shown is 0.96 ( black ) to 1.05 ( white ) .",
    "the middle panels for each line provide the variance statistic , where we highlight changes above the 95% significance level ( dotted line ) .",
    "unambiguous evidence for changes in the central star wind comes from the hei @xmath175876 line .",
    "the sequence of 18 spectra secured over @xmath4 2.2 days is shown in fig . 6 .",
    "the absorption trough is variable out to @xmath4 200 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the equivalent widths vary between @xmath4 0.37 to 0.65 and @xmath4 0.47 to 0.8 , for the absorption and emission components , respectively .",
    "these changes are correlated such that the deepest absorption troughs are accompanied by the strongest emission components . at its greatest ,",
    "the absorption and emission equivalent widths of the profile can increase ( in concert ) by @xmath4 60% .",
    "the temporal characteristics of hei @xmath175876 line profile are explored further in fig .",
    "7 , together with the properties of the photospheric dominated absorption lines of hei @xmath174026 , hei @xmath174471 , and civ @xmath175801 .",
    "the temporal variance spectrum ( tvs ; e.g. fullerton et al .",
    "1996 ) indicates a slight blueward asymmetry in the profile changes of hei @xmath175876 at the 95% significance level .",
    "a strong absorption enhancement is evident during the second night of observations , extending to @xmath4 200 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these data are not intensive enough to conclude whether this is an episodic migrating feature akin to the discrete absorption components ( dacs ) seen generally in the uv spectra of ob stars and also reported in the _ fuse _ data of ngc  6543 by prinja et al .",
    "the weaker photospheric lines are also undoubtedly variable on hourly time - scales and the grayscale representations in fig .",
    "7 reveal similar systematic changes in each of three lines considered .",
    "the equivalent widths of the photospheric lines are not conserved , and we measure changes of up to @xmath4 25% in the hei @xmath174471 and hei @xmath174026 spectra",
    ". these variations do not correlate with the blueward or redward fluctuations of the hei @xmath175876 p  cygni profile .",
    "the same is true for the very weak and narrow si iii @xmath184552 , 4567 and 4574 triplet shown in fig .",
    "1 , which exhibits @xmath4 hourly changes that mimic those of hei @xmath174471 and hei @xmath174026 . we conclude that temporal changes in the central star wind are not evident in the deep - seated regions close to the photosphere and likely arise further out in the outflow , where they are diagnosed via hei @xmath175876 .    in fig .",
    "7 , the data of photospheric lines , which are shown as residuals from the mean profiles , reveal blue to red travelling pseudo - absorption and pseudo - emission features in the dynamical spectra .",
    "this behaviour may be indicative of the presence of prograde non - radial pulsations of the photosphere .",
    "the variability pattern is similar from night to night . in each of the photospheric lines",
    "the redward variance ( tvs ) is stronger than the blueward tvs , and this asymmetry is marked by a drop in variance at rest velocity .",
    "the blue - to - red features migrate across the full span of the absorption trough over an estimated @xmath4 0.3 to 0.4 days .",
    "the empirical changes in the near - surface lines of e.g. hei @xmath174471 , hei @xmath174026 and civ @xmath175801 are characterised by localised structure in the absorption troughs as opposed to whole - scale radial velocity shifts about line centre .",
    "these sub - features can have the effect of extending either the blue or red wing of the profile , while the other wing stays constant . in",
    "extreme the features can results in a @xmath4 25% change in equivalent width .",
    "note that though the variations in hei @xmath174471 and hei @xmath174026 ( and other similar features in the optical spectrum of he 2 - 138 ) extend to more that @xmath19 100 km s@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "7 ) , the basic pattern of changes is the same as that evident in civ @xmath175801 , which is a much narrower line ( closer to @xmath19 projected rotation velocity ) and likely forms very close to or at the photosphere .    with the caveat that our time - series dataset of he 2 - 138 is sparse",
    ", we conducted a periodogram analysis to search for evidence of cyclic behaviour in the hei @xmath174026 and hei @xmath174471 lines . the frequency range sampled by the data from @xmath4 0.5 days@xmath3 to 10 days@xmath3",
    "was examined for periods by employing the clean algorithm described by roberts et al .",
    "( 1987 ) . following an iterative deconvolution of the ( strong ) window function for our dataset ,",
    "the only potentially significant peaks in the resulting power spectra are aliases of each other at @xmath4 1.4 d@xmath3 and 2.8 d@xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "we estimate a @xmath4 30% uncertainty in these frequencies based on the widths of the power spectra features . the shorter corresponding period , i.e. 0.36 days , is repeated over more than six cycles during the full span of the observing run .",
    "grayscale representations of the 18 individual quotient ( with respect to the mean ) line profiles are shown phased on the 0.36 day period in fig .",
    "9 ( folded over 2 cycles ) . the hei @xmath174026 and hei @xmath174471 lines clearly show some coherency in the travelling features over the 0.36 day time - scale .",
    "in contrast the outflow dominated hei @xmath175876 profile is more fragmented in the phased plots and there is certainly no evidence that the outflow changes are modulated on this time - scale .",
    "the detection of a residual variability pattern in figs . 7 and 9 that extends to velocities higher than the mooted projected rotation velocity may be interpreted in terms of the wave - leakage mechanism , which permits pulsations to initiate perturbations in the deepest stellar wind regions .",
    "for example , cranmer ( 1996 ) and towsend ( 2000 ) argue that pulsations arising in the stellar interior can migrate toward the outer atmospheric layers as high frequency gas pressure ( p mode ) waves or as lower frequency ( g mode ) waves .",
    "the notion of wave - leakage in he 2 - 138 would be consistent with our conclusion in sect .",
    "3.1 that the central star has a very dense wind , thus in effect there is no clear boundary at which pulsations get reflected and confined .",
    "we have revealed that he 2 - 138 has a dense , slowly accelerating central star wind , that is variable on time - scales of hours to days .",
    "the sei and cmfgen line synthesis models presented here support the notion that he 2 - 138 exhibits a two - component outflow : a hotter ( i.e @xmath20 29,000 k ) component provides a better match to the ( near ) photosheric civ and oiii optical lines , but predicts too much heii and hence less hei .",
    "in contrast cooler models ( @xmath4 25,000 k ) reproduce better the low - ionization uv lines ( including cii and aliii ) , but these models predict too much photospheric hei and too weak heii lines .",
    "additionally , the spherically symmetric sei and cmfgen models can not reproduce the observed relative absorption and emission strengths of the siiv @xmath181400 , civ @xmath181550 , and mgii @xmath182800 p cygni profiles .",
    "this discordance may be interpreted to suggest that the outflow is asymmetric .",
    "while the uv siv @xmath171073 line is ( a lower abundance ) surrogate to siiv in the range of ionization potential , its line profile can only be matched by adopting a maximum wind velocity of 300 km s@xmath3 , while a higher velocity of 750 km s@xmath3 is needed for siiv @xmath181400 ( and civ @xmath181550 ) .",
    "though the spectral lines we considered have been secured at different epochs ( for _ eso _ , _ iue _ , _ hst _ , and _ fuse _ data ) , multiple archival fuv and uv spectra spanning several years do not provide any indication that the shortward wings of the wind lines are variable by several 100 km s@xmath3 .",
    "4026 ( solid line ) and hei @xmath174471 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the strongest peaks correspond to ( alias ) signals at @xmath4 0.36 days and 0.72 days . ]",
    "an analogous example of a hybrid wind may be that of b[e ] stars , where a two - component stellar wind model has been proposed ( e.g. zickgraf et al . 1985 ) . in this scenario",
    "a hotter and faster polar wind gives rise to more extended high - excitation absorption features , and in contrast a slowly accelerating cooler equatorial disk wind promotes narrower low - excitation lines .",
    "extremely slow ( less than 100 km s@xmath3 ) disk winds can then be seen in b[e ] stars viewed edge on .",
    "the increasing maximum outflow velocity in he 2 - 138 from aliii to siv , and to siiv and civ may reflect the spatial distribution of these ions in a hypothesised latitude dependent outflow viewed approximately pole - on .",
    "one inconsistency in comparison to b[e ] star - type hybrid winds is that the nv @xmath181240 doublet would in this scenario be expected to be strongly in emission .",
    "this resonance line is however absent in _ iue _ spectra of he 2 - 138 , and since _ fuse _ data _ do _ reveal the presence of niii @xmath17955 , we do not anticipate a strong n abundance anomaly .",
    "the absence of nv may instead reflect a general lack of shocked x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the ovi @xmath181032 , 1038 doublet is also not present .",
    "n@xmath21 is then expected to be a dominant ionisation stage in the wind .",
    "in addition to a proposed non - spherical outflow in he  2 - 138 , our analyses also provides indications of some dichotomy in the photospheric lines ( see above ) .",
    "one possibility is that the central star is a rapid rotator , and we are indeed viewing it almost pole on ( i.e. at a smaller projected velocity ) .",
    "the rapid rotation distorts the surface layers sufficiently such that we view a hotter polar region and cooler equatorial surface .        and",
    "hei @xmath175876 quotient spectra are shown phased over 2 cycles on a period of 0.36 days .",
    "evidence for asymmetries in the central star wind of a very young pn such as he 2 - 138 is interesting in connection to the wider debate as to the origin of commonly seen , non - spherical nebulae , many of which reveal axi- and point - symmetries . for example , the higher mass - loss super - wind that marks the end of the agb phase may be highly asymmetric , and in the interacting stellar wind model could result in a non - spherical nebula .",
    "the young nebula of he 2 - 138 is undoubtedly complex ( e.g. sahai & trauger 1998 ) and suggestive of strongly collimated post - agb mass - loss .",
    "the morphology of the low and high ion uv lines presented here also points to an asymmetry in the subsequent central star wind .",
    "the cause of this asymmetry remains uncertain .",
    "the role of subsurface convection and a sustained agb magnetic dynamo has been studied previously in the context of bipolar pn shapes ( e.g. blackmann et al .",
    "2001 ; nordhaus et al .",
    "the combination of rotation and a long - term large - scale magnetic field might then lead to an equatorially enhanced super - wind . indeed",
    "our notion that the central star in he 2 - 138 may be a rapid rotator would be consistent with the simulations of e.g. dwarkadas ( 2004 ) , who reported that fast rotation of the central star can lead to non - spherical mass - loss . in the early stages of the nebular evolution the aspherical mass - loss could then result in a bipolar wind - blown bubble .",
    "an alternative scenario is that binarity is the cause of the non - spherical planetary nebulae .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic radial velocity surveys have suggested that at least @xmath4 15% of pn central stars are in short period ( less than 3 days ) close binaries ( e.g. bond 2000 ; de marco et al .",
    "unambiguous spectroscopic confirmation of central star binaries has been difficult to achieve and in many cases the fluctuations of deep - seated spectral lines appear to be erratic and not cyclic on a clear period ( e.g. de marco et al .",
    "2008 ) . in our study of he 2 - 138 the photospheric hei and metal lines are also variable , but they do not exhibit the tell - tale sinusoidal pattern in radial velocity shifts .",
    "we argue here instead that at least the @xmath4 hourly temporal changes evident in the photospheric lines of he 2 - 138 are more reliably interpreted as blue - to - red migrating features in the absorption profiles , which may provide tentative evidence for photospheric velocity fields and wave - leakage due to prograde non - radial pulsations .",
    "we would not assign the changes seen in e.g. hei @xmath174026 , hei @xmath174471 , and civ @xmath175801 as due to the effects of a variable central star _",
    "wind_. in he 2 - 138 the outflow is only diagnosed in our data via the p  cygni - like profiles of hei @xmath175876 and the fuv and uv resonance lines .    unravelling the occurrence of central star binarity and photospheric structures (",
    "pulsational or magnetic ) demands intensive time - series over several days .",
    "these requisites are observationally challenging to secure , particularly as multi - site observations may also been needed in order to provide sufficiently continuous monitoring .",
    "however , we have demonstrated in this study of he 2 - 138 that it may be rewarding to conduct an extensive comparative study of the morphologies of the uv fast wind lines of young pn central stars , with the goal of investigating in time - averaged ( archival ) data the evidence for non - spherical outflows .",
    "these signatures may be relics of the structure of the preceding post - agb super - wind phase .",
    "we are grateful for the support of staff at the european southern observatory , la silla , chile .",
    "thanks also to adam burnley for his support of the eso observing run .",
