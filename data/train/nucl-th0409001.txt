    "recently , an exotic baryon @xmath0 was discovered firstly by leps group at spring-8 in the reaction @xmath2@xcite , and was subsequently observed by many other groups@xcite .",
    "it has @xmath3 quantum numbers(b=+1 , q=+1 , s=+1 ) , and its minimal quark content must be @xmath4 .",
    "the remarkable features of the @xmath0 are its small mass ( 1540mev ) and very narrow width ( @xmath525mev)@xcite . while the isospin of @xmath0 is probably zero@xcite , the other quantum numbers including spin and parity have not been measured experimentally yet . theoretically , most of the works considers @xmath0 as a @xmath6 particle because of its low mass@xcite , and some predict positive parity@xcite and some suggest negative parity@xcite .    the search for the pentaquark @xmath0 is also extended to the experiment of relativistic heavy ion collisions where the extreme condition to form a new state of matter  quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) can be reached .",
    "the star collaboration@xcite reported the progress of the pentaquark search in @xmath7 and @xmath8 collisions at energy @xmath9 gev , and the phenix collaboration@xcite investigated the decay of the anti - pentaquark @xmath10 .",
    "theoretically , the baryon density modification@xcite on the @xmath0 mass was discussed with a phenomenological density - dependent nucleon propagator@xcite , and the @xmath0 production in relativistic heavy ion collisions was studied in the coalescence model@xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that there are two qcd phase transitions in hot and dense nuclear matter .",
    "one of them is related to the deconfinement process in moving from a hadron gas to qgp , and the other one describes the transition from the chiral symmetry breaking phase to the phase in which it is restored . from the qcd lattice simulations@xcite , the phase transitions are of first order in high density region and may be only a crossover in high temperature region . as the order parameter of chiral phase transition , the dynamic quark mass , or",
    "the nucleon mass reflects the characteristics of chiral symmetry restoration , and will influence the pentaquark decay process @xmath11 . in this letter",
    ", we investigate the effect of chiral phase transition on the pentaquark @xmath0 mass and width at finite temperature and density at one - loop level of @xmath12 coupling .",
    "if the mass and width shifts induced by the chiral symmetry restoration are sensitive to the pentaquark parity , it may help us to solve the puzzle of @xmath0 parity .",
    "we proceed as follows . in section 2",
    ", we calculate the self - energy of @xmath0 at finite temperature and density at one - loop level of pseudovector and pseudoscalar @xmath12 couplings with positive and negative @xmath0 parity , and obtain the @xmath0 mass shift and width shift in the medium .",
    "the medium dependence of the nucleon mass is determined through the mean field gap equation of the njl model@xcite which is one of the models to see directly how the dynamical mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration operate . in section 3",
    ", we show the numerical calculations , analyze the contribution of chiral symmetry restoration to the mass and width shifts , and discuss the parity dependence of the results .",
    "finally , we give our summary .",
    "we introduce the effective lagrangians for the pseudovector and pseudoscalar @xmath12 couplings@xcite , @xmath13 here , the positive parity of @xmath0 is assumed . the effective lagrangians with assuming negative parity of @xmath0",
    "can be obtained by removing @xmath14 in the vertexes .",
    "the pseudovector and pseudoscalar coupling constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fixed to reproduce the mass @xmath17 and decay width @xmath18 mev at zero temperature and zero density@xcite . through the calculation at tree level one",
    "has @xmath19 and @xmath20 for positive parity and @xmath21 and @xmath22 for negative parity@xcite .",
    "we calculate the in - medium @xmath0 self - energy by perturbation method above mean field . to the lowest order",
    ", it is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the propagators of nucleon and kaon at mean field level read , @xmath23 where the four - momentum @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 with baryon chemical potential @xmath26 .",
    "the mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and density is embedded in our calculation through the effective nucleon mass @xmath27 . since the calculation of @xmath27 is nonperturbative ,",
    "it is difficult to calculate it directly with qcd , one has to use models .",
    "while the quantitative result depends on the models used , the qualitative temperature and density behavior is not sensitive to the details of different chiral models@xcite .",
    "a simple model to describe chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum and symmetry restoration in medium is the njl model@xcite . within this model , on",
    "can obtain the hadronic mass spectrum and the static properties of mesons remarkably well .",
    "in particular , one can recover the goldstone mode , and some important low - energy properties of current algebra such as the goldberger - treiman and gellmann - oakes - renner relations@xcite .",
    "in mean field approximation of njl , the effective nucleon mass can be determined through the gap equation@xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the constituent quark energy , the current quark mass @xmath30 , the color and flavor degrees of freedom @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the coupling constant @xmath33 and the momentum cutoff @xmath34 are chosen to fit the nucleon and pion properties in the vacuum@xcite .",
    "the numerical results of temperature and chemical potential dependent nucleon mass are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the effective nucleon mass drops down continuously with increasing temperature and approaches finally three times the current quark mass @xmath30 . very different from the temperature effect ,",
    "the nucleon mass jumps down at a critical chemical potential @xmath35 , which means a first - order chiral phase transition in high baryon density region .",
    "these different temperature and density effects will be reflected in the @xmath0 mass and width shifts . considering the near cancellation of attractive scalar and repulsive vector potential ,",
    "the @xmath36 mass increases slightly with temperature and density@xcite . to simplify the calculation",

    "the @xmath0 self - energy can be separated into a scalar and a vector part , @xmath38 with which the propagator of @xmath0 reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath0 mass in vacuum .",
    "the @xmath0 complex mass @xmath41 in the medium can be determined by the pole equation of the propagator , @xmath42\\bigg|_{p'_0=\\sqrt{{\\cal m}_\\theta^2+{\\bf p}^2 } } = 0\\ .\\ ] ] from this equation , one can obtain the temperature , chemical potential , and momentum dependence of the @xmath0 mass and width .    in the rest frame of @xmath0 , @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ", the calculation can be done more easily .",
    "since the width of @xmath0 is very small compared to its mass(we assume that this statement holds both in vacuum and in medium ) , the eq.([cmass ] ) can be separated into two uncoupled equations .",
    "the pentaquark mass @xmath45 at finite temperature and density is calculated through the gap equation @xmath46 and the medium correction to the pentaquark width @xmath47 is determined by @xmath48    for the pseudovector coupling with positive parity , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the loop 4-momentum carried by the nucleon .",
    "taking the transformations @xmath51 and @xmath52 in imaginary time formulism of finite temperature field theory , we can obtain the explicit expression of @xmath0 self - energy at finite temperature and density , where @xmath53 with @xmath54 is the fermion frequency .",

    "we will see in the following that this change in sign leads to a partial cancellation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 in determining the in - medium @xmath0 mass and width , and results in small mass and width shifts for negative - parity @xmath0 .",
    "with the formulas given in last section , we now calculate numerically the @xmath0 mass shift @xmath68 and the width shift @xmath69 at finite temperature and density for the pseudovector ( pv ) and pseudoscalar ( ps ) couplings with positive and negative @xmath0 parity .",
    "we call these four couplings in the following @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "we first consider the mass shift . from its temperature dependence at fixed chemical potentials ( figs.[fig3]a and b ) and chemical potential dependence at fixed temperatures ( figs.[fig3]c and d ) ,",
    "it has the following properties : + 1)the @xmath0 becomes light in the medium , like most of the hadrons such as nucleon , @xmath71 meson and @xmath72 meson characterized by chiral symmetry .",
    "while for the couplings @xmath73 and @xmath74 the mass shift by pure temperature effect is rather small , see fig.[fig3]a , it becomes remarkable in the case with high baryon density and high temperature , see figs.[fig3]b - d .",
    "+ 2 ) the temperature and density dependence of the mass shift is controlled by the chiral properties . in the case of pure temperature effect ( fig.[fig3]a ) and",
    "the case of high temperature and high density effect ( figs.[fig3]b and d ) , the continuous chiral phase transition , shown in fig.[fig2]a for @xmath75 , results in a smooth mass shift . in the case of high density but low temperature , the mass shift is zero in the chiral breaking phase at @xmath76 , changes suddenly at the phase transition with @xmath77 , and decreases rapidly in the chiral restoration phase with @xmath78 , see fig.[fig4]c .",
    "this behavior reflects the properties of first - order chiral phase transition shown in fig.[fig2]b .",
    "+ 3 ) the degree of the @xmath0 mass change depends strongly on its parity . in any case of temperature and density , the mass shift of positive - parity @xmath0 is much larger than that of negative - parity one .",
    "for instance , at @xmath79 mev and @xmath80 mev , the mass shifts for the couplings @xmath81 and @xmath82 are , respectively , @xmath83 and @xmath84 mev .     ( a ) and @xmath85 ( b ) and the chemical potential dependence at fixed temperatures @xmath86 ( c ) and @xmath87 ( d ) of the @xmath0 mass shift for four different couplings . ]",
    "we turn to the discussion of the @xmath0 width shift .",
    "it is indicated as a function of temperature at fixed chemical potentials ( figs.[fig4]a and b ) and a function of chemical potential at fixed temperatures ( fig.[fig4]c and d ) for the four different couplings .",
    "related to the properties of the mass shift , the width has the characteristics : + 1 ) like most of the hadrons in medium , the suppressed mass leads to @xmath0 broadening at finite temperature and density .",
    "the pentaquark will become more and more unstable with increasing temperature and density , and easy to decay in relativistic heavy ion collisions if it is created .",
    "+ 2 ) again , the behavior of the width shift is dominated by the chiral properties",
    ". the width increases continuously in the case of pure temperature effect and the case of high density and high temperature , but starts to jump up suddenly at the critical chemical potential @xmath35 in the case of high density but low temperature , resulted from the chiral phase transition shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "+ 3 ) the broadening depends also on the @xmath0 parity . in any case",
    "the broadening of positive - parity @xmath0 is much larger than that of negative - parity one .",
    "+ 4 ) compared with the vacuum mass and width ( 1540 mev and 15 mev in our calculation ) , the mass shift is slight , but the width shift is extremely strong . from fig.[fig3 ] the maximum mass shift in the considered temperature and density region is @xmath88 of the vacuum value for the coupling @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the coupling @xmath74 .",
    "however , from the fig.[fig4 ] the maximum width shift is 17 times the vacuum value for @xmath89 and 7 times for @xmath74 !     ( a ) and @xmath85 ( b ) and the chemical potential dependence at fixed temperatures @xmath86 ( c ) and @xmath87 ( c ) of the @xmath0 width shift for four different couplings . ]    to study the pentaquark production in relativistic heavy ion collisions , we estimate the @xmath0 mass and width shifts at rhic , sps and sis , shown in tab.i .",
    "we take the corresponding temperature and baryon chemical potential at rhic , sps and sis as @xmath91 and @xmath92 mev , respectively . while the mass shift can be neglected in any case , the width shift for positive - parity @xmath0 at sps and sis is important and measurable . compared with the width shift in the vacuum , it goes up form @xmath93 at rhic to @xmath94 at sps and to @xmath95 at sis for the coupling @xmath74 , and from @xmath96 at rhic to @xmath97 at sps and to @xmath98 at sis for the coupling @xmath89 !

    "one is the chiral symmetry restoration reflected in the effective nucleon mass , and the other one is the loop frequency summation in fig.[fig1 ] . to make sure that the remarkable mass shift and the crucial width shift are induced mainly by the chiral properties , we now turn off the way of chiral phase transition and keep the nucleon mass as the vacuum value @xmath103 during the numerical calculation .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "compared with the calculation with chiral symmetry restoration , at zero chemical potential the maximum mass shift is reduced from -20 mev ( fig.[fig3]a ) to -10 mev ( fig.[fig5]a ) , and the maximum width shift is strongly suppressed from 9 mev ( fig.[fig4]a ) to -1 mev ( fig.[fig5]b ) . qualitatively different from the case with chiral symmetry restoration ,",
    "the @xmath0 becomes narrow in the case without chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "it is easy to see that the considerable mass shift , especially the extreme width shift are originated from the mechanism of chiral phase transition .",
    "mass shift ( a ) and width shift ( b ) with a constant nucleon mass for four different couplings . ]",
    "we studied the temperature and density effect on the pentaquark mass and width to the lowest order of the perturbation expansion above chiral mean field for four different @xmath12 couplings .",
    "the chiral phase transition , here reflected in the effective nucleon mass , plays an essential rule in determining the in - medium @xmath0 mass and width shifts . like",
    "most of the hadrons , the @xmath0 becomes light and unstable in high temperature and density region where the chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the degree of the mass and width shifts depends strongly on the @xmath0 parity . for positive - parity @xmath0 ,",
    "the maximum width shift in reasonable temperature and density region is 17 times its vacuum value for pseudoscalar coupling , and 7 times for pseudovector coupling , while for negative - parity @xmath0 , the width shift is much smaller .",
    "this parity dependence may be helpful to determine the pentaquark parity in relativistic heavy ion collisions . at sis energy ,",
    "the width shift is almost 4 - 8 times the vacuum value for positive - parity @xmath0 .",
    "when the chiral symmetry restoration is removed from the calculation , the pure temperature and density effect resulted from the thermal loop on the mass and width becomes rather small .",
