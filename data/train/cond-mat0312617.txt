    "a central concept in the theory of phase transitions is that of the ` order parameter ' , which expresses the different symmetries of the phases on either side of the critical point . if the transition is second order , there is interesting universal singular behavior that is manifested in many physical quantities . according to the prevalent paradigm largely due to landau and ginzburg@xcite ,",
    "these universal critical singularities are associated with long wavelength low energy fluctuations of the order parameter degree of freedom . when combined with general renormalization group ideas",
    "@xcite , this notion provides the sophisticated landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theoretical framework for thinking about critical phenomena in various diverse contexts .",
    "specifically , static critical properties at non - zero temperature are supposed to be determined from effective models in which all modes other than the order parameter have been eliminated . similarly , for dynamical critical properties ,",
    "the only degrees of freedom that purportedly need be retained are the order parameter and at most a few additional `` hydrodynamic '' modes having slow relaxation times due to conservation laws .",
    "recent years have seen much interest in the study of zero temperature phase transition phenomena in correlated many body systems . unlike their thermal counterpart , such transitions are often driven by quantum fluctuation effects and are hence known as ` quantum phase transitions'@xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been proposed that proximity to quantum critical points ( qcps ) separating two distinct phases is responsible for the anomalous properties of some interesting correlated materials such as , for instance , the cuprate superconductors .",
    "theoretically , the lgw paradigm has thus far provided the basic framework to examine quantum critical phenomena as well . in particular , the critical modes specific to a quantum critical point are presumed to be the long distance , long time fluctuations of the order parameter , described in a continuum field theory .    in the last few years some interesting and tantalizing evidence has emerged that points toward the failure of the lgw paradigm at certain quantum phase transitions .",
    "first , there are numerical calculations @xcite that see a direct second order quantum phase transition between two phases with different broken symmetry characterized by two apparently independent order parameters .",
    "a lgw description of the competition between such two kinds of orders would then generically predict either a first - order transition , or an intermediate region of coexistence where both orders simultaneously exist , or an intermediate region with neither order .",
    "a direct second order transition between these two broken symmetry phases would seem to require fine - tuning to a ` multicritical ' point .",
    "are the numerics managing to achieve this ` fine - tuning ' or is the lgw paradigm simply invalid ?",
    "second , there have been a number of fascinating experiments probing the onset of magnetic long range order in a class of rare - earth inter - metallics known as the heavy fermion metals @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the behavior right at the quantum transition between the magnetic and non - magnetic metallic phases is usually very different from that of a fermi liquid .",
    "furthermore , such behavior is in severe disagreement with expectations based on lgw analyses .",
    "specifically , theories associating the critical singularities with fluctuations of the natural magnetic order parameter in a metallic environment seem to have a hard time explaining the observed non - fermi liquid phenomena .",
    "once again it appears that more than the obvious possibly happens at some quantum critical points .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate and study various specific examples of quantum phase transitions which violate the lgw paradigm . we will show that in a number of different quantum transitions , the natural field theoretic description of the critical singularities is not in terms of the order parameter field(s ) that describe the bulk phases but in terms of some new ` emergent ' degrees of freedom that are specific to the critical point .",
    "these new degrees of freedom may be thought of ` fractional ' quantum number particles that interact with each other through an emergent gauge force in a sense made precise below .",
    "laughlin has previously argued for fractionalization at quantum critical points on phenomenological grounds @xcite . a non - technical overview of our results has appeared previously.@xcite    we note , in passing , that there are already numerous well - documented examples of the breakdown of the lgw paradigm in quantum systems in one dimension.@xcite however , these rely rather crucially on the description of various states in terms of the harmonic phase degrees of freedom of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid , and do not have any direct generalization to higher dimensions .    for the most part in this paper , we will study phase transitions in two dimensional quantum magnetism .",
    "these may also be fruitfully viewed from a different point of view as representing transitions of interacting bosons on a lattice at commensurate density .",
    "quantum magnets provide a particularly useful laboratory to develop and test ideas on the theory of quantum phase transitions .",
    "consider a quantum system of spin @xmath2 moments @xmath3 on a two dimensional square lattice ( @xmath4 ) with the hamiltonian @xmath5 the ellipses represent other short ranged interactions that may be tuned to drive various zero temperature phase transitions .",
    "we assume @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e _ antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "later we will consider various generalizations to other lattices , higher spins , etc .",
    "antiferromagnet studied in this paper .",
    "the coupling @xmath7 controls the strength of quantum spin fluctuations about a magnetically ordered state , and appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlsm ] ) ( the classical limit is @xmath8 ) .",
    "there is broken spin rotation invariance in the nel state for @xmath9 , described by the order parameter @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : staggered ] ) .",
    "the vbs ground state appears for @xmath11 , and is characterized by the order parameter @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbsorder ] )  the distinct lines represent distinct values of @xmath13 on each link .",
    "the vbs state on the left has `` columnar '' bond order , while that on the right has `` plaquette '' order .",
    "the theory @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) applies only at the qcp @xmath15 at its critical point obtained at @xmath16.,width=307 ]    the nature of some of the various possible ground states of such a hamiltonian are quite well understood .",
    "first , there are states that develop magnetic long range order and break the spin rotation symmetry .",
    "the simplest example ( and the one that we will focus on ) are collinear antiferromagnets where the order parameter is a single vector @xmath10 ( the nel vector ) , defined to describe a state of staggered magnetization , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is @xmath19 on one checkerboard sublattice and @xmath20 on the other .",
    "the nel state has @xmath21 and independent of @xmath22 ( see fig  [ pdiag ] ) , but more generally @xmath10 is presumed to vary `` slowly '' on the lattice scale over at least most of space .",
    "the low energy excitations of the nel state are simply linear dispersing spin waves .",
    "it is now recognized that a variety of quantum paramagnetic ground states are also possible where quantum fluctuations have prevented the spins from developing magnetic long range order , and so @xmath23 .",
    "such paramagnetic states can be broadly divided into two groups .",
    "first , there are states that can be described as ` valence bond solid ' ( vbs ) states @xcite . in a simple caricature of such a state , each spin forms a singlet with one particular other spin resulting in an ordered pattern of ` valence bonds ' . for spin-@xmath24 systems on a square lattice",
    ", such states necessarily break lattice translational symmetry .",
    "the so - called `` columnar '' and `` plaquette '' ordering patterns ( see fig .  [ pdiag ] ) are described by a complex vbs order parameter @xmath12 , where @xmath25    ( -1)^x , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\vec{s}_{r}\\cdot\\vec{s}_{r+\\hat{y } } & \\sim & { \\rm im}[\\psi_{\\rm vbs } ]    ( -1)^y ,    \\label{eq : vbsorder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath4 ( here columnar states have @xmath26 real and positive , while plaquette states have @xmath26 real and negative ) . in these states",
    "there is an energy gap for spin - carrying @xmath27 quasi - particle excitations ; these ` triplons ' @xcite are quite distinct from spin waves , and are instead adiabatically connected to spin excitons in band insulators .",
    "a second class of more exotic paramagnetic states are also possible@xcite in principle : in these states the valence bond configurations resonate amongst each other and form a ` liquid ' .",
    "the resulting state has been argued to possess excitations with fractional spin @xmath24 and interesting topological structure .",
    "our focus will be on the nature of the evolution of the ground state between these various phases .",
    "our primary example is that between the ordered magnet and a valence bond solid .",
    "we also discuss the phase transitions between valence bond solid and ` spin ' liquid phases ( see section  [ sec : vbssl ] ) .",
    "qualitatively similar phenomena will be ahown to obtain at both these transitions .",
    "both the magnetic nel state , and the valence bond solid are states of broken symmetry .",
    "the former breaks spin rotation symmetry , and the latter the symmetry of lattice translations .",
    "the order parameters @xmath28 and @xmath12 associated with these two different broken symmetries are very different . a lgw picture of the evolution between these two distinct ground states",
    "would be formulated in terms of an effective action that is a functional of @xmath28 and @xmath12 .",
    "such a construction would suggest either a first order transition , or passage through an intermediate phase which breaks both kinds of symmetry .",
    "( actually , the general lgw analysis also allows an intermediate ` disordered ' state with _ neither _ order , but this possibility was excluded in early analyses @xcite ; this exclusion was already an indication that lgw theory did not apply here . )",
    "a direct second order transition would be expected only by further fine - tuning to special multicritical points .",
    "our central thesis is that this expectation is wrong .",
    "a generic second order transition is possible between these two phases with different broken symmetries .",
    "the resulting critical theory is however unusual and _ not _ naturally described in terms of the order parameter fields of either phase .",
    "instead , the natural description is in terms of spin-@xmath24 `` spinon '' or cp@xmath29 fields @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is a spinor index ) .",
    "the nel order parameter is bilinear in the spinons : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the usual vector of pauli matrices and multiplication of the spinor index is implied .",
    "the fields @xmath34 create single spin-@xmath24 quanta , `` half '' that of the spin-@xmath35 quanta created by the nel field @xmath28 .",
    "the spinon fields @xmath34 so defined have a u(1 ) `` gauge '' redundancy .",
    "specifically the _ local _ phase rotation @xmath36 leaves the nel vector invariant and hence is a gauge degree of freedom . here",
    "@xmath37 is the imaginary time coordinate .",
    "thus the spinons are coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field @xmath38 ( we will use the greek indices @xmath39 to represent the three spacetime indices @xmath40 ) . our central thesis",
    " substantiated by a variety of arguments to follow  is that the critical field theory for the nel - vbs transition is just the simple continuum action @xmath41 , and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of @xmath44 components ( later we will consider the case of general @xmath45 ) , latexmath:[$|z|^2 \\equiv \\sum_{a=1}^n |z_a    value @xmath16 so that @xmath14 is at its scale - invariant critical point .",
    "the same action with a simple modification also describes the critical field theory for systems with easy - plane anisotropy , with the addition of the simple term @xmath47    with @xmath48 .",
    "we will discuss in more detail later why these would describe stable critical points - perhaps the most direct evidence comes from the numerical simulations reported in ref .",
    "of a lattice model of a cp@xmath29 field coupled to a noncompact gauge field ( a lattice version of eqn .",
    "[ sz ] ) , where a continuous transition was found in both the isotropic and easy plane cases .",
    "how can this action describe the onset of vbs order when it does not contain @xmath12 , and the @xmath34 are closely related to the nel order parameter ?",
    "in writing eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) , we have tacitly assumed @xmath49 to be a single - valued continuous field .",
    "in a more careful lattice implementation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cp1 ] ) , however , the resulting gauge field that appears is _ compact _ , _ i.e. _ defined only modulo @xmath50 .",
    "this allows for the presence of topological defects occurring at a single instant of space - time ( `` instantons '' ) called monopoles , at which magnetic flux @xmath51 is created or destroyed in integer multiples of @xmath50 . in general , eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) should thus be supplemented by terms which create or destroy such @xmath50 fluxes , or equivalently insert monopoles into the partition function : @xmath52^n + [ v_{r\\tau}^\\dagger]^n \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 insert monopoles of strength @xmath50 and @xmath55 at the space - time point @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "remarkably , it has been shown by read and sachdev @xcite that this operator may be identified with the vbs order parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 a simple argument to this effect will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] .",
    "thus vbs physics is implicitly ( albeit highly non - linearly ) contained in the gauge theory of eqs .",
    "( [ sz ] ) and ( [ eq : smono ] ) .",
    "our claim that eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) _ without the monopole creation terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smono ] )  _ describes the critical properties of the nel - vbs transition requires that the monopole `` fugacities '' @xmath58 are _ irrelevant _ in the renormalization group sense at the qcp .",
    "later sections of this paper will give a variety of compelling arguments , relying upon destructive quantum interference between different monopole events , for this irrelevance for spin-@xmath24 antiferromagnets .",
    "the arguments are based on quantum berry phase effects described first by haldane@xcite , which render @xmath59 oscillatory and negligible for @xmath60 for spin @xmath0 ( a different derivation appears in appendix  [ app : sjb ] and in the review in ref .  ) .",
    "although monopoles can be neglected at the qcp , this is not true at low energies in the vbs phase .",
    "indeed , it is well - known from studies of pure compact u(1 ) gauge theories , that the fugacities @xmath58 are always relevant in the absence of gapless `` matter fields '' ( _ i.e. _ the @xmath34 ) , so that monopoles inevitably proliferate in this case .",
    "this proliferation leads to a `` condensation '' of the monopole operator , @xmath61 , hence vbs order @xcite . at the same time it generates a gap for the gauge `` photon '' . in renormalization group terminology , the monopole condensation in the vbs phase  despite the fact that the @xmath58 are negligible at the qcp  indicates that ( some ) @xmath58 are `` dangerously irrelevant '' .",
    "it is important to note that such monopoles have a natural topological interpretation in terms of the conformations of the nel ordered state . in particular , low but non - zero energy configurations of the antiferromagnet",
    "are described by states with slowly - varying nel vector ( at least at spatial infinity ) of constant amplitude , @xmath62 such classical configurations with finite energy admit topological defects known as skyrmions ( see fig  [ skyr ] ) .    .",
    "in ( a ) we show the vector @xmath63 at different points in the xy plane ; note that @xmath64 , and so the underlying spins have a rapid sublattice oscillation which is not shown . in ( b )",
    "we show the vector @xmath65 along a section of ( a ) on the @xmath66 axis . along any other section of ( a ) ,",
    "a picture similar to ( b ) pertains , as the former is invariant under rotations about the @xmath44 axis .",
    "the skyrmion above has @xmath67 and @xmath68.,width=288 ]    the total _",
    "skyrmion number _ associated with a configuration defines an integer topological quantum number @xmath69 : @xmath70 remarkably ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : models ]  and ref .  ) , the skyrmion density is simply related to the magnetic flux of the gauge field @xmath49 , @xmath71 thus the monopole instantons that change the gauge flux by @xmath72 describe events in which the skyrmion number changes by @xmath73 .",
    "thus the flux creation operator @xmath53 can also be interpreted as a skyrmion creation operator .",
    "the skyrmion number changing events may be represented graphically as `` hedgehog '' configurations of the nel vector in space - time ( see fig .  [ hedge ] ) .    .",
    "so ( a ) contains the vector @xmath74 ; the spin configuration is radially symmetric , and consequently a similar picture is obtained along any other plane passing through the origin .",
    "similarly , ( b ) is the representation of @xmath65 along the @xmath66 axis , and a similar picture is obtained along any line in spacetime passing through the origin .",
    "the monopole above has @xmath75.,width=288 ]    the irrelevance of the monopole fugacities at the nel - vbs critical point is thus equivalent to the irrelevance of hedgehog fugacities in a semiclassical description .",
    "further , the recognition that such monopole events can be characterized as changing ( as a function of time ) the skyrmion number @xmath69 enables another interpretation of their irrelevance .",
    "in particular , in the critical fixed point theory in eq .",
    "( [ sz ] )  _ i.e. _ at low energies near the qcp  the skyrmion number @xmath69 is strictly conserved .",
    "the emergence of this conserved topological quantum number is the most fundamental meaning of the irrelevance of the instantons .",
    "we will also use this emergent topological conservation law as a definition of a `` deconfined '' qcp . indeed ,",
    "typically the gauge theories that arise in various slave particle descriptions of quantum magnets are _",
    "compact_. specializing to a u(1 ) gauge theory , the compactness means that instanton or monopole events in which the magnetic flux changes by @xmath50 are allowed configurations of the gauge field in space - time .",
    "the proliferation of these instanton events leads to confinement of the slave particles in the gauge theory . in contrast , in a non - compact theory  which emerges at low energies when monopoles are irrelevant  the total magnetic flux is strictly conserved .",
    "this is a topological conservation law and may be understood as a global u(1 ) symmetry in an appropriate dual description .",
    "indeed , we will explicitly construct such a dual theory for the case of easy - plane anisotropy ( and in some other related models ) .",
    "quite generally , then , the emergence of a non - compact u(1 ) gauge theory at the critical point between the nel and vbs phases signifies an extra emergent ( dual ) global u(1 ) symmetry for the critical theory that is not present in the microscopic hamiltonian .",
    "this provides a rather precise characterization of a ` deconfined ' critical point .",
    "an important property of the deconfined fixed points discussed in this paper is the appearance of two _ distinct _ diverging length ( or equivalently two time ) scales close to the transition - one of which rises as a power of the other .",
    "this is directly due to the dangerous irrelevance of monopoles . for the nel - vbs transition on approaching from the vbs side",
    "there is of course a diverging spin correlation length @xmath76 .",
    "however just beyond this length scale the system has not yet chosen to pin itself into any particular vbs ordered state .",
    "rather it may be characterized as fluctuating between different vbs configurations .",
    "it settles down to a particular ordered state at a larger length scale @xmath77 .",
    "this new length scale may also be characterized as the thickness of a domain wall in the vbs order .",
    "the universal crossovers associated with the critical fixed point describe the behavior on passing through the length scale @xmath76 .",
    "these are described by the critical theory in eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) .",
    "as explained above , this critical theory is monopole - free .",
    "the second crossover associated with the length scale @xmath78 describes how the system evolves from the paramagnetic phase associated with the monopole - free theory eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) to the true vbs phase that obtains when monopoles eventually proliferate .",
    "further details of the physics at the scales @xmath76 and @xmath78 appear in section  [ sec : phys - prop - near ] , where we also show in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xispvsxi ] ) that @xmath78 diverges as a power of @xmath76 which is greater than unity .    over the last several years we have become familiar with the notion of fractionalization of quantum numbers in stable phases in condensed matter .",
    "in contrast , the fractionalization phenomena obtained in this paper are specific to the critical point separating two conventional phases . these ` fractional ' particles  the spinons  are not present ( i.e confined or condensed ) at low energies on either side of the transition but appear naturally at the transition point . likewise the emergent gauge field that mediates interactions between the fractional particles is also specific to the critical point . on approaching the critical point , the confinement length scale diverges .",
    "thus ` deconfinement ' appears right at the transition .",
    "we will also briefly discuss the phase transitions between different quantum paramagnetic ground states .",
    "in particular we will argue that the existing theory for the transition between a vbs state and a fractionalized spin liquid implies that the corresponding critical point is also described by a deconfined u(1 ) gauge theory in precisely the same manner as above .",
    "furthermore , refs .",
    "argue that ( at least under certain conditions ) there are direct transitions between two different vbs phases that are also described by deconfined critical points with a u(1 ) gauge structure .",
    "there are several general lessons to be learnt from the results in this paper .",
    "first , we see that two dimensional spin-@xmath24 quantum magnetism is full of examples of ` deconfined ' quantum critical points which contradict the lgw paradigm for critical phenomena .",
    "this suggests that in more complex quantum systems ( _ e.g. _ with fermions or disorder ) novel critical phenomena may well be quite commonplace .",
    "such deconfinement may be at the root of interesting non - fermi liquid critical phenomena observed in the heavy fermion materials and possibly in the cuprates as well .",
    "second , our results resolve some long - standing controversies in the field of two dimensional quantum magnetism and have direct implications for experiments and numerical work in the field .",
    "third , our results shed some light on questions of confinement in gauge theories in two spatial dimensions .",
    "it was shown by polyakov several years ago @xcite that in two spatial dimensions for pure gauge theories ( i.e without any matter fields ) instantons generically always proliferate and drive the theory into a confined phase .",
    "the behavior in the presence of dynamic matter fields ( particularly with fermionic matter ) is much less understood and is a subject of some controversy @xcite .",
    "the results in this paper show that with bosonic matter there are at least isolated critical points @xcite at which deconfinement is obtained ( and the instantons disappear at long scales ) .",
    "while typically reaching criticality in a bosonic system requires some fine - tuning , fermionic systems can have stable critical phases .",
    "this supports the speculation that stable deconfined phases exist in two dimensional compact u(1 ) gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter @xcite .",
    "if true this would have interesting implications for the theory of spin liquid phases of quantum spin systems .",
    "these points are discussed further in section  [ sec : sjn ] and appendix  [ app : monoscr ] .",
    "apart from these general notions , there are also a number of specific physical ramifications of the proposed critical theory for the nel - vbs transition .",
    "one immediate consequence is that the anomalous dimension of the magnon operator is much larger than is usual at @xmath79 dimensional fixed points .",
    "thus the magnon spectral function will be extremely broad right at the critical point .",
    "many other implications are explored in some detail later in this paper and summarized in the overview in section  [ sec : overview ] .",
    "in this section we provide an overview of the main ideas in this paper .",
    "we begin by recalling some important prior results in the theory of quantum magnetism on the two dimensional square lattice . in the nel phase or close to it ,",
    "the long distance low energy fluctuations ( of the orientation ) of the nel order parameter are captured by the quantum o(3 ) non - linear sigma model ( nl@xmath80 m ) with the euclidean action ( we have promoted the lattice co - ordinate @xmath4 to a continuum spatial co - ordinate , and @xmath37 is imaginary time ) : @xmath81    \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{s}_b & = & i s \\sum_r \\epsilon_r \\mathcal{a}_r      \\label{eq : nlsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath82 is a unit three component vector that represents the nel order parameter ( the factor @xmath83 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ defeps ] ) ) .",
    "the term @xmath84 contains crucial quantum - mechanical berry phase effects , and is sensitive to the precise quantized value , @xmath85 of the microscopic spin on each lattice site : @xmath86 is the area enclosed by the curve mapped out by the time evolution of @xmath87 on the unit sphere .",
    "these berry phases play an unimportant role in the low energy properties of the nel phase @xcite , but are crucial in correctly describing the quantum paramagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "we will expand these earlier results to show here that they also modify the quantum critical point between these phases , so that the critical exponents are distinct from the theory without @xmath88 studied earlier @xcite .    to understand the summation over @xmath22 in @xmath84 , recall that , as described in section  [ sec : intro ] , in two spatial dimensions , smooth configurations of the nel vector admit skyrmion topological defects characterized by the integer topological charge @xmath69 .",
    "the berry phase @xmath84 vanishes@xcite for all _ smooth _ configurations even if they contain skyrmions . for such smooth configurations ,",
    "the total skyrmion number @xmath69 is conserved .",
    "crucially , however , the skyrmion number changing monopole events are _ not _ everywhere smooth .",
    "it was shown by haldane@xcite that the summation over @xmath22 in @xmath84 is non - vanishing in the presence of such monopole events .",
    "precise calculation@xcite gives a berry phase associated with each such skyrmion changing process which , for @xmath89 , oscillates rapidly on four sublattices of the dual lattice ( see appendix  [ app : sjb ] ) .",
    "this leads to destructive interference which effectively suppresses all monopole events unless they are quadrupled@xcite ( _ i.e _ they change skyrmion number by four ) .",
    "the nl@xmath80 m field theory augmented by these berry phase terms is , in principle , powerful enough to correctly describe the quantum paramagnet .",
    "summing over the various monopole tunnelling events shows that in the paramagnetic phase the presence of the berry phases leads to vbs order@xcite .",
    "this crucial result from prior work identifies the vbs phase as resulting from a proliferation of monopoles in the presence of non - trivial berry phases .",
    "the non - trivial identification of the vbs order parameter expressed from bond energies in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbsorder ] ) as the skyrmion creation operator is remarkable .",
    "when this operator acquires an expectation value vbs order results . in this manner @xmath90 contains within it the ingredients describing both the ordered phases of @xmath91 .",
    "an important conclusion which follows from this body of work , via the above identification , is that a direct second order transition from the ( collinear ) nel phase to a translation symmetric ` spin - liquid ' is likely to be absent in two spatial dimensions .",
    "this still leaves several possibilities for the evolution of the ground state from the nel to the vbs phases .",
    "for instance , there could be two transitions with an intermediate phase that breaks both nel and lattice symmetries ( an intermediate phase that breaks neither symmetry is excluded ) , or simply a first order transition .",
    "the possibility of a direct second order transition between nel and vbs phases is hinted at by several results in the existing literature .",
    "first , note that in the nel phase monopole tunneling events are absent at long length and time scales . in the quantum paramagnet",
    "these monopole tunneling events have proliferated .",
    "the haldane phases then lead to vbs order .",
    "the existence of a monopole condensate is clearly incompatible with long range nel order .",
    "thus to the extent that the broken lattice symmetry of the vbs state is a _ consequence _ of the proliferation of monopoles it competes with the nel state .",
    "a direct transition from nel to vbs then becomes conceivable @xcite .",
    "a second hint comes from examining large-@xmath45 studies of su@xmath92 quantum spin models @xcite . in the limit @xmath93 ( and in a bosonic representation of the spins ) there is a second order transition between the nel phase and a quantum paramagnet . in this limit",
    "the paramagnet breaks no symmetries ( including lattice symmetries ) .",
    "furthermore , it supports gapped spin-@xmath24 excitations ( known as spinons ) .",
    "however , both features are known to be artifacts of the limit @xmath93 . upon including finite @xmath45 corrections , broken lattice symmetry appears ( leading to a vbs phase ) .",
    "the spinons also feel a gauge force that leads to their confinement and disappear from the spectrum . what about the vicinity of the transition ? to answer this , it is instructive to examine the various length scales in the problem in the paramagnetic state .",
    "first , there is the spin correlation length that diverges on approaching the transition .",
    "note that deep in the paramagnetic phase this length stays constant when @xmath94 .",
    "then , there is the length scale at which vbs order appears .",
    "as there is no vbs order at @xmath93 this length scale must _ diverge _ as @xmath95  hence it must be much bigger than the spin correlation length in the large-@xmath45 limit .",
    "finally , there is a third ( somewhat loosely defined ) length scale that may be thought of as the length scale associated with spinon confinement .",
    "clearly this scale also diverges as @xmath95 and is much bigger than the spin correlation length .",
    "indeed calculations of the vbs and confinement length scales in the large-@xmath45 limit show that they are @xmath96 , where @xmath76 is the spin correlation length @xcite and @xmath97 is a constant .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a direct transition between nel and vbs states in the large-@xmath45 limit where the monopoles ( and hence their berry phases ) are irrelevant at the critical fixed point , but are important in producing vbs order and confinement in the paramagnetic state .",

    "in particular , it was assumed that the confinement length scale will stay finite at the transition , which was then modelled ( for physical @xmath98 spins ) by the lgw theory obtained simply by neglecting @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlsm ] ) : this is the o(3)-invariant wilson - fisher fixed point @xcite . in light of the discussion above , it is clear that as the confinement goes hand in hand with the vbs order both confinement and vbs length scales diverge at the transition .",

    "@xcite was pointed out by sachdev and park@xcite .",
    "the latter authors argued that there was a finite density of monopoles in space - time right at the critical point of the o(3 ) lgw model , and the berry phases then implied the presence of finite vbs order at any such critical point .",
    "based on this they suggested that a possible evolution between the nel and vbs phases was through a region of coexistence of both broken symmetries .",
    "however , they left open the possibility of a direct second order transition between the nel and vbs phases , but argued that any such transition could not be described by the o(3 ) lgw model .",
    "our discussion here makes it clear it is necessary that the corresponding fixed point have no monopoles at long scales .",
    "the natural candidate is then precisely the fixed point governing the transition in the model with monopoles forbidden .",

    "this transition was argued to possess the remarkable property of being _ self - dual_.    the possibility of deconfinement of spinons at the critical point between nel and vbs phases is also hinted at by a different consideration that is again motivated by the large-@xmath45 calculations .",
    "the excitations of both the nel and vbs phases are conventional ( _ i.e _ do not contain any fractionalized spinons ) . in a schwinger boson description in terms of spin-@xmath24 spinons",
    "this is achieved through confinement .",
    "however the detailed mechanism of such spinon confinement is different in the two phases . in the nel phase ( described as a spinon condensate ) confinement is achieved through the usual higgs mechanism . on the other hand , in the vbs phase confinement",
    "is achieved through proliferation of instantons .",
    "this difference in the confinement physics then makes it conceivable that neither mechanism is actually operational at the critical point and deconfinement obtains .",
    "there have been a large number of numerical studies of the destruction of nel order in the @xmath0 square lattice antiferromagnet @xcite . while there is evidence for the existence of vbs order in the paramagnetic phase , @xcite the nature of the transition between the nel and paramagnetic states",
    "has been difficult to address .",
    "a major obstacle is the well - known ` sign ' problem , which prevents large - scale monte carlo simulations . until recently ,",
    "all large scale studies of the destruction of nel order have been on models with an even number of @xmath0 spins per unit cell , with a paramagnetic phase which does not break any lattice symmetries .",
    "@xcite    the first large - scale study of the destruction of nel order in a @xmath0 square lattice antiferromagnet , in a hamiltonian which preserves a single @xmath0 spin per unit cell and the full symmetry of the square lattice , was that of sandvik _ et al .",
    "this was on a model with a strong easy - plane anisotropy .",
    "such easy plane models have been studied analytically previously @xcite and will be pursued further in the present paper .",
    "ref .   found convincing evidence for vbs order in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "furthermore , the vbs and nel order appear to vanish at points close to each other , suggesting a direct second order transition in the class discussed in the present paper .",
    "we also note the wavefunction monte carlo work of capriotti _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the su(2 ) @xmath0 antiferromagnet on the square lattice with first and second neighbor exchange .",
    "they found a ` resonating valence bond ' wavefunction characteristic of a spin liquid state .",
    "our results here suggest that they were perhaps observing the deconfined state characteristic of the critical point , and that they had not yet reached the crossover to vbs order at the longest scales .      in this paper ,",
    "the proposal of a deconfined continuous nel - vbs transition ( as well as a vbs - spin liquid transition ) is substantiated by a variety of arguments .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : models ] we consider a concrete lattice @xmath99 model which , for @xmath43 , embodies the physics of the nel state , the monopoles and their haldane berry s phases ( focusing on @xmath0 ) , and the vbs state .",
    "this model , introduced by sachdev and jalabert @xcite , and referred to here as the sj model , provides a convenient starting point for theoretical analysis of the @xmath98 invariant critical region .",
    "we address the nature of the physically interesting @xmath43 case by showing that , in the two limits @xmath100 ( section  [ sec : sj1 ] ) and @xmath101 ( section  [ sec : sjn ] ) ) , this model indeed sustains a deconfined critical point in the precise sense defined above . for @xmath100 ,",
    "this can be directly shown using lattice duality transformations , which demonstrate an exact equivalence of the sj model to a @xmath102 classical xy model with a fourfold symmetry breaking term which corresponds physically to strength four monopoles .",
    "such four - fold anisotropy is known to be irrelevant at the @xmath102 xy transition @xcite , establishing the deconfinement of this case . for @xmath101 , the scaling dimension of the 4-skyrmion creation operator",
    "was computed previously by murthy and sachdev@xcite , and is such that monopoles are again irrelevant .",
    "hence we expect by continuity that monopoles are irrelevant for _ all _ @xmath45 , including the interesting case @xmath43 .",
    "second , in section  [ sec : ep ] , we consider specifically @xmath43 , in the presence of additional ( strong ) easy - plane anisotropy . in this case , the sj model may be rewritten as a pair of o(2 ) rotors ( the phases of @xmath34 ) interacting with a compact u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "the latter may be analyzed directly using duality techniques ( appendix  [ app : sj2 ] ) .",
    "we obtain in this way an explicit dual representation in terms of complex `` vortex '' annihilation operators @xmath103 ( @xmath31 ) and a dual _ non - compact _ gauge field @xmath104 , whose flux represents the ( exactly ) conserved uniform spin density @xmath105 .",
    "one may understand the relation to the cp@xmath29 variables by recognizing that @xmath106 creates a @xmath107 vortex in @xmath108 , while @xmath109 creates a @xmath55 vortex in @xmath110 , both of which create physical @xmath50 vorticity in @xmath111 .",

    "briefly , the two types of vortices correspond to `` merons '' ( half - skyrmions ) , in which the nel vector points either up or down inside the vortex core . the skyrmion number changing monopole events thereby correspond precisely to an event in which a vortex core tunnels from the up to down staggered magnetization or vice - versa .",
    "the advantage of this representation is that the ( quadrupled ) monopole fugacity appears explicitly as a local operator in terms of the vortex fields . remarkably , if this fugacity , @xmath115 , is set to zero ( as appropriate at the qcp provided it is , as we argue , irrelevant ) , the dual action in eq .",
    "( [ crtny ] ) has precisely the same form as the original one , eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) .",
    "more precisely , an exact equivalence can be demonstrated between lattice regularizations of the original and dual theory in the absence of monopoles @xcite .",
    "thus , as found in ref .  , the proposed critical theory in the easy - plane case has an unusual self - duality property .    the irrelevance of monopoles",
    "can then be argued in several ways .",
    "first , using the self - duality , each power of the skyrmion creation operator has the same correlations at the qcp as the corresponding power of the xy staggered raising operator @xmath116 . at the deconfined critical point ,",
    "fluctuations of @xmath116 are expected to be stronger than they are at a conventional ( confined ) xy critical point .",
    "the corresponding quadrupled operator is already irrelevant in the latter case ( as mentioned above ) , so we expect the four - skyrmion fugacity to be only more irrelevant around the deconfined critical theory .",
    "this expectation is supported by an explicit calculation in a large-@xmath45 ( different from the @xmath45 in the sj model ) generalization of the dual critical theory in section  [ sec : phase - ep ] .",
    "further arguments are given in appendix  [ app : est ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : superfl - insul - trans ] we demonstrate for the easy plane case a direct derivation of the dual critical theory from a microscopic bosonic representation of the underlying xy model , without utilizing either the nl@xmath80 m or sj models .    in section  [ sec :",
    "vbssl ] , we show that analogous deconfinement obtains for a vbs to spin - liquid transition .",

    "the product is over all locations of monopoles , and @xmath125 is the change in skyrmion number associated with the monopole .",

    "the fixed integer field @xmath127 is @xmath128 depending on whether the dual lattice coordinate is ( even , even ) , ( even , odd ) , ( odd , even ) or ( odd , odd ) , so that the phase factor associated with each monopole is @xmath129 on these sublattices ( see fig  [ offset ] in section  [ sec : sj1 ] ) .",
    "the oscillating nature of the berry phase factors on adjacent plaquette leads to destructive interference between different tunnelling paths for single monopoles .",
    "indeed this interference effectively kills all monopole events unless they are quadrupled ( _ i.e _ change skyrmion number by four ) .",
    "hence only such quadrupled monopole events need be including in the quantum statistical mechanical partition sum .",
    "we have already indicated the remarkable identification of the vbs order parameter defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vbsorder ] ) with the skyrmion annihilation operator , @xmath130 , as shown in ref .  .",

    "because of the importance of this result , we give a simplified derivation of this relation here .",
    "it is important to recognize that the vbs order parameter in eq .",

    "any other field with the same symmetry properties as @xmath12 will , on general scaling and renormalization group grounds , be proportional to @xmath12 in the critical region . thus to prove the identification of @xmath12 with the skyrmion creation operator @xmath131 , it is sufficient to show that the latter transforms identically to @xmath12 under all symmetry operations .    as a topological index ,",
    "the skyrmion number is unchanged under smooth global @xmath98 spin rotations , hence the skyrmion number changing operator is also an @xmath98 scalar .",
    "likewise , @xmath132 , being defined through scalar bond operators , is @xmath98 invariant . let us consider the effect of lattice symmetry transformations on @xmath131 . in the functional integral this operator is defined by insertion of a space - time monopole .",
    "it is easy to see that under @xmath133 rotations in the counter - clockwise direction about a direct lattice site ( which we denote @xmath134 ) , the berry phase associated with the skyrmion creation event changes by @xmath135 .",

    "the physical @xmath116 field is a composite of two spinon fields and likewise the skyrmion field is a composite of the two meron fields .",
    "let us now imagine including instanton events .",
    "this is most easily accessed in the vortex representation where it simply amounts to letting @xmath182 .",
    "this is the main advantage of the dual representation  the non - trivial non - local effect of instantons is represented as a simple local perturbation in the dual theory .",
    "we may now address the question of relevance / irrelevance of instantons at the @xmath180 fixed point .",
    "this is determined by the scaling dimension @xmath183 of the @xmath184 operator , in principle determined from the two - point correlation function of this operator in the ( non - trivial ) theory with @xmath185 : @xmath186 where @xmath187 are space - time coordinates .",
    "hence @xmath183 is determined by the correlations of the fourth power of the physical vbs order parameter , and one requires @xmath188 for irrelevance .",
    "being self - dual , the same anomalous dimension should be ascribed to the correlations of the physical boson ( xy order parameter ) .",
    "the @xmath180 critical fixed point describes an xy ordering transition where the physical boson field is a composite of the fundamental fields of the theory .",
    "we therefore expect that correlators of the physical boson ( and its various powers ) will decay with an anomalous dimension that is _ larger _ than the corresponding one for the ordinary xy transition in @xmath189 dimensions .",
    "now for the usual xy fixed point four - fold symmetry breaking perturbations are known to be _ irrelevant _ , _ i.e. _ have a scaling dimension @xmath190 .",
    "this then implies that a small @xmath115 will be irrelevant by power counting at the @xmath180 fixed point of the present model as well ( see also appendix [ app : est ] ) .",

    "a direct second order transition between the @xmath44 condensed and vbs phases is possible with a ` deconfined ' critical point .",
    "right at this point , monopole tunneling events become irrelevant and spinon degrees of freedom emerge as the natural fields of the critical theory .",
    "this provides strong evidence that the same thing happens for the @xmath98 symmetric model ( _ i.e _ at @xmath214 ) .    what then is the proposed description of the critical point in the @xmath98 symmetric model",

    "further evidence for the continuous nature of the transition in the cp@xmath29 model coupled to a noncompact gauge field is obtained by considering the larger class of models with cp@xmath217 fields coupled to a noncompact gauge theory .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath100 model has a continuous transition @xcite which is dual to the xy transition , and a continuous transition is also expected for large values of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the model of interest @xmath43 is sandwiched between these two extremes where a continuous transition is well known to obtain .",
    "we now discuss the consequences of the theory for the physical properties near the direct nel - vbs transition .",
    "we will first discuss those properties that follow generally from the ( dangerous ) irrelevance of monopoles .",
    "later we will specialize to the easy plane limit where the self - duality enables more progress .",
    "it is useful to think first about the various length scales in the problem in the vbs phase .",
    "first there is the spin - spin correlation length @xmath76 which will diverge at the transition .",
    "second , there is a length scale @xmath78 associated with the ` thickness ' of the domain walls of the ( discrete ) vbs order .",
    "the latter is clearly determined by the strength of the quadrupled monopole operator , @xmath218 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : smono ] ) ; in the easy plane case , @xmath115 appears as the co - efficient of a local term in the dual action eq .",
    "( [ crtny ] ) .",
    "these two length scales will diverge differently - the domain wall thickness will diverge faster than the spin - spin correlation length",
    ". one can determine the scaling of @xmath78 with @xmath76 by a matching argument .",
    "on scaling grounds , one expects @xmath219 where @xmath220 is a scaling function , and @xmath221 is the rg eigenvalue of @xmath115 assuming the scaling dimension of the four monopole operator is @xmath222 , and @xmath223 . beyond the scale of the correlation length @xmath76 , one can regard the vbs phase as xy ordered in @xmath12 , though with very weak four - fold anisotropy since @xmath115 is irrelevant at the qcp .",
    "hence the low - energy variations of the phase @xmath224 of @xmath225 are described as a pseudo - goldstone mode , with energy @xmath226,\\ ] ] where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are renormalized parameters on the scale of @xmath76 .",
    "a twist of @xmath224 ( of e.g. @xmath133 ) is carried hence by a domain wall which , by dimensional analysis , has width @xmath229 .",
    "knowing then that @xmath230 , one requires that @xmath231 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xiscaling ] ) , which implies @xcite @xmath232 since @xmath233 , @xmath78 indeed grows more rapidly than @xmath76 as the qcp is approached .",
    "thus there are two independent diverging length scales .",
    "either of these length scales may be given several different interpretations .",
    "for instance , the spin correlation length @xmath76 may also be interpreted as the length scale at which correlations of the dual global order parameter crossover from that of the critical fixed point to that of the ( unstable ) fixed point which breaks the dual global continuous symmetry .",
    "similarly , the domain wall thickness @xmath78 of the vbs order is also the length scale at which the photon that couples to the spinons acquires a mass due to instanton effects .",
    "this is also the length beyond which the logarithmic coulomb potential between spinons crosses over to a linear confining one .",
    "this is distinct from the ` confinement ' length scale describing the spatial size of the resulting two - spinon bound states ( triplons ) .",
    "this length scale is actually a non - trivial combination of the two other diverging length scales .",
    "it however diverges faster than the spin correlation length @xmath76 .",
    "note that the critical theory is isotropic in space - time and therefore has dynamic scaling exponent @xmath234 .",
    "the values of other critical exponents may be obtained from the numerical work of ref .  .",
    "in the @xmath235 symmetric case the correlation length exponent @xmath236 ( for @xmath76 ) , and the nel order parameter exponent @xmath237 .",
    "perhaps most remarkably the anamolous dimension of the nel order parameter field @xmath238 is large ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "this should be contrasted with the extremely small value for @xmath238 at the usual wilson - fisher @xmath235 fixed point in @xmath215 dimensions ( and indeed for most other familiar three dimensional critical points ) .",
    "the large value of @xmath238 can be rationalized by the thinking that the nel order parameter field decays into spinons right at the critical point .",
    "indeed as argued in previous sections it is the spinons which appear as the more natural degrees of freedom at the deconfined critical point .",
    "we note however that the spinons are not to be considered ` free particles ' - they are critical and furthermore interact through the coupling to the non - compact gauge field .",
    "consider the effect of twisting the boundary conditions on the vbs order  for instance , for columnar dimerization prefer even columns at one boundary and odd columns at the opposite boundary .",
    "let us suppose the twist is applied between the top and bottom ends ( @xmath240 ) of an @xmath241 sample",
    ". on general grounds , the energy cost at long scales will be @xmath242 , where @xmath80 is a `` surface tension '' or domain wall energy per unit length .",
    "this surface tension is set , however , by the irrelevant monopole term and vanishes in a manner set by the divergence of the domain wall thickness . in particular , the surface tension scaling obtains only for twists sustained over a distance @xmath243 . for twists of the vbs order over a shorter distance @xmath244 such that @xmath245 , the energy cost for this twist is greatly reduced to @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is the `` stiffness '' associated with the continuous dual global symmetry ( and we are at length scales where the system has not realized this symmetry is actually discrete ) .",
    "the two energy costs for the twist become comparable for @xmath248 , so that one expects @xmath249 .",
    "this stiffness itself vanishes upon approaching the quantum critical point in a manner set by the divergence of the spin correlation length .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding exponent is the same as for the spin stiffness on the other side of the transition .",
    "specifically , the vbs stiffness @xmath250 where @xmath76 is the dual correlation length , @xmath251 is the spatial dimension , and @xmath234 is the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "thus @xmath252 .",
    "note that this is _ not _ a test of self - duality but rather a test of the irrelevance of monopoles : the scaling of the vbs stiffness is a consequence of dual current conservation which obtains if monopoles are irrelevant .",
    "thus the same behavior is also expected for the isotropic model .    in practice ,",
    "a measurement of the domain wall energy in the columnar state is likely best obtained by simply comparing energies of systems of size @xmath241 ( in the @xmath66 and @xmath163 directions , respectively ) with periodic boundary conditions in both directions ( _ i.e. _ on the torus ) and varying @xmath244 . in particular , let us consider @xmath253 , with @xmath254 odd . in this case , the columns will prefer to align along the short direction ( _ i.e. _ columns parallel to the @xmath66 axis , breaking translational symmetry along @xmath163 ) in order to avoid introducing a domain wall ( which would be required in the other orientation due to the odd @xmath254 ) with energy cost @xmath255 .",
    "if @xmath244 is odd , there will still be a domain wall required , but it is shorter and less costly , with energy @xmath256 .",
    "hence one expects the ground state energy of the system to be @xmath257 for @xmath244 even , and @xmath258 for @xmath244 odd . here",
    "@xmath259 is the ground state energy density .",
    "hence the surface tension can be obtained by @xmath260 this behavior will obtain provided @xmath261 . when the system is smaller than the domain wall thickness , however , this energy is determined instead by the stiffness , _",
    "@xmath262 for @xmath263 .",
    "it is also clear that at the critical point , both columnar dimer and plaquette order parameters will have power law correlators with the same exponent .",
    "this is independent of which one of these two phases we eventually end up in .",
    "this is because both order parameters are contained in the dual global boson creation operator .",
    "they correspond to the phase of this boson locking in different directions .",
    "which one of these phases is selected is determined by the sign of the anisotropy term , but as this is renormalizing to zero at the critical fixed point , there will be no distinction between the two order parameter correlations at the critical point .",
    "this suggests the following interesting numerical check .",
    "consider , for instance , the situation where the disordered phase has columnar vbs order . now",
    "consider measuring the stiffness to _ plaquette _ order in this columnar phase .",
    "since this order is not spontaneous in the vbs phase , measuring this stiffness can not be accomplished as above by simply comparing systems with odd and even lengths .",
    "instead , one should imagine introducing e.g. two rows separated by half @xmath244 on which the magnetic couplings have been increased or decreased in a pattern mimicking the strong bonds of the plaquette state .",
    "the ground state energy of this system should be compared with that obtained by shifting one of these rows by one lattice spacing , and the difference of these two energies interpreted as the energy cost for a twist of the plaquette order parameter .",
    "deep in the phase , this energy cost will be exponentially small , @xmath264 . however , in the regime @xmath265 the cost for the twist of the plaquette order parameter will be determined by the stiffness , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath266 .",
    "there will thus be a dramatic change from exponential to power - law behavior in this quantity on approaching the critical point .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality @xmath267 will equal the corresponding stiffness @xmath247 for columnar order and scale identically to the physical spin stiffness on the other side of the transition . once again , this is not a test of self - duality but follows from the irrelevance of monopoles and will hold in the isotropic case as well .",
    "specializing to the easy plane case , the self - duality of the critical fixed point implies some further interesting properties .",
    "first , it is clear that the dual global boson will have the same power law decay as the physical spin - correlator .",
    "the former is identified with the vbs order parameter while the latter corresponds to the staggered xy correlators in the microscopic spin model .",
    "we thus have the remarkable result that the columnar dimer , plaquette , and staggered xy magnetization all decay with the same power law right at the critical point .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath268 exponent for the particular vbs order that actually develops will be the same as the @xmath268 for the spin order .",
    "this is because the anisotropy only serves to lock the phase of the dual order parameter .",
    "the amplitude is already non - zero in the scaling limit near the critical point .",
    "as elaborated in the previous subsection , there are two diverging length ( or equivalently time ) scales upon approaching the transition from the vbs side",
    ". how does this manifest itself in the nel ordered side ? to understand this first note that in the ordered phase close to the transition there will be ` soft ' modes that correspond to the incipient vbs order on the other side of the transition .",
    "indeed the frequency of these modes will go to zero at the critical point . for concreteness consider the case where the vbs order that develops is columnar .",
    "then as is natural there will be a soft mode corresponding to columnar order with frequency vanishing on approaching the critical point",
    ". remarkably there will be other soft modes that correspond to plaquette ordering whose frequency also vanish on approaching the transition .",
    "once again this is despite there being no such order in the vbs phase .",
    "this result is already implied by the discussion in the preceding subsection .",
    "indeed both the plaquette and columnar order parameters have power law correlations at the critical point regardless of which one of the two orders actually develops in the vbs phase .",
    "thus it is natural that the frequencies of both modes go to zero on approaching the critical point from the ordered side .",
    "furthermore , both soft mode frequencies vanish in exactly the same universal way on approaching the transition .",
    "formally the columnar and plaquette order parameters are distinguished only by the orientation of the phase of the complex vbs order parameter . in the absence of monopole tunneling events ( which tend to pin this phase to certain values )",
    ", these two distinct order parameter fields will both behave in a common manner determined by the complex vbs order parameter .",
    "thus in the scaling limit near the critical point both the plaquette and columnar order parameters will display the same universal behavior . on general scaling grounds we expect the vbs soft mode frequency @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the ground state spin stiffness of the nel ordered state .    despite the common universal behavior of the vanishing frequency of the two distinct vbs soft modes",
    ", there will be a small splitting between the two frequencies that is due to the irrelevant ( quadrupled ) monopole tunneling events . indeed the information about which of the two vbs orders eventually develops in the paramagnetic phase is contained in this small splitting .",
    "if columnar order develops , then the corresponding soft mode will have slightly lower frequency in the ordered phase as compared to the plaquette soft mode .",
    "note that this splitting will go to zero as the critical point is approached as the monopole fugacity renormalizes to zero .",
    "this will however vanish in a very different way from the overall vbs energy scale @xmath271 .",
    "indeed this splitting defines a new energy scale that vanishes faster than @xmath271 .",
    "thus we see that two different energy scales also characterize the physics of the ordered phase .    in the easy plane case , one intriguing aspect of our theory is the physics of the vortex cores in the xy ordered phase close to the transition . as discussed extensively ,",
    "there are two kinds of classical meron vortices which tunnel into each other in the quantum theory . however , the irrelevance of these instanton tunneling events near the transition implies that the ising order in the core will survive for a very long time .",
    "we have , up to this point , not considered any effects which explicitly break the lattice translational symmetry .",
    "hence the discussion should be read as appropriate for extended , plane wave states of vortices .",
    "crucially , these states may be classified by their ( quasi-)wavevectors .",
    "consider the continuum theory in which the spatially - oscillating single instanton events are neglected , and only the ( irrelevant ) quadrupled instanton fugacity @xmath115 is included . in the dual formulation ,",
    "the two ising vortex states appear as relativistic charged particles .",
    "they carry a conserved u(1 ) non - compact gauge charge ( physically their vorticity ) , _ i.e. _ the number of these vorticies @xmath272 is conserved .",
    "there is a discrete @xmath177 global symmetry , which implies that @xmath273 is conserved modulo 8 .",
    "the latter is a consequence of the continuum limit which removes the single instanton events , and is promoted to a continuous u(1 ) symmetry ( with @xmath273 fully conserved ) if the quadrupled instantons are also neglected .",
    "physically , then , excitations of the vortex vacuum , _ i.e. _ the xy ordered state , can be labelled by these quantum numbers .",
    "and one should expect there to be `` quasiparticles '' ( really `` quasivortices '' or `` quasimerons '' ) carrying an elementary unit ( @xmath274 ) non - compact gauge charge ( physically @xmath275 vorticity ) and an elementary @xmath177 charge @xmath276 .",
    "these vortices ( as befits an xy ordered phase ) , with a ` core energy ' scaling as @xmath277 .",
    "there will be other gapped excitations ( also with a gap of @xmath278 ) with zero non - compact gauge charge ( zero vorticity ) and @xmath279 , which can be viewed as the vbs soft modes , or alternatively as `` vortex excitons '' .",
    "let us now consider the effects of the neglected oscillating single monopole term .",
    "navely , this violates the @xmath177 conservation law , and can mix the quasimeron states with @xmath280 .",
    "however , due to the 4-sublattice oscillation , the process in which one meron state is converted to another is accompanied by the addition of a large momentum . in the absence of a sink for this momentum ,",
    "therefore , _ even the single instanton term can not mix the two meron quasiparticle states_. at non - zero temperature , thermally excitated excitations with a large gap ( @xmath281 ) can provide this momentum , but are present only with an exponentially small probability due to their gap .",
    "hence violations of the conservation of the `` ising '' charge of a single quasiparticle are exponentially weak at low temperature .",
    "of course , _ four _ quasiparticles with `` up '' ising cores can scatter off one another to produce four quasiparticles with `` down '' ising cores via the non - oscillating @xmath115 term .",
    "the amplitude for even this process is , however , suppressed by the irrelevance of @xmath115 if one is near the qcp .",
    "thus we arrive at the remarkable conclusion that the `` elementary '' gapped vortex excitations of the xy ordered phase carry a sharp extra ising quantum number .",
    "ramifications will be explored in sec .",
    "[ sec : vl ] .    a number of other predictions may also be made on the effects of various perturbations that can be added to the hamiltonian near the zero temperature critical point .",
    "first let us think about the excitation structure in the paramagnetic side .",
    "deep in the phase , the lowest spinful excitations will be @xmath282 which will be gapful .",
    "on approaching the transition , due to the diverging ` confinement ' length one might navely think that this will break up into spinons .",
    "however even with a non - compact gauge field due to the log attraction coming from the photon there will be logarithmic confinement and the lowest energy spin carrying excitations will continue to have @xmath282 this `` magnon '' is a gauge neutral bound state of two spinons .",
    "now imagine sitting in the paramagnetic side close to the transition , and turn on a zeeman field along the @xmath283axis in spin space .",
    "once the zeeman energy exceeds the magnon gap , the chemical potential for such magnons becomes positive and they should condense to modify the ground state .",
    "this leads to xy antiferromagnetic order . in the non - compact approximation , because this condensate is gauge neutral , it does not create a gap for the photon via the higgs mechanism . in reality",
    "( _ i.e. _ beyond the non - compact approximation ) what this means is that there will be coexistence between vbs and xy order .",
    "as the spinons are not condensed in this phase , there is no disruption of the vbs order ( this can be seen _",
    "e.g. _ from the fact that the spinons appear as dual `` vortices '' in the vbs order parameter , while the magnons carry zero dual vorticity ) .",
    "these considerations hold only provided another transition does not pre - empt magnon condensation as the zeeman field is increased .",
    "this will happen , _",
    "e.g. _ if the magnons experience attractive interactions with one another .",
    "indeed , in a coulomb interacting system , it is natural to expect that the magnons , which are the analog of excitons , will have attractive interactions with one another at long distances , due to the analog of `` van der waals '' forces between their fluctuating dipole moments .",
    "this attraction , however , competes with other local interactions due to the complex critical physics on scales @xmath284 , so the outcome is not clear .",
    "therefore , we do not see a clear argument against a continuous magnon condensation transition into a coexistence phase . likewise , of course , we can not rule out a direct first order transition . in any case",
    "it therefore seems as though a direct second order transition between the magnetically ordered and vbs phases is unlikely at non - zero zeeman field .",
    "if the coexistence phase exists , it is interesting to contemplate the transition between the coexistence phase and the pure magnetically ordered one ( with canted antiferromagnetic order ) . in the system with xy symmetry",
    ", a transition with exactly these symmetries has been studied in ref .  .",
    "in this paper , it was shown that , despite coexisting superfluid order and the consequent gapless goldstone mode , this transition is in the universality class of a @xmath102 xy model , the @xmath177 symmetry breaking perturbation _ and _ the coupling to the goldstone mode being irrelevant .",
    "thinking in terms of the dual formulation suggests this analysis should apply here .",
    "in particular , both vortex fields @xmath173 remain gapped across the transition , since both phases are xy ordered .",
    "only the composite order parameter @xmath285 is involved in the criticality , and it does not couple minimally to the non - compact gauge field . integrating out the massive vortex fields while keeping a composite @xmath12 field and the gauge fluctuations describing the goldstone mode , one arrives at a model equivalent to ref .  .",
    "note that this result implies that this critical point is also deconfined in precisely the same sense as the others discussed in this paper .",
    "consider the effect of a staggered zeeman field on the original spin model .",
    "first assume easy plane anisotropy in the plane orthogonal to the applied field .",
    "the staggered field will always induce some staggered magnetization but we can ask about xy or vbs order superimposed on this . in the cp@xmath29 description , a staggered zeeman field corresponds to a uniform ` magnetic ' field that couples to the @xmath44 component of @xmath118 .",
    "it is quite clear that there will now be a split transition between the vbs and xy ordered phases with an intermediate phase with neither xy nor vbs order ( but of course with a staggered magnetization ) .",
    "consider the approach from the vbs phase . in the presence of the staggered field",
    ", one of the two cp@xmath29 fields will condense first .",
    "this transition is described by the @xmath213 sj model ( and is inverted @xmath102 xy ) .",
    "the resulting phase is the advertised phase with neither xy or sp order .",
    "actually it is more useful to think of this critical point in the gauge language as a ` deconfined ' critical point than just as inverted xy .",
    "this is so particularly if one asks about the magnon spectral function at this transition .",
    "this will be determined by the spinon dynamics which in turn are coupled to a non - compact u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "thus we might again expect anamolously broad spectral functions even though both phases are confined .",
    "( note that total @xmath105 is still conserved ) .",
    "eventually , as one tunes towards the xy ordered phase , the other cp@xmath29 field will also condense leading to xy order .",
    "this transition is actually exactly dual to the other one discussed above .",
    "this is because the staggered zeeman field couples to the same operator in both the cp@xmath29 and dual representations . for small staggered zeeman fields",
    ", the phase boundaries must come in with the same exponents , etc .",
    "finally , in the o(3 ) model , the second transition will not happen as the nel vector will immediately line up with the staggered field .",
    "however , the first transition will continue to be described by the @xmath100 sj model .",
    "details of the slopes of various phase boundaries etc . may be found ref .   - in the terminology of that reference , a uniform field corresponds to the staggered zeeman field discussed here .",
    "finite temperature properties near the transition may also be discussed .",
    "here it is clearly necessary to distinguish between the easy plane and isotropic cases . in the latter , the nel order does not survive for any non - zero @xmath286 while in the former case there is power law order at low @xmath286 which eventually disappears through a berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition . in both cases",
    "however the discrete broken lattice symmetry of the vbs phase will survive upto a non - zero finite @xmath286 .",
    "the associated finite-@xmath286 transition will be in the universality class of the @xmath177 clock model in @xmath251 .",
    "this transition is known to be described by a _ line _ of fixed points with continuously variable ( _ i.e. _ nonuniversal ) critical exponents .",
    "the line of fixed points results from the exact marginality of the fourfold symmetry breaking term @xmath26 , _",

    ", we note that one may define @xmath327 for large @xmath328 this gives a faithful representation of an easy - plane spin-@xmath24 antiferromagnet , and the universal physics is expected to be unchanged at smaller @xmath328 .",
    "clearly a superfluid phase of the bosons is possible ( and corresponds to the xy ordered phase in the magnet analogy ) .",

    "this can bring out the unusual physics of ising ordering in the vortex cores discussed earlier in sec .",
    "[ sec : ordered ] .",
    "let us consider the structure in an applied _",
    "orbital _ magnetic field @xmath329 .",
    "the qcp at zero field describes a transition between a superfluid phase and a bond - centered striped phase .",
    "suppose the system is on the superfluid ( xy ordered ) side of the qcp , and a small magnetic field is applied ( we use the internal field @xmath329 ) .",
    "this field produces vortices , separated by an average distance @xmath330 , where @xmath331 is the flux quantum , and @xmath332 is the boson charge . in the weak field limit",
    ", where the length @xmath333 is large , one expects these vortices to form an abrikosov lattice , since the long - range logarithmic interactions between vortices dominate their kinetic energy .",
    "now suppose one is near the qcp , so that the correlation length @xmath76 is large . to a first approximation",
    ", one can neglect instanton events , and treat the ising quantum number of the vortices as conserved .",
    "then each vortex in the abrikosov lattice has a definite ising  charge \" , and hence the system as a whole some sort of ising magnetic order .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the basic interactions between these ising `` spins '' are antiferromagnetic , and that these interactions decay rapidly when the two vortices in question are separated by a distance much larger than @xmath76 .",
    "these interactions arise because the two types of vortices carry opposite gauge flux @xmath334 .",
    "this gauge flux is confined to a region of the size of the ( gauge ) `` penetration depth '' .",
    "since the gauge field fluctuations are part of the quantum critical theory , this penetration depth is of the @xmath335 . due to the maxwell term in the action ,",
    "two nearby vortices have lowest energy with opposite gauge fluxes ( and hence smaller total gauge flux ) , provided the two fluxes overlap .",
    "a mean field analysis following abrikosov leads to the same conclusion as discussed below .",
    "in particular , consider the lagrangian @xmath336 ( in eqn .",
    "[ sz ] ) for the @xmath34 fields .",
    "we are interested in @xmath48 ( in eqn .",
    "[ eq : epterm ] ) , and it is convenient to consider the limit @xmath337 , with @xmath338 . for @xmath339 ,",
    "the mean field theory ( which neglects fluctuations of @xmath340 ) comprises simply of two decoupled copies of abrikosov s lattices for @xmath110 and @xmath108 .",
    "thus the solution consists of a triangular vortex lattice in each @xmath34 , with lattice spacing @xmath341 ( since each @xmath34 has charge @xmath342 ) .",
    "these two lattices are completely decoupled in this approximation . with @xmath343 ,",
    "the energy is minimized when the integral of @xmath344 is smallest .",
    "this is accomplished by placing the @xmath110 and @xmath108 vortices as far apart as possible , so that @xmath344 is reduced over the maximum spatial area .",
    "the solution is to choose the two triangular @xmath34 vortex lattices as the two sublattices of a honeycomb lattice .",
    "this corresponds to an antiferromagnetic orientation of the ising vortex cores on the honeycomb .    to establish the stability of this order",
    ", we must reconsider the effect of instanton events in this phase .",
    "the important events are _ single _ instantons , which act like a transverse field on the ising quantum number .",
    "while these average away in the continuum theory , the finite lattice spacing @xmath345 provides an upper length cutoff for the oscillations of the single instanton fugacity , which can therefore have an effect . near the qcp , it is possible for both @xmath333 and @xmath76 to be large , but to have @xmath333 not much greater than @xmath76 . in this limit , which we consider , the overlap of the vortex cores is strong , hence the ising antiferromagnetic `` exchange energy '' between neighboring vortices is large , _",
    "i.e. _ of order @xmath277 by scaling . the effective transverse field on the vortices is more difficult to estimate . in a mean field treatment ,",
    "one simply averages the oscillating instanton fugacity over the two dimensional @xmath346 using some smooth envelope function .",
    "this gives a transverse field @xmath347 .",
    "fluctuation effects may be expected to further decrease this field .",
    "hence , the transverse field is much weaker for large @xmath76 than the antiferromagnetic coupling between cores .",
    "thus we arrive at the remarkable conclusion that the vortex state near the qcp exhibits antiferromagnetic ising lro of the staggered ising magnetization of the vortex cores .",
    "note that this analysis applies when the magnetic length @xmath348 .",
    "for very small fields , or further from the qcp , @xmath349 , and the antiferromagnetic interactions between cores ( @xmath350 ) decay exponentially , while the transverse field is likely of power law form .",
    "hence for very small fields it seems probable that the ising cores become disordered . in this case , the physical manifestation of the long - lived ising staggered magnetization is the presence of a low energy `` antibonding '' excitation of each vortex .",
    "clearly , upon increasing the quantum fluctuations , this vortex lattice must disappear , since the vbs state on the other side of the critical point is an orbital paramagnet , _",
    "i.e. _ no change in symmetry occurs on applying a weak field to it .",
    "hence there is at least one phase boundary separating the ising ordered vortex lattice from the vbs phase that persists at @xmath351 .",
    "we will not address this `` vortex lattice melting '' physics here , except to say that first order , continuous , and multi - stage transitions ( with intermediate partially ordered phases ) are all possible in principle ( and difficult to distinguish between on purely theoretical grounds ) .      in the bulk of this paper we have focused on the spin-@xmath24 square lattice antiferromagnetic model .",
    "here we briefly discuss the fate of higher spin models on the square lattice .",
    "it should be clear by now that the answers depend crucially on the haldane phases that obtain for higher spin . in the isotropic model , if @xmath352 then the monopoles are quadrupled .",
    "thus for all such values of the spin , a direct second order nel - vbs transition described by the same deconfined critical theory as for spin-@xmath24 obtains . if @xmath353 , then there are _ no _ oscillating phase factors for the monopoles .",
    "this has the consequence that a translation symmetric quantum paramagnetic state is now possible .",
    "the transition to this state from the nel state will be described by the usual lgw o(3 ) fixed point ( _ i.e. _ with monopoles present ) . if @xmath354 then the appropriate haldane phases lead to doubling of monopole events .",
    "now confined paramagnetic states necessarily break lattice symmetries . whether a direct second order nel - vbs transition is allowed or not depends on the scaling dimension of the 2-monopole operator at the monopole - suppressed fixed point .",
    "if this is irrelevant , then the same deconfined critical theory as for spin-@xmath24 will obtain .",
    "it is interesting to consider the spin-@xmath35 case in the presence of some easy plane anisotropy .",
    "this may equivalently be viewed as a model of bosons at integer filling - unlike in the isotropic limit , a translation symmetric confined paramagnet is clearly possible . a direct transition between the xy ordered phase and",
    "such a paramagnet is clearly possible and will be in the usual @xmath355 xy universality class .",
    "however , presumably the interesting question even in the easy plane case is whether a direct second order transition is possible between the xy ordered phase and a lattice symmetry _ broken _ confined paramagnet with bond order . to answer this question and to obtain a description of such a paramagnet , it is convenient to start from the isotropic limit and introduce weak easy plane anisotropy . in the isotropic",
    "limit the confined paramagnetic states will break lattice symmetries and this will be preserved upon turning on some easy plane anisotropy . in a cp@xmath29 description , there will now be monopole berry phases that oscillate on two sublattices of the dual lattice .",
    "we may now dualize in the easy plane limit to the meron vortex degrees of freedom . in this description",
    "it is clear that the translation broken vbs state is again described by an equal amplitude condensate of both vortex fields .",
    "now the instanton term converts two merons of one kind into two of the other kind _",
    "i.e. _ the co - efficient of the @xmath115 term in eq .",
    "( [ crtny ] ) is @xmath356 $ ] , with @xmath357 .",
    "the relevance / irrelevance of this at the self - dual , easy plane , non - compact cp@xmath29 fixed point will determine whether a direct second order transition obtains or not : this question remains open at present .",
    "note that near the transition to the usual paramagnet with no broken symmetries there will only be single species of vortex with a featureless ` paramagnetic ' core . on the other hand near the transition to the vbs phase there will once again be two species of ( nearly ) stable vortices with cores that have very long - lived ising order ( if as discussed above such a direct continuous transition is possible ) .",
    "the considerations of this paper generalize readily to other two dimensional bipartite lattices .",
    "for instance on the honeycomb lattice the haldane berry phase calculation implies that all monopole events are tripled ( rather than quadrupled as on the square lattice ) .",
    "this implies that the issue of whether or not a direct second order transition described by a ` deconfined ' critical point obtains between the nel and vbs phases is determined by the scaling dimension of the 3-monopole operator at the monopole - suppressed fixed point . unlike the square lattice it is however less clear that the 3-monopole operator will be irrelevant .",
    "for instance for the @xmath213 sj model , the higgs - vbs transition is determined by the @xmath358 clock universality class which is distinct from the xy universality class . in other words",
    "the 3-fold anisotropy which represents instantons is _ relevant _ at the deconfined fixed point at @xmath213 . at large-@xmath45",
    "all monopoles continue to be irrelevant .",
    "the fate of the physical models ( with and without easy plane anisotropy ) can only be settled by direct numerical computation of the scaling dimension of the @xmath359-monopole operator .      in this paper , we have focused on the properties of spin-@xmath24 antiferromagnets with full su(2 ) spin rotational symmetry , or its easy - plane reduction to u(1 ) .",
    "these two cases are amenable to analysis due , on the one hand , to natural continuations of the su(2 ) invariant cp@xmath29 representation to cp@xmath217 , and through standard xy duality .",
    "one may also ask whether similar deconfined critical points might arise in systems with easy - axis ( i.e. ising ) anisotropy , which also retain the u(1 ) subgroup of su(2 ) . unfortunately",
    ", this limit is much less amenable to microscopic duality transformations on the lattice level , and so it is difficult to make firm statements . while some of us suspect that no deconfined critical behavior is likely in this case , it is nevertheless of interest to present candidate field theories for such deconfined transitions .",
    "very navely , one may attempt to begin with the cp@xmath29 representation of the quantum antiferromagnet , and simply change the sign of the anisotropy term , taking @xmath360 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epterm ] ) . in a mean - field analysis of the continuum field theory of eq .",
    "( [ sz ] ) , including anisotropy of this sign would indeed have the desired effect of yielding a transition between an ising ordered phase ( for @xmath361 ) and a vbs phase ( for @xmath362  actually one navely obtains the coulomb phase of the gauge theory , neglecting the dangerously irrelevant instantons ) .",
    "there are , however , several caveats to this candidate theory that must be mentioned .",
    "first , supposing the gauge field @xmath49 non - compact , fluctuation effects are known in some situations ( _ e.g. _ the classical abrikosov transition between the normal state and vortex lattice at @xmath363 ) to drive navely continuous transitions involving gauge fields first order . while we believe this does not occur in the cases of su(2 ) invariance and xy anisotropy , these conclusions are based on several exact dualities and the numerical results of ref .",
    "directly on models in which instantons have been suppressed , and direct simulations of cp@xmath29 models coupled to non compact gauge fields @xcite .",
    "second , even if the non - compact transition is continuous , to constitute a stable deconfined qcp , it must be stable to the ( quadrupled ) instanton events allowed by the microscopic compact model .    at present",
    "we do not have supporting evidence in favor of either of these two conditions .",
    "it would be of some interest to develop a semiclassical description of the above scenario to better evaluate it in physically intuitive terms .",
    "we note that xy anisotropy , for very simple reasons , favors a `` deconfined '' critical scenario .",
    "in particular , weak xy anisotropy converts the topological defects ( solitons ) of the antiferromagnet from skyrmions to merons , `` fractionalizing '' them already in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "adding ising anisotropy instead renders the topological defects local `` droplets '' , or domains of antiphase ordering .",
    "these can apparently be viewed as distorted skyrmions , in which the smooth rotation from the anti - aligned core to infinity is replaced by a domain wall of finite width .",
    "thus there is no fractionalization of the topological defects in the ising antiferromagnet , although they do appear to carry the integer skyrmion quantum number .    nevertheless , the action in eqs .",
    "( [ sz ] ) and ( [ eq : epterm ] ) appears to describe a putative deconfined ising af to vbs transition .",
    "there is clearly no self - dual description of this qcp , since neglecting instantons , the vbs phase is replaced by a coulomb phase with a gapless photon , while the ising af has no gapless excitations .",
    "formally , however , one may wonder what physics might be represented by considering the mathematically similar `` anisotropy '' in the dual meron theory , _",
    "i.e. _ taking @xmath364 in eq .",
    "( [ crtny ] ) . provided",
    "this transition remains continuous in @xmath365 dimensions and the @xmath115 term remains irrelevant in this case , this would describe a _",
    "different _ quantum phase transition .",
    "in particular , for @xmath366 , the ground state has no vortices and there is a meissner response ( maxwell term for @xmath104 ) , hence it describes an xy superfluid . for @xmath367 , with @xmath360 , one or the other ( not both ) types of merons",
    "condense and the @xmath104 gauge field develops a higgs mass .",
    "hence this describes a non - superfluid state . from table  [",
    "tab : dual ] , one sees that the non - zero expectation value of @xmath368 implies ising af order .",
    "thus this critical point describes a putative direct continuous transition between xy and ising antiferromagnets .",
    "thus these two theories describe different potential routes of `` disordering '' a quantum ising antiferromagnet with u(1 ) spin - rotation symmetry , either to a vbs phase or an xy antiferromagnetic phase",
    ". if they are indeed continuous , with the instanton fugacity and @xmath115 term respectively irrelevant , they are not self - dual but instead dual to one another",
    ". it would be interesting to determine with more certainty whether these putative critical theories can survive fluctuation effects .",
    "we note that the numerical simulations of ref .  observed a first order transition between vbs and ising antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "while this does not rule out the possibility of a continuous transition in other microscopic models , it is perhaps some evidence to the contrary .",
    "we now briefly discuss the implications of the phenomena discussed in this paper for experiments on quantum magnets .",
    "what are some good signatures of these phenomena in experiments ?",

    "a fine - tuning is required@xcite to prevent the generation of the @xmath510 term in this argument , and for the present model we can now easily see that this fine tuning is automatic at the critical point of the gauge theory in eq .",

    "the key is to note that the logarithmic interaction between the monopoles is equivalent to the statement that the correlators of @xmath511 decay as a power law ( at the fixed point without monopoles ) . in the theory of the monopoles in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdualchi ] ) , the @xmath512 field is at the critical point of the 3d @xmath513 model .",
    "the rpa theory approximates this non - trivial interacting critical theory by an equivalent gaussian theory , which also happens to give power law correlations for the @xmath512 field ( this is a property of the @xmath514 form ) . in the full theory in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdualchi ] ) , the screening of monopole interactions is associated with corrections higher order in @xmath115 . in the context of conformal perturbation theory about the critical point of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdualchi ] ) , however , it is clear that these higher order effects in @xmath115 actually represent shifts in the position of the critical point , and not any changes in the scaling dimensions of operators .",
    "hence for the nel - vbs transition we conclude that the ` nave ' computation of monopole scaling dimensions in the large @xmath45 limit @xcite is actually correct , and that we should neglect screening between multiple monopoles in determining this scaling dimension .",
    "the latter effects are more correctly accounted for by shifting the position of the critical point .",
    "note that for the @xmath501 case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : znmodel ] ) considered in ref .  , computation of the scaling dimension of the monopole operator using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sdualchi ] ) shows that monopoles are relevant at the critical point .",
    "indeed , they round out the transition to a crossover , and the monopoles are always in a screened plasma phase . so the conclusions of refs",
    ".   for this case are correct , but not for completely sound reasons .                                                                              at large-@xmath45 even the single monopole operator is irrelevant so that even without berry phases a ` deconfined ' critical fixed point obtains .",
    "however this is special to large-@xmath45 and does not hold at @xmath213 ( or in the easy plane limit at @xmath214 ) .",
