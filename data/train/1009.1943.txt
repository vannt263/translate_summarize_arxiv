    "according to our standard structure formation scenarios based on the dark matter ( dm ) models , clusters of galaxies , the most massive virialized objects in the universe , form from the largest positive density fluctuations , thus their formation and evolution are sensitive to the underlying cosmological model .",
    "taking advantage of this feature , clusters have been used extensively to determine cosmological parameters ( e.g. , henry 2000 ; allen et al .",

    "it is crucial to understand the physics of clusters out to their virial radii and beyond .",
    "the observed large - scale distribution of the intra - cluster gas ( icg ) and its evolution can be directly compared to predictions of cosmological structure formation models and so constrain them .",
    "also , when using the x - ray / sz method to derive distances to clusters directly , and thus determining cosmological parameters , the large scale distribution of the icg has to be known well since incorrect icg models lead to bias in the determination of the distance and thus in cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a summary of systematic errors see @xcite ) .",

    "thermal bremsstrahlung is generated by the scattering of two particles ( an electron and an ion ) in the icg , thus the x - ray emission in massive ( hot ) clusters , where this is the dominant emission process , is proportional to the square of the electron density , since the ion density is proportional to the electron density ( e.g. , sarazin 1988 ) .",
    "the sz effect , the inverse - compton scattering of cold photons of the cmb by electrons in the hot icg , is proportional to the electron density ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1980 ; for recent reviews see rephaeli 1995 ; birkinshaw 1999 ; and carlstrom , holder & reese 2002 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "x - ray observations are more sensitive to the inner parts of clusters , while sz observations are relatively more sensitive to the outer regions .",

    "we measure the sz signal , which is proportional to the line - of - sight ( los ) integral of the electron pressure , and the x - ray surface brightness , which is proportional to the los integral of the x - ray emissivity .",

    "also , due to projection effects , measurement errors , etc . , the distribution of the icg determined from x - ray measurements might be biased .",
    "models used to describe the x - ray observations of clusters are typically @xmath1 models for the density distribution , @xmath6 , where the spatial extent is determined by the core radius , @xmath7 , and the fall off by the exponent , @xmath1 ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) ; with either constant temperature ( isothermal @xmath1 models ) , or a gradually declining temperature as a function of the distance from the cluster center .",

    "we use only projections of relaxed clusters which seem to show no contamination by filaments or distortion due to projection effects ( projections x and y of cl1 and projection y of cl2 ) , and a non - relaxed cluster , cl3 , in a most relaxed projection , projection x. we derive simulated visibilities for two - patch observations as    @xmath117    where the on - source visibilities , @xmath118 , are    @xmath119    and the off - source ( background ) visibilities , @xmath120 , are    @xmath121    where @xmath122  is the visibility of the sz signal , @xmath114 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , @xmath125 are two sets of visibilities of the cmb fluctuations and noise ( different for on- and off - source observations ) .",
    "we assumed that the cmb fluctuation fields for the two patches ( about one degree apart ) are uncorrelated , which is a conservative assumption : this way we somewhat overestimate the noise due to the cmb .",
    "since our models are spherically symmetric , we have no constraints on them from the imaginary part of the model visibilities ( the imaginary part is identically zero ) , therefore we work only with the real part of the visibilities .",
    "note that in real applications the imaginary parts can be used to check the amplitude of the cmb fluctuations in the field , assess non - sphericity of the cluster and the pointing accuracy .    as an illustration , in figure  [ f : f7 ]",
    "we show the radial profile of the real part , @xmath126 , of the azimuthally averaged simulated visibilities of one realization of a two - patch observation for cl1 in projection  y for the 90 and 98  ghz amiba channels ( channels a and b , ho et al . 2009 ) as a function of @xmath127 .",
    "since the length scale for the visibility data is in units of the observing wavelength , the visibilities are represented by two sets of curves .",
    "the red diamonds and green squares with error bars represent visibilities for channel a and b. the error bars represent the _ rms _ of the azimuthally averaged real part of the visibilities at the amiba13  baselines .",
    "visibilities of other projections of cl1 and projections of cl2 and cl3 with no contamination from filaments are very similar due to the structural similarity among the cluster sz images in these projections ( see figures  [ f : f3 ] , [ f : f4 ] and [ f : f5 ] ) .",
    "we use non - isothermal double @xmath1 models truncated at the virial radius to describe the icg . we determine the best - fit parameters using likelihood functions . our model for the sz surface brightness distributions ( equations  [ e : dens ] and [ e : temp ] ) has eleven free parameters : ten shape parameters , @xmath128 , and one amplitude , @xmath129 .",
    "unfortunately , due to limited spatial resolution , fov and receiver noise , we do not expect to be able to determine all ten parameters using amiba13 .",
    "thus , similarly to @xcite , we reduce the number of free parameters in our models . we proceed the following way : first we determine the shape parameters for the central part of the cluster , @xmath42 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath62 , @xmath130 , and the core radius for the large scale distribution , @xmath7  from simulated x - ray observations ( fixing @xmath131 , @xmath132 @xmath3  and @xmath55 based on our results from numerical simulations ) .",
    "we assume that the x - ray surface density and temperature are determined with acceptable accuracy only in the central part of the cluster , to 0.5@xmath3  and 0.2@xmath3 .",
    "therefore @xmath34  can not be determined from fits to the x - ray temperature profile , and the x - ray emissivity within 0.5@xmath3  gives no useful constraints on the large scale distribution of the temperature .",
    "having determined the shape parameters for the central part , we derive constraints on the temperature scale parameter , @xmath34 , from simulated amiba13  visibilities .",
    "we calculate the predicted integrated x - ray flux / pixel for our x - ray model as    @xmath133    where @xmath134 is our cluster model and @xmath135 is the background .",
    "we calculate @xmath134 as    @xmath136    where @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the central integrated flux / pixel for the two model components , the normalizations are @xmath139 and @xmath140 , and    @xmath141    where @xmath142 , and the cut off in the los is @xmath143 .",
    "we ignore the error in the x - ray background , @xmath135 since it is negligible relative to other sources of error , such as , for example , errors due to azimuthal averaging .",
    "we experimented with the likelihood ratio for poisson distribution and mighell s @xmath144 statistic ( see mighell 1999 for a detailed analysis ) in fitting this structure .",
    "we found that the fitted parameters obtained by these two methods are virtually identical .",
    "therefore we decided to use the poisson likelihood ratio test :    @xmath145    where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the observed and expected numbers of photons .",
    "we derive spectroscopic - like x - ray temperature profiles , @xmath148 , for our simulated clusters using the weighting scheme of mazzotta et al ( 2004 ) , which has been shown to provide temperature profiles similar to those observed with chandra  and xmm ( nagai et al .",

    "the error bars represent instrumental errors of 60 hour observations . the best - fit @xmath1 model is also shown for the two channels ( red solid and green dashed lines ) .",
    "[ f : f7 ] ]        since the shape parameters of the inner part of clusters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath7 , @xmath62 , and @xmath130 , are not sensitive to the large - scale distribution of the temperature ( heavily weighted towards the center of the cluster ) , we determine them fixing @xmath12 , @xmath155 and @xmath55 ( based on our results from fitting to the density and temperature distributions of our simulated clusters ) . in our case , since @xmath12 , the x - ray emissivity , which is proportional to @xmath156 in the outer parts of the cluster , drops about six orders of magnitude from the cluster center to the virial radius .",
    "therefore a moderate change in @xmath3  ( say 20% ) causes only an insignificant change in the x - ray signal ( equation  [ e : intxray ] ) due to a change in the upper limit , @xmath157 ( except around @xmath3 where the x - ray signal is negligible ; see figures  [ f : f3 ] , [ f : f4 ] and [ f : f5 ] ) . for our purposes , therefore , we fix the value of @xmath3  assuming that an estimate for its value with a 20% accuracy is available from other measurements .",

    "we use the likelihood function for the x - ray emission ( equation  [ e : likex ] ) to determine @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath7 , and then the likelihood function for the x - ray temperature ( equation  [ e : liketemp ] ) to determine @xmath62 , and @xmath130 , then we iterate over these steps ( usually only two steps are needed ) .",
