    "<S> 2    the relationship between the quantum properties of disordered and classically chaotic systems has been the focus of much recent research@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for this is that both types of system show the same underlying behavior  their energy spectra in appropriate regions have statistics given by random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite . the spectral properties in these universal regions are well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge now is to understand whether generic features also emerge in the deviations from universality . answering this question </S>",
    "<S> is made difficult because two very different languages are used to characterize the two types of system . in quantum disordered systems </S>",

    "<S> the field theory technique is rather formal and somewhat opaque physically , but has a well - defined perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the trace formula appears to be more physically transparent in that one is summing over classical trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> however , this sum is difficult to perform , its convergence properties are not well understood , and no controlled expansion is currently available . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural that one should attempt to use the strengths of one language to compensate the weaknesses of the other .    </S>",
    "<S> one recent attempt was to try to carry over the powerful calculational techniques developed for the disordered systems to the chaotic systems@xcite . in the most consistent form , one averages over a certain energy interval to generate a field - theoretical functional in the wigner representation ( the `` ballistic '' sigma - model ) . from this one </S>",

    "<S> in addition the leading - order perturbative term@xcite in the non - ergodic regime gives a result equivalent to that obtained in the diagonal approximation@xcite to the gutzwiller trace formula@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same approximation when applied to the disordered systems@xcite also gives the leading order perturbative term first derived in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> one therefore expects that higher order perturbative terms in quantum chaotic systems would be analogous to those occurring in disordered systems ( where they are known as weak - localization corrections ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ballistic sigma model is , however , ill - defined in the ultraviolet limit , making perturbative analysis currently ambiguous .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> various authors@xcite have proceeded in the opposite direction , and developed semiclassical methods for the quantum disordered system . the goal is to gain a more intuitive picture of phenomena such as weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show how the diagrammatics for spectral correlations in disordered conductors can be rewritten in terms of particle trajectories which self - intersect in real space . </S>",
    "<S> each diagram for the two - level correlation function is represented as consisting of two trajectories that are identical everywhere except at self - intersection regions , where they are rejoined in different ways . as the two trajectories are identical for most of their length , </S>",
    "<S> they are phase coherent , and interfere constructively . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation parameter , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the the dimensionless conductance , can be understood as the probability for a self - intersection to occur . </S>",
    "<S> the great advantage of this approach is the drastic reduction in the number of diagrams which occur in a given order of perturbation theory this reduction arises because our approach does not distinguish the starting points of the ( closed ) trajectories , whereas the standard approach does . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when translated into field theory language , this means that the two - level correlation function , @xmath0 , is the second derivative with respect to energy , @xmath4 , of the free energy , @xmath1 . as a particular problem </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the two - level correlation function to three - loop order in perturbation theory , which yields the leading order level statistics for the unitary system in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> finally we show that the three - loop results for @xmath0 in both unitary and orthogonal systems can be derived from a one - parameter scaling hypothesis in which the renormalized conductance @xmath5 is substituted into the one - loop result . </S>",
    "<S> note that in our approach we are using the trajectory picture to classify the field theory diagrammatics in contrast to the work discussed in the previous paragraph where field theory is being used to classify periodic orbits .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the relation of the picture of trajectories to the perturbation expansion of @xmath0 which is defined by @xmath6here @xmath7 is the density of states per unit volume which can be written , given the spectrum @xmath8 of the system , as @xmath9and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mean level spacing . here </S>",

    "<S> the semiclassical approach allows one to write @xmath7 as a sum over classical paths by means of the gutzwiller trace formula@xcite , @xmath14where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the amplitude and action of the @xmath17-th periodic orbit at energy @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> one can then substitute this semiclassical formula into the definition of the two - level correlation function , @xmath0 , and take the fourier transform to obtain the spectral form factor , @xmath19 , @xmath20since all factors vary slowly with @xmath18 except the action @xmath16 , one expands @xmath21 to first order to obtain @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath23 is the period of the orbit @xmath17 .    to proceed further berry@xcite introduced the diagonal approximation assuming that only terms with @xmath24 contribute to the sum in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> such a diagonal approximation was shown @xcite to reproduce the leading order perturbative contribution@xcite to @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> the question that we address here is how to get regular corrections to the diagonal approximation which are due to contributions of relatively long trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> such corrections are of fundamental importance , especially for two - dimensional disordered systems : the leading order term corresponding to the diagonal approximation vanishes@xcite for @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility of getting the regular corrections could be interesting in a much wider context . to evaluate the corrections </S>",
    "<S> one has to consider pairs of paths with _ almost _ equal actions , @xmath27 , like in the diagonal approximation , but allow @xmath25 .    to construct the _ weak diagonal approximation _ which allows for such pairs of trajectories we start with a path that self - intersects in real space at one or more points . </S>",
    "<S> at a point of intersection we break up the path and make different trajectories by joining the pieces together in different ways . </S>",
    "<S> we see at once that this gives rise to a perturbation expansion , with the perturbative order given by the number of loops in real space created by self - intersections , and the perturbation parameter given by the probability of having a self - intersection . in the case of a disordered electronic system </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that this expansion is none other than the usual field - theoretical loop expansion . before we do this , </S>",
    "<S> let us speculate on the nature of this expansion for a generic chaotic system .    in this case </S>",
    "<S> the above picture of self - intersecting trajectories requires clarification . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the picture of trajectories is formulated in phase space rather than in real space </S>",
    "<S> . of course , classical trajectories which are identical along part of their length in phase space can not diverge in the way discussed above  this process is quantum mechanical in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty principle means that phase space is coarse - grained into boxes with size of order @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> two trajectories which were originally nearly identical ( i.e.  passing through the same phase space boxes ) start to deviate significantly at the ehrenfest time , @xmath29 , due to quantum processes such as diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> then we can make pairs of piecewise identical trajectories as described above . </S>",
    "<S> for this picture to make sense we need to work at time - scales greater than @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been noted in ref .   which recently considered the weak localization correction in a disordered system where the ehrenfest time is determined by the diffraction at randomly distributed scattering spheres . in the usual model of a disordered conductor with point - like scatterers @xmath29 coincides with the elastic scattering time @xmath30 since the particle s direction is totally randomized after each scattering . </S>",
    "<S> in general , we expect that the classification of trajectories in the weak diagonal approximation might be valid for chaotic system with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ergodic time scale at which the trajectory samples the entire phase space . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is necessary in order to treat the self - intersection region as a perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> it simply means that the length of almost identical regions of the two trajectories is much larger than the length of the self - intersection region .    at time </S>",
    "<S> scales @xmath33 , one expects completely universal behavior which is described by the random matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this has been conjectured by bohigas et al @xcite and partially proved by andreev et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this universal behavior is completely non - perturbative and can not be described by the diagonal approximation . moreover , even for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the heisenberg time , the diagonal approximation does not reproduce the deviation from the linear behavior of @xmath19 known from the random matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that we can exactly allow for this deviation within our weak diagonal approximation .    at time </S>",
    "<S> scales @xmath36 , one expects non - universal corrections to the diagonal approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear whether this is true for a generic chaotic system . </S>",
    "<S> attempts@xcite to generate these corrections within the ballistic nonlinear @xmath37 model@xcite have led to results vanishing to all orders in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> these results are dubious , however , because they depend strongly on the short - time regularization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , there exist regularizations where the corrections do not vanish and are totally governed by short - time processes at time scales @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the ballistic @xmath37 model itself might not take into account all relevant quantum processes .    </S>",
    "<S> in the disordered conductor these corrections can be calculated both for @xmath33 and for @xmath39 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 is the time taken for an electron to diffuse to the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the trajectory picture is naturally related to a standard diagrammatic expansion and , moreover , allows considerable simplifications in this expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now draw all closed trajectories with up to two self - intersections regions and show their relation to the diagrams up to three - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> let us first rewrite a pair of identical ( up to discrete symmetries of the ensemble ) trajectories , which correspond to berry s diagonal approximation , @xcite as a diagram in field theory language .    </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) the 1-loop diagram for the free energy @xmath1 , which consists of pairs of trajectories that are identical up to time reversal symmetry . in the field theory language it consists of a single closed wavy line . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the same diagram in the disordered metal . </S>",
    "<S> since the closed wavy line in ( a ) consists of a sum over impurity ladders , and the diagram with @xmath41 impurity ladders has symmetry factor @xmath42 , the ladder gives logarithmic contribution @xmath43 .    </S>",

    "<S> first we show the two different ways of linking up the paths at the self - intersection point </S>",
    "<S> . then we rewrite this in the field theory language so that regions where the two paths are identical become wavy lines , whilst the region of self - intersection becomes a closed box . </S>",
    "<S> finally we twist the latter diagram into its usual form .    </S>",
    "<S> the pair of identical or time - reversed trajectories becomes a diffusion or cooperon propagator , respectively , drawn as a wavy line . </S>",
    "<S> this yields the one - loop diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - loop case is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 and involves one self - intersection region . </S>",
    "<S> at this point the paths can be linked up in two different ways , and the diagram consists of these two trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> again we rewrite in field theory language with the identical or time - reversed portions of path becoming diffusion or cooperon propagators . </S>",
    "<S> the region around the self - intersection becomes an effective interaction between these propagators known as a hikami box@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we put arrows on the trajectories to show their direction of traversal we see that they go in the same direction over part of the diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this means that time - reversal invariance is required for their actions to be identical . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is no two - loop term in the unitary case , where time - reversal invariance is broken ; in fact , all even loop contributions vanish for the same reason .    </S>",
    "<S> the three - loop case is shown in fig .  3 , and involves two self - intersections . </S>",
    "<S> the situation here is more complicated since there are three distinct topological ways for two self - intersections to occur . </S>",
    "<S> they can occur either at the same point , or at two different points @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> there are two distinct orderings in which the trajectory can be traversed  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> finally there is more than one way of linking up the partial paths to form trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> there are five diagrams in total : @xmath48 has @xmath46 form ; @xmath49 and @xmath50 have intersection at only one point ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 have @xmath47 form . </S>",
    "<S> putting arrows on the trajectories we find that only @xmath49 and @xmath51 contribute to the unitary case .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that the above procedure can obviously be generalized to any order of perturbation theory , and is a powerful way of ensuring that all contributions have been considered .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now relate these pictures of semiclassical trajectories to the standard diagrammatic approach@xcite for evaluating @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is the expression for the density of states , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the five 3-loop diagrams for the free energy @xmath1 corresponding to paths with two self - intersections . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the format of fig .  2 , showing first the pairs of distinct trajectories ; then rewriting these with wavy lines representing regions where the two paths are identical , and closed boxes at the self - intersection points ; then finally twisting the latter diagrams in their usual form .    </S>",

    "<S> equation ( [ reqn ] ) directly corresponds to the semiclassical expressions ( [ sff ] ) and ( [ scsff ] ) , since @xmath59 is the quantum mechanical propagator for a particle of energy @xmath18 to start and finish at the same point @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we can then represent @xmath59 as the sum of all closed paths while @xmath61 will be the sum of all closed paths traversed in the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> averaging over disorder results in the vanishing of all contributions apart from those corresponding to pairs of coherent paths . </S>",
    "<S> this coherence arises when the pair of paths involves scattering off the same impurities although not necessarily in the same order . </S>",

    "<S> the closed paths for @xmath62 and @xmath63 are identical , apart from their different starting points @xmath64 and @xmath65 , while the impurity lines form a ladder which corresponds to a diffusion propagator @xmath66or its time - reversed counterpart , a cooperon .    the key feature of the diagram for @xmath0 generated in such a way , fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this is identical to fig . 1 except that the starting points of the two trajectories , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> in general inserting points in such a way yields many more diagrams for @xmath0 than for @xmath1 .    </S>",

    "<S> contrarily , there are no starting points on the semiclassical diagrams of fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , one can obtain the diagram of fig .  4 from the semiclassical picture of fig .  1 by inserting points @xmath64 and @xmath65 into different electron lines in all possible ways . </S>",
    "<S> inserting an external point is equivalent to taking a derivative with respect to energy : inserting @xmath64 replaces @xmath69 by @xmath70 , which can be achieved by the action of @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , inserting @xmath65 gives the same result as @xmath72 . after averaging @xmath0 depends only upon @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one may represent it as the second derivative of a certain function @xmath1 , @xmath74we will show below that this @xmath1 corresponds to the ` free energy ' of the appropriate field - theoretical functional . </S>",

    "<S> the only difference between these higher order contributions to @xmath0 and semiclassical diagrams in figs .  </S>",

    "<S> we perform the average over disorder by the replica trick . </S>",

    "<S> we can now apply the usual perturbative methods to expand @xmath1 in powers of the coupling constant ( inverse dimensionless conductance ) @xmath86 and then apply the relation ( [ rf ] ) to obtain @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the great advantage of this method is the much smaller number of diagrams we need to evaluate . </S>",
    "<S> for example , </S>",
    "<S> in three - loop perturbation theory for the orthogonal case there are 5 diagrams for @xmath1 compared to @xmath87 for @xmath0 .    in previous work@xcite a source field for @xmath7 has been introduced with a complex index structure similar to that necessary for calculating the conductance moments . </S>",
    "<S> a considerable simplification here is that @xmath4 itself suffices as a source field for calculating @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that this method can not be extended to the supersymmetric sigma model@xcite where the free energy is always unity owing to the fact that the supersymmetry is preserved in the effective functional . to break the supersymmetry one must introduce the @xmath88-matrix in the expression for the prefactors , @xmath89 , or equivalently introduce an appropriate source term in the effective functional@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this is straightforward , all ` savings ' in terms of the number of diagrams would be lost . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for perturbative calculations the replicated @xmath90 model turns out to be more economical than the supersymmetric one . </S>",
    "<S> finally we note that the free energy has previously been calculated up to four - loop order@xcite in order to find @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> our result above gives a direct physical meaning to the field - theoretic free energy .    </S>",
    "<S> to generate perturbation theory we must introduce a parameterization of @xmath78 that satisfies the saddle - point constraints . </S>",
    "<S> there are several parameterizations available , and they will give different contributions for a given diagram , but the sum of all contributions at a given order of perturbation theory will always be the same . </S>",
    "<S> the particular one used depends upon the application . </S>",
    "<S> the choice @xmath92reproduces the results of the original impurity diagrammatics in the diffusive regime@xcite , and is thus useful for direct comparison between the results of impurity diagrammatics and the non - linear @xmath90-model . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath93 is an unconstrained @xmath94 matrix with elements of the form appropriate for the given dyson ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> the functional integration is then carried out over the independent variables @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> another parameterization,@xcite @xmath95where @xmath96 has the same properties as before , is more convenient for calculation because many terms then vanish , and the jacobian of the transition from @xmath78 to @xmath96 is unity in the replica limit . </S>",
    "<S> since the jacobian contributes terms necessary to remove ultraviolet divergences , this means that the sum of all terms at any order in perturbation theory will have no ultraviolet divergence and so there is no need for regularization . </S>",
    "<S> considerations in the ergodic regime are also much simpler , since jacobian terms would contribute there . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows we will , therefore , use these parameterization .    </S>",
    "<S> when we substitute a parameterization into the free energy functional @xmath97 $ ] we obtain a sum of vertices , @xmath98=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty { \\cal f}_{2n}[w]\\end{aligned}\\]]where the @xmath99 $ ] vertex contains @xmath100 powers of @xmath96 . the first term @xmath101 is the quadratic part , and leads to the ladder propagators . </S>",
