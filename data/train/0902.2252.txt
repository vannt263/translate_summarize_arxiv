    "the importance of quantum mechanics to modern technology is indisputable .",
    "however , what remains to complete the ` quantum revolution ' @xcite is the exploitation of _ coherent _ quantum mechanics in technological devices as well as the incoherent quantum mechanics responsible for , e.g. , transistor electronics . systems of strongly interacting photons and atoms have long been convenient systems for probing coherent quantum mechanics through the field of quantum optics .",
    "of all the effects between coherently prepared atoms and light , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is often promoted as an important building block for physics and device applications , because eit allows the possibility of large optical nonlinearities accompanied by complete transparency @xcite .",
    "eit is a coherent quantum phenomenon whereby the absorptive and dispersive properties of a three ( or more ) state system can be tailored by using applied electromagnetic fields , and we discuss its properties more fully below .",
    "first observed by boller , imamolu and harris @xcite , some of the proposed applications for eit include magnetometry @xcite , high - efficiency uv generation @xcite , photonic switches @xcite , and optical @xcite quantum gates , and light storage in first - in first out ( fifo ) networks @xcite .",
    "although the medium of choice is usually a vapour cell ( e.g. rb @xcite ) , future technology may be more easily realised with solid - state media .",
    "eit has also been studied in solids @xcite , magneto - optical traps @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    here , we concentrate on the possibility of using the lossless kerr nonlinearity assocatiated with eit for realising a quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurement .",
    "qnd via the cross - kerr effect between two distinct optical modes was originally proposed by imoto , haus and yamamoto @xcite , and invoking the eit induced giant kerr nonlinearity is a popular suggestion for realising a @xmath2 phase shift for such a measurement .",
    "the idea that such a qnd gate could be realised by weak nonlinearities , such as are routinely found in eit systems , _ without _ a full @xmath2 phase shift induced on the detection beam , was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this system ,",
    "the weak nonlinearity is effectively enhanced by the presence of a strong probe beam .",
    "however the earlier proposal did not consider all of the limitations of realistic systems , and in particular did not consider the effect of inhomogeneous broadening of the eit medium : we do so here .",
    "although we are concentrating on qnd measurements , it has been shown that qnd measurements effected by weak nonlinearities can act as a primitive for other quantum gates , @xcite and this directly leads to the qubus @xcite and related schemes for quantum repeaters @xcite and cluster - state generation @xcite .",

    "eit is a manifestation of quantum interference in an atomic system : considering field 1 as a ` pump ' and field 2 as a ` probe ' , absorption of the probe is suppressed due to the coherence induced by the pump .",
    "the coherence gives rise to interference between the dressed states on the @xmath7 transition , and hence a dip in the probe absorption . because the absorption dip is due to a coherent two - photon resonance ( the resonant two - photon transition from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) it can",

    "[ fig:3la ] ( b ) , we require the pulses that describe fields 1 and 3 to be temporally coincident for the maximum cross - kerr interaction ( the classical pump field 2 can be assumed to be derived from a large uniform field , and so is exempt from this criterion ) .",
    "because field 1 is travelling under eit conditions , it will be propagating with extremely slow group velocity : field 3 is not .",
    "we see that the amount of mutual interaction would therefore be expected to be limited by the temporal walk - off of the two pulses .",
    "there have been many suggestions in the literature to counter this effect ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) which invoke varying levels of complexity of the interaction medium .",
    "it is also possible to control group velocity by modification of the medium , e.g. by using tailored photonic bandgap structures @xcite . because we are mainly interested in solid - state implementations",
    ", we will assume that the system is embedded in a photonic - crystal structure where the group velocity as seen by field 3 is tuned by the structure to balance the eit induced group velocity seen by field 1 , and we therefore will not treat this detail further .",
    "although much of our treatment in this paper will be system independent , it is important to note that a major motivation for performing this reappraisal of weak nonlinear gates is the availability of a new material for observing optical eit : diamond containing the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy colour centre ( nv ) .",
    "this material has shown quite remarkable results , including single photon generation ( e.g. @xcite ) , room - temperature rabi oscillations @xcite , and spin - spin coupling @xcite .",
    "eit has been demonstrated in nv diamond in the rf @xcite and optical regimes @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic properties of nv centres can also be modified by fabricating optical structures directly in ultra - nanocrystalline @xcite or single crystal diamond @xcite , by growth on preexisting optical structures @xcite , and also by stark shifting which has been demonstrated on bulk samples @xcite and spectrally resolved centres @xcite .",
    "the time is therefore ripe to examine nv diamond for the goal of optical quantum information processing .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss eit and the properties of coherently driven @xmath3 systems . by including inhomogeneous broadening and expanding about the eit point we are able to derive analytical results for the absorption and dispersion without the usual assumption of weak probe and strong pump fields .",
    "we are also able to determine optimal ratios for pump and probe rabi frequencies . in section [ sect:4la ]",
    "we show the results for cross - kerr nonlinearities in the four - state n system , and in section  [ sect : gates ] we present our main results , which use the results from the preceeding sections to design structures based on diamond containing the nitrogen - vacancy colour centre that should be sufficient to realise a number - discriminating quantum non - demolition operation .",

    "we treat inhomogeneous broadening by considering a distribution of @xmath8 , i.e. the mutual detunings .",
    "as we are only considering inhomogeneity on the excited state distribution , the _ two - photon _ detuning , @xmath12 , does not vary . note",
    "that although we will use terminology such as ` pump ' and ` probe ' , we will usually make no assumption about the relative strength of these fields . in this way our analysis is analogous to the cases treated by wielandy and gaeta on eit in the strong pump regime @xcite or the parametric eit regime @xcite .",

    "this approximation is warranted because of the very long ground state decoherence rates in important systems of interest ( e.g. diamond containing the negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy colour centre @xcite , or rubidium vapour cells @xcite ) but does limit the _ minimum _ rabi frequencies that can be applied to be larger than this decoherence rate .",

    "our analysis focusses on qnd measurement of a weak field with unknown photon number and we show discrimination between 0 , 1 and 2 photons in the unknown field .",
    "in some of the parameter ranges discussed below , we also observe distortions of the probe field . whilst this is not a problem for qnd discrimination",
    ", it may restrict the utility of our discriminator for use in quantum gates @xcite , where the requirement for sequential use of the qnd probe favours regimes where the q - function of the probe is only rotated , and not also distorted by the nonlinear interaction .",
    "we will first describe the appropriate metrics for evaluating the performance of any such gate in a material independent fashion , and then conclude by presenting realistic operating conditions in several potential implementations as a guide for future demonstrations . for clarity , throughout this section we will restrict ourselves to the case that the @xmath138 transition is probed by a weak coherent state , and the @xmath139 transition has the unknown signal field .",
    "one of the most important parameters to determine the strength of the measurement signal is the effective rabi frequency of the unknown pulse .",
