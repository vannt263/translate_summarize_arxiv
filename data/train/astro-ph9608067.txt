    "recent satellite x - ray observations have made clusters of galaxies increasingly important to cosmology as a probe into the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "being massive and rare , their abundance in the local and distant universe carries vital information on the initial density fluctuations and the matter content of the universe ( lubin 1995 ; eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ) . also being relatively young dynamically",
    ", the details of their structures can provide us with some signatures left over from the formation epoch as well as information on the background cosmology ( crone , evrard , & richstone 1994 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; tsai & buote 1995 ) .",
    "a general consensus seems to be that the standard cold dark matter model ( , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) normalized to the cobe dmr measurement of the anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation ( , @xmath11 ) has serious difficulties in explaining the observed properties of x - ray clusters , such as the cluster abundance ( kang 1994 ) , the baryon fraction in clusters ( lubin 1995 ) , and the contribution of cluster emission to the x - ray background ( kang 1994 ; kitayama & suto 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an open cdm model or a flat cdm model with a cosmological constant with a smaller value of @xmath12 seems more consistent with many observations , and so has become popular recently ( cen & ostriker 1994 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) .    although the application of the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) to the hierarchical clustering model of cluster formation has been successful in getting good agreement with the results of @xmath13-body simulations ( lacey & cole 1994 ) , this semi - analytic approach can not include the effects of non - equilibrium hydrodynamics that could be important during some phases in cluster evolution ( kang 1994 ) .",
    "some studies suggest that the amplitude of the density power spectrum , @xmath12 , can be constrained by the local cluster abundance ( eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1995 ) and the range of the allowed value of @xmath3 can be narrowed down by examining the evolution of cluster abundance at low redshifts ( , @xmath14 ) ( bahcall & cen 1992 ; white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ) . despite this , the observational and theoretical / numerical errors involved in such procedures seem to be too big to make any consistent predictions on those key cosmological parameters ( castander 1995 ; luppino & gioia 1995 ; tsai & buote 1995 ) .",
    "it is also unlikely that all crucial physics can be included in any variants of the treatments .",
    "the properties of x - ray clusters , other than the abundance and the baryon fraction mentioned above , which have been investigated for various cosmological models , include the cluster - cluster correlation function ( bahcall & cen 1992 ) , the density and velocity profiles ( crone , evrard , & richstone 1994 ) , and the degree of substructures in the intracluster medium ( icm ) ( tsai & buote 1995 ) .",
    "the latter two , associated with the internal structure of clusters , are closely related with recent mergers and accretion onto the cluster mass scale ( @xmath15mpc ) , so dependences on @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( the power - law index of the initial power spectrum ) , and @xmath12 could be degenerate .",
    "in addition to that , statistical treatments of observed data of those quantities have a harder time discriminating clearly among different cosmological models compared to the statistics of the cluster abundance . even though there are tantalizing possibilities that the various properties of x - ray clusters can indeed be used to unveil the fundamental nature of the universe , further improvements by a factor of at least a few in both theoretical and observational fronts seem to be required in order to make some solid predictions .    in this paper , we have examined one more physical property associated with x - ray clusters , the accretion flow infalling toward the clusters .",
    "matter accretes onto the high density peaks continuously throughout the history of the universe .",
    "its rate on the scale of the cluster mass will be determined by the initial density fluctuations and the background cosmology .",
    "fluctuations continue to grow in the @xmath9 universe , while they stop growing at a redshift @xmath18 in a universe with small @xmath3 ( peebles 1993 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the accretion on larger scales gets stronger for a smaller @xmath17 for a scale - free power spectrum .",
    "crone , evrard , & richstone ( 1994 ) examined the radial velocity profile of the accretion flow through @xmath13-body simulations of different cosmological models with scale - free power spectra .",
    "they found that the density profile is flatter and the accretion regime is stronger for higher @xmath3 and smaller @xmath17 .",
    "if the initial density perturbation is scale - free , the accretion of both baryonic matter and dark matter in the @xmath19 universe can be described semi - analytically with a self - similar solution ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "but in a universe with @xmath20 , the self - similar solution is not possible , since , in addition to the time scale marking the transition of the initial perturbation to the nonlinear regime , another time scale such as the cosmic time @xmath21 when @xmath22 enters the problem .    here",
    ", we use a one - dimensional spherical @xmath13-body code , which can follow the evolution of collisionless dark matter particles , to find the properties of accretion flows onto objects of cluster mass scales in different cosmological models : the einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath19 , the low - density , open universe with @xmath0 , and the low - density , flat universe with @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( from non - zero cosmological constant , @xmath23 ) . while most previous studies on accretion focused on the density profile inside the collapsed objects developed from infall ,",
    "our primary interests lie in the properties of spherical accretion flows outside the objects . in the accretion of both dark matter ( dm ) and baryonic matter ( bm ) , the collisionless dm forms caustics around the overdensity , while the collisional bm forms accretion shocks stopping the infalling material . in this situation , as pointed by bertschinger ( 1985 ) , the position of the accretion shock of the gas with @xmath24 is very close to the position of the first caustic of the dark matter particles .",
    "in addition , since in the region outside the shock the accretion solution for bm is almost identical to that for dm , the infall velocity of bm upstream of the accretion shock can be described by that of the dm .",
    "hence , hydrodynamic calculations to follow bm are not necessary if we are interested only in the position of the accretion shocks and the properties of the accretion flows .",
    "of course , one - dimensional treatments can not include important physics such as virialization in the central region .",
    "three - dimensional simulations ( kang 1994 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; evrard , metzler , & navarro 1995 ) showed that the gas is shock - heated to the virial temperature and then settles into hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) and that the shock separates the hydrostatic central region from the infalling flow .",
    "however , according to navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 ) , where @xmath13-body / sph simulations were used to examine the properties of x - ray clusters in the @xmath9 cdm universe , the one - dimensional , self - similar solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) matches well the density and temperature profiles of their simulated clusters except for the inner central region .",
    "thus , the properties of accretion flow can be efficiently studied by one - dimensional calculations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 we describe the numerical simulations . in ",
    "3 we present the results focusing on the velocity of the accretion flows . in  4 we discuss the implications of the results on cosmology and on cosmic - ray acceleration by the accretion shocks .",
    "details such as the evolution equations and the numerical scheme are given in the appendices .",
    "we follow the evolution of collisionless dark matter particles accreting onto an initial density enhancement in an otherwise homogeneous universe through calculations with a spherical @xmath13-body code .",
    "the equations describing the particle motion and gravity in comoving coordinates and the expansion of the background universe can be found , for example , in peebles ( 1993 ) and are summarized in appendix a. the details of our numerical code are described in appendix b.    the calculations start at the time corresponding to the initial expansion parameter @xmath25 with @xmath26 particles .",
    "initially the particles are at rest and distributed uniformly , except for an excess mass at the origin to initiate the collapse .",
    "so the initial perturbation can be characterized by the _ point - mass _ perturbation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass inside a radius @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a reference mass .",
    "note that the point - mass perturbation can be approximated by the constant power spectrum ( , @xmath31 with @xmath32 ) ( hoffman & shaham 1985 ) .",
    "although a scale - free power spectrum with @xmath33 would represent better the cdm power spectrum on the cluster scale ( see , bardeen 1986 for the cdm power spectrum ) , the constant power spectrum would be a better approximation on scales a bit larger than that . also according to navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 ) , the self - similar solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) with the above initial perturbation represents well the structures of simulated clusters in an @xmath9 universe with the cdm power spectrum except for the inner central region .",
    "the amount of the excess mass , @xmath30 , has been chosen so that at the present epoch about @xmath34 of the particles are placed inside the first caustic .",
    "it requires an excess mass corresponding to @xmath35 particles .",
    "note that the present value of the hubble parameter , or @xmath36 , enters the problem only through the normalization parameters such as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ( see the appendices ) .",
    "so , we can include the dependence on @xmath40 implicitly by expressing the results in term of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ( or equivalently @xmath44 ) .",
    "if we had followed the evolution of bm with @xmath24 as well , its accretion shock would have occurred very close to the first caustic of dm and its accretion velocity outside the shock would have been very similar to that of dm outside the first caustic .",
    "since the accretion shock approximately separates the inner virialized region from the outer infalling flow , here we will consider a cluster to be the region inside the first caustic .",
    "so , below , we define the radius of the first caustic , @xmath45 , as the cluster radius , the mass inside @xmath45 , @xmath46 , as the total cluster mass , and the particle velocity just outside @xmath45 , @xmath47 , as the cluster accretion velocity .    our numerical set - up has been designed in a way parallel to that of bertschinger ( 1985 ) , so our numerical solution for the @xmath9 case should be identical to his self - similar solution .",
    "thus , the accuracy of our code has been tested against his solution .",
    "figure 1 shows the present phase - space distribution of particles in the einstein - de sitter universe , which can be directly compared with figure 6 of bertschinger ( 1985 ) .",
    "the variables used in the plot are related to those in the appendices as follows @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the present turnaround radius .",
    "our smoothing length in the gravitational force corresponds to @xmath51 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the plot shows that the numerical solution for @xmath52 agrees well with the exact analytic solution .",
    "the position of the first caustic agrees well with that of the analytic solution and the accretion velocity outside it agrees almost exactly . on the other hand , for @xmath53 the agreement in the two solutions",
    "is not so good .",
    "the numerical solution has given a smaller velocity than the analytic one and the positions of caustics have not been calculated correctly , as expected .",
    "however , the quantities we are interested in , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , are less affected by the smoothing . comparison of figure 1 with figure 6 of bertschinger ( 1985 ) shows that these quantities have been calculated accurately within an error typically less than @xmath54 or so .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the mass , radius , and accretion velocity of a cluster with the present mass of @xmath55 as a function of redshift in the einstein - de sitter universe , in the open universe with @xmath56 , and in the flat universe with @xmath56 .",
    "the dotted lines represent the power - law evolution of the analytic solution in the einstein - de sitter universe ( bertschinger 1985 ) ; @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the numerical solution in the einstein - de sitter universe follows the self - similar evolution very closely .",
    "again , good agreement of the numerical solution with the analytic solution indicates that our code has been able to calculate the quantities used in this paper reliably .",
    "but those in other model universes do not show the power - law evolution in @xmath60 , indicating the absence of the self - similarity .",
    "among the quantities we can extract from the x - ray observations of clusters , the icm temperature @xmath61 ( usually averaged over a core region ) is the one that can be estimated most reliably in hydrodynamic numerical simulations and that is less prone to numerical effects such as the problem of _ under - resolved structure_. that is because @xmath61 is a conserved quantity per unit mass ( the specific thermal energy ) .",
    "although clusters have formed only recently ( @xmath14 ) and the dynamical time of cluster evolution is about the hubble time , the structure of more - or - less relaxed clusters both in observations and simulations is well represented by the virialized region in hse with nearly constant temperature ( forman & jones 1982 ; evrard , metzler , & navarro 1995 ) .",
    "exceptions are the clusters that have recently undergone mergers . under the assumption of an _ isothermal sphere in hse _ , the average temperature is proportional to @xmath62 , or to the galaxy kinetic energy per unit mass , @xmath63 .",
    "so we use the ratio of the total cluster mass to radius , @xmath64 , as a quantity to represent the observed , average temperature ( emission weighted ) .",
    "as shown by three - dimensional simulations ( navarro , frenk , white 1995 ; evrard , metzler , navarro 1995 ) , simulated clusters of different masses have similar structures when they are scaled with a radius of a fixed density contrast ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "so the temperature follows the scaling law , @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the characteristic radius at a fixed density contrast . of course",
    ", the constant of proportionality for this scaling relation varies for different cosmologies .    here",
    ", we use the quantities , @xmath46 , @xmath45 , or @xmath64 , to denote clusters .",
    "note that @xmath45 corresponds to the characteristic radius of @xmath68 . under the set - up considered in this paper , only one of them is independent in a given cosmological model universe , because of the similarity in cluster structure . according to bertschinger ( 1985 ) , the self - similar solution at the present epoch in the einstein - de sitter universe gives @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the shock radius , and @xmath74 is the temperature at @xmath75 , which we may take as an average icm temperature of the self - similar flow .",
    "navarro , frenk , & white ( 1995 ) showed that the temperature profiles of simulated clusters normalized with the temperature at @xmath76 of @xmath77 can be represented within a factor of two by that of the self - similar solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) in @xmath78 . in the core region within @xmath79 ,",
    "the temperature is approximately isothermal .",
    "thus , @xmath74 should be a reasonable approximation to the average temperature of the cluster core region .    in figure 3",
    "we have plotted the present @xmath64 for clusters with the present mass @xmath55 ( upper panel ) and for clusters with the present radius @xmath80 ( lower panel ) in the open models and flat models with @xmath81 against the values of @xmath3 .",
    "those with @xmath19 correspond to the values in the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "here we have chosen @xmath82 as a fiducial value of the first caustic , since the typical radius of cluster core regions is often defined as @xmath83mpc and the abell radius is @xmath84mpc .",
    "according to the self - similar solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) given above , in the einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath85 for clusters with the given mass , while @xmath86 for clusters with the given radius .",
    "comparison between these values and our numerical results for @xmath19 case shows about @xmath87% error .",
    "since @xmath64 scales as @xmath88 for clusters with different masses and @xmath89 for clusters with different radii , the results can be scaled accordingly .",
    "the figure shows that the clusters , if they have the same mass or the same radius , are less tightly bound , and so have smaller @xmath64 in the universe with smaller @xmath3 .",
    "also , the clusters are less tightly bound in the flat universe with non - zero @xmath23 than in the open universe , if @xmath3 is the same .",
    "this is due to the fact the background expands faster in the flat universe with non - zero @xmath23 than in the open universe . in the open universe with @xmath90",
    ", @xmath64 is @xmath91 and @xmath92 smaller than that in the einstein - de sitter universe for clusters with given mass and radius , respectively . in the flat universe with @xmath90",
    ", @xmath64 is @xmath93 and @xmath94 smaller .",
    "this means that clusters are less massive and less bound so the icm temperature is lower in low density universes than in high density universes , if they are selected by a constant radius criterion .",
    "figure 4 shows the value of @xmath64 as a function of redshift in the einstein - de sitter universe , in the open universe with @xmath56 , and in the flat universe with @xmath56 .",
    "the upper panel is for clusters whose mass is @xmath95 at given @xmath96 .",
    "similarly , the lower panel is for clusters whose radius is @xmath97 at given @xmath96 .",
    "thus , each point in the plots represent different clusters that should become heavier than @xmath98 or bigger in radius than @xmath99 mpc at the present epoch .",
    "in other words , the redshift dependences in these plots do not represent the evolution of a particular cluster in a `` lagrangian '' sense .",
    "they tell us that clusters selected by either a constant mass or a constant radius criterion would be more tightly bound and so hotter in the past ( at higher redshifts ) than at the present epoch in all cosmologies .",
    "the dotted lines represent the power - law redshift dependences ( @xmath100 for clusters with a constant mass , and @xmath101 for clusters with a constant radius ) of the self - similar solution in the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "the numerical solution in the einstein - de sitter universe follows the self - similar solutions very well .",
    "once again we can see that clusters are less tightly bound in lower density universes .",
    "the increases of @xmath64 with increasing redshift in both lower density universes are slightly less than that in the einstein - de sitter universe .    in figure 5",
    "we have plotted the accretion velocity , @xmath47 , for clusters with the present mass @xmath55 ( the first panel ) , for clusters with the present radius @xmath80 ( the second panel ) , and for clusters with the present @xmath102 ( the third panel ) in the open and flat universes with different @xmath3 s .",
    "note that @xmath103 corresponds to @xmath104 in the einstein - de sitter universe ( see eq .",
    "6 ) ( corresponding @xmath74 should be slightly lower in the low density universes ) .",
    "clusters with different masses , radii , and @xmath64 s have the accretion velocity which scales as @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "smaller accretion velocity in the universes with smaller @xmath3 is consistent with the fact that the clusters are less tightly bound .",
    "the accretion velocity is slight smaller in the flat universe than in the open universe , if @xmath3 is same .",
    "the plot shows that the accretion velocity of clusters with a given mass or a given radius is smaller by up to @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively in the flat universe with @xmath90 than in the einstein - de sitter universe .    for clusters with the same @xmath64 , however , the difference between different cosmological models is rather small . in the open universe with @xmath90",
    "the accretion velocity is @xmath108 smaller than that in the einstein - de sitter universe , while in the flat universe with @xmath90 it is smaller by @xmath4 .",
    "this means we can expect that the clusters with the same observed temperature can have accretion velocities smaller only up to @xmath109 in low density universe depending on @xmath3 .",
    "figure 6 shows the accretion velocity for clusters with a mass of @xmath95 at given @xmath96 ( first panel ) , for clusters with a radius of @xmath97 at given @xmath96 ( second panel ) , and for clusters with @xmath110 at given @xmath96 ( third panel ) in the einstein - de sitter universe , in the open universe with @xmath56 , and in the flat universe with @xmath56 . as in fig .",
    "4 , they do not represent the evolutionary path of a cluster , but they show the dependence of @xmath47 on the redshift in a sample of clusters selected by a constant mass , or a constant radius , or a constant temperature criterion .",
    "the dotted lines represent the power - law dependence on the redshift of the self - similar solution in the einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath111 for clusters with a constant mass , @xmath112 for clusters with a constant radius , @xmath113 for clusters with a constant @xmath64 .",
    "the first two panels show that the accretion velocity of clusters with a constant mass or a constant radius was significantly larger in the past than now . on the other hand",
    ", the third panel shows that the accretion velocity of clusters with a constant @xmath64 remains constant with redshift in the einstein - de sitter universe due to the scale - free nature .",
    "but it was larger at high redshifts in the model universes with @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , in the open universe with @xmath56 the accretion velocity was larger by @xmath114 at high redshifts , while in the flat universe with @xmath56 it was larger by @xmath115 . at",
    "high redshifts ( @xmath116 ) the difference in @xmath47 among different cosmological models considered here reduces to only a few percents .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the properties of spherically accreting flows onto an initially overdense perturbation in different cosmological model universes including the einstein - de sitter universe with @xmath19 , the low - density open universe with @xmath0 , and the low - density , flat universe with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . according to the semi - analytic treatment of the self - similar solution for the einstein - de sitter universe by bertschinger ( 1985 ) , the accretion shock of bm with @xmath24 forms very close to the first caustic of dm , and the flow upstream to the accretion shock and the first caustic is identical regardless of whether it is collisional or collisionless .",
    "thus , we have assumed that the position of the accretion shock can be approximated by that of the first caustic and the accretion velocity of bm outside the accretion shock by that of dm outside the first caustic .",
    "since self - similar solutions do not exist for @xmath117 universes , we have used a one - dimensional , spherical , @xmath13-body code to study the properties of accreting matter .",
    "the accretion velocity onto a cluster with a given initial perturbation has decreased as the universe expands in all cosmological models . in the einstein - de sitter universe",
    "it has followed @xmath118 ( bertschinger 1985 ) , while in low density universes it decreases faster with time , especially at low redshifts ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this is related to the smaller deceleration of the expanding background .",
    "the properties of accretion flows around the clusters of the same characteristic ( mass , radius , or temperature ) will depend on the cosmological parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath23 , since the accretion rate is affected by the expansion rate of the background universe .",
    "the accretion velocity is smaller in a lower density universe and even smaller in a non - zero @xmath23 universe . for clusters of a given mass at given redshift ,",
    "the present accretion velocity in the low density universe with @xmath119 is smaller by up to @xmath5 than that in the einstein - de sitter universe . for clusters of a given radius at given redshift ,",
    "the present accretion velocity in the low density universe with @xmath119 is smaller by up to @xmath6 than that in the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "hence , if the accretion velocity of infalling matter around clusters can be measured along with their mass and radius , then it could be used to discriminate the different cosmological models .    however , for clusters of a given temperature or given @xmath64 , the present value of the accretion velocity as well as its evolution depend on the cosmological model rather weakly . according to the self - similar solution of bertschinger ( 1985 ) , in the einstein - de sitter universe , for clusters of a given temperature ,",
    "the accretion velocity at present is given as @xmath120 , and it has been constant through the evolution of the universe . in the universes with smaller @xmath3 , the present accretion velocity is smaller by up to @xmath121 in the models considered here with @xmath122 .",
    "but this difference decreases to a few percents at high redshifts ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "thus , it would be difficult to use the accretion velocity of clusters with a given temperature to discriminate among the cosmological models .",
    "however , this has an important implication for the model of the origin of ultra high energy cosmic rays that the acceleration of protons in accretion shocks around clusters can contribute significantly to the observed particle flux above @xmath123ev ( kang , ryu , & jones 1996 ; kang , rachen & biermann 1996 ) .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the matter accretion and the accretion shock around clusters are universal for all cosmological models , although the accretion regime is less strong in lower density universes .",
    "the shock velocity @xmath124 for the rich clusters of @xmath125 kev , for example , is estimated to be @xmath126 in the einstein - de sitter universe , which is enough for the model to work .",
    "the results in this paper imply that the model might be extended to all cosmologically viable universes of low density , since the reduction in the shock velocity is no more than @xmath121 .",
    "the region of clusters observed by either optical or x - ray observations ( @xmath127mpc ) is inside the first caustic or the accretion shock ( @xmath128 mpc for @xmath129 kev ) . although the existence of hot gas heated by the accretion shocks has been shown clearly in most cosmological simulations including hydrodynamics for any variants of cosmological models ( kang 1994 ; cen & ostriker 1994 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ) , any direct observations of gas near the shock would not be possible at present due to low surface brightness .",
    "but it has been suggested that the unbound hot gas of @xmath130 k around clusters and groups heated by the large scale accretion shocks is a major component of the igm which emits mostly at soft x - ray below @xmath131 kev ( ostriker & cen 1996 ) .",
    "this prediction might be tested by looking for the spatial correlation between the soft x - ray cosmic background radiation and the observed large scale structure .",
    "on the other hand , the infalling clouds of unshocked , warm gas may be identified through the absorption lines of quasars which are located inside clusters of galaxies .",
    "this warm low density gas of @xmath7k is photoionized by the diffuse radiation from the hot postshock gas and the diffuse cosmic background radiation . in some studies ( , weymann 1979 ;",
    "foltz 1986 ) , the c iv absorption systems of quasar emission lines with @xmath132 are interpreted as clouds associated with rich clusters where the quasars reside .",
    "the characteristics of these systems of c iv absorbers are different from those of the typical intervening c iv absorbers .",
    "it was noted that the velocity difference is somewhat too large compared to the typical velocity dispersion of galaxies ( @xmath133 ) in rich clusters ( foltz 1986 ) . the accretion velocity , however , is a bit larger than the galaxy velocity dispersions , since it is given by @xmath134 in the einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "thus it is possible that these absorption systems are in fact the infalling clumps of gas upstream of the accretion shock .    in follow - up papers we will study the properties and statistics of three - dimensional accretion flows in simulated universes by analyzing the data from three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of various cosmological models ( , kang 1994 ; cen & ostriker 1994 ) .",
    "these simulations have been performed by a high - resolution , grid - based , eulerian code ( ryu 1993 ) which resolves the shock discontinuity in 2 - 3 cells and is designed specifically to handle the flows with supersonic bulk motions .",
    "thus , the low density regions around caustics and shocks are well represented in these simulations , even though the high density core region of clusters might be under - resolved ( kang 1994 ) .",
    "the present one - dimensional study will provide some useful guidance for such studies .",
    "the authors thank dr .",
