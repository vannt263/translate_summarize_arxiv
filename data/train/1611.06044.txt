    "during their post - main - sequence evolution massive stars pass through several short - lived phases of enhanced mass loss .",
    "yellow hypergiants ( yhgs ) and b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sgs ) are well - known groups in such transition phases .",
    "the ejected material typically accumulates in either shells , rings , or disk - like structures .",
    "rich emission line spectra of such objects provide information on the structure and kinematics of the circumstellar matter .",
    "forbidden emission lines of singly ionized or neutral metals , such as [ caii ] and [ oi ] , serve as particularly valuable tracers for their formation regions , carrying information on kinematics and physical conditions .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the appearance of these lines requires high - density environments combined with large emitting volumes .",
    "such conditions are met in the innermost regions of keplerian rotating disks around b[e]sgs , where [ caii ] lines are formed closest to the star , followed by the [ oi ] @xmath05577 line and the [ oi ] @xmath16300 , 6364 lines further out .",
    "yhgs are massive stars that have passed through the red - supergiant ( rsg ) phase and evolve back bluewards in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "enhanced mass loss and eruptions in yhgs are ascribed to increased pulsation activity .",
    "although physical mechanisms causing build - up of massive disks around b[e]sgs are unknown , it has been suggested that pulsations might play a role as well .",
    "controversial results have been obtained concerning the evolutionary state of b[e]sgs .",
    "while the enrichment in @xmath2c in their disks favors a pre - rsg state , their massive dusty environments indicate a post - rsg evolutionary phase .",
    "similarities in the circumstellar environments of yhgs and b[e]sgs support the latter case and the suggestion by @xcite that yhgs may be evolving toward the b[e]sg phase .",
    "during the years 20102015 , we carried out an optical spectroscopic survey of a large sample of galactic northern emission - line stars .",
    "the survey includes four yhgs : v1302aql ( a2-f8ia ) , v509cas ( a7-g5ia ) , @xmath3cas ( f0-g7ia ) , v1427aql ( f3-g5ia ) , and two b[e]sgs : v1478cyg ( b0-b1.5i ) and 3pup ( a2.7ib ) .",
    "the b[e]sgs were discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "spectra were obtained using the coud spectrograph attached to the perek 2-m telescope at ondejov observatory @xcite in three wavelength regions : around h  @xmath4 ( 62506760 , @xmath5 13000 ) , in the region of the [ caii ] @xmath17291 ,  7324 lines ( 69907500 , @xmath5 15000 ) , and in the region of the caii infrared triplet ( 84708980 , @xmath5 18000 ) .",
    "the h  @xmath4 region also encloses the two [ oi ] @xmath16300 , 6364 lines .",
    "both the [ caii ] and [ oi ] lines were identified in the spectra of the b[e]sgs v1478cyg and 3pup , and of the hotter yhgs v1302aql and v509cas ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , while in the cooler yhgs @xmath3cas and v1427aql only the [ caii ] lines were present , but not the [ oi ] lines .",
    "also the infrared caii triplet lines are in emission in b[e]sgs and the hotter yhgs , while in the cooler yhgs we see them in absorption .",
    "this indicates a difference in excitation mechanisms of the [ caii ] lines in hotter and cooler environments .",
    "both b[e]sgs are known to possess a disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we obtained rotational velocities from the line profiles of these b[e]sgs using a simple kinematic model , assuming that the emission originates from a narrow keplerian rotating ring .",
    "we calculated the profile shape considering only the rotational velocity projected to the line of sight and the resolution of the spectrograph ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the presence of both sets of forbidden lines in the two hot yhgs indicates that the physical conditions in their environments could be similar to those in the b[e]sgs .",
    "the profiles of the forbidden emission lines of v1302aql are single peaked ( fig.[fig1 ] ) and display no kinematical broadening beyond spectral resolution .",
    "such profiles are in agreement with their formation in the nearly pole - on seen disk .",
    "not much is currently known concerning the structure of the small - scale environment of v509cas .",
    "the forbidden lines in our spectra show clearly double - peaked profiles for the [ caii ] lines .",
    "the [ oi ] lines appear as broad but single peaked features at our spectral resolution , however , modeling of the profile reveals significant rotational broadening of the lines , as for v1478cyg ( fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this kinematical picture is typical for b[e]sgs .",
    "thus , v509cas is the second yhg with clear indication for an inner disk .    in both cooler",
    "yhgs the profiles of the [ caii ] lines are very narrow single - peaked .",
    "they provide no information on the kinematics in their [ caii ] line - forming regions , but are consistent with an origin from a spherically symmetric shell .",
    "the presence of disks around the hotter yhgs might indicate a drastic change in the mass - loss behavior from spherical to axisymmetric during the evolution through the yellow void , as was suggested by @xcite .",
    "as pulsations are believed to be the main mechanism responsible for enhanced mass loss and eruptions in yhgs , this would require a change in the pulsation habit of the stars when they approach the blue boundary of the `` first '' instability region ( fig.[fig3 ] ) . during their passage through the second part of the yellow void , more material",
    "might still accumulate in the equatorial plane and at the blue edge of the yellow void the stars might appear as b[e]sgs .",
    "such a scenario was already suggested for v1302aql by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it might also apply to v509cas and even to a larger sample of hot yhgs , which is worth being investigated in more detail ."
