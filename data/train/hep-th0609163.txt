    "string theory is a useful tool to study dynamics of gauge theories .",
    "an advantage of using string theory for the analysis of gauge theories is that we can translate quantum corrections and non - perturbative effects in gauge theories to classical phenomena associated with geometries of spacetime and brane configurations .    among many kinds of dualities",
    ", the duality between conifolds and @xmath5 superconformal gauge theories attracts a great deal of attention .",
    "the first non - trivial example of this duality was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is the duality between the conifold over @xmath6 and a certain @xmath7 superconformal gauge theory at the ir fixed point .",
    "this duality has been generalized to more complicated ones .",
    "the recent discovery of the explicit metrics of classes of sasaki - einstein manifolds@xcite provides us many examples of dualities we can explicitly check the validity . for example",
    ", it has been confirmed that the volumes of the sasaki - einstein manifolds and some supersymmetric cycles in them correctly reproduce the central charges and conformal dimensions of baryonic operators in superconformal gauge theories , which can be determined on the field theory side with the help of the @xmath8-maximization technique@xcite .",
    "there are also many attempts to generalize the correspondence to non - conformal cases .",
    "one way to break the conformal symmetry on the field theory side is to change the ranks of the @xmath9 gauge groups .",
    "this is realized by the introduction of fractional d3-branes on the gravity side .",
    "the coupling running@xcite and the duality cascade@xcite caused by the introduction of the fractional branes are studied by using dual gravity solutions .",
    "the brane tilings@xcite , proposed by hanany et al .",
    "are different , but closely related way to realize @xmath5 quiver gauge theories with fivebranes in type iib theory .",
    "the brane configurations are conveniently described with tilings on tori .",
    "each face is identified with a stack of @xmath10 d5-branes , and an @xmath9 gauge group lives on it .",
    "an edge shared by two faces represents the intersection of the d5-branes and ns5-branes , and corresponds to a chiral multiplet belonging to a bi - fundamental representation of the two gauge groups associated with the two faces .",
    "thus , the tilings can be regarded as dual graphs of quiver diagrams drawn on tori , which are often called periodic quiver diagrams .",
    "an advantage of the brane tilings ( and the periodic quiver diagrams ) to the ordinary quiver diagrams is that we can easily read off the superpotential from the diagram .",
    "there are many rules proposed to read off the properties and phenomena in gauge theories from the diagrams .",
    "for example , we can easily obtain anomaly free charge assignments of global symmetries from the brane tilings@xcite .",
    "we can also determine ir behavior of non - conformal gauge theories depending on the rank distributions@xcite .",
    "it is important to obtain these relations between the graphical information in the tilings and the properties of gauge theories directly by using action or equations of motion of branes and supergravity . in this paper , we particularly discuss how anomalies in gauge theories show up in the brane tilings .",
    "anomalies arise as one - loop corrections in gauge theories , and have topological nature in the sense that their coefficients are quantized , and are invariant under continuous variation of parameters .",
    "this makes analysis on the string side tractable .",
    "in general it is difficult to determine the precise shape of branes in a brane system . by the reason we mention above , for the analysis of anomalies",
    ", we do not need the precise shape of the branes .",
    "we only need the topological structure and the asymptotic shape of branes . in @xcite , the relation between cancellations of gauge ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 anomalies and flux conservations on the brane system",
    "is discussed , and it is shown that if the boundary conditions imposed on the fields on branes at fivebrane junctions are satisfied , the anomaly cancellations are automatically realized . in this paper , we discuss so - called t  hooft anomalies which are in general not canceled .",
    "we show that some of the anomalies can be reproduced as the variations of the classical brane action by gauge transformations .",
    "( in this paper we are not very careful about signs . )",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    " [ config.sec ] , we briefly explain the relation between the tiling diagrams and the structure of the branes in the system . in  [ global.sec ] , we identify global @xmath13 symmetries in gauge theories with gauge symmetries in the brane system . using this identification",

    "the @xmath14 anomalies are known to vanish , and we use this fact to fix the ambiguity of the regularization . we show that the other two kinds of anomalies are reproduced as variations of the classical brane action .",

    "because @xmath320 has endpoint at origin in the 4689 space , we have @xmath332 for the consistency , the exterior derivative of the right hand side in ( [ eom2 ] ) must vanish because the left hand side is closed . from this condition , we obtain @xmath333 and @xmath325 is determined as @xmath334 ( this can be defined only when @xmath335 . if @xmath336 , @xmath287 is conserved by itself and we can set @xmath337 . )",

    "we obtain @xmath368 this precisely cancels the @xmath297 dependent term ( [ c1dep ] ) .",
    "in this paper we studied the brane realization of global symmetries and t  hooft anomalies associated with them .",
    "we showed that @xmath17 symmetries can be realized as linear combinations of the @xmath13 gauge symmetries on the fivebranes , while the @xmath18 symmetries are combinations of gauge symmetry of the ns - ns @xmath41-form field in the bulk and the @xmath13 gauge symmetries on the ns5-branes .",
    "the mixing ambiguity for @xmath18 can be interpreted as the gauge ambiguity associated with the @xmath178-field gauge transformation .",
    "we identified @xmath19 symmetry with the rotation of the system on the @xmath369-@xmath370 plane . with this identification",
    ", it seems that there is a preferred @xmath371-charge assignment of the bi - fundamental fields .",
    "namely , the angles among external legs seems to determine the r - charges uniquely .",
    "it is not clear how we should interpret this specific @xmath19 symmetries on the gauge theory side .",
    "one possibility is that it may be related to the @xmath19 symmetry in the superconformal algebra .",
    "we can not , however , simply identify these two .",
    "one reason is as follows .",
    "the charges for superconformal @xmath19 is determined with the help of so - called @xmath8-maximization procedure , and the charges obtained by this procedure are always quadratic rational numbers .",
    "namely , they are represented as @xmath372 with rationals @xmath8 and @xmath50 and an integer @xmath344 . on the other hand , in   [ rsym.sec ] , r - charges are given as angles among external legs in web diagrams .",
    "it is unlikely that these two sets of quantities , a set of quadratic rationals and a set of angles , coincide .",
    "another reason is that the angles among the external legs depend on the modulus of the torus along 57 directions , while the @xmath8-maximizing r - charge assignment does not seem to have such a degree of freedom",
    ". we may be able to understand the disagreement between the two sets of r - charges as follows . in this paper",
    "we only used the asymptotic shape of the branes to determine the charges .",
    "this seems to give only the information of ultra - violet region . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath8-maximizing symmetry is in general realized only in the infra - red limit .",
    "thus , it is natural that the two sets of charges are different . in order to investigate low - energy dynamics of gauge theories , including the charges of operators for the superconformal r - symmetry",
    ", it would be important to know the precise shape of the brane in the central region of the brane configuration .    in ",
    "[ anomaly.sec ] , we showed that two kinds of non - vanishing t  hooft anomalies , @xmath15 and @xmath16 anomalies , are obtained as the variations of the classical action of the branes .",
    "natural question arises here is that how we can get other anomalies . especially , @xmath373 and @xmath19 , which are used in the @xmath8-maximization , are very important if we discuss low - energy dynamics of gauge theories . because r - symmetry is identified with the spacial rotation of the brane system , the corresponding gauge field enters in the metric and the spin connection .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain @xmath373 and @xmath19 anomalies , we need to consider the brane configuration in curved backgrounds , and take account of the higher derivative terms including the curvature of the background spacetime .",
    "this ( and the problem about r - charges we mentioned above ) makes the analysis more difficult than what we have done in this paper .",
