    "the question whether or not the original lorenz system for such parameter values has the same structure as the geometric lorenz model has been unsolved for more than 30 years . by combination of normal form theory and rigorous computations",
    ", tucker @xcite answered this question affirmatively , that is , for classical parameters , the original lorenz system has a robust strange attractor which is given by the same rules as for the geometric lorenz model . from these facts , we know that the geometric lorenz model is crucial in the study of lorenz dynamical systems .",
