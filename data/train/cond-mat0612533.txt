    "<S> we show that in moderately disordered half metals the supercurrent is carried predominantly by odd - frequency @xmath1-wave and @xmath15-wave amplitudes , multiplied with even frequency @xmath2-wave and @xmath16-wave amplitudes . in the diffusive limit the supercurrent is dominated by the product of the @xmath1-wave and the @xmath2-wave amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a peak in the temperature dependence of the critical current , previously predicted for clean half metals @xcite , is a robust feature also for disordered half metals .    </S>",

    "<S> the sum of the singlet and triplet currents is constant , obeying the continuity equation .    </S>",

    "<S> spin - mixing is the result of different scattering phase shifts that electrons with opposite spin acquire when scattered ( reflected or transmitted ) from an interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it results from either a spin - polarization of the interface potential , or differences in the wavevector mismatches for spin up and spin down particles at either side of the interface , or both . </S>",
    "<S> it is a robust and ubiquitous feature for interfaces involving strongly spin - polarized ferromagnets .    </S>",
    "<S> broken spin - rotation symmetry leads to spin - flip processes at the interfaces . </S>",

    "<S> the local moments are expected to show a certain degree of disorder for two reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , the coordination number is lowered by the broken translation symmetry at the interface which leads to enhanced fluctuations in the direction of the local moments from that in the ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , structural disorder leads to vacancies in the lattice of moments . </S>",
    "<S> the exact microscopic distribution of local moments at the interface is not important for superconducting phenomena , since cooper pairs are of the size of the coherence length @xmath20 which is much larger than the atomic scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , important for the effective interface scattering matrix , as it can lead to spin - flip terms if the directional distribution of the local moments breaks the spin - rotation symmetry around @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the presence of two easy axes with relative angle @xmath21 leads to a non - trivial distribution of the moments at the interface , where a majority of the moments are pointing along the magnetization axis of the bulk half metal but with a significant number of moments misaligned but preferably along the second easy axes . </S>",
