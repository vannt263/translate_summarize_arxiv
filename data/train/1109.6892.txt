    "the evidence of star - planet interaction ( spi ) in the x - ray band is a lively matter of debate . to first order , close - in giant planets ( also known as `` hot jupiters '' )",
    "should affect their host stars through both tidal and magneto - hydrodynamical effects ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "both effects should scale as the @xmath0 power distance between the bodies ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that stars with hot jupiters are statistically brighter in x - rays than stars without hot jupiters . on average",
    "@xcite observed an excess of x - ray emission by a factor of 4 in the hot jupiter sample .",
    "interplay between the magnetic fields of the hot jupiter and the star may be the source of this difference .",
    "this could be due to interacting winds and magnetic fields or indirectly by enhancing the stellar dynamo .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite ( and @xcite ) have found no statistical evidence of x - ray spi as claimed by @xcite .",
    "the system of hd  189733  offers a unique environment to study spi effects in x - rays and disentangle them from proper coronal activity .",
    "it is composed of a k1.5v type star ( at only 19.3 pc from sun ) , and a m4 companion at 3200 au from the primary , orbiting on a plane perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "it hosts a hot jupiter class planet ( hd  189733 b ) at a distance of only 0.031 au with a orbital period of @xmath1d @xcite .    in 2009",
    "we observed the eclipse of the planetary companion to hd  189733 with the goal of studying star planet interactions ( spi ) in the case of a hot jupiter ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "we observed a _ softening _ of the spectrum in strict correspondence of the planetary eclipse , and a flare which occurred 3  ks after the end of the eclipse of the planet .",
    "the non - detection of the m type companion is a strong constraint on the age of the system at @xmath2 gyr .",
    "the high age of the secondary is interesting because it is inconsistent with age of the system as derived from stellar activity which is of order 600 myr @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite reported on chandra observations of an planetary transit of corot 2a finding a similar case . while they do not detect the transit in x - rays they find that the primary is x - ray bright with a luminosity @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 , indicating an age @xmath5 300 myr .",
    "meanwhile , a potential stellar companion was undetected down to a limit of @xmath6 ergs s@xmath4 which is inconsistent with the 300 myr age and the distance of 270 pc .",
    "the beginning of the flare observed in 2009 in hd  189733 is at phase @xmath7 , which coincides with a location 77@xmath8 forward of the sub - planetary point and emerging to the day side of the star .",
    "this is almost exactly the location of the magnetic sub - planetary point as calculated by @xcite .",
    "the flare could be associated with the emergence of the foot - point of the magnetic column to the earth facing side or a complex active region induced by magnetic spi .",
    "overall , the flare is associated with a change of the mean plasma temperature from @xmath9 kev to @xmath10 kev .",
    "the triplet is in excess with respect to the best fit model . in the rgs spectra",
    "we observed that during the flare the inter - combination line seems to disappear , and the forbidden line is less luminous .    in this letter",
    "we report on the follow up observation obtained in april 2011 at the same phase as in 2009 , during an eclipse of the planet .",
    "sections [ observation ] and [ results0 ] describe the observation and the results .",
    "[ conclusions ] reports our conclusions .",
    "the observational setup mimics our previous observation made on may 18th 2009 .",
    "we obtained a x - ray observation with _ xmm - newton _ around the eclipse of the planet of hd  189733 on april 30th 2011 , starting at 23:14.20 ( obs",
    "i d : 0672390201 ) , and for a total duration of @xmath1139.1 ks . as in the previous observation",
    ", we used the _ medium _ filter .",
    "the time between observations of hd  189733 was almost 2 years or exactly 61530.1 ks ( mid - eclipse to mid - eclipse ) .",
    "the period of the star is 11.953@xmath120.009 days @xcite , hence the star had rotated through 59.5795@xmath120.045 periods , while the planet had orbited it 321 times .    for the reduction of the data we followed the same procedure as in paper i , by using sas ver .",
    "11.0 to extract events , light curves and spectra of hd  189733   recorded with epic camera and rgs . for fitting the spectra",
    ", we used 2-t vapec models for the pre - flare phases ( see description of light curve in sect .",
    "[ results ] ) with different temperatures but coupled to have the same abundances .",
    "abundances of fe , ne , and o were left free to vary while all other abundances were kept fixed at the solar values . for flare and post - flare phases",
    "we added a third vapec component keeping frozen the parameters of the first two vapec components .",
    "the abundances of the third component were linked and fixed .",
    "we obtained estimates of the temperature and emission measure of the flaring plasma , also following its fading after the flare .",
    "we applied the same procedure of best fit to the spectra obtained in 2007 ( for the whole observation ) , and 2009 ( split in pre - flare , flare and post - flare phases ) in order to compare the results .",
    "we merged the rgs spectra in the non - flare and in the flare state of all observations .",
    "flare and non - flare state were fitted independently using gaussian lines with a narrow intrinsic line width in the sherpa fitting tool @xcite , so that the total line width is dominated by instrumental broadening .",
    "lines are adjusted in wavelength to account for possible errors in the zero - point of the wavelength calibration , but the wavelength difference in multiplets is hold constant . within the errors ,",
    "all wavelength are compatible with the theoretical values .",
    "instrumental background and source continuum are assumed to be constant over a small wavelength region around the fitted lines .",
    "the fits are done using a cash statistic , which takes into account the poisson distribution of counts , but the estimates of errors might be uncertain for very low count numbers .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in the flares , the emission increases by about a factor of three in agreement with the increased temperature seen in the light curve of median energy and spectra of pn . the total emission of the he - like triplets is similar in flare and non - flare intervals .",
    "the ratio of lines from different ionization stages can be used as a temperature diagnostic @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : o82o7 ] shows the ratio of / emission compared to the total luminosity in these lines .",
    "blues squares show main - sequence ( ms ) stars from the sample of , red triangles are classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) , which are accreting pre - main sequence stars @xcite .",
    "ctts show an excess of cool emission , which is likely powered by accretion shocks .",
    "hd  189733 is among the stars in the sample with the lowest x - ray luminosity and / ratio .",
    "thus , it is marginally cooler than ms stars of comparable luminosity , but its corona is over - dense like pms accreting stars .",
    "all ctts in fig .",
    "[ fig : o82o7 ] are significantly brighter than hd  189773 , but this is a selection bias because only the brightest ctts can be observed with x - ray gratings .     ]      the ratio of the forbidden line @xmath13 and the inter - combination line @xmath14 in the he - like triplets is density sensitive . in the low - density , limit",
    "@xmath15 is 3.5 for ( @xmath16 ) and 3.2 for ( @xmath17 ) according to the chianti database .",
    "we performed monte - carlo simulations to account for the non - gaussian errors in the distribution ( * ? ? ? * appendix a ) .",
    "the lines are compatible with the low to moderate density limit in the non - flare state ( 95% confidence limit @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath19 ) , in the flare spectrum the error is too large to constrain the density .",
    "the non - detection of the @xmath14 line in the flare is consistent with moderate densities , the 95% confidence lower limit is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) . in the non - flare state ,",
    "the 95% confidence upper and lower boundaries on the @xmath15 ratio are 1.8 ( @xmath22 ) and 0.6 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "generally , the coronal emission in ms stars is in the low - density limit , only in a few bright flares higher densities have been seen .",
    "the total luminosity in the he - like triplets changes little between the flare and the non - flare state .",
    "this could indicate that they originate in a dense region which is not affected by flare heating .",
    "however , the tentative change in the @xmath15 ratio can be interpreted as a change in density , where the hotter plasma seen in the flare state has a lower density than in the non - flare state .",
    "we have analyzed a _ xmm - newton _ observation of hd  189733  at the secondary transit of the planet .",
    "we observed a flare with characteristics very similar to that observed in the previous observation at the same phase .",
    "the recurrence of such flares is explained by the following scenario : an active region is present at the same location on the stellar surface in both observations .",
    "the magnetic interaction with the planet is inducing a flaring activity in this region .",
    "the occurrence depends on the configuration of the stellar magnetic field and its strength .",
    "further observations at the same phase can prove or reject this hypothesis .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy in quiescent and flaring state shows that the corona of hd  189733 is marginally cooler than ms stars with same oxygen line luminosity .",
    "we find a marginal change in @xmath15 ratio of lines in the flare state , implying a lower density during flares with respect to quiescent state . in summary",
    ", the corona of hd  189733 stands apart with respect to other coronae of main sequence stars without hot jupiters .",
    "it is cold like the solar corona but it is dense and ten times more luminous and active .",
    "this could be related to spi effects but more observations are needed to clarify the influence of its hot jupiter on the corona .",
