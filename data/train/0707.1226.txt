    "among the well known mechanisms of @xmath0 dissociation  @xcite-@xcite the one due to gluonic bombardment deserves special attention here .",
    "recently the present authors  @xcite considered the statistical mechanics of important physical observables _ viz . _ the gluon number density , thermally - averaged @xmath6 break - up rate , and the @xmath3 meson survival probability appropriate to rhic / lhc initial conditions .",
    "it is a well - recognized fact that the longitudinal / transverse expansion of the medium controls the master rate equations  @xcite for the time - evolution of the plasma temperature and parton fugacities .",
    "but the literature _ does not _ tell how the fluid velocity profile itself influences the lorentz transformations connecting the rest frames of the fireball , plasma , and @xmath3 meson .",
    "in other words , since the _ flow velocity profile _ causes inhomogeneities in space - time , hence the scenario of @xmath0 gluonic break - up may be affected in a quite nontrivial manner and the aim of the present paper is to address this hitherto unsolved problem .",
    "if @xmath7 is the the gluon @xmath8-momentum in the fireball rest frame and @xmath9 , the gluon @xmath8-momentum in the local comoving frame of the plasma is then given by lorentz transformations ku = k^0  ;   k^0/k^0 = ( 1 + ) , where @xmath10 is the fluid @xmath8 velocity . then the gluon number density using the bose - einstein distribution can be expressed as n_g(x ) = t^3 _ n=1^ this result shows in a compact manner how the number density depends upon @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "next , we turn to the question of applying statistical mechanics to gluonic break - up of the @xmath0 moving inside an expanding parton plasma . in the fireball frame",
    "consider a @xmath3 meson of mass @xmath14 , four momentum @xmath15 , three velocity @xmath16 and dilation factor @xmath17 .",
    "the invariant quantum mechanical dissociation rate @xmath18 for @xmath6 collision may be written as = v__rel where @xmath19 is the relative flux and @xmath20 the cross section measured in any chosen frame .",
    "its thermal average over gluon momentum in the _ fireball _ frame reads ( x ) =   f let @xmath21 be the gluon @xmath8 momentum measured in @xmath3 meson _ rest _ frame . since the relative flux becomes @xmath22 hence our invariant @xmath18 reduces to the qcd  @xcite based cross section = _ _ rest = b ( q^0 - 1)^3/2/q^0 ^ 5  ;   q^0 _ + q^0 = 1  ;   b=^2 where @xmath23 is the @xmath0 binding energy and @xmath24 the charmed quark mass .",
    "the energy variable for the massless gluon transforms _ via _ k^0 = _ ( q^0 + _  ) = _ q^0 ( 1 + |_| _ q ) with @xmath25 being the angle between @xmath26 and @xmath27 unit vectors .",
    "furthermore , the fluid @xmath8- velocity @xmath28 seen in @xmath3 rest frame will be given by the lorentz transformations w^0 & = & _ ( 1 - _ ) + & = & , and the scalar product ku = q w = q^0 w^0 - q^0 || _ qw where @xmath29 is the angle between @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the thermally - averaged rate of ( 4 ) can be calculated as  @xcite ( x ) = _ n=1^_g^n _ 1^dq^0 q^0 ^ 2 _ rest ( q^0 ) e^-c_n q^0 + where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "this demonstrate how the mean dissociation rate @xmath33 depends on the _ hydrodynamic _ flow through @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) as well as the angle @xmath36 .",
    "+ from the analytical viewpoint it is much more advisable to work with the modified rate ( x ) & & n_g(x ) ( x ) + & &  _ g _",
    "1^dq^0 q^0 ^ 2 _ _ rest",
    "h + & & _ g _ h here the _",
    "dependence on the flow velocity @xmath37 is contained in the function h e^-c_1 q^0_p  , d_1 we are now ready to discuss some consequences of ( 10 ) in _ three _ cases _ viz . _ static medium in the fireball frame , no flow in the @xmath0 rest frame , and ultrarelativistic flow in either frame",
    ". + first , we consider static medium in fireball frame where @xmath38 .",
    "this is precisely the case treated in our earlier paper  @xcite . due to the assumed absence of flow",
    "there is no inhomogeneity with respect to @xmath39 .     as a function of temperature ( transverse momenta ) at different transverse momenta ( temperature ) in the absence of flow .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    at fixed @xmath40 the steady _ increase _ of @xmath41 with @xmath12 in fig.1 is caused by the growing @xmath42 factors of the estimate(11 ) whereas at fixed @xmath12 the monotonic _ decrease _ of @xmath2 with @xmath40 in fig.1 has a very interesting explanation . for the case under study",
    "@xmath43 is antiparallel to @xmath16 so that @xmath44 .",
    "hence partial wave terms @xmath45 and @xmath46 of @xmath47 _ interfere _ destructively in fig .",
    "4 making @xmath2 small as @xmath48 grows .",
    "+ secondly , we consider no flow in @xmath0 rest frame where @xmath49 velocities of the plasma and @xmath3 meson coincide at some @xmath39 in the fireball frame , i.e . , @xmath50 .",
    "here the values are consistently higher than the above no - flow case .",
    "+ thirdly , we illustrate the case of both the @xmath0 and plasma moving ultrarelativistically ( in the tranverse and longitudinal directions , respectively ) with @xmath51 .",
    "the rough estimate ( 10 ) becomes ( x ) ( - )     using eqs.(9,10 ) as a function of temperature ( transverse momenta ) at different transverse momenta ( temperature ) for the ultrarelativistic longitudinal flow velocity @xmath52 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    at fixed @xmath40 , @xmath53 the exponential in ( 11 ) tend to @xmath54 as @xmath55 and tends to @xmath56 as @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the growing trend of @xmath58 with @xmath12 in fig.2 is understandable whereas at fixed @xmath12 , @xmath53 the rich behaviour of @xmath58 with @xmath40 in fig.2 arises from a sensitive competition between the bracketed factors of ( 11 ) .",
    "in fact , at lower temperatures @xmath59 gev the exponential factor increases dominantly with @xmath40 causing @xmath58 to grow , but at higher temperatures @xmath60 gev the third bracket in ( 12 ) decreases prominantly with @xmath40 causing @xmath2 to drop . in the case of pure transverse expansion of the plasma @xmath61",
    "can even become @xmath62 , implying constructive interference between @xmath45 and @xmath46 in ( 11 )  @xcite .",
    "suppose at general instant @xmath63 in the fireball frame the plasma is contained inside a _ cylinder _ of radius @xmath64 , and expanding longitudinally with a velocity = z_z / t  ;   -l/2 z + l/2 .",
    "then the effective survival chance of a chosen @xmath3 meson will be given by the exponential @xmath65 with w = _",

    "the time dependence of gluon - number density have been provided by the solution of the master - rate equation of a chemically evolving plasma  @xcite .",
