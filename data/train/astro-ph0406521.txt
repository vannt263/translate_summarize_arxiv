    "neutrino - driven convection , which is inherently a nonspherical phenomenon , excites large - scale convective motions that stochastically jostle the protoneutron star ( burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ; janka & mller 1994 ) .",

    "these analyses suggest the need for additional asymmetries before the onset of collapse . & hayes ( 1996 ) state that global asymmetries in the progenitor may be prerequisites for large kicks . in a 2-d hydrodynamic simulation and with modest asymmetries , & hayes ( 1996 ) are able to produce a recoil speed of @xmath2550 km s@xmath3",

    "thus , an indentification of important trends in the models is helpful in characterizing these modes . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoandye ] we see that more massive models have higher entropy , translating into lower central densities and more extended density ( @xmath19 ) versus interior mass , @xmath36 , profiles .",
    "consequently , prominent boundaries which are associated with discontinuities in entropy and @xmath83 and which affect the character of the modes are also located at larger radii for higher - mass progenitors .",
    "these discontinuities are the boundary between the fossil fe core ( the residue of core si burning ) and the most recent fe ashes from shell si burning ( circles on fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoandye ] ) , the edge of the fe core ( includes the fossil fe core and recent fe ashes ) and the si burning shell ( stars on fig .",

    "1989 ) . a propagation diagram , which plots @xmath90 and @xmath91 versus @xmath36 or @xmath37 , shows where in the star each type of wave is allowed to propagate .",
    "the propagation diagrams for the 13 m@xmath1 ( top panel ) and 30 m@xmath1 ( bottom panel ) models and their corresponding density and @xmath83 profiles , are presented in fig .",

    "the equivalent period has been presented for each .",
    "these periods are @xmath92 and @xmath93 . an important feature illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2andstruct ] is that @xmath90 rises and then falls , creating a resonant cavity for g - modes .",
    "the fall is partly due to the density and pressure structures , but on the outside it dramatically plummets due to convection in the o - burning shell , thereby confining g - waves within the core . for higher frequencies ( lower periods ) , p - waves are allowed .",
    "however , they are free to propagate throughout the entire star . since the sound - crossing time in the outer stellar mantle is extremely long and dissipative processes",
    "exist , the establishment of standing p - modes is prevented .",
    "hence , for all models and times , g - modes are trapped in the core , encompassing the fe core and frequently the si burning shell .    other salient features evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2andstruct ] are the spikes in @xmath94 , or equivalently , @xmath90 .",
    "these spikes are the result of @xmath64 , @xmath83 , and @xmath19 discontinuities at the boundaries indicated in table [ tab : boundaries ] .",
    "as impedance mismatches these spikes effectively reflect g - waves .",
    "therefore , even though most g - modes have their greatest amplitude near the center of the core , the reflecting boundaries imply that there might be sub - regions within the overall resonating cavity in which modes may be trapped .    by prodigious neutrino emission",
    ", the cores of massive stars continue to change their structures prior to the onset of core collapse ( woosley et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : timeprop ] illustrates the changes of the propagation diagram for the 13 m@xmath1 model during the last ten minutes of evolution . as the inner regions quickly evolve and contract , the brunt - visl frequency increases with time , gradually increasing the modal frequencies .",
    "in contrast , the model corresponding to @xmath95 s ( onset of collapse ) exhibits a dramatic truncation in the size of the resonating cavity , in that @xmath90 drops to negative values as the convective region grows due to implosive burning .",
    "however , collapse happens on a dynamical timescale , and will take 200 to 250 ms .",
    "given that the convective turnover times and the periods of oscillation are longer than this , the assumption of steady - state mixing - length convection is probably violated .",
    "although for completeness , results for the @xmath95 s models are presented here , the quantitative results at @xmath95 s should be viewed with healthy skepticism . at other times , the structural changes are gradual enough for our peturbation theory to be reliable .    in this paper ,",
    "the major sources and sinks of energy considered are nuclear burning , neutrino losses , and losses by coupling to outward propagating p - waves ( lai 2000b ) .",
    "since losses by radiation is overwhelmed by neutrino emission , perturbations in the radiative flux is ignored . throughout the fe core",
    ", neutrino losses dominate over energy deposition . only in the si- and o - burning shells",
    "do nuclear reactions allow the @xmath0-mechanism to operate .",
    "for the typical g - mode with its largest amplitudes in the center , neutrino losses will dominate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) , resulting in stability . however , potentially unstable modes are those that are trapped mostly in the outer part of the core near or in the si - burning region by the discontinuities in entropy , @xmath83 , and density ( lai 2000b ) .",

    "[ fig : propamp13]-[fig : tau30 ] , which are described in detail below .",
    "even though we did find modes for @xmath96 1 , 2 , 3 , and higher @xmath15s , we present the results only for @xmath96 1 , 2 , and 3 in table [ tab : growing ] . since the trends at higher @xmath15s are adequatly demonstrated with the set presented in this paper .",
    "in general , the most interesting spherical harmonics to consider are those with odd @xmath15 , or those with a top - bottom asymmetry .",
    "however even @xmath15s are interesting as well , as the nonlinear evolution of the perturbations into a kick may be triggered by any low order @xmath15 . since the dipole , @xmath97 , spherical harmonic most closely resembles the desired kick geometry , we focus in this section on @xmath97 , with peripheral mention of @xmath98 and 3 .",

    "these diagrams represent modes of the compact and extended profiles , respectively .",
    "note again , the spikes resulting from @xmath83 and @xmath100 discontinuities in @xmath94 and the existence of a resonance cavity confined by o - shell convection in the 13 m@xmath1 model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : propamp13 ] ) . because the o shell is farther out in mass for the more massive 30 m@xmath1 model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : propamp30 ] ) , the density and pressure profiles are more relevant in defining the resonant region . in both figures each horizontal line corresponds to a specific mode ; the shading encodes @xmath101 .",
    "dark and lighter shading signify low and high displacement , respectively , while blues denote stable modes and reds identify the unstable modes . figures [ fig : propamp13 ] and [ fig : propamp30 ] show that there are many more stable modes than unstable modes , which is true for all models at all times and for all @xmath15s .",
    "we also identify two classes of g - modes , inner - core and outer - core g - modes .",
    "inner - core g - modes have their greatest displacements toward the center and diminish with radius .",
    "their spacing in @xmath102 systematically decreases with increasing period and increasing number of half - wavelengths , @xmath103 .",
    "in contrast outer - core g - modes do _ not _ have their greatest amplitude in the center .",
    "they are trapped by discontinuites between the fossil fe core and the o shell in the case of the 13 m@xmath1 model and within the si burning shell in the case of the 30 m@xmath1 model .",
    "similar trapping exists for all other progenitors we consider .",
    "less than half of the outer - core g - modes are modes trapped entirely under the spikes ( i.e. surface g - modes ) .",
    "while these modes satisfy the adiabatic linear oscillation equations , their physical significance is not well constrained .",
    "their eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies depend on the spike widths and heights , which in turn depend upon the interface between convective and radiative regions in mixing - length theory . however , the results and conclusions we present in this paper are not predicated on their character or existence .",

    "in contrast , a simple wkb analysis fails to predict either the shape or the period of the outer - core g - mode shown in fig [ fig:13grow ] .",
    "instead , this mode s period and large displacement farther out in mass are determined by both resonance in the overall cavity and resonant trapping between disontinuities in density , @xmath83 , and entropy .    in the context of losses and gains in energy , fig .",

    "in addition , calculating full 3-d , non - linear , dynamical convection with nuclear reactions during the final stages of massive star evolution is a task for the future ; the progenitors and their g - modes may be significantly different than assumed or calculated here .",
    "we also have not considered coupling between convective modes and g - modes , which provides an excellent mechanism for the excitation of the 5-minute p - modes in the sun ( goldreich & kumar 1990 ) . in such analyses ,",
    "the amplitudes of the modes are estimated by assuming steady state is achieved in the nonlinear time - dependent amplitude equations . however , the short timescales until the onset of collapse would violate the assumption of steady state and invalidate such analyses .",
    "more importantly , it would be unlikely that the short timescales until the onset of collapse would allow for significant excitation of g - modes by convection",
    ".    on the other hand , the growth of perturbations in the supersonic regions during collapse does occur ( lai 2000a ; lai & goldreich 2000 ) . because we have not ruled out all possible sources of perturbations prior to collapse , asymmetries in the progenitor",
    "may still be relevant in producing the largest kicks .",
    "for example , convection in the last stages of evolution is often quite vigorous and may have mach numbers in the range 0.1 to 0.2 and density perturbations , @xmath141 , in the range 0.01 to 0.05 ( bazan & arnett 1998 ) .",
    "these perturbations may indeed be sufficient to produce the observed kicks ( burrows & hayes 1996 ) .",
    "in performing a stellar pulsational and stability analysis of the late - time cores of massive stars , we have identified many stable and unstable modes .",
    "we note that stability is predominantly determined by the neutrino losses or energy deposition by nuclear reactions . compared with the time until the onset of collapse , the timescales for growth and decay are long . in  [ sec : analytic ] , we argue that the long growth timescales ( compared with the time until the start of collapse ) are confirmed by energetic arguments .",
    "we suggest that the @xmath0-mechanism for g - mode growth does not generate the requisite perturbations prior to collapse needed to stimulate large kicks during the supernova explosion . therefore , we conclude that if the hydrodynamic mechanism in combination with progenitor perturbations is to succeed in explaining neutron star kicks other sources of seed perturbations",
    "must be investigated .",
