    "a common set of models to be studied in quantum mechanics are the anharmonic oscillators defined by the schrdinger equation @xmath4 any eigenfunction must obey the requirement that @xmath5 as @xmath6 and additionally satisfy either the dirichlet or neumann conditions at the origin .",
    "the anharmonic oscillators include the two exactly - solvable cases of the harmonic oscillator ( @xmath7 ) and infinite square well ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "for these two models the eigenvalues can be found in closed form , whereas for general @xmath9 numerical methods must be used .",
    "the dirichlet eigenvalues @xmath10 and neumann eigenvalues @xmath11 are associated to the spectral zeta function    @xmath12    wkb estimates show that @xmath13 as @xmath14 and hence @xmath15 converges for @xmath16 . in the two exactly - solvable cases @xmath15 can be given in terms of the riemann zeta function .",
    "however @xmath15 can also be calculated for @xmath17 , the most concise example being given by @xmath18    where @xmath19 and    @xmath20    the zeta functions @xmath21 can be also be calculated @xcite , although these functions involve a @xmath1 hypergeometric series and no example of a closed form expression has been given",
    ".    there has been much study related to these particular spectral zeta functions @xcite , with one significant result being the determination of ` sum rules ' which relate together different @xmath15 when @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "an elegant example of this is found for the quartic anharmonic oscillator , the first few sum rules being    [ quarticsrs ] @xmath22    the techniques for obtaining the sum rules , which will be covered later , are the consequence of a wider study known as exact quantisation , a review of many such problems being found in @xcite . for a review of the physical applications of spectral zeta functions in general ,",
    "we direct the reader toward @xcite .    we will consider a generalisation of ( [ ode0 ] ) given by the schrdinger equation @xmath23 with boundary conditions on the half - line .",
    "the eigenfunction criteria is that @xmath5 as @xmath6 , with the wavefunction having either of the behaviours @xmath24 or @xmath25 as @xmath26 .",
    "such eigenvalue problems have a long and rich history and have been investigated in many contexts such as quasi - exact solvability @xcite , integrable models @xcite and @xmath2-symmetry @xcite .    the two boundary behaviours @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively define two sets of spectra @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which we say are the eigenvalues of the ` regular ' and ` irregular ' radial problem@xcite . to these spectra",
    "we associate the zeta functions @xmath15 , which for @xmath29 are the functions defined in ( [ genzeta ] ) .",
    "however for general @xmath30 the regular and irregular problem are related by the analytic continuation @xmath31 @xcite , giving the zeta - function identity @xmath32    throughout @xmath30 will be restricted from taking the values @xmath33 where @xmath34 , although when @xmath35 the condition becomes @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the first restriction excludes the possibility that any @xmath37 could be equal to zero and the second restriction is to ensure linear independence of the @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite , a condition which is necessary for later work .",
    "finally , as the eigenvalues are known to have large-@xmath38 behaviour @xmath39 , the associated spectral zeta functions @xmath15 will converge when @xmath40 . as we will be studying @xmath15 for @xmath41 , we also restrict @xmath19 throughout .",
    "this paper will be divided into two sections and will investigate the radial eigenvalue problems ( [ ode ] ) .",
    "in section [ seccomp ] we use the well - known method involving green s functions to calculate @xmath15 when @xmath17 . then we will use the quantum wronskian equation to derive appropriate sum rules and give examples where @xmath42 can be written in closed form , including examples involving the anharmonic oscillators .",
    "similar techniques are then used to derive functional relations for two different hypergeometric series which appear in the expressions for @xmath43 and @xmath21 .",
    "these functional relations can recover many specific , known properties of hypergeometric series , as well as providing new identities . in section [ secpt ]",
    "we will extend our work to a class of eigenvalue problems commonly investigated in @xmath2-symmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "the zeta functions @xmath44 of these problems are studied for @xmath17 and found to be constructible by sum rules involving @xmath15 .",
    "these expressions for @xmath44 are then used in conjunction with the ode / i m correspondence @xcite to calculate the vacuum nonlocal integrals of motion @xmath3 which appear in a related quantum integrable field theory @xcite .",
    "given that the eigenvalues @xmath45 have no known closed form for general @xmath9 , naively we might expect that associated spectral zeta functions @xmath15 can not be given explicitly , except in the exactly - solvable cases .",
    "however when @xmath17 the zeta functions are computed using the process given in @xcite .",
    "although @xmath15 can be defined by analytic continuation when @xmath46 @xcite , generally there is no known method to calculate their explicit forms when @xmath47 takes general values . therefore we elect to consider @xmath15 only when @xmath17 , which we notate @xmath48 .    for a hermitian eigenvalue problem the eigenfunctions",
    "are complete and the green s function is written as @xmath49 where @xmath10 are the associated eigenvalues . as the irregular problem is generally non - hermitian ,",
    "the eigenfunctions are not guaranteed to be complete and consequently the green s function can not be written as in ( [ greensexpand ] ) .",
    "instead @xmath50 is defined by analytic continuation as in ( [ ancon ] ) , which is valid except for @xmath30 as in ( [ invalidlambda ] ) .    as the eigenfunctions in the hermitian case",
    "are necessarily orthonormal , the zeta functions are calculated by @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the integration over all positive space in @xmath53 dimensions . to evaluate this repeated integral ,",
    "@xmath54 is decomposed as a combination of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , two linearly - independent wavefunctions which solve the schrdinger equation when @xmath57 . for a radial problem",
    "the two wavefunctions have specific asymptotic behaviours ; @xmath55 must obey the boundary conditions at the origin and we require that @xmath58 as @xmath6 .",
    "the green s function is written as    @xmath59    where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the wronskian of the two solutions .",
    "thus @xmath63    now we specialise to the regular radial problem ( [ ode ] ) , which is solved for @xmath57 by @xmath64 here @xmath9 and @xmath65 are the whittaker functions @xcite and the wronskian of the two solutions is given by @xmath66=\\frac{2\\gamma(1 + 2\\sigma\\lambda ) } { \\gamma(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\sigma\\alpha}{2}+\\sigma\\lambda)}.\\ ] ] after making the change of variables @xmath67 and @xmath68 , we find that    [ ints ] @xmath69 and @xmath70    the evaluation of these integrals requires known identities from ( 7.625 ) in @xcite .",
    "the integral ( [ int1 ] ) can be calculated immediately and found to converge for @xmath71 , reproducing the restriction @xmath19 which was imposed earlier .",
    "completing the integration in ( [ int2 ] ) is more complicated and can be handled in a similar way to the calculation for the anharmonic operators as given in @xcite . completing the integrations",
    "gives the first two zeta functions    [ alphazp ] @xmath72 and @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the pochhammer symbol , @xmath75 is the generalised hypergeometric series and @xmath76 is the meijer - g function @xcite .",
    "the latter two functions are both evaluated at @xmath77 .    by setting @xmath35 ,",
    "the whittaker functions in ( [ int1 ] ) and ( [ int2 ] ) are replaced by bessel functions and the integration techniques directly follow those in @xcite .",
    "the zeta functions then take on the neater forms    [ azp ] @xmath78 and @xmath79    setting @xmath35 in ( [ alphazp1 ] ) also recovers ( [ azp1 ] ) directly by dixon s theorem .      for @xmath19",
    "the growth rate of the eigenvalues is sufficient to ensure the convergence of the spectral determinants @xmath80 here @xmath81 is a regularising prefactor designed to vanish when some @xmath82 . by analytic continuation we define @xmath83 except for the values of @xmath30 given in ( [ invalidlambda ] ) .",
    "in addition to the analytic continuation relating @xmath84 and @xmath85 , there is the quantum wronskian equation @xmath86 where @xmath87    the sets of eigenvalues @xmath10 and @xmath11 , having no relationship except at ( [ invalidlambda ] ) , are thus related to each other by a simple expression involving their associated spectral determinants .",
    "two clarifications need to be made regarding the quantum wronskian equation .",
    "first is to note that when @xmath88 the spectral determinants in ( [ qwradial ] ) refer to differential equations with imaginary coupling constants on the @xmath89 term , a problem which is remedied in @xcite .",
    "secondly , for general @xmath90 , the quantum wronskian links together four different spectral determinants , whereas setting @xmath35 reduces this number to two . for this latter case the subsequent results are much less complicated and so @xmath35 is fixed for the remainder of this section .    using ( [ qwradial ] ) , we can derive sum rules relating together different @xmath48 . for small @xmath91 the spectral determinants",
    "can be written in terms of their zeta functions @xcite as @xmath92    using the technique of @xcite , ( [ dexpandzeta ] ) is substituted into ( [ qwradial ] ) and the coefficients of the powers of @xmath91 are compared to obtain the radial sum rules .",
    "the first few of these are    [ rsr ] @xmath93    where @xmath94    under certain parameter choices , ( [ rsr ] ) allows for @xmath50 to be given in terms of spectral zeta functions with a simpler form . as an example",
    ", the choice @xmath95 implies that @xmath96 . at such a point ( [ rsr2 ] )",
    "does not include @xmath97 and hence , for @xmath98 , we find @xmath99 this expression is much less complicated than the general form for @xmath21 given in ( [ azp2 ] ) , reducing the @xmath1 hypergeometric series to a product of gamma and trigonometric functions .",
    "the anharmonic cubic oscillator has the zeta values @xmath100 and @xmath101    in addition to finding closed form expressions for @xmath48 , there is a reason to investigate the composite zeta functions @xmath102 for the potential @xmath103 with eigenfunction condition @xmath104 and eigenvalues @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are respectively the ` full ' and ` skew ' zeta functions , defined as @xmath108 for the anharmonic oscillators , these definitions correspond to ( [ compositezeta ] ) as the spectrum @xmath105 is the interlacing union of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for general @xmath90 and @xmath30 this can not be guaranteed .",
    "although generally used as a convenient notation , simplifications in the explicit forms of @xmath109 and @xmath110 will be of use later .",
    "the radial sum rules are used to find reduced forms for @xmath111 and @xmath112 by realising points where @xmath113 . for @xmath114",
    "we find @xmath115 and @xmath116    there are no simplifications for @xmath117 and no general simplifications for @xmath112 , as @xmath30 would conflict with ( [ invalidlambda ] ) .",
    "the anharmonic sextic oscillator has the zeta value @xmath118      while the radial sum rules in ( [ rsr ] ) are useful for determining properties of @xmath48 , they can also be used to determine properties of the special functions appearing in the explicit forms for @xmath48 , as in ( [ azp ] ) .",
    "the are two principle reasons that such derivations can be made .",
    "first is the analytic continuation ( [ ancon ] ) and the second is that the radial sum rules can be written as    [ ps ] @xmath119    these identities implicitly specify functional relations for the special functions appearing in ( [ azp ] ) . by substituting ( [ azp1 ] into ( [ ps1 ] ) and using ( [ ancon ] ) ,",
    "we recover the identity @xmath120 which is effectively two copies of the euler reflection formula for the gamma function .",
    "the next application is to the zeta functions @xmath21 , the explicit forms involving a @xmath1 hypergeometric series as in ( [ azp2 ] ) .",
    "therefore we expect to derive properties of the function @xmath121 substituting @xmath122 and @xmath21 into ( [ ps2 ] ) gives the functional relation @xmath123    furthermore , numerical testing indicates that this identity appears to hold when @xmath124 , although our result only applies when @xmath125 .    by choosing @xmath126 and @xmath30 to take special values - precisely those which give simple forms for @xmath42 - we recover further properties of @xmath127 .",
    "for example the simplification ( [ zp2simp ] ) gives , for @xmath98 , the identity @xmath128 when @xmath129 this identity is verified by dixon s theorem but we have been unable to find any known identities accounting for general @xmath98 . while @xmath127 can be rewritten in terms of @xmath130 hypergeometric series @xcite , this appears to provide no extra information and the functional identity ( [ 5f4func ] ) is not apparent .    the exact form of @xmath131 is known to contain appell series @xcite , functional relations for which being obtained by the above methods .",
    "we would then expect relationships between two different appell series in terms of @xmath1 hypergeometric series .",
    "the techniques used in section [ secspecderiv ] also apply when @xmath132 . in this situation",
    "the sum rules found from ( [ qwradial ] ) are more complicated , featuring four separate zeta functions . substituting ( [ dexpandzeta ] ) into ( [ qwradial ] ) ,",
    "the coefficient of @xmath91 in the subsequent expansion gives , after the transformation @xmath133 , @xmath134    where @xmath135 is given in @xcite as @xmath136    the explicit form for @xmath122 features a @xmath137 hypergeometric series as in ( [ alphazp1 ] ) .",
    "therefore ( [ alpharsr1 ] ) is implicitly a four - term functional relation involving this function .",
    "splitting into real and imaginary parts , ( [ alpharsr1 ] ) is actually two independent functional relations satisfied by the @xmath137 hypergeometric series .",
    "we define the function @xmath138    where the hypergeometric series converges for @xmath139 .",
    "substituting ( [ alphazp1 ] ) and ( [ d0 ] ) into ( [ alpharsr1 ] ) gives , after taking real and imaginary parts , the pair of four - term relations    [ calgident ] @xmath140 and @xmath141    this pair of equations allows for the derivation of three - term equations featuring @xmath142 .",
    "one such example is given by    @xmath143    now @xmath144 has been shown to satisfy a particular three term functional relation . from ( [ gthreeterm ] ) ,",
    "specific parameter choices allow for identities which only feature @xmath144 twice .",
    "one example is given by @xmath145 .",
    "when this is the case @xmath144 simplifies to a @xmath146 hypergeometric series , which is in - turn expressed in terms of gamma functions by gauss theorem .",
    "the subsequent relation is that    @xmath147    similar such reductions can be found by any simplification of the @xmath137 hypergeometric series in ( [ calgdef ] ) being substituted into the three - term relation in ( [ gthreeterm ] ) .",
    "now we consider a class of non - hermitian eigenvalue problems related to the radial problems of the previous section , given for @xmath148 by the schrdinger equation @xmath149 the boundary conditions are that @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a quantisation contour that asymptotes towards the anti - stokes rays with complex arguments @xmath152 .",
    "these anti - stokes rays are shown in figure [ stokespic1 ] .",
    "such a contour must also avoid the branch cut along the positive imaginary axis , employed to ensure that the potential is single - valued for general @xmath9 .",
    "surprisingly these schrdinger problems , with complex potentials and boundary conditions defined in the complex plane , can have an entirely real spectrum @xcite .",
    "the suggested reason for the possibility of spectral reality lies in the @xmath2-symmetry of the problem , meaning that ( [ kproblems ] ) and the boundary conditions are invariant under a reflection in the imaginary axis .",
    "specifically the spectrum is known to be real if the @xmath2-symmetry is unbroken , meaning that the eigenfunctions are invariant under the combined @xmath2 operation @xcite .",
    "the revelation of a non - hermitian problem exhibiting real eigenvalues has since spawned a huge research effort with hundreds of papers .",
    "recent review articles of the subject are also available @xcite .            rather than investigating spectral reality , our interest will be in the relationships between the radial problems in the previous section and the @xmath2-symmetric of this section . for fixed @xmath9 , different choices of @xmath153 will result in quantisation contours which asymptotically lie within different pairs of stokes sectors .",
    "generally these different problems are then expected to have unique spectra for fixed @xmath154 , as was demonstrated in @xcite . to these separate spectra",
    "we associate the eigenvalues @xmath155 and the spectral functions @xmath156 despite the different spectra appearing to have no obvious analytic relationship , in @xcite a number of results are given which link together different @xmath157 and hence the associated eigenvalues .",
    "following work in @xcite , using the normalisations in @xcite , one such result is the ` fused ' quantum wronskian equation @xmath158 where @xmath19 and @xmath30 is again restricted to exclude the values in ( [ invalidlambda ] ) .",
    "the fused quantum wronskian is essentially a simple extension of ( [ qwradial ] ) , which can be verified by setting @xmath159 and @xmath160 in ( [ qw ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath161 is understood to be a constant as the choice @xmath159 dictates that the quantisation contour of the eigenvalue problem asymptotically lies within two adjacent stokes sectors , meaning an empty spectrum @xcite",
    ". therefore any sum rules derived from ( [ qw ] ) must reproduce those derived from ( [ qwradial ] ) by setting @xmath159 and defining @xmath162 .",
    "in contrast to ( [ qwradial ] ) , the fused quantum wronskian will feature only two spectral determinants on the right hand side when @xmath132 and @xmath153 is odd . at such values of @xmath153",
    "the sum rules must be of similar form to those in ( [ rsr ] ) .      calculating @xmath163",
    "directly can be handled by the green s function method used previously .",
    "this was first implemented in @xcite for the anharmonic ( @xmath35 , @xmath29 ) oscillators , where the results were used to verify conjectures on the spectral reality of the @xmath2-symmetric problems .",
    "however there is an easier method than direct calculation , using sum rules and the exact forms for @xmath48 calculated in ( [ alphazp ] ) and ( [ azp ] ) . to determine sum rules between @xmath163 and @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath164 is expanded near the origin as @xmath165 the fused sum rules are calculated by substituting ( [ dexpandzeta ] ) and ( [ ckexpandzeta ] ) into ( [ qw ] ) and comparing coefficients of the powers of @xmath91 . temporarily suppressing the dependence on @xmath153 when @xmath88 , the first few fused sum rules are    [ fsr ] @xmath166    where @xmath167 for @xmath35 the fused sum rules apply for all @xmath153 , whereas for @xmath132 this is only true when @xmath153 is odd . in the latter situation @xmath168",
    "is given in terms of @xmath169 for @xmath170 and in terms of @xmath171 for @xmath172 .",
    "to calculate @xmath163 it is now only necessary to calculate @xmath173 , determine @xmath174 from ( [ ancon ] ) and then substitute these into the appropriate fused sum rule .",
    "this method implies that @xmath163 is always real - valued , despite no guarantee that the eigenvalues will be real .",
    "the explanation is that all @xmath2-symmetric systems have a real characteristic equation , implying that the eigenvalues are either real or appear in complex conjugate pairs @xcite .",
    "given the fundamentally differences between the radial problems and the @xmath2-symmetric problems , there is a priori no reason to expect such simple connections between the differing sets of spectra .",
    "specific examples of the fused sum rules can be written in many ways , depending on the relationships between @xmath175 and @xmath50 as determined by the radial sum rules ( [ rsr ] ) .",
    "the anharmonic quartic oscillator has the sum rules    @xmath176    as with the radial sum rules , the fused sum rules are also useful for deriving simplifications of @xmath163 .",
    "for example , comparing ( [ rsr2 ] ) and ( [ fsr2 ] ) shows for @xmath98 that @xmath177    the anharmonic cubic oscillator has the zeta value @xmath178    certain choices of @xmath9 and @xmath153 reduce the quantum wronskian to the form @xmath179 and hence give the zeta function identity @xmath180 .",
    "additionally ( [ fsr ] ) will allow for the form @xmath181 under appropriate parameter choices .",
    "therefore the simplifications for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , as in ( [ z2simp ] ) and ( [ tildez2simp ] ) , apply to @xmath182 .",
    "two examples of these are :    the quartic oscillator has the zeta value @xmath183    the anharmonic sextic oscillator has the zeta value @xmath184      an application for the fused sum rules in ( [ fsr ] ) is within the ` ode / im correspondence ' @xcite which links the eigenvalue problems in this paper to a class of integrable models . the correspondence , which was established by functional relations such as the quantum wronskian , is summarised in - depth in the review article @xcite .",
    "two essential components for realising the correspondence are the continuum analogues of the @xmath185- and @xmath186-operators which appear in the study of integrable systems such as the six - vertex model .",
    "these analogues were introduced in @xcite to study the integrable structure of conformal field theory .",
    "when @xmath19 and @xmath35 the vacuum eigenvalues of these analogues , denoted @xmath187 and @xmath188 , are related simply to the spectral determinants of the radial and @xmath2-symmetric problems .",
    "this remarkable connection was shown in @xcite and is summarised by the relations @xmath189 and @xmath190 under the parameter identifications @xmath191    considering ( [ thiseqn23 ] ) , direct relations are given in @xcite between the nonlocal integrals of motion ( ims ) @xmath192 , used in a power series expansion for @xmath188 , and the zeta functions @xmath175 .",
    "additionally conjectured in @xcite were analytic continuations for @xmath193 in terms of local ims @xmath194 and for @xmath195 in terms of nonlocal ims @xmath196 .",
    "therefore there appear to be good reasons to consider the spectral zeta functions in relation to the nonlocal ims .",
    "specifically we will work with @xmath3 , which were given in @xcite to be nonlocal ims appearing in the power series expansion @xmath197 these functions are found directly from the integral @xmath198^{2\\beta^2 } \\prod_{j > i}^n\\left[2\\sin\\left(\\frac{v_i - u_j}{2}\\right)\\right]^{-2\\beta^2 } \\prod_{j\\geq i}^n\\left[2\\sin\\left(\\frac{u_i - v_j}{2}\\right)\\right]^{-2\\beta^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the first of these being given simply as @xmath199    the nested integration required to calculate @xmath3 is reminiscent of the nested integration required to compute @xmath175 as in section [ seccomp ] .",
    "the difference is that while @xmath97 can be written exactly , no general form for @xmath200 is known , although alternative approaches have been used in @xcite . to calculate @xmath3 , ( [ thiseqn22 ] )",
    "is expanded on both sides as a power series by using ( [ ckexpandzeta ] ) and ( [ texp ] ) . comparing powers of @xmath47 and using @xmath201 @xcite , the first few @xmath3",
    "are found :    [ g ] @xmath202    now that @xmath3 are expressed in terms of the zeta functions @xmath203 , they can be written in terms of @xmath48 by ( [ rsr ] ) .",
    "this circumvents the need to calculate @xmath3 directly , expressing them instead in terms of zeta functions which can be calculated from work in the previous sections .",
    "given that @xmath175 becomes more complicated as @xmath53 increases , identities for @xmath3 are expected to reflect this property .",
    "however the integral expression for @xmath175 in ( [ gennested ] ) can always be given in terms of some infinite power series .",
    "this provides a computational advantage over ( [ gint ] ) , which has not been directly evaluated for @xmath204 .    the validity of ( [ g ] ) can be checked by first substituting ( [ azp1 ] ) into ( [ fsr1 ] ) . the general identity for @xmath205",
    "is then substituted into ( [ g1 ] ) and , after the variable changes in ( [ varsident ] ) , found to agree with ( [ g11 ] ) exactly .",
    "the process is simply extended to @xmath3 and the higher nonlocal ims giving , as an example , that @xmath206 where the identifications in ( [ varsident ] ) must be taken into account .",
    "this expression for @xmath200 can be checked to agree with some special cases given in @xcite .",
    "practically ( [ g2 ] ) provides little extra information over the methods given in @xcite due to the lack of known analytic properties of the @xmath1 hypergeometric terms appearing in ( [ azp2 ] ) .",
    "however the simplifications for @xmath182 , for example ( [ genreduc ] ) , allow for concise special values of @xmath200 to be found , in some cases being as simple as the general formula for @xmath207 .    for @xmath208 and @xmath209 the second nonlocal i m is given by @xmath210",
    "the above methods can be extended to compute @xmath211 and higher nonlocal ims .",
    "simplifications available by the sum rules would mean that , for specific parameter choices , @xmath211 can be given without having to calculate a general form for @xmath131 directly as in section [ seccomp ] .",
    "we have calculated the spectral zeta functions @xmath43 and @xmath21 pertaining to the radial problems in ( [ ode ] ) .",
    "using the quantum wronskian , sum rules were established which give relationships between the different @xmath48 . as well as illustrating the deep connections between the two problems , these sum rules allow for the simplification of @xmath21 with many examples found in the anharmonic oscillators .",
    "the physical reasons for such simplifications , if any , is not yet understood .",
    "our methods were then applied to determine special properties of the gamma function and specific hypergeometric series .",
    "we have not found another way to obtain the functional relations between these hypergeometric series and a separate derivation would be of interest .",
    "this technique could be applied in general to any schrdinger problems where sum rules can be established between the zeta functions .",
    "furthermore the functional relations established encodes many known , closed - form identities for specific hypergeometric series .",
    "a full study of this topic may therefore prove interesting in the future .    in section 3 the zeta functions @xmath163 of a related , @xmath2-symmetric problem",
    "were calculated not directly but using the fused sum rules relating them to @xmath48 .",
    "this requires fewer calculations than the direct method and serves to highlight the deep connections between the real - line and monodromy problems . after calculating @xmath163",
    ", we showed how the ode / i m correspondence can be used to calculate the vacuum nonlocal ims @xmath3 .",
    "this was restricted to @xmath35 , although we expect our work will be useful in testing the correspondence postulated in @xcite , where this restriction is not imposed .",
    "we deliberately excluded the possibility of a zero - energy eigenvalue .",
    "however our initial investigations show that this need not be the case . in particular we have found that spectral zeta functions can be used to detect the presence ( and classify the order ) of zero - energy exceptional points in non - hermitian eigenvalue problems .",
    "a natural application of this method is to the @xmath2-symmetric problems specified in ( [ kproblems ] ) , where the fused sum rules are used .",
    "we hope to work more on this in the future .",
