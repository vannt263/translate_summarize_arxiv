    "research in directed transport has been steadily evolving since the main idea re - emerged in the 60 s @xcite to consolidate into a well established field nowadays @xcite .",
    "out of equilibrium spatiotemporal periodic systems are at the heart of these investigations , where the second law of thermodynamics no longer applies .",
    "many disciplines have found the concept of ratchet transport very useful , they include such different areas as biology @xcite on one end and nanotechnology @xcite on the other . in chemistry , for example",
    "isomerization reactions have been recently characterized by directed transport properties @xcite .",
    "cold atoms @xcite and also bose - einstein condensates have been transported , these latter by means of quantum ratchet accelerators @xcite , where the current has no classical counterpart @xcite and the energy grows ballistically @xcite .",
    "this short list is incomplete and many other theoretical and experimental areas have been omitted here .    breaking all spatiotemporal symmetries leading to momentum inversion @xcite allows a net current . in particular , we are interested in deterministic ratchets with dissipation which have been historically associated with a classical asymmetric chaotic attractor @xcite .",
    "dissipative quantum ratchets , interesting for cold atoms experiments have been introduced in @xcite . in recent works , the parameter space of the classical counterpart of this system has been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "these new results have pointed out that not only chaotic attractors , but also several families of isoperiodic stable structures ( isss , which are lyapunov stable islands of different periods grouped into structures in parameter space , sometimes called `` shrimps '' due to their shape ) have a fundamental role in understanding the current behavior .",
    "moreover , they have been identified as a means to obtain optimal ratchet transport which is temperature resistant @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that these isss are a common feature , found in generic dissipative dynamical systems .",
    "in fact , some of their properties have recently been studied in the dissipative kicked rotator model @xcite .",
    "their quantum manifestations , the so - called qisss have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "there it has been found that the qisss look like the quantum chaotic attractors at their vicinity in parameter space ( these corresponding to values of the parameters where the classical counterparts are already chaotic ) , with the exception of comparatively few cases .",
    "recently , a complete parameter space picture has been obtained for the quantum system @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that a thermal coarse - graining of the classical dynamical equations ( i.e. , adding thermal noise of the order of @xmath0 ) is sufficient to obtain a good approximation for the qisss . in this paper",
    "we carry out a detailed spectral study of both the perron - frobenius operators associated with the classical evolution with thermal noise and the quantum superoperators without it , finding a great similarity between them . a known result in the decoherence literature @xcite states that diffusive",
    "noise makes the quantum mechanical spectrum converge to that of the coarse grained perron - frobenius , the diffusive process being applied to both the classical and the quantum cases . here",
    ", we find that for dissipative systems an effective way to reach the classical to quantum correspondence consists in applying a thermal ( diffusive - like ) noise solely at the classical level .",
    "we underline that this is not meant to be an example of the emergence of classicality @xcite .",
    "it is important to say that in this work all the possible representative asymptotic cases have been considered , i.e. those in which the classical limiting set is either simple ( in its main forms ) or chaotic .",
    "nevertheless a systematic study is left for the future .",
    "finally , we study the similarities and differences of relevant eigenvectors with the help of weyl - wigner distributions in phase space .",
    "thanks to this we are able to identify the limits of this correspondence mechanism .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the system under study , i.e. a modified kicked rotator with dissipation and the methods we use to investigate it from the classical to quantum correspondence perspective .",

    "this represents a particle moving in one dimension [ @xmath6 under the influence of a periodic kicked asymmetric potential : @xmath7 \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\\delta(t - m \\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the kicking period , also having a dissipation given by @xmath8 . when @xmath9 the particle is in the overdamped regime and when @xmath10 the evolution is conservative .",
    "breaking the spatial ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and temporal ( @xmath13 ) symmetries allows the net current generation . as is customary in this model",
    "the classical dynamics can be made dependent on the parameter @xmath14 by means of introducing the rescaled momentum @xmath15 . in order to consider a thermal noise of the order of @xmath0 , the effective planck constant which will be introduced in the quantum version , we simply change @xmath16 in eq .",

    "we have checked that the results obtained from the diagonalization are independent of the value of @xmath49 as long as @xmath50 , i.e. , the coarse graining inherent to the ulam procedure is smaller than the thermal fluctuations . in the following",
    "we will refer to the perron - frobenius operator but the calculations are understood to be done with its ulam approximation .    in the quantum case the evolution of the density matrix",

    "the first important thing we notice is that the eigenvalues that are closer to the unit circle remain approximately fixed as @xmath78 decreases .",

    "this strongly suggests that the actual classical dynamics is already reasonably captured .",
    "it is interesting to notice that for the largest @xmath74 , this does not happen in the case @xmath67 , where the expected point like structure is slightly embedded in a distribution resembling the neighboring chaotic attractor case .",
    "this indicates that in this region of the parameter space the greater coarse graining is still not sufficient to resolve neighboring maps with different properties .    for the isss cases , @xmath81 ( the eigenvalue following @xmath80 in decreasing order of their moduli ) is very close to @xmath82 in accordance with the very long times required for the equilibration of these structures . as can be seen from table [ tableequilibrationtimes ] the decay times @xmath83 given essentially by the value of the spectral gap @xmath84 ,",
    "are in fairly good agreement with the equilibration times obtained in @xcite by means of the ratchet currents .",

    "as can be seen from fig.[fig3 ] a ) a smearing out of the order of @xmath87 is enough to turn the classical points corresponding to the iss into a distribution of exactly the same shape of the quantum one depicted in fig.[fig3 ] b ) .",
    "the quantum - classical similarity is also striking for the 2nd eigenvector pair displayed in fig.[fig3 ] c ) and d ) . despite both having a negative image of the basin of attraction",

    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , panels c ) and d ) .",
    "they show that in these cases the coherences have a greater weight . anyway",
    "if we look carefully at the distributions they are quite alike for the remaining of the distributions .",

    "by studying the behavior of the spectra and eigenvectors of both the perron - frobenius operators with thermal noise and the quantum mechanical superoperators associated with the isss and chaotic attractors typical of a paradigmatic model for dissipative directed transport , we were able to identify a novel mechanism of classical to quantum correspondence hinted in @xcite ( just looking at the ratchet currents and asymptotic distributions ) .",
    "the remarkable coincidence of both sets of eigenvalues is indicative of an approximate formal equivalence between the classical and quantum realms . in the following we raise some important points derived from this result .",
    "firstly , it is interesting to link our approach with previous works . in @xcite",
    "the dissipative kicked top model was analyzed , with a special focus in the case where it decays to a chaotic attractor .",
    "there it was found that the quantum invariant state closely follows the structure of the classical attractor , without the finer details .",
    "it was also shown that in the semiclassical limit the leading eigenvalues of the quantum spectrum converge to the ones of the perron - frobenius , thus implying that the quantum mechanical time scales become independent of @xmath87 and coincide with time scales set by the ruelle resonances . in the present work the classical to quantum correspondence",
    "is investigated in representative regions of the parameter space of a paradigmatic dissipative ratchet system , corresponding to chaotic attractors and to isss as well .",
    "besides , we put the accent on small but finite @xmath0 values , for which we find a correspondence mechanism based on adding thermal noise at the classical level only .",
    "our approach is also clearly distinct from the usual way in which the quantum to classical correspondence is treated in the decoherence literature where the procedure consists in applying a diffusive noise to both the classical and the quantum equations in order for the spectra to converge to each other @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the consequences of this finding are relevant not only to directed transport but to dissipative systems in general .",
    "a very promising one is the possibility to approximate the quantum asymptotic state in the chaotic case by the classical dynamics with thermal noise corresponding to a simple attractor in its vicinity .",
    "this was previously conjectured in @xcite but now with the help of the weyl - wigner distributions we are able to show that this is indeed possible . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the differences due to coherences are minor .",
    "moreover , it is worth noticing that even when having a classical chaotic attractor the addition of thermal noise at this level is necessary in order to find a spectrum similar to the quantum one .",
    "hence , studying these effects could be interesting for many applications as for example in superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the long - lived sector of the quantum superoperators corresponding to any kind of structure in parameter space could be well approximated by means of perron - frobenius operators with thermal noise .",
    "this conclusion can be drawn from the remarkable similarity among the spectra for all the cases shown in sec .",
    "however , in our way to devise a classical approximation we have found a problem hardly visible using just husimi distributions as in @xcite .",
    "thanks to the weyl - wigner representations of sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we have found that the eigenvectors , even some long - lived ones , can have differences due to the coherences remaining in the quantum system . despite this , their weight seems to be not so important .",
