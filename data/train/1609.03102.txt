    "we consider the inverse scattering problem of reconstruction of physical and geometrical properties of three - dimensional objects from experimental multi - frequency data without using any detailed a priori knowledge of the targets .",
    "these targets are placed in air , and the measured data are the backscatter corresponding to a single incident wave .",
    "our study is mainly motivated by potential applications in detection and identification of explosives such as , e.g. , anti - personnel mines and improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) , see  @xcite .",
    "we note that ieds are also often buried under the ground for which one needs to study the corresponding inverse problem of determining buried objects .",
    "this topic is subject to a future publication , although such a study was performed by our group in an earlier publication using a different globally convergent inverse method  @xcite . at the same time , both ieds and mines can often be located in air and our current study models this case . the idea here is to determine the dielectric constants of targets .",
    "the knowledge of dielectric constants might serve in the future classification algorithms as a piece of information , which would be an additional one to those commonly currently used in the radar community .",
    "indeed , this community relies now only on the intensity of radar images , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the question of a reliable differentiation between explosives and clutter is not yet addressed satisfactory in the radar community .",
    "so , estimates of dielectric constants and of shapes of targets combined with the image intensity and other parameters might lead in the future to such classification algorithms , which would address this question better .",
    "the second potential application of our study is in nondestructive testing and materials characterization .",
    "the problem under consideration is also called the inverse medium problem or the coefficient inverse problem , i.e. , the problem of recovering of a coefficient of a partial differential equation from boundary measurements .",
    "there is a large body of literature on imaging methods for reconstructing geometric information about targets , such as their shapes , sizes and locations .",
    "we refer to , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein for well - known imaging techniques in inverse scattering such as level set methods , sampling methods , migration methods and shape optimization methods .",
    "however , for detecting or identifying , for instance , ieds , it would be certainly the physical properties of the target ( in our model , the dielectric constant ) , playing a more important role  weath2015 .",
    "furthermore , determining the spatially distributed dielectric constants , which is of our main interest , is known to be a more difficult task since this is a coefficient inverse problem .    among the inversion methods developed for solving the coefficient inverse problems ,",
    "the two probably most well known approaches are nonlinear approximation schemes and weak scattering approximation methods such as born approximation and physical optics , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "the weak scattering approximation is not applicable to the inverse problem under consideration , where the scattering objects can be strong scatterers .",
    "regarding the nonlinear optimization approaches or also known as iterative solution methods , we refer to  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is well - known that the convergence for this class of methods typically requires a good a priori initial approximation of the exact solution , that is , the starting point of iterations should be chosen to be sufficiently close to the solution .",
    "hence , we call such methods locally convergent",
    ". we note that in our desired applications such a priori knowledge is not always available .",
    "this limitation of nonlinear optimization approaches is avoided in the so - called approximately globally convergent method ( globally convergent method , for short , or gcm ) , which has been recently introduced by the second author and a collaborator , see @xcite .",
    "the gcm , which does not use optimization schemes , aims to provide a good approximation to the solution of the coefficient inverse problem without using any detailed a priori knowledge of the solution .",
    "more precisely , the concept  approximately globally convergence \" can be understood in the language of functional analysis as follows : under some reasonable approximate mathematical assumption the method provides at least one point in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact coefficient without a priori knowledge of any point in this neighborhood .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation or the distance between those points and the exact solution depends on the error in the data and some parameters of the discretization .",
    "we point out that the fact of the proximity of that point to the correct coefficient , which was achieved without any a priori knowledge of that small neighborhood , is the main advantage of our globally convergent method over locally convergent ones .",
    "indeed , as soon as one knows a point in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the true solution , one can refine it via a locally convergent method , see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 4 ) .",
    "the latter , however , is outside of the scope of the current publication .",
    "we refer to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.9.4 ) and  @xcite for more details about the definition of the global convergence as well as a rigorous mathematical analysis of the global convergence of the method relying on some approximate mathematical framework .",
    "the performance of the gcm for experimental data has been investigated in  @xcite .",
    "we remark that in most of established results for the gcm the model of hyperbolic wave type equations is considered and the time - domain problem is converted into the pseudo - frequency domain problem via the laplace transform .",
    "consequently , all past experimental data studies for the method addressed the time - domain data .",
    "we note that since the laplace transform used in the method has an exponentially decaying kernel , one likely loses some information in taking this transform of the ( far field ) measured data . to improve the performance of the gcm and to extend its direct application to multi - frequency data , which is common in applications to materials characterization  @xcite ,",
    "a fourier transform version of the gcm has been recently developed in  @xcite . by fourier",
    "transform version we mean an extension of the gcm for the inverse scattering problem for the helmholtz equation . in the paper @xcite numerical examples for simulated data",
    "are also presented .    as a continuation of the work of  @xcite , the goal of this paper is to analyze the performance of the refined gcm for multi - frequency experimental data that were collected using a microwave scattering facility at the university of north carolina at charlotte .",
    "the descriptions above already state the new features of the present paper . to summarize it again , the globally convergent approach together with its advantages makes this work different from previously known locally convergent methods .",
    "compared to the previous works of our group on experimental data , this one is the first where we study the experimental multi - frequency data for the refined gcm of @xcite . the data preprocessing procedure for these multi - frequency data , discussed in the next paragraph , is substantially different from that of the time domain data in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we remark that our measured data are stable only on a small interval of frequencies surrounding the central frequency of 3.1 ghz , see section  [ sect : centralfreq ] .",
    "therefore , transforming these data into time domain by the inverse fourier transform may lead to a large inaccuracy in the time - dependent data obtained .",
    "that means that time domain inversion techniques including the previous versions of gcm  @xcite are not a good candidate for the inverse problem under consideration .",
    "it is worth to mention that there has been a considerable interest on testing inversion algorithms against experimental data , see , e.g. ,  belke2005,litma2009 .",
    "the data in the latter papers , which are from the institute fresnel s database , were collected in an anechoic chamber which would prevent the data from being corrupted by unwanted signals generated by reflections from various objects in the room .",
    "these data are actually very well matched to those in simulations as described in  @xcite .",
    "the inversion methods tested for these data are among the most popular approaches mentioned above for the coefficient inverse problems . however , keeping in mind our desired application to the detection and identification of ieds , we did not arrange a special anechoic chamber .",
    "our data has been collected in a more realistic condition of a regular room , that is , the room contains office furniture , computers , etc .",
    ", see figure  [ fi:1 ] .",
    "this leads to the fact that the measured data and the simulated data have a huge misfit , see figure  [ fi:2 ] , which is a true challenge for any inversion method .",
    "we note that conventional data denoising techniques do not help with the measured data because of its richer structure .",
    "we hence present a _ heuristic _",
    "data preprocessing procedure , which aims to make the raw data look somewhat similar to the corresponding simulated data .",
    "the preprocessed data are then used as the input for the gcm .",
    "our test results show that the gcm can reconstruct the dielectric constant of the scattering objects with a good accuracy as well as its geometric information such as location . in doing so",
    ", we do not use any detailed a priori knowledge on physical and geometrical properties of the targets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : fp ] , we state the forward and inverse scattering problems . section  [ sect : fp4 ] is devoted to a short description of the globally convergent method .",
    "we describe in section  [ sect : imag ] the data collection and the steps of data preprocessing .",

    "we assume that the scattering medium , which occupies a bounded domain @xmath3 , is isotropic , non - magnetic and that it is characterized by the spatially distributed dielectric constant @xmath4 , which is also called the relative permittivity .",

    "the total field @xmath8 is the sum of the scattered field @xmath9 and the incident field @xmath10 , propagating along the @xmath11-direction toward the scattering medium .",
    "we note that the scattered field @xmath9 satisfies the sommerfeld radiation condition  , which guarantees that it is an outgoing wave .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is frequency - independent , real - valued , @xmath12 and that there exists a positive constant @xmath13 such that @xmath14the latter condition in   means that the medium outside @xmath15 is homogeneous .",

    "* chapter 8) .",
    "our assumption of the frequency independence of @xmath17 is justified by the fact that in our inverse algorithm of @xcite we actually work on a small interval of wavenumbers @xmath19 .",
    "our direct experimental measurements of the dielectric constants of targets have shown that they vary slowly with respect to @xmath19 on small @xmath20intervals .",
    "we now formulate our inverse problem which is the main subject of the paper . to this end",
    "let us define @xmath21 as a convex bounded domain with its regular boundary @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",

    "the mathematical justification of the globally convergent method  kliba2016 has been done only for measurements on the entire boundary @xmath28 . in our numerical implementation",
    "we would need to complement the backscatter data on the rest of the boundary @xmath34 .",
    "we show how this is done in section  [ sect : completion ] .",
    "since we consider only a single direction of the incident plane wave @xmath35 , then this is an inverse problem with single measurement data .",
    "given such data , we emphasize that in our coefficient inverse problem we aim to reconstruct the coefficient @xmath4 using a numerical algorithm .",
    "the question whether @xmath36 can be uniquely determined from the data is outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "this is also one of the fundamental theoretical questions in the field of inverse problems .",
    "the first uniqueness result for multidimensional coefficient inverse problems with single measurement data was established in  @xcite , where the authors introduced a method based on carleman estimates .",
    "this method has been extensively studied by a number of authors for uniqueness theorems in inverse problems with a finite number of measurements .",

    "now we are ready to summarize the globally convergent method as a computational algorithm in the next section .      in the algorithm below we use @xmath103 for the inner iterations which play a role in updating the tails as indicated in  @xcite .",
    "\\(i ) the criterion for choosing the final result for @xmath17 and the stopping rules with respect to @xmath91 and @xmath103 in the iterations are addressed in section  [ sect : stopping ] of the numerical implementation .",
    "we also refer to  @xcite for stopping criteria developed for the numerical verification for globally convergent methods .",
    "recall that the number of iterations is often considered as a regularization parameter in the theory of ill - posed problems , see for instance  @xcite .",

    "some details about solving these two problems can be found in the section  [ sect : details ] of the numerical implementation .",
    "the initial approximation @xmath72 of the tail function plays an important role in both numerical implementation and the convergence analysis .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for more details on how the convergence of the algorithm depends on the initial tail function . using an asymptotic expansion with respect to @xmath19 for the solution @xmath32 to the forward problem  ",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that there exists a function @xmath106 such that @xmath107since @xmath25 is sufficiently large , then dropping the term @xmath108 in   for @xmath109 @xmath110 we obtain @xmath111 for @xmath109 @xmath112 hence , we approximate the initial tail function as @xmath113 since by   @xmath114 , then @xmath115 . substituting these approximations in   and   at @xmath116 , we obtain that the function @xmath117 is the solution of the following dirichlet boundary value problem @xmath118we refer to  @xcite for more details on the derivation of the latter boundary value problem as well as a discussion on its unique solvability .",

    "this means that the error in the first tail function depends only on the error in the boundary data .",
    "therefore , we obtain a good approximation for the tail function already in the zero iteration of our algorithm",
    ". however , our numerical experience tell us that we need to do more iterations . the approximation and , as a result , the assumption   form our reasonable approximate mathematical assumption mentioned in introduction .",
    "we note that   and   are used only on the zero iteration of our algorithm and are not used for other tail functions , which are obtained in the iterative process of our algorithm .    with the choice   of @xmath72 , it was proved in  @xcite that the algorithm proposed in section  [ sect : algorithm1 ]",
    "converges in the sense that it provides a good approximation for the coefficient @xmath124 .",

    "we note that no a priori information about a small neighborhood of the unknown coefficient is used here .",
    "therefore we say that our algorithm is globally convergent within the approximation framework  .",
    "we describe in this section the experimental setup , how the data were collected , and an important part of this paper : the data preprocessing procedure .",
    "the measurement data has been collected in a regular room , see figure  [ fi:1 ] . as mentioned in introduction , keeping in mind our desired applications , we did not want to arrange a special anechoic chamber . on the measurement plane , which is a 1 m by 1 m area",
    ", we define that the @xmath125-axis and the @xmath126-axis are the horizontal and the vertical axis , respectively , while the @xmath11-axis is perpendicular to the measurement plane .",
    "the direction from the target , whose front face is positioned at @xmath127 , to the measurement plane is the negative direction of the @xmath11-axis .",
    "the source and receiver in the experiments are both from the same device , a 2 port rohde @xmath128 schwarz vector network analyzer ( vna ) , connected by 2-meter megaphase rf killer bee test cables . the broadband horn antenna and the collecting probe are both connected to the vna .",
    "the antenna is positioned at a distance of about 75 cm from the targets and 18 cm from the  wooden wall \" of figure  [ fi:1](a ) , where the probe ( i.e. detector ) is located .",
    "for some technical reasons it was impossible to place the antenna behind that  wooden wall \" .",
    "the vna sends single frequency signals at frequencies ranging from 1 ghz to 10 ghz via the horn antenna . actually by design",
    "the signal is also emitted from the probe at the same time .",
    "this probe technically collects both emitted and reflected signals , more precisely their scattering parameters ( @xmath129-parameters ) .",
    "however , the vna is designed such that the reflection in the signal to each device is calibrated , that is , the internal reflections are removed .",
    "therefore , the measured data are supposed to be as close to just the wave scattered by the unknown target as possible . for the range of frequencies from 1 ghz to 10 ghz",
    "we collect the scattered wave at 300 frequency points uniformly distributed over that range .    to obtain the backscatter data on the measurement plane for a single incident wave the experiment is repeated for different positions of the probe on the measurement plane , which is the above mentioned wooden wall .",
    "more precisely , the probe is uniformly moved over the scanning area with the step size 2 cm , that means a total of 2550 data points .",
    "we scale to dimensionless variables by considering @xmath130 for the convenience in our numerical implementation .",
    "therefore , from now on when we see , for example @xmath131 of length this means @xmath132 cm .",
    "let @xmath133 be the electric field .",
    "the component @xmath134 was incident upon the medium and the backscatter signal of the same component was measured . as it is stated in section  [ sect : centralfreq ] , our central frequency is 3.1 ghz which corresponds to the wavelength @xmath135 cm .",
    "this means that the source / target distance was 7.75 @xmath136 .",
    "since this distance is sufficiently large in terms of @xmath137 , we have treated the incident wave as a plane wave @xmath138 .",
    "the mismatch between experimental data and simulated data is huge as one can see in figure  [ fi:2 ] .",
    "therefore , to invert the measured data using the globally convergent method , we need a _ heuristic _",
    "data preprocessing procedure .",
    "the goal of the latter process , which mainly includes data propagation , truncation and calibration , is to make the experimental data somehow look similar to computationally simulated data .",
    "+      this is one of the most important steps in data preprocessing .",
    "given the experimental data on the measurement plane , the data propagation process aims to approximate these data on a plane which is closer to the unknown target than the measurement plane .",
    "this process firstly reduces the computational domain for our algorithm and secondly makes the scattered field data to look more focused .",
    "this is done using a well known method in optics called the angular spectrum representation , see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) .",
    "we note that this technique has been successfully exploited in  @xcite for data preprocessing for the globally convergent method of @xcite .",
    "we recall that the negative @xmath11-direction is from the target to the measurement plane . denote by @xmath139 the experimental data defined on the measurement rectangle @xmath140 of the plane @xmath141 and by @xmath142 its approximation on the propagated rectangle @xmath143 of the plane @xmath144 we set both functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 to be equal to zero on those parts of corresponding planes @xmath141 and @xmath147 which are outside of those rectangles . abusing notations a little bit , we call below sets @xmath148 and @xmath149  measurement plane \" and  propagated plane \" respectively .",
    "we have @xmath150 since @xmath149 is closer to the target than @xmath148 . using the method of the angular spectrum representation , we obtain @xmath151}{\\mathrm{d}}k_{x}{\\mathrm{d}}k_{y},\\]]where @xmath152the idea of the method is that we consider the helmholtz equation satisfied by the total wave outside the scattering medium ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "then the fourier transform with respect to @xmath125 and @xmath126 of the total field satisfies an ordinary differential equation in the @xmath11-direction .",
    "together with the radiation condition and the boundary condition on the measurement plane @xmath148 one can solve the 1d problem and obtain the formula  .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for more details on the angular spectrum representation . in figure",
    "[ fi:3](d ) we present the absolute value of the experimental data on the propagated plane @xmath154computed by the formula   for the wavenumber @xmath155 . comparing figure  [ fi:3](c ) and figure  [ fi:3](d ) , we can easily see that the focusing of the scattered field is considerably improved after data propagation .",
    "+      we recall that for each of 300 frequencies from 1 ghz to 10 ghz the measured data is a set of 2550 points uniformly distributed on the measurement plane .",
    "an important fact to note is that the data both before and after propagation are stable only for a certain small interval of frequencies . by stable here we mean that the variation of the data with respect to the frequency is relatively small",
    "therefore , choosing an interval of frequencies for which the data is most stable or equivalently its variation with respect to the frequency in that interval is the smallest compared to any other intervals is essential for our algorithm .",
    "we choose such an interval by manually plotting the absolute value of the propagated data for all frequencies .",
    "it turned out that the data is most focused and stable with respect to the frequency around 3.1 ghz ; this can also be seen in figure  [ fi:4 ] , where we plot the absolute value of the propagated data , which is written as a matrix of @xmath156 .",
    "the stable interval of frequencies from figure  [ fi:4 ] is @xmath157 $ ] ghz , that equivalently means , @xmath78=\\left[6.25,6.70\\right]$ ] is the stable interval of wavenumbers used in our theoretical setting in the previous sections .",
    "we have observed that the lower and upper bounds of such intervals differ only very slightly for the data of different targets considered in this paper .",
    "note that we now consider only the propagated data since we will use these data instead of the original one .",
    "we know from section  [ sect : centralfreq ] that the variation with respect to the frequency of the propagated data around 3.1 ghz is the smallest compared to that of any other interval of frequencies .",
    "however , this variation is still not small enough for our algorithm .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the absolute value of the propagated data is still not close to those in simulations .",
    "indeed , we observe that after data propagation the magnitude of the simulated data has a clear peak at the @xmath158-location of the target for all frequencies , see figure  [ fi:5](b ) . for propagated measured data ,",
    "although its magnitude always attains the maximum at the @xmath158-location of the target for all frequencies around 3.1 ghz , it does not really have a clear peak as in simulations due to local maxima at other regions of the propagated plane , see figure  [ fi:3](c ) .",
    "however , those latter local maxima are not located at the same locations for different frequencies . on the other hand the global maximum",
    "is located at the same place for all frequencies around 3.1 ghz . from this important observation",
    "we guess that the target should be actually located in some small neighborhood of the global maximum of the propagated data .    to make the propagated measured data look more similar to those in simulations we truncate those by taking the points for which its magnitude is greater than or equal to @xmath159 of its maximum value , and setting the rest to be zero . in other words",
    ", for each @xmath160 $ ] we replace the function @xmath161 with the function @xmath162 where @xmath163 after that we smooth the function @xmath164 by a gaussian filter , more precisely , we use the smoothing function ` smooth3 ` in matlab with the gaussian option .",
    "this is done for all values of @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "we display in figure  [ fi:5 ] the propagated data after this procedure .",
    "it can be seen that the behavior of the absolute value of these processed data looks more similar to that of simulated data .",
    "we are now at the last step of data preprocessing called data calibration .",
    "this process is to scale the amplitude of the measured data to the same scaling as in our simulations , since the experimental data and simulated data usually have quite different amplitudes .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fi:5 ] , we can see that the maximal value of the absolute value of measured data is about 0.0065 while this value is about 0.4 for the simulated data . to do the scaling we need the so - called the calibration factor .",
    "for estimating the calibration factor , we use the measured data of a single calibrating object whose location , shape , size , and dielectric constant are known .",
    "the word  single \" is important here to ensure that the calibration procedure is unbiased , that means , we are supposed to know such information for only the calibrating object .    for @xmath165 $ ] , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are chosen from the process of choosing a stable frequency interval of section  [ sect : centralfreq ] , let @xmath166 and @xmath167 be the propagated data of the simulated and measured scattered field for the calibrating object , respectively .",
    "we define our calibration factor as @xmath168 it can be seen that the amplitude of @xmath169 has the same scale to that of the simulated data .",
    "we use the calibration factor @xmath170 for measured data of all other objects .",
    "more precisely , given the propagated and truncated scattered field data @xmath164 in  , we consider @xmath171 as the input for our algorithm in section  [ sect : algorithm1 ] .",
    "we emphasize that this calibration factor is computed using the geometrical and physical information of only a single object : the calibrating object .",
    "we describe in this section some details of the numerical implementation and present the reconstruction results for our experimental data using the globally convergent algorithm . due to some technical limitations ,",
    "we have collected experimental data for five objects .",
    "so , we test here these five data sets .",
    "each data set corresponds to a single scattering object , numbered from 1 to 5 , see table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "object 1 ( a piece of yellow pine ) is chosen as our calibrating object .    .scattering objects [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we display in figures  [ fi:6 ] , [ fi:7 ] and  [ fi:8 ] the 3d - visualizations of exact and reconstructed geometry of the first four targets using ` isosurface ` in matlab . in the isosurface plotting the isovalue was chosen to be 50% of the maximal value of the computed @xmath17 .",
    "this choice is simply based on the calibrating object and is applied to all other objects . from the figures we can see that locations of the targets are well - reconstructed .",
    "it can also be seen that although the shape reconstruction of targets is in general not very good , the results for spherical shaped objects 3 , 4 and 5 seem to be better than those of rectangular prism ones ( objects 1 and 2 ) , which is reasonable .    in conclusion , we can see from the reconstruction results that , under the above procedure of data preprocessing , our multi - frequency globally convergent method can image quite well the dielectric constants and locations of targets for our experimental data .",
    "this is achieved regardless on the fact that there is a huge misfit between these data and simulations .",
    "we note that these are only backscatter data associated with a single incident field .",
    "moreover , the method can reconstruct relatively large inclusion / background contrasts , the case that is well known to be difficult for conventional least - squares approaches .",
