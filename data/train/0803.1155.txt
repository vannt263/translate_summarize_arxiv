    "the heavy fermion superconductor upt@xmath0 is regarded as an archetypal strongly correlated fermi liquid . at high temperatures ,",
    "the uranium 5f electrons show local moment curie  weiss behaviour , and they strongly scatter the conduction electrons to give a large resistivity . below a few degrees kelvin , however , the scattering becomes coherent , and quasiparticle bands populated by massive charged fermions form .",
    "indirect evidence for the existence of heavy quasiparticles comes from thermodynamic and transport properties , for example , the enormous linear coefficient of the specific heat , @xmath1 mj(mole u)@xmath2k@xmath3 @xcite , a similarly huge ( and anisotropic ) pauli - like susceptibility , @xmath4 and @xmath5 m@xmath6(mole u)@xmath7 for fields along the @xmath8-axis and in the basal plane , respectively @xcite , and a very large @xmath9 coefficient of the resisitivity , @xmath10@xmath11k@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "more direct evidence comes from optical conductivity @xcite and from the observation of a fermi liquid contribution to the dynamical magnetic susceptibility as measured by inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "taillefer and lonzarich provided the most direct evidence for the existence of the heavy fermi liquid , with their measurements of quantum oscillatory magnetization  the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) effect @xcite .",
    "they observed at least five distinct extremal orbits of the fermi surface , with quasiparticle masses of up to 100 @xmath12 .",
    "all of the observed surfaces could be interpreted by comparison with relativistic band structure calculations @xcite , which predict the multi - sheeted fermi surface shown in figure [ valence_fs ] .",
    "the observed quasiparticle masses were enhanced by between 10 and 20 in comparison with the calculated band mass .",
    "increasing the calculated contribution to @xmath13 of each fermi surface sheet by the ratio of the measured to the calculated effective mass gave good agreement with the total measured linear coefficient of the specific heat : that is , these five sheets of the fermi surface were found to account within error for the observed low temperature linear specific heat coefficient @xcite .",
    "these dhva studies of upt@xmath0 , and their interpretation , were very influential in the development of our present understanding of heavy fermion systems , so it is essential to establish them unambiguously , the more so because the interpretation of the dhva data has recently been called into question by an alternative proposal that two of the uranium @xmath14-electrons are localized in upt@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this proposal has the attractive feature that it offers a specific mechanism for producing quasiparticle mass enhancements : the exchange interaction between the itinerant and localized f - electrons .",
    "however , this explanation of the mass enhancement is not unique : in addition to the well - established kondo - lattice mechanism  @xcite which is believed to explain heavy masses in itinerant 1f cerium heavy fermion compounds , such as ceru@xmath15si@xmath15  @xcite , one can get large mass enhancements from coupling of conduction electrons to their own collective spin - fluctuations  @xcite as in mnsi ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the argument for adopting the ` partially localized ' model rests on the claim that it gives a better description of of the fermi surface than the original ` fully itinerant ' model .",
    "one of the central goals of this paper is to critically examine this claim .",
    "there are other reasons why it is important that we understand the electronic structure of upt@xmath0 .",
    "upt@xmath0 is the archetypal multi - component superconductor ( for reviews see references @xcite ) , showing three distinct superconducting phases below @xmath16 .",
    "it is crucial that the correct fermi surface be employed in attempting to model thermodynamic measurements in the superconducting state ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and that the correct elementary excitations are used in trying to understand the superconducting pairing mechanism : in particular , the symmetry of the pair state will be sensitive to the details of the electronic structure of upt@xmath0 .    from a theory perspective",
    ", the nature of the fermi surface comes to the heart of the debate concerning the behavior of f - electrons in condensed matter systems .",
    "are they localized , itinerant , or is a ` dual ' model ( partially localized and partially itinerant ) more appropriate ?",
    "for instance , in upd@xmath0 , a local - f model gives a good description of the fermi surface @xcite , whereas it gives a very poor description of the fermi surface of upt@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "since upt@xmath0 sits near the borderline between local and itinerant behavior , it is not a priori clear whether a ` dual ' or a ` fully itinerant ' picture is more appropriate .",
    "finally , there is obvious interest in improving the accuracy of band structure calculations for correlated electron systems , and upt@xmath0 provides a good test case since it sits very nicely between magnetic d - electron metals , which have fairly broad bands and for which local density approximation ( lda ) calculations seem to work well , and more strongly correlated metals , such as sodium cobaltate , in which it is claimed that lda calculations give an incorrect electronic structure @xcite .",
    "in this paper , the aspect of electronic structure that we focus on is the fermi surface . using the onsager relation ( see below ) a dhva oscillation frequency",
    "can be convered into a cross - sectional area of a sheet of the fermi surface that is ` extremal ' ( a maximum or minimum ) in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the applied magnetic field . by rotating the crystal in the field the angle dependence of these extremal areas",
    "can be followed .",
    "it is sometimes possible to derive the shape of the fermi surface directly from such data , but in practice it is usually necessary to interpret the data by comparison with the fermi surfaces predicted by band structure calculations .",
    "taillefer and lonzarich @xcite used a fermi surface generated by norman @xcite , who calculated the band structure assuming that all the uranium 5f electrons are itinerant ( i.e. that the fermi volume includes these electrons ) .",
    "this fermi surface , shown in figure [ valence_fs ] together with the path in @xmath17-space of several of the allowed extremal orbits , was in general agreement with earlier calculations  @xcite , but there are differences in detail .",
    "five bands cross the fermi energy , and the five panels of figure [ valence_fs ] show the resulting sheets of the fermi surface : ( band 1 ) a disc - shaped hole surface centred on the @xmath18 point of the brillouin zone ; ( band 2 ) a multi - connected hole surface centred on @xmath18 with arms branching out to reach the zone boundary between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; ( band 3 ) a large @xmath21-centred electron surface with subsidiary electron pockets centred at @xmath22 ; ( band 4 ) and ( band 5 ) two smaller @xmath21-centred electron surfaces .",
    ".comparison of notation used for fermi surfaces of upt@xmath0 : the ` band number ' is the notation used by norman @xcite and in this paper .",
    "the other references are : joynt and taillefer @xcite ( a review article on the superconductivity ) ; taillefer and lonzarich @xcite ; kimura @xcite ; zwicknagl @xcite .",
    "` colour ' is the colour scheme used to represent a given band on plots of dhva versus angle . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     an additional important difference from previous studies is that we have followed the @xmath23 orbit all the way to the c - axis , whereas previously it had only been followed to within about 20@xmath24 of @xmath25 .",
    "the significance of this is discussed below .",
    "13.0 cm    the lines on figure [ norman_angle ] are the predictions of the fully itinerant  model ( as per figure [ freqs_vs_fs ] ) , and in the subsequent figure , figure [ zwicknagl_angle ] , we show the data together with the predictions of the partially localized  model ( figure [ zwicknagl_freqs ] ) . in the next section ,",
    "we carry out a detailed comparison between the data and the predictions of the models .",
    "the extreme angle dependence of the dc - magnetoresistance , shown in figure [ r_vs_b_and_theta ] , can be explained following taillefer @xcite who argue that it arises from canonical @xmath26 effects .",
    "they point out ( a ) that the large magnetoresistance seen at most angles is indicative of an open orbit , since upt@xmath0 is compensated and therefore ought not to have a magnetoresistance unless there are open orbits , and ( b ) that the low magnetoresistance with the field along the @xmath27-axis is plausibly explained if the open orbit spans the arms of the band 2 surface , as shown in figure [ valence_fs](b ) . within this explanation , in @xcite a strongly anisotropic magnetoresistance was not seen because their measurement was made at too high a temperature and in a lower quality crystal , so that the @xmath28 condition was not reached .",
    "( to observe an open orbit in the magnetoresistance , the quasiparticle mean free path must be at least long enough that quasiparticles , driven by the lorentz force , can cross the brillouin zone before they scatter . ) similarly , the reason we see a stronger magnetoresistance than taillefer @xcite is because our sample is purer , and so has a larger value of @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath29 interpretation is further supported by taillefer @xcite , who show that the transverse magnetoresistance , with @xmath30 lying between the @xmath27- and @xmath31-axes , rises dramatically only at temperatures below 0.6 k , that is , when the fermi liquid thermal scattering rate falls below @xmath32 , as expected from an @xmath26 effect .",
    "we note that , if the dip in the magnetoresistance at @xmath33 shows that an open orbit runs diagonally across the band a-2 surface from one arm to the other , then the dip at @xmath31 appears to suggest a second open orbit , possibly running non - centrally along the top of the band 2 surface .",
    "we have also indicated this possible open orbit in figure [ valence_fs](b ) .    within the fully itinerant  picture",
    "there is thus excellent agreement between the topology of the band 2 surface and the angle dependence of the magnetoresistance .",
    "however , the z1 fermi surface in the partially localized  model also has open orbits , very similar to those of the band 2 surface of the fully itinerant  model , so the angle - dependent magnetoresistance alone does not discriminate between these models .",
    "however , the existence of these open orbits must be kept in mind in considering any fine - tuning of the partially localized  model that will be required to obtain agreement with the quantum oscillation data .    turning to the quantum oscillations",
    ", we firstly note that there are major differences in the predictions of the fully itinerant  and partially localized  theories . at the coarsest level of comparison ,",
    "it is evident that the partially localized  model predicts many fewer dhva frequencies than does the fully itinerant  model .",
    "this mostly reflects the absence in the partially localized  model of a surface corresponding to the band 2 ` octopus ' , as this surface generates many orbits in the fully itinerant  model .",
    "it is at this coarsest level of comparison that the deficiencies of the partially localized  model are perhaps most evident , because it simply predicts many fewer dhva orbits than are actually observed .",
    "the frequencies labelled @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 find no explanation in the partially localized  model , nor do the three frequencies between 1.5 and 2.5 kt near the @xmath31-axis , ascribed in @xcite to breakdown orbits between the band 1 and band 2 surfaces of the fully itinerant  model .",
    "also , the @xmath44 oscillation , arising from band 1/z1 , is clearly observed in the data to extend across the @xmath27@xmath8-plane , whereas in the partially localized  model it should not appear in this plane at all , due to the open orbits on the z1 surface .",
    "we can understand the nature of these deficiencies better via a more detailed level of quantitative , band - by - band comparison .",
    "starting with band 3/z3  the largest , most thermodynamically relevant , sheet of the fermi surface  as pointed out by zwicknagl @xcite , the z3 surface is in better quantitative agreement with the @xmath45 orbit than is the band 3 sheet of the fully itinerant  model .",
    "it is on this basis that zwicknagl  @xcite claimed that the partially localized  model is superior .",
    "if the fully itinerant  band 3 surface is to be brought into agreement with the data it has to be increased in size : the angle dependence follows that of the data quite well , however .",
    "bands 3/z3 both have , as well as the large @xmath21-centred surfaces , smaller , roughly spherical sufaces of similar size , but located at different points of the brillouin zone : in the fully itinerant  model there are @xmath22-centred ellipsoids as shown in figure [ valence_fs](c ) . the partially localized  model in contrast has @xmath46-centred ellipsoids , but of almost exactly the same size .",
    "the branches which we have labelled @xmath47 in figures [ norman_angle ] and [ zwicknagl_angle ] _ could _ arise from either of these surfaces ( see the branches labelled k-3 and h - z3 in figures [ freqs_vs_fs ] and [ zwicknagl_freqs ] ) .",
    "this is a very weak oscillation in our data , not previously observed .",
    "one issue with an assignment to k-3 is that increasing the size of the band 3 @xmath21 surface as discussed in the previous paragraph would also cause the @xmath22-centred pockets to increase , as they are also electron - like .",
    "in fact , one problem with the fully itinerant   model is that to increase the size of the @xmath21 surface to agree with experiment , one has the danger that this surface merges with the @xmath22-centred ellipsoids . to correct for",
    "this would require a distortion in the dispersion of this band .",
    "note , however , that , as discussed below , these @xmath47 oscillations could also arise from the band 4 surface of the fully itinerant  model .    turning next to band 1/z1 ( the @xmath44 branch ) the partially localized  model gives the best prediction of the quantitative value of this frequency at the @xmath31-axis",
    ", however , only the fully itinerant  model correctly predicts : ( 1 ) that this oscillation spans the entire @xmath27@xmath31-plane , ( ii ) that it will be seen in the @xmath27@xmath8-plane , and ( iii ) that it will extend to the @xmath8-axis in both the @xmath27@xmath8- and the @xmath31@xmath8-planes .",
    "these discrepancies between the partially localized  model and the data were not addressed by zwicknagl @xcite , yet it categorically shows that the topology of the z1 surface is wrong : this surface is closed ( i.e.  it can not have arms extending to the zone boundary ) in contrast to figure [ zwicknagl_fs](a ) . yet , as noted above , open orbits are required in order to explain the angle dependence of the magnetoresistance . only by introducing an additional fermi surface with open orbits , and adjusting the z1 surface so that it is closed ,",
    "can the partially localized  model be brought into agreement with both the angle dependence of the @xmath44 oscillation and the angle dependence of the magnetoresistance .",
    "it is thus clear that not only is the z1 topology wrong , there is also a major missing fermi surface in the partially localized  model .",
    "band-2 of the fully itinerant  model has open orbits , as shown in figure [ valence_fs](b ) , that explain the angle dependence of the magnetoresistance .",
    "it was found in previous studies to provide a natural explanation of the @xmath48 and @xmath41 oscillations .",
    "however , these find alternative explanations in the partially localized  model : the @xmath49 oscillation follows the angle dependence of a non - central orbit on the z1 surface , as illustrated in figure [ zwicknagl_angle ] , while @xmath48 could be explained by either @xmath50-z5 or l - z1 . however , we believe that several of our new frequencies provide unambiguous evidence for the existence of the band 2 surface : the @xmath51 orbit finds a natural interpretation in the fully itinerant  model as the orbit encircling the waist of this surface when the field is parallel to @xmath25 ( this is the blue line in figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) , although the frequency is slightly larger than that predicted .",
    "this very clear frequency ( shown in figure [ dhva_nr_c ] ) has not been previously reported .",
    "we found that it has a high mass : @xmath52 .",
    "we note that kimura  @xcite also believed that they had found this orbit , which they called @xmath53 , but it was at a lower frequency , and we did not observe this signal at all .",
    "we believe that our @xmath51 frequency is in better agreement with the overall size of the band 2 surface .",
    "we note additionally that the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath36 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 frequencies are only explainable via the topologically complicated orbits on the band 2 surface , and not within the partially localized   model , as shown in figure [ norman_explained ] .",
    "this is discussed further in the appendix , but we draw attention particularly to the @xmath54 orbit , a strong , high frequency oscillation in the basal plane , that corresponds well to non - central orbits that span two brillouin zones , as illustrated in figure [ band2_extended ] .",
    "final , circumstantial evidence in favour of the existence of the band 2 surface is that it makes a major ( roughly 30% ) contribution to the linear coefficient of specific heat , and if it does not exist then the linear coefficient of the specific heat is no longer explained by the quasiparticle masses .",
    "it thus seems very likely that it is this fermi surface which is missing from the partially localized  model .",
    "the @xmath58 orbit has previously been assigned to band 4 in the fully itinerant  model , i.e.   @xmath21 - 4 @xcite , but it was not clear why this oscillation was only seen near the basal plane when it should be seen at all angles .",
    "a second possible interpretation of our @xmath59 oscillation is that it is the extension of this oscillation , but if this is true then the @xmath60-centred orbits of band 3 either do not exist , or their oscillations are even weaker than these signals .    finally , turning to band 5 , one of the mysteries of previous studies is why this small electron sheet , with orbit @xmath21 - 5 , does not show up more clearly .",
    "taillefer and lonzarich @xcite assigned it to a frequency of about 0.7 kt near the @xmath27-axis with the field in the basal plane .",
    "we see a corresponding frequency extending toward the @xmath8-axis in the @xmath27@xmath8-plane , within about 30@xmath24 of the basal plane , but the signal then disappears abruptly , which is not easily explained for a simple spherical surface .",
    "a new candidate for this surface is , however , the strong low - frequency signal seen in the magnetoresistance ( the most visible oscillation in figure [ qm_osc_r ] ) , with a frequency between 0.1 and 0.2 kt , labelled @xmath61 in figure [ norman_angle ] .",
    "although it is very strong in the magnetoresistance , it has not been previously reported , presumably because low frequencies are much harder to see in dhva .",
    "we believe that the surface which gives rise to this oscillation is roughly spherical , because we were eventually able to follow it in dhva measurements toward the @xmath8-axis in the @xmath31@xmath8-plane , although we did not observe it along the @xmath8-axis , nor in the @xmath27@xmath8-plane .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation in the magnetoresistance is really huge ( see figure [ qm_osc_r ] ) , given the small size of the fermi surface , and it is also strongly angle - dependent the signal is strongest when the field is in the basal plane about 10@xmath24 from @xmath31 : in this angular region , the non - oscillatory magnetoresistance has a shoulder ( see figure [ r_vs_b_and_theta ] ) .",
    "we have no explanation of the strength of this sdh oscillation ; sometimes magnetoresistance oscillations from small surfaces can be strong if the surface acts as an interferometer for larger fermi surfaces @xcite , but we do not have a model for such an interferometer in the fermi surface shown in figure [ valence_fs ] . if indeed these oscillations arise from @xmath21 - 5 , then the surface in the fully itinerant  calculation is too large .",
    "the quasiparticle mass on this surface was measured to be 16 @xmath62 3 @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we note that the original fully itinerant  model , while generally in much better agreement with the data , still has quantitative discrepancies with the data that are at least as striking as those that have recently aroused interest in sodium cobaltate @xcite .",
    "although it seems unlikely that better fermi surface measurements will soon be on the horizon for upt@xmath0 , it may be that the present data set is sufficiently detailed that it could be used as the basis for improving electronic structure methods for f - electron systems .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting if the fermi surface of upt@xmath0 could be calculated from dynamical mean field theory , as this technique has shown recent promise in other actinide materials such as plutonium @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface of upt@xmath0 has over the past two decades been experimentally determined to a high degree of accuracy , allowing comparison with the results of electronic structure calculations at both coarse and fine levels of detail .",
    "our new results fill some gaps in earlier data , and serve to emphasize the rather large number of fermi surfaces of the heavy fermion state of upt@xmath0 , and the topological complexity of some of the surfaces .",
    "we find that the partially localized  model , which assumes that two 5f - electrons per uranium atom are localized , shows unacceptably large discrepancies with observations .",
    "although it gives good agreement with the large electron sheet , and some other oscillations , it has grave difficulty in explaining many of the observed oscillations . at the crudest level",
    ", there are a lot more oscillations present than can be supported on the partially localized  fermi surface . at a deeper level , the topology for the band z1 surface does not agree at all well with the dhva data , and",
    "if it is modified to agree , then one can no longer explain the angle dependence of the magnetoresistance .",
    "it is clear that a major , experimentally observed , sheet of the fermi surface is missing from the partially localized  model .",
    "we have argued that the band 2 fermi surface of the fully itinerant  model must be close to the shape of this ` missing ' fermi surface , and thus that the fully itinerant  model of the fermi surface provides a much better explanation of the data : thus we conclude that , on the basis of existing band - structure calculations , the experimental evidence very strongly favours the model in which all three of the uranium f - electrons are delocalized in upt@xmath0 .",
    "this work has been supported by the us doe , office of science , under contract no .",
    "de - ac02 - 06ch11357 , the natural science and engineering research council of canada , the canadian institute for advanced research , and the engineering and physical science research council of the uk .",
    "12.0 cm    14.0 cm    in this paper , a number of new quantum oscillation orbits are described , but we did not assign them to specific predicted orbits in the fully itinerant  model because the case for preferring that model to the partially localized  model can be made without resorting details . nevertheless , it is possible to explain our new orbits using the band 2 surface ( with the exception of @xmath61 , which we have ascribed to the @xmath21 - 5 orbit ) .",
    "figure [ norman_explained ] shows the angle dependence of dhva frequencies for the band 2 surface ( solid lines ) from the fully itinerant  model compared with observed oscillation frequencies that we have ascribed to this surface .",
    "recall that our two labelling systems are : for the theoretical prediction , letters and numbers identify the centre of the orbit in @xmath17-space and the band on which the orbit exists ; for the experimental observation we use lowercase greek letters .",
    "the following assignments had been made previously : @xmath64 is assigned to a-2 , the orbit that circles the body of band 2 ( red line in figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) ; @xmath65 is assigned to ml-2 , the orbit that encircles one arm of band 2 ( turquoise line in figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) @xcite .    our best assignment of the ` new ' orbits is : @xmath56 and @xmath37 correspond to the two ah-2 orbits , which both circle four arms but at different distances out from the centre of the surface ( purple line in figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) ; @xmath54 seems to agree well with l-2 , which is the red orbit in figure [ band2_extended ] which spans two zones , however , this orbit is only marginally extremal , so it might be better to ascribe this frequency to the larger , but more stable , orbit shown by the blue line on figure [ band2_extended ] ",
    "this orbit is also labelled l-2 and it too spans two brillouin zones ; @xmath66 corresponds well to kh-2 , while @xmath67 corresponds ( not quite so well ) to alm-2 , both of which circle three upper arms and one lower arm when the field is at a rather high angle going towards @xmath8 ( these orbits are not shown on figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) ; @xmath39 corresponds well to akh-2 , the orbit that circles two arms ( yellow line on figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) ; @xmath68 corresponds well to kh-2 , which is an electron orbit that runs around the interior of the arms of three adjacent brillouin zones ( white line in figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) ; and we believe that @xmath42 is , as discussed in the text , the central orbit that runs around the waist of band 2 ( blue line in figure [ valence_fs](b ) ) .",
    "the comparison between the newly observed orbits and the predictions for this surface is , we believe , very convincing , keeping in mind that there were some limitations to our experiment : our dhva signals were comparatively weak near the @xmath27@xmath31-plane because of the orientation of the crystal in the pickup coils .",
    "thus , the failure to see the ah-2 and the ahk-2 orbits near the @xmath69-axis in the @xmath27@xmath8-plane is understandable , if unfortunate .",
    "moreover , the quantum oscillatory magnetoresistance , which gave rise to the oscillations between 3.0 and 4.0 kt in the @xmath27@xmath31-plane , lost intensity near the @xmath70-axis due to the near - vanishing of the magnetoresistance there ; hence these oscillations could not be followed to the @xmath70-axis in the @xmath27@xmath31-plane either .",
    "thus , the best regions for comparison are close to the @xmath8-axis in the @xmath27@xmath8- and @xmath31@xmath8-planes , and at intermediate angles in the @xmath27@xmath31-plane , and this is precisely where we find many oscillations that are only explainable by band 2 of the fully itinerant  model ."
