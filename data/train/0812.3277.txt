    "the  @xcite observations of more than 200 gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their follow - ups have been a revolution in our knowledge and understanding of these elusive phenomena . the rapid slew of the x - ray and uv / optical telescopes - respectively xrt  @xcite and uvot  @xcite - as well as ground based robotic telescopes have permitted to observe grbs and their afterglow in multi - wavelength from few tens of seconds after the prompt or precursor gamma - ray emission is detected by bat  @xcite , up to days after trigger .",
    "these observations show that the emission can be essentially divided to three regimes : 1 ) the prompt gamma - ray emission which can be very short , few tenth of milliseconds , or long , up to few hundred of seconds ; 2 ) a tail emission in x - ray which is observed for more than @xmath0 of bursts . for some bursts this tail",
    "is also detected as a soft faint continuum in gamma - ray . in about @xmath1 of bursts",
    "this early emission has been detected in optical and infrared too . in this regime for many bursts flares have been observed mainly in x - ray .",
    "sometimes the counterpart of flares have been also observed in gamma - ray and/or optical / ir . in many bursts",
    "the early steep slope of the x - ray emission at the beginning of this regime becomes much shallower and somehow harder at the end ; 3 ) the late emission can be considered as the epoch after the break of shallow regime in which the emission is usually a continuum and no or little flaring activity is observed ( but there are exceptions such as grb 070110  @xcite and grb 081028  @xcite which had bright late flares ) .",
    "the duration and relative fluxes of these regimes can vary significantly between grbs .",
    "in one hand , it seems that the idea of synchrotron emission from accelerated particles in a relativistic shock as the origin of the prompt emission  @xcite is essentially correct . on the other hand , the early observations of what is usually called _ the afterglow _ - the emission in lower energy bands usually observed from @xmath2  sec after trigger onward - have been the source of surprises and raised a number of questions about many issues : the activity  @xcite and the nature of the engine  @xcite , the concept of prompt / internal - afterglow / external shocks  @xcite , the efficiency of energy transfer from the outflow -_the fireball _ - to synchrotron radiation  @xcite , the collimation and jet break  @xcite , the behaviour of x - ray and optical light curves  @xcite , etc .",
    "many of predictions such as the existence of a significant high latitude emission with a strict relation between the light curve time evolution slope and the spectrum index , and an achromatic jet break have not been observed .",
    "moreover , the origin of unexpected behaviours such as a very steep decline in low energy bands after the prompt  @xcite and a very shallow regime which lasts for thousands of seconds are not well understood .",
    "other unexpected observations are the existence of the chromatic multiple breaks in the x - ray light curves , flares in x - ray and optical bands hundred of seconds after the prompt even in some short bursts ( ex : grb 060313  @xcite , grb 070724a  @xcite , a tail emission in short bursts ( ex : grb070714b  @xcite , grb080426  @xcite , grb 080503  @xcite ) , and very short , hard , and high amplitude spikes in long bursts that could lead to the classification of the burst as short if the instrument was not enough sensitive to detect the rest of the prompt emission ( ex : grb060614  @xcite , grb061006  @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the classification of bursts as short and long much more ambiguous  @xcite .",
    "one conclusion that has been made from these observations is that the central engine can be active for up to thousands of seconds after the prompt emission  @xcite .",
    "but the nature of the fireball and its source of energy is not yet well understood , and we can not yet verify this interpretation or relate it to any specific process in the engine .",
    "it seems however that whatever the origin of the fireball , it must be baryon dominated otherwise it could not make long term effects correlated to the prompt emission . in this case , the internal and external shock models as the origin of the prompt and afterglow are good candidates .",
    "nonetheless , the lack of a simple explanation for the observed complexities has encouraged authors to consider other possibilities , for instance associating both the prompt gamma - ray and the afterglows to external shocks and fast variations to abrupt density variation of the surrounding material  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that in such models it is not possible to explain the fast variations of the prompt even in presence of a bubbly environment or pulse - like density change  @xcite .",
    "here we suggest that at least some of the features of early afterglows can be related to a complex shock physics and/or features in the fireball / jet .",
    "in fact , simulations of the acceleration of electrons and positrons by the first and second fermi processes show that the evolution of electric and magnetic fields as well as the energy distribution of accelerated particles are quite complex  @xcite .",
    "plasma instabilities lead to the formation of coherent electric and magnetic fields and acceleration of particles  @xcite .",
    "their time evolution in relativistic shocks can significantly affect the behaviour of the prompt and the afterglow of grbs .",
    "if the number density of particles in the ejecta is significant and the shock is collisional , the state of matter in the jet can be also an important factor in determining the behaviour of the fields , and thereby the synchrotron emission by accelerated electrons and positrons .",
    "many aspects of these processes are not well understood , however realistic interpretations of observations should consider these complexities at least phenomenologically .",
    "for instance , the simple distributions such as a power - law distribution for lorentz factor of electrons , or a constant magnetic field for the whole duration of prompt and afterglow can be quite unrealistic . ideally , these quantities should come from the simulation of fermi processes and plasma instabilities such as weibel instability  @xcite that produces the coherent transverse magnetic field .",
    "however , these phenomena are complex and their simulations are very time and cpu consuming . for these reasons they can not yet explore the parameter space of the phenomena and are mostly useful for demonstrating the concepts and how they work .",
    "therefore we are obliged to use simple analytical approximations for quantities related to the physics of relativistic shocks . in this situation",
    "a compromise between complex non - analytical expressions and too simplistic and too simplified but unrealistic analytical behaviour of the physical quantities can be the consideration of intervals in which a simple analytical function can be a good approximation .",
    "then , by adding together these intervals - regimes - one can reconstruct the entire evolution of a burst and its afterglow .    even with a simplified presentation of the physical processes one would not be able to explain grb data without a model including both microphysics and dynamics of the fireball . the majority of works on the modelling of shocks and synchrotron emissions either deal with the emission  @xcite or with the kinematics of the shock  @xcite , or both but in a phenomenological way  @xcite .",
    "few works  @xcite have tried to include both these aspects in a consistent model , but either they have not been very successful - their predictions specially for quantities such as lags in different bands were far from observed values and additional parametrization was necessary - or the formulation is too abstract to be compared directly with data  @xcite .    with these issues in mind , in sec.[sec : model ] we present a simplified shock model that includes both the kinematics of the ejecta and the dynamics of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the microphysics is included by the means of a simple parametrization .",
    "we calculate a number of observables such as flux , hardness ratios , and lags between different energy bands . in this paper and paper ii",
    "in which we simulate part of prompt and afterglow regimes of grbs in some time intervals , we show that this model can explain many aspects of bursts as long as we divide the data to separate regimes .",
    "the reason is that the simple parametrization of microphysics in this model can be valid at most in a limited time interval .",
    "each regime should be separately compared to analytical and numerical results for extracting the parameters .",
    "the results will show how parameters that are considered as constant in this model evolve during the lifetime of the burst .",
    "this is the best we can do until a better understanding of relativistic shock models and fermi processes become available .",
    "if the model and the estimation of its parameters for each regime is sufficiently correct , adding them together should give us an overall consistent picture of characteristics of the burst , its afterglow , and its surrounding material .",
    "apriori this knowledge should help to better understand the engine activities and eventually its nature and classification .",
    "the model presented here depends on a large number of parameters and we need an extraction procedure permitting to extract as much as possible information about the physical properties of the shock from the available data . in sec.[sec : extract ] we explain how in the frame work of this model one can extract various quantities from data .",
    "evidently the success of the modelling strongly depends on availability and quality of simultaneous multi - wavelength observations .",
    "the observations show that during the first few hundred seconds after the trigger there is usually a very close relation between the prompt gamma - ray emission and the emission in lower energy bands  @xcite , therefore , most probably they have a common origin , presumably internal shocks .",
    "however , historically and even in the present literature ( and sometimes believes ) any emission after the prompt gamma - ray is called _ the afterglow _ - meaning due to a shock with ism or surrounding material , presumably external shocks .",
    "therefore , for clarity of context here we define _ the afterglow _ as the emission in any energy band and at any time after the main prompt peaks regardless of its origin . if by _ afterglow _",
    "we mean the external shocks , this is mentioned explicitly in the text .",
    "we finish this paper with some outlines and two appendices containing the details of calculation of the dynamics and flux for power - law distribution of electrons lorentz factor .",
    "in this section we first give a sketch description of a relativistic collision between two shells of material and processes which produce gamma - ray and other radiations .",
    "then , we discuss a simplified mathematical formulation of the evolution of the shock and synchrotron emission . by restricting the model to a thin layer and to the early times after beginning of the collision",
    ", we can analytically calculate various observables .",
    "we begin this section by a pictorial description of present believes about the origin of grbs and their afterglow . a central source - supernova , collapsar , collision of two compact objects , etc .",
    "- ejects highly relativistic cold baryon dominated material as a spherical , jet or torus - like shells call _ the fireball_. collision between faster later ejected shells with slower earlier ejected ones produces what is called the prompt emission  @xcite .",
    "apriori , there is no reason why faster shells should be ejected later .",
    "one way of explaining this paradigm is the deceleration of the front shells  @xcite by surrounding material which are observed around massive objects such as wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this initial deceleration is the source of a weak emission which has been seen before the main spike in many bursts .",
    "a relatively weak and soft precursor spike has been also observed in some bursts and can be related to this deceleration  @xcite . although other origins such as jet - star interaction  @xcite and fallback to the collapsar  @xcite are also suggested to explain precursors , deceleration of the initial shell seems to be a more natural explanation and does not need any fine tuning of the progenitor models and their parameters .",
    "in contrast , jet - star interaction scenario can not explain large time lag - few 100 of seconds between precursor and the main spike in some bursts e.g. grb 050820a  @xcite , grb 060124  @xcite , and grb 070721b  @xcite .",
    "in the fallback scenario a weak jet is produced during the formation of a transient neutron star which later collapses to a black hole .",
    "the main jet in this scenario is produced by the accretion of the material from a disk to the black hole . in this case , the lag depends on the lifetime of the proto - neutron star and the rate of the accretion from the surrounding disk .",
    "although these parameters can be tuned to explain the lag , apriori much longer lags should be also possible but never observed . in the deceleration scenario",
    "the maximum possible lag is the duration of the central engine main activity - few hundred of seconds according to the observations of the main flares in x - ray , and is consistent with all the observations .",
    "the uv emission from the precursor should ionize the unshocked material in front of the first shell and therefore there would be little additional absorption of soft x - ray later  @xcite .",
    "in fact in grb 060124  @xcite which had long lag between the precursor and the main peak , a slight increase in @xmath3 column density at late time with respect to the initial density has been detected . in paper",
    "ii we argue that another possible origin of the precursor is the temporary dynamical reduction of the emission in the early stage of the shock that make the burst unobservable for a short time .",
    "then , with the progress of coalescence of the shells the emission resumes and is observed as the main peak .    when two high density shells collide , in the most general case they partially coalesce .",
    "then , the most energetic particles get ahead of the rest in the downstream , and at the end of the collision the configuration includes again two shells .",
    "the back shell consists of slower particles that have lost their kinetic energy ( shocked particles ) .",
    "the front shell is the remnant of faster unscattered particles in the shells . in practice",
    "we expect that the kinetic energy difference be continuous and slower particles become an expanding tail behind a faster and most probably denser head . in few bursts such as grb060607a  @xcite and grb 070107",
    "@xcite it seems that we are seeing the separation between these components in the x - ray afterglow .",
    "fig.[fig : shochcaricature ] shows a sketch of the shock processes .    in the simplest case",
    "the shock between two shells is radiative .",
    "this means that for an observer in the rest frame of the fast shell the kinetic energy of the falling particles from the other shell is immediately radiated and particles come to rest and join the shell . for a far observer at rest with respect to the engine the difference between the kinetic energy of the two shells",
    "is partially radiated and partially transferred to the particles of the slower shell .",
    "the fast shell is decelerated until the totality of the slow shell is swept .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     not all the particles in the fast shell are decelerated with the same rate .",
    "therefore after the coalescence of the shells there is a gradient of lorentz factor from the shell front head with highest @xmath4 to the back tail with lowest @xmath4 . in the macroscopic treatment of the shock",
    "processes it is usually assumed that during the collision two distinguishable shocked layers and corresponding discontinuities are formed in each side of the boundary between the shells .",
    "they are called forward and reverse shocks according to their evolution direction with respect to the initial discontinuity  @xcite . according to these models and depending on the density difference of the shells and their relative lorentz factor , the induced electric and magnetic fields and thereby",
    "the distribution of accelerated electrons and their synchrotron emission in these shocked regions can be very different .",
    "notably the reveres shock is expected to emit mostly in optical wavelength with a relatively large lag with respect to the prompt gamma - ray as the emission must traverse the width of both shocked layers .",
    "therefore it should appear as an optical flash asynchronous from gamma - ray peaks  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if shells have similar densities and a small relative lorentz factor , the scattering of particles in the two sides of the boundary quickly homogenizes the shocked regions , and therefore one can consider a single shocked zone with a relatively slow gradient in density and fields . if one of the shells has a density much larger than the other , the width of its shocked layer would be very small with respect to the shocked region in the other shell and again the assumption of a single shocked layer is a good approximation for internal shocks .",
    "this schematic view corresponds well to what is observed in the simulations of fermi acceleration in the ultra - relativistic shocks ( see fig.1 of  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    for a far observer who only detects photons from the synchrotron emission of the shocked material it is very difficult to distinguish between photons coming from distinct regions unless they are well separated in time and in energy band .",
    "the lack of a clear evidence for a reverse shock emission in the bursts , specially during the prompt emission , means that the reverse shock in the prompt grb emission is weak and the assumption of just one shocked region is a good approximation .",
    "most of the synchrotron emission is expected to be emitted by charged particles in the shocked region .",
    "but as electric and magnetic fields , and accelerated particles are not really confined in this region and penetrate to a larger area , the region that emit radiation can be much extended than shocked region .",
    "we call this emitting zone _ the active region_.    evidently , in a real situation multiple shells are ejected in a short time interval . in this case both pair collisions between late shells and collision - coalescence of the late shells with the main ejecta - _ prompt shell _ - is possible .",
    "these events happen at different points of space - time , but their synchrotron emission can arrive to the observer separately , partially overlapping , or simultaneously .",
    "therefore it is not always possible to distinguish separate collisions and their characteristics . to this complexity",
    "one must also add the variation of quantities such as density and lorentz factor in a single shell .",
    "they increase the variability of observed emissions . on the other hand ,",
    "overlapping emissions make the comparison of data with the models based on a simple parametrization of the physical properties of a shell ambiguous . despite these complexities",
    "one should be able to consider peaks as separate collisions and find an _ effective _ set of parameters to model each one separately .",
    "a shock is defined mathematically as a discontinuity in the density distribution of a flow .",
    "it should satisfy at each point of the space - time the total energy - momentum and current / particle flux conservation equation  @xcite : t^ _ ; & = & 0 [ enermom ] + _",
    "i ( _ i u_i^ ) _ ; & = & 0 [ current ] where @xmath5 is the total energy - momentum tensor ; @xmath6 is density and @xmath7 velocity vector ; the index @xmath8 indicates species of particles / fluids with a conserved number .",
    "they also include the interactions between these particles / fluids .",
    "when there is no interaction , these equations must be satisfied separately for each species . in particular , at the shock front where these quantities are discontinuous the conservation equations take the form of jump conditions across the discontinuity surface :  _ & = & 0 [ jumpener ] _ i [ _ i u_i^ ]  _ & = & 0 [ jumpcurrent ] the symbol @xmath9 $ ] means the difference of the quantities between square brackets on the two sides of the shock front . solutions of these equations determine the evolution of the shock front . as for the state of the shocked material behind the discontinuity , when there is no energy dissipation jump conditions can be used to obtain a self - similar solution  @xcite . in presence of energy injection or dissipation",
    "however the self similarity solutions are only approximations and in general an exact self similar solution does not exist .",
    "moreover , energy dissipation by synchrotron emission changes the form of the conservation equations , i.e. it can not be treated as an inhomogeneous term in the differential equations describing the dynamics .",
    "thus , it is not possible to extend the solutions of the non - dissipative case to this case even as an approximation .",
    "we will discuss this issue in details later in this section .",
    "therefore in a dissipative shock the jump conditions are applied only at the initial time when a shell meets another shell or the ism , and they should be considered as boundary conditions when conservation equations ( [ enermom ] ) and ( [ current ] ) are solved .    intuitively we expect that with time the discontinuous distributions of quantities in the shock front i.e the initial jump conditions change to continuous distributions which at far downstream distances should asymptotically approach to the slow shell values , and at far distances in the upstream direction to the characteristics of the fast shell - see fig.[fig : shochcaricature ] for a schematic illustration . in this",
    "transient region instabilities form electric and transversal magnetic fields .",
    "they accelerates electrons which subsequently lose their energy by synchrotron and inverse compton emission .",
    "a far observer receives the signature of the shock mainly through the detection of these radiations as @xmath10-ray burst or x - ray flare . therefore finding the evolution of physics of this region is the main purpose for solving conservation equations .    a full solution of equations ( [ enermom ] ) and ( [ current ] ) with the initial conditions ( [ jumpener ] ) and ( [ jumpcurrent ] ) apriori include all the necessary information about the physical processes and their evolution .",
    "however , the complexity of the problem can not permit to solve them analytically .",
    "on the other hand , numerical simulations are both complex and time consuming , and it would be very difficult to cover the full parameter space and obtain results that can be compared with the observations . at present , simulations are only able to demonstrate the validity of ideas about processes involved and the role of the instabilities in the formation of coherent fields  @xcite .    here",
    "we consider an intermediate strategy .",
    "we assume a spherical ] thin and optically transparent active region .",
    "its average distance from the central source is @xmath11 and its thickness @xmath12 .",
    "we neglect the variation of quantities inside the active region and consider the average value through the region .",
    "this means that the evolution depends only on @xmath11 the mean distance of the active region from central engine .",
    "as for the energy dissipation , we assume a radiative shock i.e. for an observer at rest with respect to the active region the incoming particles lose their energy through synchrotron radiation and join this region . despite possibility of large contribution from compton cooling of electrons in the grbs prompt  @xcite , x - ray flares  @xcite , and afterglow  @xcite , there is no strong evidence of this process in the data .",
    "cases such as the early flare of grb 050406  @xcite that was once attributed to compton cooling of a reverse shock is now understood to be related to the late activity of the central engine like all other observed flares and have the same origin as the gamma - ray .",
    "it is also suggested that the anomalous behaviour of grb 060218/sn 2006aj  @xcite is due to inverse compton cooling  @xcite , but this is an exception .",
    "therefore here we only consider synchrotron radiation in a relativistic shock as the source of emission .    from now on",
    "we consider the active region as an isolated shell of baryonic material .",
    "the effect of ism / slow shell appears as an incoming flux , and the effect of diffusion of shocked material into the upstream is included in the evolution of the thickness of the active region and other physical parameters such as density variation with time .",
    "the initial value of the density and lorentz factor correspond to the values in the fast shell i.e. the shock front at the time of encounter between the two shells ( internal shock ) or fast shell and the ism ( external shock ) .",
    "we also assume that thermal energy and pressure are negligible with respect to the relativistic boost .",
    "this assumption of cold matter is specially justified for the prompt emission because the temperature of ejected material from the progenitor is expected to be at most a few hundred mev , where the kinetic energy of relativistic baryons must be of order of few gev or larger .",
    "this approximation is not probably suitable for late interaction of the shells when they have lost most of their kinetic energy and probably turbulence and scattering have transferred part of this energy to thermal .    with these approximations",
    "we write the energy - momentum conservation equations for the active region in the rest frame of the slow shell .",
    "the reason for choosing this frame is that the same formulation can be applied to external shocks where the slow shell is the ism or surrounding material around the engine .",
    "the latter is considered to be at rest with respect to the observer ( after correction for the expansion of the universe ) .",
    "note that for the consistency and conservation of energy and momentum we have to integrate equations ( [ enermom ] ) and ( [ current ] ) along the active region . as we only consider the average value of quantities , the integration is trivial : & & =  ( r^2 + 2r ( nr ) ) + + & & r^2 ( nr ) = n_0(r ) r^2 - [ enercons ] + & & =  ",
    "( r^2 + 2r ( nr ) ) + + & & r^2 ( nr ) = - [ momcons ] where @xmath13 is the distance from the central engine , @xmath14 is the baryon number density of the fast shell measured in the slow shell frame , @xmath15 is the baryon number density of the slow shell in its rest frame and in general it can depend on @xmath13 . here",
    "we assume that @xmath16 . for ism @xmath17 , i.e. no radial dependence . for a wind surrounding the central engine @xmath18",
    "is usually assumed  @xcite .",
    "for a thin shell or jet expanding adiabatically also @xmath18 if we neglect the transverse expansion in the case of a jet ( collimated ejecta ) . but for the collision between two thin shells if the duration of the collision is much smaller than @xmath19 we can neglect the density change due to expansion during the collision , and assume @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath20 is the thickness of the shocked synchrotron emitting region , @xmath21 is the lorentz factor of the fast shell with respect to the slow shell , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the total emitted energy , and @xmath25 is the speed of light .",
    "the evolution of the radius with time is : r ( t ) - r ( t_0 ) = c _ t_0^t  ( t  ) dt  [ revol ] where the initial time @xmath26 is considered to be the beginning of the collision .",
    "apriori we should also consider a conservation equation for the baryon and lepton numbers",
    ". however , with approximations explained above the thickness of the active region is a parameter which is added by hand .",
    "the simplest assumption is that the active region is formed only from particles that fall from the slow shell to the shock front and they stay there . in this case",
    "the baryon number conservation is simply : = n_0 [ numcon ] on the other hand the assumption of particles staying for ever in the active region seems quite unphysical because scattering , acceleration , and dissipation move shocked particles to both upstream and down stream and gradually many of particles are in a region where instabilities are too weak to make the electric and magnetic fields necessary for the acceleration and synchrotron emission .",
    "therefore in this approximation the active region can not be considered as an completely isolated system with full conservation laws applied to it .",
    "the consequence of this is that we can not determine @xmath27 from first principles .",
    "this point can be also interpreted as the manifestation of the fact that there is not an abrupt termination of the active zone , and therefore there is no conservation for the artificial boundary we have added by hand .",
    "in fact it is equally valid if we consider a conserved number of particles and the corresponding conservation equation but give up energy or momentum conservation . in this definition",
    "the active region follows _ active particles _ ( in an hamiltonian formulation sense ) .",
    "however , the only measurable quantity for a far observer is the energy dissipated as radiation .",
    "therefore , it is more useful to define the active region based on the energy - momentum conservation and leave the number of these particles as a free parameter .",
    "note also that in the left hand side of ( [ enercons ] ) and ( [ momcons ] ) , as well as in the synchrotron term under some conditions ( see below ) , @xmath20 always appears as @xmath28 i.e. the column density .",
    "it is more relevant for the observations and does not depend on the way we define the active region .",
    "we can formally integrate equation ( [ enercons ] ) by replacing the synchrotron term in the left hand side of ( [ momcons ] ) , and determine the column density of the active region : & & n r = + & & + [ columndenssol ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the corresponding @xmath31 .",
    "this solution depends on the evolution of @xmath21 which can be obtained by solving ( [ momcons ] ) , but we first remind the dependence of the synchrotron term on the microphysics of the shock .",

    "/ relativistic shock literature it is usually assumed that @xmath39 , i.e. only falling leptons are accelerated .",
    "however , the validity of this assumption is not certain because once the electric and magnetic fields are produced by the instabilities , all the charged leptons are accelerated .",
    "if the initial number density of charged leptons in the rest frame of the shells is similar to the slow shell , then as the flux of falling leptons is enhanced by a factor of @xmath21 , the density of local leptons can be neglected . however , in prompt collision one expects that the relative lorentz factor of the shells be @xmath40 . in this case",

    "analytical approximations of these integrals can be found in appendix [ app : a ] .    in the last paragraph we considered power - law dependence on @xmath13 for the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the case of an exponential rise or fall of the fields is important at the beginning and at the end of gamma - ray spikes or early x - ray flares . for this case ,",
    "the only modification in ( [ integdyn ] ) and ( [ integsteady ] ) is the replacement of @xmath107 with @xmath108 where here @xmath109 is a dimensionless coefficient determining the speed of exponential variation .",

    "the kinetic energy of the shock is much larger than radiation and therefore the synchrotron emission does not significantly modify the evolution of the shock .",
    "note also that although @xmath119 is linearly proportional to the synchrotron total coupling @xmath75 , it depends non - linearly on @xmath88 through a power which depends on the time / radius variation of the electric and magnetic fields as well as the density of the shells .",
    "the quantity @xmath119 in this model depends also on @xmath120 : larger @xmath120 , larger the influence of radiation .",

    "for instance , for a slow shell with a roughly constant density @xmath131 .",
    "therefore @xmath109 depends only on the behaviour of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "if the variation index of the these fields are small and positive , the value of @xmath129 can be small , i.e. the radiation will not vary very quickly .",
    "by contrast , a negative index - increasing fields - can not last for long time and imposes a large value for @xmath129 .",
    "this simple argument shows that there is an intrinsic relation between these parameters .",
    "however , only a detailed modelling of the microphysics of the shock will be able to determine possible relations and their physical origin .",
    "nonetheless the discussion above shows that the simple model studied here is consistent and includes some of the important properties of the phenomena involved in the production of grbs .    using ( [ betan ] )",
    "one can see that a constant @xmath103 is equivalent to redefinition of @xmath88 .",
    "therefore when the radiation term arrives to its maximum , @xmath31 evolution becomes like a non - radiating ejecta .    in the case of a quasi - steady active region ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath103 is essentially similar because of similarity between two models explained above .",
    "however , the time scales and indexes are different .",
    "for instance , when @xmath113 the value of @xmath103 is proportional to @xmath132 with a coefficient equal to ( [ largeetaeps ] ) or ( [ smalletaeps ] ) and @xmath133 , minus the same term with @xmath106 . in this case , the initial @xmath120 does not have an explicit contribution and the slope of @xmath103 is smaller than dynamical model . for @xmath121",
    "if other parameters are the same as dynamical model , the absence of @xmath120 and smaller power of @xmath134 means that @xmath103 approaches its maximum value slower .",
    "there is also a slower change when one of the two contributor terms becomes too small and negligible .",
    "as expected , all these properties make this model more suitable for modelling the afterglow .    up to now",
    "we have only discussed the solutions of dynamical equation ( [ gammaevol ] ) corresponding to the rise of the synchrotron emission .",
    "the falling edge of the emission i.e. when @xmath135 can be obtained simply be time / radius reversal of rising solutions , see eq .",
    "( [ drquasiend ] ) .",
    "for instance in ( [ largeetaeps ] ) and ( [ smalletaeps ] ) if @xmath136 , @xmath137 . by moving the initial condition from @xmath138 to @xmath13 , we obtain a positive but decreasing value for @xmath139 which becomes zero at @xmath140 .",
    "these approximations however do not permit to determine when the radiation begins to decrease .",
    "for this we need a detailed study of the evolution of fields and other shock properties .    in summary ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath31 determines the kinematic of the burst and is important for the estimation of all observables such as what we will discuss in the next sections - synchrotron flux , hardness ratios , etc .",
    "@xmath31 is also important for determining the evolution of other parameters that are not directly observable and a model must be used for their extraction from data .",
    "a good example is the time variation of @xmath141 the minimum characteristic frequency of the synchrotron emission .",
    "it determines the behaviour of the spectrum and light curves ( see expression ( [ omegamdef ] ) below for its definition ) . assuming the simplest case of @xmath142 in ( [ gammam ] ) , from the definition of @xmath141 one can see that @xmath143 .",
    "the proportionality coefficient is time / radius independent .      in this section",
    "we first remind the synchrotron emission for the purpose of completeness and then we use the results for determination of lags between the light curves of different energy bands .    the ejecta from a central engine that produces the gamma - ray burst is most probably collimated and jet - like , otherwise the observed energy is not explainable .",
    "on the other hand for the far observers , even a spherical relativistic emission looks collimated to an angle @xmath144 along the line of sight where @xmath4 is the lorentz factor of the emitting matter in the observer rest frame  @xcite .",
    "therefore in any case we need to consider the angular dependence of the synchrotron emission .",
    "moreover , we need to consider the delay as well as angular dependence of the doppler shift of the emission .",
    "simulations show that even with an angular independent emission , these effects can apriori explain the lag between different bands observed in both batse and bursts  @xcite . however , in these simulations the spectrum and the time profile of emission have been put by hand .",
    "there are a number of evidence against a high latitude / doppler effect origin of the observed lags .",
    "first of all the total effect of high latitude emission decreases when lorentz factor is very high .",
    "it is expected that in grbs @xmath145 , and therefore this effect should be very small .",
    "in addition , even in the early x - ray emission where it was expected that this effect dominates , it has not been observed . on the other hand , for a given category of bursts ,",
    "short or long , it does not seem that there is any relation between lags and spectrum as expected from a doppler effect .",
    "therefore we conclude that the contribution of high latitude emission and doppler effect is sub - dominant and can not explain the observations . on the other hand , we show that even with neglecting the high latitude emission , due to the evolution of physical properties a lag between different energy bands exists .    in the model presented here the synchrotron emitting matter is confined to the active region .",
    "therefore we identify the bulk lorentz factor @xmath4 with respect to the observer with the average lorentz factor of the active region with respect to the observer .",
    "it can be related to the relative lorentz factor @xmath64 obtained in sec .",

    "the variation of @xmath198 is also possible if the magnetic field changes with time . if fields are considered to be constant during the emission - as it is the case for many grb models in the literature - only dynamical friction and decrease in @xmath10 remain",

    "this is orders of magnitude larger than what is expected from internal shocks . as synchrotron emission is highly angular dependent ,",
    "lags are expected not only from doppler and high latitude correction but also when these effects are ignored .",

    "observations show that in most long busts there is a significant lag - from tens to few hundreds of milliseconds between soft and hard bands .",
    "by contrast , in short bursts the lags is very small and within the present sensitivity and time resolution of gamma - ray telescopes it is consistent with zero or at most a few milliseconds .",
    "these two classes are respectively associated with the explosion of massive stars ( collapsars , hypernova ) and to the merging of two compact objects - a neutron star with a black hole , two neutron stars , or a neutron star and a white dwarf .",

    "moreover , some bursts that according to their @xmath208 can be classified as short such as grb 080426  @xcite have relatively long lags of few tens of milliseconds . on the other hand some apparently long bursts such as grb 060614  @xcite and grb 080503  @xcite have small lags similar to the short bursts .",
    "various explanation have been put forward for these _ out of norm _ behaviours : sensitivity of detractors only to the peak of a long burst leading to its misclassification as short , existence of a separate class of grbs with intermediate durations and lags , long tail emission in otherwise short burst for bursts with long @xmath208 and small lags .",
    "some authors even rule out the association of long grbs - hypernova , short grbs - collision of compact objects , and suggest that they should be classified according to their lags : short lags old population , long lags young population  @xcite .",
    "apart from classification of progenitors of the grbs , lags along with luminosity have been also used as proxy for the grbs redshift determination  @xcite .    in summary , lags seem to be important quantities related to the nature of central engine of the grbs , properties of the ejecta , and the surrounding material .",
    "they can be relatively easily measured , and therefore it is important to be able to relate them to these phenomena . some authors have tried to explain lags just as a geometrical effect related to the high latitude emission and associated doppler shift  @xcite . as we have discussed in the previous section and also regarding @xmath91 and @xmath185 dependence of the spectrum in ( [ powerdopcorr ] ) , it is evident that even without doppler shift and high latitude corrections the @xmath91 dependence - equivalent to time dependence in the model discussed here - and @xmath185 dependence are not factorisable , and therefore light curves in different energy band can not be the same even when they are normalized to smear the amplitude difference .    to define and determine lags we need fast varying features such as peaks .",
    "in the gamma - ray bursts light curves peaks are mostly observed in the prompt gamma - ray energy bands .",
    "nonetheless , fast slew of the satellite and some of the ground based robotic telescopes have permitted to observe the counterpart peaks or at least evidence of their presence in x - ray and optical bands . a realistic model for",
    "the lags should be able to predict the lag in all these energy bands if they have the same origin .",
    "on the other hand , a deviation of some bands from predictions can be used as an evidence for a different origin of the corresponding feature .",
    "the nature of peaks and their profile are not well understood . in the framework of the synchrotron emission from internal shock model as the origin of the prompt gamma - ray emission ,",
    "the rising side of a peak indicates the beginning of the collision between shells and formation of the electric and magnetic fields that leads to the acceleration of charged particles and synchrotron emission in the induced magnetic field .",
    "decreasing edge corresponds to the separation and/or the total coalescence of the shells .",
    "however , it is expected that even before separation / coalescence , microphysics in the active region arrive to a roughly steady state during which only slight changes due to e.g. density fluctuation in the shells will occur . in particular",
    "when the initial evolution of the microphysics is much faster than the time of the passage of the shells through each other we expect that for a limited duration the active region has quasi steady characteristics .",
    "assuming such a case - in accordance with the discussion about the evolution of @xmath27 in sec .",
    "[ sec : shockevol ] - a peak corresponds to : ( ) = c ( r ) ( ) = 0 [ peakdef ] the lag for a given peak corresponds to the difference between peak time / radius for two frequencies or two energy bands .",

    "the ejecta should be highly relativistic with a bulk lorentz factor of order of few hundreds .",
    "this leads to a strong apparent collimation of the radiation from a spherically symmetric ejecta to angles @xmath224 for a far observer  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the ejecta is not intrinsically spherical but jet like  @xcite . in this case after deceleration of the fireball during its propagation through the surrounding material or the ism , at some radius / time @xmath225 and radiation is no longer collimated .",
    "this lead to a drop of observed flux  @xcite . as this effect is purely kinematic / geometric it should not depend on energy .",
    "observations of the and robotic ground telescopes however contradict this expectation .",
    "the breaks seen in the afterglow light curves are usually chromatic . in many bursts no optical break has been observed up to millions of seconds after the prompt emission  @xcite . in some bursts , mostly bright ones but",
    "not always , no break has been observed in x - ray either  @xcite . in a significant fraction of bursts multiple breaks in the x - ray light curve have been observed .",
    "apriori only one of these breaks ( if any ) can be due to the jet break .",
    "therefore , the mechanism of break is more complex than just a kinematical effect .",
    "here we want to argue that even in the simple case of the opening due to deceleration , we should not expect to have an achromatic break if the afterglow is a synchrotron radiation .    for obtaining the analytical expression ( [ powerdopcorr ] ) for the radiation spectrum , we made the simplifying approximation that @xmath226 ) . without this approximation ( [ totpowinter ] )",
    "depends on the opening angle .",
    "the justification for this approximation was that the synchrotron emission is highly directional and for @xmath227 the intensity reduces exponentially because the value of @xmath202 in the integrand of ( [ totpowinter ] ) grows .",
    "@xmath202 increases with energy and therefore high energy photons are preferentially emitted at small angles with respect to electrons boost direction . when the collimation is reduced , the observer receives less high energy photons from high latitude electrons  @xcite and therefore the effect of the jet break influences high energy light curves earlier than low energy ones .",
    "conceptually this effect is very similar to the lag between light curves .",
    "it is however more difficult to investigate it mathematically because the angular integral ( [ totpowinter ] ) can not be determined analytically as explained above .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is not sure that the reduction of lorentz factor can explain the absence of a break in optical frequencies when it is observed in x - ray .",
    "a number of suggestions have been put forward to explain observations  @xcite . in the frame work of the model presented here",
    "it can be at least partly explained by the energy dependence of the geometry of the active region .",
    "in fact the material that has lost its energy and has been decelerated is pushed behind the front edge of the shock . due to the scattering it also has a relatively larger transverse momentum ( see simulations in  @xcite for non - relativistic shocks ) .",
    "thus , less boosted particles in the ejecta have intrinsically a larger opening angle .",
    "this leads to a later jet break for the softer photons originating in this extended region .",
    "therefore one does not need additional processes  @xcite , energy  @xcite and/or components  @xcite to explain the breaks .",
    "the complex geometry of matter and fields in the material and shock can explain apparently contradictory observations . as for multiple breaks",
    ", they can be due to the fact that multiple shells are ejected by the central engine .",
    "this is in the same spirit as the structured jet models  @xcite . if they do not completely coalesce both the tail emission and the afterglow due to the external shocks will combinations of radiation from separate remnant shells . in this case",
    "the break of radiation from each shell is independent of others and a far observer who detects the total emission will observe multiple breaks in the emission .",
    "the model described in the previous sections has a large number of parameters .",
    "it would not help to better understand the physics of gamma - ray bursts production and their engine if we can not estimate the parameters of this or any other model from data . on the other hand ,",
    "the only conveyor of information for us is the emission in different energy bands .",
    "therefore , we must find the best ways to extract the information as efficient as possible . in this section",
    "we suggest a procedure for extracting the parameters of the model .",
    "we also discuss their degeneracies .    since the massive detection of grbs by batse",
    ", many efforts have been concentrated to understand their spectrum .",
    "however , very little information could be extracted from the spectra .",
    "the complexity of time and energy dependence of the spectrum ( [ powerdopcorr ] ) explains why the time averaged spectrum does not carry extractable information . as grbs evolve very quickly both in time and in energy , integration over these quantities smears the useful information .",
    "unfortunately the effective detection surface of present gamma - ray detectors is too small and we do not have enough photons to make a broad spectrum in small time intervals .",
    "in this situation hardness ratios and their time variation are more useful quantities .",
    "therefore we first discuss what we can extract from hardness ratios .",
    "consider a power - law distribution for electrons , equation ( [ powerpowlaw ] ) shows that at a given time the spectrum can be expanded as a power of @xmath228 .",
    "the coefficient in front of the integral term does not depend on energy .",
    "therefore , if we neglect @xmath229 i.e. assuming the bulk lorentz factor is very large , the hardness ratios depend only on the integral determined in ( [ firstkint ] ) .",
    "we define the hardness ratio between two bands with logarithmic mean energies @xmath230 and @xmath231 as : hr_12(r ) & = & [ hardnessdef ] + & & _ i ^max_i - ^min_i [ banddef ] the approximations for integrals are valid when @xmath232 .",
    "expression ( [ firstkint ] ) shows that at a constant time / radius hardness ratio depends only on @xmath233 , electron distribution index , and on the lorentz invariant factor @xmath234 where : _m _cc_m^2 [ omegamdef ] is the minimum synchrotron characteristic frequency .",
    "therefore by fitting observational data with ( [ hardnessdef ] ) one can obtain the index of the electron distribution and the time variation of @xmath235 which is a very important quantity . note that as @xmath236 is time / radius dependent we need multiple energy bands and their hardness ratios to make a statistically meaningful fit .",
    "if we release the assumption of power - law distribution for electrons , we can use ( [ powerdopcorr ] ) to get insight into the distribution of electrons lorentz factor and @xmath235 , but they will be degenerate .    once the energy and temporal behaviour of the integral term in ( [ powerdopcorr ] ) is found , the extraction of leading time dependent coefficient @xmath237 ( defined in ( [ fdef ] ) ) from light curves is easy . then if we use one of the models considered in this work or another model for the evolution of @xmath27 , we can determine time / radius variation of @xmath238 the total lorentz factor of the active region .",
    "using ( [ gammabulk ] ) and ( [ betan ] ) one can apriori estimate @xmath239 . however , the latter depends on the relative lorentz factor @xmath64 . if we can roughly estimate the end of the collision from the form of the light curve - for instance if we assume that the end of the collision is when the continuous component begins an exponential decay - then : _ f = ( r ) |_r = r_f [ gammaf ] where @xmath240 is the radius at which the coalescence of the shells finishes .",
    "@xmath234 , @xmath239 , and @xmath241 depend on the fundamental quantities such as magnetic field and thereby on the fraction of kinetic energy of the shell transferred to the electric and magnetic fields , the density of shells , and the initial distance of the collision from the central engine . but with only 3 quantities mentioned above we can not determine all these quantities and their time / radius variation .",
    "an important observable that can help to extract more information from data is the lag .",
    "if we neglect the term proportional to @xmath229 and its derivatives , we can determine functions @xmath242 and @xmath243 in ( [ lagp ] ) and ( [ lagq ] ) from the knowledge about @xmath237 and the integral of @xmath244 ( defined in ( [ hdef ] ) ) explained above .",
    "thus in this way we can determine the lag between two energy bands .",
    "comparison of the observed lags with the expectations from the model helps to estimate some of other quantities such as @xmath214 .",
    "however , as the analytical expression for the lags is very complex , only simulations and fit can permit to solve this inverse problem . using a simpler version of the model presented here ,",
    "this procedure has been applied to analyse the data for grb 060607a  @xcite and to explain some of its peculiar properties  @xcite .    at the beginning of this section",
    "we mentioned that the most complete information about grbs is in the spectrum at short time intervals when the flux does not change significantly .",
    "in fact in practice hardness ratios are calculated by adding together photons in a given energy band and time - rebinned event data to reduce the noise .",
    "when multiple simultaneous hardness ratios are available , they can be considered as a low resolution normalized spectrum in a short time interval . because these quantities give the most direct insight into the physics of the collision , in the rest of this section we investigate in more details the spectral behaviour of the flux at constant time .",
    "first we consider a power - law distribution for electrons .",
    "when @xmath245 hypergeometric functions@xmath246 in ( [ firstkint ] ) and ( [ secondkint ] ) can be expanded as a polynomial with positive or zero power of @xmath247 .",
    "this shows that at the lowest order in @xmath247 the spectrum @xmath248 and therefore @xmath249 .",
    "the power of the coefficient in the second@xmath246 term is larger and therefore for determining the spectrum at zero order it can be neglected .",
    "but for the first order expansion of ( [ powerpowlaw ] ) this term is significant and when it is added the spectrum becomes : < 1 [ ppowlawfirst ] the amount of deviation from the dominant power - law only marginally depends on the index of the electron distribution function @xmath233 . when @xmath250 the higher power of @xmath247 become important and should be considered .",
    "however , as they are all positive , they make the spectrum harder .",
    "this result shows that although small hardening of the spectrum can be obtained in this regime , it is not possible to have a softer spectrum with an index smaller than @xmath251 and closer to what has been observed in many bursts  @xcite .",
    "note also that the addition of terms proportional to @xmath193 can not make the spectrum softer because they have the same form of energy dependence as the dominant terms .",
    "next we consider the regime where @xmath252 . in this regime",
    "there is no analytical expression for  @xmath253 functions .",
    "therefore we use the asymptotic behaviour of bessel functions , @xmath254 , to estimate the integrals in ( [ powerpowlaw ] ) .",

    "k_5/3 ( ) d + & & [ powerexpodist ] for @xmath263 the second integral on the right hand side of ( [ powerexpodist ] ) is small and negligible .",
    "the first integral does not have analytical solution , but using asymptotic behaviour of incomplete @xmath4 function ( [ gammaseries ] ) one can conclude that its behaviour at high energies must be close to an exponential with negative exponent proportional to @xmath158 .",
    "in the beginning of this section we mentioned that most probably @xmath27 is also somehow energy dependent , specially at very low and very high energies . in the latter case",
    "it must be very small , probably exponentially decreasing with energy .",
    "this can also contribute to the existence of an exponential cutoff at high energies .",
    "as for the low energy tail of the spectrum the fact that even the residual energy of cooled electrons can be enough to emit soft photons means that the spectrum in this regime should be much flatter .",
    "this is consistent with the roughly flat spectrum and shallow temporal decline in optical and longer wavelength emissions as observed in most grbs  @xcite .    in conclusion of this section",
    ", we showed that when a relativistic shock is modelled in details and realistic distributions for electrons are considered , the synchrotron emission alone can explain different aspects of the time averaged spectrum of grbs as well as their spectrum in a short interval in which the evolution can be ignored .",
    "evidently , other processes such as inverse compton  @xcite and pair production  @xcite contribute to the total emission but most probably are not the dominant component at low / intermediate energy bands .",
    "nonetheless their contribution should be more important at gev and higher energies  @xcite .",
    "we presented a formulation of the relativistic shocks and synchrotron emission that includes more details than the dominant term considered in the previous calculations .",
    "although we consider spherical shells , most of our results are valid also for non - spherical collimated jets as long as the collimation angle due to the relativistic boost is smaller than collimation angle .",
    "we showed that the lags between light curves at different energies exist in the dominant order and are not only due to the high latitude emissions which are negligible for ultra - relativistic ejecta .",
    "the main reason for such behaviour is the evolution of electric and magnetic fields as well as the evolution of the emitting region which can be in addition energy dependent .",
    "this fact is more evident in the simulations presented in paper ii . despite the absence of high latitude terms in our simulations ,",
    "the presence of lags between the light curves of different energy bands is evident .",
    "for the same reasons the change in the slope of the light curves - what is called breaks - are also energy dependent .",
    "this explains chromatic breaks of the grbs detected by .",
    "the two phenomenological models we considered for the evolution of the active region are physically motivated , but do not have rigorous support from microphysics of the shock .",
    "nonetheless , they can be easily replaced if future simulations of fermi processes lead to a better estimation of the size of the region in which electric and magnetic fields are formed and particles are accelerated and dissipated .",
    "presence of an external magnetic field in the environment of the candidates for central engine of grbs is very plausible .",
    "the formulation present here does not include such a possibility , but an external magnetic field can be added to ( [ magener ] ) .",
    "the modification of the evolution equation of @xmath31 and the flux is straightforward .",
    "many other details such as the effect of metalicity of the ejecta and surrounding material both on the low energy emission and absorption is not considered in this work .",
    "we have also neglected synchrotron self - abortion .",
    "it only affects the low energy bands , nonetheless in hard bursts even optical emission can be affected by self absorption .",
    "we leave the study of this issue , the effect of ionization on the emissions , and the thermalization of shocked material to future works .",
    "the integral in ( [ integdyn ] ) can not be taken analytically .",
    "an analytical approximation is however useful for investigating the effect and importance of the radiation in the dynamics of the shell collision .",
    "here we consider a few approximations for various range of @xmath88 and @xmath109 that determine respectively the strength of the shock and the radiation .    if @xmath264 , the integral in ( [ integdyn ] ) can be calculated analytically : & & _",
    "_0^_(0 ) ( r ) dy   = _",
    "_0^_(0 ) ( r ) [ etatauzero ] & & a_1 = 3 , a_2 = 0 , a_3 = 1 , b_1 = , b_2 = , + & & b_3 = , c_1 = , c_2 = - , c_3 = - . [ etataucoeff ] when @xmath265 is large , as the value of @xmath266 in the integrand of ( [ integdyn ] ) is always less than @xmath261 we can formally expand the term @xmath267 and integrate term by term : & & m_(0)(r ) = ( ) ^ ( ( 3- ) d)^1- \\ { + & & + + & & +  } [ dynmzero ] here@xmath268 is the hypergeometric function and can be expanded as a polynomial of its last argument .",
    "when the latter is less than @xmath261 and the power of the terms in the polynomial are positive , they converge rapidly to zero . when the last argument in@xmath268 is larger than one an analytical extension of this function with negative power in the polynomial expansion exists  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dominant term is always @xmath84 in front of each @xmath269 term . for small @xmath109",
    "this approximation is not valid . in this case",
    "we expand @xmath270 and obtain : & & m_(0)(r ) = ( ) ^ [ ( 3-)d]^1- \\ { + & & - + & & +  } [ dynmzeroetazero ] in the same way we find the following expression for @xmath103 for the quasi steady model and large @xmath271 : & & m_(0)(r ) = ( ( 3- ) d)^1- \\ { \\ { + +  } - ( ( 3-)d)^- + & & \\ { + } } [ steadymzero ] for the case of a small @xmath271 one can use ( [ dynmzeroetazero ] ) and make an expression analogue to ( [ steadymzero ] ) , thus we do not repeat the details here .",
    "we note that when @xmath133 and @xmath272 , i.e. for a constant @xmath20 , ( [ dynmzero ] ) and ( [ steadymzero ] ) are equal as expected .",
    "when @xmath273 , the formation of the active region is very slow . in this case",
    "the energy loss by radiation becomes negligible and @xmath189 decreases only due to the increasing accumulated mass .",
    "note also that @xmath274 as expected .",
    "if the active region varies according to ( [ drquasiend ] ) , the expression for @xmath103 includes only the term @xmath106 in ( [ steadymzero ] ) with a positive sign in front .",
    "although equations([dynmzero ] ) , ( [ steadymzero ] ) , and ( [ dynmzeroetazero ] ) seem quite sophisticated , due to the polynomial representation of @xmath269 , only the few dominant terms are of real interest to us . in most cases we are only interested in the dominant power - law component",
    "however , having expressions beyond the dominant power permits to go much further and calculate quantities such as lags that in a simple power - law approximation can not be determined .",
    "when the kinetic energy of the fast shell does not change significantly @xmath275 and @xmath276 .",
    "this case happens when the radiation has a negligible effect on the kinematic of the shock . assuming a strong shock i.e. @xmath277 , we can use the definition of @xmath268 to investigate the behaviour of @xmath278 at lowest order . for the dynamically driven active region with large @xmath109 and a relatively soft shock , when we expand@xmath268 terms in ( [ dynmzero ] ) up to first order",
    ", @xmath278 becomes : & & m_(0)(r ) ( ) ^ ( ( 3- ) d)^1- _0 ^ - 2 +   + & & \\ { ( 1 - ) +  } + [ dynmzerofirst ] similarly , for small @xmath109 we use ( [ dynmzeroetazero ] ) and obtain : & & m_(0)(r ) ( ) ^ ( ( 3- ) d)^1- _0 ^ - 2 +   + & & \\{- ( ) ^ - 2 + } + [ dynmzerofirsteta ] for a quasi static active region and the same shock conditions as in ( [ steadymzero ] ) the first order @xmath278 is : & & m_(0)(r ) ( ( 3- ) d)^1- ( 1 - ) + & & \\ { - + & & } +  [ quasizerofirst ]",
    "using ( [ nedistpow ] ) to ( [ gammam ] ) , after integration over @xmath47 we obtain the following expression for the spectrum : & & = r^2 r \\{2__m^ d_e ( ) ^-(p+1 ) + & & _ e^-2 _ ^ k_5/3 ( ) d+ g(r ) ( - + & & + + & & ( ) _ _ m^d_e ( ) ^ -(p+1 ) _ e^-4 _",
    "^ k_5/3 ( ) d ) } + [ powerpowlaw ] where @xmath279 is the minimum characteristic frequency of electrons .",
    "the double integrals in the first and last terms of ( [ powerpowlaw ] ) do not have a simple analytical expression .",

    ". these functions do not have simple analytical presentations .",
    "therefore only asymptotic behaviour of power spectrum is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : synchflux ] .    in the same way we can determine an analytical expression for lags when accelerated electrons have a power - law distribution using ( [ kcoeff ] ) to ( [ lagq ] ) and ( [ powerpowlaw ] ) to ( [ secondkint ] ) .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the functions @xmath282 and @xmath283 are both functionals of @xmath284 which contains @xmath47 dependent terms similar to the spectrum @xmath204 .",
    "the function @xmath284 includes bessel and hypergeometric functions and their derivatives .",
    "therefore we can use ( [ powerpowlaw ] ) to ( [ secondkint ] ) to determine them . as the derivatives of hypergeometric functions  @xmath285",
    "are also hypergeometric , lags can be expressed as a sum of  @xmath253 functions .",
    "the calculation is straightforward but long and laborious and we do not present details here because their complexity does not permit to investigate their properties and numerical calculation is needed .",

    "<S> since the suggestion of relativistic shocks as the origin of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in early 90 s , the mathematical formulation of this process has stayed at phenomenological level . </S>",
    "<S> one of the reasons for the slow development of theoretical works has been the simple power - law behaviour of the afterglows hours or days after the prompt gamma - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> it was believed that they could be explained with these formulations . nowadays with the launch of the satellite and implementation of robotic ground follow - ups , gamma - ray bursts and their afterglow </S>",
    "<S> can be observed in multi - wavelength from a few tens of seconds after trigger onward . </S>",
    "<S> these observations have leaded to the discovery of features unexplainable by the simple formulation of the shocks and emission processes used up to now . </S>",
    "<S> some of these features can be inherent to the nature and activities of the grbs central engines which are not yet well understood . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand * _ devil is in details _ * and others may be explained with a more detailed formulation of these phenomena and without adhoc addition of new processes . </S>",
    "<S> such a formulation is the goal of this work . </S>",
    "<S> we present a consistent formulation of the kinematic and dynamics of the collision between two spherical relativistic shells , their energy dissipation , and their coalescence . </S>",
    "<S> it can be applied to both internal and external shocks . </S>",
    "<S> notably , we propose two phenomenological models for the evolution of the emitting region during the collision . </S>",
    "<S> one of these models is more suitable for the prompt / internal shocks and late external shocks , and the other for the afterglow / external collisions as well as the onset of internal shocks . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a number of observables such as flux , lag between energy bands , and hardness ratios . </S>",
    "<S> one of our aims has been a formulation enough complex to include the essential processes , but enough simple such that the data can be directly compared with the theory to extract the value and evolution of physical quantities . to accomplish this goal </S>",
    "<S> , we also suggest a procedure for extracting parameters of the model from data . in a following paper </S>",
    "<S> we numerically calculate the evolution of some simulated models and compare their features with the properties of the observed gamma - ray bursts .    </S>",
