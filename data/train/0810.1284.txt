    "it has long been a goal of astrophysics and cosmology to determine the distribution and nature of the dark matter that populates our galactic halo .",
    "only more recently have we begun to focus on the possibility to detect substructures in the galactic halo @xcite . in hierarchical structure formation , small gravitationally bound dark - matter systems form first and",
    "then merge to form progressively more massive systems . in each stage , some of the earlier generations of structure may remain intact after merging , and so the milky way halo may contain substructures over a wide array of masses .",
    "scaling arguments suggest that substructures may continue all the way down to the smallest mass scales at which there is primordial power @xcite , although the precise details may be uncertain @xcite .",
    "if weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) @xcite make up the dark matter , the cutoff mass should be in the range @xmath1 @xcite , and if axions @xcite make up the dark matter , it may be as small as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "if wimps make up the dark matter , there may be several avenues toward detecting them . with the launch of the fermi gamma - ray space telescope ( formerly glast ) @xcite , however , there is now particular attention being paid to detection of energetic gamma rays from dark - matter annihilation in the galactic halo ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while the diffuse flux from such annihilations have been considered for a long time @xcite , the possibility to detect substructure , through angular variations in the background , is more recent @xcite .",
    "it is possible that individual substructures may be resolved @xcite .",
    "proper motions of the smallest microhalos have also been considered @xcite .    in this paper , we propose the one - point gamma - ray - flux probability distribution function ( pdf ) as a probe of halo substructure . if dark matter is smoothly distributed , then the variation in the number of diffuse - background photons from one pixel to another should arise only from poisson fluctuations . if , however , there is substructure , there will be additional flux variations from pixel to pixel .",
    "this may provide another route ",
    "an alternative to the angular two - point correlation function @xcite  to detect substructure statistically , especially for the very smallest microhalo mass scales .",
    "it may also allow measurement of the substructure mass function , under certain model assumptions outlined below .",
    "we illustrate with a phenomenological model for galactic substructure in which a fraction @xmath3 of the halo is made of dark - matter microhalos with a power - law mass function ( with a lower mass cutoff @xmath4 ) and a constant mass  to  gamma - ray - luminosity ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the next section introduces this model and discusses the constraints from the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) @xcite to the parameter space . in section [ sec : onepoint ] , we calculate the flux pdf for this model and discuss the translation to a discrete distribution of counts in each fermi pixel .",

    "this normalizes the virial mass of the milky way halo to be @xmath21 , and gives @xmath22 as the local density at the solar radius ( @xmath23 kpc ) .",
    "following other studies @xcite , we normalize the mass function by using the results of simulations @xcite to fix the fraction of mass contained in high - mass microhalos . specifically , we choose @xmath3 such that @xmath24 of the total mass of the halo is contained in microhalos of mass @xmath25 .",
    "we then extrapolate the power - law mass function found by the simulations down to a cutoff mass @xmath4 below the simulation resolution ; taking @xmath26 , @xmath3 then becomes a function of @xmath4 : @xmath27 we shall suppress the argument @xmath4 when referring to @xmath3 below .    for a halo model with @xmath28 , we find that approximately @xmath29 of the total halo mass is contained in roughly @xmath30 microhalos in the specified mass range .",

    "the number of sources observed with flux greater than @xmath103 is given by @xmath166 examining this equation shows that @xmath167 is only weakly dependent on the cutoff mass @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , since the observed microhalos essentially comprise a volume - limited sample , for @xmath85 in the range of interest @xmath168 ( at lower @xmath85 , @xmath169 as expected for a flux - limited sample ) . numerical calculation of @xmath170 shows that the observed microhalos will predominantly be those of higher mass @xmath171 ; although lower - mass microhalos are far more numerous , fermi will not be sensitive enough to detect them individually  @xcite .    in certain regions of the parameter space for which fig .",
    "[ fig : parameterspace ] indicates a nontrivial pdf , substructure will be detectable via detection of individual microhalos , even without a detailed analysis of the pdf .",
    "we plot these regions , taking the fermi five - year @xmath172 point - source sensitivity at @xmath67 of @xmath173  @xcite ( note that this sensitivity assumes the same background level as in our determination of the poissonian regime ) . the advantage of the full pdf , however , is that substructure can be detected even in regions of parameter space where individual microhalos elude detection .",
    "measurement of the detailed shape of the pdf can also provide more information on the microhalo mass function and/or spatial distribution in the halo than would be obtained simply by point - source counts ; e.g. , the slope of the power - law tail in the pdf depends upon the slope of the mass function .    note",
    "that we could have done a similar analysis for a more general wimp and substructure model in which some of the parameters ( e.g. , annihilation cross - section and spectrum , or subhalo concentration / boost parameters ) were allowed to vary .",
    "the egret continuum constraint allows for a large range of such models .",
    "however , for simplicity we have only considered the parameter space of line models and the specific substructure model assumed in section  [ sec : egret ] .",
    "we have proposed that the distribution of fluxes measured in individual fermi pixels can be used to probe the existence of substructure in the galactic halo to very small mass scales . by characterizing fluctuations in the diffuse gamma - ray background in this way , the existence of galactic substructure may be inferred statistically even if individual halos can not be detected .",
    "this statistical approach should be viewed as complementary to the use of an angular correlation function @xcite .",
    "since the pdf is a convolution of the microhalo mass function and spatial distribution , constraints to the parameters of these distributions may be obtained by measuring the pdf .",
    "the full pdf we have calculated may be useful even in situations where individual microhalos can be detected .",
    "for example , the flux in a pixel with a @xmath150 excess which is interpreted as detection of a single point source may actually be due to several point sources ; the probability that this is so may be inferred from the pdf .",
    "we have illustrated the pdf that results in a phenomenological model for substructure parameterized a microhalo mass cutoff @xmath4 , and a mass - to - light ratio @xmath73 .",
    "this is almost certainly an oversimplification . in more realistic models ,",
    "the mass function may differ from the particular power law we have assumed .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio may depend on the microhalo mass , and there may even be a spread of luminosities for each mass . the spatial distribution of microhalos may not trace the galactic halo .",
    "similarly , contributions to the pdf from astrophysical backgrounds ( e.g. , from cosmic - ray spallation or extragalactic sources ) may need to be considered before a complete comparison of our model predictions with data can be made @xcite .    in our p(d ) analysis , we did not consider the dependence of the angular resolution on the photon energy .",
    "furthermore , we have also assumed here that each microhalo will fall within a single resolution element of fermi .",
    "taking into account the finite angular size of each microhalo will reduce the length of the power - law tails in the pdf , and will decrease the region of parameter space in which the pdf can probe substructure .",
    "however , note that individual extended sources will also be more difficult to detect than point sources . a generalization of eq .",
    "[ eqn : detect ] will give a smaller number of detectable extended sources ; the corresponding lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : parameterspace ] will also shift upwards .",
    "thus , there will still be an appreciable region of parameter space in which the pdf can be used to detect substructure even if individual sources can not be detected .",
    "moreover , a conservative rough estimate of the size of these microhalos can be found by approximating the microhalo mass density @xmath174 , assuming a formation redshift of @xmath175 and a concentration parameter of @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation then gives the angular size of the closest and most extended microhalos as @xmath177 .",
    "thus , if the beam size is increased such that the majority of extended microhalos fall within a single beam , then the point source p(d ) formalism presented here is roughly valid .",
    "a more careful generalization may be required for comparison to data .",
    "we leave the inclusion of these additional levels of complication to future work .",
    "in addition to these future directions , one may also consider going further by combining the angular - correlation and pdf approaches .",
    "for example , the full two - point flux probability distribution function can be calculated and may provide additional observables with which to constrain the models or to distinguish a dark - matter background from other astrophysical backgrounds . again",
    ", this is left for future investigation .",
    "this work was supported by the sherman fairchild foundation ( sa ) , doe de - fg03 - 92-er40701 , and the gordon and betty moore foundation .",
    "here we derive the relation between the flux - density distribution @xmath102 and the flux pdf @xmath99 .",
    "such a calculation is termed `` @xmath178 analysis '' in the literature , as it was first performed for observations of faint radio sources that produced `` deflections '' of the measuring apparatus .",
    "this @xmath178 analysis is useful in determining if an observed diffuse background is actually composed of numerous faint point sources .",
    "if this is the case , then there will be fluctuations in the diffuse signal from the random poisson clustering of point sources in each beam .",
    "the shape of @xmath99 thus depends not only on @xmath102 , but also the mean number @xmath179 of sources [ eq .  ( [ eqn : mu ] ) ] in each beam .",
    "we wish to find the probability distribution for a total flux @xmath103 in a beam , given that it is the sum @xmath180 of the fluxes @xmath181 from individual microhalos .",
    "each of the @xmath181 is a random variable with probability distribution @xmath182 .",
    "furthermore , the number @xmath183 of fluxes @xmath181 entering into the sum is itself a random variable given by a poisson distribution with mean @xmath179 .",
    "let us call @xmath184 the probability that @xmath183 random variables @xmath181 sum to @xmath103 ; i.e. , the probability that @xmath183 microhalos emit a total flux @xmath103 . then @xmath185 where @xmath186 is a poisson probability distribution for @xmath183 with mean @xmath179 .",
    "it now remains to determine @xmath184 . for @xmath187 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath188 ; @xmath102 is given .",
    "for @xmath189 , @xmath184 is given by @xmath190    the easiest way to compute eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pkf ] ) is to note that the dirac delta function transforms the integral into a convolution @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us examine the integral for @xmath191 : @xmath192 it follows that @xmath193 ; then by induction , @xmath184 is given by @xmath102 convolved ( or autocorrelated ) with itself @xmath183 times .",
    "using the convolution theorem , it then follows that @xmath194 where @xmath195 denotes a fourier transform .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : pkfft ] ) also holds for @xmath187 ( and trivially for @xmath196 ) .    inserting eq .",

    "although the presence of the inverse fourier transform prevents further analytic simplification in general , this expression can be computed numerically using fast fourier transforms on a discretized @xmath102 .",
