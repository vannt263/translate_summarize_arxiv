    "observations of bulges in nearby galaxies reveal the presence of massive dark objects whose dynamical influence on the surrounding stars is consistent with their being smbhs ( e.g. kormandy & richstone  1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the masses of these smbhs correlate with properties of the host galaxy , including the luminosity of the bulge ( kormendy & richstone  1995 ) , the mass of the bulge ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , the stellar velocity dispersion of the bulge ( ferrarese & merritt  2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ) and the concentration of the bulge ( graham et al .  2002 ) .",
    "the tightest relation , with intrinsic scatter of @xmath23 dex , appears to be between smbh mass and bulge velocity dispersion ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter t02 ) .",
    "significant effort has been invested in determining parameters that describe this relation , which is usually parameterised using the log - linear functional form @xmath24 the value of the power - law slope @xmath5 has been a matter of some debate ( see t02 for a review ) .",
    "recent estimates have @xmath25 ( t02 ) and @xmath26 ( ferrarese & ford  2004 ) .",
    "these values differ by @xmath222-sigma , a difference which may be attributable to systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used by different groups ( t02 ) .",
    "although the connection between smbhs and their host galaxies is not yet clear , it seems very likely that their evolution is closely intertwined .",
    "it also seems likely , given the small intrinsic scatter in the relation that the value of @xmath5 will yield important clues regarding the physics of smbh evolution ( e.g. silk & rees  1998 ; wyithe & loeb  2003 ; king  2004 ; miralda - escude  2004 ; saznov et al .",
    "moreover , studies of smbh demographics ( e.g. yu & tremaine  2002 ; shankar et al .",
    "2004 ) rely on this relation to estimate quantities of astrophysical interest like the local smbh mass density . for these reasons , and given the heroic efforts that have been made to measure smbh masses and host velocity dispersions , it is important to make statistically robust estimates of parameters that describe the @xmath12 relation .    rather than assume a powerlaw relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 we take a more general approach in this paper .",
    "suppose we have an unknown relation @xmath27",
    ". this relation may be expanded in a taylor series in @xmath3 about @xmath28km / s , which yields to second order @xmath29 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the zeroth and first order coefficients in this expansion correspond to @xmath7 and @xmath5 in the usual log - linear relation .",
    "however in addition to @xmath7 and @xmath5 we also consider the possibility of a log - quadratic term .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 therefore provides a measure of the deviation from a pure powerlaw of the @xmath12 relation .",
    "we show that there is a non - linear contribution to the @xmath30 relation , and that the assumption of a log - linear relation has biased estimates of the power - law slope . for the local sample of t02",
    "we show that the variation in log - linear slope over the range of @xmath1 in the sample is larger than both the statistical uncertainty in the slope of the log - linear relation and the 2-sigma difference between the estimates of t02 and ferrarese  ( 2002 ) .",
    "note that ( with the exceptions of   [ choice ] and the appendices ) we restrict our attention to the statistical bias in estimation of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 from smbh masses and galaxy velocity dispersions summarised in t02 . for further discussion of possible systematic errors in the measured parameters",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 themselves we refer the reader to t02 and to merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first discuss possible bias in the local sample of smbhs with respect to parameter fitting (   [ biasfit ] ) . then in   [ msig ]",
    "we repeat the parameter fitting analysis of t02 and demonstrate that the value of @xmath5 in a log - linear relation depends systematically on which low velocity dispersion galaxies are included in the sample .",
    "we then show that a log - quadratic form for the @xmath31 relation provides an improved fit which is not systematically sensitive to the galaxy sample (   [ quadmsig ] ) .",
    "the dependence of this conclusion on the method of smbh mass estimation and resolution of the smbh sphere of influence , as well as the definition of the velocity dispersion is discussed in ",
    ". a bayesian approach to parameter estimation in the @xmath12 relation and quantification of the systematic bias in parameter estimation are described in   [ bayes ] .",
    "this approach allows an unbiased analysis for the local sample which is presented in   [ results ] . in   [ results_bulge ]",
    "we apply our analysis to the relation between smbh and bulge mass using the sample of haering & rix  ( 2004 ) .",
    "we present some discussion in ",
    "[ discussion ] , before summarising our conclusions in   [ conclusion ] .",
    "finally , in two appendices we analyse alternative samples to the one described in t02 .",
    "a first question that should be considered concerns whether or not the local smbh sample , and therefore the resulting estimates of the @xmath31 relation are statistically fair with respect to parameter estimation .",
    "the best - fit log - linear @xmath12 relation ( t02 ; ferrarese  2002 ) drops below @xmath32 for velocity dispersions smaller than @xmath33km / s , still within the range of @xmath1 in the local sample .",
    "however no kinematic detections of smbh masses have been published below @xmath34 .",
    "does this lack of low mass smbhs result in biased estimates of the slope in a log - linear @xmath12 relation ?",
    "ferrarese  ( 2003 ) has suggested that the reason for the dearth of smbhs with @xmath35 is partly instrumental sensitivity .",
    "smbhs with masses smaller than @xmath36 are expected to reside in dwarf galaxies , with velocity dispersions below 50km / s .",
    "the sphere of influence of these smbhs would be observable only in the most nearby cases .",
    "ferrarese  ( 2003 ) has produced a scatter plot of the local smbh population in smbh mass and distance based on a combination of the cfa redshift survey ( huchra et al .",
    "1990 ) and the relation between smbh mass and bulge luminosity .",
    "for the nearest group of galaxies at @xmath37mpc , resolving the smbh sphere of influence limits detection to smbhs with masses in excess of @xmath34 .",
    "ferrarese  ( 2003 ) goes on to suggest that in the nearby dwarf galaxies , individual stars become resolved , but are too faint to allow dynamical studies , and that enlargement of the kinematically detected sample to include smbhs below @xmath38 will require campaigns using telescopes with apertures in excess of 8 m , combined with resolution of better than 0.02  .",
    "one might therefore suppose that there is a selection bias in the smbh sample for smbhs that are larger than @xmath38 .",
    "such a selection bias would lead to biased estimates of the @xmath12 relation .",
    "however inspection of the local sample shows that one of the smallest smbhs observed ( n7457 ) lies at a distance well beyond where its sphere of influence would have been resolved by hst ( ferrarese  2003 ) .",
    "moreover , in the velocity range 70km@xmath39s@xmath40380km@xmath39s@xmath41 there are no galaxies in which a kinematic search has been conducted by the nuker team , and where a smbh was not found ( s. tremaine private communication ) .",
    "since these galaxies are not selected based on their expected smbh mass , there should be no bias against selection of low mass ( or high mass ) smbhs _ at a fixed velocity dispersion_. one can therefore estimate the expected smbh mass given a velocity dispersion from the local smbh sample , without bias introduced through selection .",
    "on the other hand , the sample _ is _ biased if one wants to estimate the velocity dispersion at a fixed smbh mass .",
    "the low surface brightness of galaxies with large velocity dispersions results in a maximum velocity dispersion where smbhs can be measured ( ferrarese  2003 ) .",
    "this combined with the exponential decline in the number density of such galaxies may result in an upper cutoff in the velocity dispersions found in the observed sample .",
    "a parametric fit that treated velocity dispersion rather than smbh mass as the dependent variable would therefore lead to a biased estimate of the parameters in the @xmath12 relation .",
    "clearly the selection function for the sample of smbhs is complex . in particular",
    ", the distribution of velocity dispersions in the sample does not reflect the overall distribution of galaxies .",
    "the non - uniformity of the distribution of velocity dispersions results in statistical inferences for parameters in equation  ( [ fit ] ) that vary with the statistic used ( merritt & ferrarese  2001 ) .",
    "this implies that some or all of the estimates are biased . in order to make an unbiased estimate for a parameter like the power - law slope @xmath5",
    "one must determine the bias inherent in the particular statistic used . in this paper",
    "we overcome the selection bias introduced by the inhomogeneous distribution of velocity dispersions via an investigation of the smbh mass vs. velocity dispersion relation in mock monte - carlo samples .",
    "given that we have access to a sample which is unbiased in @xmath42 as a function of @xmath1 ( the local sample , summarised in t02 ) , and in the absence of a theory where velocity dispersion is regulated by smbh mass ( theoretical prejudice ) , we follow tradition and restrict our attention to parameter fitting where @xmath43 is the dependent variable as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "tremaine et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have compiled a list of @xmath44 galaxies ( the local sample ) with reliable determinations of both smbh mass ( @xmath0 ) and central velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 , defined as the luminosity weighted dispersion in a slit aperture of half length @xmath45 , the effective radius of the spheroid ) . the sample ( sch \" odel et al .",

    "is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] which illustrates the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we begin by repeating the analysis of t02 who estimate the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath5 through minimisation of a @xmath46 variable that accounts for uncertainties in both @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath46 variable used is @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the logarithm of smbh mass in solar masses and the logarithm of velocity dispersion in units of 200km / s respectively .",
    "the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the uncertainties in dex for these parameters .",
    "this expression ( equation  [ chi2 ] ) is symmetric in @xmath43 and @xmath3 .",
    "one might expect this to be a favourable property since the fit does not include any preconceived notions of the physical origin of the relation . in t02 an estimate of the intrinsic scatter @xmath52 in the @xmath12 relation [ as defined in the @xmath53 ( or @xmath0 ) direction ] was established by adding @xmath54 to the denominator in equation  ( [ chi2 ] ) .",
    "the intrinsic scatter that resulted in a reduced minimum @xmath46 of unity was @xmath55 dex .",
    "the best fit solution for a linear @xmath12 relation from t02 has @xmath56 and @xmath57 , resulting in residuals for the three smallest galaxies that are greater than zero .",
    "in addition , the largest three galaxies also have residuals that are greater than zero .",
    "this behaviour is symptomatic of a scenario where a linear relation has been fitted to a non - linear sample .",
    "the sample described in t02 is dominated by galaxies with velocity dispersions in the range @xmath58km / s .",
    "there are a handful of smbhs at the centers of galaxies with smaller velocity dispersions , including the milky - way .",
    "these smbhs all have masses in excess of @xmath59 .",
    "the four galaxies with the lowest dispersions have a large influence over the slope inferred for a log - linear relation .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows how the estimate of @xmath5 varies as the galaxies with the lowest velocity dispersions are removed from the sample .",
    "two trends are apparent .",
    "firstly , the uncertainty in @xmath5 is reduced by more than 50% by the presence of the smallest few galaxies .",
    "secondly , the lowest velocity dispersions reduce the estimate of the slope from @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "the estimate remains near @xmath62 as the next 6 smallest velocities are removed from the sample .",
    "the systematic variation may be seen visually in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , where the best - fit relations are plotted over the corresponding ranges of velocity dispersion .",
    "the systematic trend of a slope that increases by 1.5-sigma when the smallest 3 of @xmath63 galaxies are removed from the sample points to a fit that is systematically biased .",
    "one possibility is that a log - linear relation is not a good description of the data set .",
    "note that a poor fit can not be identified through a reduced value of @xmath46 that is significantly greater than unity .",
    "this is because the value of intrinsic scatter ( @xmath64 ) is determined by the condition that the reduced value of @xmath46 equal unity for the best fit solution .",
    "however we can try to find a functional form that provides a better description of the data .",
    "one possible scenario involves a characteristic velocity dispersion , with different powerlaws for large and small galaxies . to test this idea we attempt to locate a value of @xmath1 around which the slope of the relation changes by fitting two power - law slopes , one either side of a characteristic velocity dispersion .",
    "we find that the fit is improved by allowing the slope at high @xmath1 to be steeper than at low @xmath1 , and that the data prefers a break velocity somewhere in the range @xmath65km / s ( 1-sigma ) .",
    "of course , while there is at least some theoretical motivation for a log - linear relation , there is no reason to suppose that the @xmath12 relation should be a double power - law .    in the following",
    "we take a more general approach .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a general relation @xmath66 can be expanded in a taylor series to second order yielding @xmath67 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent log - linear and log - quadratic contributions to the @xmath12 relation .",
    "we have ( arbitrarily ) expanded about @xmath28km / s , which corresponds to the median velocity dispersion in the relation .",
    "the value of @xmath6 provides a measure of whether or not a log - linear relation provides a good description of the data .",
    "we have repeated the @xmath46 minimisation using equation  ( [ fit_quad ] ) .",
    "the 1 , 1.5 , 2 and 2.5-sigma ellipsoids and the minimum @xmath46 is 1 , 2.71 , 4 and 6.63 respectively . when these contours are projected onto an individual parameter axis , they correspond to the 68% , 90% , 95% and 99% confidence intervals on those parameters . in the text",
    "we refer to these as the 1 , 1.5 , 2 and 2.5-sigma error elipsoids . ] for @xmath5 and @xmath6 are shown in the upper right - hand panel of figure  [ fig2 ] for the local sample .",
    "an intrinsic scatter of @xmath68 dex results in a reduced @xmath46 of unity for the best fit solution .",
    "thus a log - quadratic fit admits a slightly smaller intrinsic scatter than the log - linear relation .",
    "the solution shows evidence for a positive log - quadratic term at around the 85% level .",
    "the most likely solution has @xmath69 and @xmath70 with 1-sigma uncertainties of 0.35 and 1.1 respectively .",
    "the best fit log - quadratic relation is plotted in the upper - left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "parameter estimation using a log - linear relation corresponds to the conditional probability for @xmath5 given @xmath71 .",
    "the horizontal grey line in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows the cut through the bi - variate probability distribution for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the contours of the bi - variate distribution cross this line centered around @xmath72 , which is consistent with expectations from the log - linear fit .",
    "however the most probable value @xmath57 for the log - linear fit lies near the 1.5-sigma contour of the log - quadratic fit .",
    "this illustrates the point that a log - quadratic form provides a much improved description of the local sample .    unlike the log - linear case",
    ", the four galaxies with the lowest dispersions do not have a large influence on the log - quadratic fit .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that the estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not vary systematically as the galaxies with the lowest velocity dispersions are removed from the sample .",
    "the most likely solution is similar for samples including all galaxies and for samples including only the largest 20 galaxies , indicating that there is evidence for a log - quadratic term in the main group of massive galaxies , and that the deviation from a power - law is not dominated by inclusion of low mass galaxies in the sample .",
    "the variation of the best - fit relation as small galaxies are removed from the sample may be seen visually in the left panel of figure  [ fig2 ] , where the best - fit relations are plotted over the corresponding ranges of velocity dispersion .",
    "the above discussion relates to an expansion of the general relation @xmath73 which is truncated at second order .",
    "we found that the data prefers a non - zero contribution from a quadratic term . before continuing we mention the possibility of a non - zero contribution from an additional log - cubic term .",
    "we have repeated the above analysis for the third order relation @xmath74 ^ 2\\\\   & + & \\beta_3\\left[\\log(\\sigma/200{\\rm km } \\,{\\rm s}^{-1})\\right]^3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by minimising @xmath46 over the other parameters , we find a solution @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "not surprisingly there is a large correlation between the odd terms @xmath5 and @xmath78 .",
    "this correlation increases the uncertainties on individual parameters . despite having an additional free parameter ,",
    "the log - cubic relation requires a larger intrinsic scatter to achieve a @xmath46 of unity than the log - quadratic relation .",
    "moreover there is no evidence from the @xmath46 minimization for a log - cubic term in the local sample .",
    "therefore in the remainder of the paper we restrict our attention to the log - quadratic form for the @xmath12 relation .",
    "the local smbh sample described in t02 contains galaxies with smbh mass estimates obtained from data that did not resolve the sphere of influence ( e.g. marconi & hunt  2003 ) , and the accuracy of these masses has been called into question ( e.g. merritt & ferrarese  2001 ; ferrarese & ford  2004 ; marconi & hunt  2003 ) .",
    "in addition , the sample has smbhs with masses inferred using four separate techniques , including stellar dynamics , stellar proper motions , astrophysical masers and dynamics of gaseous disks .",
    "moreover , adding to this inhomogeneity are the different definitions for the velocity dispersion that have been supported by different groups . in this section",
    "we investigate the effect that these properties of the sample may have on the conclusion of a log - quadratic @xmath12 relation .",
    "these issues are also discussed further in two appendices (   [ app1 ] and [ app2 ] ) .",
    "some of the original smbh mass estimates based on ground based stellar dynamical data ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) lie systematically above the @xmath12 relation defined by other galaxies in the local sample with _",
    "more secure _ mass estimates by as much as 2 orders of magnitude ( ferrarese & merritt  2000 ) . the correlation between the offset and the galaxies distance has been interpreted as evidence that the lack of resolution in these early observations resulted in a systematic resolution dependent error in the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) masses ( merritt & ferrarese  2001 ) .",
    "of course it is not clear that one can assume masses to be incorrect because they do nt agree with the log - linear @xmath12 relation as described by the remaining smbhs .",
    "this would require the argument that the _ observational _ mass estimates must be wrong because they disagree with the a _ theoretical _ preconception that the @xmath12 relation is log - linear .",
    "however concern has been expressed that that smbh masses estimated using data that does not resolve the sphere of influence are unreliable ( e.g. ferrarese & ford  2004 ) .",
    "marconi & hunt  ( 2003 ) have ordered the smbh sample in terms of the degree to which the smbh sphere of influence is resolved .",
    "there are 4 galaxies for which the sphere of influence is smaller than the resolution ( the half - width - at - half - maximum ) of the data .",
    "in addition , marconi & hunt  ( 2003 ) classed some of the mass estimates as unreliable for other reasons such as unknown disk inclination , resulting in the removal of a further 3 galaxies from the sample . in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the remaining 24 galaxies ( dark points ) .",
    "those smbh masses designated by marconi & hunt  ( 2003 ) as being unreliable , and those with spheres of influence that are not resolved are plotted in grey . in the right panel of figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the log - quadratic fit to these 24 galaxies .",
    "the result should be compared with the fit to the full sample , the 1-sigma error ellipse for which is also plotted ( thick contour ) .",
    "we see that the removal of the 7 _ unreliable _ galaxies has slightly increased the allowed range of @xmath6 .",
    "however the solution still prefers a non - linear term , the 1-sigma error ellipse lies near the @xmath71 line .    in the lower right- and lower - left panels of figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we show the log - quadratic fits to the sample of galaxies with smbh masses determined via stellar dynamics , and by other methods respectively .",
    "each of these samples also shows evidence for a non - linear contribution to the @xmath12 relation .",
    "the sample containing smbhs with resolved spheres of influence , and the sample containing only smbhs with masses determined via stellar dynamics have very similar solutions , indicating that smbhs with masses determined via stellar dynamics in cases where the sphere of influence is unresolved do not skew the analysis and may be included in the sample .",
    "the question of the dependence of resolution on the accuracy of the smbh mass determined was investigated by gebhardt et al .",
    "they re - evaluated the smbh masses for galaxies where the smbh mass had been previously determined with ground - based imaging using higher resolution space - based data .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that _",
    "i ) _ the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) masses were indeed overestimated , by up to a factor of 3 , due to the assumption of 2-integral models ; and _ ii ) _ comparison of 3-integral modeling of low - resolution ground based and high resolution space based data demonstrates that the smbh mass determinations described in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) contain no resolution induced bias .",
    "in other words , provided that the modeling is sufficiently general , the high resolution data increases the precision but not the accuracy of smbh mass estimates ( see figure  8 of gebhardt et al .",
    "this implies that if the resolution were not sufficient , then the lower limit on bh mass would be @xmath79 ( i.e. no definite detection ) .",
    "thus the effect of spatial resolution is built into the estimate of the range of allowable mass .",
    "the masses of smbhs in galaxies where the sphere of influence is not resolved should therefore be just as reliable as those where it is resolved , in the sense that the determination is just as accurate but carries less precision ( richstone et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "at this point it should be noted that recent work from valluri , merritt & emsellem  ( 2004 ) has suggested that stellar dynamical estimates of smbh masses are unreliable even when the smbh sphere of influence is resolved .",
    "this unreliability is due to a degeneracy between the mass - to - light ratio and smbh mass , which was shown to become more prominent as the number of orbits used in the modeling is increased . on the other hand , richstone et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have countered this claim .",
    "they suggest that while it is true that the allowed range of smbh mass increases with the number of orbits assumed , this range asymptotes to provide a true estimate of smbh mass . thus they conclude that provided the number of orbits is sufficient , smbh mass estimation from reconstruction of stellar orbits using kinematic data can lead to a robust smbh mass estimate .",
    "richstone et al .",
    "( 2004 ) estimate the number of orbits that are required to achieve convergence in the mass estimate and conclude that published mass estimates have been made using a sufficiently large orbit library and are therefore reliable",
    ".    finally , the definition of the independent variable may be an important factor in the evaluation of any non - linear contribution to the @xmath12 relation .",
    "a central velocity dispersion has been advocated by ferrarese & merritt  ( 2001 ) , while an effective velocity dispersion was used by gebhardt et al .",
    "the pros and cons of these different variables were summarised by merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the central velocity dispersion is more easily measured than the effective velocity dispersion which requires both surface photometry and spatially resolved spectroscopy over the effective radius of the galaxy . as a result",
    ", central velocity dispersions have been measured for many galaxies , while the effective velocity dispersions require significant effort to obtain the required data . on the other hand",
    "the effective velocity dispersion better represents the velocity dispersion over the stellar spheroid , and may therefore be expected to offer a better representation of the depth of the spheroids gravitational potential well .",
    "moreover t02 found that the smbh itself could effect the value of the central velocity by up to 30% in some cases . in order to evaluate the effect of changing the independent variable from an effective to a central velocity dispersion , we repeat the above analysis on sub - samples of the local sample of smbhs ( values of central velocity dispersion are available in merritt & ferrarese  2001 & ferrarese & ford  2004 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] , correspond to , and are qualitatively similar to to those in figure  [ fig3 ] , where the effective velocity dispersion was the independent variable .",
    "in particular , if the smbhs whose spheres of influence are not resolved are removed from the sample , then the sample still prefers a non - linear contribution .",
    "this non - linearity is at higher significance where the central rather than effective velocity dispersion is used .",
    "similarly , samples of smbhs with masses determined via stellar dynamics and by other methods each prefer a non - linear @xmath12 relation .",
    "this analysis shows the previously known result that use of the central velocity dispersion results in an estimate of the @xmath31 relation that is steeper than where the effective velocity dispersion is used .    in summary , samples where the smbh masses were estimated by stellar dynamics , samples where the smbh masses were determined via other methods , and samples where the smbh masses are _ secure _",
    "( marconi & hunt  2003 ) , each have a fit that prefers the inclusion of a log - quadratic term .",
    "the sample of smbh masses determined via other methods shows the strongest non - linear tendency , but with the largest uncertainty .",
    "this non - linear component of the @xmath12 relation is present whether the independent variable is considered to be the central velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt  2000 ) or the effective velocity dispersion ( t02 ) . in light of these results , we consider only the full local sample as described in t02 , with the effective velocity dispersion as the independent variable , in the remainder of this paper .",
    "our aim in this paper is to determine the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as the intrinsic scatter ( designated @xmath8 ) of smbhs around equation  ( [ fit_quad ] ) .",
    "our general approach adds two features relative to the @xmath46 analysis described in the previous sections .",

    "using the local sample of smbhs we have demonstrated that the parameter describing a log - linear fit to the @xmath12 relation is sensitive to the inclusion of individual galaxies at a level larger than the statistical uncertainty .",

    "we have tested the sensitivity of this conclusion to different sub - samples of smbh masses determined via different techniques , as well as smbhs with and without resolved spheres of influence .",
    "the log - quadratic fit implies a non - linear contribution to the @xmath31 relation in a sub - sample of galaxies that contain only smbhs whose spheres of influence were resolved , in a sub - sample containing only smbhs with masses determined through stellar dynamics , and in a sub - sample containing only smbhs with masses determined only by non stellar dynamical methods .",
    "moreover the non - linearity is present in each sub - sample whether the central or effective velocity dispersion is used as the independent variable .",
    "smbh masses in active galaxies estimated via reverberation mapping offer an avenue to increase the smbh sample for study of the @xmath31 relation .",
    "we find that the combination of the 14 galaxies with reverberation smbh masses and measured velocity dispersions ( onken et al .",
    "2004 ) with the local smbh sample leads to a log - quadratic relation with the same best fit as the local sample alone .",
    "the @xmath12 relation can be extended to lower masses through the inclusion of single epoch virial estimates of smbh masses based on observations of agn ( barth , greene & ho  2004 ) . in a @xmath46 analysis",
    "the best - fit log - quadratic @xmath12 relation is unchanged by the addition of a sample of 16 low mass smbhs .",
    "however the uncertainty in @xmath6 is reduced .",
    "we find that in the absence of a systematic error in the normalisation of smbh masses between the local and agn samples , the @xmath12 relation described by the combined sample deviates from a power - law at greater than the 2-sigma level .",
    "the best - fit log - quadratic relation predicts a minimum mass for smbhs in galaxies of @xmath205 , which should reside in bulges with @xmath206km@xmath39s@xmath41 .",
    "a log - quadratic @xmath12 relation has important implications for smbh demography .",
    "in particular , estimates of the local smbh mass - function that utilise the log - quadratic @xmath31 relation describe densities of smbhs with @xmath219 that are orders of magnitude larger than expected for a log - linear @xmath12 relation .",
    "in addition the departure from a power - law should provide important clues regarding the astrophysics responsible for the @xmath12 relation .",
    "for example one recent model describing the effects of radiative feedback on smbh growth predicts departure from a power - law relation , including steepening of the relation at large @xmath1 ( saznov et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we have also applied our analysis to the relation between smbh and bulge mass using the sample described in haering & rix  ( 2004 ) .",
    "we find evidence for a log - quadratic term in the @xmath129 relation ( at the 1-sigma level ) , with @xmath220 and @xmath20 .",
    "we find an intrinsic scatter of @xmath21 dex . since we find the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath12 relation to be @xmath113 dex , there is @xmath221 more scatter in the smbh mass at fixed bulge mass than at fixed velocity dispersion .",
    "the sample of kinematically detected smbhs will not grow by a large factor in the foreseeable future ( ferrarese  2003 ) .",
    "progress in understanding the statistical properties of the smbh population will instead come via estimates of smbh masses that are based on reverberation mapping studies .",
    "the increased sample of smbhs will offer the possibility of more clearly defining the local @xmath31 relation ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ; ferrarese et al .",

    "the author acknowledges the support of the australian research council .",
    "following the discovery of the @xmath12 relation ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese & merritt  2000 ) , there has been debate in the literature among the different groups regarding inconsistencies in the value of the measured slope .",
    "these differences have been attributed to several causes including use of biased statistics ( merritt & ferrarese  2001 ) and systematic differences in the velocity dispersions used for the host galaxies ( t02 ) .",
    "we have shown that the slope @xmath5 of a log - linear relation is substantially changed by the presence or absence of one or a couple of the smallest galaxies in the sample .",
    "given the different samples of velocity dispersions that have been employed by the different groups , the bias introduced by the assumption of a log - linear relation may therefore be more or less significant for different samples .",
    "merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) presented an analysis of the log - linear relation for three different samples .",
    "the first two samples were drawn from ferrarese & merritt  ( 2000 , sample  1 ) , and from the additional galaxies presented by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 , sample 2 ) .",
    "the accuracy of some of the additional smbh masses included by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) has been called into question on the basis that the smbh sphere of influence was not resolved ( e.g. merritt & ferrarese  2001 ) . in addition ,",
    "merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) discuss the combined sample from these two sub - samples . for sample  2 merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) computed aperture corrected central velocity dispersions , so that all galaxies in the combined sample could be considered when estimating correlations between smbh mass and both a central ( ferrarese & merritt  2000 ) and an effective velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al .",
    "merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) present fits for the slope @xmath5 of a log - linear relation to these samples using regression with bi - variate errors and intrinsic scatter ( their label brs ) .",
    "we first consider the correlation of smbh mass with central velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt  2000 ) .",
    "merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) find @xmath222 and @xmath223 for samples  1 and 2 respectively .",
    "for the combined sample they get @xmath224",
    ". samples  1 and 2 differ at the 2-sigma level , while the combined sample leads to a slope that lies between the two . to mimic this analysis for a log - quadratic relation we minimise the following @xmath46 statistic @xmath225 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the logarithm of smbh mass in solar masses and the logarithm of velocity dispersion in units of 200km / s respectively .",
    "the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the uncertainties in dex for these parameters .",
    "the variable @xmath64 is the intrinsic scatter , adjusted to yield a reduced @xmath46 of unity for the best - fit solution . in figure  [ fig12 ]",
    "we show the 1 , 1.5 , 2 and 2.5-sigma error ellipsoids for @xmath5 and @xmath6 in sample-1 , sample-2 and the combined sample .",
    "the 1-sigma ellipsoid for the combined sample is shown in the other panels for comparison , and the best fit relations are plotted over the data in the upper left panel .",
    "the grey regions represent the 1-sigma range for @xmath5 determined by merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the ellipsoids show that all three samples suggest a positive quadratic term is present in the @xmath12 relation .",
    "the values of @xmath5 determined by merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) are conditional probabilities for @xmath5 given @xmath71 , and so should correspond to regions where the error ellipsoids cross the @xmath71 line .",
    "figures  [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] show this to be the case .",
    "the inclusion of a quadratic term in the relation leads to similar estimates for parameters using each sample , with @xmath226 and @xmath227 lying inside the 1-sigma ellipsoids .",
    "we also investigate the correlation between smbh mass and effective velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al .",
    "the values for effective velocity dispersion @xmath1 in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did not include an estimate of the uncertainty . in the absence of quoted uncertainties ,",
    "merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) assumed different values for the uncertainty in effective velocity dispersion and showed that increasing the uncertainty lead to steeper best fit slopes , and to consistency between fits for samples 1 and 2 .",
    "t02 has since advocated 5% for the fractional uncertainty in effective velocity dispersion .",
    "we assume 5% errors in @xmath1 and adopt @xmath228km / s for the milky - way . in this case merritt & ferrarese  ( 2000 ) found @xmath229 and @xmath230 for samples 1 and 2 respectively . for the combined sample , they found @xmath231 . in figure  [ fig13 ]",
    "we show the results for the log - quadratic fit in this case .",
    "the results are consistent for a log - quadratic relation , with @xmath232 and @xmath233 lying inside the 1-sigma error ellipses of all three samples .",
    "consistency between the best fit log - quadratic relations for samples  1 and 2 therefore does not require uncertainties in @xmath1 to be larger than 5% , the value advocated by the nuker team ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "finally we compare the estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for relations between smbh mass , and the central or effective velocity dispersions using the combined sample .",
    "the use of an effective velocity dispersion ( with 5% uncertainty ) leads to smaller values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 relative to a fit using central velocity dispersions .",
    "merritt & ferrarese  ( 2001 ) found that this difference could be removed by increasing the uncertainty in @xmath1 to greater than 10% .",
    "however a solution with @xmath234 and @xmath235 lies inside the 1-sigma error ellipsoids in both cases .",
    "overall we find that a solution with @xmath236 and @xmath237 ( shown by the large cross in figures  [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] ) lies on or inside the 1-sigma error ellipsoids of all three samples using either the central or the effective velocity dispersions as the independent variable .",
    "therefore if a log - quadratic @xmath12 relation is used we find that there is no significant disparity between the different samples .",
    "in a recent review , ferrarese & ford  ( 2004 ) have compiled an updated sample of local smbhs , listed in their table - ii . of the 38 mass estimates , they class 8 as unreliable . of the remaining 30 smbhs ,",
    "the mass observations resolved the sphere of influence in only 25 cases .",
    "ferrarese & ford  ( 2004 ) used this sample of 25 reliable mass estimates where the sphere of influence is resolved to generate a log - linear fit to the @xmath12 relation .",
    "they find a log - linear slope of @xmath238 .",
    "we have performed log - quadratic fits to this updated sample , and show the results in figure  [ fig14 ] . in the upper left panel",
    "we show the sample of 25 smbhs with resolved spheres of influence , and the corresponding best - fit relation . in the upper right - hand panel",
    "we show the 1 , 1.5 , 2 and 2.5-sigma error ellipsoids of @xmath5 and @xmath6 for this sample .",
    "this sample prefers a log - quadratic relation , with the log - linear relation lying near the @xmath239 contour .",
    "the grey regions in figure  [ fig14 ] represent the 1-sigma range for @xmath5 determined by ferrarese & ford  ( 2004 ) .",
    "we see that the contours of @xmath46 intercept the @xmath71 line over a range of slope described by the log - linear solution .    of the 5 galaxies with reliable mass - estimates , but unresolved spheres of influence in table  ii of ferrarese & ford  ( 2004 ) ,",
    "4 have had their stellar kinematical data modeled using both high - resolution spaced based data , and lower resolution ground based data ( gebhardt et al .",
    "gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that while higher resolution imaging led to a more precise determination , there was no systematic trend of the best fit values .",
    "we therefore repeat the above analysis with the inclusion of the 5 galaxies and show the results in the lower row of figure  [ fig14 ] .",
    "the additional 5 galaxies only change the slope @xmath5 of a log - linear fit by a small amount ( significantly less than the error bar ) .",
    "moreover , these 5 smbh masses are evenly spread about the best - fit relation , indicating that there is no systematic bias due to their spheres of influence not being resolved .",
    "however the inclusion of these galaxies significantly increases the significance of a log - quadratic term in the @xmath31 relation ."
