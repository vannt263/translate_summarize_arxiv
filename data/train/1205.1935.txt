    "divergence - free vector fields occur naturally in incompressible fluid dynamics , and preservation of phase - space volume is also a crucial ingredient in many , if not all , ergodic theorems .",
    "preservation of volume by a numerical method for differential equations is thus a desirable property in the study of dynamical system .",
    "nevertheless , designing volume preserving numerical integrators is a hard task , as the space of divergence - free vector fields seems to be too large .",
    "@xcite proved that no standard numerical method , for example a runge  kutta scheme , is volume preserving for all such vector fields .",
    "thus , the design of efficient methods that preserve volume is still a standing open problem in geometric integration @xcite .    despite no - go",
    "theorems for volume preservation within the class of `` standard '' methods ( see also the recent results in @xcite , @xcite , where it is proved that no b - series method can be volume preserving for all possible divergence - free vector fields ) , it is known that volume preservation can be achieved , either restricting the class of vector fields or using methods other than b - series . @xcite",
    "have shown that volume - preserving b - series can be obtained if the vector field has some specific dependence ( for example @xmath0 , or if the variables naturally decompose into two sets , @xmath1^t $ ] , obeying @xmath2 ) .",
    "these two examples of vector fields correspond to what we call _ off - diagonal_. these are generally easier to treat and other methods will be described in the sequel .",
    "volume - preserving maps can be constructed techniques other than methods that possess b - series , for instance using generating functions @xcite .",
    "this technique involves evaluating definite integrals of the vector field , and , in addition , the method does not preserve fixed points . another technique is based on splitting methods .",
    "one of the earliest volume - preserving splitting methods is indeed the splitting method by @xcite , decomposing the vector field into the sum of essentially 2-dimensional hamiltonian fields , which are then solved by a ( typically implicit ) symplectic method .    because of the difficulty of addressing the general space of divergence - free vector fields , recent efforts have concentrated to smaller , yet still interesting , functions spaces , for instance the space of polynomial fields",
    ". an earlier paper on splitting polynomial vector fields is by @xcite .",
    "that paper had some discussion of the divergence - free case , but mainly dealt with the hamiltonian case .",
    "investigations of the hamiltonian case , which involves expressing a scalar polynomial of degree @xmath3 in @xmath4 variables as a sum of functions of fewer variables , have shown that good splitting methods exist , but that finding and analyzing them ( especially for general @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) is very difficult @xcite .",
    "the volume - preserving case , which involves @xmath4 polynomials subject to the divergence - free condition , is even harder , although there is a conjecture by @xcite that they can be expressed as a sum of @xmath5 shears , each a function of @xmath6 variables .",
    "the case of linear and quadratic divergence - free vector fields was studied in detail in @xcite , where several explicit volume - preserving splitting methods were introduced . in that paper ,",
    "two main classes of methods were considered : a ) methods that distinguish the diagonal and off - diagonal part and b ) methods that do not . by diagonal part",
    "we mean all the terms of the vector field such that @xmath7 depends on @xmath8 , for @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , the off - diagonal part refers to all the terms of the vector field such that @xmath7 does not depend on @xmath8 , @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , for the class a ) , several explicit schemes that treated the diagonal part and the off - diagonal part separately were introduced and tested numerically .",
    "numerical tests indicated that methods that treated the diagonal part by splitting it in terms treated by exponentials had a smaller error than methods splitting in shears .",
    "in this paper we present a new approach that allows us to develop explicit volume - preserving methods for arbitrary polynomial divergence - free vector fields , including those with negative degree . the first main insight is to expand the divergence equation , rather than the vector field , in the monomial basis . for each monomial basis element",
    ", we identify the elements in the vector field associated to it to construct a divergence - free elementary vector field .",
    "the second insight is to recognize that the elementary divergence - free vector fields can all be treated by the same formalism and therefore can be solved explicitly by elementary analytical methods .",
    "the split fields are then composed to obtain explicit first order method and second order method ( by symmetrization ) .",
    "the resulting composition method is thus explicit and volume - preserving .",
    "being explicit , the proposed method are computationally efficient and possess excellent qualitative properties .",
    "we believe that thisis a consequence of volume preservation solely , as the methods are not necessarily time - reversible nor self - adjoint ( for instance , the first order method is neither ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : background ]",
    "we review some background and introduce notation . in section  [ sec : hom ] we present the monomial basis for polynomial volume - preserving vector fields and prove that the vector fields associated to the basis elements can be integrated exactly .",
    "the case of polynomials of negative degree is treated in section  [ sec : laurent ] . in section  [ sec : num ] we test the application to volume - preserving cubic stokes flows .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to some concluding remarks and some directions for future research .",
    "we consider the ordinary differential equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14^t$ ] , is subject to the divergence - free condition @xmath15 an arbitrary vector field @xmath16 can always be decomposed as @xmath17 where , component - wise , @xmath18 is the collection of terms in @xmath19 that depend on @xmath8 ( i.e.  @xmath20 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath21 , is given , component - wise , by the collection of terms in @xmath22 that do not depend on @xmath8 , i.e.  @xmath23 .",
    "we refer to @xmath24 and @xmath21 as the _ diagonal part _ and the _ off - diagonal _ part of the vector field @xmath25 , respectively .    from the definition of divergence ,",
    "it is clear that only the coefficients of the diagonal part are directly involved in the divergence - free condition , therefore , vector fields with zero diagonal part are automatically divergence - free .",
    "the off - diagonal part of a vector field is generally easier to treat by volume - preserving methods .",
    "the method of splitting in canonical @xmath4-shears is generic ( for each @xmath26 , we solve for @xmath27 , while @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . for polynomial systems",
    ", it is possible to construct splittings in lower - triangular systems ( for each @xmath26 , we solve for @xmath27 depending only on @xmath30 , under a suitable permutation of the indices ) , see @xcite .",
    "thus , to obtain volume - preserving methods , special care has to be taken when splitting the diagonal part , because splitting across the conditions for zero - divergence will yield methods that are not volume - preserving .",
    "the goal is to split the diagonal part in divergence - free vector fields that can be solved exactly .",
    "these observations motivate the following assumption .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will assume that the given vector field is _ diagonal _ only ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) and that the off - diagonal part is zero ( @xmath32 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case when the functions @xmath19 are polynomials . to treat the general case with @xmath4 variables and given degree @xmath3 , it is convenient to introduce a multi - index notation .",
    "let @xmath33 be a multi - index and let @xmath34 ( monomial ) .",
    "in addition , denote by @xmath35 the degree of the monomial .",
    "earlier studies of splitting methods for polynomial fields have focussed on homogeneous polynomials .",
    "assume that the @xmath19 are homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath3 in the variables @xmath36 , i.e.@xmath37 the case when @xmath19 is not homogeneous is easily treated by a further splitting in homogeneous terms .",
    "define @xmath38 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that @xmath39 is the number of coefficients @xmath40 ( for a fixed value of @xmath41 ) of an homogeneous polynomial @xmath22 of degree @xmath3 in @xmath4 variables .",
    "the divergence - free condition is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath42 because of derivation .",
    "all the coefficients of this polynomial must be identically equal to zero , because of the arbitrariness of the variables .",
    "this gives @xmath43 conditions for volume preservation . in the polynomial case ,",
    "there are @xmath43 divergence - free conditions on the coefficients . in order to be volume preserving ,",
    "a splitting must satisfy one or more conditions on the coefficients .",
    "our approach is inspired in part from that argument .",
    "the new idea is to consider a polynomial vector field and to look at a monomial - basis expansion of the divergence function .",
    "each basis element will correspond exactly is associated to a condition on the coefficients of the vector field .",
    "as long as we split according to basis terms , we are guaranteed to obtain `` elementary '' monomial fields that are also divergence free .",
    "we show that all these `` elementary divergence - free vector fields '' possess @xmath6 integrals in evolution and are therefore integrable .",
    "furthermore , we give the explicit analytical solution .",
    "this allows us to generate splitting methods for arbitrary divergence - free polynomial fields .",
    "we illustrate the general idea by discussing a simple 2-dimensional example .",
    "consider the vector field @xmath44 the divergence of this vector field is @xmath45 the divergence free condition becomes the set of equations @xmath46 as argued above , for each equation we obtain a divergence - free split vector fields @xmath47 surely , each of these vector fields can be integrated .",
    "for instance , in the first vector field , one can solve for @xmath48 then substitute into the second equation to solve for @xmath49 . in the third vector field ,",
    "the procedure is similar , just interchange the role of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the second vector field can also be integrated , though not exactly by the same method .",
    "the situation becomes far more complicated for several variables and higher order polynomial vector fields , so that , at first glance , this procedure does not yield a method that can be easily generalized .",
    "however , observe that the three vector fields can be written as @xmath50 i.e.   each vector field obeys an equation of the type @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the first , the second and third monomial in @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath54 is known , @xmath8 can be obtained by integration .    in what follows",
    ", we shall see that this argument is generic : it yields for any number of variables and any degree of the vector field .",
    "we shall therefore identify monomials appearing in the divergence - free condition and solve for them explicitly .",
    "when the monomials , as function of time , are known , the remaining variables follow by integration of linear equations with variable coefficients .",
    "consider a polynomial vector field @xmath55 of degree @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that this polynomial field is _ diagonal _ in the sense described earlier .",
    "diagonality implies some ( mild ) restrictions on the nonzero coefficients of , namely that , for a given index @xmath56 , one has @xmath57 provided that @xmath58 .    rather than looking at the vector fields ,",
    "it is useful to focus on the divergence polynomial and reconstruct the vector field from the divergence .    consider the ( diagonal ) polynomial vector field .",

    "the polynomial field is divergence free .",
    "moreover , can be uniquely split in sum of vector fields of the form .    since monomials are basis for the set of polynomials of degree @xmath3 , zero - divergence of implies that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the coefficient of @xmath68 in the divergence polynomial .",
    "for any multi - index @xmath60 , a contribution to the coefficient @xmath67 comes from @xmath69 , for each @xmath70 . if the @xmath71 are polynomials , such a term originates from derivation of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to the term @xmath73 in @xmath19 .",
    "this procedure picks up all the terms in @xmath19 contributing to @xmath67 and the condition @xmath74 guarantees that is divergence free .",
    "the uniqueness comes from the fact that @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , i.e.  @xmath77 is an arbitrary function of the remaining variables and does not contribute to the diagonal part of the vector field .    in the sequel",
    ", we will often use the short - hand notation @xmath78 for .",
    "each of these divergence - free vector fields is associated to a monomial basis element , and will be called an _ elementary divergence - free vector field _ ( in short , edfvf ) .",
    "without loss of generality , we can consider a edfvf @xmath79 of the form @xmath80 ( for simplicity , we have dropped the dependence of @xmath81 on the actual index @xmath60 ) . the divergence free condition amounts to the algebraic relation @xmath82    [ th : integrability ] the function @xmath83 is an integral of the edfvf .",

    "an upper bound on the step size can be obtained by prop  [ th : dcase ] . beware that this bound can be unrealistic for long time numerical integration and further step size restriction might occur , especially if the solution is unbounded , which is often the case of divergence - free vector fields and and high degrees of nonlinearity .",
    "these problems are harder to integrate and most numerical methods will require step size reduction for stability .    to conclude ,",
    "let us sketch out a possible way to attach the problem of volume - preserving integration for generic functions : let @xmath253 a set of basis functions . consider the decomposition @xmath254 in the given basis .",

    "thus , as long as we are able to recover all the terms in the given vector field contributing to the coefficient @xmath256 , we will automatically have a volume - preserving split vector field .",
