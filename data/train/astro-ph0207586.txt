    "observations of photons emitted by the various rotational transitions of the ground vibrational state of carbon monoxide ( co ) are the primary means of studying molecular gas in the galaxy .",
    "these spectral lines occur at frequencies of @xmath12 , for the transition from the @xmath13 to the @xmath14 rotational state .",
    "numerous galactic surveys ( combes 1991 ) have studied the lowest - frequency @xmath15 line . the brightness of this spectral line is roughly proportional to the total molecular column density within the telescope beam ( liszt 1984 ) , provided that the molecular gas has a relatively low density ( @xmath16 ) and column density ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "surveys of the @xmath15 line therefore give an indication of the extent and distribution of molecular material .",
    "a more complete picture of the thermodynamic state of the molecular gas can be gained through observations of other , higher-@xmath13 transitions of co and the various rotational transitions of the isotopically - substituted species @xmath18co and c@xmath19o .",
    "if the brightness of several of these lines is known , models of the excitation and radiative transfer can be used to solve for the density , temperature , and cooling rate of the molecular gas . to avoid degeneracy in this solution ,",
    "it is valuable to have observations of a line transition from a @xmath13-state that is sufficiently high in energy such that it is only weakly populated .",
    "co in interstellar molecular gas is typically in a thermodynamic state where the low-@xmath13 transitions are in approximate thermal equilibrium , so that all of the rotational transitions below some @xmath13-level have roughly the same excitation temperature as the @xmath15 transition .",
    "the observable quantity that is usually compared with theory is the ratio of line brightnesses .",
    "if only low-@xmath13 lines are observed , it is found that the ratio of these line brightnesses are only weakly dependent on excitation temperature and that maps of all the low-@xmath13 transitions look similar , regardless of variations in excitation temperature across the map .",
    "if , however , we observe a transition from a high-@xmath13 level that is not strongly excited , it will be found that the line brightness ratios involving that transition do vary significantly across the map , and the value of the excitation temperature can be more readily determined .",
    "previous observations with the ast / ro telescope ( see figure 1 ) have shown that the distribution of the co @xmath20 line emission is remarkably similar to that of the co @xmath15 line throughout the galactic center region .",
    "previous observations of co @xmath21 ( harris et al .",
    "1985 ) showed that line to be unusually bright within @xmath22 of the galactic center . in this paper , we report observations of the co @xmath23 and @xmath24 transitions in a strip map several degrees in extent , and find that the @xmath25 line has significantly lower brightness temperature and significantly different spatial distribution than the lower-@xmath13 co lines .",
    "we can therefore produce a new model of the thermodynamic state of the co gas along this 1-dimensional strip .",
    "these observations were made from 21 to 25 july 2000 with the antarctic submillimeter telescope and remote observatory ( ast / ro ) , located at amundsen - scott south pole station .",
    "ast / ro is a 1.7  m diameter , offset gregorian telescope capable of observing at wavelengths between 200  @xmath26 m and 1.3  mm ( stark et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the facility dual - channel sis waveguide receiver ( walker et al . 1992 ; honingh et al .",
    "1997 ) was used in position - switching mode . emission from the 806.6517  ghz @xmath23 transition of @xmath2co was mapped at @xmath27 = 0@xmath28 , 3.5@xmath291.5@xmath28 with 1@xmath30 spacing and a beam size of @xmath6 .",
    "the 461.041  ghz @xmath20 transition of @xmath2co was observed simultaneously , with a beam size of @xmath7 . the atmosphere - corrected system temperature during the observations ranged from 12,000 to 26,000  k at 806  ghz and from 3000 to 4000  k at 461  ghz .",
    "observing time at each of the 304 observed positions was typically 7 minutes .",
    "the intermediate frequency output of each receiver was connected to one of two acousto - optical spectrometers ( schieder , tolls , and winnewisser 1989 ) of which @xmath31 1-mhz - wide channels were in use at 806  ghz and @xmath32 1-mhz - wide channels were in use at 461  ghz .",
    "this configuration provided a velocity range of 225 km  s@xmath33  at 806  ghz and 438 km  s@xmath33  at 461  ghz .",
    "the channel spacing of 0.67  mhz corresponds to a velocity resolution of 0.37 km  s@xmath33  at 806  ghz and 0.65 km  s@xmath33  at 461  ghz .",
    "the high frequency observations were made with the co @xmath23 line in the lower sideband ( lsb ) . since the intermediate frequency of the ast /",
    "ro system is 1.5  ghz , the @xmath34 line of [ ci ] at 809.34197  ghz appears in the upper sideband and is superposed on the observed lsb spectrum .",
    "the local oscillator frequency was chosen so that the nominal line centers appear separated by @xmath35100 km  s@xmath33  in the double - sideband spectra .",
    "velocity increases with spectrometer channel number in opposite directions for the two sidebands ; in figure 4 , for example , velocity increases to the left for the [ ci ] line and to the right for the co. there is 809  ghz [ ci ] emission superposed on the 806  ghz co @xmath23 data at most positions where the @xmath23 line is strong . the central channel of the spectrometer was shifted for observations at negative longitudes so that the limited bandpass covered most of the velocity range of known low-@xmath13 emission .    during the time these observations were made , the ast / ro automated calibration system ( stark et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) was broken , so that we were not able to make automated sky or receiver measurements .",
    "we did , however , make manual measurements once a day .",
    "these show that the receiver gain and noise were stable within a few percent throughout the period of the observations . to determine the atmospheric opacity and sky temperature , we used data from the nrao - cmu @xmath36 tipper in operation at the south pole . several times each hour",
    ", this instrument makes a calibrated skydip using a broadband room - temperature bolometer . during the subsequent observing season ,",
    "when the automated calibration system was working , it was determined that the opacity in the narrow 806  ghz band is related to the opacity measured by the nrao - cmu tipper through the relation ( r. a. chamberlin , private communication ) : @xmath37 the relation used to calibrate the 461 ghz data was ( chamberlin 2001 ) : @xmath38 we used these relations , together with the nrao - cmu tipper data and thermometer measurements of the outside ambient temperature , to calculate the @xmath39 value we would have gotten if the automated calibration system had been working .",
    "these values were edited into a copy of the data file , allowing the data to be treated normally by our data reduction program , _ comb _ , as described in stark et al .",
    "longitude - velocity maps of the @xmath2co @xmath20 and @xmath23 distributions are shown in figure 2 . as can be seen by reference to the @xmath40 maps in figure 1 , the strip maps at @xmath41 shown in figure 2 skirt the outer regions of the strongest co features , rather than passing through their peak positions .",
    "nonetheless , the co @xmath23 emission is concentrated in the sgr  b and sgr  a complexes at velocities between 0 and + 100 km  s@xmath33 .",
    "emission features at negative velocities in figure 2b are contributed by superposed 809  ghz @xmath34 [ ci ] emission from the upper sideband ( see  2 ) .    for comparison , longitude - velocity maps of the @xmath2co @xmath15 , @xmath18co @xmath42 , and cs @xmath43 data described by stark et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and bally et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1988 ) are shown in figure 3 .",
    "again , it is seen that the low-@xmath13 rotational transitions are broadly and similarly distributed , while the co @xmath44 emission is much more spatially confined .",
    "a direct superposition of the @xmath2co @xmath20 and @xmath23 maps is shown in figure 4 , along with sample spectra at several positions .",
    "figure 5 shows maps of @xmath2co @xmath23 to @xmath2co @xmath20 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath2co @xmath15 to @xmath18co @xmath15 ( @xmath46 ) line brightness temperature ratios as a function of longitude and velocity in the galactic center region .",
    "the data were all convolved to the resolution of the @xmath2co @xmath47 map .",
    "the data in this figure fall into three categories : ( 1 ) regions where the signal - to - noise ratio is high for both the numerator and the denominator , ( 2 ) regions where the signal - to - noise ratio is low for the numerator but high for the denominator , and ( 3 ) regions where the signal - to - noise ratio is low for both the numerator and denominator .",
    "the fourth possibility , where the signal - to - noise ratio is high for the numerator but low for the denominator , is avoided by placing the higher signal - to - noise data in the denominator .",
    "category 1 data appear as smooth blue , green , yellow , orange , or white areas of the map . in these regions ,",
    "the temperature ratio is well - determined , and has a fractional error only a little larger than that of the temperature data constituting the numerator .",
    "category 2 data appear as mottled black and blue , since the value of the numerator is small and dominated by noise , while the denominator is some well - determined number ( [ zero @xmath48 noise]/[number ] ) ; the values of the ratio in these regions are near zero , with large fractional error .",
    "category 3 data have a `` salt and pepper '' black and white appearance as the ratio varies wildly over all possible values , both positive and negative , since both the numerator and denominator have noisy values near zero .",
    "both the value of the ratio and its error are large . in the upper panel of figure 5",
    ", category 1 data can be found in the vicinity of sgr a and sgr b ; category 2 data is found between sgr a and sgr b and to the left of sgr b ; category 3 data occupies the periphery of the figure .",
    "typical values of @xmath49 at points near sgr  a. at positions on the strip near sgr  b , typical values are higher : @xmath50 , over the velocity range 50 to 85 km  s@xmath33  .",
    "average line temperature ratios near sgr  a and sgr  b are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the value of @xmath51 near sgr  b is a factor of two higher than the ratio observed in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy m82 ( mao et al .",
    "figure 5 shows that aside from the regions near sgr  a and sgr  b , @xmath52 in the region bounded roughly by @xmath53 and @xmath5410  km  s@xmath33 @xmath55 110  km  s@xmath33 .",
    "this is the area that shows significant cs @xmath43 emission in figure 3 and is the area that binney et al .",
    "( 1991 ) identify with @xmath56 orbits in the galactic bulge .",
    "the 300 parsec ring is the rough parallelogram - shape between @xmath57=@xmath541@xmath28 and @xmath57=1.8@xmath28 , and velocities from @xmath54200 to @xmath58200 km  s@xmath33 .",
    "the clump 2 molecular cloud complex is located near @xmath57=3@xmath28 , at velocities from @xmath5820 to @xmath58150 km  s@xmath33  .",
    "both these regions show @xmath59 .      using the line ratios",
    ", we can estimate the kinetic temperature , @xmath60 , and the number density of molecular hydrogen , @xmath61 , through a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) radiative transfer analysis ( goldreich & kwan 1974 ) .",
    "the lvg approximation simplifies radiative transfer by the assumption that an emitted spectral line photon can only be absorbed `` locally '' , within a small region whose velocity is similar to the point of emission .",
    "this approximation is robust , in the sense that the results of lvg models are often reasonably accurate , even when reality violates the assumptions underlying the models ( ossenkopf 1997 ) .",
    "our lvg radiative transfer code simulates a plane - parallel cloud geometry .",
    "it uses the co collisional rates from turner ( 1995 ) and newly - derived values for the h@xmath62 ortho - to - para ratio ( @xmath63 2 ) and the collisional quenching rate of co by h@xmath62 impact ( yan , balakrishnan , & dalgarno , in preparation ) .",
    "the model has two input parameters : the ratio of @xmath2co to @xmath18co abundance , and the ratio @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the fractional co abundance parameter and @xmath66 denotes the velocity gradient .",
    "the abundance ratio @xmath2co/@xmath18co is taken to be 25 in the galactic center region ( langer & penzias 1990 , 1993 ) .",
    "we take @xmath67 , assuming that the @xmath2co / h@xmath62 ratio is 10@xmath68 and the velocity gradient of galactic center clouds is typically 3 to 6 km s@xmath33pc@xmath33 ( dahmen",
    "et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the line ratios for the lvg analysis and the physical parameters derived are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the solution of the radiative transfer equation gives @xmath45 and @xmath46 as a function of the total molecular hydrogen volume density for different values of the gas kinetic temperature , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "for each observed point , we can invert these functions to determine the kinetic temperature and molecular hydrogen volume density corresponding to the observed line ratios .",
    "the lvg model shows the variation of kinetic temperature across the galactic center region .",
    "sgr  b , with @xmath69 0.6 , has a kinetic temperature of 72 ( @xmath482 ) k , the highest kinetic temperature among the galactic center molecular clouds on our strip map .",
    "this derived kinetic temperature is consistent with the rotational temperature derived from the nh@xmath70(j , k)=(3,3 ) @xmath71 ( 1,1 ) data ( morris 1989 ) and @xmath18co @xmath15 survey ( oka et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the kinetic temperature at the position nearest sgr  a is 47 ( @xmath72 ) k , lower than sgr  b. if we exclude these two regions , we find that the mean kinetic temperatures is @xmath3535 @xmath73 k within the inner 500 parsecs of the galaxy . in comparison , the dust temperatures in the inner 200 pc are @xmath3521@xmath482 k ( pierce - price et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the observed line intensities of co @xmath42 , @xmath74 , and @xmath44 lines , together with the lvg values for the kinetic temperature , allow us to estimate the column densities of all the @xmath13-states of co. the co @xmath75 line is the most luminous co transition from the sgr  a complex , whereas the @xmath76 line is the most luminous co transition from the sgr  b complex .",
    "adopting diameters of 45 pc for sgr  b and 30 pc for sgr  a from inspection of @xmath18co and cs maps ( bally et al . 1987 ) , and assuming uniform thermodynamic properties within those volumes , we can estimate the properties of those clouds as a whole .",
