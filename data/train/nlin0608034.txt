    "the progress of chemical or biological processes mixed by fluid flows is of great environmental and industrial significance , in a wide variety of contexts ( see  @xcite for some broad applications ; in this paper we shall , for brevity , mostly use the language of chemical processes in our discussions ) .",
    "the underlying processes often possess multiple possible long - time states , characterized by whether some reaction proceeds or dies out .",
    "the ultimate fate of a localized initial disturbance can depend subtly on the combined influences of advection by the fluid , diffusion of the reactants , and the reaction kinetics .",
    "this paper concerns the influence of chaotic , laminar fluid mixing on the course of a bistable chemical reaction in a closed flow domain . in a spatially homogeneous environment",
    ", such a reaction tends to one of two steady states ( which we describe below as the `` quenched '' and `` excited '' states ) according to whether or not the initial reactant concentrations exceed some threshold .",
    "however , the large - time behavior of the reaction from a spatially localized disturbance subject to fluid mixing is a more subtle question , since the mixing has two competing effects on the course of the reaction . on the one hand ,",
    "the mixing promotes the chemical reaction , since , according to the kinematics of the fluid motion , interfaces are exponentially stretched",
    ". however , the mixing also tends to suppress the reaction , since the repeated stretching and folding that is characteristic of chaotic flows generates a complicated filamentary pattern ; if the thinning of the filaments is sufficiently rapid , it may ultimately quench the reaction , through diffusive dilution of the reactants .",
    "the loss of a stable excited state as the mixing grows in strength ( or as the reaction rate is reduced ) may be viewed as a saddle  node bifurcation , and has been identified in a number of reaction schemes  @xcite . for example , neufeld et al .",
    "@xcite note that for both bistable and autocatalytic reactions there are two regimes : when mixing is slow , localized excited perturbations propagate throughout a closed domain ; by contrast , under rapid mixing , localized perturbations decay to the uniform quenched state . in the propagative case , perturbations spread in the form of filaments . for an excitable medium , neufeld",
    "@xcite describe three scenarios for a closed flow : in the first , there is eventually a global excitation , which is spatially incoherent , so different parts of the domain are excited at different times ; in the second , there is again a global excitation , but this time it is spatially coherent , and ultimately the system homogeneously decays to the unexcited state ; in the third , the excitation enjoys no significant propagation before its ultimate decay .",
    "kiss et al .",
    "@xcite investigate a chemical reaction scheme capable of supporting both steady and oscillatory homogeneous states , subject to chaotic mixing .",
    "they find that ultimately the system reaches a spatially homogeneous state , which may be of either steady or oscillatory type , depending on the parameters .",
    "we shall show here the existence of a third regime  beyond the global quenched and excited states  comprising a persistent localized disturbance .",
    "for definiteness , we consider the model bistable reaction scheme in which a chemical concentration @xmath0 satisfies , in dimensionless form , @xmath1 where @xmath2  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath3 is the pclet number , @xmath4 is the damkhler number and @xmath5 is the dimensionless fluid velocity ( here @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are scales for the fluid velocity , lengths and chemical concentrations , respectively ; @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath10 is the reaction constant ) . in view of the need to carry out",
    "well resolved simulations at moderately high pclet number , we shall consider a two - dimensional problem , in which @xmath11 is the so - called `` sine flow ''  @xcite .",
    "this choice of flow permits a particularly efficient and accurate spectral numerical solution of the problem  @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the behavior of ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) .",
    "first consider the reaction in the spatially homogeneous case .",
    "then if the initial value of @xmath12 exceeds the threshold @xmath13 , @xmath14 at large times .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath12 is initially less than the threshold , then @xmath15 at large times .",
    "we expect a similar scenario to hold in ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) if the initial state is nonhomogeneous , but the mixing is sufficiently rapid : an initial state is first rapidly averaged in space , then the long - time behavior of the system depends on whether or not , in this averaged ( nearly spatially homogeneous ) state , @xmath12 exceeds @xmath13 . in the opposite limit of no fluid motion , an initial localized disturbance spreads or",
    "becomes extinct depending on the initial state , but if the disturbance takes the form @xmath16 ( a constant ) in some finite region @xmath17 , and @xmath18 outside @xmath17 , then the condition for the disturbance to spread is roughly that @xmath19 should exceed @xmath13 .",
    "we expect a similar scenario for slow fluid mixing .",
    "these considerations , and the results of refs .  , suggest that , in a closed flow , the fate of a localized disturbance in ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) is as follows : the system tends to a uniform state at large time , with @xmath20 ( for sufficiently rapid mixing or slow reaction or weak initial perturbation ) or @xmath21 ( for sufficiently slow mixing or rapid reaction ) .",
    "furthermore , given an initial disturbance that leads to the latter globally excited state for given values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , one would expect that a sufficient reduction in @xmath22 would cause the reaction to proceed instead to the quenched state .",
    "however , we show here that there is an additional , intermediate scenario , in which the perturbation appears to remain localized for all time , spread along a segment of the unstable manifold of an unstable periodic orbit of the flow .",
    "we investigate this localized state through numerical simulation of ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) , in particular exploring its dependence on damkhler and pclet numbers , and on the initial state .",
    "finally , we shed some limited analytical light by consideration of a reduced , lamellar model that represents the balance between spreading of the hotspot due to reaction and diffusion , and compressive effects of the flow .",
    "in this section we describe some numerical simulations of ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) .",
    "stirring of the fluid is accomplished by the `` sine flow '' , which is time - periodic with period @xmath24 ; then  @xcite @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the simulations take place in a doubly periodic square box @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the `` globally chaotic '' case @xmath28 , for which the poincar section appears to the eye to have no significant regular islands .",
    "the initial condition is given by the gaussian concentration profile @xmath29 ,   \\label{eq : ic}\\ ] ] for @xmath30 , so that the initial spatially averaged concentration is @xmath31 at @xmath32 .",
    "in most simulations , @xmath33 , although we also briefly consider other values of @xmath34 , in the range @xmath35 . the choice to center the initial disturbance on the point @xmath36 was arbitrary , but , as we shall see , it proves serendipitous .",
    "we simulate ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) subject to the flow field ( [ eq : sfu ] ) and the initial state ( [ eq : ic ] ) using a pseudospectral code , which is described in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the pclet number in our simulations is limited to @xmath37 , to ensure well resolved results with our available computational resources .",
    "most simulations up to @xmath38 are carried out using 512 fourier modes in each of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions , and a time step of @xmath41 ; unlike the simulations reported elsewhere  @xcite , which exclusively use the second - order time - stepping scheme etdrk2 , we mostly use here the fourth - order scheme etdrk4 ( see ref .   for details of these two schemes ) .    in all the numerical simulations below ,",
    "the sine flow is fixed to have period @xmath28 , in order to avoid the appearance and disappearance of regular islands with varying @xmath24 .",
    "thus our investigation of the effects of fluid _ mixing _ is carried out by varying the pclet number ( smaller and larger values of this parameter corresponding , respectively , to more rapid and slower mixing ) .",
    "we also investigate the influence of the reaction rate and the initial amount of @xmath12 upon the long - time behavior of the system through varying the damkhler number @xmath22 and @xmath34 , respectively .      in all our simulations , we set @xmath42 .",
    "thus for sufficiently rapid mixing the reaction is quenched ( since the initial averaged concentration @xmath43 ) , and for slow enough mixing the disturbance spreads throughout the domain ( since the peak initial concentration @xmath44 ) .",

    "we find that at @xmath38 , as we have described above , the relatively rapid mixing quenches the reaction , so that @xmath15 everywhere . at @xmath81 and at @xmath59 , by contrast , the mixing is slower , and we again find a persistent hotspot . if we accept the qualitative picture above , that the width of the hotspot is determined by a balance between compression and reaction  diffusion , while its length is determined by mixing in the bulk then the width should scale as @xmath82 for large @xmath23 , and the length should remain roughly independent of @xmath23 .",

    "unfortunately we are unable to simulate reliably beyond @xmath59 , so we are unable to confirm this prediction .",
    "there has recently @xcite been significant progress in understanding the dynamics of reaction  advection  diffusion problems such as ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) by analysing reduced `` filamental '' or `` lamellar '' models  @xcite , which concern the simpler problem of the evolution of the reaction in a one - dimensional setting , in our case @xmath87 here @xmath88 represents a coordinate in the compressive direction near an unstable periodic orbit of the sine flow .",
    "this is the `` lagrangian filament slice model '' , which has been thoroughly reviewed by tl et al .",
    "@xcite , largely , but not entirely , in the context of open rather than closed flows .",
    "this model might be expected to provide at least a partial picture of the behavior of the hotspot . to see this",
    ", we first note that the hotspot is a thin structure , which appears , from the two - dimensional numerical simulations of sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] , to be approximately concentrated around the unstable manifold of an unstable periodic orbit .",
    "thus we approximate the flow in the neighborhood of the orbit by its linearization .",
    "the key balance in determining the existence or otherwise of the hotspot is that between the compressive flow in the direction of the stable manifold ( represented by the term @xmath89 in ( [ gen_eqn ] ) ) and the tendency of the hotspot to spread as a reaction  diffusion front ( represented by the right - hand side of ( [ gen_eqn ] ) ) , and so we reduce consideration to one - dimensional variations along the stable manifold , and ignore variations along the unstable manifold .",
    "this remains a complicated model , and so we take the further gross liberty of assuming that the flow field along the stable manifold is time - independent , with a uniform and constant rate of compression @xmath90 . for example , for the period-6 orbit , the value of @xmath90 is chosen such that @xmath91 corresponds to the compressive eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix of the periodic orbit ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) .",
    "we are thus led to ( [ gen_eqn ] ) as a simplified one - dimensional model . since nontrivial solutions to ( [ gen_eqn ] )",
    "are localized around the origin , we may make the further simplification that the corresponding spatial domain is @xmath93 .",

    "]    let us now briefly recall some relevant known results for ( [ gen_eqn ] ) .",
    "an exact characterization of the behavior of a single reaction ",
    "diffusion front in ( [ gen_eqn ] ) is possible in the absence of the advection term @xmath89  @xcite : such a front between @xmath94 as @xmath95 and @xmath18 as @xmath96 moves with velocity @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , its profile is readily determined to be @xmath98\\right\\}^{-1}$ ] ( up to some shift in time or space origin ) , where @xmath99 .    in the presence of the advection term ,",
    "such an exact characterization of solutions to ( [ gen_eqn ] ) is no longer possible , although ( large-@xmath22 ) asymptotic and numerical treatments are available  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest in the present context is the behavior of solutions to ( [ gen_eqn ] ) on @xmath93 from localized initial disturbances , which is well documented  @xcite : if @xmath100 is less than some threshold @xmath101 then all initial states decay to @xmath20 ; however , if @xmath102 then an above - threshold initial state generally tends to a nontrivial , stable , steady localized state as @xmath47 .",
    "the transition at @xmath103 is a saddle  node bifurcation  @xcite . for @xmath42 , as in our two - dimensional simulations , we find this saddle - node bifurcation to be at @xmath104 ( by solving ( [ gen_eqn ] ) numerically and tracking the stable steady state as @xmath22 is reduced ) .",
    "since @xmath105 , we thus conclude that no hotspots should be possible in the two - dimensional simulations for @xmath106 .",
    "it is certainly the case that we have observed no hotspots for such small damkhler numbers ; indeed , the lowest damkhler number for which we _ have _ observed hotspots is @xmath107 . given the small sample of parameter space provided by our simulations and the gross assumptions made in arguing for ( [ gen_eqn ] ) , this seems to represent reasonable agreement between this model and the full simulations .",
    "further quantitative comparisons may be made by examining the structure of the hotspot itself . to this end ,",
    "[ fig : cs ] shows a cross - section of the concentration through the hotspot , from two - dimensional simulations of ( [ eq:3d_eqn ] ) and from the model ( [ gen_eqn ] ) .",
    "the general concentration profile is captured well by the model , although the hotspot itself is rather narrower than the one - dimensional model prediction .",
    "the one - dimensional model also predicts that only sufficiently wide gaussian initial conditions will generate a hotspot , for supercritical damkhler numbers  @xcite .",
    "this dependence upon the initial condition is qualitatively consistent with the full system , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : size ] .    of course , the one - dimensional model ( [ gen_eqn ] ) has only limited predictive power for the full two - dimensional system . while the saddle  node bifurcation of the model seems to capture the demise of the hotspot as the damkhler number",
    "is decreased , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pe4 ] , there is no mechanism in the model for global excitation ( instead the model predicts a hotspot whose width grows like @xmath108 for large @xmath22  @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "the model predicts behavior qualitatively consistent with the left - hand boundary of the hotspot region in fig .",
    "[ fig : par ] , but not the right - hand boundary . a further shortcoming of the model is that its dependence upon the pclet number can be removed by a straightforward scaling of @xmath88 , unlike the full two - dimensional problem . as a consequence ,",
    "the saddle  node bifurcation in ( [ gen_eqn ] ) is independent of @xmath23 and , for a given damkhler number , the stable steady - state solution simply becomes thinner as the pclet number is increased , with width proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "such behavior is in contrast to the precipitate loss of the hotspot illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : k6 ] for @xmath38 , and the left - hand boundary of the hotspot region in fig .",
    "[ fig : par ] .",
    "for a bistable chemical reaction mixed in a chaotic laminar fluid flow , we have demonstrated numerically localized states that seem to persist indefinitely . in a sweep of parameter space ,",
    "these localized states provide a case intermediate between global quenching and global excitation of the reaction , as the damkhler number is varied .",
    "they are associated with unstable an periodic orbit , and their existence may partially be understood in terms of a simple lamellar model .",
    "the long - time behavior of the system is strongly dependent on the size of the initial disturbance : too large or small and the system approaches , respectively , globally excited or quenched states ; only for initial disturbances of intermediate size can a hotspot be found .",
    "the broad influence of the damkhler number upon the long - time state of the system is straightforward to summarize : if we begin with parameter values that lead to a hotspot , then a sufficient increase or decrease in the damkhler number takes the system instead to the globally excited or quenched states .",
    "the influence of the pclet number is slightly more complicated . again",
    "suppose that we start with parameter values leading to a hotspot , and consider the effects of reducing the pclet number ( i.e. , enhancing diffusion ) . for lower reaction rates ( i.e. , smaller damkhler numbers )",
    ", we find that the enhanced initial smearing of a localized initial disturbance results ultimately in a globally quenched state .",
    "when the reaction rate is greater , however , the nascent hotspot is able to sustain itself even in the presence of the enhanced diffusive spreading , but is unable to remain localized when the pclet number is reduced sufficiently ; thus the system approaches the globally excited state .",
    "since we are unable accurately to simulate pclet numbers greater than approximately @xmath37 , any large - pclet number trends are inaccessible to our numerics .",
    "nevertheless , we conjecture that a hotspot generally persists as the pclet number is increased ( all other parameters being fixed ) , with the amount of chemical present scaling as @xmath82 . of course , an exception to this suggestion would arise if one chose an initial condition for which diffusion was essential in transporting enough of an initial patch of chemical to the vicinity of the periodic orbit upon which the hotspot would ultimately be attached .",
    "then it is possible that too large a pclet number would lead to insufficient material reaching the intended periodic orbit , and hence to a globally quenched state .",
    "our discovery of these `` hotspots '' resulted from a lucky choice of localized initial state , which happened to be centered close to an unstable period-6 orbit .",
    "however , since the initial disturbance lay in the chaotic region ( apart from regular islands too small to see in a poincar section of the flow ) the initial state must also have covered infinitely many other unstable periodic orbits , and we have no explanation for why one particular orbit should have been selected as the location of the hotspot .",
    "it seems likely that other choices of initial conditions and parameter regimes will lead to robust hotspots besides the period-6 orbit evidenced here .",
    "although we have demonstrated hotspots for a single specific model reaction scheme , we expect similar hotspots to be observable in other stirred multistable chemical reactions ( subject to sufficient luck or judgment in choosing the initial conditions and parameter values ) .",
    "finally , we note that the existence and indefinite coherence of the hotspots reported here is due to the periodic nature of the mixing flow @xmath11 . in a randomized sine flow , for example , in which the phase of the underlying shear flows is chosen randomly at each period , we would not expect a similar persistent phenomenon .",
    "the author is grateful to georg gottwald , predrag cvitanovi and alexander vikhansky for helpful discussions .",
    "most of the calculations reported here took place on the university of nottingham high performance computing grid ."
