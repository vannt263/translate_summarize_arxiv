    "<S> the long - time behavior of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) is investigated by the molecular dynamics simulation of a two - dimensional system which has both a many - body interaction and a random potential . with strengthening the random potential by increasing the density of impurities , a crossover behavior of the vacf </S>",
    "<S> is observed from a positive tail , which is proportional to @xmath0 , to a negative tail , proportional to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter tail exists even when the density of particles is the same order as the density of impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the vacf in a nonequilibrium steady state is also studied . in the linear response regime </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is similar to that in the equilibrium state , whereas it changes drastically in the nonlinear response regime .    </S>",
    "<S> transport coefficients are related to time integrals of the time correlation functions of appropriate quantities . </S>",
    "<S> sufficiently fast decay of the correlation functions is therefore necessary for convergence of the transport coefficients , and it had been expected that the correlation functions are exponentially decaying functions in time . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , certain systems in which correlation functions exhibit power - law decay at long times , which is called the long - time tail @xcite . in heat conduction systems such as nonlinear lattices , hard - core particles , and lennard - jones systems , the long - time tails of the autocorrelation functions of the heat flux and the resultant system - size dependence of the thermal conductivity have been observed numerically @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the long - time tails have also been observed for the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) of a moving particle , which determines the self - diffusion coefficient @xmath2 , in particle transport systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of such systems is the hard - core fluid where the long - time tail of the vacf is positive and proportional to @xmath3 ( which we call the fluid - type tail ) @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is the dimension of the system . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath2 is divergent in the two - dimensional fluid , which may be observed as logarithmic dependence of @xmath2 on the system size . </S>",
    "<S> another system is the lorentz model , which describes the motion of a single point particle in a disordered system where immobile scatterers are randomly arrayed . </S>",
    "<S> the long - time tail of the vacf in the lorentz model is known to be negative and proportional to @xmath5 ( which we call the lorentz - type tail ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although this tail does not lead to divergence of @xmath2 even for @xmath6 , it might induce a system - size dependent term in @xmath2 which decays only algebraically with increasing the system size .    although in the fluid system only a many - body interaction is present whereas in the lorentz model </S>",
    "<S> only a random potential ( which immobile scatterers generate ) is present , there are many physical systems which have both of them . </S>",
    "<S> a typical one of such systems is the electric conduction system , where interacting particles correspond to electrons and a random potential is generated by impurities and defects . </S>",
    "<S> at room temperature , two - dimensional electron systems in semiconductors are well described as two - dimensional _ classical _ systems because the room temperature is smaller than the quantum level spacing in the confining ( @xmath7 ) direction and larger than the fermi energy in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is widely known from experimental results that @xmath2 of such systems is well - defined , independent of the sample size , to a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> this fact suggests that the _ coexistence _ of a many - body interaction ( among electrons ) and a random potential would change the long - time behavior of the vacf from the above - mentioned theoretical results which assume existence of only _ either one _ of them .    in the present paper , using the model of a classical electric conduction system proposed by us </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we compute the vacf in a two - dimensional system which has both a random potential ( impurity scatterings ) and a many - body [ electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) ] interaction , and study how the long - time behavior of the vacf changes with varying the densities of impurities and electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the vacf in nonequilibrium steady states , and observe considerable changes in the nonlinear response regime .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we analyze the equilibrium state . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we use a simplified version of our model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of two types of classical hard disks in a two - dimensional square box , the linear size of which is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> one type , which we call impurity , is immobile . </S>",
    "<S> its radius and number density are denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the other type , which we call electron , moves freely till it collides with another electron or with an impurity . </S>",
    "<S> the mass , radius , and number density of the electrons are denoted by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can change the strength of the random potential and the frequency of _ e - e _ collisions by varying the values of @xmath12 and @xmath15 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the model without the impurities corresponds to the hard - disk fluid whereas the model without the _ e - e _ interaction corresponds to the ( non - overlapping ) lorentz model .    using the event - driven molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation , we study the long - time behavior of the vacf , @xmath16 , of an electron in an equilibrium state @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the data of the vacf shown below are computed as follows : first we calculate the vacf for each electrons and take the average over the electrons in the system for each configuration of the impurities . </S>",
    "<S> then we average the results over five configurations of the impurities . </S>",

    "<S> to see this fact more clearly , we compute the vacf for case ( ii ) , with @xmath12 fixed to 0.0434 and @xmath15 varied from @xmath40 ( i.e. , a single electron in the system , corresponding to the system without the _ e - e _ interaction ) to 0.0434 . in this case , the reduced impurity density is @xmath41 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> we show the numerical results of the vacf in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : i10000 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that at long times the vacf decays as @xmath1 at @xmath43 , which corresponds to the lorentz model , and that this lorentz - type tail also exists for larger values of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the lorentz - type tail appears even when @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : kaisu_i10000 ] ) .    according to the phenomenological approaches @xcite , the origin of the long - time tails is the coupling of hydrodynamic modes in the systems . in the fluid </S>",
    "<S> the conservation of both the momentum and particle number contributes to the hydrodynamic modes @xcite . in the lorentz model , by contrast , only the particle - number conservation contributes to the mode , which couples with the static mode generated by the configuration of the impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the absence of the interaction between particles ( the _ e - e _ interaction ) was assumed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 17 , our results suggest that a similar mode - coupling theory would be valid whether or not the interaction between particles is present if a system has the dynamical mode from particle - number conservation and some static modes couple with it .    according to this interpretation , the crossover of the long - time behavior from the fluid - type tail to the lorentz - type one with increasing @xmath12 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : e5000 ] ) would be explained as follows . to treat the electron system as a fluid </S>",
    "<S> , it is necessary that the _ e - e _ collisions occur more frequently than the _ e - i _ collisions . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath45 is a necessary condition for regarding the velocity field to be hydrodynamic , where @xmath46 is a crossover ratio of the collision frequencies , which would be almost independent of the densities and the system size . therefore , when @xmath47 both types of the long - time tails are present , and we observe the fluid - type one manifestly because it is stronger than the lorentz - type one . with increasing @xmath12 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 becomes smaller , and when @xmath49 the fluid - type tail disappears because the hydrodynamic description of the velocity field is not valid . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz - type tail , by contrast , survives even in this regime due to the particle - number conservation .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : e5000 ] the crossover takes place around @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus from the corresponding values of @xmath48 and @xmath30 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kaisu_e5000 ] , we evaluate @xmath51 to satisfy @xmath52 we can translate @xmath51 into the crossover value of the density ratio as @xmath53 if we assume the approximate relations @xmath54 and @xmath55 . here , @xmath56 is the thermal velocity of an electron , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the cross sections of the _ e - i _ and _ e - e _ scatterings , respectively . since @xmath59 for hard - disk interactions , eq .  ( [ m ] ) is translated as @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> . these values are consistent with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : e5000 ] ( where @xmath15 is fixed to @xmath61 ) , which shows the validity of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tau ] ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : i10000 ] ( @xmath62 ) , @xmath63 ranges from @xmath64 to @xmath65 in our calculation , which is smaller than @xmath66 . therefore , the fact that we have observed only the lorentz - type tail in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : i10000 ] is also consistent with the above interpretation .    </S>",

    "<S> right graphs : the absolute values of the vacf for steady states under various values of the electric field , plotted against @xmath24 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : e5000 ] and [ fig : i10000 ] , we have not shifted any of the data along the horizontal axes . ]    finally , let us examine the long - time tail of the vacf in nonequilibrium steady states . in order to realize a nonequilibrium steady state </S>",
    "<S> , we use our original model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in addition to the electrons and impurities there exist another type of moving disks ( which we call phonons ) in a rectangular box of size @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass and radius of the phonons are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . in the @xmath8-direction we apply an electric field @xmath73 to the electrons to induce the electric current , and </S>",
    "<S> the boundary condition in this direction is periodic . </S>",
    "<S> the boundaries in the @xmath9-direction are potential walls for the electrons , and thermal walls for the phonons , which simulate the heat transfer outside the system ( conductor ) to keep it in a steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between any pair of the disks is taken to be hertzian . </S>",
    "<S> the equations of motion are solved by the gear s predictor - corrector method . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> 21 and in the left graphs in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noneq ] ( in which the charge of an electron is set to be unity ) , this model has well - defined nonequilibrium steady states even in the nonlinear response regime . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the vacf defined by @xmath74 in a nonequilibrium steady state , where @xmath75 is the component of electron s velocity parallel to @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and fix the number densities of the electrons and phonons to be @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively . from the results for the equilibrium state ( @xmath80 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the crossover of the vacf with increasing @xmath12 is observed even when the phonons are present </S>",
    "<S> . then we compute and compare the vacfs in the equilibrium state , the linear response regime and the nonlinear response regime , for various values of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the right graphs in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noneq ] depict the results . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that in the linear response regime the behavior of the vacf is almost the same as in the equilibrium state . in the nonlinear response regime , by contrast , we observe drastic changes in the behavior . for @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> [ figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noneq](a ) and [ fig : noneq](b ) ] the fluid - type tail is enhanced as the electric field becomes larger . for @xmath82 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noneq](b ) ] in particular , although we can not observe the fluid - type tail clearly either in the equilibrium state or in the linear response regime , it appears manifestly in the nonlinear response regime . for @xmath83 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : noneq](c ) ] the lorentz - type tail appears from shorter times than in the equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> we think that this is partly because @xmath48 becomes shorter with increasing @xmath73 @xcite .    in summary , using the md simulation we have studied the long - time behavior of the vacf for interacting electrons in a two - dimensional disordered system . for the equilibrium state we have found that with increasing the density of the impurities the long - time tail crosses over from the positive tail proportional to @xmath0 ( the fluid - type tail ) to the negative tail proportional to @xmath1 ( the lorentz - type tail ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz - type tail survives even when we increase the density of the electrons up to the same order as that of the impurities . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that in our two - dimensional system the diffusion constant does not diverge in the limit of infinite system size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there may remain , however , a small term , which depends weakly ( algebraically ) on the system size . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that the crossover occurs when @xmath84 or @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .    for nonequilibrium steady states , although in the linear response regime the vacf behaves similarly to that in the equilibrium state , its behavior changes considerably in the nonlinear response regime . there </S>",
    "<S> the fluid - type tail is enhanced for smaller @xmath12 whereas the lorentz - type tail appears from earlier times for larger @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> we expect that these summarized results would be insensitive to details of the systems , and that elaborate experiments and a kinetic theory with two - parameter ( @xmath15 and @xmath12 ) density expansion would support our results . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our estimate of @xmath51 would be useful for analyzing not only the long tails but also other physical phenomena of many - particle systems because one can judge whether the system can be described as a fluid . </S>"
