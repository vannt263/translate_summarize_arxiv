    "more than twenty years ago yang and yang @xcite introduced in a series of seminal papers a technique which allows to compute thermodynamic quantities for a system of bosons interacting dynamically via factorizable scattering .",
    "this method was generalized less than ten years ago by al.b .",
    "zamolodchikov @xcite to a system of particles which interact dynamically in a relativistic manner through a scattering matrix which belongs to an integrable quantum field theory",
    ". this latter approach , usually referred to as thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) , has triggered numerous further investigations [ 3 - 13 ] .",
    "the reason for this activity is twofold , on one hand the tba serves as an interface between conformally invariant theories and massive integrable deformations of them and on the other hand it serves as a complementary approach to other methods .",
    "the tba - approach allows to extract various types of informations from a massive integrable quantum field theory once its scattering matrix is known .",
    "most easily one obtains the central charge @xmath0 of the virasoro algebra of the underlying ultraviolet conformal field theory , the conformal dimension @xmath1 and the factor of proportionality of the perturbing operator , the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 and other interesting quantities .",
    "thus , the tba provides a test laboratory in which certain conjectured scattering matrices may be probed for consistency .",
    "in addition , the tba is useful since it provides quantities which may be employed in other contexts , like the computation of correlation functions .",
    "for instance the constant of proportionality , the dimension of the perturbing field and @xmath3 may be used in a perturbative approach around the operator product expansion of a two point function within a conformal field theory @xcite . @xmath2",
    "may also be used as an initial value for the recursive system between different n - particle form factors @xcite .    in order to obtain data beyond @xmath0 one has to investigate the behaviour of the scaling function @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the inverse temperature times a mass scale ) , which may be viewed as the deformed central charge of the virasoro algebra .",
    "it will be the central aim of this manuscript to determine this function .",
    "certain statements in this context can be made in complete generality , but of course ultimately one has to specify some concrete models in order to be more explicit .",
    "an attractive choice for these models are affine toda field theories @xcite , since they cover a huge class of theories due to their lie algebraic formulation and permit therefore to extract many universal features .",
    "ultimately they also allow a comparison against standard perturbation theory in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "the first computation of such a scaling function was carried out in @xcite for the scaling lee - yang model and scaling 3-state potts model ( minimal @xmath6-affine toda field theory ) .",
    "meanwhile there exist several computations of this kind @xcite .",
    "the general behaviour one finds is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the effective central charge , with @xmath0 being the usual conformal anomaly , i.e. the central charge of the virasoro algebra , and @xmath9 the lowest conformal dimension of the underlying conformal field theory .",
    "the @xmath10 are some constants and typically @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "however , in @xcite a quite different behaviour was observed , namely that @xmath13 , which was attributed therein to zero mode fluctuations . it is this kind of behaviour which we find for all affine toda field theories ( see equn . ( [ universal ] ) )",
    "we like to stress that the constant @xmath14 should be different from zero .    in our investigation",
    "we slightly modify and generalize an approach which was introduced originally in @xcite .",
    "we also include in our analysis the possibility that the statistical interaction is of general haldane type @xcite and investigate the tba - equations adapted to this situation @xcite .",
    "we investigate in detail the expressions for the tba - kernels and their fourier transformed versions , from which we obtain a universal form for the relevant tba - equations .",
    "we derive the related y - systems .",
    "furthermore , we address the question of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the tba equations , derive error estimates and the rate of convergence for the numerical procedure applied .",
    "our analytical considerations culminate with the derivation of a general expression for the scaling function valid for all affine toda field theories in which the underlying lie algebra is simply laced ( [ universal ] ) and which depends in a universal manner only on the rank of the algebra , its coxeter number and the effective coupling constant .",
    "we compare the general formulae against the numerical solutions for several explicit models , i.e. for the @xmath15 and @xmath16-affine toda field theories .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in section 2 we recall the tba - equation for general haldane statistics and explain how it can be used to compute explicitly expressions for scaling functions . in section 3 we derive general expression for the approximated analytical expression for the solutions of the tba - equations and for the scaling functions @xmath4 . in section 4",
    "we concretely test our statements for a system involving the scattering matrix of affine toda field theories .",
    "we compare the general approximated analytical expression with the numerical solution for some explicit models . in section 5",
    "we address the question of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the tba equations and derive error estimates and the rate of convergence .",
    "we state our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we consider a multi - particle system involving @xmath17 different types of particles and assume that the two - particle scattering matrix @xmath18 ( as a function of the rapidity @xmath19 ) together with the corresponding mass spectrum ( @xmath20 is the mass of particle type @xmath21 ) have been determined .",
    "the @xmath17 coupled tba - equations which describe such a system , based on the assumption that the dynamical interaction is characterized by the scattering matrices @xmath18 and whose statistical interaction is governed by general haldane statistics @xcite @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . ] , read @xcite @xmath24 the scaling parameter @xmath5 is the inverse temperature times a mass scale and we denote as usual the convolution of two functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 by @xmath27 @xmath28 and the kernel by @xmath29 we recall the important fact that the functions @xmath30 are related to the ratio of densities @xmath31of particles inside the system over the densities of @xmath32 of available states as @xmath30 @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 , a property we will frequently appeal to . in addition we will make use of the fact that @xmath35 is an even function in @xmath19 .",
    "once the system of coupled non - linear integral equations ( [ htba ] ) is solved ( usually this may only be achieved numerically ) for the @xmath17 unknown functions @xmath30 , one is in a position to determine the scaling function @xmath36 which may be viewed as the off - critical central charge of the virasoro algebra .",
    "we shall now adopt the method of @xcite and instead of regarding the tba - equation as an integral equation , we transform it into an infinite order differential equation .",
    "this is possible with the sole assumption that the fourier transform of the function @xmath37 can be expanded as a power series @xmath38 then it is a simple consequence of the convolution theorem @xmath39 that the integral equation ( [ htba ] ) may also be written as an infinite order differential equation @xmath40 we introduced here the abbreviation @xmath41 .",
    "the two alternative formulations of the tba - equations serve different purposes . its variant in form of an integral equation ( [ htba ] )",
    "is most convenient for numerical studies , whereas the differential equations ( [ tbadiff ] ) turn out to be useful for analytical considerations .    from a numerical point of view",
    "it is advantageous to make a change of variables and instead of the functions @xmath30 use the so - called pseudo - energies @xmath42 defined via the equations @xmath43 for fermionic and bosonic type of statistics the formulation of the tba - equations in terms of pseudo - energies is most common .",
    "however , since ( [ pseudoe ] ) may obviously not be solved in general , it is more convenient to keep the tba - equations in terms of the @xmath30 for general haldane type of statistics .",
    "alternatively we may relate all types of statistics to the fermionic one in the following way . considering a system which interacts statistically via @xmath22",
    ", we can define the quantity @xmath44 and parameterize all @xmath45functions by @xmath46 .",
    "then the tba - equations ( [ htba ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath47 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eps}\\ ] ] it should be kept in mind that @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is now a formal parameter and , except in the fermionic case , it is not related to the ratio of particle densities @xmath50 in the characteristic way as a distribution function associated to the relevant statistics , i.e. @xmath42 obtained as a solution of the equations ( [ pseudoe ] ) .",
    "we shall now analytically investigate the behaviour of the scaling function in the ultraviolet limit , i.e. @xmath5 is going to zero .",
    "for this purpose we generalize the procedure of zamolodchikov @xcite , which leads to approximated analytical expressions .",
    "we attempt to keep the discussion model independent and free of a particular choice of the statistical interaction as long as possible . introducing the quantity @xmath51 and performing the shift @xmath52 the tba - equations ( [ tbadiff ] )",
    "acquire the form @xmath53 here we have neglected the terms proportional to @xmath54 , under the assumption that @xmath55 . obviously the @xmath5-dependence has vanished , such that the @xmath56 are @xmath5-independent .",
    "the equation for the scaling function ( [ c(r ) ] ) becomes , under similar manipulations and the neglect of similar terms as in the derivation of ( [ tbashift ] ) , @xmath57    in analogy to the procedure of @xcite , we consider now the so - called `` truncated scaling function '' @xmath58 which obviously coincides with @xmath4 for @xmath59 @xmath60 . at this point",
    "we make several assumptions :    1 .",
    "the functions @xmath56 obey the equations ( [ tbashift ] ) .",
    "2 .   in the power series expansion ( [ fexp ] ) the coefficients are symmetric in the particle type indices , i.e. @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "3 .   all odd coefficients vanish in ( [ fexp ] ) , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the function @xmath56 and its derivatives read @xmath64    assumption ii ) is guaranteed when the two - particle scattering matrix is parity invariant and the statistical interaction is symmetric in particle type , @xmath65 .",
    "the requirement iii ) puts of course constraints on the scattering matrices for given statistics , or vice versa .",
    "it will turn out in the next section , that for fermionic statistics it is satisfied by all scattering matrices of interest to us .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour iv ) will be verified in retrospective , that is all known numerical solutions exhibit this kind of asymptotic behaviour .    under these assumptions",
    "the truncated scaling function may also be written as @xmath66 here @xmath67 denotes rogers dilogarithm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the equality ( [ solu ] ) is most easily derived when considering the differential equation which results from ( [ truncc ] ) @xmath68 one may now verify by direct substitution is useful in this context . ]",
    "that ( [ diff ] ) is solved by ( [ solu ] ) when i)-iii ) hold .",
    "the constant of integration is fixed by the property @xmath69 , such that ( [ solu ] ) is exact if iv ) holds .",
    "one of the best known outcomes of the tba - analysis is the fact that in the extreme ultraviolet limit the scaling function becomes the effective central charge of the underlying ultraviolet conformal field theory , i.e. @xmath70 . in order to carry out this limit",
    ", we note that the assumptions ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) also imply @xmath71 such that equations ( [ tbadiff ] ) become a set of coupled non - linear equations for the @xmath17 constants @xmath72@xmath73 due to the fact that @xmath30 is positive , we deduce that these equations admit physical solutions when @xmath74 . for",
    "a given s - matrix this condition will restrict possible statistical interactions . with the help of the solutions of ( [ ex1 ] ) we recover from ( [ solu ] ) the well known formula for the extreme ultraviolet limit @xmath75 these equations",
    "have been analyzed extensively in the literature for various models @xcite and as we demonstrated , also hold for general ( haldane ) type of statistics .      in order to keep the next leading order in the ultraviolet limit we proceed as follows : under the assumption that the symmetry property of @xmath76 still holds at this point of the derivation , we may neglect in ( [ tbashift ] ) also the term @xmath77 .",
    "assuming that @xmath56 is large and ( [ a1 ] ) holds , the tba - equation in the ultraviolet limit may be approximated by @xmath78 unfortunately this equation may not be solved analytically in its full generality .",
    "however , choosing now the statistics in such a way that the @xmath79 we may solve ( [ appdiff ] ) . in most cases we shall be considering in the following , this condition implies that we have fermionic type of statistics . for this case",
    "the solution of ( [ appdiff ] ) reads @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the constants of integration and @xmath82 .",
    "note that the assumption @xmath83 is not always guaranteed below .",
    "we will discard the second term in the following w.l.g . under the same assumptions",
    "the expression for the truncated scaling function ( [ solu ] ) becomes @xmath84 substitution of the solution ( [ soll ] ) into ( [ ctrunc ] ) yields @xmath85 notice that this expression for the truncated effective central charge is independent of the constants @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we use the latter property to argue that in fact the r.h.s . of ( [ ctrun1 ] ) corresponds to the scaling function @xmath4 .",
    "invoking now also the property @xmath88 we obtain the additional relations @xmath89 with @xmath90 being an odd integer , which we choose to be one . at the moment",
    "we do not have any further argument at hand in order to fix the remaining constant .",
    "therefore we have @xmath91 using the fact that @xmath92 tends to zero for small @xmath5 , the equations ( [ l1])-([l4 ] ) demonstrate the consistency with the assumption that the derivatives of @xmath30 with respect to @xmath19 are negligible , i.e. equation ( [ slowvary ] ) .",
    "closer inspection shows that for given @xmath5 the series build from the @xmath93 starts to diverge at a certain value of @xmath90 .",
    "since ( [ lappp ] ) is not exact this does not pose any problem , but one should be aware of it .",
    "the scaling function becomes in this approximation @xmath94 as already pointed out there does not seem to be any argument in this approach which allows to fix the constant @xmath86 .",
    "however , we will present below a natural guess and also resort to numerical data to fix it .    in order to perform more concrete computations one has to specify a particular model at this point .",
    "affine toda field theories @xcite constitute a huge , important and well studied class of relativistically invariant integrable models in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the exact two - particle scattering matrices of all affine toda field theories with real coupling constant were constructed on the base of the bootstrap principle @xcite and its generalized version @xcite .",
    "various cases have been checked perturbatively .",
    "the theories exhibit an entirely different behaviour depending on whether they are self - dual or not . here",
    "duality has a double meaning , on one hand it refers to the invariance of the algebra under the interchange of roots and co - roots ( i.e. @xmath95 ) and on the other hand it refers to the strong - weak duality in the coupling constant .",
    "we recall now some well known facts about the two particle scattering matrix and present some new features which will be important for our analysis below . for theories related to simply laced lie algebras",
    "the two particle s - matrices @xcite involving the @xmath5 different types of particles may be furnished into the universal form @xmath96 the building blocks @xmath97 may be expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions , albeit it will be most convenient for our purposes to use their integral representation @xmath98 with @xmath99 we adopt here the notations of @xcite and denote the coxeter number by @xmath100 , fundamental weights by @xmath101 , the colour values related to the bicolouration of the dynkin diagram by @xmath102 and a simple root @xmath92 times @xmath102 by @xmath103 . the coxeter element is chosen to be @xmath104 , where the elements @xmath105 are introduced , with @xmath106 being a weyl reflections and @xmath107 the set of simple roots with colour values @xmath108 , respectively .",
    "the effective coupling constant @xmath109 depends monotonically on the coupling constant @xmath110 and takes values between 0 and 2 .",
    "many of the properties of ( [ s ] ) are very well documented in the literature @xcite and we will therefore only concentrate on those which are relevant for our investigations .",
    "one of the remarkable features is the strong - weak duality in the coupling constant @xmath110 , which is a particular example for one of the dualities which are currently ubiquitous in string theoretical investigations .",
    "whilst in the latter context duality serves as a powerful principle , we will frequently employ it as a simple consistency check on various expressions which arise during our computations .",
    "the strong - weak duality manifests itself by the fact that each individual building block , and consequently the whole s - matrix , possesses the symmetry @xmath111",
    ". a further check , which we wish to pursue from time to time for consistency reasons , is taking the coupling constant to zero , i.e. @xmath112 or equivalently @xmath113 , such that we obtain a free theory with @xmath114 . also we want to compare with some known results for the so - called minimal part of the scattering matrix ( [ s ] ) , which is formally obtained by taking the limit @xmath115    it will be important below to recall that the block @xmath116 only occurs ( with power one ) in the scattering matrix between two particles of the same type , i.e. in @xmath117 , which implies for the s - matrices ( [ s ] ) @xmath118 . a further relation which exhibits the occurrence of particular blocks is @xmath119 here @xmath120 is the incidence matrix of the lie algebraic dynkin diagram , i.e. twice the unit matrix minus the cartan matrix @xmath121 . since relation ( [ 2block ] ) will be important for our analysis and does not seem to appear in the literature , we will briefly prove it here .",
    "we make use of the interrelation between the incidence matrix and particular elements of the weyl group and the action of these elements on simple roots @xcite @xmath122 taking the inner product of the first equation in ( [ hh ] ) with @xmath123 and the subsequent application of the second relation on the r.h.s .",
    "yields @xmath124 therefore , by the orthogonality of fundamental weights and simple roots and the symmetry in @xmath21 and @xmath125 , it follows directly that @xmath126 noting further that @xmath127 , we may extract the block @xmath128 with power @xmath120 from the product in ( [ s ] ) and obtain ( [ 2block ] ) .",
    "remarkably one may also carry out the product in ( [ s ] ) and obtain a closed expression for @xmath129 in the form @xmath130 the lie algebraic quantities involved in this identity , i.e. @xmath131 and @xmath100 , are more easily accessible than the orbits of the coxeter elements , however , this is at the cost that the singularity structure is less transparent .",
    "formula ( [ sc ] ) coincides with equation ( 5.2 ) in @xcite ( up to a factor @xmath132 ) , once the general expression in there is reduced to the simply laced case .",
    "in the course of our argumentation we will also employ the identity @xmath133 which was derived first in @xcite .",
    "once one turns to the consideration of affine toda field theories related to non - simply laced lie algebras many of the universal features which one observes for simply laced lie algebras cease to be valid .",
    "for instance for the simply laced lie algebras it is known that the singularities of ( [ s ] ) inside the physical sheet do not depend on the coupling constant and remarkably all masses renormalise with an overall factor .",
    "these latter behaviours dramatically change once the related lie algebras are taken to be non - simply laced ( except @xmath134 which is also self - dual ) .",
    "in fact in these cases one can not associate anymore a unique lie algebra to the quantum field theory , but a dual pair related to each other by the interchange of roots and co - roots .",
    "general formulae similar to ( [ s ] ) , which are valid for all non - simply lie laced algebras have not been constructed yet .",
    "however , one can still construct s - matrices @xcite @xmath135 _ { \\theta } \\label{nichtsimp}\\ ] ] out of some universal building blocks which generalize ( [ block ] ) @xmath136 _ { \\theta } = \\exp \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{dt}{t\\sinh t}\\,\\,g_{x , y , b}(t)\\sinh \\left ( \\frac{\\theta t}{i\\pi } \\right ) \\,\\ , .",
    "\\label{nonblocks}\\ ] ] in distinction to the simply laced case , the variable @xmath137 may now become non - integer , @xmath138 is @xmath139 or @xmath140 and @xmath141 the coxeter number @xmath100 has been replaced by a `` floating coxeter number '' @xmath142 , in the sense that it equals the coxeter number of one of the two dual algebras in the weak limit and the other in the strong limit .",
    "the singularities of ( [ nichtsimp ] ) now depend on the coupling constant which leads to a modification of the bootstrap as explained in @xcite .",
    "the shift of the masses resulting from the renormalization procedure can not be compensated anymore by an overall factor .",
    "in contrast to the simply laced case , the control over the set in which @xmath137 and @xmath138 take their values is slightly different than in ( [ s ] ) .",
    "whereas in ( [ s ] ) the powers of the blocks may be computed directly from the lie algebraic quantities , in the non - simply laced case they are obtained solving at first some recursive equations and thereafter extracting the powers from a generating function @xcite . there exists however a generalization of ( [ sc ] ) which also includes the non - simply laced case . in this paper",
    "we will not treat the completely generic case and shall be content with treatment of one particular case in order to exhibit the difference towards the simply laced case , such that ( [ nichtsimp ] ) and ( [ nonblocks ] ) are sufficient for our purposes .",
    "given the s - matrices we are now in a position to compute the relevant quantities for our analysis , i.e. the kernels appearing in the tba - equations ( [ htba ] ) and the fourier coefficients in equation ( [ fexp ] ) .",
    "taking the logarithmic derivative of the phase of the scattering matrix ( [ s ] ) the tba - kernels ( without the statistics factor ) are easily computed to @xmath143 where @xmath144 we introduced the function @xmath145 and set @xmath146 . depending on the context either the variant ( [ intrep ] ) or ( [ hyprep ] ) turn out to be more convenient .",
    "the fourier transform is most easily evaluated when we use the integral representation ( [ intrep ] ) for each block @xmath147 where @xmath148/\\sinh ( \\pi k)$ ] .",
    "therefore we have @xmath149 this means , that just like the s - matrix itself , we may express the tba - kernels and their fourier transformed versions in terms of general blocks .",
    "the difference is that now instead of the powers of the blocks their pre - factors are determined by orbits of the coxeter element .",
    "notice also that the property @xmath150 guaranteed that in ( [ s ] ) the products @xmath151 and @xmath152 are equivalent .",
    "since now @xmath153 , we have to take the sum over the appropriate range .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath154 is shifted in ( [ fts ] ) .",
    "remarkably for the fourier transformed kernels it is possible to evaluate the whole sum over @xmath154 in ( [ fts ] ) in an indirect way .",
    "we obtain the universal form @xmath155    a similar matrix identity has turned out to be extremely useful in the investigation @xcite of the tba - kernel for the minimal part of the scattering matrix ( [ s ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ funi ] ) coincides with an identity quoted in @xcite once the roaming parameter therein is chosen in such the way that the resonance scattering matrices take on the form of ( [ s ] ) . taking the inverse fourier transform of ( [ funii ] ) we obtain after an intgeration with respect to @xmath156 the integral representation ( [ sc ] ) for the scattering matrix .    since the identity ( [ funi ] ) is by no means obvious , in particular with regard to ( [ fts ] )",
    ", we will now provide a rigourous proof of it .",
    "essentially we have to use the fourier transformed version of the relation ( [ rel ] ) for this purpose . shifting the fourier integral into the complex plane yields @xmath157 here",
    "the contours @xmath158 are depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "@xmath159 denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "the poles inside the contours are collected by considering ( [ kernel ] ) and ( [ hyprep ] ) . obviously coupling constant dependent poles",
    "may only result from @xmath160 and @xmath161 , whilst poles directly on the contours at @xmath162 may only originate from @xmath163 and @xmath164 . from the statements made in subsection 4.1.1 .",
    ", it follows that the former blocks may only occur when @xmath165 and from equation ( [ 2block ] ) we infer that the pre - factor of @xmath166 is @xmath120 .",
    "the relevant residues are computed easily and by noting further that the singularities directly on the contour count half , we have established ( [ h3 ] ) .",
    "@xmath167    acting now with @xmath168 times the logarithmic derivative on the identity ( [ rel ] ) , multiplying with @xmath169 and integrating thereafter with respect to @xmath19 we obtain @xmath170 on the other hand the l.h.s .",

    "when we take the limit @xmath172 , the coupling constant dependent poles move outside the contours @xmath158 , such that the term involving @xmath173 will be absent in ( [ h33 ] ) and we recover the result of @xcite . the weak limit @xmath174 turns equ .",
    "( [ h33 ] ) into a trivial identity by noting that with ( [ funi ] ) @xmath175 .    as the last quantity which will be important for our considerations we have to compute the power series expansion of @xmath176 . for this purpose",
    "we make use of the identity @xmath177 which follows directly from the generating function for the bernoulli polynomials @xmath178 of degree @xmath90 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we may then expand each building block of the fourier transformed tba - kernel ( [ genexp ] ) as @xmath179 where the coefficients are @xmath180 .",
    "therefore we obtain for the fourier coefficients in equation ( [ fexp ] ) @xmath181 for @xmath182 the second order coefficient is particularly important with regard to our approximated analytical solution presented in section 3.2 and we will therefore analyze it a bit further . from ( [ mu ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath183 , such that @xmath184 we may evaluate the sum over @xmath154 by noting further that @xmath185 the first identity follows by inverting the relation @xmath186 @xcite and the second by computing the geometric series . therefore ( [ eta ] ) becomes @xmath187 the latter formula follows immediately by recalling that @xmath188 .",
    "it has the virtue that it is directly applicable since it involves only quantities which may be effortlessly extracted from lie algebraic tables .",

    "clearly an unsatisfactory feature of our approximated analytical expression for the scaling function ( [ universal ] ) is that , at the moment , we do not have any additional constraint at hand which allows to determine the constant @xmath110 .",
    "admittedly the choice ( [ konstanten ] ) enters our analysis in a rather ad hoc way . at the moment the rational behind our choice is that we may compare it with the semi - classical results in the spirit of @xcite and thereafter restore the strong - weak duality .",
    "in addition it is supported by our numerical results .",
    "surely this is by no means unique and it is highly desirable to eliminate this ambiguity .    nonetheless , different choices of the constant will not change the overall behaviour and our expression is clearly in conflict with the results of cassi and destri @xcite , who found @xmath360 for the function in equation ( [ typical ] ) . the convention",
    "therein are that @xmath281 labels the particle type with smallest mass and @xmath361 results from the power series @xmath362 . on the side of the tba - analysis the origin of this discrepancy",
    "may be tracked down easily .",
    "a behaviour of the type quoted in @xcite was derived before in @xcite for affine toda field theories related to the minimal part of the scattering matrix ( [ s ] ) .",
    "this result was then extrapolated by cassi and destri in the way that @xmath361 was taken to be the coefficient of the power series related to the full coupling constant dependent scattering matrix . however , the derivations in @xcite rely heavily on the assumption that the function @xmath363 is constant in the region @xmath364 .",
    "it is essentially this property which is lost for the full theory ( as our numerical results demonstrate ) , such that the arguments of cassi and destri become faulty",
    ". it would be interesting to settle the question also on the perturbative side and bring our results into agreement with perturbation theory .",
    "our findings will surely have consequences for the subtraction scheme used in such considerations .",
    "there exist of course other methods which allow to extract the ultraviolet central charge from a massive integrable model .",
    "the c - theorem @xcite has turned out to be very efficient in this context and a direct comparison is very suggestive .",
    "as the main input , the c - theorem requires the n - particle form factors ( the 2-particle form factor is usually sufficient ) related to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor . unlike in the situation of conformal invariance , in which the trace vanishes , this tensor is not unique and acquires some scaling behaviour for massive theories . as observed in @xcite ,",
    "the consequence of this fact is that the c - theorem produces a whole ray of central charges greater than the rank of the underlying lie algebra @xmath365 .",
    "the natural question which arises is to identify the origin of this ambiguity inside the tba - approach .",
    "one might assume that it results from several possible solutions of the tba - equation .",
    "however , this possibility is definitely ruled out as follows from our investigations in section 5 .",
    "since the statistical interaction @xmath26 enters the analysis as a further parameter , this could provide a further possible mechanism which produces the observed values . as our investigations demonstrate , however , also this possibility can be excluded for certain , since different choices for @xmath26 only produce central charges smaller than the rank of @xmath365 . in the light of this",
    "results we conjecture that the responsible mechanism is to include a non - vanishing chemical potential in the way as was already indicated by yang and yang @xcite . to settle this question precisely requires more detailed investigations @xcite .",
    "there are several further questions which should be addressed in order to complete the picture .",
    "it will certainly be interesting to obtain also the higher terms beyond the first leading order in ( [ typical ] ) and to exploit further the y - systems of section 4.4 . as an alternative analytical approach .",
