    "polarimetry plays a key role in our understanding of the emission mechanism of pulsars , the ambient conditions in the emission region and the geometrical structure of the magnetic field .",
    "similar to the great variety of profile shapes , the polarimetric features of the radio emission vary strongly from pulsar to pulsar and from frequency to frequency .",
    "virtually every polarization state between totally unpolarized and fully linearly or highly circularly polarized can be found amongst different pulsars and even within one profile .",
    "also the shape of the polarization position angle ( hereafter ppa ) curve varies between nearly constant , a smooth orderly swing , sudden jumps and nearly chaotic behaviour .",
    "the jumps in the ppa  swing often cover precisely @xmath1 and are therefore called orthogonal polarization modes ( hereafter opm , see e.g. stinebring et al .",
    "1984 ; gil & lyne 1995 ; gangadhara 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless certain common pulse features have been identified in the past , which lead to different classification attempts ( e.g. backer 1976 ; rankin 1983 ; lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that two general types of profile components can be identified : those which are radiated from the outer parts of the emission tube as _ conal _ profile components and those which are usually emitted from the central part as _ core_-beams . this classification was initially formulated systematically by rankin ( 1983 ) , for a detailed description we refer to that paper , a short summary is given in sect . [ types ] .",
    "the identification of these components is mainly ( but not only ) based on the frequency development of their polarization and their relative intensity . in general",
    "this system has proven to be remarkably successful , although in this paper we discuss some groups of pulsars which do not quite fit into this classification scheme .",
    "one common polarimetric feature of most pulsars is the depolarization towards high frequencies ( in the following `` high frequency '' means radio frequencies well above one ghz ) .",
    "whereas the degree of polarization of pulsars is usually constantly high at low frequencies , it decreases rapidly above a certain frequency ( e.g. manchester 1971 ; morris et al . 1981a ; xilouris et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this tendency is in contrast to the known properties of other astrophysical objects which have usually stronger polarization at higher frequencies , where the faraday - depolarization effect is less severe .",
    "therefore , this effect is thought to be inherent to the pulsar magnetosphere , either intrinsic to the emission mechanism or due to a propagation effect within the magnetosphere .",
    "the identification of the depolarization mechanism is important as it might help to understand the environmental conditions in the magnetosphere and the relevant physical processes .",
    "it is therefore necessary to carry out high frequency observations as we would like to identify parameters which control this effect .    in this paper",
    "we also focus on the role of the circular polarization .",
    "theories proposed to explain this type of polarization range from purely intrinsic mechanisms ( e.g. @xcite ) to pure propagation effects ( e.g. @xcite ) and combinations of both ( e.g. kazbegi et al .",
    "1991 ; naik & kulkarni 1994 ) . in order to distinguish between the different mechanisms ,",
    "it is necessary to trace the frequency development of the circular polarization over a large frequency interval .",
    "propagational effects should show a strong frequency dependence .    whereas the degree of polarization varies strongly with frequency ,",
    "the measured ppa is very stable over many octaves in frequency .",
    "if one allows for the occurrence of opms , the ppa swing is therefore thought to reflect the geometry of the pulsar magnetosphere as first noted by radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) . in some cases",
    "it is therefore possible to determine the viewing geometry of a pulsar by fitting the geometry dependent theoretical ppa curve  the rotating vector model ( hereafter rvm )  to the measured ppa ( the formula for the rvm is given e.g. by manchester & taylor ( 1977 ) ) .",
    "many authors indicate the existence of a radius - to - frequency mapping ( hereafter rfm ) where the radio emission is narrow band and scales inversely with frequency ( e.g. cordes 1978 ; blaskiewicz et al . 1991 ; kramer et al .",
    "1997 ; kijak & gil 1997 ; von hoensbroech & xilouris 1997a ) .",
    "the knowledge of the existence and the strength of the rfm is important as it will help to understand the emission physics .",
    "it is therefore necessary to determine the emission height above the pulsar surface , where the emission we observe at a certain frequency , originates .",
    "polarimetry provides one method amongst others to calculate this height .",
    "this method was proposed by blaskiewicz et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and we have applied it to our data whenever possible ( see sect . [ rem ] ) .",
    "due to their steep radio spectra , pulsars tend to be rather weak sources at centimetre wavelengths . as a result ,",
    "relatively little published data exists in this part of the spectrum ( morris at al .",

    "[ 0144 ] and [ circ ] .",
    "radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) were the first to argue that the magnetic field in the emission region has a dipolar structure and that the ppa corresponds to the projection of the magnetic field line direction on the sky .",
    "more recently , blaskiewicz et al . (",
    "1991 ) demonstrated that the ppa curves behave as predicted in the case of a _ vacuo _ purely dipolar aligned rotator ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relativistic model for the rvm ( see @xcite ) gives a formula for the calculation of absolute emission heights as @xmath133 where @xmath2 is the time lag between the centroid of the total intensity profile and the pulse phase at which the derivative of the ppa curve has its maximum .",
    "we calculated the emission altitudes for nine profiles ( eight pulsars , one with interpulse ) at 4.9 ghz using our polarization data ( see table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "together with the emission heights for 17 pulsars from ( von hoensbroech & xilouris 1997a ) at the same frequency and derived using the same method , we compared the results with predictions from the relationship proposed by kijak & gil ( 1997 ) @xmath134 @xmath135 m is the neutron star radius , @xmath136 is the frequency in ghz , @xmath137 is the timing age in units of million years and @xmath138 is pulsar period in seconds . in most cases",
    "the results are consistent within the errors ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . this result supports the view that the pulsar high frequency radio emission originates from a region very close to the pulsar surface at a few percent of the light cylinder radius .",
    "we have analyzed our data together with high frequency data which was already published by von hoensbroech & xilouris ( 1997b ) and compared the polarimetric properties to those at lower frequencies .",
    "the low frequency data is from gould & lyne ( 1998 ) and was accessed through the european pulsar network ( epn ) internet database .",
    "the great variety of pulsars in pulse - shapes and polarization characteristics has always puzzled many researchers .",
    "some authors proposed empirical classification concepts ( e.g. rankin 1983 ; lyne & manchester 1988 ) .",
    "these classification schemes are based on the different properties of _ core _ and _ conal _ components : the core components are usually located close to the profile centre and tend to show a moderate degree of circular polarization and an unsystematic ppa swing .",
    "cone components show hardly any circular and a moderate degree linear polarization .",
    "the ppa swing is more systematic and can usually be modelled with the rvm .",
    "the spectral index ( @xmath139 in @xmath140 ) for the core components is higher than for the cone components ( see also kramer et al .",
    "therefore , at high frequencies cone components become increasingly visible , if not dominant .",
    "finally , core components tend to be more stable and features like mode changing  temporal changes of the average profile  and drifting subpulses  stable subpulse features , which drift systematically with respect to the pulse phase through successive individual pulses , see e.g. manchester et al .",
    "( 1975 )  are rarely seen for these components .",
    "the shape of a pulse profile then mainly depends on the _ impact angle _ and on the pulsar - specific _ source function _ , which represents the ( patchy ? ) filling function of the emitting tube ( e.g. lyne & manchester 1988 ; manchester 1994 ) .",
    "if the impact angle is small enough , the line of sight possibly cuts through the central beam and the corresponding core component becomes visible .",
    "our pulsar sample at 4.9 ghz generally fits well in these concepts .",
    "nevertheless , we find a few groups of objects whose properties differ from what is expected from these classification systems . as these are not just individual objects , but form groups with similar characteristics , it is suggested that additional ( or different ) effects can play a role for the creation of intensity and polarization profiles of radio pulsars .",
    "as some authors already pointed out , there is an evolutionary aspect to keep in mind .",
    "so young pulsars tend to be highly polarized ( e.g. @xcite ) and the cone ",
    "dominated ones are usually old ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this group of pulsars , which is represented by the pulsar b0355 + 54 , consists of objects which share the following features : one component is highly linearly polarized ( @xmath141 ) whereas the rest of the profile shows only little or moderate polarization .",
    "the highly polarized component has a flatter spectral behaviour than the profile as a total , thus dominating it at high frequencies .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ 0355_freq ] ) .",
    "examples for such pulsars are psrs b0355 + 54 , b0450 + 55 , b0599@xmath305 , b0626 + 24 , b1822@xmath309 , b1842 + 14 , b1935 + 25 and b2224 + 65 .",
    "the existence of pulsars with a highly polarized leading component has already been noted in several papers ( e.g. manchester et al .",
    "1980 ; morris et al .",
    "1981a ) , but within this group we find also 2 pulsars where the polarized component is trailing .",
    "interestingly , these pulsars seem to have preferably two main components .",
    "they have usually been classified as _ half cones _",
    "( e.g. lyne & manchester 1988 ; rankin et al .",
    "1989 ) , meaning that only one half of the polarized cone can be seen . this view has been supported by the fact that the ppa follows a shallow change during the polarized part of the profile ( corresponding to an outer part of the emission cone ) and a steeper change during the unpolarized component ( corresponding to an inner part ) .",
    "the surprising fact is that , if they were really half cones , one would expect to find even a larger number of pulsars with two highly polarized components , enclosing one unpolarized part .",
    "we are not aware of any such example , thus this observation puts doubt on the interpretation of these pulsars as half cones .",
    "these are the `` textbook''-pulsars .",
    "classified as conal doubles ( @xcite ) they represent the traditional hollow cone model .",
    "the two components are moderately linearly polarized and the ppa follows nearly perfectly the rvm . between the two components they usually show a core - type bridge ( see fig .",
    "[ 0525plot ] ) .",
    "examples for such pulsars are the psrs b0148@xmath306 , b0301 + 19 , b0525 + 21 , b0751 + 32 , b0917 + 63 , b1039@xmath319 and b1938@xmath304 .",
    "but there are some remarkable facts to mention about these pulsars .",
    "they often show a certain degree of circular polarization , which is usually associated with the conal components and not with the bridge ( as one would expect from the classification ) .",
    "they depolarize strongly towards high frequencies . as they are usually weak objects with a steep spectral index , it is relatively difficult to obtain high frequency polarization profiles .",
    "interestingly these pulsars are all relatively old objects which are located close to the `` death - line '' in the @xmath142 diagram .",
    "the periods are long and the loss of rotational energy @xmath0 is low",
    ". only few objects of this kind are known .",
    "this suggests that the relative geometry of pulsar and observer is only partly responsible for the profile morphology .",
    "it seems that a major role ",
    "both for the profile morphology and the polarization characteristics  is played by the age @xmath143 and therefore by intrinsic pulsar parameters , such as @xmath0 , which again determine the ambient plasma conditions ( see also sect . [ corrl ] ) .",
    "the ability to emit polarized high frequency radiation in general , and core emission in particular , is obviously reduced for such pulsars .",
    "as these objects are usually also the oldest stars , their profile morphology rather appears to be a ( final ) evolutionary stage than the product of a random geometry ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another remarkable group of pulsars shares the following features : they are young objects with a very high @xmath0 , a flat radio spectrum behaviour , x - ray emission and radio - emission over a wide fraction of the pulse period .",
    "they are nearly fully polarized , linearly and circularly , and do not show any observable depolarization effects towards high frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ 1800type ] ) .",
    "examples are the pulsars b1800@xmath321 , b1823@xmath313 and b1259@xmath363 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the behaviour of these pulsars is difficult to explain within the classification scheme , although parallels to conal double pulsars have been drawn for b1800@xmath321 by wu et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and for b1259@xmath363 by manchester & johnston ( 1995 ) .",
    "but there are major differences .",
    "the 1800@xmath321-type pulsars are much stronger polarized and show so far no depolarization towards high frequencies , as it seems to occur strongly for the classical conal pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high degree of polarization suggests that competing opms are not active in most parts of the profile .",
    "so either only one polarization mode is produced , or only one mode can propagate .",
    "other differences are the general properties of these objects ( see above ) . in every respect",
    "they are opposite to the classical conal pulsars .",
    "the fact that the polarization characteristics of this group are very unusual and the pulsars share the above mentioned other unusual properties , raises the question that there might be an intrinsic relation between a high @xmath0 , a shallow spectrum and a high polarization at high frequencies .",
    "we investigate this question in more depth in the following section .      during our high frequency analysis we found five pulsars which show an unusual polarization behaviour .",
    "their degree of circular polarization _ increases _ strongly with frequency ( see fig . [ 0144_freq ] ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the `` textbook''-sentence : `` pulsars depolarize towards high frequencies '' .",
    "as we regard this effect as critical for the emission physics , we will consider it separately in sect .",
    "[ circ ] . here",
    "we will just discuss these stars in the light of the classification system .",
    "looking through published data and our own data , we found five examples for this behaviour and a couple of suspects ( the lack of high frequency data makes it difficult to confirm the suspects as members of this group ) .",
    "the clear examples are psrs b0144 + 59 , b0320 + 39 , b1737@xmath330 , b1913 + 10 and b1914 + 13 . due to their strong circular polarization",
    "these pulsars would be usually classified as core - pulsars , but especially the frequency development of the b0144 + 59-profile puts doubt on this interpretation . at low frequencies ,",
    "three components can clearly be identified . in opposite behaviour to the prediction of the classification model , the moderately linearly polarized outer components ( outriders ) weaken towards higher frequencies and the strongly circularly polarized central component dominates the profile .",
    "in fact , if the frequency development would be reversed , it would be a perfect example for a core - single ( @xmath144 ) pulsar .",
    "an important question within emission physics is , whether the polarization properties correlate with any other pulsar parameters .",
    "some researchers have already noticed that the degree of polarization weakly correlates with @xmath145 and anti - correlates with the period @xmath138 ( morris et al .",
    "1981a ; gould 1994 ) .",
    "but this was done at frequencies @xmath146 3 ghz and not very significant .",
    "the high frequency range on the other hand is of special interest for this question since the depolarization occurs in this regime .",
    "a possible correlation could tell us something about the relevant parameters for the depolarization process ( which might actually be essentially the same as the polarizing mechanism ) . to our knowledge",
    "two attempts have already been made to correlate the _ depolarization index _ ( which is the power - law - index of @xmath147 ) to other pulsar parameters .",
    "using 2.7 ghz data , morris et al .",
    "( 1981a ) presented indications , that long period pulsars depolarize faster than short period ones .",
    "xilouris et al .",
    "( 1995 ) presented an anti - correlation between the depolarization index and the surface accelerating potential @xmath148 ( @xmath149 being the surfave magnetic field strength ) for 29 pulsars , using 10.6 ghz data . also during the analysis of our data",
    ", it became clear , that highly polarized emission at 4.9 ghz can only be found with short period pulsars .",
    "this corresponds to the relationship found by morris et al .",
    "( 1981a ) at 2.7 ghz .",
    "the degree of polarization therefore seems to correlate more or less significantly with various pulsar parameters .",
    "we want to know , with which property the best correlation can be found , applying the following procedure : the two parameters which we can measure with the greatest accuracy are the period @xmath138 and the period derivative @xmath145 . from these parameters",
    "we can derive other pulsar properties , such as _ characteristic age @xmath143 , surface magnetic field @xmath150 , rotational energy loss @xmath0 and the polar gap accelerating potential @xmath151_. the functional dependency of all these parameters is @xmath152 , with different exponents @xmath153 and @xmath154 . in order to find a possible correlation with one of the pulsar properties , we correlated the degree of polarization with the above function and varied @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the quality of the correlation was then tested using the pearson - test and the spearman - rank test ( e.g. @xcite ) independently .",
    "interestingly we found the best correlation not only for one , but for a number of combinations of @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the significance of the correlation is @xmath155 , corresponding to a 99.8% probability that the observed correlation is true .",
    "all combinations of @xmath153 and @xmath154 where this best correlation was found , fulfil the condition : @xmath156 .",
    "there are two pulsar properties , which match this condition : the rotational energy loss @xmath157 and the polar gap accelerating potential @xmath158 ( see fig . [ pedot ] , upper plot ) .",
    "it is therefore suggested , that these two ( intrinsically closely related ) parameters strongly influence the polarization properties of the pulsar radio emission .",
    "a similar correlation could not be detected for nearly the same set of pulsars observed at low frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ pedot ] , lower plot ) .",
    "the integrated degree of polarization seems to be randomly distributed with respect to @xmath0 . comparing to high frequencies ,",
    "it becomes obvious that mainly highly polarized low-@xmath0 pulsars show significant depolarization , whereas weakly polarized high-@xmath0 pulsars show an increasing degree of polarization to high frequencies .",
    "this indicates that pulsars with an increasing degree of polarization are not just `` outriders '' , but rather form a systematic group within the pulsar population .    in the following we want to speculate in a straightforward fashion about some possible physical implications of this correlation . under the assumption that the polarization is not strongly influenced by any outer gap plasma effects",
    ", it shows one important fact : when the plasma radiates the radio emission , it somehow `` knows '' about the accelerating potential inside the polar gap respectively about the loss of rotational energy @xmath0 . until the emission of the observed radiation no processes are allowed , which would result in the loss of this information .    as a possible influence of @xmath0 on the radiating plasma , we regard the following : a high @xmath0 implies a high @xmath151 .",
    "this again leads to a higher total kinetic energy of the out - flowing plasma .",
    "this energy is given by @xmath159 @xmath160 is the energy distribution function of the radiating plasma . in order to increase the total energy ,",
    "either the number of plasma - particles @xmath161 or @xmath162 has to increase . to obtain a larger @xmath162",
    ", the distribution function @xmath160 has to be changed either by shifting it to higher energies or by `` flattening '' the function , thus getting a higher particle population at high @xmath163 s .",
    "it is unlikely that the whole function can be shifted to much higher energies , as pair - creation and emission of x- and @xmath163-rays will always limit the @xmath163-factor below certain values . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that the x - ray luminosity correlates strikingly well with @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , which supports the above statement .",
    "we could therefore conclude that either a higher plasma density or a flatter distribution function @xmath160 implies a higher degree of polarization .",
    "there can be two reasons for this :    * if the polarization is an intrinsic property of the emission mechanism it could be concluded that the coherence increases with the plasma density and therefore less independently radiating bunches are superposed and depolarize the radiation .",
    "it is also possible that the polarization of the emission mechanism depends on @xmath160 . in this case",
    "the degree of polarization would depend on the shape of @xmath160 insofar as a flatter distribution function results into a higher degree of polarization . *",
    "the polarization may be caused or at least strongly influenced by a propagation effect .",
    "the influence would be a different frequency dependent refractive index for the two natural ( and orthogonal ) propagation modes .",
    "the frequency walk of these refractive indices would then depend strongly on the plasma density or @xmath160 .",
    "it might be interesting in this context to point to the fact that there is a slight correlation between the spectral index and @xmath0 , such that pulsars with a high @xmath0 often have a flatter spectrum .",
    "for example lorimer et al .",
    "( 1995 ) presented an anti - correlation between the spectral index and the characteristic age , which again is anti - correlated with @xmath0 .",
    "especially those pulsars which have a high @xmath0 _ and _ a high polarization ( 1800@xmath321-type , sect .",
    "[ 1800 ] ) have a very flat spectrum .",
    "this corresponds to the behaviour of the highly polarized profile components of the 0355 + 54-type pulsars ( see sect .",
    "[ 0355 ] ) , which also have a significantly flatter spectrum than the rest of the profile ( see fig .",
    "[ 0355_freq ] ) .",
    "the spectral behaviour of non - thermal radiation mechanisms mainly depends on the energy distribution function of the emitting particles . if this function is flat , thus more particles have higher energies , then the resulting spectrum is flat as well .",
    "therefore it seems that especially the _ shape _ of the energy ",
    "distribution function @xmath160 is influenced by @xmath0 .",
    "concluding one should note that these observations suggest an intrinsic relationship between a high @xmath0 , a high degree of polarization , and a flat spectrum .",
    "this is independent of any core or conal classification of these stars respectively their profile components .",
    "it rather looks as if pulsars with a moderate or high @xmath0 ( and therefore also high @xmath151 ) can develop certain regions on their polar caps , where they direct most of their available energy into the plasma by flattening the distribution function @xmath160 .",
    "this plasma then emits a highly polarized radiation with a comparably flatter spectrum than the rest of the radiating plasma .",
    "one could even speculate that , if such a region develops , it reduces the plasma energy above other parts of the neutron star , leading to an anti - correlation in the occurrence of certain components in single pulse observations , as it is observed e.g. for psr b1822@xmath309 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one fundamental piece in the theory of pulsar radiation  where no consensus has been found yet  is the question whether the polarization arises from the emission process itself or whether it is produced by a birefringinal propagation effect ( e.g. melrose & stoneham 1977 ; cheng & ruderman 1979 ; barnard & arons 1986 ; mckinnon 1997 ) .",
    "the latter case would allow a larger number of considerable emission mechanisms as also processes which are intrinsically _ unpolarized _ could be considered .",
    "qualitatively this would correspond to a separation of the original radiation into two orthogonal natural modes which both experience different frequency dependent indices of refraction .",
    "a spatial or temporal separation of these two modes could then result into opms , a differential absorption into the domination of one mode above the other .",
    "the properties of the two modes would be frequency dependent .",
    "if the plane of polarization develops an angle to the magnetic field lines during the propagation , the ratio of the two great axis of the polarization ellipse could undergo changes which would result into a transition of linear polarization into circular .",
    "some authors have therefore already suggested , that if propagation effects play a role in the pulsar magnetosphere , they should result into an increasing degree of circular polarization with frequency ( melrose & stoneham 1977 ; cheng & ruderman 1979 ) .",
    "the non - existence of corresponding observations was attributed to a possible competing depolarization mechanism .",
    "however authors as manchester et al .",
    "( 1980 ) noted already that some pulsars like vela show a slightly increasing circular contribution .",
    "the frequency - development of the polarization profile of psr b0144 + 59 is to our knowledge the first significant observation of this effect ( see fig .",
    "[ 0144_freq ] and sect .",
    "[ 0144 ] ) .",
    "the degree of circular polarization increases constantly with frequency to a very high value ( @xmath164 ) , whereas the total degree of polarization ( @xmath165 ) is approximately constant above @xmath166 ghz .",
    "it seems unlikely that an intrinsic mechanism other than a propagation effect could result in such a frequency dependence .",
    "we therefore suggest that the magnetosphere can have a birefringing quality , which transforms linear polarization into circular , similar to a @xmath167-plate .",
    "another puzzling aspect about the frequency development of this pulsar is the change of the ppa .",
    "one of the basics in the knowledge of pulsar polarization is the stability of the polarization curve  which eventually lead to the conclusion that the shape of this curve is determined by the geometry of the pulsar .",
    "the only known qualitative changes are connected to the ( frequency dependent ) occurrence of opms .",
    "but in fig .",
    "[ 0144_freq ] we observe a smooth steepening of the ppa curve . the same effect is also observed for psr b1737@xmath330 another pulsar of this class .",
    "the classical interpretation for this change would be that the line of sight changes with frequency .",
    "an alternative interpretation could be that the same propagation effect which transforms linear into circular polarization , leads to a differential rotation of the plane of polarization .",
    "unfortunately only little data about such pulsars is available , so no general statement can be drawn yet . but",
    "additional observations will be carried out soon .",
    "we have analysed average radio pulsar polarization profiles at high frequencies and present 32 previously unpublished pulsar polarization profiles measured at a frequency of 4.9 ghz .",
    "the profiles are also available in epn - format ( @xcite ) through the epn internet database ( see sect . [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the properties of the whole available set of 4.9 ghz average polarization profiles in general and those of individual pulsars in special were compared to lower frequencies .    investigating the average polarization profiles of individual pulsars with particular respect to their classification in the scheme of rankin ( 1983 ) , we found groups of pulsars which deserve additional attention .",
    "* some pulsars , such as psr b0355 + 54 , have components with very different polarimetric and spectral properties within the same profile .",
    "one component is nearly fully polarized and has a flatter spectrum than the profile as a whole , thus dominates the profile at high frequencies .",
    "the rest of the profile is hardly polarized and dominates only at low frequencies .",
    "as all eight pulsars which form this group so far , show a similar frequency - dependence , it is suggested that an intrinsic correlation exists between a high degree of polarization and a flat spectrum .",
    "all these pulsars have been classified as half - cones .",
    "although this classification is tempting , it is important to note that not a single full - cone with similar properties could be found .",
    "this indicates that a more general process takes place than just an occasional lack of flux at the position where the line of sight cuts the cone for the second time .",
    "* there are three young pulsars ( b1800 - 21 , b1823 - 13 and b1259 - 63 ) with a very high loss of rotational energy @xmath0 and a very flat spectrum .",
    "these pulsars are nearly fully polarized and do not show any significant depolarization .",
    "this behaviour shows similarities to the above mentioned highly polarized components of the 0355-like pulsars .",
    "both groups show a correlation between high polarization and a flat spectrum .",
    "* we found a number of objects which show a circular polarization , which strongly _ increases _ with frequency .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the known frequency - dependence of pulsar polarization .",
    "as the linear polarization decreases simultaneously , it is suggested that a propagation - effect similar to a @xmath168-plate is active .",
    "if confirmed , this could indicate , that propagation effects influence the polarization within the magnetosphere .",
    "additionally , these pulsars fit hardly into the classification scheme .",
    "psr b0144 + 59 for instance shows precisely the opposite frequency - development to a @xmath144-pulsar ( see fig .",
    "[ 0144_freq ] ) .",
    "we would like to point out again the possible role of pulsar evolution on the polarization profile . within the empirical model for pulsar emission , the profile shape and the polarization properties",
    "is nearly exclusively determined by the viewing geometry of pulsar and line of sight and the activity in the different parts of the magnetosphere .",
    "but , as it was already noted by rankin ( 1983 ) , the classical conal double pulsars ( the `` textbook - pulsars '' , 0525 + 21-type ) are without exception very old stars which lie close to the `` death - line '' in the @xmath169-diagram .",
    "contrarily the 1800@xmath321-like pulsars mentioned above are very young pulsars with very different properties . for future work it appears to be important to focus stronger on the role of evolution for polarization profile shapes .",
    "analysing the general properties of pulsar polarization profiles at this frequency of 4.9 ghz , we found a significant correlation between the total degree of polarization with @xmath0 and the @xmath151 at the polar gap respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ pedot ] , upper plot ) .",
    "such a correlation does not exist at lower frequencies .",
    "the pulsars at low frequencies rather form groups which have a decreasing ( highly polarized , low @xmath0 pulsars ) and an increasing ( weakly polarized , high @xmath0 pulsars ) degree of polarization to high frequencies .",
    "observations at high radio frequencies therefore yield additional information on the emission physics which is not seen at lower frequencies .",
    "this correlation confirms the relation between the depolarization index and @xmath151 at 10.5 ghz , which was presented by xilouris et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "the large differences in the degree of polarization between individual pulsars indicate that the ambient physical conditions in the respective emitting region differ significantly among them .",
    "as we can see from the correlation , this depends on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 again is closely correlated to the polar gap @xmath151 . as a high degree of polarization seems to be correlated to a flatter spectrum ( see above ) , we speculate that a high @xmath151 could induce a flatter energy distribution function of the radiating plasma .",
