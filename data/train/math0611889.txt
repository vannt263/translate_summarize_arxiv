    "for a general introduction to the theory of stable commutator length , see @xcite .    informally , if @xmath17 for some topological space @xmath18 , commutator length is the smallest genus of a surface in @xmath18 whose boundary represents a given loop in @xmath18 , and stable commutator length `` rationally '' measures the same quantity . at the homological level ,",
    "stable commutator length is an @xmath19 filling norm with @xmath20 coefficients , in the sense of gersten @xcite or gromov @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with obtaining uniform positive lower bounds on stable commutator length in ( word- ) hyperbolic groups and groups acting on ( @xmath1- ) hyperbolic spaces . morally , ( @xmath1- ) hyperbolic spaces are those whose geometry can be efficiently probed by maps of triangles and other surfaces into the space , so it should not be surprising that they can be studied effectively with stable commutator length . however , there is a sense in which our results _ are _ counterintuitive , which we briefly explain .",
    "it is a widely observed fact that in the presence of ( coarse ) negative curvature , one can obtain upper bounds on the `` size '' of a surface which is efficient in some sense . here",
    "size is measured with respect to some kind of norm ; for instance area , whitney @xmath21-norm , @xmath19 norm on homology etc .",
    "efficiency might vary from context to context ( e.g. harmonic , minimal , normal ) and will depend on the way in which we measure the size of the surface .",
    "our main results say that in the presence of ( coarse ) negative curvature , there is a uniform ( positive ) _ lower _ bound on the ( homological ) size of certain surfaces .",
    "we concentrate on _ worst - case _ behavior , rather than _ typical behavior _ , and our results are frequently sharp .",
    "other authors have studied commutator length and its relation with negative curvature , especially gromov @xcite ,  6.@xmath22 . in our language",
    ", gromov observes that in a word - hyperbolic group , if @xmath8 $ ] is not torsion and does not have a power conjugate to its inverse , then @xmath23 ( actually , gromov neglects to mention the second possibility ) .",
    "the key innovation in our paper is that our bounds are _ uniform _ , and depend only on macroscopic features of the group , specifically @xmath1 and number of generators .",
    "note that any hyperbolic group may be made @xmath1-hyperbolic for some universally small @xmath1 ( say @xmath24 ) just by increasing the number of generators , so our results in this sense are best possible .",
    "perhaps our most striking theorem is theorem b , a kind of `` spectral gap '' theorem , which says that in a non - elementary torsion - free word - hyperbolic group , the first accumulation point for stable commutator length as a function from conjugacy classes to positive real numbers is between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "these bounds imply that there is a _",
    "universal _ sense of what it means for an element in a word - hyperbolic group to have a small stable commutator length .",
    "this should perhaps be compared with margulis lemma , which says that there is a universal sense of what it means for a closed geodesic in a hyperbolic manifold to be _",
    "short_. the difficulty in transporting margulis lemma to geometric group theory is that geometric notions in a group are typically only defined up to a certain ambiguity ( e.g. quasi - isometry ) which obscures small scale geometric phenomena .",
    "the advantage of working with stable commutator length , and the power of our theorem , is precisely that it captures such small scale phenomena .",
    "this comparison is more than superficial  the key to obtaining the sharp lower bound is to use estimates due to mineyev which reproduce , in a general @xmath1-hyperbolic space , geometric phenomena which are strictly analogous to @xmath27 phenomena in lie groups .",
    "we are able to give similar uniform lower bounds on the stable commutator length of certain elements in two other important classes of groups : mapping class groups of surfaces ( hereafter denoted @xmath28 ) , and amalgamated free products . in general , neither kind of group is @xmath1-hyperbolic , but each acts naturally on a certain @xmath1-hyperbolic space : the complex of curves , and the bass - serre tree respectively . obtaining lower bounds on stable commutator length in mapping class groups",
    "is intimately tied to important problems in @xmath29-dimensional symplectic geometry ; for example , estimating the complexity of a symplectic @xmath29-manifold filling a given contact @xmath30-manifold , or controlling the ratios of characteristic numbers ( e.g. euler characteristic and signature ) .",
    "this point of view has been pioneered by d. kotschick , sometimes in collaboration with h. endo , in a series of papers which include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . from another point of view",
    ", there are relations between symplectic geometry and stable commutator length which are more intimately connected with invariants like hofer length and subgroup distortion ; see work of polterovich , especially @xcite .",

    "homogeneous quasimorphisms_. a function @xmath31 is a homogeneous quasimorphism if it is homogeneous ( i.e. if it satisfies @xmath32 for all @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) and if there is a least real number @xmath35 called the _ defect _ , for which @xmath36 for all @xmath37 .",
    "the duality theorem says that obtaining lower bounds for stable commutator length is equivalent to constructing homogeneous quasimorphisms with small defects ( see   [ background_section ] ) .",
    "bavard s theorem is non - constructive , and uses the axiom of choice ( in the form of the hahn - banach theorem ) ; however in our paper we are able to construct explicit quasimorphisms with small defects directly .",
    "we are also able to prove various _ separation theorems _ , constructing quasimorphisms with small defects that take big values on prescribed elements and vanish on others .",
    "this is a quantitative improvement on the kinds of separation theorems proved or conjectured by various people in the past , and we expect it to have a number of applications .",
    "let us stress that this paper is concerned more with developing foundations , and understanding what ( to us ) seems like a fundamental algebraic / geometric inequality , manifested in several important group theoretic contexts , than with deducing topological or other corollaries .",
    "we now give a brief summary of the contents of the paper . in ",
    "2 we give definitions , standardize notation , and recall some basic elements of the theory of @xmath1-hyperbolic groups and spaces , and bounded cohomology .",
    "we spend some time discussing mineyev s geodesic flow space , which is a technical tool that we find useful for establishing uniform bounds on stable commutator length directly by means of geometry rather than using quasimorphisms ( see  [ background_section ] for definitions ) .",
    "there are other versions of the geodesic flow space of a word - hyperbolic group or space , and that of gromov @xcite is probably best known",
    ". however , mineyev s space has some features that make it technically easier to use for our purposes .    in ",
    "3 we give the first version of our first main result , the gap theorem :    let @xmath0 be a word - hyperbolic group that is @xmath1-hyperbolic with respect to a symmetric generating set @xmath2 with @xmath4 generators .",

    "note that if @xmath42 then @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to produce examples of word - hyperbolic groups which contain elements with arbitrarily small ( positive ) stable commutator length , so the dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath4 is necessary .",
    "in  4 and  5 we introduce so - called _ counting quasimorphisms _ , and use them to prove the second ( stronger ) version of the gap theorem . in the following theorem , we use the notation @xmath44 to denote the _ translation length _ of an element @xmath39 , as measured in the cayley graph @xmath45 of @xmath0 with respect to a fixed generating set @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that if @xmath46 is not torsion , there is a positive lower bound on @xmath44 that depends only on @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",

    "the defect of @xmath49 is @xmath58    the weak version of the gap theorem follows from the strong version .",
    "moreover , the first part of the strong version follows from the weak version together with an application of bavard s theorem , but the implication in this direction uses the axiom of choice . note that the constants @xmath3 appearing in the two versions are different in either case , but related .",
    "the second part of this strong version of the gap theorem can be thought of as a kind of _ separation theorem _ , which can be summarized in words as follows : given an element @xmath46 and a finite set of elements @xmath52 whose nontrivial powers are never equal to a conjugate of a nontrivial power of @xmath46 , one can ( explicitly ) construct a homogeneous quasimorphism that vanishes on all the @xmath59 and is positive on @xmath46 ; moreover",
    ", the defect of this quasimorphism can be _ uniformly _ controlled just in terms of the _ translation lengths _ of the @xmath59 , and in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "such separation theorems have been pursued by several authors .",
    "for example , polterovich and rudnick @xcite proved such a separation theorem for the group @xmath60 , and asked if one can generalize it to hyperbolic groups ; our work gives a quantitative positive answer to their question .    in  6 we state and prove the accumulation theorem",

    "as mentioned above , we think of this theorem as a kind of `` homological margulis lemma '' .",
    "one can obtain similar theorems for groups with torsion , but the statement is not so clean or universal .    in  7 and  8 we discuss two important examples of groups acting on @xmath1-hyperbolic spaces : the action of the mapping class group on the complex of curves , and the action of an amalgamated free product on its associated tree .",

    "along completely different lines , endo and kotschick @xcite managed to obtain lower bounds on stable commutator length for elements @xmath78 which are products of _ positive dehn twists in disjoint curves_. such elements are reducible , and therefore fix a simplex in the complex of curves @xmath79 ; by contrast , our methods do not give any information about elements with fixed points .",

    "<S> in this paper we obtain uniform positive lower bounds on the stable commutator length of elements in word - hyperbolic groups and certain groups acting on hyperbolic spaces ( namely the mapping class group acting on the complex of curves , and an amalgamated free product acting on an associated bass - serre tree ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is a word - hyperbolic group that is @xmath1-hyperbolic with respect to a symmetric generating set @xmath2 , then there is a positive constant @xmath3 depending only on @xmath1 and on @xmath4 such that every element of @xmath0 either has a power which is conjugate to its inverse , or else the stable commutator length of the element is at least equal to @xmath3 . by bavard </S>",
    "<S> s theorem , these lower bounds on stable commutator length imply the existence of quasimorphisms with uniform control on the defects ; however , we show how to construct such quasimorphisms directly .    </S>",
    "<S> we also prove various separation theorems on families of elements in such groups , constructing homogeneous quasimorphisms ( again with uniform estimates ) which are positive on some prescribed element while vanishing on some family of independent elements whose translation lengths are uniformly bounded .    finally , we prove that the first accumulation point for stable commutator length in a torsion - free word - hyperbolic group is contained between @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a universal sense of what it means for a conjugacy class in a hyperbolic group to have a small stable commutator length , and can be thought of as a kind of `` homological margulis lemma '' .    </S>",
