    "mira is the archetype of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , which contribute significantly to the enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) by a dust - rich molecular stellar wind ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , tracing mass - loss histories of these stars has a profound impact on knowledge of the composition of the ism and its evolution in host galaxies .",
    "mira is actually a wind - accreting binary system @xcite : a mass - losing agb star is the primary star ( mira a ) , dominating the system .",
    "mira s wind is , therefore , a cool molecular wind from the primary , in which dust grains convert radiation pressure of the star into the outward momentum of the wind @xcite .",
    "previous investigations in co line emission revealed that mira s wind at @xmath1 km s@xmath2 formed a circumbinary molecular envelope of @xmath3 in radius , whose otherwise spherical structure was punctuated by bipolar outflows at @xmath4 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "mira s space velocity is approximately @xmath5 km s@xmath2 nearly due south as calculated via a spherical trigonometric transformation @xcite using its proper motion @xcite , radial velocity @xcite and the solar motion @xcite .",
    "hence , mira s wind has been interacting with the ism flow local to mira for quite some time .",
    "this interaction left a turbulent wake of approximately 2 degrees long , observed in emission in the ultraviolet @xcite and 21 cm line @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet emission is thought to be due to h@xmath6 excited collisionally by hot electrons arising from the shocked ism flow .",
    "the 21 cm line emission of atomic hydrogen is , therefore , expected from dissociation of h@xmath6 into h.    this is the second case of the wind - ism interaction around an agb star after r hya , in which a bow shock resulting from the interaction was seen in the far - infrared @xcite .",
    "while the h@xmath6/ wake of mira has been attributed to the wind - ism interaction owing to mira s large space velocity , distinct shock layers of the interaction themselves have not been confirmed observationally , except for the possible bow shock structure seen in the ultraviolet @xcite .",
    "thus , it has been unclear how the h@xmath6/ turbulent wake seen at the large spatial scale is physically related to the co wind seen at the small spatial scale , except that bright h@xmath6 streams @xcite are correlated spatially with co bipolar outflows @xcite .    in this letter , we present mira s far - infrared image taken with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ spitzer _ ; @xcite ) , which resolves spatially the structure of mira s astropause ( a stellar analog of the heliopause ; @xcite ) for the first time .",
    "resolved are ( 1 ) mira s circumbinary dust envelope at the core of the astropause , ( 2 ) the termination shock where the stellar wind is slowed down by the ism and ( 3 ) the astrosheath in which a turbulent wake assumes the characteristic cometary shape beyond the termination shock .",
    "thus , the _ spitzer _",
    "@xmath7 data , in conjunction with previous multi - wavelength results , provide the most comprehensive view of the wind - ism interaction for an agb star to date .",
    "mira happened to be located at the northern edge of the _ xmm_-lss field in the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic legacy survey ( swire ; @xcite ) .",
    "far - infrared mapping of mira and its vicinity was performed on 2004 august 1 and 2 with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; @xcite ) . due to the relative position offset among the mips detectors in the focal plane , mira was scanned over only in the 24 and @xmath7 bands",
    "( scans 08 and 09 ; aor keys 5844992 , 5845248 , 11774976 and 11775232 ) .",
    "these scans were done at the medium rate along five scan legs of 3@xmath8 long each with a cross - scan stepping of 148@xmath9 .",
    "quick inspection of the archived data indicated that mira was saturated in both of the 24 and @xmath10 m bands : however , the @xmath10 m data appeared salvageable .",
    "data reduction was done in the following steps with the ge reprocessing tools ( gert ; ver .",
    "20060415 of s14 processing ) and the the mosaicker software ( ver .  20070615 ) .",
    "first , we used gert to create our own basic calibrated data ( bcd ) .",
    "bright sources can corrupt stimulator - response calibration if they happen to be on the detector when the calibrating stimulator is illuminated @xcite .",
    "thus , we excluded stimulator frames affected by bright mira to optimize the time - dependent detector responsivity calibration for our particular data set .",
    "we also adjusted the number of reads in the data ramp to recover valid data in otherwise saturated pixels .",
    "then , we applied a high - pass time median filter with a 50-detector - pixel width on the custom - made bcds to remove the `` streakings '' due to residual slow - response variations of the detector , while masking out a circular region around mira of 30-detector - pixel radius to avoid filtering out the extended structure around mira .",
    "finally , the custom - processed bcds were mosaicked into a single map with the mosaicker .",
    "the mips @xmath7 band is known to suffer from a short - wavelength light leak , which can result in a false point source offset from the position of the true @xmath7 source @xcite .",
    "inspection of the mosaicked mira map indicated that the emission core was elongated by the presence of a secondary point source offset from mira ( figure [ map]a ) .",
    "since mira s @xmath11 magnitude is @xmath12 ( more than 6 magnitudes above the limit over which the leak becomes detectable ) , the core elongation was most likely due to the leak . hence , we removed the light leak in the mira map by scaling and subtracting the image of a calibration k2iii star , hd 163588 , whose @xmath7 emission was known to be mostly the leak .",
    "this yielded a single - peaked , psf - like emission core .",
    "this method would inevitably subtract the photospheric component of hd 163588 ( estimated to be 56 mjy ) from mira .",
    "however , it was deemed negligible with respect to the flux of mira at @xmath7 ( 52 jy ) .",
    "figure [ map ] displays versions of the _ spitzer_/mips image of mira at @xmath7 in log - scaled false - color .",
    "these maps were made at the @xmath13 pix@xmath2 scale ( @xmath14 field of view ) with the mean sky coverage of @xmath15 pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the effect of saturation was not removed entirely by adjusting reads in the data ramp , and the @xmath13 pix@xmath2 scale turned out to be the minimum pixel scale for which all pixels register valid data . the one @xmath16 sensitivity and the average large - spatial - scale sky emission ( the component removed during the median filter )",
    "were found to be 0.8 and @xmath17 mjy sr@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the derived sky emission value was consistent with the estimated value of 6.5 mjy sr @xmath2 , which is obtained with the _ spitzer _ planning observations tool ( spot ) software .",
    "contours are 80 , 60 , 40 , 20 , 10 , 5 , 2.5 and 0.5@xmath18 of the emission peak , with the lowest contour corresponding to 3 @xmath16 ( @xmath19 mjy sr@xmath2 ) .    the light - leak - corrected image is presented in figure [ map]b , in which the emission core is evidently single - peaked .",
    "the leak - corrected emission profile of mira can be dissected into three distinct emission regions : the emission core , plateau and halo .",
    "the core is slightly extended with the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath20 at the position angle ( pa ; measured east from north ) of 70@xmath8 . since nearby point sources have the average fwhm of @xmath21 , the extension of the core appears genuine .",
    "the plateau is an elliptical region ( @xmath22 at the pa of 70@xmath8 ) of relatively flat profile encircling the core ( at 5% to 30% of the peak emission ) .",
    "the halo is a fainter nebulosity surrounding the plateau .",
    "if we define the periphery of the halo at 3 @xmath16 ( the lowest contour in figure [ map ] ) , then its extent is @xmath23 at the pa of 15@xmath8 .",
    "the scan - map direction is the pa of 160@xmath8 , along which some residual `` streakings '' are still recognizable below 3 @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the elongation of the @xmath7 emission around mira is not the artifact of scan mapping .",
    "mira has been imaged in the far - ir most recently with the _ akari infrared astronomy satellite _ @xcite .",
    "_ akari _ s mira maps are consistent with the _ spitzer _ map with a single - peaked emission core with extension at the pa of 15@xmath8 ( h.  izumiura et al .  2008 , private communication ) .",
    "the point - spread - function ( psf ) in the mips @xmath7 band has the first airy pattern out to @xmath24 ( at @xmath25 pixel@xmath2 ) at @xmath26 of the peak surface brightness .",
    "a synthesized psf was convolved with an elliptical gaussian function to conform the observed shape of the core and subtracted from the data ( figure [ map]c ) .",
    "we immediately see that there is still substantial emission ( @xmath27 mjy sr@xmath28 ) in the plateau , suggesting that it is caused by an elliptical ring of @xmath29 at the pa of 70@xmath8 .",
    "the core is oriented in the same way as the circumbinary co envelope @xcite , while the co envelope is smaller than the core @xcite . at the distance of 107 pc to mira @xcite ,",
    "the physical size of the co envelope is @xmath30 cm in radius .",
    "this agrees well with the expected radius of mira s molecular envelope resulted from mass loss at the rate of @xmath31 m@xmath32 yr@xmath2 @xcite , including the effect of photodissociation by the interstellar radiation field @xcite .",
    "therefore , the core represents mira s circumbinary dust envelope whose physical size is @xmath33 cm in radius .",
    "since the mira system is moving at @xmath34 km s@xmath2 the resulting wind - ism interaction has given rise to the ultraviolet bow shock structure @xcite , despite mira s slow wind velocity of 4 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "figures [ over]a and [ over]b clearly show that the downstream side of the ultraviolet bow shock coincides with the southern edge of the far - infrared halo .",
    "moreover , the cometary shape of the halo is the most consistent with the bow shock interpretation , in which the far - infrared nebulosity is shaped by a turbulent wake flowing almost due north .",
    "according to the theory of the ( solar)wind - ism interaction , the ism flow approaches supersonically toward mira , becomes subsonic past the bow shock and streams around the astropause , while mira s wind expands freely to form a bubble bounded by the termination shock , beyond which the wind becomes compressed and turbulent and flows downstream in the astrosheath @xcite .",
    "assuming that the @xmath7 emission probes mira s dusty wind emanating from the circumbinary envelope , we interpret that the leak - corrected , core - subtracted image distinguishes spatially all components of the astropause ( figure [ map]c ) with the halo tracing the astrosheath and the emission ring delineating the termination shock ( see , also , figure [ over]d ) .",
    "the prominent ultraviolet streams ( figures [ over]a and [ over]b ) are outflows of h@xmath35 excited collisionally by hot electrons in the bow - shock - excited ism flow @xcite .",
    "these h@xmath35 flows , therefore , must have penetrated the termination shock and been directed downstream while getting excited in the astrosheath . in the astrosheath , h@xmath6 can be dissociated by either the interstellar radiation field @xcite or collisional excitation @xcite . the observed emission",
    "is mostly concentrated in the vicinity of the termination shock , with the peak fwhm of @xmath36 @xcite , which is compatible with the size of the molecular radius given the resolution at 21 cm ( figure [ over]c ) .",
    "similar to h@xmath6 , atomic h is directed toward downstream beyond the termination shock , lending strong support for the multi - phase characteristics of the flow in the astrosheath .",
    "the stagnation point of the wind - ism interaction is therefore at the apex of the halo ( astropause ) , which is @xmath37 cm from mira . requiring ram pressure balance at the stagnation point",
    ", this implies that the ism density local to mira is @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "this value is consistent with the result of a two - wind model @xcite that accounts for mira s entry into the local bubble , the region of warm ( @xmath40 k ) , tenuous ( @xmath41 @xmath39 ) ism in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "given @xmath42 @xmath43 and 25% abundance of neutral species @xcite , we can estimate the optical depth at @xmath7 to be @xmath44 assuming a power - index scaling law with the index of 1.2 ( i.e. silicate dust ) . under the assumption that thermal dust emission dominates at @xmath7 , the emission map and the optical depth yield the temperature of dust ; @xmath45 k in the circumbinary dust envelope , @xmath46 k in the termination shock and @xmath47 k in the astrosheath .",
    "based on these estimates , the pre - shock temperature of mira s wind is thought to be @xmath27 k ( assuming gas - dust thermalization ) , implying mach number of 7.5 . with the generalized jump relations ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the velocity of the termination shock is @xmath48 km s@xmath2 in mira s frame and the ratio of post- to pre - shock densities 3.8 .",
    "these values yield the post - shock gas temperature of @xmath49 k. thus , in the shock - excited astrosheath , dust is still present ( the gas temperature is below the condensation temperature of silicates @xmath50 k ; @xcite ) , but probably de - thermalized from gas .",
    "spectroscopic follow - ups are necessary to investigate the evolution of the dust - gas characteristics upon passage of the termination shock .    at 2 km",
    "s@xmath2 , the termination shock should have taken @xmath51 yr to advance to the present position ( @xmath52 cm ) from the astropause ( @xmath37 cm ) .",
    "the total flux of the astrosheath ( including the termination shock ) is 37 jy , and this translates to the total mass of @xmath53 m@xmath32 using the dust emissivity of generic interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "with mira s mass loss rate ( @xmath54 m@xmath32 yr@xmath2 ; @xcite ) , it should have taken @xmath51 yr for the astrosheath to form .",
    "these estimates for the age of the termination shock is consistent with the time needed for the termination shock to re - establish itself after entering the local bubble ( @xmath51 yr ) as estimated numerically by @xcite , who attributed a kink in mira s ultraviolet tail @xcite to mira s entry into the local bubble .",
    "the presence of the bow shock indicates that the outer shock is supersonic . in the warm ( @xmath55 k ) ,",
    "tenuous ( @xmath41 @xmath39 ) local bubble @xcite , however , the shock velocity of @xmath34 km s@xmath2 is barely supersonic .",
    "this suggests that the pre- and post - shock parameters across the bow shock are nearly continuous .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the ultraviolet emission profile does not indicate any density enhancement ( i.e.  material pile - up ) at the southern edge of the bow .",
    "hence , ultraviolet emission in front of the upstream face of the astropause is due to excitation of the post - shock ism gas by a shear flow .",
    "while mira s wind and the ism gas flow are in general separated by the astropause , these flows are inherently turbulent .",
    "thus , these flows are mixed in the downstream wake and h@xmath6 is collisionally excited , resulting in the observed far - ultraviolet emission .",
    "excited h@xmath6 can be dissociated , leading to the observed emission .",
    "dust grains help h@xmath6 to replenish in the wake , and this cool , turbulent three - phase gas flow results in emission of h@xmath6 and continuing at least for 1.5@xmath8 long .",
    "hence , there is an emerging picture of mira s astropause ( figure [ over]d ) .",
    "the extent of the far - infrared emission outlines the astropause , which is the contact surface between mira s molecular wind and the ism flow .",
    "the bulk of the halo emission is due to dusty molecular wind material in the astrosheath , shock - excited by the termination shock delineated by the emission ring .",
    "the termination shock is the discontinuous interface between the pre- and post - shock regions of mira s wind , inside which mira s wind expands undisturbed coming off the circumbinary envelope hosting bipolar outflows .",
    "since the post - shock regions of both mira s wind and the ism flow have a significant physical size , the shock must be non - radiative ( i.e. , it has not been cooled down and compressed into an unresolvable size ) .",
    "according to @xcite , in a collisionally excited solar wind abundance gas heating dominates cooling below 10@xmath56 k ( their fig",
    "the estimated post - shock gas temperature of mira s wind is @xmath49 k. thus , the post - shock gas can indeed maintain its temperature , i.e. , its physical size . because previous numerical models ( @xcite ) were concerned mainly with the structure of the turbulent wake of the wind - ism interaction , follow - up multi - phase hydrodynamical modeling at low temperatures to reproduce the structure of the astropause appears extremely worthwhile .",
    "the total flux of the astropause is 52 jy , which implies the total mass of @xmath57 m@xmath32 using the dust emissivity of generic interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "since the total atomic mass in the astropause is @xmath58 m@xmath32 @xcite , the total molecular mass is estimate to be @xmath59 m@xmath32 to be roughly 1 to 9 atomic - to - molecular mass ratio .",
    "the observed far - ultraviolet luminosity implies the h@xmath35 dissociation rate of @xmath60 s@xmath2 , if collisional excitation accounts for all far - ultraviolet emission @xcite .",
    "this rate , however , would have yielded a factor of four more atomic h than observed @xcite .",
    "dust grains can potentially provide h@xmath35 formation sites to reduce excess atomic h. using parameters of gas in the astrosheath ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 k ) and silicate grains ( @xmath63 radius , 3.7 g cc@xmath2 , 1% mass ratio ) , the h@xmath6 formation rate is approximately @xmath64 s@xmath2 , if one assumes that an encounter with two atomic h by a dust grain always results in production of h@xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that h@xmath6 far - ultraviolet emission is not entirely due to collision of h@xmath6 with hot electrons and by some other means as already implied @xcite and/or there exist some mechanisms to bolster production of h@xmath6 from atomic h.    clearly , mira s astropause presents a unique laboratory for investigations of a multi - phase hydrodynamical flow , turbulence and dust - gas processing , which has a profound impact on the chemical makeup of the ism . because recent findings suggest that wind - ism interaction around agb stars may be common @xcite , spatially resolved spectroscopy of multi - phase dusty , low - temperature gas flow will be extremely productive in the coming era of herschel , sofia and alma ( e.g.  @xcite , respectively ) .",
