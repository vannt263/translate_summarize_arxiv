    "in einstein s general theory of relativity , close pairs of stars produce gravitational waves , ripples in the curvature of space - time @xcite . observations of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 confirm the slow decay of the orbit predicted by einstein s theory and provide indirect evidence for gravitational waves @xcite . on - going and",
    "proposed instruments seek to detect gravitational waves directly @xcite .",
    "the strongest known gravitational wave sources are compact binaries containing neutron stars and wds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are presently four known binaries with orbital periods less than 15 minutes  three am cvn stars @xcite and one low mass x - ray binary @xcite  but all binaries with @xmath11 hr orbital periods , with one exception @xcite , are interacting systems that complicate direct tests of einstein s theory .",
    "@xcite show that the expected period change due to gravitational wave radiation can be modified by both induction - driven angular momentum interchange in magnetic wd systems and by mass - transfer in accreting systems .",
    "moreover , there are different explanations for both the nature of the shortest - period am cvn systems and their observed period changes @xcite .    here , we report the discovery of a detached , 765 sec orbital period binary , sdss j065133.33 + 284423.3 ( hereafter j0651 ) .",
    "the discovery comes from our on - going elm survey , a targeted spectroscopic survey for extremely low mass @xmath10.25  wds @xcite .",
    "the elm survey demonstrates that extremely low mass wds are found in compact binaries , and that the majority of these binaries have @xmath110 gyr merger times due to gravitational wave radiation @xcite .",
    "depending on the poorly constrained physics of the merger process , these merging wd systems may produce single helium - rich sdo stars , stable mass - transfer am cvn binaries , or possibly underluminous supernova ( as discussed in * ? ? ?",
    ". the observed merger rate of the low mass wd binaries is about 1% of the type ia supernovae rate ",
    "comparable to the rate of underluminous supernovae @xcite .",
    "the elm survey is also responsible for finding the first tidally distorted wd @xcite .",
    "j0651 is the most extreme system discovered to date and shows that the elm survey may open a new window on gravitational wave sources .    in j0651 ,",
    "the orientation of the binary allows us to observe eclipses of each star by the other , leading to accurate measurement of the orbital parameters , masses , and wd radii .",
    "there is no evidence for mass transfer .",
    "these results suggest that j0651 is the cleanest known strong gravitational wave source , with an orbital decay time of less than 1 myr .",
    "future observations will allow us to measure the change in the orbital period .",
    "we hope to one day compare this change with direct measurements of gravitational waves and provide an unprecedented test of general relativity .",
    "we discovered j0651 on 2011 march 2 as part of our targeted spectroscopic survey for extremely low mass wds using the 6.5 m mmt telescope .",
    "we used the mmt blue channel spectrograph @xcite to obtain 1   resolution spectra in the wavelength range 3600   - 4500  .",
    "we recognized j0651 as a low mass wd due to its pressure - broadened hydrogen balmer lines , seen in figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "spectral fits to hydrogen atmosphere wd models @xcite yield a surface gravity of @xmath2 dex ( @xmath3 in cm s@xmath4 ) and an effective temperature of @xmath5 k. the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) spectrum of this object , on the other hand , yields a systematically larger @xmath6 dex and @xmath7 k ( s.  j.  kleinman 2011 , private communication ) because the sdss exposure spans 3.5 orbital periods and thus measures artificially broadened balmer lines .",
    "our own 6 - 10 min exposures of j0651 show similarly over - estimated surface gravities and temperatures .",
    "a correct understanding of j0651 requires time - resolved spectroscopy only possible with a larger telescope like the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] compares our best - fit model atmosphere to dereddened ( @xmath8 = 0.0706 mag ) ultraviolet galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) photometry @xcite , optical sdss photometry , and our own near - infrared @xmath9 mag measurement obtained with swirc @xcite on the mmt .",
    "the broadband photometry supports our spectroscopic effective temperature and surface gravity measurement with one possible exception .",
    "the galex nuv point shows a 2-@xmath10 discrepancy with the model spectrum convolved with the filter bandpass , however the photometric error does not include the significant uncertainty in the extinction correction for galex filters @xcite and so we consider the discrepancy suspect . comparison with",
    "wd evolutionary tracks @xcite indicates that j0651 is consistent with an extremely low mass 0.25   helium - core wd .",
    "we discovered that j0651 is a compact binary system when back - to - back spectra separated by 6 min showed a @xmath111300  change in radial velocity ( figure [ fig : rv ] ) . despite the faintness of the @xmath12 wd , the light - gathering power of the 6.5 m mmt telescope allowed us to reduce our exposure times to 2 - 2.5 minutes and resolve the orbital period .",
    "the data are presented in table [ tab : dat ] .",
    "the observed velocity amplitude is an underestimate , however , because 1 ) our exposures span 18% of orbital phase and 2 ) the radial velocity curve is sinusoidal , not linear . by integrating a sine curve at the phase covered by our exposures , we determine that the velocity amplitude correction is 5.5% .",
    "the observed velocity amplitude is also underestimated if the wd is tidally distorted and its center - of - light differs from its center - of - mass .",
    "we do not correct for this effect given that the velocity correction is less than 1%  comparable to our measurement uncertainty  for the observed oblateness .",
    "the best - fit orbital parameters to the radial velocities are : period @xmath13 sec , corrected velocity semi - amplitude @xmath14 , and systemic velocity @xmath15 .",
    "j0651 is very likely a galactic disk object based on its small proper motion @xmath16 mas yr@xmath17 @xcite and small systemic velocity .",
    "j0651 s location 220 pc above the plane ( for a distance of 1 kpc , see below ) is also consistent with a disk object .",
    "we obtained time - series optical photometry of j0651 using the mcdonald 2.1 m otto struve telescope using the argos frame transfer camera @xcite .",
    "images were obtained with a _",
    "bg40 _ schott glass filter .",
    "our set of 3,038 10- and 15-second exposures come from five different nights in 2011 april covering a total time baseline of 12.1 days . the observed light curve , phased to the best - fit period , is plotted in figure [ fig : lc ] and shows three significant features : a sinusoidal pattern due to ellipsoidal variations from the tidally distorted wd , an asymmetric peak in light due to relativistic beaming ( so - called doppler boosting ) , and periodic dips in light from the eclipses of the primary and secondary wds .",

    "jktebop and phoebe are based on the eclipsing binary orbit program @xcite and the @xcite codes , respectively .",
    "we first remove the 0.5% doppler boosting ( relativistic beaming ) signal , however , because neither code models doppler boosting .",
    "doppler boosting has been seen in only a handful of systems @xcite ; its asymmetric contribution to the j0651 light curve confirms the 765 sec orbital period .",

    "reflection effects due to the heating of each wd by its companion are weak , 0.3%@xmath180.4% .    the light curve yields a much more precise measurement of orbital period , @xmath19 sec .",
    "the ellipsoidal variations are due to the changing projected area of the distorted primary wd , hence they strongly depend on the inclination angle of the binary system .",

    "the unseen secondary has a mass of 0.55  and an observed radius of 0.0132@xmath180.0003  typical for a carbon - oxygen wd .",

    "there are only two other model - independent mass and radius determinations of helium and carbon - oxygen wds @xcite .",

    "j0651 is among the strongest known gravitational wave sources and , more importantly , has an orbital frequency that places it well above the expected gravitational wave foreground @xcite .",
    "the proposed esa / nasa laser interferometer space antenna ( _ lisa _ ) mission has its peak sensitivity at frequencies corresponding to @xmath115 min orbital periods , and it should detect a strain of @xmath0 at these frequencies with a signal - to - noise of @xmath11100 in one year @xcite .",
    "in other words , j0651 is a verification source that _ lisa _ , if built , would detect in the first week of operation .",
    "we also predict that j0651 s orbital period is shrinking by @xmath31 sec per year due to gravitational wave radiation .",

    "when we measure this change we expect to provide yet another fundamental test of general relativity and the existence of gravitational waves .",

    "the spectrum and light curve of sn 2005e , for example , can be explained by the detonation of a 0.2  helium layer on a 0.45  wd @xcite  parameters very similar to the j0651 system .",
    "depending on the nature of the mass transfer , there may be other mechanisms by which the system could detonate @xcite .",
