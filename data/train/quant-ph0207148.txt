    "the condition for the resolvent to be singular is that all the @xmath76 repetitions are exactly in phase , @xmath77 which is just the initial bohr - sommerfeld quantization .",
    "thus , the periodic orbit evaluation of the map resolvent retrieves the full berry - tabor equivalence without any need to consider boundary corrections to the trace .",
    "the reason why this works is that the singularities of the resolvent only manifest themselves by summing the periodic contributions for very long times , or multiple repetitions . for these contributions",
    "there is an effective increase of the large parameter of the stationary phase evaluation of @xmath24 given by ( [ eval ] ) .",
    "the integrals are then dominated by a very narrow region near each periodic orbit , so that the boundary can be ignored for the high repetition of an orbit even if it lies almost at the edge .",
    "the evaluation of the spectral determinant may be regarded as a resummation of the semiclassical sum for the poles of the resolvent , such that the ( discrete ) time of the contributing periodic orbits is cut - off by the dimension of the finite hilbert space .",
    "we show in the next section that the error in the traces of the propagator due to the edge corrections can be magnified by the spectral determinant .",
    "to illustrate the calculation of the spectral determinant , we choose the simplest hamiltonian that is a nonlinear function of the action , namely @xmath78 the periodic orbit condition ( [ deriv ] ) then reduces to @xmath79 and the stationary phase evaluation of the trace assumes the explicit form @xmath80 \\ .\\ ] ]    for the case where the parameter @xmath81 ( i.e. one of the quantized actions ) , @xmath24 reduces to a `` curlicue '' .",
    "these recursively spiraling patterns in the complex plane were shown by berry and goldberg  @xcite to have quite diverse characteristics depending on @xmath82 , in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "this may also be the case for non - quantized @xmath84 .",
    "two essentially different regions of the eigenspectrum can be studied . in case ( i ) ,",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "notice that the stationary phase approximation to the integrals in ( [ trace ] ) would be exact for the quadratic model if the limits could be extended to @xmath94 .",
    "in other words , the edge corrections are the only deviation of the periodic orbit approximation with respect to the exact trace . these corrections are certainly not negligible for stroboscopic parameters such that a periodic orbit is close to one of the edges .",

    "however , the final result is no better than the one without symmetrizing at all .    by shifting the parameters in case ( ii ) so",
    "that @xmath0 becomes almost linear , within the interval @xmath52 , the agreement between the different approaches becomes much more reasonable than in figure [ fig : rootscusp ] .",

    ", one could expect that spectral determinants would still be more successful tools for integrable spectra than the trace formula , since they take some account of unitarity and here the classical periodic orbit structure is much simpler than for chaotic systems .",
