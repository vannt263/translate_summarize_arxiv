    "to design active optical devices such as sensors , switches and modulators , one needs to calculate how a small change in refractive index affects the device response function . for active devices based on dielectric structures described by a frequency - independent dielectric constant distribution @xmath0",
    ", the effect of an index change can be understood in terms of a frequency shift @xmath1 of the eigenmodes of the system , which is given by first - order perturbation theory as : @xmath2 the numerator in eq .",
    "( 1 ) only has contributions from the perturbed regions as described by @xmath3 .",
    "the shift in the eigenfrequency thus depends on the overlap of the modal electric field energy with the perturbed region .    in recent years",
    ", there has been substantial interest in using plasmonics for active devices . while surface - plasmon sensors are already prominent in biochemical sensing applications , remarkable improvements in device performance have been achieved using plasmonic nanostructures and metamaterials .",
    "active plasmonic devices have also been implemented for modulation and switching . given these developments , it is essential to develop a general photonic perturbation theory for plasmonic nanophotonic structures to firmly ground the analysis and characterization of next - generation devices .",
    "( 1 ) , however , is not applicable for plasmonic systems .",
    "for example , @xmath0 can be negative in a metal system , and hence directly applying eq .",
    "( 1 ) could lead to a prediction of infinite sensitivity , which is unphysical .",
    "moreover , in plasmonic systems , recent experiments have successfully varied the plasma frequency of the metal as well , introducing a new degree of freedom that requires formal theoretical treatment .    in this paper , we build upon a formulation recently developed to model the photonic band structure of dispersive material systems,@xcite to construct a perturbation theory that can predict modal frequency shifts due to changes in the dielectric constants of dispersive systems involving both metals and dielectrics .",
    "we also show that a similar perturbation theory can be developed when the plasma frequency of the dispersive metal is modulated , and highlight new physical behavior related to such modulation .",
    "our theory thus allows us to treat variations in key parameters of both metal and dielectric components of plasmonic nanostructures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review the photonic band theory previously developed to describe dispersive metamaterials and plasmonic nanostructures .",
    "we develop a general perturbation theory in section iii to describe the effect of small parameter changes on the optical modes of dispersive nanostructures .",
    "we consider the specific cases of refractive - index variation in section iv , and plasma frequency variation in section v , and demonstrate the accuracy of this perturbation theory numerically for both cases by comparing to direct calculations .",
    "finally , we conclude in section vi .",
    "as the basis for the developments of this paper , we first briefly review the theory recently developed to model the photonic modes of dispersive material systems.@xcite this theory is applicable for a nanophotonic structure containing a dispersive material with a dielectric function @xmath4    to describe such a dispersive material , for the @xmath5-th pole in the dielectric function , one introduces a polarization field @xmath6 and a polarization velocity field @xmath7 , satisfying @xmath8 these auxiliary fields are then coupled to maxwell s equations through : @xmath9    for steady state , with fields varying as @xmath10 , eqs .

    "eqs . - also define a total energy density @xmath13 the spatial integral of eq . , which represents the total energy of the system , is conserved when @xmath14 for all poles .",
    "further , defining @xmath15 , which represents a multi - component vector field varying over the whole space , we can write eqs . - as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18    finally , defining @xmath19 , we can re - write this as an eigenvalue equation for @xmath12 : @xmath20 for the lossless case , @xmath14 , eq . becomes a hermitian eigenvalue equation which results in an orthogonality condition : @xmath21 = \\delta_{ab}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we develop a general perturbation theory based on the generalized eigenvalue equation for the photonic bands of dispersive nanostructures , eq . .",
    "we start from the unperturbed system @xmath22 in the presence of a perturbation , the system matrices become @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , and as a result , we have @xmath25 using eq . and keeping only first - order terms in eq . , we have @xmath26 eq . , in its most general form , describes a lossy system and can not be written as a hermitian eigenvalue problem .",
    "thus , to calculate @xmath1 we also need to determine the left eigenvector @xmath27 that satisfies @xmath28 multiplying @xmath27 through eq . and solving for @xmath1 , we find : @xmath29 eq .",
    "is the main result of this paper . in the following sections",
    ", we apply this equation to two relevant examples of perturbations in plasmonic systems .",
    "in this section we consider the specific case of a small change ( @xmath30 ) in the dielectric constant of a dielectric region , in a nanostructure consisting of both metal and dielectric regions .",
    "the metal region is assumed to be unperturbed . in this case , the perturbation takes the form @xmath31 while @xmath32 .",
    "we now determine the change in modal frequency for the cases when the metal in the metal - dielectric nanostructure is lossless and lossy .      for the lossless case eq .",
    "both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are hermitian . in this case , from eq .",

    "( 1 ) that is now appropriate for a system with dispersion , provided that we consider the _ total _ energy density in the system including contributions from the auxiliary mechanical fields .",
    "the expression for total energy , eq . , has contributions from multiple lorentz poles and is a multi - pole extension of the energy density expression previously derived by taking electric polarization into account explicitly .",
    "for the lossless case this reduces to the usual expression for energy density in metals@xcite @xmath37 |\\mathbf{e}|^{2 } + \\frac{\\mu_0}{4 } | \\mathbf{h } |^2 .\\ ] ]      for the lossy case , the matrix @xmath34 in eq . is no longer hermitian and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , eq . in this case reduces to : @xmath40 while no explicit expression analogous to eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be written for the lossy case , eq .",
    "still allows one to calculate the frequency shift due to a dielectric refractive index change in the presence of a lossy metal ; an important ability in realistic plasmonic sensing schemes .",
    "represents the technically correct way to do perturbation theory , where one needs to determine both the left and right eigenvectors of the general eigenvalue problem .",
    "moreover the denominator in eq . can not be interpreted as an energy integral .",
    "empirically , on the other hand , we will show numerically that in fact @xmath41 , even for metals with realistic loss parameters , and thus the denominator of eq .",
    ", @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the energy density of the mode for the lossy system as defined in eq . , which includes contributions from the mechanical auxiliary fields .",
    "we note that in a lossy system , when multiple poles are involved , there is no simple relation such as eq .",
    "that can be used to describe the total energy . instead",
    ", the definition of eq . , which explicitly takes into account contributions from the auxiliary mechanical fields , must be used .",
    "we now numerically verify the accuracy of the perturbation theory results presented .",

    "we note the presence of dispersion - less flat bands below @xmath65 that correspond to surface plasmon modes , and modes that have substantial group velocity which correspond to non - surface modes . for both cases",

    ", we analyze a potential refractive - index sensing scheme by calculating the reflection / transmission spectrum of 50-layers of the plasmonic rod system considered above , using a full - field 2d finite - difference frequency - domain ( fdfd ) simulation.@xcite the plasmonic metal , corresponding as before to the two - pole fit of silver s dielectric function , is assumed to be lossless for the purposes of this illustration . for the tm case , below the cutoff frequency @xmath61 [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , no propagating modes are supported .",
    "thus , the structure is strongly reflecting .",
    "the lowest - frequency dip in the reflection spectrum [ fig .",

    "2(a ) at @xmath61 . we can then examine the shift in this reflectivity dip when the dielectric surrounding the rods is changed by @xmath72 ( due to , for example , the introduction of a biochemical analyte ) .",

    "we calculate the shift of the lowest - frequency mode at @xmath74 , for the same @xmath72 , to be @xmath70 , which matches well with the shift observed in the full - field simulation .",
    "thus , the perturbation theory with respect to the eigenmodes of the system can be used to predict shifts in features of the same system s transmission and reflection spectra .",
    "in this section we demonstrate that we can also treat small changes in the plasma frequency of a metal present in a plasmonic nanostructure .",
    "this is of interest given a recent experimental work with ito@xcite where an applied electric field induced a change in carrier concentration thereby changing its plasma frequency and behavior at optical frequencies .",
    "in other recent work , the infrared plasmonic resonance of a metallic nanostructure ( split - ring resonators ) immersed in an electrolyte was affected by applying a voltage that altered the structure s average electron bulk density.@xcite    to derive an expression for the modal frequency change in such situations , without loss of generality , we will assume that only the @xmath75-th pole experiences a plasma frequency modulation .",
    "then , we note that to first order the effect of @xmath76 affects our matrix elements by @xmath77 . with this",
    "established we now separately consider the lossless and lossy cases .",
    "for the lossless case the following perturbing matrices , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are applicable : @xmath80 @xmath81 since the eigenvalue equation eq .",
    "is hermitian for the lossless case , eq . becomes : @xmath82 which reduces to the following expression in terms of the constituent fields ( as determined by solving eq .",
    "): @xmath83    the frequency shift @xmath1 for a given mode is thus directly proportional to the strength of the modal mechanical field in the @xmath75-th pole that is undergoing modulation , and the proximity of the unperturbed modal frequency @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "of particular interest is that , assuming @xmath86 , @xmath1 is positive or negative depending on whether the unperturbed modal frequency is above or below the lorentz pole s resonance frequency @xmath85 .",
    "we verify this behavior numerically in section c below .      as noted in the previous section , for the lossy case , eq .",
