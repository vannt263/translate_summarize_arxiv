    "see the bibliography and also the wikipedia item on the `` angel problem '' .",
    "let us make the devil a little stronger",
    ". instead of jumping a distance @xmath1 in one step , assume that the angel makes at most one ( vertical or horizontal ) step at a time , but the devil can deposit only a weight of size @xmath2 in one step .",

    "the angel needs a strategy that works on all scales , to make sure she is not surrounded in the short term as well as in the long term .",
    "let us try to develop a strategy for her on the scale of @xmath21-colonies , while taking for granted certain possibilities for her on the scale of @xmath22-colonies . in the context of @xmath21-colonies the @xmath22-colonies will be called _ _ .",
    "a @xmath15-colony @xmath23 can be broken up into rows @xmath24 .",

    "there is not even a single bad cell , and at most one cell can be close to badness , the other ones will be `` safe '' .",
    "if the row is `` very '' good then even the single square close to badness will not be spoiled soon .",

    ".    then we may be able to pass from @xmath23 to @xmath27 along column @xmath29 , passing to it in row @xmath30 . by the time we arrive into @xmath27 it may not be safe anymore but it is still clean , and we can pass into a clean row @xmath31 in it .",
    "this simple scheme of passing from one big colony to the next will be called a _ _ .",
    "this scheme has many holes yet , and we will fix them one - by - one , adding new and new complications . fortunately the process converges .",
    "let us look at some of the issues .",
    "@xmath32    1 .",
    "[ i.time-bound-idea ] the digression along row @xmath30 to get into column @xmath29 causes a delay .",
    "if our delays are not under control ( especially in a recursive scheme like ours ) then the devil gains too much time and can put down too much weight .",
    "let @xmath17 be a path of cells ( viewed as a union of cells ) .",
    "we will bound the time along it by the following expression : @xmath33 the term @xmath34 is essentially the sum of the lengths of the straight runs of cells in @xmath17 : we call it the _",
    "cost_. now when the angel makes a digression along row @xmath30 to get to column @xmath29 it had a reason _ outside _ its path of cells : namely , she could not pass straight in column @xmath35 , because of some weight @xmath36 in this column . we will upperbound the extra geometric cost by @xmath37",
    ". so the above sum can be estimated as @xmath38 this is how we `` make the devil pay '' for causing a digression : the time bound formula is conserved when passing from the lower to the higher scale .",
    "2 .   even in a clean row",
    "there is possibly one cell that is not safe , in which we do not want to `` land '' but which we need to `` pass through '' .",
    "so we have to look at the situation of three @xmath21-colonies on top of each other , the bottom one , @xmath23 still clean , the top one , @xmath27 still safe , but about the middle one we know only that the union of the three big colonies together is good .",
    "it is in the nature of the game that we will have to tackle a situation like this without advance guarantee that we will be able to arrive at the top .",
    "we have to attempt it and may fail , ending up possibly where we started ( but then knowing that the devil had to spend a lot of his capital on this ) .",
    "the strategy will be essentially to try to pass in each column .",
    "because of the cleanness of @xmath23 there is always a clean row to fall back to .",
    "this scheme of attempted passage will be called an _ _ .",
    "its implementation uses attacks on the cell level .",
    "3 .   in the implementation of attacks",
    ", we must be careful about the idea of `` falling back to '' a clean row , since the time bound introduced above assumes that the path we use is _ not self - intersecting_. the attack must be implemented with some care to achieve this .",
    "we introduce some primitive `` moves '' for the angel that incorporate some of the possible retreating steps .",
    "also , to avoid retreat when it is not really needed , we introduce the notion of a `` continuing attack '' , which continues from the result of a failed attack in the eastern neighbor column without falling back .",
    "4 .   with the extra kinds of move a self - nonintersecting implementation can be achieved , but there is still a problem . the delay ( extra geometric cost ) of the attacks can not always be charged directly to some mass outside the path of cells .",
    "fortunately the case when it can not is an attack on the level of @xmath21-colonies containing many failed attacks on the level of @xmath22-colonies .",
    "a failed attack has a lot of mass _ inside it _ , and part of it can be used to pay for the extra geometric cost . in our new time bound formula therefore if there are @xmath39 failed attacks they will a contribute a `` profit '' ( negative cost ) : @xmath40 this will be sufficient to account for all the digressions .",
    "let us proceed to the formal constructions .      for our hierarchical solution",
    ", we generalize the angel - devil game into a game called ad - game .",
    "a union @xmath41 of ( horizontally or vertically ) adjacent squares of equal size will be called a _ _ .",
