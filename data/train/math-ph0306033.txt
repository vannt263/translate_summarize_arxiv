    "the main aim of this paper is to discuss a limiting relation between two classes of generalized schrdinger operators in @xmath1 .",
    "one of them are measure - type perturbations of the laplacian , in particular , we will be interested in potentials which are a negative multiple of the dirac measure supported by a finite graph @xmath4 , in other words , they are formally given by the expression @xmath5 with some @xmath6 .",
    "we are going to show that such operators can be approximated in the strong resolvent sense by families of point - interaction hamiltonians @xcite with two - dimensional @xmath3 potentials suitably arranged .",
    "stated in this way the problem is an interesting mathematical question ; the indicated result will represent an extension the approximation theorem derived in @xcite to the two - dimensional situation , which is not straightforward because properties of the @xmath3 potentials are dimension - dependent .",
    "in addition , we have a strong physical motivation coming from the fact that hamiltonians of the type ( [ formal ] ) are good models of various graph - type nanostructures which in distinction to the usual description @xcite take quantum tunneling into account  see @xcite for a bibliography to this problem .    to investigate such models one has to find spectral properties of the operator ( [ formal ] ) for various shapes of @xmath2 .",
    "this is in general a complicated task even if the original pde problems is reformulated by means of the generalized birman - schwinger principle @xcite into solution of an appropriate integral equation . on the other hand , spectral problem for point - interaction hamiltonians",
    "is reduced in a standard way to solution of an algebraic equation with coefficients containing values of the free green function .",
    "hence an approximation of the mentioned type would be of practical importance ; our second aim is to illustrate this aspect of the problem on examples .",
    "let us describe briefly contents of the paper .",
    "in the next section we collect the needed preliminaries stated in a way suitable for the further argument . in section  [ main result ]",
    "we formulate and prove our main result , which is the approximation indicated above . in the following two sections we discuss examples of two simple graph classes .",
    "the first are graphs of the form of a ring , full or open . in this case the spectrum of the operator ( [ formal ] ) can be found by mode matching @xcite which enables us to compare the approximation with the `` exact '' result , in particular , to assess the rate of its convergence .",
    "in contrast , in section  [ stargraph ] we discuss star - shaped graphs . here",
    "an alternative method for numerical solution of the spectral problem is missing , however , we can derive several conclusions for ( an infinite ) star analytically and show how does the approximation results conform with them .",
    "computations of this type were performed already in @xcite but the number of points used there was too small to provide a reasonable approximation .    in the last section we address another question which is more difficult and no analytical results are available presently .",
    "it concerns the scattering problem on infinite leaky graphs with asymptotically straight `` leads '' . on a heuristic level",
    ", it is natural to expect that the states from the negative part of the continuous spectrum can propagate being transversally confined to the graph edges , hence a nontrivial geometry should yield an @xmath7 on - shell scattering matrix , where @xmath8 is the number of the leads .",
    "this remains to be proved , however , and even more difficult it will be to compute the s - matrix mentioned above in terms of the graph geometry .    for simplicity we will restrict ourselves to the simplest case when @xmath2 is an infinite asymptotically straight curve , i.e. @xmath9 , without self - intersections .",
    "one natural conjecture is that if the distance between the curve points is small somewhere so that @xmath2 is close to a loop shape locally , the system can exhibit resonances due to quantum tunneling . on the other hand ,",
    "simple bends are unlikely to produce distinguished resonances ; the reason is that the transverse @xmath3 coupling in ( [ formal ] ) has a single bound state , hence there is no analog here to higher thresholds which give rise to resonances in bent hard - wall tubes @xcite . to support these conjectures ,",
    "we have let us inspire by the so - called @xmath10 approach to resonances , which was in the one - dimensional case set on a rigorous ground in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we study the spectrum of a finite segment of @xmath2 as a function of the cut - off position . in the first case we find in this dependence",
    "avoided eigenvalue crossings , the more narrow the smaller the gap to tunnel is , while no such effect is seen in the second case .    on the other hand ,",
    "a tunneling between arcwise distant points of the graphs is not the only source of resonances . to illustrate this claim , we analyze in our last example a z - shaped graph with two sharp bends separated by a line segment .",
    "we find again avoided crossings the widths of which vary widely as functions of the bending angle .",
    "this provides an indirect but convincing indication that the above described on - shell s - matrix for a bent curve in the shape of a broken line is nontrivial .",
    "we start with the definition of schrdinger operators of the form @xmath11 in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a finite positive measure on the borel @xmath14-algebra of @xmath2 , which is assumed to be a non - empty closed subset of @xmath15 and also the support of the measure @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath16 is a bounded and continuous function , acting from @xmath2 to @xmath17 .",
    "we suppose that the measure @xmath13 belongs to the generalized kato class , in two - dimensional case it means that the following condition holds , @xmath18 centered at @xmath19 .    due to the fact that the measure @xmath13 belongs to kato class , for each @xmath20 there exists @xmath21 such that any @xmath22 from the schwartz space @xmath23 satisfies the inequality @xmath24 as it was proven in the paper @xcite .",
    "since @xmath23 is dense in @xmath25 we can define a bounded linear transformation @xmath26 using this transformation , the inequality ( [ m estimate ] ) can be extended to the whole @xmath25 with the function @xmath22 on l.h.s .",
    "replaced by @xmath27 . by employing the klmn theorem ,",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "x.17 ) , we conclude that the quadratic form @xmath28 given by @xmath29 is lower semi - bounded and closed in @xmath12 .",
    "hence there exists a unique self - adjoint operator @xmath30 associated with the form @xmath28 .",
    "the described definition applies to more general class of measures than we need here .",
    "if @xmath2 is a graph consisting of a locally finite number of smooth edges meeting at nonzero angles , i.e. having no cusps , there is another way to define @xmath30 , namely via boundary conditions imposed on the wavefunctions . to this aim ,",
    "consider first the operator @xmath31 acting as @xmath32 for any @xmath22 of the domain consisting of functions which belong to @xmath33 , are continuous at @xmath2 with the normal derivatives having there a jump , @xmath34 then it is straightforward to check that @xmath31 is e.s.a . and",
    "by green s formula it reproduces the form @xmath35 on its core , so its closure may be identified with @xmath36 defined above .",
    "an important tool to analyze spectra of such operators is the generalized birman - schwinger method . if @xmath37 belongs to the resolvent set of @xmath30 we put @xmath38 .",
    "the free resolvent @xmath39 is defined for @xmath40 as an integral operator with the kernel @xmath41 now we shall use @xmath39 to define three other operators . for the sake of generality ,",
    "suppose that @xmath42 are positive radon measures on @xmath15 with @xmath43 for any @xmath44",
    ". in our case they will be the measure @xmath13 on @xmath2 and the lebesgue measure @xmath45 on @xmath15 in different combinations . by @xmath46",
    "we denote the integral operator from @xmath47 to @xmath48 with the kernel @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 holds @xmath51-a.e . for all @xmath52 .    with this notation",
    "one can express the resolvent @xmath53 as follows @xcite :    [ gen krein ] let @xmath40 .",
    "suppose that @xmath54 is invertible and the operator @xmath55^{-1 } r^k_{m,{{\\rm d}}x}\\ ] ] from @xmath12 to @xmath12 is everywhere defined .",
    "then @xmath37 belongs to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the invertibility hypothesis is satisfied for all sufficiently large negative @xmath37 because for such a @xmath37 the operator norm of @xmath58 acting in @xmath59 is less than 1 , see again @xcite , and similar result can be proven for the operator norm in @xmath60 following @xcite . thus from now on we consider @xmath61 such that both these norms are less than one .    for later considerations it is useful we rewrite operator @xmath62 in the form @xmath63 , where we have introduced @xmath64 since function @xmath16 acquires only non - negative values and @xmath13 is positive measure , @xmath65 is a positive number .",
    "the resolvent reads @xmath66 it can be rewritten alternatively as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 represents the unique solution to the equation @xmath70 since @xmath71 belongs to @xmath72 , using sobolev s embedding theorem we conclude that it has a bounded and continuous version , and therefore @xmath14 also has a representative which is bounded and continuous on the set @xmath73 .",
    "consider a discrete and finite subset @xmath74 and the positive constant @xmath65 defined above .",
    "as it is well known we can not regard the operator @xmath75 with the interaction supported by @xmath76 as before , i.e. as ` @xmath77 + measure ' .",
    "instead , we define this operator via its domain : each function @xmath78 behaves in the vicinity of a point @xmath79 as follows @xmath80 where the generalized boundary values @xmath81 and @xmath82 satisfy @xmath83 for any @xmath79 with @xmath84 ; for a justification of this definition and further properties of the operators @xmath75 see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii.4 ) .    the form ( [ bc ] ) which we have chosen",
    "is adapted for the indicated use of these operator in the approximation . in particular",
    ", the coupling parameter @xmath85 depends linearly on the cardinality of the set @xmath76 .",
    "however , it is important to stress that our problem differs substantially form its three - dimensional analogue considered in @xcite where no sign of @xmath65 played a preferred role . in",
    "the two - dimensional setting the coupling parameter tends to @xmath86 in the limit of weak and strong coupling , respectively .",
    "consequently , we will be able to find an approximation for operators ( [ formal ] ) with _ attractive interactions _ only .",
    "the krein s formula for the resolvent @xmath87 is the basic ingredient in the spectral analysis of the point - interaction hamiltonians .",
    "let @xmath61 and @xmath88 be the matrix @xmath89 given by @xmath90 \\delta_{xy } \\nonumber \\\\ & & - g_k(x - y)(1-\\delta_{xy})\\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the euler constant .",

    "one can see easily that the matrix @xmath88 is invertible for sufficiently large negative @xmath94 .",
    "indeed , the diagonal part is dominated by the term @xmath95 , while the non - diagonal elements vanish as @xmath96 , see the asymptotic formula @xcite for the hankel function @xmath97 . in view of our special choice of the coupling , an alternative way how to make the matrix @xmath98 invertible is to take a sufficiently large set @xmath76 .",

    "proof : _ let us first decompose the matrix @xmath113 into the diagonal and non - diagonal parts , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively . for @xmath116 being large enough",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath114 is invertible and its operator norm in @xmath117 converges to @xmath65 as @xmath118 . due to the strict inequality in the hypothesis there is an @xmath119 such that the inequality ( [ schur test ] ) holds with @xmath65 replaced by @xmath120 .",
    "then the schur - holmgren bound ( * ? ? ?",
    "c ) yields @xmath121 , which in turn implies that the matrix sum @xmath122 is invertible for a sufficiently large @xmath116 .    in analogy with the expression ( [ sing krein alt ] ) it is possible to rewrite krein s formula ( [ point krein ] ) in the form @xmath123 where @xmath124 solve the following system of equations , @xmath125 q_y - \\sum_{y ' \\in y , y'\\neq y } g_k ( y - y ' ) q_{y ' } = r_0^k \\psi \\ , ( y)\\,,\\ ] ] for all @xmath126 .",
    "with the above preliminaries we can proceed to the main goal  we will prove that for a chosen generalized schrdinger operator with an attractive interaction one can find an approximating sequence of point - potential schrdinger operators under requirements which will be specified below .",
    "the assumption about positions of the point potentials is obvious  loosely speaking , as the sites of potentials are getting denser in the set @xmath2 , they must copy the measure @xmath127 . then we have to specify the coupling - constant behaviour in the approximating operators . we have already mentioned that in the analogous situation in dimension three the coupling constants scale by @xcite linearly with the number @xmath128 of point potentials , and suggested the same behaviour here .",
    "this requires an explanation , because it is well known that the coupling constants are manifested differently in dimension three and two ; just consider a pair of point potentials and let their distance vary .    to get a hint that the scaling behavior for the approximation remains nevertheless the same , consider an infinite straight polymer as in (",

    "weaker_. this motivates the choice of the coupling constants in the form @xmath135 which we made in the boundary condition ( [ bc ] ) .",
