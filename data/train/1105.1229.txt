    "tensors are objects that appear in various contexts and applications .",

    "but in many problems , higher order tensors are naturally used to collect information which depend on more than two variables .",
    "typically , these data could be observations of some experimentation or of a physical phenomenon that depends on several parameters .",
    "these observations are stored in a structure called tensor , whose dimensional parameters ( or modes ) depend on the problem .",
    "the tensor decomposition problem consists of decomposing a tensor ( e.g. the set of observations ) into a minimal sum of so - called _ decomposable _ tensors ( i.e. tensors of rank @xmath0 ) .",
    "such a decomposition which is independent of the coordinate system allows to extract geometric or invariant properties associated with the observations . for this reason",

    "the first well known case is encountered for matrices ( i.e. tensors of order 2 ) , and is related to singular value decomposition with applications e.g. to principal component analysis .",
