    "the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) of cluster early - type galaxies has been extensively investigated at @xmath7 to trace their star formation history and hence to constrain their formation epoch ( e.g. e.g kodama & arimoto 1997 , hereafter ka97 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ; gladders et al . 1998 ; stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ; kodama & bower 2001 , hereafter kb01 ; smail et al .",
    "2001 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the most important observational results are : i ) the slope of the cmr does not depend on redshift ; ii ) the optical - nir rest - frame colors of early - type cluster members become bluer with increasing redshift ; iii ) the intrinsic scatter in the optical - nir colors of early - type galaxies is small at all redshifts ( e.g. ellis et al . 1997 ; stanford et al . 1998 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; kodama et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these points lead to explain the color - magnitude ( cm ) sequence as a correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity , while the age of galaxies play only a marginal role , if any ( e.g. ka97 ) .",
    "two different scenarios can successfully explain the cmr as function of redshift : the monolithic collapse ( e.g. eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage 1962 ; tinsley & gunn 1976 ) and the hierarchical merging ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 , kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "in the former , the trend of the mass - metallicity sequence is explained by the fact that the more massive galaxies retain supernova ejecta more effectively , resulting in higher metallicities and hence in redder colors for more luminous galaxies ( e.g. arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; ka97 ) .",
    "the unchanged scatter of the colors of early - type galaxies with redshift indicates either that the galaxies assembled synchronously over redshifts ( at least for @xmath6 ) or that they stochastically formed at much earlier times ( see ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) . for what concerns",
    "the alternative picture , kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) claimed that the cmr can be reproduced in a hierarchical merging picture , where the more massive / metal - rich ellipticals result from mergers of massive / metal - rich progenitor disk galaxies . in both scenarios",
    "the color evolution of early - type cluster galaxies is in agreement with the passive evolution of an old stellar population formed early in the past ( see also stanford et al . 1998 ; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "both the main evolutionary scenarios have to face with the evidence for the presence of a significant population of blue galaxies in rich cluster environments at @xmath8 0.2 , as shown for the first time by butcher & oelmer ( 1978 ) and has confirmed by several photometric and spectroscopic observations ( e.g. butcher & oelmer 1984 ; couch & newell 1984 ; ellis et al .",

    "taking into account a representative sample of the whole cluster population , kb01 re - investigated the photometric butcher - oelmer ( b - o ) effect in distant clusters .",
    "they found that the passive evolution of galaxy populations can reconcile the b - o effect with the tight cmr of the coma cluster .",
    "furthermore , kb01 found that the distribution in the color - magnitude diagrams suggests a scenario where star formation of galaxies accreted by the cluster declines on a 1 gyr time - scale and it is not sharply truncated by interaction with the cluster environment .",
    "in this scenario , the b - o effect depends on the decline of star formation of field galaxies when they are accreted into the cluster and on the decline of the rate of accretion of new galaxies at lower redshifts .    in the present work we will apply the cm diagram to gain insight into the star formation history in the galaxy cluster ac118 at @xmath0 .",
    "we will use population synthesis models in order to describe the observed cm distribution of galaxies in ac118 in terms of stellar populations parameters .",
    "the cluster sample is selected according to the photometric redshift technique , and is complete in k - band , avoiding biases introduced by measuring the blue wavelengths in the cluster rest - frame .",
    "the early - type galaxy population in the core of ac118 was already analyzed by stanford et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found evidence in favor of the passive evolution scenario .",
    "a spectroscopic study of the cluster was performed by couch & sharples ( 1987 ) and barger et al .",

    "the layout of the paper is the following . in ",
    "2 we describe the sample of galaxies at @xmath10 . in ",
    "3 we introduce the galaxy templates that will be used to interpret the observed photometry in terms of physical properties of stellar populations and we describe our approach .",
    "the resulting distribution of the physical parameters is analyzed in   4 , where we also discuss the origins of the cmr and the global star formation history . in   5 we summarize the main aspects of the work and draw the conclusions .",
    "in the following we assume @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . with this cosmology the age of the universe is @xmath14 , and the redshift of ac118 corresponds to a look - back time of @xmath15 .",
    "we verified that changing the cosmology does not affect the results of the present work .",
    "the present analysis is based on vrik photometry for a sample of galaxies in a field of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 at @xmath0 ) centered on the galaxy cluster ac118 .",
    "the optical ( vri ) data are taken from the catalog in busarello et al . (",
    "2002 ) , which also includes photometric redshifts , while the k - band photometry is described in andreon ( 2001 ) .",
    "the present sample was selected according to the following criteria : a ) galaxies are cluster members according to their photometric redshifts and b ) the sample is complete in the k - band . in figure  [ selzp ]",
    "we compare the distribution of the k - band magnitudes for the 459 member galaxies from busarello et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with the k - band luminosity function of ac118 by andreon ( 2001 ) , obtained by statistically subtracting field counts .",
    "the figure shows that the trend of our counts and the luminosity function of ac118 are consistent down to @xmath19 , suggesting , therefore , that the sample of member galaxies is fairly complete down to this limit .",
    "this leads to a final sample of @xmath20 galaxies brighter than @xmath19 . in order to quantify the field contamination in the redshift range adopted to select cluster members ( i.e. @xmath21 $ ] )",
    ", we note that the field population at @xmath16 is dominated by late - type galaxies bluer than @xmath22 , and therefore , the field contaminants in our sample are expected to be brighter than @xmath23 . according to the canada france redshift survey ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) , we expect @xmath24 galaxies down to @xmath25 in the cluster area and redshift range , amounting to @xmath26 of the galaxies in the final sample .",
    "since this estimate is an upper limit of the number of field contaminants , we conclude that foreground / background contamination is not statistically relevant to the present analysis .    the color indices were measured within a fixed circular aperture of diameter @xmath27 ( @xmath28 at @xmath0 ) . in the following , we will also use the @xmath29 colors derived by bower , lucey , & ellis ( 1992a ) for galaxies in the coma cluster within an aperture of @xmath30 , which corresponds to @xmath31 kpc .",
    "since galaxies are known to have internal color gradients , a suitable comparison between different redshifts must take into account the physical size of the aperture within which galaxy colors are derived .",
    "however , as shown by kodama et al .",
    "1998 ( see their figure  3 ) , the correction from the @xmath32 aperture to the @xmath33 aperture turns out to be negligible for the coma galaxies .    in order to estimate the total magnitude",
    ", we used adaptive apertures of radius @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the kron radius ( see kron 1980 ) .",
    "we chose @xmath36 , for which the kron magnitude is expected to enclose @xmath37 of the total flux of the object ( see bertin @xmath38 arnouts 1996 ) , and to correct for this factor , we added to the kron magnitudes the term @xmath39 . since the bright cluster galaxies have extended halos . ] , the estimate of the total magnitude requires a large extrapolation of the light profile . to account for this fact ,",
    "it is necessary to correct the kron magnitudes @xmath40 of the brightest galaxies . to this aim , we compared the @xmath40 values with those derived by the two - dimensional fit of the surface brightness distribution for the subsample of @xmath41 galaxies analyzed in la barbera et al .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure  [ kckt ] as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "we found that the kron magnitude underestimates the galaxy luminosity for values of @xmath40 brighter than @xmath42 .",
    "the trend in figure  [ kckt ] is described by the relation @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , that was used to correct the values of @xmath40 for each galaxy in our sample .    in figure  [ cmcctot ]",
    "we show the cm distributions of 1 ) all the galaxies in the k - band field , 2 ) the galaxies with available photometric redshift and 3 ) the @xmath20 galaxies of the sample considered in the analysis .",
    "our goal is to fit the colors and magnitudes of galaxies in ac118 by imposing that their evolution at @xmath1 reproduces the properties of the cm diagram of a nearby galaxy cluster . to this aim ,",
    "we use stellar population models at different evolutionary stages .",
    "since ac118 is a rich , coma - like , cluster with high x - ray luminosity , the properties of its galaxy population have to be compared with those of galaxies in a rich cluster at @xmath1 .",
    "the sample of galaxies at @xmath16 covers the central cluster region ( @xmath17 ) , which corresponds to an area of radius @xmath45 . in this region ,",
    "rich nearby clusters are very similar in their photometric properties .",
    "the galaxy population is dominated by early - type galaxies which follow a tight cm relation ( see bower et al . 1992a , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992b ) , with few percents of galaxies having bluer colors ( see butcher & oemler 1978 ) .",
    "therefore , we can constrain the properties of the galaxies using only the overall features of the cm diagrams at @xmath1 , without comparing the properties of ac118 galaxies with those of a specific nearby cluster .",
    "we describe the stellar populations in terms of their formation epoch @xmath46 , time scale @xmath47 of star formation and metallicity @xmath48 .",
    "we do not assume any _ a priori _ probability distribution of @xmath49 , but instead we derive it by comparison of a set of model ( template ) galaxies with the observed cm distributions .",
    "the galaxy templates were obtained by the gissel98 synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "each template is defined by the three physical parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the code allows to build galaxy templates with metallicity in the range @xmath500.0001  0.1 . ] and predicts the template properties at 220 steps in age ranging from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the star formation rate is chosen in the form @xmath53 , with @xmath47 in the range 0.01  15.0 gyr , with a scalo ( 1986 ) initial mass function .",
    "for each value of @xmath54 in the grid of input parameters , we computed the magnitudes in the v- , r- , i- and k - band . for all other values of @xmath54 ,",
    "the magnitudes were derived by interpolation .",
    "since the magnitudes of the gissel98 templates are arbitrarily normalized to one solar mass , they are defined within an additive term , and therefore they can not be directly compared to the observed magnitudes .",
    "we derived the additive term by using the properties of the cm distribution at @xmath55 . to this aim , for each template we computed the @xmath29 color at @xmath1 and compared the template magnitude in the k - band with that expected for a galaxy in a rich nearby cluster with the same @xmath29 color .",

    "in fact , our unique constraint is that each template is bounded by the same region of galaxies in the cm diagram at @xmath1 .",
    "this point will be further discussed in section  [ fine ] .    to account for measurement errors",
    ", the fitting procedures were iterated by shifting colors and magnitudes of galaxies in ac118 according to their photometric uncertainties . in this way , for each iteration we obtained a distribution of ` best ' parameters @xmath80 which describes the photometric properties of all the @xmath20 galaxies in our sample at @xmath10 .",

    "studies of the cm relation based on pure morphological selection can be biased towards the older progenitors of nearby early - type galaxies ( see van dokkum et al . 2000 for a detailed discussion ) . on the other side",
    ", the application of a statistical field subtraction approach requires a wide area around the cluster field to be observed , while the use of a spectroscopically selected sample at faint luminosities is very expensive in terms of observing time ( but not impossible , see abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "the main advantage of a selection based on photometric redshifts is that it allows to estimate the typical luminosity - weighted formation epoch of a stellar population irrespective of the past history of the host galaxy ( such as , for example , clustering through a merging hierarchy ) , and it is therefore an ideal tool to define cluster membership for large samples of galaxies without any tie to a particular scenario of galaxy formation .",
    "a more tricky point is represented by the areas of the clusters to be compared at different redshifts . in a hierarchical clustering picture ,",

    "for such reasons , we have analyzed the constraints on the properties of the stellar populations of the galaxies in ac118 by imposing that their evolution at @xmath132 mimics the overall distribution in the ( @xmath56 ) plane for a local rich cluster .    with the aim of constraining the galaxy evolution scenarios ,",
    "several studies have adopted a purely parametric approach , by comparing the observed properties in the cm diagram with those predicted by models that are based on different sets of parameters and that explore different assumptions on the probability distributions of such parameters .",
    "these studies also assume that the scatter in the cm diagram arises merely from age ( but see ferreras , charlot , & silk 1999 ) .",
    "although the first epoch of star formation for the cluster early - type population seems to be constrained to high redshifts for almost all such models , further properties , as the last epoch and the spread of star formation activity , are more model dependent .",
    "the procedure we adopted describes each galaxy of ac118 by a stellar population model , which is constrained , when evolved to @xmath1 , to be bounded by the red sequence locus or by the region of blue galaxies of a rich nearby cluster ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "this is achieved by a suitable procedure which scales the magnitudes of the galaxy templates .",
    "we find that the best fitting models of ac118 galaxies are able to match both the distributions in the ( @xmath83 ) and ( @xmath82,@xmath133 ) planes at @xmath16 , and the properties of the ( @xmath56 ) color - magnitude distribution at @xmath132 , i.e. slope and intrinsic scatter of the cm sequence , fraction of blue galaxies and luminosity function .",
    "it is important to notice that such a result is not implicit in the method we used to scale the template magnitudes ( see section  [ fitmod ] ) .",
    "the constraint at @xmath132 largely reduces the region of input parameters available to the model . in particular",
    ", a sharp sequence arises in the metallicity - luminosity diagram ( cfr .",
    "lower left panels of figures  [ cplot1 ] and  [ cplot2 ] ) , for which brighter galaxies are described by higher values of @xmath48 .",
    "the slope of the sequence is in full agreement with that derived by ka97 in the framework of the monolithic collapse / galactic wind model .",
    "it is interesting to notice that if we adopt the luminosity  weighted mean stellar metallicity of the ka97 models , the zero - points of the relations also coincide .",
    "the main difference between the results of ka97 and those of the present work is that we do not obtain the metallicity sequence on the basis of a particular galaxy evolution scenario .",
    "the present data seem to exclude significant variations of star formation history along the cmr , and therefore confirm a pure metallicity interpretation , in which the bulk of the populations formed at high redshift ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "these results , however , do not describe the properties of all the stellar populations in ac118 : we find that about @xmath94 of the points of our model do not follow any metallicity ",
    "luminosity relation , but are characterized by higher values of z and more prolonged star formation activity ( @xmath135 ) . since these objects do not show peculiar photometric properties in the colors - magnitude space , this result could be the consequence of a residual age  metallicity degeneracy .",
    "however , other possibilities can be explored .",
    "for instance , the scatter of the cm relation at a given luminosity could be partly due to the fact that more recently assembled galaxies have higher metallicity than older systems of similar luminosity ( see ferreras et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to study the dispersion in the cm diagram at @xmath16 , we computed the epoch @xmath115 at which galaxies completed to form @xmath106 of their stars .",
    "while for @xmath136 the corresponding redshift is greater than @xmath105 , at faintest magnitudes ( @xmath137 ) we find that some galaxies ceased to form stars at epochs as low as @xmath121 .",
    "these results are in agreement with the general picture that fainter galaxies were more recently accreted from the field to the cluster environment and therefore ceased to form stars at later epochs ( see kb01 for a wide discussion ) .    one half of the luminous mass present at @xmath16 formed at @xmath125 , and star formation continued at @xmath6 for @xmath138 of the stars .",
    "this result changes if we are neglecting the effect of the dust obscuration in a significant fraction of cluster galaxies . to investigate this subject",
    ", we adopted a simple model in which all the galaxies redder than the cm envelope at @xmath16 are obscured by a uniform screen of dust .",
    "the introduction of this model is also supported by the presence of few galaxies of ac118 whose r - k color is too red with respect to the cmr .",
    "these objects may be accounted for as dusty galaxies with extensive on - going star formation activity ( cfr .",
    "kb01 ) . in the model with dust ,",
    "the fraction of mass that forms at @xmath6 increases from @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
