    "one encounters non - linear differential equations everywhere in theoretical physics .",
    "string theory is no exception , as a matter of course . for example , when a string is moving on a curved space , the classical equation of motion becomes non - linear generally .",
    "if the curved background has a special coset - structure like ads@xmath1s@xmath2 , the string theory is classically integrable in the sense that the lax pair exists @xcite .",
    "then classical solutions can be studied analytically , for example , by using the classical inverse scattering method . however , in most cases , one can not solve analytically non - linear differential equations .",
    "the systems are non - integrable and exhibit chaos .",
    "recently , chaotic string solutions have been well studied in various ways @xcite .",
    "motivation lies on potential applications to the ads / cft correspondence @xcite beyond integrability @xcite , but it has not been clarified yet what corresponds to chaotic strings in the gauge - theory side . note that chaotic motions can not be described with analytic functions .",
    "this is a characteristic of chaos .",
    "so it may be intriguing to ask whether the correspondence holds even in the non - analytic region or not .",
    "one can test it at a deeper level .    along this direction ,",
    "one may focus upon the m - theory dynamics .",
    "a matrix model description of light - front m - theory is proposed by banks - fischler - shenker - susskind @xcite .",
    "it is called the bfss matrix model . chaos in this model",
    "was studied in @xcite by following the way in classical yang - mills ( ym ) theories @xcite . however , there are some unsatisfactory points . in the bfss matrix model ,",
    "there are flat directions which may cause unbounded motions .",
    "then the motions may conflict with the boundedness of chaos during long - time numerical computation of classical trajectories .",
    "another point is a technical problem . in @xcite ,",
    "the largest lyapunov exponents were computed by reducing the system to simple models .",
    "however , it does not seem that the results converge on definite values .",
    "in addition , the time scale of ( would - be ) convergence is also much larger than the inverse of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "thus , it would be worth revisiting chaotic motions in the bfss matrix model .",
    "a more appropriate system is the berenstein - maldacena - nastase ( bmn ) matrix model @xcite .",
    "it contains mass terms and flat directions are lifted up .",
    "hence there is no subtlety with the boundedness of chaos .",
    "in addition , the myers term may give rise to a separatrix structure in the phase space .",
    "it means a bifurcation of the behavior of classical solutions and may be a source of chaos . in total , the bmn matrix model is a good laboratory to study chaotic motions .    in this paper",
    ", we will study classical chaos in the bmn matrix model .",
    "for this purpose , it is useful to reduce the full system to a simple model composed of two - coupled anharmonic oscillators by supposing an ansatz .",
    "we examine three cases : 1 ) two pulsating fuzzy spheres , 2 ) a single coulomb - type potential , and 3 ) integrable fuzzy spheres . for the first two cases ,",
    "we show the existence of chaos by computing poincar sections and a lyapunov spectrum .",
    "the third case leads to an integrable system . as a result ,",
    "the bmn matrix model is not integrable in the sense of liouville , though there may be some integrable subsectors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a brief review of chaos .",
    "in particular , the characteristics of chaos in the hamiltonian system .",
    "section 3 considers the hnon - heiles system as an example of non - integrable hamiltonian systems . in section 4",
    "we consider chaotic motions and an integrable subsector in the bmn matrix model .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusion and discussion . in appendix",
    "a , the computation scheme of lyapunov spectrum is summarized .",
    "probably , anybody has said the term , `` chaos '' .",
    "for example , when you see the top of the desk in a mess , you would say `` it s chaos '' .",
    "so it seems likely that `` chaos '' implies that some things are completely messed up .",
    "in fact , this point captures an aspect of chaos , _",
    "randomness_.    there would be no universally accepted definition of chaos .",
    "the following is a list of characteristics of chaos commonly seen in almost any books :    1 .",
    "high sensitivity to initial conditions , 2 .",
    "randomness of motions ( continuous spectrum ) , 3 .",
    "non - periodic and bounded motions ( non - analyticity ) .",
    "the item 1 ) is significant and it is sometimes called _ the butterfly effect_. one may know the following famous sentence , `` does the flap of a butterfly s wings in brazil set off a tornado in texas ? '' here the flapping wing corresponds to a small change of the initial condition and it may cause a chain of events leading to large scale phenomena .",
    "suppose a continuous dynamical system described by a set of non - linear differential equations .",
    "the system is deterministic because the dynamics is determined by fixing an initial condition .",
    "but one can not predict the motions generally after long time has passed because of the non - linearity .",
    "that is , it is impossible to forecast weather in the far future .",
    "this indicates that some information is lost dynamically and it is measured by the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy .",
    "this entropy production is concerned with the randomness [ the item 2 ) ] .    the item 3 )",
    "can be intuitively understood .",
    "if the motion is periodic , then it does not satisfy the other properties .",
    "it exhibits the line spectrum and no sharp sensitivity to initial conditions . to see that the boundedness is necessary ,",
    "let us consider a simple system @xmath3 .",
    "the orbits run away exponentially to infinity , hence it seems to exhibit high sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "however , it just means an attracting fixed - point at infinity and does not indicate chaotic motions . the recurrence of motions should be required implicitly so as to exclude fixed points .",
    "non - analyticity follows from the continuous spectrum .",
    "the smooth behavior in the fourier space indicates a random , non - analytic motion in the real space ( i.e. , the motion is continuous but not differentiable everywhere ) .",
    "hence chaotic motions do not behave in an analytic way in comparison to ( quasi-)periodic ones .",
    "indeed , if the motion is described by an analytic function , then one can predict the motion for an arbitrarily long time and it does not satisfy the item 1 ) .",
    "there are three methods to see chaos , 1 ) poincar sections , 2 ) lyapunov spectrum and 3 ) power spectrum .",
    "since some readers are not familiar to these issues , it would be helpful to introduce each of them below .      to study complex trajectories in the phase space , it is helpful to use a poincar section , which is a surface of section intersecting the flow in the phase space",
    ". it is defined so that all of the possible orbits cross the section repeatedly .",
    "the dimension of the flow ( i.e. , the dynamical system ) is the number of the first - order ordinary differential equations , and the dimension of poincar sections is one lower than it . on a poincar section",
    ", an orbit is mapped to dots , which are the intersection points of the orbit and the poincar section .",
    "since the dynamics is governed by a set of differential equations , the original trajectory can be reconstructed from the dots on the poincar section . in this sense ,",
    "the flow and the poincar section are equivalent , while there is a degree of freedom to choose the surface in practice .",
    "it is the usual to pick up only the dots at which the trajectory intersects from only the one side to the other side .",
    "this constraint allows any dots on a poincar section to uniquely determine the next point of the trajectory in autonomous hamiltonian systems .",
    "suppose a hamiltonian system with a four - dimensional phase space @xmath4 .",
    "a poincar section is a two - dimensional surface , for example , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    by changing initial values , a set of trajectories",
    "is generated and it contains several kinds of motions . the poincar section is helpful to figure out their behaviors .",
    "periodic orbits are projected onto the poincar section as finite numbers of dots on closed contours .",
    "a periodic trajectory comes back to a point on the poincar section after its period .",
    "quasi - periodic orbits are also projected as dots on closed contours , but the resulting portrait becomes dense .",
    "they are understood as non - resonant tori .",
    "completely chaotic orbits result in randomly scattered dots on the poincar section .",
    "these behaviors depend on initial values and generally chaotic motions coexist with ( quasi-)periodic motions on the section .",
    "suppose that a small perturbation makes an integrable system be non - integrable .",
    "then the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory @xcite claims that trajectories incline to be chaotic gradually as the perturbation becomes larger . when the perturbation is small enough , most of the orbits are ( quasi-)periodic .",
    "these are called kam tori , which are the remnants of liouville tori in the unperturbed integrable system . in other words ,",
    "almost all of the liouville tori survive the small perturbation , though the tori are distorted and translated . as the perturbation becomes larger",
    ", chaotic trajectories appear and coexist with kam tori .",
    "then the region of chaotic trajectories enlarges while the kam tori tend to get broken .",
    "when the perturbation is larger , kam islands and islets are in the sea of chaos .",
    "the next is to introduce the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "it is very useful to measure the dynamical information loss .",
    "let us first introduce a lyapunov exponent .",
    "we basically follow the description in @xcite .",
    "suppose that a solution @xmath7 is chaotic and consider a nearby point @xmath8 .",
    "then the deviation @xmath9 grows exponentially like @xmath10 is a positive constant called a lyapunov exponent .",
    "this behavior indicates that the deviation of the initial value @xmath11 is amplified exponentially even if it is very tiny .",
    "this is nothing but a realization of sensitive dependence on initial conditions .    in general",
    ", the phase space is higher - dimensional .",
    "then there are @xmath12 different lyapunov exponents for an @xmath12-dimensional phase space .",
    "an intuitive explanation is the following .",
    "consider time evolution of an infinitesimal sphere of perturbed initial configurations . during its evolution",
    ", the sphere tends to be distorted into an infinitesimal ellipsoid .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the length of the @xmath14-th principal axis of the ellipsoid .",
    "then the deviations behave as @xmath15 the set of the exponents @xmath16 generates a spectrum called the lyapunov spectrum . for large @xmath17 , the diameter of the ellipsoid is controlled by the most positive @xmath16 , and it is called the largest lyapunov exponent .    the lyapunov spectrum is also related to the dynamical entropy production .",
    "for example , the sum of all of the positive lyapunov exponents is identified with the ks entropy when the system is ergodic .",
    "it would be very interesting to look for an application of the ks entropy in the context of string theory and m - theory .",
    "the power spectrum is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a two time correlation function .",
    "it is quite helpful when one needs to distinguish quasi - periodic motions and chaotic motions .",
    "when the ratio of periods is irrational , the former leads to dense orbits in the phase space ( the denseness ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the latter is related to a stochastic motion ( the randomness ) . in the hamiltonian system , there is no attractor because the phase space volume has to be preserved due to liouville s theorem .",
    "hence it is often difficult to distinguish them at a first glance .",
    "however , the power spectrum shows clear distinction . for quasi - periodic motions ,",
    "the spectrum contains sharp peaks associated with periods ( the line spectrum ) . on the other hand",
    ", the continuous spectrum appears for chaotic motions .    in the following",
    ", we will focus upon the first two methods , poincar sections and a lyapunov spectrum .",
    "in this section , let us consider the hnon - heiles system @xcite .",
    "this is a famous example of non - integrable hamiltonian systems containing chaotic motions .",
    "this model was originally proposed by hnon and heiles ( 1964 ) in the study of celestial mechanics .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary real constant parameter .",
    "the system is composed of two particles with the same mass ( normalized to 1 ) and the interaction is third - order .",
    "the positions of the particles are described by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the conjugate momenta are @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it is well - known that this system is non - integrable .    before going to the detailed analysis",
    ", it may be interesting to see that the form of the interaction term in ( [ hh ] ) is very important .",
    "if the interaction term is slightly modified like @xmath26 then the system becomes classically integrable .",
    "the resulting system is often called `` anti hnon - heiles system '' .",
    "the system with ( [ hh ] ) is equivalent to a periodic lattice with three particles , @xmath27\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "h_0 & = & \\frac{1}{2}(p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 )   + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[(q_1-q_2)^2 + ( q_2-q_3)^2 + ( q_3-q_1)^2\\right]\\ , . \\label{three } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath28 describes a system of three connected harmonic oscillators .",
    "hence the equations of motion for @xmath28 are exactly solved by using the normal coordinates . by using the normal coordinate for @xmath28",
    ", one can rewrite the total hamiltonian @xmath29 . then , after dropping the total momentum , the hnon - heiles system is reproduced .    here",
    "one may sum up higher - order interaction terms with appropriate numerical coefficients and obtain an exponential - type potential .",
    "the resulting system is nothing but a toda lattice system @xcite .",
    "hence , inversely speaking , the hnon - heiles system may be regarded as a truncation of the toda lattice system .",
    "let us see chaotic motions in the hnon - heiles system ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "it is a good exercise to understand chaotic motions in the hamiltonian system . here",
    "we will consider poincar sections and a lyapunov spectrum .",
    "these quantities can be evaluated numerically and the results are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      let us concentrate on the @xmath31 subsector and consider the following ansatz : @xmath32 here @xmath33 are the standard pauli matrices and hence the matrix size of @xmath34 is @xmath35",
    ". then @xmath36 and @xmath37 are real functions to be determined .",
    "the ansatz ( [ ansatz3 ] ) satisfies the gauss law constraint ( [ gauss ] ) . with the ansatz ( [ ansatz3 ] ) , the equations of motion ( [ eom ] )",
    "are boiled down to @xmath38 one can derive this system ( [ s3 ] ) from the following lagrangian : @xmath39    note that the system ( [ s3 ] ) is completely integrable .",
    "this means that there exists the second integral of motion as well as the hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the integrability of this system was shown in @xcite . in order to show the integrability , it is helpful to shift @xmath40 as @xmath41",
    ". then the resulting lagrangian is @xmath42 where the constant term has been dropped off .",
    "now it is easy to compare the expression ( [ ex ] ) with the results in @xcite , and the second integral is given by @xmath43\\ , .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it may be interesting to rewrite the hamiltonian @xmath29 by subtracting @xmath44 . one can easily show the following expression : @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the conjugate momentum for @xmath48 . thus the hamiltonian @xmath49 is nothing but a system of two independent oscillators .",
    "finally , it should be remarked that the following orthogonal transformation makes the integrability apparent : @xmath50 it recasts @xmath34 into the block - diagonal form that indicates that the system is composed of two independent pulsating fuzzy spheres with the radial coordinates @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "although this ansatz seems rather trivial , it would be worth to mention that the bmn matrix model contains an integrable subsystem .",
    "in this paper , we have studied classical chaotic motions in the bmn matrix model .",
    "we have examined three anstze : 1 ) two pulsating fuzzy spheres , 2 ) a single coulomb - type potential , and 3 ) two coupled fuzzy spheres . for the first two cases ,",
    "we have shown the existence of chaos by computing poincar sections and a lyapunov spectrum .",
    "the third case has led to an integrable system . as a result",
    ", the bmn matrix model is not integrable in the sense of liouville , though there may be some integrable subsectors",
    ".    it would be worth to comment on preceding works on the integrability of the bmn matrix model @xcite .",
    "the integrability argument is based on the fact that the bmn matrix model is obtained as a consistent kaluza - klein ( kk ) reduction of the @xmath53=4 super yang - mills ( sym ) theory on @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the dilatation operator of the @xmath53=4 sym on @xmath55 is identified with the hamiltonian of the @xmath53=4 sym on @xmath54 via the operator - state mapping .",
    "it is now realized that the dilatation operator is closely connected with an integrable spin chain hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "hence the integrability of the dilatation operator might be inherited to the bmn matrix model through the kk - reduction .",
    "note here that we have considered classical chaos in the bmn matrix model , which is concerned with the classical hamiltonian of the @xmath53=4 sym on @xmath54 ( or the classical dilatation operator @xmath56 of the @xmath53=4 sym on @xmath55 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin - chain description is realized at the quantum level and the quantum dilatation operator @xmath57 plays a central role is divided as follows : @xmath58 the first term @xmath59 is concerned with the free hamiltonian of the bmn matrix model , in which there is no chaotic motion as a matter of course . ] .",
    "thus our analysis has indirect relevance with the preceding one",
    ". it may be interesting to study whether the classical chaos can survive the quantization .",
    "the bmn matrix model was originally proposed in the context of m - theory and it can be regarded as a deformation of the m(atrix ) theory @xcite .",
    "it would be very intriguing to try to understand the chaotic motions from the point of view of the d0-brane dynamics . with some generalizations ,",
    "those may capture an aspect of black hole physics such as the fast scrambling process @xcite .",
    "for interesting works along this direction , see @xcite . in the very recent ,",
    "a bound on a lyapunov exponent has been argued @xcite .",
    "it seems promising that non - linear dynamical perspectives of string theory and m - theory would be more and more important .",
    "the way and result presented here would be a key ingredient in tackling the fundamental problems like information loss due to a black hole formation .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge helpful discussions with sinya aoki , masanori hanada , takeshi matsumoto and shin - ichi sasa .",
    "the work of ya was supported by the japan society for the promotion of science ( jsps ) .",
    "this work is supported in part by the jsps japan - hungary research cooperative program .",
    "a part of the numerical calculations were carried out on sr16000 at yitp in kyoto university .",
    "in section 2 , we have explained the notion of the lyapunov spectrum in an intuitive way .",
    "more practically , in order to numerically evaluate the lyapunov spectrum , we have to follow a mathematical formulation .",
    "the basic method is based on the expansion rate of the volume @xcite . with this method ,",
    "all of the @xmath12 lyapunov exponents can be computed .",
    "consider a system of the first differential equations described by @xmath60 then , by taking a variation , the following relation is obtained , @xmath61 hence a deviation vector @xmath62 can be expressed as @xmath63 here @xmath64 is a time evolution operator and @xmath65 is the initial value of the deviation vector .",
    "this is a solution of ( [ eq : dev.dif.eq ] ) .",
    "the linearity of @xmath64 leads to the following relation : @xmath66 then the lyapunov exponent for this deviation vector is defined as @xmath67 here in the last expression @xmath68 is divided into @xmath69 small steps like @xmath70 .",
    "the convergence of this limit is proven by oseledec @xcite .",
    "let us next introduce a fancy trick to compute the lyapunov spectrum composed of @xmath12 exponents .",
    "the first is to prepare an orthonormal basis set @xmath71 to span the tangent vector space along the trajectory .",
    "then we make each basis @xmath72 evolve by @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting set of the vectors @xmath74 cease to be one of the orthonormal vectors , where @xmath75 .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fig : time.evolve ] .",
    "then it is necessary to rebuild a new set of the orthogonal vectors @xmath76 from @xmath77 by following the gram - schmidt process and compute the expansion rate @xmath78 for each vector @xmath79  : @xmath80",
    "lastly , the orthogonal vector set @xmath81 is normalized as @xmath82 thus a single cycle has been completed .",
    "then the same cycle should be repeated @xmath69 times .",
    "this means that the set @xmath83 is used as an initial orthonormal vector set for the @xmath84-th cycle .",
    "now the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath85 is defined as @xmath86 by construction , @xmath87 heads toward the direction which has the highest sensitivity to initial conditions at sufficiently late time .",
    "thus the expansion rate @xmath88 has the largest value in this region .",
    "then it is obvious from ( [ eq : lyapunov.def.multi ] ) that the largest lyapunov exponent is given by the sum of logarithm of the expansion rate .    in a similar way",
    ", the @xmath14-th lyapunov exponent @xmath16 is defined as @xmath89 thus the set of the exponents @xmath90 is obtained .",
    "this set is called the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "note that the computation time can be estimated by the inverse of the smallest positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "this is because all of the exponents converge within this scale .",
    "a characteristic of the lyapunov spectrum in the hamiltonian system is that the total sum of the exponents becomes zero , i.e. , @xmath91 this relation follows from the computation scheme of the lyapunov spectrum . by construction ,",
    "each of the exponent measures the expansion rate of the orthogonal basis in the phase space .",
    "hence the volume @xmath92 spanned by the bases is expressed as @xmath93 liouville s theorem says that the phase - space volume is conserved in the hamiltonian system ( i.e. , @xmath94 ) .",
    "thus the relation ( [ eq : lyap.consv ] ) must be satisfied .",
