    "within such a scheme , hawking emission is only important in a certain frequency range @xcite , but nothing can be said about the end - state of black hole evaporation .    an outstanding open problem is whether one can derive a time - dependent spherically symmetric background metric which incorporates the effects of non - commutative geometry .",
