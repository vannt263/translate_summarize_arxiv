    "the special properties of the chosen elliptic fibration allow us to find a configuration in the result of the knot surgery such that after rationally blowing it down we arrive to a 4manifold homeomorphic , but not diffeomorphic to @xmath0 . by using a suitable infinite set of knots ( the twist knots already encountered in @xcite , cf .",

    "we will consider fibrations containing only singular fibers of type @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "recall that the singular fiber @xmath11 ( also known as the _ fishtail _ fiber ) is an immersed 2sphere with one positive double point , and it is created from a regular torus fiber by collapsing a homologically essential simple closed curve ( the _ vanishing cycle _ of the singular fiber ) .",

    "the only subtlety we have to keep in mind is that here we allow a singular fiber to contain more than one singular points as well .",
    "lefschetz fibrations can be conveniently described by the monodromy factorization induced by the singular fibers of the fibration , that is , by a word involving right",
    " handed dehn twists which is equal to 1 in the mapping class group of the regular fiber .",

    "for example , the standard elliptic fibration we get by blowing up nine base points of a generic elliptic pencil in @xmath25 results the monodromy factorization @xmath26 . using the braid relation @xmath27",
    "it can be shown that @xmath28 also defines an elliptic fibration on @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see that for any expression @xmath29 the mapping class @xmath30 can be identified with the right  handed dehn twist along the image of @xmath21 under a map giving @xmath31 .",
    "note , for example , that the braid relation implies that @xmath32 .",
    "the monodromy of a fishtail fiber can be shown to be equal to the right  handed dehn twist along the vanishing cycle corresponding to the given singular fiber .",
    "an @xmath9fiber can be created by collapsing @xmath13 parallel ( homologically essential ) simple closed curves , therefore the monodromy of such a fiber is equal to the @xmath33 power of the right  handed dehn twist along one of the parallel curves .    in our constructions",
    "we will need the existence of a section , which can also be read off from the monodromy factorization . in general , a lefschetz fibration admits a section if the monodromy factorization induced by it can be lifted from the mapping class group of its generic fiber to the mapping class group of the fiber with one marked point . in the case of a genus1 lefschetz fibration , however , the forgetful map @xmath34 mapping from the mapping class group @xmath35 of @xmath16 with one marked point to @xmath36 is an isomorphism , implying in particular    [ l : szeles ] any genus1 lefschetz fibration over @xmath37 admits a section .      our first construction of exotic 4manifolds relies on the following existence result .",
