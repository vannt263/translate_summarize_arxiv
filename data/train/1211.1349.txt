    "unfortunately without this assumption on @xmath25 , there is no such simple way to determine whether ergodicity occurs or not .",
    "however we can make a naive remark : since @xmath78 is the statistic speed of peaks and @xmath79 is the one of holes , basic intuition says that increasing @xmath78 should make the shape more irregular , making the process @xmath37 more likely to be transient .",
    "conversely , increasing @xmath79 should make the shape smoother , making the process @xmath37 more likely to be recurrent .",
    "+ gates and westcott later proved several results about the problem of recurrence in shape for other parameters , by means of foster criteria with quite simple lyapunov functions .",
    "theorem 2 in @xcite states that for periodic conditions and @xmath2 , @xmath37 is transient if @xmath80 .",
    "ergodicity is shown to hold for @xmath81 and a similar condition for ergodicity is also obtained for a process with a two - dimensional grid of sites .",

    "moreover there exists @xmath86 such that @xmath87    we point out that this result is actually given for @xmath88 but the reader may verify that its proof works exactly the same if we take @xmath89",
    ". we will pick up several ideas of the approach in @xcite in order to give weaker conditions for ergodicity in shape .",
    "our notations will be consistent with this reference as much as possible . before stating our results we begin by defining two useful notions : growth rate and monotonicity .",
    "suppose that @xmath37 is ergodic and let @xmath90 be its invariant distribution .",
    "there exists @xmath91 such that for @xmath33 , almost surely , @xmath92 moreover , for any @xmath33 , we have @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 . since @xmath95 is a counting process with intensity @xmath96 , we have that @xmath97 and also    @xmath98    since ergodicity yields the a.s .",
