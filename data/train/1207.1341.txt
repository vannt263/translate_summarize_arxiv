    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , as the invisible matter interacting by the force of gravity , has been widely accepted by cosmological observations from the experiments : cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , galactic rotation curves @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite and massive compact halo objects @xcite , and @xmath1 . about 83% of the matter ( around 23% of the total energy density ) in the universe is believed to be composed of dm to account for the observations . however , the nature of dm is still completely unknown despite decades of detection efforts .",
    "many possible explanations have been proposed .",
    "one of the alternative explanations from the point of view of particle physics is that dm is composed of massive particles and its interaction with ordinary matter is very weak .",
    "recently several dm models ( inelastic dm @xcite , asymmetric dm @xcite , form factor dm @xcite ) with magnetic dipole interaction have been considered .",
    "dm in these models has a few states and has no direct interaction with the photon .",
    "the candidate particles could thus be stable and make up the invisible matter in our universe .",
    "on the other hand , the direct interaction with photon through magnetic dipole coupling has gotten some attention @xcite due to its plausibility .",
    "most of the works have concentrated on direct detections of dm .",
    "the main motivation for the magnetic dipole interacting dm scenario is that the magnetic dipole coupling can be sizable compared to other electromagnetic couplings , because the magnetic dipole conserves the discrete symmetries like parity ( p ) , time reversal ( t ) , and charge conjugation ( c ) or its combinations .    in this work ,",
    "we consider cosmic ray signatures ( indirect detections ) of the direct dipole - interacting dm with the shifted photon ( hypercharge gauge boson @xmath2 ) .",
    "the cosmic ray signatures in the positron , antiproton and photon channels are considered for the dm mass near the electroweak scale @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , essentially around 100 gev . the dimension-5 operator which induces the dipole interaction is @xmath5 , and",
    "it may be expressed with photon and @xmath6 boson in the standard model context since the hypercharge gauge boson is a linear combination of photon and @xmath6 boson with weinberg angle @xmath7 .",
    "the relevant effective lagrangian is given by@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the field strength for photon , @xmath10 for @xmath6 boson and @xmath11 is the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the dm annihilations therefore produce the standard model particles via @xmath12 exchanges .",
    "the annihilation processes were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in detail , and here we take advantage of the results ( annihilation rates or fractions ) .",
    "the corresponding annihilation fractions are tabulated in table i for our benchmark mass , 100 gev .",
    ".annihilation fractions for each channel , in which @xmath13 denotes up type quarks @xmath14 , @xmath15 down type quarks @xmath16 , @xmath17 neutrinos @xmath18 and @xmath19 charged leptons @xmath20 .",
    "five fundamental channels are considered for dark matter mass of 100 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the antiproton flux is then given by@xmath21 where the function @xmath22 encodes all the astrophysics , and the full expression can be found in refs .",

    "2 shows the predicted ratios of antiproton over proton with the computed background @xcite and several experimental measurements . as in the case of the positrons , the predictions have almost no difference in the halo profiles , but they are sensitive to the propagation models .",
    "the predictions in the min propagation model are selected , and they may be within the invisible range for current detectors .",
    "however , this scenario is most likely ruled out for other propagation models , med and max , because the predicted fluxes in med or max propagation model are about ten or one hundred times larger than the ones in the min propagation model .",
    "the production of gamma - rays has been considered to be a very important channel to search for the dm signals , since they travel in straight lines and can travel greater distances without energy loss . for these reasons",
    ", they contain spectral and directional information that can be well measured .",
    "the gamma - ray flux from the dm annihilations at a given photon energy from a direction that forms an angle @xmath23 between the direction of the galactic center and that of observation is accounted for by the line - of - sight ( los ) integration method,@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the galactocentric distance . in terms of the galactic latitude @xmath26 and longitude @xmath27 ,",
    "one has @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath30 parameterizes the distance from the sun along the los .",
    "this form can be reduced to@xmath31 where @xmath32 is a dimensionless los integral averaged over the solid angle @xmath33 and is defined by@xmath34 with@xmath35    [ ptb ]    fig3.eps    in addition to the continuum emission , the direct dm annihilations produce @xmath36 and @xmath37 final states or @xmath6 final state is prohibited , because in this process it is impossible to conserve energy and momentum together . ] in this scenario , in which feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "3 . such processes would yield the very distinctive feature of monoenergetic gamma - ray lines ( monochromatic photons ) with an energy @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the full annihilation rates for the production of @xmath36 are @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 the contributions for @xmath36 and @xmath37 final states are suppressed by the magnetic dipole @xmath43 , and the @xmath37 final state has an additional suppression with weinberg angle @xmath44 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the possible signals from the galactic halo for a complementarity in the case of the positrons , and the same boost factors for a reference .",
    "the main idea of the enhancement from subhalo structure comes from @xmath45 . ]",
    "@xmath46 are selected .",
    "we compare our predictions to experimental observations in two stringent cases .",
    "one is a process that may contribute to the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egb ) .",
    "the other is , in the case that astrophysical sources account for the egb in the entire energy range , a process which satisfies the experimental exclusion limit of the fermi lat @xcite .",
    "4 shows the predicted gamma - ray spectra as a function of photon energy in the region @xmath47 .",
    "the spectra are superpositions of the continuum and monoenergetic gamma - rays at the dm mass of 100 gev .",
    "the spectra have almost no difference in the halo profiles .",
    "the egb from the fermi lat @xcite is given by @xmath48 the same type of background from the analysis of the egret measurements is also described @xcite from the first analysis @xcite .",
    "the predicted spectra are not exceeding the egb , and we might have a signature if it can be disentangled from astrophysical ones .",
    "in addition , we check if our prediction can account for the egret anomaly which is not confirmed at the fermi lat .",
    "our predictions are too soft to explain the observation of the egb , and the more enhancement would be needed .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig4.eps    the predicted fluxes have to be within the uncertainty of fermi lat data , in the case that the egb is accounted for by astrophysical sources in the entire energy range .",
    "5 shows the predicted fluxes with 90% , 95% and 99% c.l .",
    "experimental limits of the fermi lat , which are estimated from the data table in ref .",
    "the predictions are smaller than the exclusion limits , and so satisfy the current experimental constraint .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig5.eps    the galactic center or the region close to it must be the most complex region in the galaxy due to many possible sources and the difficulty to model the diffuse emission . hence , it may be very difficult to disentangle possible dm annihilation signals from the background fluxes .",
    "the monochromatic gamma - ray lines appearing from dm annihilations could provide smoking - gun signatures for these regions , because the line signals mostly can not be mistaken for astrophysical source .",
    "6 shows the predicted annihilation rate for @xmath36 and @xmath37 final states as a function of the dm mass .",
    "the sommerfeld effect is included , but not the subhalo structure .",
    "the strength of dm magnetic dipole is chosen to satisfy the relic density from ref .",
    "the curves given for the nfw , einasto , and isothermal dm distributions are 95% c.l .",
    "upper limits of fermi lat @xcite for the region of @xmath49 plus a @xmath50 square centered at the galactic center .",
    "the predicted annihilation rates are approximately @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53s at @xmath54 gev for the @xmath36 final state and @xmath55 @xmath53s for the @xmath56 final state at @xmath57 gev . otherwise , the estimated upper limits at the fermi lat are @xmath58 @xmath53s for both final states , depending on the dm mass and the halo profiles .",
    "the predictions are two or three orders smaller than the experimental upper limits . however , our predictions can be enhanced if dense dm clumps are considered in regions close to the galactic center .",
    "recently , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite pointed out the gamma - ray excess , @xmath59@xmath60/s , around 130 gev in the spectrum based on these measurements with 4.5 or 6@xmath61 statistical significance .",
    "our predictions with the subhalo boost factor of about 100 can account for the gamma - ray excess .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig6.eps    one of the reasons we mostly get the low predictions for sharp peaks is due to the relatively poor energy resolution .",
    "the current energy resolution of the fermi lat is @xmath62 @xcite in the full width at half maximum",
    ". the energy resolution could be as good as @xmath63 for a planned experiment , ams-02 @xcite , in which the upper limits of annihilation rate will be @xmath64 @xmath53s .",
    "our predicted signals are in the potential probe at the ams-02 .",
    "we considered cosmic ray signals in the positron , antiproton and photon channels of dipole - interacting dm annihilation .",
    "the predicted signals in the positron channel could nicely account for the excess of positron fraction from fermi lat , pamela , heat and ams-01 experiments for the dm mass larger than 100 gev with a boost factor of @xmath0 .",
    "an enhancement of about a factor of 16 could come from the sommerfeld non - perturbative effect and the rest , an enhancement factor of @xmath65 , from subhalo structure ( dark clumps ) .",
    "the predicted signals have almost no dependence on the dm mass because of the sommerfeld effect .",
    "no excess of antiproton over proton ratio at the experiments also gives a severe restriction for our scenario .",
    "this scenario may be viable for min galactic propagation model , but likely ruled out for other propagation models , med and max .",
    "the predicted signals from the galactic halo in the region @xmath66 and signals as the monoenergetic gamma - ray lines ( monochromatic photons ) for the region ( @xmath67 plus a @xmath50 square centered at the galactic center ) close to the galactic center were also considered .",
    "the predicted signals from the galactic halo must satisfy the current experimental constraint , and the signals for the region near the galactic center as monoenergetic lines must be smaller than the experimental exclusion limits of the fermi lat .",
    "the gamma - ray excess @xmath59@xmath60/s around 130 gev , pointed out by the authors of refs .",
