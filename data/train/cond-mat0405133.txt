    "the structural elements such as individual atoms , group of atoms ( bases , sugar rings , phosphates ) fragments of double chain including several base pairs , are in constant movements and this movement plays crucial role in its biological activities . during transcription a transient `` bubble '' of single stranded is formed , to allow enzymes that make a mrna copy of  sequence to access the  bases @xcite . in a replication",
    "the separation of two strands starts from one end and propagates to the other end ; separated parts of each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new strand and thus making two exact copies of the .",
    "the energy involved in these processes is of the order of 5 - 25 kcal / mole .",
    "these motions _ in vitro _ can be activated by increasing temperature , changing ph and/or solvent conditions .",
    "the process of separating the two strands wound in a double helix into two single strands upon heating is known as thermal denaturation .",
    "several experiments on dilute  solutions @xcite have provided evidence for the existence of a thermally driven melting transition corresponding to the sudden opening of base pairs at a denaturation or melting temperature @xmath4 .    in the living organisms",
    "the  strands are forced open by proteins which pull the strands of  on selected positions .",
    "the recently developed experimental techniques of micromanipulations and nanomanipulations @xcite have now made it possible to probe the force elongation characteristics of double stranded  molecule ( ds ) , determining its response to external force and torque _ in vitro _ at temperatures where ds  is thermally stable in absence of the external force .",
    "the mechanical unzipping of ds  by a force pulling the end of one of the two strands , the end of the other strand being anchored to some physical support ( see fig .",
    "1 ) has been studied by bockelmann and co - workers @xcite who measured the average force for the opening of the two strands .",
    "it has been shown that the two strands of a ds  can be pulled apart if a force @xmath14 pn is applied with some variation about this mean value depending upon the sequence .    in single molecule experiments ,",
    "the results may depend on the statistical ensemble one works with @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that techniques like atomic force microscope @xcite use the fixed extension ensemble while the magnetic bead method @xcite uses the fixed force ensemble . in view of this",
    "we have studied the unzipping transitions in both the fixed force ( sec . 4 ) and the fixed extension ( sec .",
    "5 ) ensembles .    in order to make a theoretical approach feasible",
    "one has to reduce the complexity of internal motions of ds  to the minimum .",
    "clearly , an appropriate choice of the relevant degrees of freedom depends on the problem one is interested .",
    "for example , the models based on the theory of polymers that use self - avoiding walks to describe the two strands @xcite can be very successful in studying the properties of melting transition at the large scale but they can not be used to investigate the properties that depend on the sequence , or probe the  at the microscopic scale as is done in some single molecule experiments .",
    "one of the simplest models that investigate at the scale of base pairs is the peyrard - bishop model @xcite . though as described in sec .",
    "2 , this model ignores the helicoidal structure @xcite of , it is found to have enough details to analyze mechanical behaviour at the few @xmath15 scale relevant to molecular - biological events .",
    "a number of attempts have recently been made to understand various aspects of dsdna unzipping @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to give further insight on the various intricacies involved in the unzipping of ds . in particular , we investigate how the unzipping transition depends on the different parameters that appear in the model hamiltonian and on the presence of defect base pairs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we describe in detail the different parts of the peyrard - bishop ( pb ) model and the set of potential parameters that we use in our study . in sec .",
    "3 we provide a brief outline of the theory that is used to investigate the transitions in a homogeneous ds .",
    "this theory is used in sec .",
    "iv to calculate the value of critical force , @xmath0 , for unzipping as a function of temperature .",
    "the curve @xmath0 gives the boundary separating the zipped state from the unzipped state .",
    "the critical force is shown to depend most predominantly on the stiffness associated with a single strand . in sec .",
    "5 we investigate the unzipping of ds  in a constant extension ensemble and calculate the average force needed to maintain the extension .",
    "it is shown that a very large force is needed to enforce an extension of about @xmath16 and the value of this force depends on the barrier associated with reduction in  strand rigidity as one passes from ds  to ss .",
    "the change in height and position of the barrier is investigated by introducing defect base pairs .",
    "the extension can take place at any point along the strand .",
    "we have discussed the two cases ; the extension at one end and at the middle .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "since the internal motion that is predominantly responsible for unzipping of ds  in situation shown in figure 1 is the stretching of the bases from their equilibrium position along the direction of the hydrogen bonds that connect the two bases , a  molecule can be considered as a quasi one dimensional lattice composed of @xmath17 base pair units .",
    "the forces which stabilize the structure are the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases on opposite strands and stacking interactions between nearest neighbour bases on opposite strands .",
    "each base pair is in one of the two states : either open(non hydrogen bonded ) or zipped ( hydrogen bonded ) . in the presence of a force acting on one end of the base pair , the hamiltonian can be written as , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the stretching from the equilibrium position of the hydrogen bonds connecting the two bases of the @xmath20 pair .",
    "a model hamiltonian that contains the minimum complexity of the internal motion at base pairs level and accounts for the stability of ds  structure is @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced mass of a base pair , and @xmath23 the on - site potential @xmath24 describes the interaction of the two bases of the @xmath20 pair .",
    "the morse potential @xmath25 is generally taken to represent the on - site interaction .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath24 does not represent only the hydrogen bonds connecting two bases belonging to opposite strands , but also the surrounding solvent effects and the repulsion interactions of the phosphates . in eq .",
    "( 4 ) @xmath26 measures the depth of the potential and @xmath27 its range . in a homogeneous ,",
    "@xmath26 is taken to be site independent but in a heterogeneous ( or natural )  the value of @xmath26 depends on whether the @xmath20 base pair is at or cg .",
    "the flat part at large values of the displacement of this potential emulates the tendency of the pair `` melt '' at high temperatures as thermal phonons drive the molecule outside the well and towards the flat portion of the potential .",
    "the stacking interactions are contributed by dipole - dipole interactions , @xmath28-electron systems , london dispersion forces and in water solution , the solvent induced hydrophobic interactions .",
    "these forces result in a complex interaction pattern between overlapping base pairs , with minimum energy distance close to 3.4 @xmath15 in the normal  double helix .",
    "as suggested by peyrard and bishop @xcite the following anharmonic potential model mimic the essential features of the stacking energy : @xmath29 ( y_n - y_{n+1})^2\\ ] ] where the force constant @xmath1 is related with the stiffness of a single strand and the second term in the bracket represents the anharmonic term .",
    "the `` anharmonic range '' is defined by the parameter @xmath30 . in the zipped state",
    "the force constant is equal to @xmath31 .",
    "decrease in the force constant in the unzipped state provides a large entropy and hence favours unzipping either at high force or at high temperatures .",
    "the difference in the force constants between the zipped and the unzipped state of base pairs , creates an energy barrier the value of which depends on @xmath32 and range @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian model described above has five parameters @xmath26 , @xmath1 , @xmath32 , @xmath27 and @xmath30 . in our calculation",
    "described below we have taken @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "for the reduced mass @xmath22 , a value of 300 a.m.u . has been used . for both sets of parameters the denaturation temperature in absence of force is found close to 350 k ( see below ) which , in turn is close to the value found for a natural .",

    "the order of the transition is determined by the exponent @xmath67 which characterize the gap @xmath68 at temperature @xmath69 ; a value @xmath70 implies a cusp in the free energy and a discontinuous entropy , a feature of first order transition , whereas a value equal to 2 corresponds to 2nd order transition .",

    "when a force @xmath49 is applied on one end of the ds  as shown in fig .",

    "thus from eqs.(20 ) and ( 21 ) one gets the expression for @xmath0 given by eq.(18 ) .    the curve @xmath0 plotted in fig .",
    "4 gives the boundary that separates the zipped state of  from the unzipped state in @xmath111 plane .",
    "we may note that the value of @xmath0 for the set of potential parameters ( i ) is less than that of the force parameters of set ( ii ) and this difference increases with ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "this behaviour can easily be understood from the fact that the value of @xmath0 depends on the product of @xmath113 .",
    "since @xmath114 is proportional to @xmath44 having values equal to @xmath2 at @xmath115 k and zero at @xmath116 , we have @xmath117 at a given @xmath44 the value of @xmath0 depends on @xmath118 as for both sets of parameters @xmath4 are nearly equal .",
    "this explains the difference in the value of @xmath0 found for the two sets of parameters .",
    "equation ( 22 ) is important as it gives the dependence of @xmath0 on the stiffness of single strand , the potential well depth of interaction in a base pair and on the temperature .",
    "it may , however , be noted that the experimental verification of eq.(18 ) or ( 22 ) requires that the forces that stabilize the ds  structure and have been included in the hamiltonian ( see sec .",

    "8 , 9 and 13 , the peak in the @xmath7 curve can be made to occur at larger values of the extension @xmath8 by replacing some of the base pairs by defect base pairs . from these results it therefore seems possible to use defects to create the force barrier at such extensions of a base pair that the peak in @xmath7 curve can be measured directly in an experiment .",

    "this is because the barrier that gives peak in @xmath7 curve in this case remains at the same location as in the defectless case ; the decrease in the value of force at the peak is primarily due to loss of hydrogen bonds energy in the base pair .",

    "this has been attributed to difference in the entropic contributions which reduces the barrier height that gives the peak in @xmath7 curve .    stretching a base pair at one of the ends of a ds  molecule",
    "creates a fork of y shape which moves along the chain on increasing the extension , @xmath8 , of the end base pair .",
    "its size for a given extension @xmath8 depends on the temperature as shown in fig .",
    "the number of base pairs that get open on initiation of the formation of the fork depend rather sensitively on the anharmonic term in the stacking energy .",
    "however , after certain size of the fork the number of base pairs that get open depend linearly on the extension @xmath8 as shown in fig . 11 .    when the middle ( or any base pair far away from the ends ) base pair is stretched a bubble of ss  with the shape of an eye is formed . in a homogeneous ds  molecule",
    "the bubble move symmetrically on both sides on increasing the extension of the middle base pair .",
    "this may not , however , happen in case of a heterogeneous ds  molecule .",
    "the method of matrix multiplications used in calculating the properties in the constant extension ensemble can also be applied to a heterogeneous dsmolecule .",

    "<S> the value of @xmath7 needed to stretch a base pair located far away from the ends of a ds  molecule is found twice the value of the force needed to stretch a base pair located at one of the ends to the same distance for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the force @xmath7 in both cases is found to have a very large value for @xmath10 compared to the critical force found from the constant force ensemble to which @xmath7 approaches for large values of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the value of @xmath7 at the peak depends on the value of @xmath11 which measures the energy barrier associated with the reduction in  strand rigidity as one passes from ds  to ssdna and on the value of the depth of the on - site potential . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of defects on the position and height of the peak in @xmath7 curve is investigated by replacing some of the base pairs including the one being stretched by defect base pairs . the formation and behaviour of a loop of y shape when one of the ends base pair is stretched and a bubble of ss  with the shape of `` an eye '' when a base pair far from ends is stretched are investigated . </S>"
