    "the proposals for quantum information processing have important developments in the spin qubits of quantum dots @xcite . as the heart of solid state quantum computation",
    ", the forms of the exchange interaction between qubits have been recognized from the isotropic heisenberg interaction @xcite to anisotropic ones @xcite .",
    "the interactions have very short range in the context of these previous schemes .",
    "this often leads to constraints on the architecture @xcite and serious technical obstacles @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is enlightening to find out one kind of long range effective interaction for quantum information processing .",
    "recently , the scheme for a quantum bus of a spin chain has been put forward @xcite . through the electrical control of external spin qubits of loss and divincenzo type @xcite ,",
    "the long range isotropic heisenberg interaction is demonstrated in the work @xcite where the bus is considered as a effective qubit .",
    "however , after each quantum logic operation , the spin bus must be initialized into its working space .",
    "apparently , this gives rise to the complexity of the operating mode . in condensed matters ,",
    "coupled spin chains are very typical for quantum many body systems .",
    "different from one single spin-@xmath0 chain , two coupled chains exhibit the natural energy gap @xcite . the gapped systems like two coupled spin chains can be experimentally prepared by the arrays of quantum dots . here",
    "we show how to engineer two coupled chains as a spin bus for the realization of quantum information processing .",
    "our method can identify arbitrary single - qubit gates and controlled - not one by electrically controlling the weak coupling between spin qubits and the bus . during the whole process , the spin bus can not share quantum information , which reduces the complication in the operation sequence .    in this paper , two strongly coupled spin chains with the anisotropic heisenberg xxz exchange interaction are regarded as a bus .",
    "the form of effective interaction is analytically given in sec .",
    "the effective interaction can be tuned by the variations of the anisotropy and weak coupling between spin qubits and the bus . in sec .",
    "iii , the universal set of quantum logic gates is realized .",
    "the effect of quantum fluctuations in the spin bus is taken into account .",
    "a discussion concludes the paper .",
    "in our method , the whole quantum system involves a bus of two coupled chains and external computational spin qubits which are weakly connected to the bus . for the qubits of the loss and divincenzo type , the weak coupling can be electrically manipulated .",
    "if the bus system is always frozen at the ground state , the long range effective interaction can be attained at the computational qubits where quantum information can be efficiently processed .",
    "the total hamiltonian in this system is written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the bus and @xmath3 describes the weak interaction between computational spin qubits and the bus .",
    "the general case of the bus system @xmath2 with the heisenberg xxz anisotropic exchange is considered as @xmath4 here @xmath5 denotes the spin operator at the @xmath6-th site of the @xmath7-th chain .",
    "the first item of eq .",
    "( 2 ) implies the chain with the anisotropy @xmath8 and second item describes the strong antiferromagnetic coupling between two chains .",
    "when the computational spin qubits @xmath9 and @xmath10 are weakly coupled to the bus at the connecting nodes @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the interaction can be expressed by @xmath13 .",
    "the bus system has the non - degenerate ground state @xmath14 with the energy @xmath15 and the first excited state @xcite .",
    "due to so large energy gap , the system can be frozen at the ground state when the physical temperature @xmath16 is much smaller than the gap .",
    "the effective hamiltonian between two computational qubits @xmath17 can be obtained in this condition . through the use of the standard canonical transformation formalism @xcite , the effective hamiltonian of the whole system",
    "can be expressed by @xmath18 because the total spin at the ground state @xmath14 is zero , the mean value @xmath19 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath20 .",
    "the projector @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-th excited degenerate state with the energy @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the degree of degeneracy for this state .",
    "thus , the expression of @xmath17 is given by @xmath26 where the constant @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "it is shown that the parameters @xmath30 are determined by the energy spectra of the bus system .",
    "for this transient invariant quantum system @xmath2 , the energy spectrum can be calculated .",
    "it is found out that these parameters satisfy the relation as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is real and eq .",
    "( 5 ) is zero if @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 under the assumption of @xmath35 . in general , the effective hamiltonian of two computational qubits is written in form of the anisotropic heisenberg interaction @xmath36+c_{eff}$ ] .",
    "it is seen that the effective long range interactions @xmath37 primarily rely on the properties of the bus .    to analytically give the effective interactions , the simplest case of @xmath38",
    "is considered .",
    "the energy spectra and corresponding eigenstates of @xmath2 for @xmath39 $ ] are spanned in the product hilbert space for all of the spins in the bus    @xmath40    here the basis of the space @xmath41 labels @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the eigenstate of the spin operator @xmath44 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath45 .",

    "for the special case of @xmath49 , the roots @xmath50 and the corresponding coefficients are obtained as @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . therefore , if the computational qubits are weakly coupled to the bus , we can calculate the effective interactions by @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the condition of @xmath57 , the antiferromagnetic interactions @xmath37 can be attained if the weak couplings are chosen as @xmath58 .",
    "the effects of the anisotropy on the long range interactions are shown by fig .",
    "it is seen that the effective interaction @xmath59 is almost linearly decreased with the increase of the anisotropy @xmath60 in fig .",
    "1(a ) . here",
    "the effective anisotropy @xmath61 is also illustrated by fig .",
    "these values almost take on the exponential increase . at the point of @xmath49 ,",
    "the effective anisotropy is the maximal value of one where the isotropic heisenberg interaction occurs .",
    "the connecting nodes of the bus are labeled in the new sequence given by fig .",
    "similar to the results of @xcite , the effective interactions @xmath62 alternately occurs between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ones . to clearly show this character ,",
    "the effective interaction is plotted with respect to the distance @xmath63 between two nodes by fig .",
    "2 . it is found that the coefficient of the effective interaction @xmath64 when the distance @xmath63 is odd .",
    "and the values of @xmath65 decays almost exponentially .",
    "the opposite case is shown in the condition that @xmath63 is even . with the increase of the length of the chains",
    ", we also calculate the effective interactions . from fig .",
    "2(c ) , it is seen that @xmath66 is gradually increased to the certain value with length @xmath67 .",
    "this fact demonstrates that the effective interaction can also be obtained in coupled chains with infinite size .",
    "after the evolution of the system , quantum information will be manipulated in the computational qubits under the assumption that the bus is always frozen at the ground state .",
    "it is the advantage that the distances of quantum logic operations can be enlarged much more . to implement the universal quantum computation",
    ", we need realize a set of quantum logic gates which consist of arbitrary single - qubit and controlled - not one . according to @xcite ,",
    "an efficient way to construct the exact controlled - not logic gate can be provided for the general heisenberg xxz interaction @xmath68 where the controlled phase flip gate @xmath69 \\exp[i\\frac { 2\\pi}{3}\\vec{n_{2}}\\cdot ( \\vec{\\tau}_{a}+\\vec{\\tau}_{b})/\\hbar]u(\\frac { \\pi}{2})r_{a}^{y}(-\\pi ) u(\\frac { \\pi}{2})r_{a}^{x}(\\frac { \\pi}{2})r_{b}^{x}(\\frac { \\pi}{2})$ ] . here",

    "for the case of @xmath49 , the exact swap gate is obtained by @xmath75 $ ] and the swap time @xmath76 . from eq .",
    "( 7 ) , it is seen that the controlled - not gate needs to be implemented by means of some single - qubit operations .",
    "it is necessary to study how to operate the single - qubit rotations . when only one computational qubit @xmath9 is coupled to the node @xmath77 of the bus and the local magnetic field @xmath78",
    "is applied , the hamiltonian of the whole system is written by @xmath79 .",
    "similarly , the effective hamiltonian can also be given by @xmath80 is chosen , the unitary operation after the certain time is expressed by @xmath81 where @xmath82 .",
    "it is shown that the single - qubit unitary rotation is operated by one computational qubit in the local field which is connected to the bus .",
    "therefore , the universal quantum computation can be realized in the bus of two coupled chains .",
    "it is noted that during the whole process of quantum logic operations the adiabatic criterion is satisfied in order to avoid the crossing of the energy levels . according to @xcite",
    ", the adiabatic criterion can be expressed by @xmath83 for the case of @xmath49 .",
    "owing to the previous work of @xcite , the energy gap of the bus @xmath84 . from the above calculation , @xmath85 .",

    "that is , the adiabatic criterion can be achieved @xmath89 .",
    "this shows that coupled chains with infinite size can be served as the bus for quantum information processing .",

    ", the certain quantum fluctuations always exist in the bus . to clearly show the effects of the fluctuations on quantum computation , small variations of the anisotropy in the nodes of @xmath93",

    "the error can be analytically given by @xmath100 } , \\sqrt{2[1-\\cos\\frac { \\pi\\delta_z}{4 } ] } \\}\\ ] ] where the parameters @xmath101 and @xmath102 . here",
    "@xmath103 is the coefficient of the effective interaction with the fluctuations of the anisotropy while @xmath104 is the one without the fluctuations .",
    "the error of the operator is shown in fig .",

    ", the order of the error can be decreased to @xmath109 which is well below than the threshold @xmath110 for the fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "the gapped spin system of two coupled chains is served as the bus . during the whole process , the bus can always be frozen at the ground state for the large energy gap . by weakly connecting external computational spin qubits with the bus , the effective long range interactions can be attained . if two computational qubits are coupled , the effective hamiltonian has the form of anisotropic heisenberg xxz which can be useful for the construction of the controlled - not gate .",
    "it is found that the effective interaction alternately occurs between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ones .",
    "the effective interaction can be constructed in coupled chains with infinite size .",
    "the values decay almost exponential with increasing the distance of two nodes . in regard to only one qubit connected to the bus , single - qubit rotations can be implemented by the local magnetic field . therefore , the universal quantum computation can be realized in the long range which can eliminate the technical difficulty arising from the exchange of short distances .",
    "meanwhile , compared with the proposal of @xcite , the operating sequence of quantum information processing can be simplified .",
