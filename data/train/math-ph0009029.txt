    "why has mathematical physics become so universal ? does it allow the proper formulation of usual physical problems ?",
    "some reasons explain the popularity of mathematical physics .",
    "one reason is practical : mathematical physical theories may condensate a huge number of experimental results in a few functional relationships .",
    "perhaps more importantly , these relationships usually have a tremendous power of extrapolation , allowing the prediction of the outcome of experiments never performed .",
    "psychologically , this capacity of predicting the outcome of experiments gives the very satisfactory feeling of `` understanding '' .    today , most scientists accept popper s ( [ note : popper ] ) point of view that physics advances by postulating mathematical relations between physical parameters . while it is fully recognized that physical theories should be confronted with experiments , popper emphasized that sucessful predictions , in whatever number , can never prove that a theory is correct , but one single observation that contradicts the predictions of the theory is enough to refute , to falsify the whole theory .",
    "he also stressed that these contradictory results are of uttermost importance for the advance of physics .",
    "when michelson and morley ( [ note : michelsonandmorley ] ) could not find the predicted difference in the speed of light when the observer changes its velocity relative to the source , they broke the ground for the replacement of classical by relativistic mechanics .",
    "physical theories are conceptual models of reality .",
    "a good physical theory contains some or all of the following elements :    \\i ) a modelisation of the space - time ( for instance , as a four - dimensional continuum , or as a fractal entity )    \\ii ) a modelisation of the objects of the `` universe '' ( for instance , as point particles , or as continuous media )    \\iii ) a recognition of the significant parameters in the experiments to be performed and a precise , operational , definition of these parameters    \\iv ) mathematical relations postulated between these parameters , obtained by trying to obtain the best fit between observations and theoretical predictions .    while no physics is possible without points ( i - iii ) above , point ( iv ) , i.e.",
    ", postulating functional relations between the parameters to be used is not a necessity .    any physical knowledge is uncertain , and estimation of uncertainties is crucial , for prosaic ( e.g. , preventing mechanical structures to collapse ) as well as ethereal ( e.g. , using experimental results to decide between theories ) reasons . the problem we face is that while considerable effort is spent in estimating experimental uncertainties , once a theory is postulated that is acceptable in view of these uncertainties , usual mathematical physics reasons as if the theory was exact .",
    "for instance , while we can use gravitation theory to predict the behaviour of space - time near the big - bang of certain models of the universe , we have no means of estimating how uncertain are our predictions .",
    "this is more striking when using analytical theories to solve the so - called `` inverse problems '' ( [ note : backus][note : mosegaardandtarantola ] ) , where data , a priori information , and `` physical theories '' have to be used to make inferences about some parameters .",
    "the consideration of exact theories leads , at best , to inaccurate estimations , at worst , to mathematical inconsistencies ( [ note : unconsistency ] ) .",
    "this paper proposes an alternative to the common practice of postulating functional relationships between physical parameters .",
    "in fact , we propose a mathematical formalization of pure empiricism , as opposed to mathematical rationalism .",
    "essentially , we suggest to replace functional relationships between physical parameters by well defined probability distributions over the parameter space",
    ".    the proposed formalism will , in some sense , only be a sort of `` tabulation '' of systematically performed experiments .",
    "in some aspects it will be less powerful than the one obtained through the use of analytical theories ( it will not be able to extrapolate ) ; in some aspects it will be more powerful ( it will be able to properly handle actual uncertainties )",
    ".    we will show how experiments could be , at least in principle , systematically performed so that a probability distribution in the parameter space is obtained that contains , as an analytical theory , the observed correlations between physical parameters , but , in addition , contains the full description of the attached uncertainties .",
    "we will also explain how , once such a theoretical probability distribution has been obtained , we can use it to make predictions that will have attached uncertainties or to use data to solve general inverse problems .",
    "to fulfill this project we need to complete classical probability theory . kolmogorov ( [ note : kolmogorov ] ) proposed an axiomatic introduction of the notion of probability distribution over a space .",
    "the definition of conditional probability is then the starting point for doing inferences , as , for instance , through the use of the bayes theorem .",
    "but the space of all probability distributions ( over a given space ) lacks structure .",
    "we argue below that there are two natural operations , the  and the  operation , to be defined over the probability distributions , that create the necessary structure : that of an inference space",
    ". we will see that while the  operation corresponds to an obvious generalization of `` making histograms '' from observed results , the  operation is just the right generalization of the notion of conditional probability .",
    "before kolmogorov ( [ note : kolmogorov ] ) , probability calculus was made using the intuitive notions of `` chance '' or `` hazard '' . kolmogorov s axioms clarified the underlying mathematical structure and brought probability calculus inside well defined mathematics . in this section",
    "we will recall these axioms .",
    "our opinion is that the use in physical theories ( where we have invariance requirements ) of probability distributions , through the notions of conditional probability or the so - called bayesian paradigm suffers today from the same defects as probability calculus suffered from before kolmogorov . to remedy this ,",
    "we introduce in this section , in the space of all probability distributions , two logical operations (  and ) that give the necessary mathematical structure to the space .",
    "a point  @xmath0  , that can materialize itself anywhere inside a domain  @xmath1  , may be realized , for instance , inside  @xmath2  , a subdomain of  @xmath3  .",
    "the probability of realization of the point is completely described if we have introduced a _ probability distribution _ ( in kolmogorov s [ [ note : kolmogorov ] ] sense ) on  @xmath3  , i.e. , if to every subdomain  @xmath2   of  @xmath1  we are able to associate a real number  @xmath4  , called _ the probability of _",
    "@xmath2  , having the three properties :    @xmath5   -3 pt for any subdomain  @xmath2  of  @xmath6  ,  @xmath7  .",
    "@xmath5   -3 pt if  @xmath8  and  @xmath9  are two disjoint subsets of  @xmath3  , then ,  @xmath10",
    ".    @xmath5   for a sequence of events  @xmath11   tending to the empty set , we have  @xmath12  .",
    "we will not necessarily assume that a probability distribution is normed to unity (  @xmath13  ) .",
    "although one refers to this as a _ measure _ , instead of a probability , we will not use this distinction .",
    "sometimes , our probability distributions will not be normalizable at all (  @xmath14  ) .",
    "we can only then compute the _ relative probabilities _ of subdomains .",
    "these axioms apply to probability distributions over discrete or continuous spaces .",
    "below , we will consider probability distributions over spaces of physical parameters , that are continuous spaces .",
    "then , a probability distribution is represented by a probability density ( note [ [ note : radon - nicodym ] ] explains the difference between a probability density and a volumetric probability ) .    in the next section ,",
    "given a space  @xmath3  , we will consider different probability distributions  @xmath15   each probability distribution will represent a particular _ state of information _ over  @xmath3  . in",
    "what follows , we will use as synonymous the terms `` probability distribution '' and `` state of information '' .",
    "we will now give a structure to the space of all the probability distributions over a given space , by introducing two operations , the  and the  operation .",
    "this contrasts with the basic operations introduced in deductive logic , where the negation ( `` '' ) , nonexistent here , plays a central role . in",
    "what follows , the  and the  operation will be denoted , symbollically , by  @xmath16  and  @xmath17  .",
    "they are assumed to satisfy the set of axioms here below .",
    "the first axiom states that if an event  @xmath2  is possible for  @xmath18  @xmath19  , then the event is either possible for  @xmath20  or possible for  @xmath21   ( which his is consistent with the usual logical sense for the `` or '' ) : _ for any subset  @xmath22  , and for any two probability distributions  @xmath20  and  @xmath21  , the  operation satisfies @xmath23 the word `` or '' having here its ordinary logical sense . _",
    "the second axiom states that if an event  @xmath2  is possible for  @xmath18  @xmath19  , then the event is possible for both  @xmath20  and  @xmath21   ( which is consistent with the usual logical sense for the `` and '' ) : _ for any subset  @xmath22  , and for any two probability distributions  @xmath20  and  @xmath21  , the  operation satisfies @xmath24 the word `` and '' having here its ordinary logical sense .",
    "_    the third axiom ensures the existence of a neutral element , that will be interpreted below as the probability distribution carrying no information at all : _ there is a _ neutral element _",
    ",  @xmath25  for the   operation , i.e. , it exists a  @xmath25  such that for any probability distribution  @xmath26  and for any subset  @xmath22  , _",
    "@xmath27    the fourth axiom imposes that _ the  and the   operations are _ commutative _ and _ associative _ _ , and , by analogy with the algebra of propositions of ordinary logic , have a distributivity property : _ the  operation is _ distributive _ with respect to the  operation_.    the structure obtained when furnishing the space of all probability distributions ( over a given space  @xmath3  ) with two operations  and , satisfying the given axioms constitutes what we propose to call an _ inference space_.    these axioms do not define uniquely the operations .",
    "let  @xmath28  be the particular probability density representing  @xmath29  , the neutral element for the  operation , and let  @xmath30  be the probability densities representing the probability distributions  @xmath31   using the notations  @xmath32  and  @xmath33  for the probability densities representing the probability distributions  @xmath34  and  @xmath35  respectively , one realization of the axioms ( the one we will retain ) is given by @xmath36 where one should remember that we do not impose to our probability distributions to be normalized .",
    "the structure of an inference space , as defined , contains other useful solutions .",
    "for instance , the theory of fuzzy sets ( [ note : kandel ] ) uses positive functions  @xmath37   quite similar to probability densities , but having a different interpretation : the are normed by the condition that their maximum value equals one , and are interpreted as the `` grades of membership '' of a point  @xmath38  to the `` fuzzy sets ''  @xmath39  .",
    "the operations  and  correspond then respectively to the _ union _ and _ intersection _ of fuzzy sets , and to the following realization of our axioms : @xmath40 where the neutral element for the  operation ( intersection of fuzzy sets ) is simply the function  @xmath41  .    while fuzzy set theory is an alternative to classical probability ( and is aimed at the solution of a different class of problems ) , our aim here is only to complete the classical probability theory .",
    "as explained below the solution given by equations  [ eq : wewant ] correspond to the natural generalisation of two fundamental operations in classical probability theory : that of `` making histograms '' and that of taking `` conditional probabilities '' . to simplify our language",
    ", we will sometimes use this correspondence between our theory and the fuzzy set theory , and will say that the  operation , when applied to two probability distributions , corresponds to the _ union _ of the two states of information , while the  operation corresponds to their _",
    "intersection_.    it is easy to write some extra conditions that distinguish the two solutions given by equations  [ eq : wewant ] and  [ eq : wenotwant ] . for instance , as probability densities are normed using a multiplicative constant ( this is not the case with the grades of membership in fuzzy set theory ) , it makes sense to impose the simplest possible algebra for the multiplication of probability densities  @xmath37   by constants  @xmath42  : @xmath43 ( \\bfx )   = \\left ( \\lambda \\ , p",
    "\\vee \\mu p \\right ) ( \\bfx ) \\qquad ; \\qquad \\left [ \\lambda ( p \\wedge q ) \\right ] ( \\bfx )   =   \\left ( \\lambda p \\wedge q \\right ) ( \\bfx )   =   \\left ( p \\wedge   \\lambda q \\right ) ( \\bfx ) \\ .\\ ] ] this is different from finding a ( minimal ) set of axioms characterizing ( uniquely ) the proposed solution , which is an open problem .",
    "one important property of the two operations  and   just introduced is that of _ invariance _ with respect to a change of variables . as we consider probability distribution over a continuous space , and as our definitons are independent of any choice of coordinates over the space",
    ", it must happen that we obtain equivalent results in any coordinate system .",
    "changing for instance from the coordinates  @xmath38  to some other coordinates  @xmath44  , will change a probability density  @xmath45  to  @xmath46  .",
    "it can easily be seen ( [ note : demoinvariance ] ) that performing the  or the  operation , then changing variables , gives the same result than first changing variables , then , performing the  or the  operation .",
    "let us mention that the equivalent of equations  [ eq : wewant ] for discrete probability distributions is : @xmath47    although the  and  notions just introduced are consistent with classical logic , they are here more general , as they can handle states of information that are more subtle than just the `` possible '' or `` impossible '' ones .",
    "if an experimenter faces realizations of a random process and wants to investigate the probability distribution governing the process , he may start making histograms of the realizations .",
    "for instance , for realizations of a probability distribution over a continuous space , he will obtain histograms that , in some sense , will approach the probability density corresponding to the probability distribution .",
    "a histogram is typically made by dividing the working space into cells , and by counting how many realizations fall inside each cell .",
    "a more subtle approach is possible .",
    "first , we have to understand that , in the physical sciences , when we say `` a random point has materialized in an abstract space '' , we may mean something like `` this object , one among many that may exist , vibrates with some fixed period ; let us measure as accurately as possible its period of oscillation '' .",
    "any physical measure of a real quantity will have attached uncertainties . as explained in section  [ sec : measuring ] , this means that when , mathematically speaking , we measure `` the coordinates of a point in an abstract space '' we will not obtain a point , but a state of information over the space , i.e. , a probability distribution .    if we have measured the coordinates of many points , the results of each measurement will be described by a probability density  @xmath48  .",
    "the union of all these , i.e. , the probability density @xmath49 is a finer estimation of the background probability density than an ordinary histogram , as actual measurement uncertainties are used , irrespectively of any division of the space into cells .",
    "if it happens that the measurement uncertainties can be described using box - car functions at fixed positions , then , the approach we propose reduces to the conventional making of histograms .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "10 cm    figure  [ fig : condens ] explains that our definition of the   operation is a generalization of the notion of conditional probability .",
    "a probability distribution  @xmath50   is represented , in the figure , by its probability density . to any region",
    "@xmath2 of the plane , it associates the probability  @xmath51  .",
    "if a point has been realized following the probability distribution  @xmath50  and we are given the information that , in fact , the point is `` somewhere '' inside the region  @xmath52  , then we can update the prior probability  @xmath50  , replacing it by the conditional probability  @xmath53  .",
    "it equals  @xmath50  inside  @xmath52  and is zero outside ( center of the figure ) .",
    "if instead of the hard constraint  @xmath54   we have a soft information about the location of  @xmath55  , represented by the probability distribution  @xmath56   ( right of the figure ) , the intersection of the two states of information  @xmath20  and  @xmath21  gives a new state of information ( here ,  @xmath57 is the probability density representing the state of null information , and , to simplify the figure , has been assumed to be constant ) .",
    "the comparison of the right with the center of the figure shows that the  operation generalizes the notion of conditional probability . in the special case",
    "where the probability density representing the second state of information ,  @xmath56  , equals the null information probability density inside the domain  @xmath52   and is zero outside , then , the notion of intersection of states of information exactly reduces to the notion of conditional probability .",
    "now the interpretation of the neutral element for the   operation can be made clear .",
    "we postulated that the neutral probability distribution  @xmath29  is such that for any probability distribution  @xmath20  ,  @xmath58  .",
    "this means that if a point is realized according to a probability distribution  @xmath20  , and if a ( finite accuracy ) measure of the coordinates of the point produces the information represented by  @xmath29  , the posterior probability distribution ,  @xmath59   is still  @xmath20  : the probability distribution  @xmath29   is not carrying any information at all .",
    "accordingly , we call  @xmath29  the _ null information probability distribution_. sometimes , the probability density representing this state of null information is constant over all the space ; sometimes , it is not , as explained in section  [ sec : noninf ]",
    ". it is worth mentioning that this particular state of information enters in the shannon s definition of information content ( [ note : shannon-1 ] ,  [ note : shannon-2 ] ) .",
    "it is unfortunate that , when dealing with probability distributions over continous spaces , conditional probabilities are often misused .",
    "note ( [ note : condprob ] ) describes the so - called borel - kolmogorov paradox : using conditional probability densities in a space with coordinates  @xmath60  will give results that will not be consistent with those obtained by the use of conditional probability densities on the same space but where other coordinates  @xmath61  are used ( if the change of coordinates is nonlinear ) .",
    "jaynes ( [ note : jaynes ] ) gives an excellent , explicit , account of the paradox .",
    "but his choice for resolving the paradox is different from our s : while jaynes just insists on the technical details of how some limits have to be taken in order to ensure consistency , we radically decide to abandon the notion of conditional probability , and replace it by the intersection of states of information ( the  operation ) which is naturally consistent under a change of variables , as demonstrated in note ( [ note : demoinvariance ] ) .",
    "crudely speaking , a physical parameter is anything that can be measured . for a physical parameter , like a temperature , an electric field , or a mass , can only be defined by prescribing the experimental procedure that will measure it .",
    "cook ( [ note : cook ] ) discusses this point with lucidity .",
    "the theory to be developed in this article will be illustrated by the analysis of objects that have a characteristic length ,  @xmath62  , affected by phenomena that have a characteristic period ,  @xmath63  .",
    "a measurement of a parameter is performed by realizing the conventional unit ( i.e. , the meter for a length , the second for a duration ) and by comparing the parameter to the unit .",
    "we have then to turn to the definition of the units of time duration and of length .    at present , the _ second _ is defined as the duration of  9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the csium-133 atom .",
    "practically this means that a beam of csium-133 atoms are submitted to an electromagnetic field of adjustable frequency : when the imposed frequency is such that it causes the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the atoms , the standard of frequency ( and , thus , of period ) has been realised .    until 1991 ,",
    "the unit of length used to be defined independently of that of time duration .",
    "now the _ meter _ is connected to the second by defining the value of the velocity of light as  @xmath64 299 792 458 ms@xmath65 .",
    "this means , in fact , that lengths are measured by measuring the time it takes light to traverse them ( and then , converting to distance through this conventional value of  @xmath66  ) .      once a physical parameter has been defined , it is possible to associate to it a particular probability distribution , that will represent , when making a measurement , the absence of information on the possible outcome of the experiment .",
    "assume that , furnished with our definition of the unit of time duration , we wish to measure the period of some object .",
    "it can be the period of a rotating galaxy , or the period of a xvii - th century pendulum , or the period of a vibrating molecule : we do not know yet .",
    "let us denote by  @xmath67   the probability density representing this state of total ignorance .",
    "the frequency  @xmath68  associated to the period  @xmath63  is  @xmath69  .",
    "> from  @xmath67  we can , using the general rule of change of variables , deduce the probability density for the frequency :  @xmath70  .",
    "now , the definition of the unit of time duration is undistinguishable from the definition of the unit of frequency .",
    "in fact , when trying to define the standard of time we said `` when the imposed frequency is such that is causes the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the atoms , the standard of _ frequency _ has been realised '' , which shows how closely related are the reciprocal parameters period - frequency : we can not define the unit _ second _ without defining , at the same time , the unit _",
    "hertz_.    we find here , at a very fundamental level , the class of reciprocal parameters analyzed by harold jeffreys ( [ note : jeffreys ] ) .",
    "as he argued , the null information probability density must have the same form for the two parameters , i.e. ,  @xmath71  and  @xmath72  must be _ the same function_. then , the constraint  @xmath73  , seen above , gives , up to a multiplicative constant , the solution @xmath74    the range of time durations ( or of periods ) considered in physics spans many orders of magnitude ( from periods of atomic objects to cosmological periods ) .",
    "physicists then often use a logarithmic scale , defining , for instance ,  @xmath75   and  @xmath76  , where the two constants  @xmath77  and  @xmath78  can be arbitrary ( [ note : theconstants ] ) . transforming the probability densities in  [ eq : thesol ] to the logarithmic variables",
    "gives  @xmath79   and  @xmath80  .",
    "the logarithmic variables ( that take values on all the real line ) have a constant probability density .",
    "this , is fact , is the deep interpretation of the  @xmath81   probability densities in equations  [ eq : thesol ] .",
    "the particular variables for which the probability density representing the state of null information is a constant over all the space can be named _ cartesian _ : they are more `` natural '' than others , as are the usual cartesian coordinates in euclidean spaces  ( [ note : cartesian ] ) . that these `` cartesian '' variables are not only more natural , but also more practical than other variables , can be understood by considering that manufacturers of pianos space notes with constant increments not of frequency , but of the associated logarithmic variable .",
    "we have seen that the definition of length is today related to that of time duration through the velocity of light .",
    "we could say that the electromagnetic wave of the radiation that defines the unit of time , defines , through its wavelength , the unit of distance .",
    "but , here again , we have a perfect symmetry between the wavelength and its inverse , the wavenumber .",
    "this is why we take the function  @xmath82   to describe the null information probability density for the length of an object ( [ note : amusing ] ) .      to define the experimental procedure that will lead to a `` measurement '' we need to conceptualize the objects of the `` universe ''",
    ": do we have point particles or a continuous medium ?",
    "any instrument that we can build will have finite accuracy , as any manufacture is imperfect .",
    "also , during the measurement act , the instrument will always be submitted to unwanted sollicitations ( like uncontrolled vibrations ) .",
    "this is why , even if the experimenter postulates the existence of a well defined , `` true value '' , of the measured parameter , she / he will never be able to measure it exactly .",
    "careful modeling of experimental uncertainties is not easy , sometimes , the result of a measurement of a parameter  @xmath83   is presented as  @xmath84  , where the interpretation of  @xmath85  may be diverse . for instance",
    ", the experimenter may imagine a bell - shaped probability density around  @xmath86  representing her / his state of information `` on the true value of the parameter '' .",
    "the constant  @xmath85  can be the standard deviation ( or mean deviation , or other estimator of dispersion ) of the probability density used to model the experimental uncertainty .    in part",
    ", the shape of this probability density may come from histograms of observed or expected fluctuations . in part , it will come from a subjective estimation of the defects of the unique pieces of the instrument .",
    "we postulate here that the result of any measurement can , in all generality , be described by defining a probability density over the measured parameter , representing the information brought by the experiment on the `` true '' , unknowable , value of the parameter . the official guidelines for expressing uncertainty in measurement , as given by the international organization for standardization ( iso ) and the national institute of standards and technology ( [ note : iso ] )",
    "although stressing the special notion of standard deviation , are consistent with the possible use of general probability distributions to express the result of a measurement , as advocated here .",
    "any shape of the density function is not acceptable .",
    "for instance , the use of a gaussian density to represent the result of a measurement of a positive quantity ( like an electric resistivity ) would give a finite probability for negative values of the variable , which is inconsistent ( a lognormal probability density , on the contrary , could be acceptable ) .",
    "in the event of an `` infinitely bad measurement '' ( like when , for instance , an unexpected event prevents , in fact , any meaningful measure ) the result of the measurement should be described using the null information probability density introduced above .",
    "in fact , when the density function used to represent the result of a mesurement has a parameter  @xmath85  describing the `` width '' of the function , it is the limit of the density function for  @xmath87  that should represent a measurement of infinitely bad quality .",
    "this is consistent , for instance , with the use of a lognormal probability density for a parameter like an electric resisitivity  @xmath88  , as the limit of the lognormal for  @xmath87  is the  @xmath89  function , which is the right choice of noninformative probability density for  @xmath88  .",
    "another example of possible probability density to represent the result of a measurement of a parameter  @xmath83   is to take the noninformative probability density for  @xmath90  and zero outside .",
    "this fixes strict bounds for possible values of the parameter , and tends to the noninformative probability density when the bounds tend to infinity .",
    "the point of view proposed here will be consistent with the the use of `` theoretical parameter correlations '' as proposed in section [ sec : usingbayestheory ] , so that there is no difference , from our point of view , between a `` simple measurement '' and a measurement using physical theories , including , perhaps , sophisticated inverse methods .",
    "physical `` laws '' prevent us from setting arbitrarily some physical parameters . for instance",
    ", we can set the length of a tube where a free fall experiment will be performed , and we can also decide on the place and time of the experiment , but the time duration of the free fall is `` imposed by nature '' .",
    "physics in much about the analysis of these physical correlations between parameters .    typically , a set  @xmath91  of _ independent parameters _ is identified , and experiments are performed in order to measure the values of a set  @xmath92  of _ dependent parameters _ ( [ note : freewill ] ) .",
    "analytical physical theories try then to express the result of the observations by a functional relationship  @xmath93  .",
    "in fact , saying that the independent parameters are `` set '' and the dependent parameters `` measured '' is an oversimplification , as all the parameters must be measured . and , as discussed in the previous section , uncertainties are present in every measurement .",
    "the values of the parameters that are set ( the independent parameters ) are never known exactly .",
    "the measures of the dependent parameters have always uncertainties attached .",
    "assume we have made a large number of experiments , that show how the dependent parameters correlate with the independent ones . within the error bars of the experimental results it will always be possible to fit an infinity of functional relationships of the form  @xmath93  .",
    "adding more experimental points may help to discard some of the `` theories '' , but there will always remain an infinity of them .",
    "we formalize this fact at a fundamental level , by replacing the need of a functional relationship by the use of a probability distribution in the space of all the parameters considered , representing the actual information we may have .",
    "not only this point of view corresponds to a certain philosophy of physics , it also leads as discussed below to the only consistent formalism we know that is able to predict values of possible observations and of the attached uncertainties .    to be complete ,",
    "we consider two cases where we may wish to analyze the physical correlations between parameters .",
    "the first case is when a repetitive phenomenon takes place spontaneously .",
    "the second case correspond to the case when an experimenter prompts a physical phenomenon , using an experimental arrangement .",
    "consider an astronomer trying to analyze the `` relationship '' between the initial magnitude  @xmath94  of shooting stars and the total distance  @xmath95  traveled by the meteors on the sky before disintegration .",
    "each shooting star naturally appearing on the sky will allow one measurement of the two parameters  @xmath94  and  @xmath95   to be performed ( and possibly other significant parameters ) . as discussed above , each result of a measurement",

    "this is , for instance , the way absolute gravimeters work , deducing , from the time  @xmath63  , the local value of the acceleration of gravity  @xmath112  ; we will later face the alternative possibility ) , the experimenter should receive tubes of different lengths  @xmath114  randomly generated according to the null information probability density for the length of an object , i.e. , with the probability density  @xmath115  .",
    "when the first tube is provided to him , the experimenter should perform the falling experiment and , using the best possible equipment , measure as accurately as possible the length  @xmath62  of the tube given to him and the time  @xmath63  it takes to the falling body to make the distance .",

    "when a second tube , with random length , is provided to him , he should perform again the experiment and obtain a second probability density  @xmath117  . as already explained ,",
    "the `` bayesian theory '' corresponding to these experiments is then the union ( in the sense defined above ) of all the states of information obtained in all the individual experiments , when their number tends to infinity : @xmath118 figure  [ fig : magnification ] schematizes the sort of probability density such a method would produce ( [ note : lognotheo ] ) .",
    "10 cm    we have explored the case where the length  @xmath62  of the tube is first set and , then , the falling experiment is performed , measuring the time  @xmath63  .",
    "the alternative is to fix the time duration  @xmath63  first and , then , to perform the the falling experiment , measuring the length  @xmath62   the falling body has traveled in that time .",
    "the two sorts of experiments are not identical , as the type of measurements performed will be different and will lead to different uncertainties . in this case ,",
    "the experimenter is provided with time durations  @xmath119  randomly selected according to the null information probability density for the period of a process , and obtains probability densities  @xmath120 representing the results of the measurements .",
    "the union of all these states of information @xmath121 would provide the `` bayesian theory '' corresponding to that sort of experiment .",
    "there is no reason for the two `` bayesian theories '' thus obtained to be identical , as they correspond to a different type of experiment .",
    "we are then faced with the conclusion that the replacement of an analytical equation by a probability density will lead to probability densities attached to the precise experiment being performed .",
    "in fact , this is not so different to what would have been obtained when seeking for a functional relationship , as the `` best fitting curve '' for the first kind of experiments may not be the `` best fitting '' one for the second kind of experiments .",
    "the formation of a `` bayesian theory '' here made by summing small distributions ( `` histogramming '' ) can be understood in two ways .",
    "first , we could perfectly well proceed in this way in practice , performing systematic measurements of parameter correlations , using the best avalilable equipment .",
    "alternatively , we can understand the proposed method as a thought experiment helping to clarify what `` theoretical uncertainties '' can be .",
    "these uncertainties can then be modeled using standard distributions ( gaussian , double exponential  ) in such a way that usable but still realistic probability distributions in the parameter space can be defined and used as `` bayesian theories '' , as in the example shown in note ( [ note : lognotheo ] ) .",
    "we will conclude this section with two remarks .",
    "first , it is not possible to sample a probability distribution that can not be normalized , as it is usually the case for the noninformative probabilities , like , for positive  @xmath55  , the  @xmath81  distribution .",
    "then , practical lower and upper bounds have to be used .",
    "second , the number of experimental `` points '' that have to be used in order to have a good practical approximation of a `` bayesian theory '' depends on the accuracy of the measurements .",
    "enough experiments have to be done so that the sum in equations  [ eq : aratheo-1 ] and  [ eq : aratheo-2 ] is smooth enough .",
    "the sharper the experimental design , the more experiments we will need ( and the mode detail we will have ) .      assume that enough experiments have been made , by skilled people , using the best available equipment , following the guidelines of the previous section , so that the `` bayesian theory ''  @xmath122  is available .",
    "now a new tube is given to us , whose length has been randomly generated according to the null information probability density ,  @xmath115  .",
    "we perform the falling experiment , perhaps with a more modest equipment than that used to obtain the bayesian theory , and measure the two parameters  @xmath62  and  @xmath63  , the result of the measurement being described by the state of information  @xmath123  .",
    "how can we combine this information with the bayesian theory , so that we can ameliorate our knowledge on  @xmath62  and  @xmath63  ?",
    "we are exactly here in the situation where the notion of conditional probability ( in fact , our generalization of it ) applies : we know that we have a realization in the  @xmath124  space generated according to the theoretical probability density  @xmath122   and we have a state of information on this particular realization that is described by the probability density  @xmath123  .",
    "the resulting state of information is then that obtained by applying the  operation to these two states of information ( i.e. , in the language defined above , by taking their intersection ) .",
    "this gives @xmath125 in general , if  @xmath91  is the independent parameter set and  @xmath92  the dependent set , @xmath126    if the information content concerning  @xmath62  contained in  @xmath123  is very high ( the length of the tube is well known ) while the information on  @xmath63  is low , then ,  @xmath127  will essentially ameliorate our information on  @xmath63  .",
    "this corresponds to the solution of a classical prediction problem in physics ( how long it will take for a stone to fall from the top of the tower of pisa ? ) .",
    "reciprocally , if the information content concerning  @xmath63  contained in  @xmath123  is very high ( the time of the fall is well known ) while the information on the length of the tube is low , then ,  @xmath127  will essentially ameliorate our information on  @xmath62  .",
    "then , equation  [ eq : invbofill ] corresponds to the solution of an `` inverse problem '' , where `` data '' is used to infer the values of the parameters describing some system .",
    "this use of the notion of intersection of states of information to solve inverse problems was advocated by tarantola and valette ( [ note : tarantolaandvalette ] ) and tarantola ( [ note : tarantola ] ) , who showed that this method leads to results consistent with more particular techniques ( like least squares of least absolute values ) when some of the subtleties are ignored ( theoretical uncertainties neglected , etc . ) .",
    "we do not know of any alternative to our approach that solves consistently nonlinear inverse problems .",
    "introducing kolmogorov s definition of probability distributions without introducing the two operations  and , is like introducing the real numbers without introducing the sum and the product : we may compute , replacing clear mathematical objects by intuitive operations , but we are lacking an important structure of the space .",
    "the two operations we have introduced satisfy so obvious axioms that is difficult to imagine a simpler structure .",
    "this structure may be used for many different inference problems , but we have chosen here an illustration in the realm of physics .",
    "we have replaced the notion of an analytical theory by the bayesian notion of a probablity density representing all the experimentally obtained correlations between physical parameters , the space of independent parameters being visited randomly according to their null information probability density .",
    "practically , some regions of the parameter space will not be accessible to investigation .",
    "accordingly , the `` result '' of the measurement will be the null information probability density for the corresponding parameters . in other words , the `` error bars '' of a `` bayesian theory '' may be large  or even infinite  for some regions of the parameter space .",
    "this is the typical domain where classical , analytical , theories extrapolate the equations that fit the observations made in a restricted region of the parameter space .",
    "no such extrapolation is allowed with our approach .",
    "although we have only shown a simple example ( the galilean experiment ) , the methodology has a large domain of application . as a further example ,",
    "concerning tensor quantities , we could examine the dependence between stress and strain for a given medium .",
    "this would involve : i ) mathematical definition of strain from displacement ; ii ) operational definition of stress ; and iii ) analysis of the stress - strain correlation using the method described in this article .",
    "analytical theories , when extrapolating , predict results that may not correspond to observations , when they are made .",
    "the theory is then `` falsified '' in the sense of popper , and has to be corrected .",
    "a `` bayesian theory '' can be indefinitely refined , as larger domains of the parameter space are accessible to experimentation , but never falsified .",
    "the present work shows that pure empiricism ( as opposed to the mathematical rationalism of analytical theories ) can be mathematically formalised .",
    "this formalism is the only one known by the authors that handles uncertainties consistently .    if physicists enjoy the game of extrapolation ( as , for instance , when pushing einstein s gravity theory to the conditions prevailing in a big bang model of the universe ) , engineers advance by performing experiments as close as possible to the conditions that will prevail `` in the real thing '' .    using the approach here proposed",
    ", the `` = '' sign is only used for mathematical definitions , as , for instance , when _ defining _ a frequency from a period  @xmath69  , or when using the mathematics associated to probability calculus .",
    "but the `` = '' sign is never used to describle physical correlations , that are , by nature , only approximate .",
    "these physical correlations are described by probability distributions .",
    "some may see the systematic use of the `` = '' sign in mathematical physics as a misuse of mathematical concepts .",
