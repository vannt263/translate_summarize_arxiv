    "thermal photons emitted from the hot fireball created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is a promising tool for providing a signature of quark - gluon plasma @xcite ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "since they participate only in electromagnetic interactions , they have a larger mean free path compared to the transverse size of the hot and dense matter created in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "therefore these photons were proposed to verify the existence of the qgp phase @xcite .",
    "spectra of thermal photons depend upon the fireball temperature and they can be calculated from the scattering cross - section of the processes like @xmath1 , _ bremsstrahlung _ etc .",
    "time evolution of the temperature can be calculated using hydrodynamics with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "thus the spectra depend upon the equation of state ( eos ) of the medium and they may be useful in finding a signature of the quark - gluon plasma@xcite .",
    "recently the thermal photons are proposed as a tool to measure the shear viscosity of the strongly interacting matter produced in the collisions@xcite .",
    "understanding shear viscosity of qgp is one of the most intriguing aspects of the experiments at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "analysis of the experimental data collected from rhic show that the strongly coupled matter produced in the collisions is not too much above the phase transition temperature @xmath2 and it may have extremely small value of shear viscosity @xmath3 .",
    "in fact the ratio of the shear viscosity @xmath3 to the entropy density @xmath4 i.e. @xmath5 is around @xmath6 which is the smallest for any known liquid in the nature@xcite .",
    "in fact the arguments based on ads - cft suggest that the values of @xmath5 can not become lower than @xmath6 .",
    "this is now known as kovtun - son - starinets or kss- bound @xcite .",
    "thus the quark - gluon plasma produced in rhic experiments is believed to be in a form of the most perfect liquid@xcite .",
    "no wonder ideal hydrodynamic appears to be best description of such matter as suggested by comparison between the experimental data@xcite and the calculations done using second - order relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "however there remains uncertainties in understanding the application and validity of the hydrodynamical procedure in the relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "it is only very recently realized that the effect of bulk viscosity can bring complications in the hydrodynamical description of the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "generally it was believed that the bulk viscosity does not play a significant role in the hydrodynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it was argued that that since @xmath7 scaled like @xmath8 at very high energy the bulk viscosity may not play a significant role because the matter might be following the ideal gas type equation of state@xcite .",
    "but during its course of expansion the fireball temperature can approach values close to @xmath2 .",
    "recent lattice qcd results may not have ideal gas eos and the ratio @xmath9 show a strong peak around @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity contribution in this regime can be much larger than that of the the shear viscosity .",
    "recently the role of bulk viscosity in heating and expansion of the fireball was analyzed using one dimensional hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "another complication that bulk viscosity brings in hydrodynamics of heavy - ion collisions is phenomenon of cavitation@xcite .",
    "cavitation arises when the fluid pressure becomes smaller than the vapour pressure . since the bulk viscosity ( and also shear viscosity ) contributes to the pressure gradient with a negative contribution , it may be possible for the effective fluid pressure to become zero . once the cavitation sets in the hydrodynamical description breaks down .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that cavitation may happen in rhic experiments when the effect of bulk viscosity is included in manner consistent with the lattice results .",
    "it was shown that the cavitation may significantly reduce the time of hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "one of the main objectives of this paper is to study the photon spectra with the effect of bulk viscosity and cavitation .",
    "finite @xmath7 effect can either significantly reduce the time for the hydrodynamical evolution ( by onset of cavitation ) or it can increase the time by which the system reaches @xmath2 ! moreover the _ non - ideal _ gas eos can also significantly influence the hydrodynamics ( see below ) . in",
    "what follows , we use equations of relativistic second order hydrodynamics to incorporate the effects of finite viscosity .",
    "we take the value of @xmath9 same as that in ref.@xcite and keep @xmath10 .",
    "further we use one dimensional boost invariant hydrodynamics in the same spirit as in refs.@xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of this approach is that the effects of transverse flow can not be incorporated .",
    "as the boost - invariant hydrodynamics is known to lead to underestimation of the effects of bulk viscosity@xcite , we believe that our study of the photon spectra will provide a conservative estimate of the effect .",
    "we represent the energy momentum tensor of the dissipative qgp formed in high energy nuclear collisions as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the energy density , pressure and four velocity of the fluid element respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath15 acts as a projection perpendicular to four velocity .",
    "the viscous contributions to @xmath16 are represented by @xmath17 where @xmath18 , the traceless part of @xmath19 ; gives the contribution of shear viscosity and @xmath20 gives the bulk contribution .",
