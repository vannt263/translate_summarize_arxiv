    "geometrically frustrated interactions and quantum effect often lead to exotic orders such as , quantum spin ice on a pyrochlore lattice,@xcite spin liquid state on kagom lattice@xcite and fractionalized magnetization plateaux,@xcite because strong fluctuations suppress stabilization of classical or trivial magnetic orderings . a shastry - sutherland lattice ( ssl)@xcite is one of such frustrated systems and the hamiltonian of the ssl model",
    "can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for intra - dimer and inter - dimer site - pairs on the ssl as shown in fig .",
    "[ mera - structure ] , panel ( d ) .",
    "srcu@xmath10(bo@xmath11)@xmath10 has provided a good stage for studying the magnetic properties of the ssl model.@xcite the crystal structure of this compound is characterized by a layered structure of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ions carry @xmath14 spins.@xcite from magnetic susceptibility measurements,@xcite it has been reported that the ground state is spin gapped and the coupling ratio is estimated as @xmath15.@xcite this compound shows anomalous properties in magnetic fields owing to the magnetic frustration ; the magnetization curve exhibits a multi - steps structure .",
    "in addition to the plateaux with magnetization at @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath5 of the saturation value,@xcite recent torque experiments suggested existence of @xmath18 and other plateaux with more exotic fraction numbers.@xcite    quite recently , rare - earth compounds@xcite with the ssl structure were also studied in experiments , showing exciting magnetic properties may or may not differ from the original material srcu@xmath10(bo@xmath11)@xmath10 .",
    "while the inter - dimer and intra - dimer interaction strength differs from material to material and long range interactions can be crucial to understand magnetic properties in the rare - earth compound cases , the ssl model with frustrated heisenberg interactions is still the key point to understand the physics of magnetic properties of these materials .",
    "theoretically , the ground - state phase diagram of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has also been in debate for this decade .",
    "the remarkable feature is that , in the limit @xmath19 , the direct product state of singlets on @xmath20 bonds becomes the eigen state and the energy of this orthogonal dimer ( od ) state can be given exactly by @xmath21 .",
    "oppositely , the system becomes equivalent to the antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model on a square lattice in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "thus the conventional af state is realized with a gapless dispersion .",
    "this fact leads to naive expectation that a quantum phase transition between these two phases take place when @xmath23 is changed .",
    "although the quantum phase transition including the possibility of intermediate phase has been intensively studied by analytical and numerical approaches,@xcite conclusive result has not been established yet .",
    "in fact , obtained results strongly depend on approaches . more specifically , the high - temperature - series expansion , early exact diagonalization and peps@xcite suggested the direct transition from the od phase to the af phase . in contrast ,",
    "schwinger boson meanfield theory suggested the existence of helical ordered state as an intermediate phase.@xcite koga and kawakami predicted that the other spin gapped phase exists for @xmath24.@xcite and it can be expressed by the alignment of resonating singlet dimers on the plaquette without @xmath25 bond , namely plaquette singlets .",
    "this prediction was supported by the other numerical exact diagonalization study on up - to 32-site systems.@xcite more fascinating possibility was predicted from the results of dimer - field theory in ref .  ; weakly incommensurate spin - density wave state is stabilized in the intermediate phase . the modified cluster expansion with self - consistent perturbation by hajj and malrieu suggested that the lowest energy state is either plaquette singlet or columnar dimer states.@xcite the reason of the above long historical discussions on the intermediate region is caused by the fact that quantum fluctuation leads to numerous candidate states , all of which have similar energies .",
    "therefore one may hope unbiased calculations such as quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) . since qmc calculation , which is very helpful to settle problems if possible , suffers from the negative sign problem in the present case",
    ", this approach will be excluded .",
    "similar situation is also seen in magnetic properties when external field @xmath26 exists : multi - plateau physics .",
    "exact diagonalizations@xcite and other pioneer studies@xcite have established the existence of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath17 plateaux , while details of the small magnetization region were not very clear . in a recent paper by sebastian _",
    "et al._,@xcite the possibility of fractional magnetic plateaux at @xmath27 ( @xmath28 = integer ) was discussed in analogy to the quantum hall effect .",
    "several authors predicted many possible plateaux with further exotic fraction numbers like such as @xmath29 and @xmath30.@xcite they focused on the strong dimer limit @xmath31 case , and inter - dimer interactions @xmath20 were treated as perturbations.@xcite in such case , triplet excitations induced by external magnetic fields can be regarded as hardcore bosons and the interactions on plaquette without @xmath25 bonds can be considered as a combination of repulsion interaction and hopping process.@xcite although many believes that these plateaux shall persist in the large coupling ratio ( @xmath6 ) region , up to best of our knowledge , no unbiased numerical method has thoroughly confirmed the result in such situations .",
    "what is more interesting is the proposal of possible supersolid phases which may appear in the presence of large external field.@xcite the supersolid phases have been confirmed in various 1d and 2d frustrated models,@xcite and it has been well established that correlated hopping ( bosons hop when another boson is present as its neighbor ) plays an important role,@xcite since single boson hopping is strongly suppressed by frustration in the ssl model . due to the strong competition between repulsion and hopping terms ,",
    "supersolid phases are unlikely to emerge as the ground state at small coupling ratio region ( @xmath32 ) . as a result",
    ", supersolidty has not been well investigated in early calculations which treat @xmath20 as simple perturbation.@xcite    in this paper , we study the magnetic properties of the ssl model , using variational method based on the entanglement renormailzation ( er ) ansatz .",
    "this method is more popularly known as `` multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz '' , or simply mera , which is proposed by vidal a few years ago.@xcite it is a promising numerical method based on merging the idea of tensor product state ansatz and renormalization group theory .",
    "the key feature of mera is the introduction of so called `` disentanglers '' which targets on reducing local correlations , so that long range entanglement can be captures with limited computational cost at a coarse grained level . in our er based calculation",
    "however , we simply use one level of coarse graining , instead of multiple levels in mera calculations .",
    "we employ multiple neighboring unitcells in neighborhood of the unitcell we calculate , to study thermodynamic properties with meanfield approximation . this method",
    "is also proposed by evenbly and vidal under the name `` finite range mera '' ( frmera),@xcite due to the fact that only entanglement within finite range up to the size of each unticell is well captured .",
    "we will discuss details of frmera and justify the reason we use this method in our er calculation .",
    "we want to highlight that unlike previous studies mentioned above , _ our calculation does not enforce any bias to the original hamiltonian_. the ground state is obtained from pure variational calculations , as the state with lowest energy for the input hamiltonian ( _ i.e. _ , we provide upper boundary for the ground state energy . ) our calculation focuses on the relatively large coupling ratio region , which has not been well investigated , since we are not limited to the small coupling ratio limit @xmath31 .    in the absence of magnetic field , we find strong evidence of the existence of the plaquette valence bond solid ( vbs ) phase in the intermediate coupling ratio region above the first phase transition point @xmath0 .",
    "when the external field is turned on , we confirm the all the major ( well accepted ) plateaux such as @xmath17 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 , as well as minor ones including @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath29 .",
    "we also observe a strong evidence of several supersolid orders above @xmath5 and @xmath4 plateaux , as proposed by momoi _",
    "et al._,@xcite which has not been discussed in previous numerical studies to best of our knowledge .",
    "our results show that the @xmath5 plateau only appears above @xmath33 , and the @xmath4 plateau and its corresponding supersolid phase persist until the largest coupling ratio @xmath34 before the phase transition to the plaquette order .",

    "neighboring unitcells ( shadow regions ) are used as meanfield environment to simulate system in the thermodynamic limit @xmath36 .",
    "+ panel ( d ) : unitcells consist of @xmath37 spins , or equivalently 4 coarse grained sites .",
    "this unitcell is specially chosed to perserve the x - y symmetry of the square lattice .",
    ", width=283 ]    the structure of tensor network plays an important role in er calculations .",
    "although there are no strict rules for constructing er tensor network for a specific model , one guideline shall be taken into consideration .",
    "the advantage of er based method comes from the _ disentangler _ tensors , which reduce local correlations so that the density matrix of the coarse grained ( cg ) system is capable of capturing long range entanglement of the original spin model with relatively small virtual dimensions @xmath38 .",
    "naturally , _ all interactions across boundary of the coarse graining domain should be treated by disentangler tensors_. relatively speaking , in most frustrated two dimensional quantum spin systems , it is common to have more interactions involved with each site , compared to non - frustration spin models . as a result",
    "it is important to design an er tensor network suitable for the ssl model that we are interested in .    in fig .",
    "[ mera - structure ] , we show an illustration of the er tensor network structure we chose for this calculation . notice that the network is constructed on the square lattice s geometry , instead of the ssl s .",
    "we believe that it does not affect the result much in the small coupling ratio limit , as the ground state can be considers as decoupled dimers separated on the lattice .",
    "moreover , such a choice may aid us in the large coupling ratio region where we are most interested in .",
    "this geometry allows us to easily utilize our tensor structure to study other frustrated lattice which can be mapped onto square lattice ( _ i.e. _ , the checker - board model ) .",
    "overall , 8 sites on the original square lattice are coarse grained into one site on the renormalized lattice , which is another square lattice tilted by @xmath39 .",
    "coarse - graining sites obtained from isometry tensors and the corresponding domain containing the 8 original spins are shown as blue circles and shadowed regions , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ mera - structure ] , panel ( a ) .",
    "two layers of 4-sites disentanglers ( colored by red and green ) are applied consecutively on the boundary of coarse - graining domains , before the isometry tensors are applied .",
    "overlook the tensor network on top of the ssl , it is clear that all intra and inter dimer interactions are covered by at least one tensor of the network . as a result , all interactions across the boundary of cg domains are treated by disentanglers .",
    "the coarse grained lattice is then described by an top density matrix . obviously , the dimension of the coarse - grained spin @xmath38 and the number of cg spins covered by the density matrix determine computational cost of our calculation . in practice , we are able to treat up to 6 coarse grained sites ( @xmath37 spins ) per unitcell .    as mentioned previously , unlike the mera method , we only apply one level of renormalization to the ssl in our calculation . instead of limiting ourselves to finite - size systems with periodic boundary conditions , we choose frmera to construct multiple identical neighboring unitcells . in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ mera - structure ] , we illustrate an example when the unitcell contains @xmath40 spins ( shadowed region in the background ) . in such a case , the density matrix of each unitcell ( represented by light triangles in fig .  [ mera - structure ] ) is not correlated to its neighbors at all . as a result",
    ", the frmera method is obviously related to the meanfield approximation in the way how we simulate system in thermodynamic limit .",
    "the reason we choose frmera instead of the ordinary mera is twofold .",
    "first , although applying multiple levels of renormailzation can significantly increase the system size we can study in mera , associated cost is very high .",
    "this is due to the fact that sufficiently large virtual dimensions @xmath38 is required for each site in the coarse grained system in order to capture sufficient long range entanglement in higher level of renormalization .",
    "moreover , we are not specially focusing on quantum critical region whereas scale - invariant physics play an important role ( where multi - level renormailzation is important and meaningful ) .",
    "rather , we pay special attentions to the ground state of ssl model with and without presence of external magnetic field .",
    "in such a case , as long as the unitcell is large enough to accommodate candidate ground states and its associated entanglement , we can simply use er with meanfield approximation which is significantly cheaper in computational cost compared with mera .    as a matter of fact",
    ", frmera turns out to be beneficial in studying the magnetic properties of ssl model .",
    "the ssl model shows intriguing magnetic properties in response to external magnetic field @xmath26 .",
    "besides @xmath41 and @xmath16 magnetic plateaux observed in early experiments , there are theoretical studies as well as possible signature from experiment supporting existence from plateaux with small fraction numbers , such as @xmath18 , @xmath29 and @xmath30.@xcite one difficulty to study these magnetic plateaux computationally lies in the fact that they only appear as ground states if the unitcell itself is compatible with the fraction number . for example , plateaux with fraction number @xmath5 , @xmath18 and so on can not be well described in er calculations performed on @xmath37 unitcell , nor can it be even with multiple renormalization applied ( due to periodicity ) . obviously , it is increasingly difficult to capture plateaux with even smaller fraction numbers , which require larger unitcells to settle in .",
    "the frmera method offers a semi - solution to this problem .",
    "namely , one can further sort unitcells into different categories , each contains a different set of tensors . following this",
    ", we can effectively create a larger super - unitcell , which combines one unitcell per category , at a computational cost linear to the size ( number of unitcells included ) .",
    "we show such super - unitcells as background in fig .",
    "[ pattern ] .",
    "notice that unitcells shown in different colors belong to different categories . as one example , in the last panel ,",
    "the super - unitcell is considered as a combination of 3 unitcells , one per each color , so that the er calculation is capable to capture the @xmath29 plateau .",
    "it is worth mentioning that unitcells included in the super - unitcell do not have correlations with each other _ at top level _ , since it is just a product state like a meanfield approximation . on the other hand",
    ", correlations can still pass through in lower level tensor network , so that we are still able to study plateaux with small fraction numbers which would be impossible to find in ordinary unitcell , or naively increase number of renormalization steps .",
    "the dimension of coarse grained virtual spin , @xmath38 , affects our calculation results . for unitcells",

    "the debate is mainly focused on the intermediate region where quantum fluctuations are large and sign - problem due to frustration of ssl model prohibits effective numerical methods for quantum magnets to be performed . in fig .

    "[ ground - state ] .",

    "[ ground - state ] .",
    "the bond energy profile also strongly indicates that the ground state in the intermediate region does not break @xmath60 rotational symmetry .",
    "results of frmera calculation are dependent to the size of unitcell we use . in fig .",
    "[ ground - state ] , we show two sets of data which correspond to calculations based on two types of unitcells sized @xmath45 and @xmath37 .",
    "the dimer order parameter @xmath44 increases when the unitcell is enlarged .",
    "the @xmath45 unitcell clearly breaks the rotational symmetry of the original model , whereas the fan - shaped @xmath37 unitcell does not ( both shown in fig .",
    "[ mera - structure ] ) . as a result , in the intermediate region just above @xmath61",
    ", @xmath62 remains small but finite in @xmath45 unitcells calculations , but turns out to be @xmath63 in the @xmath37 sized unitcells case .",
    "we conclude that plaquette vbs state , which preserve @xmath60 rotational symmetry of the square lattice , emerges as the ground state when the system undergoes a phase transition out of the od order .",
    "in contrast to the phase transition point between the od phase and plaquette vbs phase , the transition between the af order and plaquette vbs phase seems not to be clear due to finite size effect of our unitcell .",
    "the value of @xmath44 drastically decreases around @xmath64 and @xmath46 starts to develops inversely .",
    "however , the crossing point of two order parameters is shifting to higher @xmath23 value , when the size of the unitcell is increased .",
    "in fact , order parameters are slightly affected by dimension @xmath38 ( _ i.e. _ , not fully converged ) for @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , both order parameters remain finite in a relatively large region near the transition point . as a result , solely based on available result",
    ", we can not clearly determine the nature of the phase transition between the plaquette vbs order and the af order .",
    "further calculation is required for precise discussion of the phase transition point .",
    "it is necessary to discuss the validity of the ground state we obtained from er calculation .",
    "first , it is natural to expect that mera and er methods are biased _ in the sense that the tensor network ( including the way we choose coarse grained lattice ) has a spacial structure_. actually , the er ( and mera ) procedure probably breaks spacial ( translational and rotational ) symmetries inhering in the original hamiltonian . as a result , optimized wave functions of the ground state may contain unwanted effective perturbation introduced from the tensor structure .",
    "naturally , if the dimension @xmath38 of coarse grained system is sufficiently large , the effect of such bias can be neglected , and the solution of the er calculation becomes exact . in practice , @xmath38 used in our calculation is limited , to avoid explosion of simulation cost .",
    "such limited @xmath38 will cause severe problem to determine the nature of the ground state in the critical region , or to locate the phase transition point , where the gap between energies of different candidate orders are closing .",
    "what we can do is to reduce such bias by choosing an er tensor structure that is compatible to most candidates of ground states . for the present case ,",
    "we specifically chosen a tensor network structure with even periodicity ( @xmath66 , the coarse graining bulk contains 8 sites ) as discussed in the previous section , because the plaquette vbs state ( 4 site per unit cell ) is one of the candidate ground states at a zero field .",
    "apparently , the network adopted has suitable structure for the wave function of most candidates , namely the af state , the od state , and the vbs state .",
    "unfortunately the er structure we use has difficulties dealing with incommensurate spin density wave ( sdw ) state , as common for most numerical method based on a finite unitcell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "if we can apply mutiple - level ers on the ssl , the incommensurate sdw state may be captured approximately as in ref .  .",
    "however , due to very high computational cost , it is difficult in our er . to summarize , we believe that our result is not much affected by the bias introduced from tensor network structure away from the critical region , although we can not rule out the possibility of the incommensurate sdw phase .    secondly , the er calculation we performed is essentially a variational approach .",
    "a well known feature of variational calculation is that optimization may converge into local minimums , instead of the global minimum - the true ground state . in terms of energy landscape ,",
    "the od phase and the plaquette phase ( which is fourfold degenerate on the square lattice ) correspond to far separated , sharp and stable local minimums . in other word , near the critical region",
    ", optimization calculations may end in both candidate states with finite possibilities , and it is impossible to  tunnel  between two different phases whence the optimization has reached the local minimum .",
    "hence , this is also a strong indication that the phase transition between the od order and the plaquette vbs order is of first order .",
    "a jump in order parameters and a sudden change of slope in energy can be observed in fig .",
    "[ ground - state ] .",
    "in contrast , in the critical region between the vbs and af phase , the two local minimums corresponding to the respective phases are shallow , not well separated and show tendency of merging with each other at the critical point .",
    "therefore the slope of energy does not change drastically , while @xmath44 and @xmath46 evolve smoothly across the phase boundary .",
    "this is an indication of a second order phase transition , but we can not rule out the possibility of cross over because of the severe finite - size dependence .",
    "what makes the ssl model and its realization srcu@xmath10(bo@xmath11)@xmath10 fascinating is its magnetic property in a magnetic field .",
    "it is well known from experiments that the coupling ratio is @xmath67 , where the ground state is given to be od state ( product of singlets ) . in the presence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "polarized triplets with @xmath68 are created , which can be treated as hardcore bosons moving on the effective square lattice . due to strong frustration in the lattice , single triple hopping is strongly suppressed , and effective repulsion between triplets governs the physics in the system when the coupling ratio satisfies @xmath32 .",
    "naturally , magnetic excitations form long range order and then , the system is in a magnetic plateau : an incompressible mott phase .    pioneer theoretical works confirmed several magnetic plateaux . among them , @xmath5 and @xmath4 are most well accepted , while plateaux in lower magnetization are still less clear .",

    "it is worth mentioning that the 1/8 plateau appears only around @xmath33 and the local moment distribution @xmath76 is of the so called rhomboid type , although the energy difference between rhomboid type and square type is extremely small . for @xmath77 , we find that the 1/8 plateau state ( rhomboid type configuration ) has higher energy compared with other plateaux",
    ". this discrepancy may arise from further long - range interactions .",
    "another interesting point is that the 2/9 plateau state , proposed in ref .  , which can be covered by our super - unitcell tensor network wave function ( and emerge as local minima in our variational calculation ) , turns out to be worse in energy compared to other low magnetization plateau states ( 1/4,1/6 ) in relevant parameter region .",
    "this fact indicates that the pcut treatment @xcite seems to be already broken down for @xmath6 .",
    "again here we discuss the validity of our variational ground states .",
    "it is obvious that plateau states with different fraction number correspond to local minimums , in terms of energy landscape in our calculation . in the presence of relatively large external field .",
    "( @xmath66 , @xmath78 , while @xmath79 in the saturation magnetization ) , we find there are two major groups of local minimums : one corresponds @xmath4 plateau and the other is @xmath5 .",
    "these two local minimums are stable , sharp and far separated , which means tunneling from one plateau state to another is nearly impossible to happen , especially at the later part of the optimization .",
    "the reason is simply that these two plateau states are characterized by different periodicity .",
    "we use the existence of stable local minimums to our advantage .",
    "we can obtain energy of a certain plateau state as a monotonic function of field @xmath26 , if we choose to load tensors from previous calculations ( that is know to host the plateau state ) instead of starting from random initial condition .",
    "phase boundaries are then determined by the crossing point of energy curves of different plateau states , as shown in inset fig .",
    "[ magnetic - plateaux ] .",
    "each crossing point corresponds to a jump in the magnetic curve , which is a strong first - order phase transition .",
    "similar techniques were also used in other variational method as well.@xcite however , in lower magnetizations ( @xmath80 ) , the energy gap between different plateau states are fairly close and the phase boundaries between different plateau states are less clear , because the energy for each plateau state is sensitive to changing of unitcell geometry and other factors .",
    "it is also necessary to point out that the dimension @xmath38 of the coarse grained system in our calculation has very limited impact on results of magnetic plateaux .",

    "the geometry of crystalline pattern of the triplets plays an important role in the correlated hopping process , as pointed out by several studies.@xcite more specifically , for both @xmath5 and @xmath4 plateau states , triplet excitations ( and the remaining singlet dimers ) form stripes in @xmath96 direction of the ssl , which corresponds to horizontal and vertical lines in our illustrations ( fig .",

    "the main reason for the shrinking of @xmath4 plateau has been revealed in previous studies : the strength of the nearest neighbor repulsion between dimers significantly reduces in large @xmath23 region .",
    "it is however not clear whether the @xmath4 plateau shall remain in the compound srcu@xmath10(bo@xmath11)@xmath10 ( with @xmath101 ) , or materials with even larger coupling ratios . according to our er calculation",

    "secondly , the @xmath5 supersolid phase does not appear at @xmath33 , rather , emerge at fairly large coupling ratio .",
    "this is slightly inconsistent with momoi s prediction , but agrees with more carefully executed perturbation calculations.@xcite above the @xmath4 supersolid phase , through a frist order phase transition , the system enters another supersolid phase ( with different triplet pattern ) , in which its magnetization keeps responding continuously to external field , and @xmath102 remains finite , as shown in fig .  [ magnetic - plateaux ] .",
    "in contrast to early studies , this supersolid phase emerges in our calculation and features a crystalline pattern of singlet - triplet description . as a matter of fact",
    ", it can be considered as a natural extension to the @xmath5 plateau state , as the period remains to be 3 rows of dimers .",
    "more specifically , when field @xmath26 is large enough , while one stripe of triplet remain unchanged , two remaining stripes of singlets start to covert to triplets , one row follows another , until all dimers are polarized .",

    "i.e. _ , the correlations @xmath103 on the dimer change from ferromagnetic to af smoothly .",
    "( see example in fig .",

    "we refer to such supersolid phase as p3 supersolid .",
    "the reason that the p3 supersolid phase is favored in energy compared to @xmath4 supersolid at large magnetization region is unclear .",
    "one possible reason is that during the smooth polarization from low magnetization to full saturation , ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath104 ) , the diagonal lro is largely unaffected , which features a period of 3 rows of dimers .",
    "correlated hopping may also be easier in p3 crystalline patterns , which render p3 supersolid an advantage in kinetic energy .",
    "using mera method , we are able to calculate the ground state of the ssl model both in the absence and presence of external magnetic field",
    ". our calculation does not make any approximation of the hamiltonian itself , unlike some early studies , and the ground state we obtained is the result of pure variational calculation .",
    "thermodynamic limit has been reached by meanfield - like approximations ( frmera , although there is subtle difference ) .",
    "we have showed clear evidence of a plaquette vbs order intermediating the af and the decoupled dimer phase .",
    "we have found various magnetic plateaux in the presence of external field , including @xmath105 .",
    "we have also confirmed the existence of supersolid phases above @xmath5 and @xmath4 plateaux , where superfluidity ( off - diagonal lro ) and crystalline pattern of triplet excitations coexist . above the @xmath4 supersolid , another supersolid phase which features period 3 dimer lattice structure persists all the way to saturation .",
    "we have to point out that the frmera method faces difficulties in dealing with incommensurate phases , due to finite unitcell , and lacks in description of long range entanglement that is far beyond the size of the unitcell . nevertheless , it is a very effective numerical method for studying gapped quantum spin systems with frustration .",
    "we have to point out here that dm interaction , which is believed to have profound impact in the material s magnetic properties , is regrettably not included in our discussion .",
    "also effect of higher - order - neighbor interactions have been not included either@xcite .",
    "we notice that it is practical to include them in the calculation , if our mera tensor network is modified accordingly in order to restrain the cost .",
