    "though our understanding of the core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion mechanism remains incomplete , recent simulations indicate that it is likely to involve multi - dimensional effects .",
    "in fact , in all proposed mechanisms neutrino - driven convection plays an important , if not vital , role .",
    "motivated by these results , we present a theoretical framework to investigate the role of turbulence in launching successful explosions .",
    "furthermore , we lay down the foundation for this framework by deriving self - consistent steady - state equations for the background and turbulent flows .",
    "the fundamental problem of ccsn theory is to determine how the stalled shock transitions into a dynamic explosion . within a few milliseconds after bounce , the core - bounce shock wave stalls into an accretion shock @xcite .",
    "unchecked , continued accretion through the shock would form a black hole @xcite .",
    "however , the preponderance of observed neutron stars @xcite and supernova ( sn ) explosions @xcite dictates that the stalled shock is revived into an explosion most of the time .    for more than two decades ,",
    "the favored mechanism for core collapse supernovae has been the delayed - neutrino mechanism @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a neutrino luminosity of several times 10@xmath0 erg / s cools the protoneutron star and heats the region below the shock . under the correct conditions ,",
    "this heating by neutrinos can revive the shock and produce an explosion .",
    "unfortunately , except for the least massive stars which undergo core collapse , most of the detailed 1d neutrino - transport - hydrodynamic simulations do not produce solutions containing explosions @xcite .    while most 1d simulations fail to produce explosive solutions , recent 2d simulations",
    "show promising trends .",
    "these simulations capture multi - dimensional instabilities that aide the neutrino mechanism in driving explosions @xcite .",
    "these instabilities include neutrino - driven convection @xcite and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) @xcite .",
    "besides these two instabilities , other multi - dimensional processes may revive the stalled shock , including magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) jets @xcite and acoustic power derived from asymmetric accretion and an oscillating pns @xcite . though the prevalence of these last two processes is still debated @xcite , two points remain clear : ( 1 ) the solution to the ccsn problem is likely to depend on multi - dimensional effects , and ( 2 ) in all proposed mechanisms , neutrinos and turbulence play an important , if not central , role .",
    "hence , whatever the mechanism , it is important to understand the role of neutrinos and turbulence .",
    "@xcite proposed that if a critical neutrino luminosity is exceeded for a given mass accretion rate , the neutrino mechanism succeeds .",
    "these authors developed a steady - state model for an accretion shock in the presence of a parametrized neutrino heating and cooling profile .",
    "the two most important parameters of the steady - state model are the neutrino luminosity @xmath1 and mass accretion rate @xmath2 .",
    "they found no steady - state solutions for luminosities above a critical curve @xmath3 , and interpreted this curve as separating steady - state ( or failed supernova ) solutions from explosive solutions .",
    "however , this work did not prove that the solutions above the critical curve are in fact explosive , nor did they consider multidimensional effects .    using a similar neutrino parametrization as in the @xcite work , @xcite showed in 1d and 2d simulations that the solutions above the critical luminosity are in fact explosive .",
    "moreover , they found that the critical luminosity in the 2d simulations is @xmath470% of that in 1d for a given @xmath2 .",
    "additional investigations by @xcite show that the critical luminosity is even further reduced in 3d .",
    "these results suggest that the critical luminosity is a useful theoretical framework for describing the conditions for successful explosions @xcite .",
    "initial investigations by @xcite also suggest that the reduction in the critical luminosity is caused by turbulence .",
    "an alternative but related condition for explosion is a comparison of the advection and heating timescales @xcite .",
    "the heating timescale is the time it takes to significantly heat a parcel of matter , and the advection timescale is the time to advect through this region .",
    "if the advection timescale is long compared to the heating timescale , then explosion ensues . in 1d , as matter accretes onto the pns , it is limited to advect through the gain region with one short timescale . in 2d , convective motions increase the dwell time , which leads to more heating for the same neutrino luminosity and a lower critical luminosity@xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently challenged this explanation and suggest that rather than increasing the heating , turbulence acts to reduce the cooling .",
    "regardless , the simulations show that the critical luminosity is lower in the presence of convection .",
    "these results suggest that a theory for successful explosions requires a theoretical framework for turbulence and its influence on the critical luminosity . in this paper",
    ", we develop the foundation for such a framework .",
    "recent developments in turbulence theory have led to accurate turbulence models , and in this paper we use similar strategies to develop a turbulence model appropriate for ccsne .",
    "such a turbulence model can then be incorporated into steady - state accretion models to derive reduced critical luminosities for explosion , as well as used in 1d radiation - hydrodynamic ( rhd ) simulations to expedite systematic studies of core - collapse physics . in the present paper , we develop a turbulence model which captures the salient features of 2d core collapse convection , but eventually the model must be calibrated against 3d simulations .",
    "to develop a turbulence model appropriate for core - collapse turbulence , we use a general and fully self - consistent approach called reynolds decomposition @xcite .",
    "the first step in this approach is to decompose the flow variables into averaged and fluctuating components .",
    "evolution equations for the mean flow variables are then developed by writing the conservation laws in terms of these mean and fluctuating components and then averaging .",
    "the resulting evolution equations for the mean fields contain terms which involve both the mean fields as well as correlations of fluctuating components .",
    "these correlations represent the action of turbulence and include the reynolds stress , turbulent kinetic energy , turbulent enthalpy flux , and higher order correlations .",
    "these evolution equations are self - consistent and naturally include the effects of a background flow , which is important in core collapse .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure always produces evolution equations which depend on a correlation of higher order than the evolution equations .",
    "therefore , in order to develop a closed system of equations , the highest order correlations must be modeled in terms of the lower order correlations and mean fields .",
    "furthermore , closure depends upon the macroscopic flow itself , so there is no unique closure for turbulence .",
    "this is the infamous closure problem of turbulence .",
    "fortunately , there is a small class of turbulent flows ( e.g. , shear , buoyancy driven , etc . ) and closure models have been developed that work well for each type under a range of conditions @xcite .",
    "the general strategy to find closure relations involves an interplay between theory , observations , and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "first , terms in the mean - field equations are compared to either observations or numerical simulations .",
    "approximations are then proposed for the higher order correlation terms that satisfy the observations / simulations and provide closure .",
    "this approach has been used successfully for geophysical flows @xcite and is now being applied to stellar structure calculations @xcite .    following on these successes ,",
    "we use this strategy to develop a turbulence model for the core - collapse problem in which buoyancy and a background accretion flow dominate . in   [ section : reynoldsdecomp ] , we use reynolds decomposition to formally derive the averaged background and turbulence equations and identify terms that are important for neutrino - driven convection . using 2d simulations , we examine in ",
    "[ section : compare2d ] the turbulent properties of neutrino - driven convection and show that the turbulence equations which we derive in ",
    "[ section : reynoldsdecomp ] are consistent with the simulated flows .",
    "finding solutions to the mean - field equations requires a closure model .",
    "therefore , in   [ section : models ] we present several models representative of the literature .",
    "however , these fail to reproduce the global profiles of neutrino - driven convection , leading us to develop a novel global model . in ",
    "[ section : comparemodels ] , we compare the results of the turbulence models (   [ section : models ] ) with the results of 2d simulations and conclude that our global model is the only model to reproduce the global properties of neutrino - driven convection . in   [ section : conditions ] , using the mean - field equations and 2d simulations , we investigate the effects of turbulence on the conditions for successful explosions . finally , in  [ section : conclusion ] we summarize our findings , and motivate the need for a similar analysis using 3d simulation data .",
    "the first step in understanding the effects of turbulence is to derive the governing steady - state equations .",
    "therefore , in this section , we use reynolds decomposition to derive exact equations for the steady - state background and turbulent flows .",
    "historically , turbulence modelers have used two approaches to derive the models . in one ,",
    "ad hoc equations are suggested to model the important turbulence physics .",
    "these are often of practical use , but the underlying assumptions often make these of limited use . mixing length theory ( mlt ) is one such approach ( see  [ section : algebraic ] for its limitations ) @xcite . in the second approach , one derives self - consistent equations for turbulence by decomposing the hydrodynamic equations into background and turbulent parts .",
    "reynolds decomposition is an example of this approach .",
    "though these equations are exact , they are not complete ; they need a model for closure .",
    "if the ad hoc approaches accurately represent nature , then one should be able to derive them by making the appropriate assumptions in the exact equations .",
    "therefore , regardless of the technique employed , starting with the self - consistent equations enables a better understanding of the assumptions and limitations . in this paper , we pursue both approaches , but in this section , we use reynolds decomposition to derive and explore the self - consistent equations for the background and turbulent flows .    in reynolds decomposition , the hydrodynamic equations are decomposed into background and turbulent flows @xcite . consider a generic flow variable , @xmath5 , and its decomposition into average ( background ) and fluctuating ( turbulent ) components : @xmath6 .",
    "the mean - field background of @xmath5 , @xmath7 , is obtained by coarse spatial and temporal averages .",
    "the interval for the averages must be large or long enough to smooth out short term turbulent fluctuations , but they must not be too large or long so that interesting spatial or temporal trends in the mean - field quantities are completely averaged out .",
    "choosing the scales of the averaging window is dependent upon the problem , and in this paper , we define @xmath8 as averaging over the solid angle in the spherical coordinate system and over a fraction of the eddy crossing time of the convective region . by definition ,",
    "the coarse average of @xmath5 is @xmath9 and the mean - field average of the fluctuation is identically zero , @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , first order moments of turbulent fluctuations are identically zero and only higher order terms survive .",
    "for example , the average of the velocity fluctuation is zero , @xmath11 , but the mean - field of the second order term , the reynolds stress @xmath12 , is nonzero .",
    "the general equations for mass , momentum , and entropy conservation are @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 in these equations , the density , velocity , pressure , temperature , and specific entropy are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath22 is the specific local heating and/or cooling rate .",
    "after reynolds decomposition , averaging , and assuming steady state , the hydrodynamics equations , eqs .",

    "the background velocity is @xmath28 , and the perturbed velocity is @xmath29 .",
    "equations [ eq : mass]-[eq : entropy ] are very similar to the usual steady - state equations of hydrodynamics , but the last term in all three equations add new turbulence physics .",
    "conservation of mass flux is split between the background and the turbulence , @xmath30 . in the momentum equation ,",
    "the extra force due to turbulence is the divergence of the reynolds stress , @xmath31 .",
    "the entropy equation has two new terms ; the divergence of the entropy flux , @xmath32 , represents entropy redistribution by turbulence , and @xmath33 represents heat due to turbulence dissipation . for isotropic turbulence , the divergence of @xmath34 can be re - cast as the gradient of turbulent pressure : i.e. @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "using thermodynamic relations , we reduce the number of turbulent correlations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mass]-[eq : entropy ] ) by noting that @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the specific heat at constant pressure , and @xmath40 is the logarithmic derivative of density with respect to temperature at constant pressure .    while we consider the convective entropy flux , @xmath41 , traditionally , astrophysicists have considered the enthalpy flux , @xmath42 in turbulence models .",
    "the enthalpy flux has units of energy flux .",
    "therefore , the enthalpy flux is a natural choice for stellar structure calculations in which the enthalpy flux and radiative flux must add to give the total luminosity of the star . because the convective region is semi - transparent to neutrinos",
    ", there is no such constraint in the core - collapse problem .",
    "furthermore , since we decompose the entropy equation , the entropy flux is the most natural flux to consider .",
    "for the instances that require discussing the enthalpy flux , we express it in terms of the entropy flux , @xmath43 .",
    "in expressing ( @xmath44 , we have eliminated one of the turbulent correlations , but there still remain three turbulent correlations ( @xmath34 , @xmath41 , and @xmath33 ) , resulting in more unknowns than equations . to close these equations , we derive the turbulence equations in   [ section : turbulenceequations ] ) .",

    "the shear production term is less important .",
    "however , this term and the pressure - strain term are primarily responsible for redistributing stress among the components . for example",

    "they are buoyant and gradient production terms , the pressure - covariance , turbulent transport , and heat production . unlike the reynolds stress equation",

    "the only solution is to develop a closure model to relate higher order moments to lower order moments .",
    "this is analogous to the closure problem in deriving the hydrodynamics equations . in the hydrodynamics equations ,",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is a microphysical closure model which relates the pressure ( a higher moment ) to the density and internal energy .",
    "because of the vast separation of scale , the eos depends upon microphysical processes only and is independent of the macroscopic hydrodynamical flows .",
    "hence , as a closure model , the eos enables the hydrodynamic equations to be relevant for a wide range of macroscopic flows .",
    "conversely , turbulence occupies the full range of scales from the microscopic to the largest bulk flows . in some cases , turbulence is the dominant macroscopic flow .",
    "consequently , closure is necessarily dependent upon the macroscopic flow , making it impossible to derive a generic closure relation for turbulence .    to find solutions to the turbulence equations , we need to construct a turbulence closure model that is appropriate for core collapse .",

    "after matter accretes through the shock , it advects downward through the gain region , producing a negative entropy gradient . in turn , this negative entropy gradient drives buoyant convection .",
    "though the region below the gain radius has a positive entropy gradient and is formally stable to convection , momentum carries plumes well into the cooling region @xcite .",
    "this is a well known phenomenon in stellar convection and is called overshoot . in neutrino - driven convection , the depth of overshoot can be quite large , @xmath420 - 40 km , @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : mass]-[eq : entropyvariance ] ) .",
    "the lowest moment correlations are the turbulent enthalpy flux ( @xmath79 ) , the turbulent kinetic energies ( @xmath80 & @xmath81 ; or reynolds stresses ) , and the entropy variance ( @xmath82 ) , and all three are shown in the top , middle , and bottom panels of fig .

    "the radial profiles of these higher order correlations are in fig .",
    "[ transport3times ] . in general",
    ", all turbulent correlations increase over time , and the radial profiles indicate that turbulence is dominated by coherent rising and sinking large - scale buoyant plumes .    the enthalpy ( or entropy ) flux has two broad physical interpretations .",
    "most obviously , the entropy flux indicates the direction and magnitude of entropy transport due to turbulent motions .",
    "naturally , positive and negative entropy fluxes correspond to upward and downward entropy transport .",
    "in addition to indicating the direction of entropy transport , the sign of the flux also indicates the direction of the buoyancy forces driving the turbulence . to understand this second interpretation ,",
    "consider that the entropy flux is defined using the correlation of the velocity and entropy perturbations ( i.e. @xmath86 ) . in regions where convection is actively driven ,",
    "high entropy plumes rise buoyantly and low entropy plumes sink .",
    "in other words , the entropy and velocity perturbations are either both positive or negative .",
    "hence , the correlation and entropy flux are always positive in regions of actively driven convection . at boundaries , where the plumes are decelerated due to a stable background , the correlation or entropy flux ,",
    "is always negative .",
    "for example , as a low entropy plume penetrates into the lower stable layer , the sinking plume becomes immersed in a background that has even lower entropy . while the velocity perturbation remains negative , the entropy perturbation changes sign , becoming positive .",
    "consequently , the correlation and entropy flux are negative in the bounding stabilizing regions .    with these interpretations of the entropy ( enthalpy ) flux , the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fskinetic3times ] shows where convection is actively driven , where plumes are decelerated by bounding stable regions , and the magnitude of each as a function of time . at the shock ,",
    "the entropy flux is zero .",
    "this is in contrast with the results of @xcite , who find an appreciable enthalpy flux at the shock . whether the enthalpy flux is zero at the shock has consequences for the stalled - accretion shock solution ( see   [ section : model1 ] for further discussion ) .",
    "naively , one would expect the gain radius ( @xmath4100  km ) to mark the boundary between actively driven convection in the heating region and the stabilizing effects in the cooling layers below .",
    "though this is roughly correct , careful inspection of the enthalpy profiles show that the transition from positive to negative entropy flux does not correspond exactly with the gain radius .",
    "instead , the gain radius corresponds best with the change in slope of the enthalpy profile . above the gain radius , where convection is actively driven",
    ", the enthalpy profile has a negative gradient , and below the gain radius the gradient is positive .",
    "this profile can be best understood considering a single low entropy plume originating at the shock .",
    "first of all , as this plume accelerates downward , both the entropy and velocity perturbations grow in magnitude .",
    "this explains the negative entropy flux gradient above the gain radius . below the gain radius",
    "the background entropy gradient is positive .",
    "therefore , the entropy perturbation diminishes as the background entropy reduces to the level of the low entropy plume . at this point , both the entropy perturbation and entropy flux are zero . consequently , enthalpy flux gradient is positive below the gain radius . with a negative gradient above the gain region and a positive gradient below it ,",
    "the enthalpy flux is maximum at the gain radius .",
    "as the plume s inertia carries it beyond this radius , the enthalpy flux becomes negative in the stabilizing layers .",
    "these general characteristics are observed at all times , but with increasing magnitude at later times when convection is more vigorous .",
    "the same simple model can explain the radial ( @xmath87 , green lines ) and tangential ( @xmath88 , orange lines ) kinetic energy profiles in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fskinetic3times ] .",
    "in fact , like the enthalpy flux , @xmath89 peaks at the gain radius . because the sinking plumes have higher speeds than the rising plumes and the kinetic energy is weighted by the square of the speed , @xmath90 is dominated by the sinking plumes",
    ". again , the radial profile of @xmath91 is consistent with low entropy plumes originating at the shock , accelerating downward to a maximum speed at the gain radius , and decelerating in the stabilizing region below the gain radius .",
    "this is also consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "the tangential component , @xmath92 , on the other hand , shows a maximum just 10s of km away from the shock .",
    "this is where the rising plumes encounter material that has just passed through the shock and both turn their trajectories in the @xmath62-direction .",
    "interpretation of the entropy variance ( @xmath82 and the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fskinetic3times ] ) is less clear . like the enthalpy flux and kinetic energies",
    ", @xmath82 increases with time .",
    "the most naive interpretation is that the variation of total heating among the sinking and rising plumes increases over time .",
    "however , it is not obvious whether this increase in variance is due to more heating or less cooling in either the rising or sinking plumes ... or both . while it seems clear that the profiles of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are dominated by the sinking plumes , there is circumstantial evidence that @xmath82 might be dominated by the behavior of rising plumes .",
    "for one , there is a gradual rise in @xmath82 from the lower convective boundary to the upper boundary , suggesting growth with the rise of buoyant plumes .",
    "but the most telling evidence comes from the entropy color maps of fig .",
    "[ convectionsasistills ] . in these maps",
    ", it is obvious that the entropy of the sinking plumes is roughly constant over time , while the entropy of rising plumes increases with time .",
    "hence , the variance of entropy increases with time because the maximum entropy of the rising plumes increases .",
    "all three transport terms in fig .",
    "[ transport3times ] , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , are negative nearly everywhere .",

    "[ entropy3times ] shows that the differences in the average cooling between 1d and 2d are small and do not greatly affect the entropy profile .",
    "when the convective terms are ignored , the 2d ( solid green ) and 1d ( solid red ) entropy profiles are quite similar .",
    "though there are small differences , the differences in average cooling profiles are dwarfed by the effects of including the convective terms in the entropy equation ( dot - dashed green curve ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that changes in the average cooling between 1d and 2d lead to the reduction in the critical luminosity .",
    "rather , as we argue in  [ section : conditions ] it is more likely that the divergence of the convective entropy flux is responsible for the extra entropy , higher sound speeds , and a reduction in the critical luminosity .",
    "recent simulations of ccsne indicate that turbulence reduces the critical neutrino luminosity for successful explosions .",
    "this suggests that a theory for successful explosions requires a theoretical framework for turbulence and its influence on the critical luminosity . in this paper , we develop a foundation for this framework , which is represented by the following results :    we derive the exact steady - state equations for the background and turbulent flow .",

    "@xcite proposed a critical neutrino luminosity for successful explosions and @xcite used 1d and 2d simulations to show that this condition indeed separates steady state accretion from dynamic explosions .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that explosions occur when the advection timescale through the gain region exceeds the heating timescale .",
    "more recently , @xcite suggest an ante - sonic condition in which explosions occur once @xmath257 exceeds 0.2 . in fig .",
    "[ ratiospeeds3times ] , we show that in 2d simulations , @xmath257 indeed reaches 0.2 at explosion .",
    "moreover , using our reynolds - averaged equations , we show that the timescale and the ante - sonic conditions are intimately related , and in both conditions , convection aides explosion because turbulence raises the entropy by a term proportional to @xmath258 .    in summary , our global turbulence model contains no free parameters , is globally self - consistent , accurately reproduces the mean - field properties of 2d ccsn turbulence , and promises to explain the reduction in the critical luminosity . despite these successes ,",
    "closure approximations generically depend upon the properties of the macroscopic flow , making them case - dependent .",
