    "it seems that the long - term variations of the sunspot s activity and phenomena similar to the maunder minimum are widely presented on the late - type stars like the sun , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "generally , it may be usefull to distinguish the different kinds of time variations of magnetic activity on the stars for two type .",
    "one is irregular disappearence of sunspot cycle similarily to what was happened during the maunder minimum at the second half of the 17-th centure , @xcite .",
    "another kind of variations can be attributed to the quasi - regular grand activity cycles .",
    "the grand activity cycles is natural to explain as a result of the nonlinear interactions between magnetic fields and the main sources of the solar dynamo , which are the differential rotation and convection , @xcite .",
    "the given nonlinear mechanisms may be responsible for the chaotic variations of magnetic activity on the late type stars and on the sun , as well .",
    "though , the chaotic behaviour was demostrated only in the case of the highly supercritical dynamos , @xcite .",
    "currently , some doubts are cast upon the possibilitiy for the supercritical regimes in the stellar dynamo .",
    "the main constraint for feasibility of the supercritical dynamo is due to magnetic helicity conservation .",
    "however , the problem can be overcome if to allow the helicity outflux of the dynamo region .",
    "another contraint come into the play if to consider the distributed dynamo . in this case",
    "the energy of the generated large - scale magnetic fields ( lsmf ) is hardly to exceed the equipartition level with the energy of convective flow .",
    "these arguments motivate us to look for mechanisms which could induce the long - term variations for such a weakly non - linear dynamo regimes .    in this paper",
    "we consider an effect that can provide a nonlinear coupling between two main sources of the solar dynamo , these are the differential rotation and @xmath0 effect . in according to @xcite the shear ( differential rotation ) changes both the structure and the amplitude of the alpha effect .",
    "for the sun the most important component of alpha effect is @xmath1 .",
    "the estimation of shear contribution to the @xmath1 with regards fo the typical conditions in the solar cz shows that it gives only about 15% of the whole magnitude . in the nonlinear dynamo the lsmf are included in the angular momentum balance inside cz .",
    "in fact the grand activity cycle may be considered as a result of relaxion of the pertubations angular momentum balance in cz emerged due to lsmf ( via the @xmath2-quenching@xcite , or the large - scale lorenz force@xcite ) . in this case",
    "the incorporation of the shear - induced alpha effect can complicate the relaxion process because it supplies the additional destabilization the sources of magnetic filed generation due to the time - dependence of the alpha effect on the differential rotation distribution in cz .",
    "below , we demonstrate the significance of the shear - induced alpha - effect for the long - term evolution of magnetic activity using the numerical model of the axisymmetric dynamo in the convective shell .",
    "the model includes the numerical solution for the dynamo equations , angular momentum balance and heat transport problem with reagards for the physical conditions that take place in the main part of the solar cz . in the next part of the paper",
    "we give the short description of the model ( more details can be found in the article@xcite ) .",
    "the results of numerical simulations are discussed at the third part of the paper .",
    "the basic physical quantities under considerations are the induction vector of the axisymmetric lsmf , @xmath3 , the large - scale flow - differential rotation , @xmath4 ( we neglect the meridional circulation , here ) , the mean specific entropy , @xmath5 , and the pressure , @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic activity and differential rotation give rise to pertubations of the thermodynamic stage of scz .",

    "the fig.[cap : lt1 ] shows some results of numerical simulations in the case of @xmath83 . on the left side of the fig.[cap : lt1 ]",
    "we put the results concerning the variations of the integral magnetic flux @xmath84(top ) , parity @xmath85(middle ) and latitudinal shear ( bottom ) . the shear is quantified by the difference of angular velocity between equator and poles .",
    "this difference is averaged over n and s - hemispheres . there with solid line we draw the result of simulated evolutions with regards for shear - induced alpha effect .",
    "the dashed line shows the same but with the discarded contribution of shear to alpha effect . in the picture we filtered out the short cycle to see the long - term behaviour more clearly . in both case",
    "we see the long - term variation of the magnetic activity .",
    "they are caused ( similar to @xcite ) primerely by the global interaction of lsmf and differential rotation .",
    "it is clearly seen that pattern of the long - term variations is much more complicated if the shear - induced alpha effect is allowed for . though this effect is certainly not the principal factor in exciting the long - term variation . in particular , for this model the most important factors driving the long - term variations are the @xmath2-quenching , the large - scale lorentz force and the non - linear magnetic diffusion .",
    "the long - term variations disappears if one of them is excluded .    on the right side of the fig.[cap : lt1 ] we draw the butterfly diagramm of toroidal lsmf near the surface for time interval about 200 years ( top ) .",
    "the amplitude of magnetic field changes is 400 gs . the corresponding diagramm of the torsional variations of angular velocity at the surface for this period is given at the middle .",
    "the variations is measured by deviations of the current value of angular velocity from the moving mean quantity obtained with averaging on the period of cycle .",
    "the frequency of torsional variations is twice to the basic frequency of magnetic cycle .",
    "the magnitude of the deviations of roatational velocity is about 4@xmath86 .",
    "the diagramm of the long - term variations of angular velocity spanning the whole interval of simulations is at the bottom .",
    "the short - term torsional oscillations are filtered out there .",
    "the negative deviations of velocity are shown with dashed contours and positive ones are shown with solid lines .",
    "the amplitude of seqular modulation of surface angular velocity is about 40 m / s . according to the given diagramm",
    "the relatively accelerated ( or slow down ) zones occupy the high latitude of the solar surface and they drift to poles in course of grand activity cycle . on the picture some isolines span from pole to pole what can be interpreted as the angular momentum exchanges between hemispheres .",
    "this confirms the global nature of the long - term variations demonstrated by our model .    at the end",
    "we discuss briefly the possible impact of the long - term variations of magnetic activity and differential rotation to the heat transport and hydrostatic balance in scz .",
    "the heat transport is described with eq.([seq ] ) .",
    "the description of hydrostatic balance with regards for lsmf and differential rotation is given in , .the contribution of magnetic field to irradiance output is estimated by the outflux of the lsmf s energy from the dynamo region .",
    "this gives the maximum amplitude of variations in solar irradiance if we assume that the energy of escaping field is completely converted to radiation .",
    "the radius variations were estimated from the changes of the zero mode of the gravitational potential . on the fig.[cap : lt2 ] we show of the long - term variations of the integral parameters describing the integral magnetic flux and parity ( top ) , the latidudinal shear and the relative radius variations(middle ) , the relative variations of luminocity and the heat outflux ( bottom ) .",
    "the short cycles were fitered out there .",
    "the panel in the middle of fig.[cap : lt2 ] clearly shows that variations of the latitudinal shear and solar radius go in phase , while they vary slightly ahead the changes of the magnetic activity . in our model",
    "the delay is about 100 years .",
    "it worth to note that in the short , 11-th year cycles the radius varies nearly in phase with magnetic cycle with relative amplitude about @xmath87 .",
    "the amplitude of secular variations of radius is larger but it still rather small , @xmath88 .",
    "this model seems to confirm our previus result . in .. we concluded that the primary source of the solar radius changes could be the modulation of the centrifugal forces by magnetic activity ( via modulation of differential rotation ) . in according to simulations",
    "the secular modulation of luminocity due to the escape of the magnetic energy from the dynamo region is about @xmath89 .",
    "this is the _ maximum possible _",
    "estimate for the lsmf input to radiation .",
    "the seqular variations of the heat outflux in the model are rather small,@xmath90 .",
    "they are in anti - phase relation with magnetic activity .",
    "in conclusion we would like to summaries the results of the paper as follows .",
    "the differential rotation modifies the standard alpha effect changing its amplitude and inducing the additional mean electromotive force that is perpendecular to original magnetic field .",
    "the dependence of the alpha effect on differential can complicate the long - term variations in non - linear dynamo .",
    "the main shortcomming of the model presented is that we ignored the helicity conservation law .",
    "some preliminary results given in .. show that the helicity conservation could controll the largest time scale of long - term variation in the non - linear dynamo .",
    "the present model demonstrates the secular variations of radius .",
    "the secular maximum of the radius corresponds to epoch the maximal differential rotation and it foregoes the secular maximum of magnetic activity . the amplitude of of secular variations of radius is @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponded variations of solar irradiance are about @xmath89 .",
