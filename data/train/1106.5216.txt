    "<S> in this paper , we investigate thick branes with a nonminimally coupled background scalar field , whose solution is a single - kink or a double - kink . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the nonminimal coupling constant @xmath0 on the structure of the thick branes and the localization of gravity , fermions , scalars and vectors are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that each brane will split into two sub - branes as increasing the nonminimal coupling constant @xmath0 . by investigating the tensor perturbation equations of gravity and the general covariant dirac equation of fermions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that both the gravity zero mode and left - chiral fermion zero mode are localized at the center of the single - kink branes and localized between the two sub - branes generated by the double - kink , which indicates that the constant @xmath0 does not effect the localization of these zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> however , the zero mode of scalars is localized on each sub - brane ( for both single - kink and double - kink branes ) when @xmath0 is larger than its critical value @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the nonminimal coupling constant @xmath0 on the resonances of gravity and fermions with finite lifetime on the branes are also discussed .    . </S>"
