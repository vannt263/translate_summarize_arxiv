    "the uv upturn is a sharp rise in the spectra of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges shortward of rest - frame 2700   .",
    "also known as the `` uv rising branch '' or the `` uv excess , '' it was discovered with the oao-2 satellite ( code 1969 ) .",
    "prior to this discovery , we did not expect such a uv - bright component to these old , passively - evolving populations .",
    "many candidates were suggested to explain the upturn , including young massive stars , hot white dwarfs , hot horizontal branch ( hb ) and post - hb stars , and non - thermal activity ( see greggio & renzini 1990 for a complete review ) . as the measurements of local ellipticals were expanded with iue , another surprise was the large variation in the strength of the uv upturn from galaxy to galaxy , even though the spectra of ellipticals appear very similar at longer wavelengths .",
    "characterized by the @xmath2 color , the uv upturn becomes stronger and bluer as the metallicity ( optical mg@xmath3 index ) of the galaxy increases , while other colors become redder ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 )    today , it is widely believed that hb stars and their progeny are responsible for the far - uv emission in elliptical galaxies .",
    "there are three classes of post - hb evolution , each evolving from a different range of effective temperature on the zero - age hb . on the red end of the hb",
    ", stars will evolve up the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , undergo thermal pulses , evolve as bright post - agb stars to hotter temperatures , possibly form planetary nebulae , and eventually descend the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling curve . at hotter temperatures",
    "( and lower envelope masses ) on the hb , stars will follow post - early agb evolution : they evolve up the agb , but leave the agb before the thermal pulsing phase , continue to high temperatures at high luminosity , and descend the wd cooling curve .",
    "for the blue extreme of the hb , stars with very little envelope mass will follow agb - manqu@xmath4 evolution , evolving directly to hotter temperatures and brighter luminosities without ever ascending the agb , and finally descending the wd cooling curve .",
    "these three classes of post - hb behavior have very different lifetimes , in the sense that the post - agb stars are bright in the uv for a brief period ( @xmath5 yr ) , the post - early agb stars are uv - bright for a longer period ( @xmath6 yr ) , and the agb - manqu@xmath4 stars are uv - bright for very long periods ( @xmath7 yr ) .",
    "the hb phase itself lasts @xmath8  yr , and so the presence of hot hb stars in a population , combined with the long - lived luminous post - hb phases , gives rise to the strong uv upturn seen in the most massive , metal - rich ellipticals ( see dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "a more significant fraction of the far - uv flux from galaxies with a weak uv upturn can theoretically come from post - agb stars , and in the weakest uv upturn galaxies ( e.g. , m32 ) , the spectra alone do not require the presence of a hot hb .",
    "the zero age hb ( zahb ) is not only a sequence in effective temperature : it is also a sequence in mass ( see dorman , rood , & oconnell 1993 ) . for @xmath9",
    "k , a small change in envelope mass ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ) corresponds to a large change in t@xmath12 ( @xmath13  k ) . because the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) mass decreases as age increases , the zahb will become bluer as a population ages , assuming all other parameters ( e.g. , mass loss on the red giant branch , metallicity , helium abundance , etc . )",
    "remain fixed .",
    "note that this does not necessarily imply that age is the `` second parameter '' of hb morphology ( e.g. , see sweigart s work in these proceedings ) .",
    "the implied first parameter of the hb morphology debate is metallicity ; the hb becomes bluer at lower metallicity , assuming all other parameters ( age , mass loss , etc . )",
    "remain fixed .",
    "this is due to two reasons .",
    "first , the msto mass at a given age is lower at lower metallicity , because a metal - poor star is more luminous ( and thus shorter - lived ) than a metal - rich star of the same mass .",
    "second , as the metallicity decreases , the envelope opacity decreases , the star will have a higher t@xmath12 , and the hb becomes bluer . in short",
    ", hb morphology tends to become bluer at lower metallicity and higher ages , but other parameters also play a role ( rotation , he abundance , deep mixing , etc . ) , leading to the second parameter debate .",
    "our understanding of the uv upturn is clearly linked to this debate , given the presence of hot hb stars in metal - rich elliptical galaxies .    because hb morphology is sensitive to age",
    ", greggio & renzini ( 1990 ) noted that the uv upturn should also be very sensitive to age ; bressan , chiosi , & fagotto ( 1994 ) demonstrated that the uv upturn might even be useful as a diagnostic for determining the ages of old ellipticals .",
    "indeed , using the infall model of chemical evolution , tantalo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) demonstrated that the @xmath2 color in an old elliptical galaxy spectrum ( age @xmath14  gyr ) could change by 4 mag over a timescale of a few gyr , while other well - studied colors ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , etc . ) only change by @xmath20 mag on the same timescale .",
    "unfortunately , the many parameters that govern hb morphology remain poorly constrained , and thus this age diagnostic has yet to be calibrated .",
    "in 1990 and 1995 , the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) observed six quiescent local elliptical galaxies as part of the astro-1 and astro-2 space shuttle missions ( see davidsen et al .",
    "1992 for a description of the instrument and its capabilities ) .",
    "these galaxies  ngc1399 , m60 , m89 , m49 , ngc3115 , and ngc3379  span a wide range of uv upturn strength ( @xmath21 ) , but their far - uv ( 9001800   ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are all similar to those of stars with 20,000  k @xmath22  t@xmath23 23,000  k ( brown , ferguson , & davidsen 1995 ) .",
    "the data are inconsistent with ongoing star formation following a normal imf : there is a lack of civ absorption , and the flux decreases shortward of 1100  (ferguson et al .",
    "the hut spectra are not dominated by a population of post - agb stars , else they would appear much hotter .",
    "furthermore , the fuel - consumption theorem ( greggio & renzini 1990 ) relates the stellar evolutionary flux ( sef ) , also known as the stellar death rate , to the bolometric luminosity within the hut aperture ; this constraint means that the relatively short - lived post - agb stars can not produce the magnitude of flux observed by hut .",
    "however , the hut spectra are consistent with the integrated light of hot hb stars and their descendants .",
    "the data demonstrate that a minority population ( @xmath24% of the sef ) of hot hb stars and their descendants can produce the far - uv light , with a small contribution from the remaining stars that evolve along post - agb tracks ( brown et al .",
    "m32 is usually considered a `` compact elliptical '' instead of a dwarf elliptical ( see da costa 1997 and references therein ) , and as such it is the closest example of a true elliptical galaxy .",
    "given its proximity , we can resolve the hot population in the core of the galaxy with the hst .",
    "several programs have used the faint object camera ( foc ) toward this end , prior to and after refurbishment of the hst ( see brown et al .",
    "1998b and references therein ) .",
    "brown et al.(1998b ) resolved 183 stars in the center of m32 ; the colors and luminosities of these stars placed them in the agb - manqu@xmath25 and post - early - agb evolutionary phases .",
    "although these uv observations were not deep enough to resolve the hot hb , they did imply that the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) could achieve this goal in a reasonable allocation of observing time .    in october 1998 ,",
    "the stis observed a @xmath26 field , centered @xmath27 from the m32 core , using the near - uv detector ( nuv - mama with f25qtz filter ) , for 23 ksec .",
    "the relatively large throughput of the bandpass , combined with the lack of red leak , allowed the detection of 8000 hot hb and post - hb stars in the center of m32 .",
    "photometric reduction was done via psf - fitting with the daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) ; the stars were placed on the stmag photometric standard , where a flat @xmath28 spectrum of 1 erg s@xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath31 mag . in the stmag magnitude system , the stars in our photometric catalog span a range of 2128 mag ; in the deepest parts of the image , the catalog is reasonably complete ( @xmath32 25% ) to 27 mag .",
    "the hot hb spans a range of 2527 mag at t@xmath33 8500  k , and thus these images are sufficiently deep for photometry on the hot hb .",
    "we have calculated a set of solar - metallicity hb and post - hb evolutionary tracks for comparison with the stis data .",
    "although the analysis of the data is in progress , the southwest half of the image , a section that ranges 820@xmath34 from the center of the galaxy , is sufficiently deep and uncrowded to allow a preliminary investigation of the evolved population . in that region ,",
    "the uncorrected stis luminosity function ranges from @xmath35 stars per 0.5  mag bin at 2224 mag , and increases to hundreds of stars per bin at magnitudes fainter than 25 . including a completeness correction",
    ", there are over a thousand stars per bin near 27 mag .",
    "post - agb stars alone can not produce such a luminosity function , if they evolve in the manner described by the h - burning and he - burning tracks found in the literature ( e.g. , sch@xmath36nberner 1987 ; vassiliadis & wood 1994 ) . in this portion of the stis image",
    ", the bolometric luminosity can be determined from the extant optical data , a bolometric correction of @xmath37 mag ( worthey 1994 ) , an extinction correction assuming @xmath38 ( ferguson & davidsen 1993 ) , and a distance modulus of 24.43 mag . the fuel consumption theorem ( greggio & renzini 1990 ) relates the bolometric luminosity to the stellar evolutionary flux : sef@xmath39 stars yr@xmath40 stars yr@xmath29 . even with all of these stars evolving through a given post - agb channel , the post - agb tracks with mass larger than 0.6 m@xmath41 evolve rapidly , and would only produce a tiny fraction of the stars in the stis image .",
    "the slowest tracks , such as the 0.546 m@xmath41 track of sch@xmath42nberner ( 1987 ) , actually present two problems .",
    "first , they produce dozens of stars per 0.5  mag bin at 21 @xmath43 stmag @xmath43 24 mag , which are many more than observed by stis .",
    "second , this track also produces dozens of stars per bin at 24 @xmath43 stmag @xmath43 28 mag , where stis observed an order of magnitude more , even without correcting for completeness . because the post - agb stars in this old population are presumably evolving along low - mass tracks",
    ", the lack of bright stars in the stis image may be an indication that the post - agb transition from the agb to the later and hotter phases ( t@xmath44  k ) occurs on much more rapid timescales than those expected from the canonical tracks , or is dust - enshrouded ( see , e.g. , k@xmath45ufl , renzini , & stanghellini , 1993 ) .",
    "in contrast , the presence of hot hb stars and their progeny easily reproduces the large number of faint stars seen by stis .",
    "if @xmath46% of the sef passes through the hot hb , the resulting luminosity function is in close agreement with the stis data , over the entire range of observed magnitudes .",
    "the resulting uv spectrum from such a population agrees with the weak uv flux measured by iue ( burstein et al .",
    "given the small fraction of the population entering the hot hb , we must conclude that the vast majority of the population passes through the red hb phase and the subsequent post - agb evolution .",
    "so , although a small population of hot hb stars can explain the stars present in the stis image , we still must explain the lack of bright stars .",
    "the post - agb stars must either be evolving along more massive ( and thus more rapidly evolving ) tracks , the transition time from the agb to the hotter post - agb phases must be more rapid than that expected from the canonical low - mass tracks , or this transition must be enshrouded in circumstellar dust .",
    "whichever the case , the contribution of post - agb stars to the stis luminosity function would be small .",
    "note that very young ages ( @xmath47  gyr ) are required to produce main sequence stars brighter than the hb , and so the stis image is dominated by an old population .",
    "the stis image convincingly demonstrates that the weak uv upturn in m32 comes from a small population of hot hb stars and their descendants .",
    "prior to these data , the weak uv upturn in m32 could have been explained by low - mass post - agb stars alone , without violating fuel consumption constraints on the sef .",
    "far - uv imaging of the same field with stis would be useful to provide color information for these stars .",
    "colors would further constrain the hb morphology , and provide clues to the post - agb evolution , because post - agb stars presumably contribute a small but significant fraction of stars to the stis luminosity function .",
    "the uv upturn is thought to evolve rapidly as a population ages . some groups ( e.g. , yi et al .",
    "1999 ) have predicted a rapid decline in uv upturn strength at increasing redshift ; others ( e.g. tantalo et al.1996 ) predict that the uv upturn should show a strong increase at intermediate ages ( @xmath14 gyr ) , followed by a period where it is approximately constant . in this latter scenario ,",
    "the amount of fading expected at higher redshifts depends upon the formation redshift of the elliptical galaxy in question .",
    "several previous attempts to measure the uv upturn at intermediate redshifts , using uv imaging and spectroscopy with the hst , have been inconclusive ( e.g. , windhorst et al .",
    "1994 ; renzini 1996 ; buson et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the foc can observe with two long - pass filters that are appropriate for observations of the uv upturn at intermediate redshift .",
    "specifically , the f130lp and f370lp filters provide a discriminator between flux longward and shortward of 3700   , corresponding to a rest - frame wavelength of 25002700    in the redshift range 1.481.37 .",
    "this rest - frame wavelength represents the spectral division between the hot evolved populations that produce the far - uv flux and the cooler rgb , agb , and msto populations responsible for the @xmath48-band flux .",
    "we have obtained foc measurements of four ellipticals in the galaxy cluster abell  370 , at @xmath0 , to measure the uv upturn at a lookback time of @xmath49  gyr ( brown et al.1998a ) .",
    "abell 370 is a well - studied galaxy cluster .",
    "the four ellipticals in our analysis ( bo # 10 , 24a , 24b , & 34 ; butcher , oemler , & wells 1983 ) have all been observed spectroscopically from the ground ( soucail et al .",
    "1988 ) ; these spectra confirm their cluster membership , are consistent with passively - evolving old populations , and show no evidence of star formation ( e.g. , from [ oii ] ) .",
    "their @xmath50 colors are also consistent with passive evolution ( maclaren , ellis , & couch 1988 ) .",
    "morphological classification is confirmed by wfpc ( couch et al .",
    "1994 ) and wfpc2 ( hst go program 6003 ) imaging .",
    "we performed aperture photometry upon these four cluster ellipticals , using two aperture sizes : 65 pixels ( @xmath51 ) and 12 pixels ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the large aperture includes all of the light detected by the foc ; the smaller aperture gives a measurement of the core light , and may be more appropriate for comparison to measurements of the uv upturn in local ellipticals , which were done with iue . local ellipticals usually show a weaker uv upturn at increasing radius ( ohl et al .",
    "we show our measured flux ratios in table 1 .",
    "exposure times varied from 28008500 sec , and so our counting statistics are quite good .",

    "after redshifting the spectra of three local ellipticals ( m49 , m60 , and ngc1399 ) to @xmath0 , we used the iraf / synphot / calcphot package to predict the f130lp / f370lp flux ratio that would be observed for these local galaxies , if they were members of abell  370 .",
    "the predictions are shown in table 1 .",
    "as the table demonstrates , in a large aperture , the abell 370 ellipticals all show a uv upturn at least as strong as that seen in m49 . in a nuclear aperture ,",
    "three of these four ellipticals show even stronger uv upturn colors , with one as strong as that in m60 .",
    "comparison to the redshifted spectra of local ellipticals assumes a non - evolving template for the interpretation .",
    "however , the main sequence turnoff becomes bluer and brighter at decreasing age , and so we also compare our measurements with the predictions for an evolving elliptical galaxy .",
    "tantalo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) computed the seds of elliptical galaxies as a function of age , assuming a range of galaxy masses , with chemical evolution following the infall model . in their models ,",
    "the rise of the uv upturn occurs at @xmath14  gyr , but note that the actual age of this occurrence may vary by several gyr , depending upon the assumptions made regarding mass loss , @xmath54 , and details regarding the chemical evolution .",
    "the observed f130lp / f370lp flux ratio translates to a rest - frame fuv - lp / nuv - lp flux ratio at @xmath0 , and so we calculated this rest - frame flux ratio as a function of age for the two most massive models in the tantalo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) set : @xmath55  @xmath56 and @xmath57  @xmath56 .",
    "the range of fuv - lp / nuv - lp flux ratio spanned by these models is shown in figure 1 , plotted as a function of lookback time and redshift , for three different formation redshifts ( 2 , 4 , and 8) .",
    "= 4.75 in    although our understanding of the uv upturn and hb morphology is not sufficient to allow its use as an accurate age indicator , it is interesting to consider the implications of our foc measurements , under the assumption that the tantalo et al .  ( 1996 ) models are correct . in the given cosmology , the ellipticals in abell 370",
    "would have formed at @xmath58 in order to demonstrate such strong uv upturn colors . for @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "the implied formation redshift is not significantly changed ; for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the implied formation redshift is higher .",
    "if the abell 370 ellipticals and the local population of ellipticals both formed at a common redshift @xmath63 , the lack of evolution seen in the uv upturn can be understood as evidence that both epochs are on the `` flat '' portion of the uv upturn evolutionary curves , after the uv upturn has leveled off .",
    "note that a small amount of star formation is sufficient to produce a significant uv upturn in these galaxies .",
    "although these ellipticals appear to be passively evolving , less than 0.1 @xmath56 yr@xmath29 of star formation would be enough to produce the uv upturn we observe ( see madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ) ; this level of star formation is slightly below the constraints available from the extant data .",
    "our measurements provide a first step in mapping the evolution of the uv upturn with lookback time .",
    "further observations are clearly needed to rule out star formation as the source of the uv emission in these high redshift galaxies , and to trace the evolution to both higher and lower redshifts .",
    "hst observations of a cluster at @xmath64 are planned in the near future ( gto program # 8020 ) .",
    "unless the redshift of formation is very high , these galaxies ought to be very faint in the far - uv .",
    "once the uv upturn is measured in a statistically significant number of galaxies over a range of redshifts , the evolution can be determined independent of star formation contamination .",
    "it would be unlikely that small levels of star formation could be synchronized within clusters and change as a function of redshift to mimic the uv upturn evolution .",
    "the uv upturn provides a sensitive tracer of age in old populations , and can potentially constrain the evolutionary history of ellipticals with a diagnostic that is independent of those used at longer wavelengths .",
    "spectra and photometry of local ellipticals confirm that hot hb stars are responsible for the uv upturn , and so the calibration of the uv upturn as an age diagnostic will depend upon a better understanding of the mechanisms driving hb morphology ( e.g. , rgb mass loss ) . measurements of the uv upturn at a series of redshifts should provide insight into the chemical evolution of galaxies and the production of hot hb stars in metal - rich populations , with the eventual goal of constraining the formation history of ellipticals .",
