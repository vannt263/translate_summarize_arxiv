    "the exciton and trion binding energies in 2d chalcogenides are almost an order of magnitude larger compared to other bulk semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the large exciton and trion binding energies imply that many body interactions play an important role in determining the optical properties of these materials . for most optoelectronic applications , knowing the radiative lifetimes of elementary excitations is critical .",
    "excitons and trions in metal dichalcogenides have small radii and , therefore , large oscillator strengths and , consequently , one expects their radiative lifetimes to be particularly short .    in recent work  @xcite , we quantitatively determined the oscillator strengths of excitons and trions in monolayer metal dichalcogenide mos@xmath0 from the experimentally measured optical absorption spectra .",
    "our work showed that the traditional wannier - mott exciton model  @xcite , with a few modifications , is able to describe the excitons and trions fairly well in 2d dichalcogenides .",

    "we report the radiative lifetimes of excitons and trions .",
    "our results show that the small exciton radius and the large exciton optical oscillator strength in mos@xmath0 monolayers result in radiative lifetimes in the 0.18 - 0.30 ps range for small in - plane momentum excitons .",
    "these lifetimes are almost two orders of magnitude shorter than those of 2d excitons in iii - v semiconductor quantum wells  @xcite .",
    "average exciton lifetimes in a thermal ensemble depend linearly on the exciton temperature , as is expected for excitons in 2d  @xcite .",
    "localized excitons exhibit lifetimes that increase with the decrease in the localization length @xmath1 as @xmath2@xmath3 and can exceed a nanosecond for localization lengths smaller than @xmath21 nm . in the case of trions",
    "we find that the radiative lifetimes are in the hundreds of picosecond range and increase with the increase in the trion momentum .",
    "average lifetimes of thermally distributed trions increase with the trion temperature as the trions acquire thermal energy and larger momenta .",
    "we also find that in highly doped samples at low temperatures the average trion lifetimes can become very long because the carrier ( electron or hole ) that is left behind when a trion recombines has difficulty finding an unoccupied state in the band .",
    "our results also show that in many commonly encountered experimental situations the ensemble averaged radiative lifetimes of thermally distributed excitons and trions can be comparable . in the main text of the paper",
    "we have used fermi s golden rule to obtain radiative rates . in the appendix",

    "the exciton lifetime increases with the decrease in the localization length as , @xmath173 when @xmath174 , the exciton wavefunction in momentum space is localized in a region smaller than @xmath168 and the exciton lifetime is essentially the same as that of a free ( unlocalized ) exciton with near - zero momentum .",
    "the results in figure [ fig : ex_lifetime_loc ] are quantitatively valid only if @xmath1 is larger than the exciton radius ( @xmath21 nm ) otherwise the relative wavefunction of the exciton state would also change as a result of localization - an effect we have ignored .    in a mos@xmath0 monolayer , @xmath175 .",
    "this means that the relevant length scale against which to compare @xmath1 is @xmath2100 nm .",
    "the temperature dependence of the exciton radiative lifetime measured in experiments will depend on the nature of localization .",
    "for example , if all the excitons are strongly localized , and remain localized as the temperature is increased , then no particular temperature dependence of the average radiative lifetime is expected  @xcite .",
    "the short lifetimes of weakly localized excitons in figure [ fig : ex_lifetime_loc ] for @xmath176 ( or @xmath177 nm in mos@xmath0 ) , may not be observed in experiments as the energy level spacings in such large localizing regions are likely to be small and the excitons could occupy higher energy levels after gaining thermal energy and their ensemble averaged lifetime would then exhibit the characteristics of free excitons .",
    "in this paper , we presented radiative lifetimes of excitons and trions in mos@xmath0 monolayers .",
    "the analysis presented here is also applicable to excitons and trions in other metal dichalcogenides since the optical material properties of sulfides and selenides of molybdenum and tungsten relevant to the radiative lifetimes of excitons and trions are not too different .",
    "recent experimental results on the lifetimes of near - zero momentum excitons in wse@xmath0 monolayer have yielded numbers in the 150 - 250 fs range  @xcite in good agreement with the numbers calculated in this paper for mos@xmath0 ( figure [ fig : ex_lifetime ] ) .",
    "in addition , very long ( @xmath1781 ns ) average exciton lifetimes have also been observed in clean mos@xmath0 monolayers at very small photoexcited exciton densities  @xcite .",
    "these long lifetime values are consistent with strongly localized excitons ( figure [ fig : ex_lifetime_loc ] ) .    some caution must be exercised in interpreting the results presented in this paper .",
    "first , given the extremely short radiative lifetimes of near - zero momentum free excitons ( figure [ fig : ex_lifetime ] ) , the assumption of a thermal ensemble for free excitons might not be relevant to experiments .",
    "it is likely that the average radiative lifetimes of free excitons observed in experiments are determined by the energy relaxation rates of excitons or by assisted processes , such as phonon and impurity scattering , which would provide the momentum necessary for excitons with large in - plane momentum to radiate .",
    "second , in real samples the excitons might become localized at low temperatures . in this case , as the temperature is lowered , the observed average radiative lifetime of the excitons would decrease linearly with the temperature at high temperatures and become weakly dependent on the temperature at low temperatures .",
    "third , our analysis of the trion radiative lifetimes did not take into account the fact that trions are more likely to form in the first place when the doping density is large and , therefore , experimentally observed trion photoluminescence quantum efficiencies at different doping densities might not reflect the trends in trion lifetimes with doping depicted in figures [ fig : tr_lifetime ] and [ fig : tr_lifetime_2 ] .",
    "in fact , a better understanding of the formation dynamics of both excitons and trions would be needed in addition to the results presented here in order to correctly interpret photoluminescence data  @xcite .",

    "the latter corresponds to the radiative lifetime of the exciton .",
    "the situation is reversed when @xmath202 and then the magnitude of the real part of the self - energy becomes large and the imaginary part vanishes .",
    "therefore , when @xmath203 ( inside the light cone ) one can ignore corrections to the exciton dispersion from dipole - dipole interactions , and the lifetime of the exciton can be related to the imaginary part of the self - energy evaluated on the shell , @xmath204 and , we get , @xmath205 the expression for the radiative rate given in the main text in ( [ eq : ex_tau_2 ] ) , in the limit @xmath206 , is exactly equal to the average of the longitudinal and transverse radiative rates given above .",
    "this is because an exciton state belonging to only one valley is an equal superposition state of longitudinal and transverse excitons .",

    "after the completion of this work , we became aware that gartstein et  al .",
    "@xcite have also reached a similar conclusion .",
    "the green s function approach can also be used to find the average lifetime of a thermally distributed ensemble of excitons .",
    "the technique used below also incorporates , via the exciton spectral density function , exciton energy level broadening due to scattering processes .",
    "we define the exciton green s function @xmath211 as follows  @xcite , @xmath212 the angular brackets indicate averaging with respect to a thermal ensemble of excitons . in the frequency domain",

    "since we are considering a resonant linear optical process , the interaction hamiltonian given in ( [ eq : light_h2 ] ) or ( [ eq : light_h3 ] ) is adequate .",

    "the result is , @xmath222 \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\\\ ] ] the terms appearing inside the integral can be partitioned into appropriate radiation and exciton green s functions .",
    "if one uses the following phenomenological form for the exciton spectral density function , @xmath223 then the final result can be written as , @xmath224 the ensemble average lifetime @xmath124 is then ( see ( [ eq : ensemble ] ) ) , @xmath225 note that in ( [ eq : ex_tau_3 ] ) the boson occupation factor is evaluated at the photon energy and not at the exciton energy .",
    "this subtlety could have been missed if the exciton radiative rate given earlier in ( [ eq : ex_tau_2 ] ) is averaged over the exciton density of states with a boson occupation factor evaluated at the exciton energy .",
    "also note that the exciton density needs to be evaluated self - consistently using the same spectral density function .",
    "since for bosons the chemical potential must always be less than or equal to the lowest energy level , use of phenomenological lorentzian spectral density functions can lead to problems during numerical calculations .",
    "a way around this problem is to use a spectral density function with tails that decay much faster than the tails of a lorentzian and then the results for the radiative lifetimes do not depend sensitively on the exact form of the spectral density function .",
    "the result obtained using ( [ eq : tsp_app ] ) is given in ( [ eq : ensemble ] ) .",

    "@xcite in the case of iii - v quantum well excitons .",
