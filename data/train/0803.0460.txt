    "we only need the second case of the lemma , but we also state the first case for the sake of completeness .    [ ftchar ] let @xmath3 be distinct points in a finite - dimensional normed space @xmath15 .    1 .",

    "taking norms we obtain @xmath124 , and therefore , @xmath125 .",
    "similarly , @xmath126 .",
    "so we already have @xmath127 .",
    "if furthermore @xmath128 , we also obtain @xmath129 , giving @xmath130 .    in the remaining case",
    "@xmath131 we write @xmath132 as a non - negative linear combination @xmath133 and apply the triangle inequality : @xmath134    [ euclonlinelemma ] let @xmath107 be vectors in the euclidean plane such that @xmath135 , @xmath109 .",

    "it would be interesting to find higher dimensional generalizations of our results and methods .",
    "we only make the following remarks .",
    "perhaps there is an analogue of theorem  [ oddunitvectors ] with an upper bound of @xmath160 for @xmath51 unit vectors in a @xmath19-dimensional normed space where @xmath161 .",
    "this would be best possible , as the standard unit vectors in the @xmath19-dimensional space with the @xmath162 norm show .    regarding theorem  [ thmtwo ] ,",
    "it is not even clear what the best upper bound in theorem  [ bgtwo ] should be . brny and grinberg @xcite claim that they can replace @xmath163 by @xmath164 . on the other hand , the upper bound can not be smaller than @xmath19 , as the @xmath19-dimensional @xmath162 space shows @xcite . as the negative part of theorem  [ gametheorem ] and",
    "the results of @xcite show , an online method would have to have a ( sufficiently large ) buffer where player ii can put vectors supplied by player i and take them out in any order .",
    "we finally remark that a naive generalization of theorem  [ ftresult ] is not possible , even in euclidean @xmath165-space . for example , using lemma  [ ftchar ] it can be shown that for a regular simplex with vertices @xmath166 there exists a point @xmath167 in the interior of the simplex such that @xmath167 is not a fermat - toricelli point of @xmath168  we may take any @xmath167 sufficiently near a vertex .",
