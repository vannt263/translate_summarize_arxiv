    "one of the most important question raised after the discovery of high - tc superconductivity is whether a simple model of strongly correlated electrons can capture the low - energy physics of real materials . in particular",
    "it is still a very much debated issue whether a purely repulsive electronic interaction can give rise to a d - wave superconducting ground state by doping an antiferromagnetic mott insulator with a small amount of holes .",
    "the simplest model that has been proposed immediately after the discovery of high - tc superconductors is the @xmath0 model @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the electron density on site @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the spin operator and @xmath14 are pauli matrices . in the following we put @xmath15 .",
    "after many years of intense numerical and theoretical efforts there is no general consensus on the properties of this simple hamiltonian and of the related hubbard model . from the numerical point of view",
    ", the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite predicts that a charge density wave instability @xcite , nowadays called _ striped - phase _ for its one dimensional character , is strongly competing with pairing and superconductivity @xcite . within dmrg",
    "it appears therefore difficult to explain copper - oxide superconductors with a simple one - band model , especially because , in order to be consistent with photoemission experiments @xcite , a negative next - nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath16 has to be included in the model .",
    "in fact , the negative @xmath16 suppresses even further superconductivity , so that the @xmath0 model becomes unrealistic to describe the low - energy physics of high - tc superconductors . however , the dmrg results , though quite accurate , are not exact in two dimensions .",
    "moreover , for technical reasons it is possible to consider only particular boundary conditions ( open in one direction and periodic in the other ) , which certainly make the dmrg calculation still far to be representative of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) is an appealing alternative numerical approach .",
    "this numerical method is still severely limited for two - dimensional fermionic systems by the well - known _ sign problem _ and is consequently biased by the initial guess of the ground state used to control this numerical instability @xcite .",
    "however this technique has the important advantage to work very well with periodic boundary conditions since translation invariance can be explicitly used to improve the efficiency of qmc algorithms . in particular , an approximate ground state can be obtained starting from a translation invariant wavefunction @xmath17 by applying exactly few powers of the hamiltonian @xmath18 @xcite or many approximate ones ( by using for instance the _ fixed - node _ fn approximation @xcite ) .",
    "however , within various qmc schemes the situation is still controversial .",
    "first heeb @xcite and khono @xcite have found d - wave superconductivity in a reasonable parameter range .",
    "later shih and _ co - workers _",
    "@xcite , using a very similar method , have excluded drastically this possibility .",
    "the latter results were obtained within the monotonic - behavior assumption of the off - diagonal superconducting order parameter as a function of the number @xmath7 of hamiltonian powers applied to the initial wavefunction .",
    "this assumption , although reasonable , is highly questionable .",
    "by contrast , in a recent qmc work @xcite , a clear tendency to d - wave superconductivity in the @xmath0 model was found .",
    "moreover , very recently , an almost realistic phase diagram with a corresponding high - tc d - wave superconducting transition has been obtained for the hubbard model within the dynamical mean field approximation @xcite . furthermore , in the contest of the hubbard model ,",
    "also a weak - coupling renormalization group approach @xcite gives rise to a d - wave order parameter in a large region of the phase diagram .",
    "the latter results strongly support the relevance of a single band model for the explanation of high - tc superconductivity .",
    "in this work we make a further attempt to clarify the controversial numerical findings on the issue of d - wave superconductivity in the @xmath0 model , using the statistical _ few lanczos - step technique _ ( flst ) , efficiently implemented by means of the stochastic reconfiguration ( sr ) @xcite . within the latter scheme",
    "all kind of correlation functions can be computed efficiently without any _ mixed average _",
    "@xcite approximation : an enormous advantage compared to the fn or to the original sr technique @xcite . in these cases",
    "this bias can be removed at the price of adding a small field coupled to the desired correlation function @xcite . however , it turns out that it is extremely difficult and computationally demanding to work in the small field limit when unbiased correlation functions can be obtained .",
    "flst is instead a very good compromise that solves efficiently this numerical problem of qmc methods .",
    "the wavefunctions that we are able to sample statistically read : @xmath19 minimizing the energy expectation value @xmath20 .",
    "for any @xmath7 it is simple to show that the wavefunction ( [ psig ] ) corresponds exactly to apply @xmath7 lanczos step iterations to the initial wavefunction @xmath17 .",
    "this wavefunction is sampled statistically with the sr technique , by using in the reconfiguration scheme the first @xmath7 powers of the hamiltonian . unlike the previous method @xcite the reference wavefunction @xmath21 is not evolved during the markov iteration .",
    "@xmath21 is instead kept statistically equal to the initial wavefunction @xmath17 using the variational scheme proposed by hellberg and manousakis @xcite , which highly reduce the statistical fluctuations related to the sr technique .",
    "the equivalence of flst to the standard lanczos algorithm will be discussed in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the initial wavefunction to which flst will be applied can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath22 is a bcs wavefunction , which is an exact eigenstate of the following hamiltonian : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the free electron tight binding nearest - neighbor hamiltonian , @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the free - electron chemical potential and @xmath27 creates all possible nearest - neighbor singlet bonds with d - wave symmetry being @xmath28 @xmath29 or @xmath30 if the bond @xmath31 is in the @xmath32 or @xmath33 direction , respectively . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the projectors over the subspaces with a fixed number @xmath36 of particles and no doubly occupied states .",
    "finally the jastrow factor @xmath37 couples the holes via the density operators @xmath38 and contains another variational parameter @xmath39 which scales an exact analytic form , obtained by approximating the holes with hard - core bosons at the same density , and applying the spin - wave theory to the corresponding @xmath40 model @xcite .",
    "we note here that by performing a particle - hole transformation on the spin down @xmath41 , the ground state of the bcs hamiltonian is just a slater - determinant with @xmath42 particles @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why this variational wavefunction can be considered of the generic jastrow - slater form , a standard variational wavefunction used in qmc . using the particle - hole transformation ,",
    "it is also possible to control exactly the spurious finite system divergences related to the nodes of the d - wave order parameter .",
    "in this section we show the accuracy of flst applied to the bcs wavefunction ( [ gros ] ) on a small 18-site cluster , where exact results are available .",
    "our main task is to compute the order parameter at finite system size @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the states with @xmath36 and @xmath46 particles , respectively .",
    "if @xmath4 is finite in the thermodynamic limit this necessarily implies off - diagonal long - range order in the ground state . following ref .",
    "@xcite , it is convenient with an approximate technique to calculate a short - range quantity like @xmath4 , instead of the more conventional long - range expectation value @xmath47 . in table",
    "[ tone ] we show a comparison between flst and the exact results for 18 and 16 electrons at @xmath48 .    in table [ ttwo ] we show @xmath4 as a function of the number of lanczos step iterations for the 18-site cluster at @xmath48 . in the same table we have computed also the variance @xmath49 , the overlap squared @xmath50 of the flst wavefunction with the true ground state @xmath51 , and the average sign of the flst wavefunction : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes configurations with definite electron positions and spins . for an exact calculation , namely @xmath54 , both @xmath55 and @xmath56 , whereas @xmath57 .",
    "the variance thus represents a very important tool to estimate the ` distance ' from the exact ground state when the latter one is not known . in particular whenever @xmath58 the energy approaches the exact result linearly with the variance @xmath59 , allowing us to estimate the error in the variational energy .",
    ".comparison between the estimates of the ground - state energy per site @xmath60 and of the d - wave order parameter @xmath4 obtained with the exact and the statistical ( flst ) application of @xmath7 lanczos steps on the variational wavefunction of eq .",
    "( [ gros ] ) .",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath61 and @xmath48 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this can be achieved by plotting the variational energies @xmath62 as a function of the corresponding variance @xmath59 , and performing a very stable linear or quadratic fit to the @xmath63 exact limit ( see fig .",
    "[ ergpd18 ] ) .",
    "similar fits can be attempted for correlation functions though , in this case , also a term @xmath64 is expected for @xmath65 .",
    "this term is however negligible for quantities like @xmath4 that are averaged bulk correlation functions in a large system size ( see the appendix ) . in practice even in the small 18-site cluster",
    "the non - linear term turns out to be negligible ( see fig .  [ ergpd18 ] ) .",
    "we believe that , being the convergence of the lanczos algorithm particularly well behaved and certainly unbiased , the variance extrapolation method is in this case particularly useful and reliable .",
    "however for bad initial wavefunction ( e.g. , randomly generated ) or very large sizes the approach to zero of the variance may behave rather wildly , requiring many lanczos steps to reach the regime where the extrapolation is possible .",
    "as shown in table [ ttwo ] the quality of the variational bcs wavefunction ( [ psig ] ) is _ exceptionally good _ , especially in the doped @xmath66 case . here",
    "@xmath67 is larger than @xmath68 even at the simplest @xmath69 variational level , and is drastically improved with really few lanczos step iterations .",
    "remarkable is also the behavior of the average sign @xmath70 which measures directly the accuracy of the bcs wavefunction phases , without caring about the amplitudes . in the undoped case",
    "the signs of the bcs wavefunction @xmath71 can be proven to be exact , i.e. , @xmath72 , having the bcs state the well - known marshall signs , i.e. , the phases of the exact ground state of heisenberg model .",
    "for the two - hole case , the bcs nodes change in a non trivial way .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath71 remains very close to @xmath73 and it is much higher than the average sign of the corresponding gutzwiller wavefunction ( @xmath74 ) , also shown in the table for comparison .",
    "these results suggest that there is a tendency to d - wave bcs pairing in the @xmath0 model at @xmath75 doping and @xmath76 , and that the bcs wavefunction is a particularly accurate wavefunction to describe the small and even zero doping region of the @xmath0 model .",
    "though few lanczos steps may appear inadequate for large system size , this simple scheme is instead providing us very good variational energies up to @xmath77 sites in the @xmath0 model , even when this variational energies are compared with more complicated schemes like the fn . in order to show that the lanczos scheme remains effective for larger sizes it is useful to consider first a relevant case where a numerically exact solution is possible : the zero doping limit of the @xmath0 model , i.e. , the heisenberg model . in fig .",
    "[ figcav ] we plot the energy results calculated for few lanczos steps as a function of the variance .",
    "the fact that the energy is approaching the exact result smoothly with the variance both in the 50- and 98-site clusters ( with a slightly larger curvature in the latter case ) indicates that the projected bcs wavefunction should have a substantially large overlap squared @xmath67 with the exact ground state of the heisenberg model even on these large system sizes .",
    "this is also confirmed by the behavior of the square order parameter ( fig .",
    "[ figcavm ] ) , which is considerably improved by few lanczos steps .",
    "this result is particularly important since the starting bcs wavefunction has not antiferromagnetic long - range order , whereas the two - dimensional heisenberg model is widely believed to be antiferromagnetically ordered .",
    "the above test represents also a further strong evidence that the ground - state wavefunction of the heisenberg model is smoothly connected to a d - wave bcs superconducting wavefunction .",
    "this circumstance represents a very interesting numerical fact that clearly supports the experimental observation of high - tc d - wave superconductivity coming just upon a small doping of a quantum antiferromagnet .    within the lanczos approximate states",
    "@xmath78 ( @xmath6 ) acting on the best variational bcs wavefunction , we have performed a finite - size scaling of the order parameter @xmath4 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ pd ] ) , at a fixed doping @xmath79 ( corresponding to @xmath80 on the largest size @xmath81 ) . since",
    "@xmath4 is computed between two states with @xmath36 and @xmath46 particle numbers , we assume that it refers to the intermediate doping @xmath82 . for smaller sizes the doping @xmath79 is not possible and we have interpolated linearly @xmath4 between the two fillings closest to this doping . the main results of this paper is then shown in the fig .",
    "[ figpd ] . here",
    "the size scaling for @xmath6 lanczos steps and for their zero - variance extrapolation clearly indicates a finite @xmath4 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the stability of the bcs variational wavefunction is evident from this figure : @xmath4 remains much larger than the corresponding value of the gutzwiller ( @xmath74 ) metallic state .",
    "instead , as shown in fig .",
    "[ edoped ] and similarly to the undoped case , the energy is very much lowered by flst , suggesting that the method remains effective even for large sizes and finite doping .",
    "in conclusion we have provided evidences in favor of the stability of d - wave pairing correlations in the @xmath0 model .",
    "our result disagrees with a recent qmc calculation @xcite , for which , however , the self - consistent assumption mentioned in the introduction leads to a very poor , high - energy variational state .",
    "furthermore , also the dmrg results provide a qualitatively different scenario , namely that stripes suppress d - wave superconductivity @xcite . in order to clarify this disagreement ,",
    "we have performed a simulation at @xmath48 for a cluster with @xmath83 , 8 holes , and open boundary conditions on the long direction , as usually done within dmrg .",
    "our accuracy is in this case worse than with periodic boundary condition , especially for quantities that are not bulk average correlation functions ( see the appendix ) . for @xmath4 instead",
    "we have found that , even at the simplest variational level open boundary conditions strongly suppress @xmath4 by more than @xmath84 , much more than the difference found in fig .",
    "( [ figpd ] ) .",
    "thus we find that boundary conditions play a very important role and may strongly destabilize the uniform bcs d - wave ground state , as obtained within dmrg .",
    "this is consistent with experimental findings @xcite , showing that any small asymmetry in the cuo planes , acting in our point of view as a distorted boundary condition , may enhance the tendency to stripe formation and then suppressing superconductivity .",
    "our results instead support the recent numerical works @xcite , indicating that d - wave superconductivity can be obtained in a one band model with repulsive electron interaction .    in this appendix",
    "we estimate the error on correlation functions assuming that the ground state @xmath51 is approximated with the wavefunction @xmath85 : @xmath86 , and @xmath87 represents a normalized wavefunction orthogonal to the exact one , @xmath88 .",
    "we restrict our analysis to thermodynamically averaged correlation functions @xmath89 , the ones which can be written as a bulk average of local operators @xmath90 : @xmath91 .",
    "this class of operators includes for instance the average kinetic or potential energy or the spin - spin correlation function at a given distance @xmath92 , namely @xmath93 .",
    "if we use periodic boundary conditions the expectation value of @xmath90 on a state with given momentum does not depend on @xmath12 and the bulk average does not represents an approximation @xmath94 we show here that the expectation value of bulk - averaged operators @xmath89 on the approximate state @xmath78 satisfy the following relation : @xmath95 thus implying that for large enough size the expectation value ( [ approx ] ) approaches the exact correlation function @xmath96 linearly with the variance .",
    "the validity of the above statement is very simple to show under very general grounds .",
    "in fact by definition : @xmath97 the term proportional to @xmath98 in the above equation can be easily bounded by use of the schwartz inequality : @xmath99 the final term in the latter inequality can be estimated under the general assumption that correlation functions @xmath100 decay sufficiently fast with the distance @xmath101 , as a consequence of the cluster property : @xmath102 this concludes the proof of the statement of this appendix , provided @xmath103 is finite for @xmath104 .",
