    "strictly speaking , black holes do not exist .",
    "actually , holes , of any kind , do not exist .",
    "you can talk about holes of course .",
    "for instance you can say : `` there is a hole in the wall ''",
    ". you can give many details of the hole : it is big , it is round shaped , light comes in through it , even perhaps the hole could be such that you can go through to the outside .",
    "but i am sure that you do not think that there is a thing made out of nothingness in the wall .",
    "no . to talk about",
    "the hole is actually an indirect way of talking about the wall .",
    "what really exists is the wall .",
    "the wall is made out of bricks , atoms , protons and leptons , whatever .",
    "to say that there is a hole in the wall is just to say that the wall has a certain topology , a topology such that not every closed curve on the surface of the wall can be contracted to a single point .",
    "the hole is not a thing .",
    "the hole is a property of the wall .",
    "let us come back to black holes .",
    "what are we talking about when we talk about black holes ? .",
    "_ spacetime_. ok , but what is spacetime ? .",
    "_ spacetime is the set of all events of all things_. everything that has happened , everything that happens , everything that will happen , is just an element , a `` point '' , of spacetime .",
    "spacetime is not a thing , it is just the way we represent the relations among all things .    as with every set",
    ", we can equip spacetime with some mathematical structure , in order to describe it .",
    "we shall adopt the following mathematical structure for spacetime : + _ spacetime is represented by a differentiable , 4-dimensional , real manifold . _",
    "+ a real 4-d manifold is a set that can be covered completely by subsets whose elements are in a one - to - one correspondence with subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "each element of the manifold represents an event .",
    "we adopt 4 dimensions because it seems enough to give 4 real numbers to localize an event .",
    "for instance , a lightning has beaten the top of the building , located in the corner of streets 115 and 46 , at 25 m above the see level , la plata city , at 4.35 am , local time , march 2nd , 2008 ( this is my home , by the way ) .",
    "we see now why we choose a manifold to represent spacetime : we can always provide a set of 4 real numbers for every event , and this can be done independently of the geometric structure of the manifold .",
    "if there is more than a single characterization of an event , we can always find a transformation law between the different coordinate systems .",
    "this is a basic property of manifolds .",
    "now , if we want to calculate distances between two events is spacetime , we need more structure on our manifold : we need a geometric structure",
    ". we can do this introducing a metric tensor that tell us how to calculate distances . for instance , consider an euclidean metric tensor @xmath1 ( indices run from 0 to 3 ) :    @xmath2    then , adopting the einstein convention of sum , we have that the distance @xmath3 between two arbitrarily close events is : @xmath4 restricted to 3 coordinates , this is the way distances have been calculated since pythagoras .",
    "however , the world seems to be a little more complicated .",
    "after the introduction of the special theory of relativity by einstein ( 1905 ) , the german mathematician hermann minkowski introduced the following pseudo - euclidean metric which is consistent with einstein s theory ( minkowski 1907 ) :    @xmath5    notice that the minkowski metric tensor @xmath6 has rank 2 and trace @xmath7 .",
    "we call the coordinates with the same sign _ spatial _ ( adopting the convention @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) and the coordinate @xmath11 is called _ temporal coordinate_. the constant @xmath12",
    "is introduced to make uniform the units .",
    "there is an important fact respect to eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) : contrary to what was thought by kant and others , it is not a necessary statement .",
    "things might have been different .",
    "we can easily imagine possible worlds with other metrics .",
    "this means that the metric tensor has empirical information about the real universe .",
    "once we have introduced a metric tensor we can separate spacetime at each point in three regions according to @xmath13 ( space - like region ) , @xmath14 ( light - like or null region ) , and @xmath15 ( time - like region ) .",
    "particles that go through the origin can only reach time - like regions .",
    "the null surface @xmath14 can be inhabited only by particles moving at the speed of light , like photons .",
    "points in the space - like region can not been reached by material objects from the origin of the _ light cone _ that can be formed at any spacetime point .",
    "notice that the introduction of the metric allows to define the future and the past of a given event .",
    "let us consider the unitary vector @xmath16 , then a vector @xmath17 points to the future if @xmath18 .",
    "in the similar way , the vector points toward the past if @xmath19 . a light cone",
    "is shown in figure [ cone ] .",
    "we define the _ proper time _ ( @xmath20 ) of a physical system as the time of a co - moving system , i.e. @xmath21 , and hence : @xmath22 since the interval is an invariant ( i.e. it has the same value in all coordinate systems ) , it is easy to show that : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lorentz factor of the system .",
    "a basic characteristic of minskowski spacetime is that it is `` flat '' : all light cones point in the same direction , i.e. the local direction of the future does not depend on the coefficients of the metric since these are constants .",
    "more general spacetimes are possible .",
    "if we want to describe gravity in the framework of spacetime , we have to introduce a riemannian spacetime , whose metric can be flexible , i.e. a function of the material properties ( mass - energy and momentum ) of the physical systems that produce the events of spacetime .    in order to introduce gravitation in a general spacetime , we define a metric tensor @xmath25 , such as its components can be related to those of a locally minkowski spacetime defined by @xmath26 through a general transformation : @xmath27    in the absence of gravity we can always find a global coordinate system ( @xmath28 ) for which the metric can take the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eta ] ) everywhere . with gravity , on the contrary ,",
    "such a coordinate system can represent spacetime only in an infinitesimal neighborhood of a given point .",
    "this situation is represented in fig [ flat ] , where the tangent flat space to a point p of the manifold is shown .",
    "the equation of motion of a free particle ( i.e. only subject to gravity ) in a general spacetime of metric @xmath25 is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the affine connection of the manifold , which is expressed in terms of derivatives of the metric tensor :    @xmath31    here we use the convention : @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "notice that under a coordinate transformation from @xmath17 to @xmath34 the affine connection is not transformed as a tensor , despite that the metric @xmath25 is a tensor of second rank .    in a riemannian spacetime",
    "the usual partial derivative is not a meaningful quantity since we can give it different values through different choices of coordinates .",
    "we can define a covariant differentiation through the condition of parallel transport : @xmath35 in this way , a tangent vector satisfies @xmath36 .",
    "if there is a vector @xmath37 pointing in the direction of a symmetry of spacetime , then it can be shown ( e.g. weinberg 1972 ) : @xmath38 this equation is called killing s equation .",
    "a vector field @xmath37 satisfying such a relation is called a killing vector .    from eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) we can recover the classical newtonian equations if : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the newtonian gravitational potential . then : @xmath42 @xmath43 we see , then , that the metric represents the gravitational potential and the affine connection the gravitational field .",
    "the presence of gravity is indicated by the curvature of spacetime .",
    "the riemann tensor , or curvature tensor , provides a measure of this curvature : @xmath44 the ricci tensor is defined by : @xmath45 finally , the ricci scalar is @xmath46 .",
    "the key issue to determine the geometric structure of spacetime , and hence to specify the effects of gravity , is to find the law that fixes the metric once the source of the gravitational field is given .",
    "the source of the gravitational field is the energy - momentum tensor @xmath47 that represents the physical properties of a material thing .",
    "for the simple case of a perfect fluid the energy - momentum tensor takes the form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mass - energy density , @xmath50 is the pressure , and @xmath51 is the 4-velocity .",
    "the field equations were found by einstein ( 1915 ) and independently by hilbert ( 1915 ) on november 25th and 20th , 1915 , respectively .",
    "these equations can be written in the simple form : @xmath52 this is a set of ten non - linear partial differential equations for the metric coefficients .",
    "the set of equations is not unique : we can add any constant multiple of @xmath25 to the left member of ( [ einstein ] ) and still obtain a _",
    "consistent _ set of equations .",
    "it is usual to denote this multiple by @xmath53 , so the field equations can also be written as : @xmath54 lambda is a new universal constant called , because of historical reasons , the _ cosmological constant_. if we consider some kind of `` substance '' with equation of state given by @xmath55 , then its energy - momentum tensor would be : @xmath56 notice that the energy - momentum tensor of this substance depends only on the spacetime metric @xmath25 , hence it describes a property of the `` vacuum '' itself .",
    "we can call @xmath57 the energy density of the vacuum field . then , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) as : @xmath58 in such a way that @xmath59 there is evidence ( e.g. perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) that the energy density of the vacuum is different from zero .",
    "this means that @xmath53 is small , but not zero .",
    "the negative pressure seems to be driving a `` cosmic acceleration '' .",
    "the conservation of mass - energy and momentum can be derived from the field equations : @xmath60    despite the complexity of einstein s field equations a large number of exact solutions have been found .",
    "they are usually obtained imposing symmetries on the spacetime in such a way that the metric coefficients can be found . the first and most general solution to eqs .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) was obtained by karl schwarszchild in 1916 , short before he died in the eastern front of world war i. this solution , as we will see , describes a non - rotating black hole of mass @xmath61 .",
    "the schwarzschild solution for a static mass @xmath61 can be written in spherical coordinates @xmath62 as : @xmath63 this solution corresponds to the vacuum region exterior to the spherical object of mass @xmath61 . inside the object ,",
    "spacetime will depend on the peculiarities of the physical object .",
    "the metric given by eq .",
    "( [ schw ] ) has some interesting properties .",
    "let s assume that the mass @xmath61 is concentrated at @xmath64 .",
    "there seems to be two singularities at which the metric diverges : one at @xmath64 and the other at @xmath65 @xmath66 is know as the _ schwarzschild radius_. if the object of mass @xmath61 is macroscopic , then @xmath66 is inside it , and the solution does not apply . for instance , for the sun @xmath67 km .",
    "however , for a point mass , the schwarzschild radius is in the vacuum region and spacetime has the structure given by ( [ schw ] ) . in general",
    ", we can write : @xmath68    it is easy to see that strange things occur close to @xmath69 .",
    "for instance , the , for the proper time we get : @xmath70 when @xmath71 both times agree , so @xmath72 is interpreted as the proper time measure from an infinite distance . as the system with",
    "proper time @xmath20 approaches to @xmath69 , @xmath73 tends to infinity according to eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) .",
    "the object never reaches the schwarszchild surface when seen by an infinitely distant observer .",
    "the closer the object is to the schwarzschild radius , the slower it moves for the external observer .",
    "a direct consequence of the difference introduced by gravity in the local time respect to the time of an observer at infinity is that the radiation that escapes from a given @xmath74 will be redshifted when received by a distant and static observer . since the frequency ( and hence the energy ) of the photon depend of the time interval , we can write , from eq .",
    "( [ time ] ) : @xmath75 since the redshift is : @xmath76 then @xmath77 and we see that when @xmath78 the redshift becomes infinite .",
    "this means that a photon needs infinite energy to escape from inside the region determined by @xmath66 .",
    "events that occur at @xmath79 are disconnected from the rest of the universe .",
    "hence , we call the surface determined by @xmath80 an _ event horizon_. whatever crosses the event horizon will never return .",
    "this is the origin of the expression `` black hole '' , introduced by john a. wheeler in the mid 1960s .",
    "the black hole is the region of spacetime inside the event horizon .    what happens to an object when it crosses the event horizon ?",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ schw ] ) , there is a singularity at @xmath80 .",
    "however , the metric coefficients can be made regular by a change of coordinates .",
    "for instance we can consider eddington - finkelstein coordinates .",
    "let us define a new radial coordinate @xmath81 such that radial null rays satisfy @xmath82 .",
    "( [ schw ] ) it can be shown that : @xmath83 then , we introduce : @xmath84 the new coordinate @xmath85 can be used as a time coordinate replacing @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ schw ] ) .",
    "this yields : @xmath86 or @xmath87 where @xmath88    notice that in eq .",
    "( [ ef ] ) the metric is non - singular at @xmath89 .",
    "the only real singularity is at @xmath64 , since there the riemann tensor diverges . in order to plot the spacetime in a @xmath90-plane",
    ", we can introduce a new time coordinate @xmath91 . from the metric ( [ ef ] ) or from fig .",
    "[ falling ] we see that the line @xmath80 , @xmath92constant , and @xmath93 constant is a null ray , and hence , the surface at @xmath80 is a null surface .",
    "this null surface is an event horizon because inside @xmath80 all cones have @xmath64 in there future .",
    "the object in @xmath64 is the source of the gravitational field and is called _ the singularity_. we will say more about it in sect . [ sing ] for the moment , we only remark that everything that crosses the event horizon will end at the singularity .",
    "this is the inescapable fate .",
    "there is no way to avoid it : in the future of every event inside the event horizon is the singularity .",
    "there is no escape , no hope , no freedom , inside the black hole .",
    "there is just the singularity , whatever such a thing might be .",
    "we see now that the name `` black hole '' is not strictly correct for spacetime regions isolated by event horizons .",
    "there is no hole to other place .",
    "what falls into the black hole , goes to the singularity .",
    "the singularity increases its mass and energy , and then the event horizon grows .",
    "this would not happen if what falls into the hole were able to pass through , like through a hole in the wall .",
    "a black hole is more like a spacetime precipice , deep , deadly , and with something unknown at the bottom .",
    "orbits around a schwazschild black hole can be easily calculated using the metric and the relevant symmetries ( see .",
    "e.g. raine and thomas 2005 ) . for circular orbits of a massive particle",
    "we have the conditions @xmath94 the orbits are possible only at the turning points of the effective potential : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the angular momentum in units of @xmath97 and @xmath98 the gravitational radius",
    ". then , @xmath99 for @xmath100 there are two solutions .",
    "the negative sign corresponds to a maximum of the potential and is unstable , and the positive sign corresponds to minimum , which is stable . at @xmath101 there is a single stable orbit .",
    "it is the innermost marginally stable orbit , and it occurs at @xmath102 .",
    "the specific angular momentum of a particle in a circular orbit is : @xmath103 its energy ( units of @xmath104 ) is : @xmath105 the proper and observer s periods are : @xmath106 and @xmath107 notice that when @xmath108 both @xmath96 and @xmath109 tend to infinity , so only massless particles can orbit at such a radius .",
    "the local velocity at @xmath110 of an object falling from rest to the black hole is ( e.g. raine and thomas 2005 ) : @xmath111 then , the differential acceleration the object will experience along an element @xmath112 is . ] : @xmath113 the tidal acceleration on a body of finite size @xmath114 is simply @xmath115 .",
    "this acceleration and the corresponding force becomes infinite at the singularity .",
    "as the object falls into the black hole , tidal forces act to tear it apart .",
    "this painful process is known as `` spaghettification '' .",
    "the process can be significant long before crossing the event horizon , depending on the mass of the black hole .",
    "the energy of a particle in the innermost stable orbit can be obtained from the above equation for the energy setting @xmath116 .",
    "this yields : @xmath117 since a particle at rest at infinity has @xmath118 , then the energy that the particle should release to fall into the black hole is @xmath119 .",
    "this means 5.7 % of its rest mass energy , significantly higher than the energy release that can be achieved through nuclear fusion .",
    "an interesting question we can make is what is the gravitational acceleration at the event horizon as seen by an observer from infinity .",
    "the acceleration relative to a hovering frame system of a freely falling object at rest at @xmath110 is ( raine and thomas 2005 ) : @xmath120 so , the energy spent to move the object a distance @xmath121 will be @xmath122",
    ". the energy expended respect to a frame at infinity is @xmath123 .",
    "because of the conservation of energy , both quantities should be related by a redshift factor : @xmath124 hence , using the expression for @xmath125 we get : @xmath126 notice that for an observer at @xmath110 , @xmath127 when @xmath78 .",
    "however , from infinity the required force to hold the object hovering at the horizon is : @xmath128 this is the _ surface gravity _ of the black hole .",
    "other coordinates can be introduced to study additional properties of black holes .",
    "we refer the reader to the books of frolov and novikov ( 1998 ) and raine and thomas ( 2005 ) for kruskal coordinates and further details .",
    "now , we turn to axially symmetric ( rotating ) solutions of the field equations .",
    "a schwarzschild black hole does not rotate .",
    "the solution of the field equations ( [ einstein ] ) for a rotating body of mass @xmath61 and angular momentum per unit mass @xmath129 was found by roy kerr ( 1963 ) :    @xmath130\\sigma^{-1}\\sin^2\\theta\\\\\\sigma&\\equiv & r^2+a^2 c^{-2}\\cos^2\\theta\\\\\\delta&\\equiv & r^2 - 2gmc^{-2}r+a^2c^{-2}. \\label{kerr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is the kerr metric in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath131 , which reduces to schwarzschild metric for @xmath132 . in boyer - lindquist coordinates the metric is approximately lorentzian at infinity ( i.e. we have a minkowski spacetime in in the usual coordinates of special relativity ) .",
    "note that the element @xmath133 no longer vanishes . even at infinity",
    "this element remains ( hence we wrote _ approximately _ lorentzian above ) .",
    "the kerr parameter @xmath134 has dimensions of length",
    ". the larger the ratio of this scale to @xmath135 ( the _ spin  parameter _",
    "@xmath136 ) , the more aspherical the metric .",

    "a study of the orbits around a kerr black hole is beyond the limits of the present article ( the reader is referred to frolov and novikov 1998 ) , but we will mention several interesting features .",
    "one is that if a particle initially falls radially with no angular momentum from infinity to the black hole , it gains angular motion during the infall .",
    "the angular velocity as seen from a distant observer is : @xmath153 notice that the particle will acquire angular velocity in the direction of the spin of the black hole .",
    "as the black hole is approached , the particle will find an increasing tendency to get carried away in the same sense in which the black hole is rotating . to keep the particle stationary respect the distant stars",
    ", it will be necessary to apply a force against this tendency .",
    "the closer the particle will be to the black hole , the stronger the force . at a point",
    "@xmath154 it becomes impossible to counteract the rotational sweeping force .",
    "the particle is in a kind of spacetime maelstrom .",
    "the the surface determined by @xmath154 is the _",

    "spacetime is rotating here in such a way that you can not do anything in order to not co - rotate .",
    "you can still escape from the black hole , since the outer event horizon has not been crossed , but rotation is inescapable .",
    "the region between the static limit and the event horizon is called the _",
    "ergosphere_. the ergosphere is not spherical but its shape changes with the latitude @xmath155 : @xmath156 the static limit lies outside the horizon except at the poles where both surfaces coincide .",
    "the phenomenon of `` frame dragging'' is common to all axially symmetric metrics with @xmath157    roger penrose ( 1969 ) suggested that a projectile thrown from outside into the ergosphere begins to rotate acquiring more rotational energy than it originally had .",

    "nuclear burning gradually transforms the stellar core from h to he and in the case of massive stars ( @xmath188 ) then to c and finally to fe .",
    "the core contracts in the processes , in order to achieve the ignition of each phase of thermonuclear burning .    finally , the endothermic disintegration of iron - group nuclei , which are those with the tightest bound , precipitates the collapse of the core to a stellar - mass black hole .",
    "stars with masses in the range @xmath189 produce black holes with @xmath190 .",
    "low - mass black holes ( @xmath191 ) can result from the collapse of stars of @xmath192 along with the ejection of the outer layers of the star by a shock wave in an event known as type ii supernova . a similar event , occurring in stars with @xmath193 leaves behind a neutron star . very massive stars with high spin likely end producing a gamma - ray burst and a very massive ( @xmath194 ) black hole .",

    "once the null surface of the light cones points along the time axis the black hole is formed : light rays will never be again able to escape to the outer universe .",
    "if the collapse is not perfectly symmetric , any asymmetry in the resulting black hole is radiated away as gravitational waves , in such a way that the final result is a black hole that is completely characterized by the three parameters @xmath61 , @xmath137 , and @xmath167 . the black hole , then , has no information about the details of the formation process .",

    "when a black hole absorbs a mass @xmath198 , its mass increases to @xmath199 , and hence , the area increases as well . since the horizon can be crossed in just one direction the area of a black hole can only increase .",
    "this suggests an analogy with entropy .",
    "a variation in the entropy of the black hole will be related to the heat ( @xmath200 ) absorbed through the following equation : @xmath201    particles trapped in the black hole will have a wavelength : @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "then , @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a numerical constant .",
    "then , @xmath206    a quantum mechanical calculation of the horizon temperature in the schwarzschild case leads to @xmath207 and hence : @xmath208 we can write then the entropy of the black hole as : @xmath209 the formation of a black hole implies a huge increase of entropy .",
    "just to compare , a solar mass star has an entropy @xmath210 orders of magnitude lower .",
    "this tremendous increase of entropy is related to the loss of information about the original system once the black hole is formed .",
    "the analogy between area and entropy allows to state a set of laws for black holes thermodynamics :    * first law ( energy conservation ) : @xmath211 . here",
    ", @xmath212 is the angular velocity and @xmath213 the electrostatic potential .",
    "* second law ( entropy never decreases ) : in all physical processes involving black holes the total surface area of all the participating black holes can never decrease .",
    "* third law ( nernst s law ) : the temperature ( surface gravity ) of a black black hole can not be zero .",
    "since @xmath214 with @xmath215 for extremal charged and extremal kerr black holes , these are thought to be limit cases that can not be reached in nature . * zeroth law ( thermal equilibrium ) : the surface gravity ( temperature ) is constant over the event horizon of a stationary axially symmetric black hole .",
    "if a temperature can be associated with black holes , then they should radiate as any other body .",
    "the luminosity of a schwarzschild black hole is : @xmath216 here , @xmath217 is the stephan - boltzmann constant .",
    "this expression can be written as : @xmath218 the lifetime of a black hole is : @xmath219 notice that the black hole heats up as it radiates!. this occurs because when the hole radiates , its mass decreases and then according to eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) the temperature must rise .    if nothing can escape from black holes because of the existence of the event horizon , what is the origin of this radiation ? .",
    "the answer , found by hawking ( 1974 ) , is related to quantum effects close to the horizon . according to the heisenberg relation @xmath220 particles",
    "can be created out of the ground state of a quantum field as far as the relation is not violated .",
    "particles must be created in pairs , along a tiny time , in order to satisfy conservation laws other than energy . if a pair is created close to the horizon an one particle crosses it , then the other particle can escape provided its momentum is in the outward direction .",
    "the virtual particle is then transformed into a real particle , at expense of the black hole energy .",
    "the black hole then will lose energy and its area will decrease slowly , violating the second law of thermodynamics",
    ". however , there is no violation if we consider a _ generalized second law _",
    ", that always holds : _ in any process , the total generalized entropy @xmath221 never decreases _ ( bekenstein 1973 ) .",
    "in the real universe black holes are not expected to be isolated , hence the ergosphere should be populated by charged particles .",
    "this plasma would rotate in the same sense as the black hole due to the effects of the frame dragging . a magnetic field will develop and will rotate too , generating a potential drop that might accelerate particles up to relativistic speed and produce a wind along the rotation axis of the hole .",
    "such a picture has been consistently developed by punsly and coroniti ( 1990a , b ) and punsly ( 2001 ) .",
    "blandford and znajek ( 1977 ) developed a general theory of force - free steady - state axisymmetric magnetosphere of a rotating black hole . in an accreting black hole ,",
    "a magnetic field can be sustained by external currents , but as such currents move along the horizon , the field lines are usually representing as originating from the horizon and then being torqued by rotation .",
    "the result is an outgoing electromagnetic flux of energy and momentum .",
    "this picture stimulated the development of the so - called `` membrane paradigm '' by thorne et al .",
    "( 1986 ) where the event horizon is attributed with a set of physical properties .",
    "this model of black hole has been subjected to strong criticism by punsly ( 2001 ) since general relativity implies that the horizon is causally disconnected from the outgoing wind .",
    "recent numerical simulations ( e.g. komissarov 2004 ) show that the key role in the electrodynamic mechanisms of rotating black holes is played by the ergosphere and not by the horizon",

    "general relativity is incomplete in the sense that it can not provide a full description of the gravitational behavior of any physical system .",
    "true singularities are not within the range of values of the bound variables of the theory : they do not belong to the ontology of a world that can be described with 4-dimensional differential manifolds .",
    "singularities do not belong to classical spacetime .",
    "this is not surprising since singularities are extremely compact systems . at such small scales , relations among things",
    "should be described in a quantum mechanical way .",
    "if spacetime is formed by the events that occur to things , it should be represented through quantum mechanic theory when the things are described by a quantum theory .",

    "there are many types of wormhole solutions for the einstein field equations ( see visser 1996 ) .",

    ", we should introduce additional engineering constraints .",
    "notice that for simplicity we have considered both asymptotic regions as interchangeable .",
    "this is the best choice of coordinates for the study of wormhole geometries because calculations result considerably simplified . in general ,",
    "two patches are needed to cover the whole range of @xmath235 , but this is not noticed if both asymptotic regions are assumed similar .",
    "the static line element is :    @xmath242    where the redshift function @xmath213 and the shape - like function @xmath243 characterize the wormhole topology .",
    "they must satisfy :    1 .",
    "@xmath244 throughout the spacetime .",
    "this is required to ensure the finiteness of the proper radial distance defined by @xmath245 .",
    "the @xmath246 signs refer to the two asymptotically flat regions which are connected by the wormhole throat .",
    "2 .   the precise definition of the wormhole s throat ( minimum radius , @xmath247 ) entails a vertical slope of the embedding surface + @xmath248 3 .   as @xmath249 ( or equivalently , @xmath250 ) , @xmath251 and @xmath252",
    "this is the asymptotic flatness condition on the wormhole spacetime .",
    "4 .   @xmath253 needs to be finite throughout the spacetime to ensure the absence of event horizons and singularities .",
    "5 .   finally , the _ flaring out _ condition , that asserts that the inverse of the embedding function @xmath254 must satisfy @xmath255 at or near the throat",
    ". stated mathematically , @xmath256 this is equivalent to state that @xmath257 has a minimum .",
    "static wormhole structures as those described by the above metric require that the average null energy condition must be violated in the wormhole throat . from the metric coefficients can be established ( e.g. morris and thorne 1988 , visser 1996 ) :    @xmath258    where @xmath259 and @xmath260 are the time and radial components of the einstein tensor : @xmath261 .    this constraint can be cast in terms of the stress - energy tensor of the matter threading the wormhole . using the field equations",
    ", it reads @xmath262 which represents a violation of the null energy condition .",
    "this implies also a violation of the weak energy condition ( see visser 1996 for details ) .",
    "plainly stated , it means that the matter threading the wormhole must exert gravitational repulsion in order to stay stable against collapse .",
    "although there are known violations to the energy conditions ( e.g. the casimir effect ) , it is far from clear at present whether large macroscopic amounts of `` exotic matter '' exist in nature . if natural wormholes exist in the universe ( e.g. if the original topology after the big - bang was multiply connected ) , then there should be observable electromagnetic signatures ( e.g. torres et al .",
    "currently , the observational data allow to establish an upper bound on the total amount of exotic matter under the form of wormholes of @xmath263 g @xmath264 .",
    "the production of this kind of matter in the laboratory is completely out of the current technical possibilities , at least in significant macroscopic quantities .",
    "finally , we mention that a wormhole can be immediately transformed into a time machine inducing a time - shift between the two mouths . this can be made through relativistic motion of the mouths ( a special relativity effect ) or by exposing one of them to an intense gravitational field ( see morris and thorne 1988 and morris et al .",
    "1988 for further details ; for the paradoxes of time travel , see romero and torres 2001 ) .",
    "according to eq . ( [ age ] ) , an isolated black hole with @xmath265 @xmath266 would have a lifetime of more than @xmath267 yr .",
    "this is 56 orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe .",
    "however , if the mass of the black hole is small , then it could evaporate within the hubble time .",
    "a primordial black hole , created by extremely energetic collisions short after the big bang , should have a mass of at least @xmath268 g in order to exist today .",
    "less massive black holes must have already evaporated .",
    "what happens when a black hole losses its mass so it can not sustain an event horizon anymore ? .",
    "as the black hole evaporates , its temperature raises .",
    "when it is cold , it radiates low energy photons .",
    "when the temperature increases , more and more energetic particles will be emitted . at some point gamma rays would be produced .",
    "if there is a population of primordial black holes , their radiation should contribute to the diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "this background seems to be dominated by the contribution of unresolved active galactic nuclei and current observations indicate that if there were primordial black holes their mass density should be less than @xmath269 , where @xmath212 is the cosmological density parameter ( @xmath270 ) . after producing gamma rays ,",
    "the mini black hole would produce leptons , quarks , and super - symmetric particles , if they exist . at the end",
    "the black hole would have a quantum size and the final remnant will depend on the details of how gravity behaves at planck scales . the final product might be a stable , microscopic object with a mass close to the planck mass .",
    "such particles might contribute to the dark matter present in the galaxy and in other galaxies and clusters .",
    "the cross - section of black hole relics is extremely small : @xmath271 @xmath272 ( frolov and novikov 1998 ) , hence they would be basically non - interacting particles .",
    "a different possibility , advocated by hawking ( 1976 ) , is that , as a result of the evaporation nothing is left behind : all the energy is radiated .",
    "this creates a puzzle about the fate of the information stored in the black hole : is it radiated away during the black hole lifetime or does it simply disappear from the universe ? .",
    "independently of the problem of mini black hole relics , it is clear that the fate of stellar - mass and supermassive black holes is related to fate of the whole universe . in an ever expanding universe or in an accelerating universe",
    "as it seems to be our actual universe , the fate of the black holes will depend on the acceleration rate .",
    "the local physics of the black hole is related to the cosmic expansion through the cosmological scale factor @xmath273 , which is an arbitrary ( positive ) function of the co - moving time @xmath72 .",
    "a schwarzschild black hole embedded in a friedmann - robertson - walker universe can be represented by a generalization of the mcvittie metric ( e.g. gao et al .",
    "2008 ) :    @xmath274^{2}}{\\left[1+\\frac{2 g m(t)}{a(t)c^{2}r}\\right]^{2 } } c^{2}dt^{2}-a(t)^{2}\\left[1+\\frac{2 g m(t)}{a(t)c^{2}r}\\right]^{4 } ( dr^{2 } + r^{2}d\\omega^{2 } ) .",
    "\\label{cosmicbh}\\ ] ]    assuming that @xmath275 , with @xmath276 a constant , the above metric can be used to study the evolution of the black hole as the universe expands .",
    "it is usual to adopt an equation of state for the cosmic fluid given by @xmath277 , with @xmath278 constant . for @xmath279",
    "the universe accelerates its expansion in such a way that the scale factor diverges in a finite time .",
    "this time is known as the big rip . if @xmath280 , then the big rip will occur in 35 gyr .",
    "the event horizon of the black hole and the cosmic apparent horizon will coincide for some time @xmath281 and then the singularity inside the black hole would be visible to observers in the universe .",
    "unfortunately for curious observers , schwarzschild black holes surely do not exist in nature , since all astrophysical bodies have some angular momentum and is reasonable then to expect only kerr black holes to exist in the universe .",
    "equation ( [ cosmicbh ] ) does not describe a cosmological embedded kerr black hole .",
    "although no detailed calculations exist for such a case , we can speculate that the observer would be allowed to have a look at the second horizon of the kerr black hole before being ripped apart along with the rest of the cosmos . a rather dark view for the doomsday .",
