    "the surprising discovery of the present late - time acceleration of the universe @xcite and the related fact that most of its energy is in the form of a mysterious dark energy is possibly one of the most puzzling issues of modern cosmology .",
    "several scenarios have been put forward as a possible explanation . a positive cosmological constant , although the simplest candidate , is not particularly attractive given the extreme fine tuning that is required to account for the observed accelerated expansion .",
    "this fact has led to models where the dark energy component varies with time , such as quintessence models . in these models",
    ", the required negative pressure is achieved trough the dynamics of a single ( light ) scalar field @xcite or , in some cases , two coupled scalar fields @xcite . despite some pleasing features , these models are not entirely satisfactory , since in order to achieve @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the dark energy and matter energy densities at present , respectively ) some fine tuning is required .",
    "many other possibilities have been considered for the origin of this dark energy component such as a scalar field with a non - standard kinetic term and k - essence models @xcite ; it is also possible to construct models which have @xmath3 , the so - called phantom energy models @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the evidence for a dark energy component might be explained by a change in the equation of state of the background fluid , with an exotic equation of state , the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model @xcite .",
    "the striking feature of this model is that it allows for an unification of dark energy and dark matter @xcite .    another possible explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe could be the infrared modification of gravity one should expect from , for instance , extra dimensional physics , which would lead to a modification of the effective friedmann equation at late times @xcite",
    ". an interesting variation of this proposal has been suggested by dvali and turner @xcite ( hereafter referred to as dt model ) .",
    "another possibility , also originally motivated by extra dimensions physics , is the modification of the friedmann equation by the introduction of an additional nonlinear term proportional to @xmath4 , the so - called cardassian model @xcite .",
    "currently type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) observations provide the most direct way to probe the dark energy component at low to medium redshifts .",
    "this is due to the fact that supernova data allows for a direct measurent of the luminosity distance , which is directly related to the expansion law of the universe which , in turn , is the physical quantity that is directly related with dark energy or that is modified by extra dimensional physics .",
    "this approach has been explored by various groups in order to obtain insight into the nature of dark energy . indeed , recently supernova data with 194 data points has been analysed @xcite and it was shown that it yields relevant constraints on some cosmological parameters .",
    "in particular , it is possible to conclude that , when one considers the full supernova data set , the decelerating model is ruled out with a significant confidence level .",
    "it is also shown that one can measure the current value of the dark energy equation of state with higher accuracy and the data prefers the phantom kind of equation of state , @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the most significant result of that analysis is that , without a flat prior , that supernova data does not favor a flat @xmath6cdm model at least up to @xmath7 confidence level , which is consistent with other cosmological observations . in what concerns the equation of state of the dark energy component",
    ", it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the same set of supernovae data , that the best fit equation of state of dark energy evolves rapidly from @xmath8 in the past to @xmath9 in the present , which suggests that a time varying dark energy is better fitted with the data than the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "this result is also robust to changes of @xmath2 and remains valid for the interval @xmath10 .",
    "supernova data has also been used in the context of different cosmological models for dark energy @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the cardassian , the dt and the gcg models in light of the riess _",
    "_ sne ia compilation of data @xcite .",
    "we consider both flat and non - flat priors .",
    "notice however , that our analysis is restricted to the very late history of the universe and does not address dark energy effects on the cosmic microwave background fluctuations or on structure formation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our best fit analysis of sne ia data that will be employed as methodology to constrain the dark energy models we have studied , namely the cardassian , dt and gcg models . in section",
    "iii we consider the best fit analysis to constrain the cardassiam dark energy model . in section iv , we discusss the dt model and in section v the dark energy - dark matter unification gcg model .",
    "section vi is devoted to the discussion of the degeneracy of the discussed models with the xcdm model through the introduction of the so - called jerk parameter . in section vii",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the observations of supernovae measure essentially the apparent magnitude @xmath11 , which is related to the luminosity distance @xmath12 by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dimensionless luminosity distance and @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the comoving distance given by @xmath17 also , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the absolute magnitude which is believed to be constant for all supernovae of type ia .    for our analysis",
    ", we consider the two sets of supernovae data recently compiled by riess _",
    "the first set contains 143 points from previously published data that were taken from the 230 tonry _",
    "@xcite data alongwith the 23 points from barris _ et al .",
    "they have discarded various points where the classification of the supernovae was not certain or the photometry was incomplete , increasing the reliability of the sample .",
    "the second set contains the 143 points from the first one plus 14 points discovered recently using hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite and is named as gold sample , following riess _",
    "et al._. we will name the first sample as gold w / o hst . the main difference between the two samples is that the full gold sample also covers higher redshifts ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the data points in these samples are given in terms of the distance modulus @xmath21 and the errors @xmath22 already quoted take into account the effects of peculiar motions .",
    "the @xmath23 is calculated from @xmath24 ^ 2~ ,   \\label{chisq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a free parameter and @xmath26 is the theoretical prediction for the dimensionless luminosity distance of a supernova at a particular distance , for a given model with parameters @xmath27 .",
    "it can be computed for each model from the friedmann expansion law ( cf .",
    "( [ friedcmodel2 ] ) , ( [ frieddtmodel ] ) or ( [ friedgcgmodel ] ) below ) combined with eqs .",
    "( [ dl]-[dm ] ) .    in the following",
    ", we will consider the three models referred to in the introduction and perform a best fit analysis with the minimization of the @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ chisq2 ] ) , with respect to @xmath28 , @xmath2 , @xmath29 and the respective model parameter(s ) , using a minuit @xcite based code .",
    "the allowed variation range of the parameters is presented in table [ table : range ] .",
    "@xmath28 is a model independent parameter and hence its best fit value should not depend on the specific model .",
    "we found that the best fit value for @xmath28 for all the models considered here is @xmath30 , which is consistent with the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "hence , we have also used this value for @xmath28 throughout our analysis .",
    "we have also checked that the result does not change if we marginalise over @xmath31 .",
    ".parameter range for the best - fit analysis [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to illustrate the degeneracy between our models and the xcdm model , with constant equation of state @xmath32 and dark energy density @xmath33 , let us consider the taylor expansion of the luminosity distance as @xmath34~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the deceleration parameter , related with the second derivative of the scale - factor , and @xmath36 is the so - callled statefinder or jerk parameter @xcite , related with the third derivative of the scale - factor .",
    "the subscript `` 0 '' means that quantities are evaluated at present .",
    "the jerk parameter is related with the deceleration parameter @xmath35 as @xmath37 notice that the jerk paramter is related to the geometry of the universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown that the measurement of the cubic correction to the hubble law via high - redshift supernovae is the first cosmological measurement , after the cmbr , that probes directly the effects of spatial curvature ) .",
    "we have calculated @xmath35 and @xmath38 for our models and obtained the results shown in table [ table : statefinders ] .",
    "we have considered only the flat case and , for simplicity , we study the dgp model instead of the more generic dt model ; @xmath39 is the only parameter of this model .    for low redshifts ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider the first two terms in the series expansion of the luminosity distance , eq .",
    "( [ dlseries ] ) . from the expression of @xmath35 for the gcg",
    ", we can see that in this case the sne ia can only constrain @xmath40 , as @xmath35 is independent of @xmath41 .",
    "however for the cardassian model the @xmath35 dependence is both on @xmath39 and @xmath42 , allowing low redshifts sne ia to put constraints in the model .",
    "moreover , in order to have degeneracy between the models we are analyzing and xcdm model , the @xmath35 parameter of these models must be equal , @xmath43 , which results that : @xmath44    if one goes to higher redshifts , one also has to consider the higher order terms in the expansion of @xmath45 ; hence , in this case also the jerk parameters have to be equal , which means that @xmath38 have to be the same .",
    "we get that for cardassian model @xmath46 meaning that the dynamical evolution of this model is equivalent to a dark energy model with the same matter density and a constant equation of state given by @xmath47 ; the equivalent dark energy potential can be written as @xmath48^{-\\sigma}$ ] with @xmath49 @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "we have seen that negative values of @xmath42 are preferred which is consistent with the fact that phantom equation of state , @xmath50 , is favored by the data @xcite",
    ".    for dgp model one finds @xmath51 we see that for @xmath52 the the equation of state is phantom - like and , as @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "we saw that the sne ia prefer @xmath55 , consistent with the fact that phantom equation of state is favored .",
    "moreover , the amount of matter needed in a xcdm model to be equivalent to a given dgp model is larger , @xmath56 .    for the gcg model",
    "we find @xmath57 we see that for any gcg model , the corresponding dark energy model equation of state has to be always phantom type @xcite , as @xmath58 and @xmath59 . nevertheless , for low redshift data , gcg is degenerate with all kinds of constant equation of state dark energy model , including @xmath6cdm model , as can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ gcgwx ] ) .    0.5 cm",
    "in this paper we have performed likelihood analysis of the latest type ia supernova data for three distinct dark matter models .",
    "we have considered the cardassian model , the modified gravity dvali - turner model and the generalized chaplygin gas model of unification of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "we find that sne ia most recent data allows , in all cases , for non - trivial constraints on model parameters as summarized in table ii .",
    "we find that for all models relaxing the flatness condition implies that data favors then a considerable negative curvature for the gold without hst dataset .",
    "for the gold dataset the resulting best fit value for the curvature is positive ( the gcg model is nearly flat in this case ) .",
    "for all models we have found , in what concerns the deceleration and jerk parameters , the conditions under which they are degenerate to the xcdm model .",
    "thus , sne ia data clearly favors phantom - like equivalent equations of state .    finally , in what concerns the gold sample of supernova data including those from hst measurements , our analysis reveals that that the gcg flat model is the better choice among the three possible alternative models that we have considered in this paper .",
