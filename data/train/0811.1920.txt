    "s localization errors @xcite . the crucial uncertainty , of course , is the nature ( luminosity , spectrum , and time  evolution ) of any em emission produced by coalescing smbhbs during the gw  inspiral stage .",
    "such emission would have to be related to gas in the vicinity , and possibly accreting onto the coalescing smbhs .",
    "the gas around the bhs would likely settle into a rotationally supported , circumbinary disk . in a geometrically thin disk , the torques from the binary create a central cavity , nearly devoid of gas , within a region about twice the orbital separation @xcite ( for a nearly equal  mass binary ) , or a narrower gap around the orbit of the lower  mass bh in the case of unequal masses @xmath2 and larger orbital separations @xcite . in the latter case , the lower",
    " mass hole could `` usher '' the gas inward as its orbit decays , producing a prompt and luminous signal during coalescence . in the former case , residual gas flow into the cavity and onto the bhs , such as suggested in numerical simulations @xcite ,",

    "can we identify coalescing smbhbs before the launch of _ lisa _ , as variable sources , due to periodic perturbations in the circumbinary gas (   [ sec : periodic ] ) ?",
    "the first and most fundamental question in searching for any em counterpart by looking for variable emission , during the final stages of coalescence , is the accuracy to which the _ lisa _ source can be localized at various look  back times _ prior to the coalescence_.

    "dependence of a coalescing smbh binary , and therefore knowing what to look for , would obviously greatly help in identifying the counterpart , possibly allowing an identification even post  merger .",

    "this suggests that the best strategy may be an `` open  minded '' search for any variable signatures prior and during coalescence .",

    "we investigated the response of a circumbinary disk to the kick @xcite .",
    "we adopted the following simplified picture for the disk around a fiducial , equal  mass , @xmath32 binary .",
    "the disk has an inner edge at @xmath33 ( schwarzschild radii ) , inside which it is empty ( with the gas evacuated due to torques from the binary ; e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and an outer edge at @xmath34 . outside of this radius",
    ", there may still be gas , but it may be unstable to fragmentation , and it will , in any case , evolve slowly ( the behavior of this gas will then not be relevant for a _",
    "lisa _ counterpart search , but if emission is produced in this gas , it could help identify smbhbs independently ; see discussion in the next section ) .",
    "the scale  height and temperature at the inner edge is @xmath35 and @xmath36k , respectively .",
    "the scale  height remains constant with radius out to @xmath37 , beyond which it increases nearly linearly ( @xmath38 ) .",

    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "the important features of such a disk ( as well as other proposed variants of thin @xmath40-disks ) are the following : ( i ) orbital motions in thin disks are supersonic , so that the gas is susceptible to shocks if disturbed ; ( ii ) at the relevant radii outside @xmath41 the viscous time ",
    "scale is long , and the orbits are near keplerian ; ( iii ) gas near the inner edge of disk is tightly bound to the kicked bhb ( @xmath42 ) , but the outer edge ( @xmath43 ) can be marginally bound , or even unbound , for large kicks ( a rough condition for being bound is @xmath44 ) , and ( iv ) the total disk mass within @xmath34 is much less than the bhb mass , which justifies ignoring the inertia of the gas bound to the bhb .    for a quantitative assessment of the disk s response to the kick , we employed the following approximation : the disk particles are assumed to be massless , collisionless , and initially on co - planar , circular orbits .",
    "the kick simply adds the velocity @xmath45 to the instantaneous orbital velocity of each particle ( in the inertial frame centered on the bhb ) .",
    "we used @xmath46 particles , distributed randomly and uniformly along the two  dimensional surface of the disk .",
    "the kick velocity was varied between @xmath47 , and directed either perpendicular or parallel to the initial disk plane .",
    "note that in both the perpendicular and parallel case , we start with a two  dimensional particle distribution ( i.e. an infinitely thin disk ) , but in the perpendicular case , we then follow the orbits in 3d .",
    "figure  [ fig : kicks ] shows , as an example , a face  on view of the surface density of the disk @xmath48 days after a kick with @xmath49 in the plane of the disk ( left panel ) .",
    "the sharp , tightly wound spiral features clearly seen in the figure trace the locus of points where particles cross each other , corresponding formally to a density caustic .",

    "the caustic must exceed the sound speed .",
    "at the outermost radius where the disk is marginally bound to the bhb , one expects @xmath62 ; relative motions will be slower further inside .",
    "the relative speed should roughly correspond to covering the epicyclic amplitude @xmath63 in the caustic  formation time @xmath64 , yielding @xmath65 . for @xmath66 ,",
    "this predicts @xmath67 ; we have verified in our simulations that particles cross the caustics at speeds within @xmath68 of this predicted value .",
    "compared with the sound speed @xmath69 , this suggests that the density waves produced by the kick in the gas beyond @xmath70 will indeed steepen into shocks .",
    "we also found that the inclination of the kick may be important in determining the strength and timing of such shocks .",
    "the nature of the emission resulting from the shocks or density enhancements will have to be addressed in future work , by incorporating the effects of hydrodynamics , computing the heating rate at the location of the spiral shocks , and modeling the overall disk structure and vertical radiation transport .",
    "however , in the fiducial case discussed above , if we assume that the shocked gas is heated to temperatures corresponding to @xmath61 , and @xmath71 is the time ",
    "scale on which the corresponding thermal energy is converted to photons , then we find that the luminosity may be a small but non  negligible fraction , 0.2 percent to 5 percent of the eddington luminosity of the central bh , and would increase with time roughly as @xmath72 .",
    "this suggests that the afterglows may be detectable , at least for nearby bhs and/or for the most massive bhs in lisa s range ( which extends up to @xmath73 ) .",
    "we may also speculate on the spectral evolution of the `` kick after ",
    "glow '' , based on the characteristic shock velocity at each radius .",
    "we find that the luminosity is dominated by the outermost shocked shells , with the spectrum peaking at the characteristic photon energy corresponding to @xmath74 .",
    "the shocks could therefore result in an afterglow , starting from @xmath75 days , first peaking in the uv band ( @xmath76ev or @xmath77 m , corresponding to @xmath78 ) , and then hardening to the euv / soft x  ray ( @xmath79ev ) range after @xmath80two years .",
    "the detection of such an afterglow would help identify em counterparts to _ lisa _ events .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the central cavity of the circumbinary disk is not completely empty , and that there can be non  negligible gas inflow into this cavity from the outside disk @xcite .",
    "the perturbations of the circumbinary gas by the rotating quadrupole potential of the binary , in fact , appears to impose large fluctuations on this inflow rate , tracking the orbital period @xcite .",
    "we must emphasize that the level and nature of em emission , associated with this inflow ( or with other effects from the gas in the vicinity of the binary during the late stages of binary evolution ) , remains essentially unknown .",
    "furthermore , even in the most optimistic scenario , in which a clearly periodic emission is indeed produced , at a significant and detectable flux level , there remains the ( potentially severe ) observational challenge of distinguishing such variability from other possible sources of periodic variations .    despite these uncertainties and caveats , however , it is interesting to ask the following question : if , indeed , non  negligible emission is produced during the late stages of binary evolution , and the luminosity varies periodically on the orbital time ",
    "scale , could such periodic sources possibly be identified in em surveys , even before _",
    "lisa _ becomes operational ?    as the orbit of each individual binary shrinks , its orbital period , and therefore , by assumption , its variability timescale decreases .",
    "the evolution of a binary embedded in a thin circumbinary disk generically proceeds through three distinct stages ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . _",
    "( i ) _ first , the binary is strongly coupled to the circumbinary disk and is driven by viscosity ( analogous to `` disk - dominated '' planetary migration ) , and the radius of the gap follows the binary . as the binary separation shrinks below @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) for mass ratios @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , the local disk density starts to dominate over the binary mass , and the binary evolves more slowly , according to",
    "so  called `` secondary  dominated '' type - ii migration . during this stage ,",
    "the gw emission is negligible . _",
    "( ii ) _ later , within the radius @xmath85 ,",
    "the binary starts to be driven primarily by gws but the radius of the gap can still follow the binary . _",
    "( iii ) _ finally , within @xmath86 the binary is entirely driven by gws and the binary falls in much more quickly than the outer edge of the gap is able to move inward .",
    "the ordering of these events is valid for a very broad range of binary and disk parameters .",
    "note that the outcome of the gas inside the binary s orbit is left unspecified above ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a possible outcome for @xmath87 ) .    in the last , gw  driven regime , the binary spends a characteristic time @xmath88 at each orbital separation @xmath89 that scales with the corresponding orbital time as @xmath90 .",

    "luminosity variations corresponding to a fraction @xmath115 of the eddington luminosity ( or , e.g. , a periodic component with amplitude @xmath116 $ ] magnitudes in the optical for bhbs at @xmath117 ) would have not been found in existing variability surveys .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ f : periodicsources ] , a dedicated , deep survey of a @xmath80deg@xmath4 area , possibly with existing instruments , could detect a population of @xmath80several to @xmath80several thousand such `` transition sources '' with a range of periods between 20 weeks @xmath118 60 weeks . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ f : periodicsources ] , we use the luminosity function of optical quasars , and assume that each optical quasar results from a smbh  smbh merger , and ,",

    "first , @xcite and @xcite followed the response of the gas disk around a recoiling smbhb , similar to our calculation described in   [ sec : kick ] , but on much longer timescales ( @xmath126 years ) .",
    "@xcite found that the shocked gas , thrown out of the disk plane by an oblique kick , may produce bright flares in x - ray lines ( assuming it remains optically thin ) .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , assumed that the disk gas is optically thick , and that the shocks are promptly dissipated in the disk plane , and derived a characteristic infrared light ",
    "the above effects arise from the change in the gravitational potential , following the recoil , i.e. from the `` shaking '' of the disk .",
    "a different possibility is that once the bhs have merged , the torques from the rotating quadrupolar potential cease to act on the gas outside the inner cavity , allowing the gas to accrete onto the merged binary on the viscous time - scale @xcite .",
    "an x  ray `` afterglow '' may then occur after a delay of @xmath80@xmath127 years",
