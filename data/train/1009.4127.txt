    "the application of elastic waves of suitable power and frequency ( in particular ultrasounds ) to a liquid with gas dispersed in it gives rise to the phenomenon known as acoustic cavitation  @xcite .",
    "the main physical effects occurring in a cavitated liquid can be accounted for in terms of a hydrodynamic model based on the formation and the collapse of imploding gas bubbles in the liquid  @xcite .",
    "the processes occurring during the collapse , and the collapse itself , are quite complex and a good deal of research has been carried out in order to clarify their physical and chemical aspects .",
    "in particular , theoretical and experimental studies on sonoluminescence ( i.e. the emission of light bursts from a cavitated liquid @xcite ) led to conclude that the temperature in the core of a collapsing bubble can reach @xmath0 @xmath1 and more @xcite .",
    "actually , even simple - minded calculations show that cavitation can produce an extreme concentration of energy for unit time in the collapsing gaseous bubble . to this regard ,",
    "let us consider a typical bubble , whose initial radius , as experimentally found , is of the order of 10@xmath2 m. if we suppose that nothing can stop the contraction down to a radius of atomic dimensions , namely 10@xmath3 m , then , by assuming that the total initial power stored within the bubble be constant , the surface power density at the end of contraction will be 10@xmath4 times greater than the initial one . for an initial power of 100 @xmath5 ,",
    "this means that within the final bubble we will have an equivalent temperature of 10@xmath6 @xmath1 ( corresponding to an energy for particle of 10 @xmath7 ) .",
    "so high temperatures could cause thermonuclear fusion ( _ sonofusion or acoustic inertial confinement fusion , aicf _ ) .",
    "the research on aicf ( pioneered by flynn in 1982  @xcite ) carried out in the last years @xcite-@xcite attempted to produce known nuclear reactions by means of pressure or ultrasounds and cavitation . to this aim ,",
    "the solutions involved contained deuterium and/or unstable nuclides .",
    "let us notice that this is by no means a completely new approach to standard nuclear reactions ( except for the use of cavitation ) .",
    "indeed , we recall that in the past some investigations  @xcite-@xcite have highlighted the ability of pressure and shock waves to generate autocatalytic fission - fusion reactions in compounds containing also uranium , tritium and deuterium .    on the other hand , experiments on the electric explosion of titanium foils in liquids @xcite-@xcite have evidenced changes in the concentrations of elements and alteration of the secular equilibrium of unstable nuclides . since one might argue that the shock waves caused by the foil explosion act on the matter in a way similar to ultrasounds in cavitation , all such experiments , together with those obtained by cavitating liquids , support the evidence for nuclear reactions induced by high mechanical pressures ( _ piezonuclear reactions , _ piezo from the ancient greek verb _",
    "piezin _ which means to press )",
    ".    moreover , since cavitation in liquids is basically a mean to generate pressure waves acting on the elements diluted in solutions , we hypothesized that _",
    "mechanical waves may give rise to piezonuclear effects also in solids subjected to pressure during crashing failure_. in other words , compenetration of molecular layers in solids would be the analogous of cavitation in liquids .",
    "this hypothesis was tested and proved indeed to be true @xcite .",
    "these considerations stress the need for ( and the importance of ) experiments looking at the physical features and implications of piezonuclear reactions , with special emphasis on the mass spectrum of the samples ( either liquid or solid ) before and after cavitation and on the possible emission of ionizing radiation and neutrons .    to this aim ,",
    "in the last years , we carried out a series of experiments on piezonuclear reactions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they can be roughly divided in three groups : 1 ) experiments on cavitating water @xcite-@xcite ; 2 ) experiments on cavitating salt solutions @xcite-@xcite ; 3 ) experiments on fracture of solids @xcite . in the first group",
    ", we looked for transformations of elements , whereas the other two sets of experiments were devoted to the detection of emitted neutrons .",
    "two points need to be stressed .",
    "first , our research , although it might seem to deal with the same physical terms such as nuclear reactions , nuclear radiation and to point towards the same technological direction , is based on a different theoretical framework @xcite-@xcite , according to which nuclear processes ( not necessarily of the standard type ) can be induced in stable nuclides too only by suitable mechanical waves , i.e. without any application of radioactive or nuclear active substances .",
    "then , it never involved any radioactive source or unstable nuclide ( except for the case of @xcite ) , unlike other experiments  @xcite - kriv,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "our work concentrated on absolutely stable elements , and in this sense it is moving along a parallel path with respect to the other research streams .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we discuss all the experiments carried out by cavitating water .",
    "the results obtained by cavitation of liquid solutions of metal salts are described in sect.3 , where the fundamental role of iron salts in order to get neutron emission is stressed .",
    "sect.4 deals with the problem of the effect of cavitation on a solution containing thorium , which apparently shows its reduction at a rate 10@xmath8 times faster than its natural decay . in sect.5",
    "we discuss the evidence for piezonuclear reactions in brittle fracture of solids , in which neutron emissions is observed too .",
    "sect.6 is devoted  to a brief comparison with other experiments of similar kind ( although a deep discussion with lenr phenomenology deserves a paper by its own ) . in sect.7",
    "we propose a possible theoretical explanation of piezonuclear reactions , partly classical and partly based on the formalism of a deformed minkowski space - time ( in which the metric coefficients are functions of energy ) .",
    "the last section contains some possible developments and perspectives .",
    "in our first three experiments on cavitation @xcite-@xcite , we restricted ourselves to detect the mass spectrum changes , after cavitation , together with possible presence of ionizing radiation . as regards the substance undergoing cavitation , two main considerations led us to choose the deionized and distilled water . in first place , we know from both theoretical and experimental studies that its phenomenological behaviour during cavitation satisfies the rayleigh - plesset equation .",
    "in this respect , we remark that , although at the present time we do nt have a simple theory of phenomena ( such as sonoluminescence ) , connected to the cavitation process , and the use of this equation was not accepted by all researchers @xcite , the latter is , however , the starting point for a determination of the macroscopic phenomenological parameters needed to implement the cavitation itself .      in the first experimental work ( carried out at perugia university in 1998 )",
    "@xcite , we utilized a new type of * *  * * sonotrode * *  * * ( cavitator ) with a very long working time ( @xmath9 30 @xmath10 ) .",
    "its main feature consisted in the cooling system , that allows one to keep constant the resonance frequency for a time interval much longer that possible with the presently available sonotrodes .",
    "this cavitator was composed by a titanium tip shaped with an exponential profile , connected to a column of piezoelectrics cooled by oil in a pressure circuit with dry ice choke .",
    "through such a device we subjected to cavitation a sample of bidistilled and deionised water at room temperature .",
    "the vessel of the cavitator was made of optical flint glass . during the cavitation process",
    ", the titanium tip of the cavitator was directly immersed and the water surface was free .",
    "the water sample was subjected to ultrasounds without stopping for a total time of 210 @xmath10 at the constant power of 630 @xmath5 and at the frequency of 20 @xmath11 , in order to induce cavitation according to the rayleigh - plesset equation  bren .",
    "we performed a gamma spectrometry on samples of cavitated and uncavitated water without finding any radioactivity increase in cavitated water .",
    "after cavitation , we analyzed the cavitated water sample , confining our analysis to the stable chemical elements ( from z = 1 to z = 92 ) , and we compared the new results with those obtained from the uncavitated water .",
    "the analysis of the water both before and after cavitation was carried out by three different procedures , reaching the precision of 1 @xmath12 and with a standard deviation on concentration given by @xmath13= 10@xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "the three procedures consisted in :    - mass atomic absorption ( icp ) ;    - cyclotron spectrometry ( icr ) ;    - mass spectrometry ( ms ) .",
    "all these measurements have been carried out using different apparatuses and by different personnel staff .",
    "therefore , the concentration of each element was measured at least three times .",
    "more precisely : the icp and the icr measurements were carried out for all elements ; as a check , the icp measurement was repeated for the elements with decreasing and increasing concentrations ; the ms measurements were carried out only for the elements from h to pd .",
    "we carried out also a measurement of device background , without water , for each vacuum chamber used .",
    "very surprisingly , we found relevant changes in the concentrations of the elements ( in units of @xmath15 ) in the cavitated sample ( despite the very low original concentration ) . in order to asset the changes in the chemical elements ,",
    "the variation factors have been accepted only for a value @xmath162 in the concentration ratios in water after and before cavitation .",
    "evidence was found for 10 increasing and 19 decreasing elements .",
    "let us notice , in particular , that the decrease concerned stable elements with low mass number .",
    "we checked the possible contributions to changes due to impurities , possibly arising from the titanium tip of the cavitator and the flint glass of the vessel , by three different methods :    - mass atomic absorption ( icp ) on cavitated water sample ;    - electron microscopy on dusts of tip and vessel ;    - x - ray microanalysis , carried out by two different laboratories on both the dusts of tip and vessel and the dry residues of the two ( cavitated and uncavitated ) water samples .",
    "the obtained results let us exclude contributions due to impurities to the observed concentration changes @xcite .    during cavitation",
    ", we looked for the possible emission of radiation by putting , on the external walls of the vessel , slabs of colloid lr115 , sensitive to ionisation energies in the range 100 @xmath17- 4 @xmath7 , which are typical e.g. of @xmath18-particles .",
    "we measured , by means of the same kind of slabs , the background radiation in the laboratory room where water cavitation was being carried out , and we found a flux intensity of ( 210 - 150 ) @xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "we analyzed the slabs and observed no significant differences between the two sets of slabs , those put on the vessel walls and those which recorded the background radiation .",
    "subsequently , five months later , we carried out again a @xmath21-spectrometry on samples of both uncavitated and cavitated water without finding any appreciable difference , thus confirming the previous evidence .",
    "a basic point to be stressed is that , even if the cavitation gave rise to an increase of the concentration of some elements and to a decrease of others , _ the number of protons was actually conserved .",
    "_ this is easily seen if we take into consideration the difference @xmath22 , defined as@xmath23where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the average concentration ratio after cavitation of the i - th ( d - th ) increasing ( decreasing ) element , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) the corresponding atomic number . from our data we found:@xmath28which is actually negligible , being about 10@xmath29 of the number of protons involved ( on account of the variation factors ) , say @xmath30 , @xmath31 for each element undergoing a concentration change . on the contrary , _ the number of neutrons between increasing and decreasing elements was not conserved .",
    "_    moreover , a huge increase in the concentration of uranium was found , of about two orders of magnitude .",
    "this result led us to perform the second experiment .",
    "the measurements of the first experiment were confined to the stable chemical elements .",
    "we  therefore performed a second cavitation experiment and analyzed the mass composition of cavitated water by a spectrometer in the mass region 210@xmath33m@xmath33271 @xcite .",
    "we subjected to cavitation by a standard sonotrode a mass of bidistilled and deionised water of about 30 @xmath34 , contained in a pyrex vessel at room temperature .",
    "the cavitation was carried out in an underground laboratory at the tuscia university of viterbo .",
    "four mass measurements were carried out on samples from water cavitated one , two , three and four times .",
    "therefore , the whole cavitation time ranged from 10 @xmath10 for the first water sample to 40 @xmath10 for the last water sample .",
    "each measurement was performed immediately after each cavitation run .",
    "we confined ourselves to merely counting the different masses identified by the spectrometer .",
    "an error @xmath35 was accepted in the mass value determination .",

    "the numbers @xmath45 are defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of nuclei measured in the @xmath42-th mass interval in the @xmath41-th water sample cavitated @xmath41 times , and @xmath48 is the number of nuclei measured in the @xmath42-th mass interval in the background / blank measurement ( which of course includes the masses of the calibration compound ) .    in fig.[unst ] the numbers of nuclides @xmath49 ( @xmath44 )",
    "are plotted as functions of the cavitation runs @xmath41 .",
    "on the left it is seen that the excess in the number of masses identified in run 3 , in the water sample cavitated 3 times , has to be ascribed to masses in region 2 , 238@xmath33m@xmath33271 .",
    "in such a region 2 , the contribution to the excess in the number of masses appears to be due to masses in the transuranic region , 238@xmath33m@xmath33264 , as shown on the right in fig.unst .",
    "one might argue that the excess in the number of masses could be due to the formation of macromolecules by processes like _",
    "e.g. _ dimerization .",
    "however , such a possibility is unable to explain why the excess is just concentrated in a definite mass interval , _",
    "i.e. _ in the transuranic region . on the other hand , possible contributions from cosmic - rays induced phenomena ( like spallation ) even at altitudes less than 200 @xmath50 a.s.l. as it is indeed the case of the experiment sites  could give rise to an excess of light nuclei , but can not explain an increment of heavy nuclei ( even less the presence of nuclei heavier than uranium ) .",
    "moreover , the actual presence of transuranic elements is supported by the huge increase of uranium found in the first experiment , which might just be explained in terms of the formation and subsequent decay of transuranic elements .",
    "the results of the first experiment do agree with the results of the second one , showing the rearrangement of elements , with the decrease in the concentrations of light - medium elements , and the increase in those of the heavy ones .",
    "although a definite conclusion can only be drawn by carrying out a further experiment in the whole mass range , including both stable and transuranic elements , it is reasonable to assume that the excess of masses in the transuranic region are compensated by a simultaneous deficit of masses in the stable element region .",
    "such a picture is supported by the different behavior of the @xmath49 s ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the net increase of @xmath52 is due to the fact that in the mass range 210@xmath33m@xmath33238  there are mainly stable nuclei , and therefore their number increases following the production . on the contrary , in the range @xmath53 and 238@xmath33m@xmath33270 , there are only unstable radionuclides ( either experimentally known or theoretically predicted ) .",
    "thus , their number first increases , then decreases ( after the third cavitation ) as soon as the decay rate overcomes the rate of production .",
    "we have seen that the first two experiments provided evidence for a change in concentrations of stable and transuranic chemical elements in cavitated water @xcite .",
    "the third experiment was aimed at looking for the production of the so - called rare earth elements , and was performed at the university of rome la sapienza  @xcite . to cavitate water , the same sonotrode device of the second experiment",
    "was employed , but with a reduced power setup ( still able to induce cavitation ) , in order to account for the different contributions to the phenomenon due to both the cavitation and the ultrasounds at different powers .",
    "the sonotrode tip , shaped like a truncated cone , was plunged into an open vessel at atmospheric pressure , filled with water at room temperature .",
    "the water surface was free .",
    "the sonotrode was cooled by air at room temperature ( 20@xmath54 ) and had a working frequency @xmath55 = 20 @xmath11 , and transmitted power @xmath56 = 100 @xmath5 .",
    "the continuous operation folding time of this sonotrode was 15 @xmath57 , followed by a cooling period ( 15 @xmath10 ) of the column of piezoelectrics . during the cooling period",
    "the sonotrode was off .",
    "it was chosen to examine , through icp , two mass intervals , from 90 to 150 @xmath58 and from 200 to 255 @xmath59 , since they include also the rare earth elements we were looking for .",
    "for every mass value in the two intervals , subdivided into steps of 0.01@xmath59 , the results of the icp mass count were analyzed .",
    "the count series coincided with the measure series ; the latter were obtained using the count data acquisition program pq vision supplied by thermo elemental .",
    "the aim of this analysis was to highlight the count variations ( decrease or increase compared with the previous count ) .    for each mass the upper limit for the count background was evaluated , including both blank and noise .",
    "one took into consideration the masses whose upper count was higher than this upper limit .",
    "a given mass was taken into account only if its count was at least twice greater than the upper limit .",
    "this criterion was applied to the counts obtained , for the same mass values , from measures performed with scanning times of both 10 @xmath60 and 150 @xmath60 .",
    "no mass whose counts satisfied the described criterion was identified for scanning times of 150 @xmath60 , whereas only one mass was found for the scanning time of 10 @xmath60 , namely @xmath61 = ( 137.93 @xmath62 0.01 ) @xmath59 .",
    "we performed differential measurements with a time interval of 300 @xmath60 , corresponding to the cavitation interval time .",
    "then one got the differential counts , from which we derived the integral counts plotted in fig .",
    "[ eur ] as function of the cavitation interval time . in this way",
    "the data have been ensured from instrumental pile - up effects .     _",
    "in the third experiment of cavitating water_.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the identification of the observed peak with a given radionuclide required the determination of the lifetime .",
    "this could be done by analyzing fig.eur , and interpreting it as two subsequent cycles of production and decay of the observed element@xcite .",
    "thus it was possible to evaluate  its halftime @xmath63(12@xmath641 ) @xmath60 within 1.5 @xmath13 .    from the tables of nuclides",
    "@xcite we got as possible candidate the isotope of europium @xmath65 @xcite .    during the first experiment",
    "the concentration of @xmath66 was not changed .",
    "it is known that the abundance on earth of stable europium is less than 1.06 @xmath67 ( the natural @xmath68 is a mixture of two isotopes , @xmath69 with a percentage abundance of 47.77% and @xmath70 with a percentage abundance of 52.23% ) . the candidate identified during the third experiment does not exist in nature ; it is an artificial radionuclide ( discovered only in 1995 - 97 @xcite ) that can be produced at the present time in nuclear reactors and by synchrotrons .",
    "there are two ways whereby @xmath65 can be produced : by nuclear fission or by nuclear fusion .",
    "the former process requires less energy .",
    "however , from the results of the first two experiments @xcite , the quantity of heavy nuclei which can produce @xmath71 by nuclear fission is very much smaller ( by two - three orders of magnitude ) than that of the intermediate nuclei which can produce it by fusion ( on account also of the impurities of the tip ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a rough estimate ( just based on the detected abundance of heavy nuclei in the second experiment ) yields a probability of 10@xmath72 - 10@xmath73 for the production of @xmath71 by fission .",
    "moreover , nuclear fusion is the only possible explanation of the changes in concentration of stable elements , induced by cavitation , observed in the first experiment .",
    "we recall that , in our first experiment ( see sect.2 ) , proton number was practically conserved , whereas neutron number was apparently not .",
    "this constitutes an indirect hint of some sort of neutron production in such cavitation processes .",
    "since , as is well known , nuclear reactions in most cases involve neutron emission , it is a fundamental issue to check whether neutrons are produced indeed in processes possibly involving piezonuclear reactions .",
    "we point out that e.g. the experiments of refs.@xcite - tal3 have shown that cavitation of deuterated acetone can produce neutrons . in order to shed some light on this issue of neutron emission during cavitation , in 2004 - 2007 we carried out some experiments in which we cavitated controlled solutions of salts in water at cnr national laboratories ( rome 1 area ) and italian armed forces technical facilities ( also with the support of enea , ansaldo nucleare and arpa - lazio ) .",
    "we focused our attention on ionizing radiation and neutron emission .",
    "the details of these experiments are reported in the following .",
    "the employed ultrasonic equipment was the robust ultrasound welder dn20/2000md by sonotronic  @xcite .",
    "we slightly modified the piezoelectrics and the sonotrode configuration in order to provide the equipment with a compressed air cooling system which allowed it to work for 90 minutes without stopping , at a frequency of 20 @xmath11 .",
    "as cavitation chamber , we used a schott duran  vessel made of borosilicate glass of 250 @xmath74 and 500 @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "the truncated conical sonotrode that conveyed ultrasounds was made of aisi grade 304 steel .",
    "in all the experiments , the cavitated solutions were made using deionized and bidistilled water ( 18.2 @xmath75 ) .",
    "a magnetometer was used in order to take under control the local magnetic field ( always found compatible with the local magnetic field of earth , measured in absence of cavitation ) and along with it possible currents generated by the converting piezoelectric units that might have affected the electronics of the geiger counters and of the gamma spectrometer .",
    "let s now focus our attention on the technique used to reveal the possible neutron emission that we may expect during cavitation from the results of our previous experiments ( see sect.2 ) .",
    "the only hint that we got from them is the non - conservation of the number of neutrons ( according to the mass spectrometer analyses ) , which suggests a possible neutron emission , but does not say anything about their spectrum , their isotropy and homogeneity in space and their constancy in time .",
    "this wide range of possibilities convinced us that the first step to be moved in order to ascertain this hint was just to reveal the presence of neutrons in a sort of a yes or no detecting procedure , by leaving a complete and more exhausting proper measurement to a second higher and more accurate level of investigation , grounded on the possible positive answer from this first level of inquiry .",
    "thus , we decided at first to use neutron passive detectors which are capable of integrating neutron radiation within their energy range , regardless of the time feature of their emission .",
    "such devices do not require any sort of adaptive electronic calibration which would be necessary with an electronic detector in order to track and follow an emission that , as far as we know , could be the most variable one in terms of energy and time . the passive detectors that we utilized were the so - called defenders and the cr-39 plates .",
    "once that an initial but solid evidence of neutron emission was gathered by these passive detectors , we increased the quality of our investigation by moving to electronic boron trifluoride detectors . before presenting the experiments and their results , it is important to stress at this stage some features of the detectors and state what was done in order to keep them under control .",
    "the defenders were produced by bti ( bubble technology industries ) and consisted of minute droplets of a superheated liquid dispersed throughout an elastic polymer gel .",
    "when neutrons strike these droplets , they form small gas bubbles that remain fixed in the polymer . the number of bubbles is directly related to the amount and the energy of neutrons , so the obtained bubble pattern provides an immediate visual record of the neutron dose ( see fig.[neutr - ion ] ) .",
    "each defender was provided with its own calibration number ( @xmath76 @xmath77 ) , so it was possible to convert the number of bubbles into dose equivalent .",
    "we shall present two sets of experiments during which two different kinds of bubble detectors were used : defender and defender xl .",
    "their specifications are slightly different .",
    "the defender are cylinders 19.4 @xmath78 long ( their active part is 10 @xmath78 long ) and with a diameter of 2.1 @xmath78 .",
    "their minimum detection level is a tenth of an ounce of plutonium in seconds at 1 meter .",
    "it was determined to be about 100 counts/@xmath79 to @xmath80cf at 20 @xmath54 . the defender xl  are cylinders 47 @xmath78 long ( their active part is 30 @xmath81 long ) with a diameter of 5.7 @xmath78 .",
    "they have a sensitivity higher ( by one order of magnitude ) than that of the defenders , their minimum detection level being a hundredth of an ounce of plutonium in seconds at 1 meter .",
    "their response was determined to be about 1000 counts/@xmath79 to @xmath80cf at 20 @xmath82c .",
    "both types of defenders are sensitive to neutrons in the energy range between 10 @xmath83 and 15 @xmath7 , and their response is dose rate - independent and spatially isotropic .",
    "moreover , both defender and defender xl are completely unaffected by gamma radiation , as stated by the manufacturer and it was experimentally checked by irradiating them with a known source of @xmath84co for several minutes without producing the tiniest bubble . due to their very operation way , both kinds of defender detectors are sensitive to ionizing radiation too . however , the morphology and the distribution of the bubbles are quite different , as shown by fig.[neutr - ion ] ( supplied by the manufacturer , bti ) . in the picture on the left one sees the effect produced by neutrons in two defenders .",
    "the bubbles are big and spread out the whole volume .",
    "conversely , the two detectors on the right show a different type and a different distribution of bubbles ( generated by heavy ions ) , gathered in a cluster and much smaller than those produced by neutrons .",
    "the cr-39 ( padc ) plastic track detector is a c@xmath85h@xmath86o@xmath87 polymer with density 1.3 @xmath88 which is used for registration of heavy charged particles and is a very convenient mean of detection .",
    "charged particles are registered directly , and neutrons are detected through a secondary recoil particles or nuclear reactions .",
    "the cr39 energy range sensitivity is very wide , from tens of @xmath83 to hundreds of @xmath7 .",
    "particle tracks on the detector become visible after chemical etching and are investigated using a microscope . in order to detect neutrons by the cr39 , we used the nuclear reaction @xmath89(@xmath90,@xmath18)@xmath91 and hence spread a 2 @xmath92 layer of natural boron ( 80.1% @xmath93 , 19.9% @xmath89 ) on the cr39 detecting surface which had to convert neutrons into alpha particles , following a well known technology  @xcite .",
    "measurements of ionizing ( @xmath18 , @xmath94 and @xmath21 ) radiation background were carried out by using three types of detectors : geiger counter gamma scout  @xcite with a mica window transparent to @xmath18 , @xmath94 and @xmath21 radiation , and provided with two aluminium filters 1 @xmath92 and 3 @xmath92 thick , to screen @xmath18 radiation and @xmath18 and @xmath95 , respectively ; polycarbonate plate detectors pdac cr39 sensitive to ionizing radiation in the energy range 40 @xmath83 -4 @xmath7 and tallium ( tl ) activated , sodium iodine ( nai ) , @xmath21-ray spectrometer gamma 8000  amptek .",
    "two separate investigations have been carried out . in the first one , we subjected to cavitation not only bidistilled deionized water , but also solutions of four different salts in h@xmath96o ( with concentration of 1 @xmath67 ) , namely :    * 250 @xmath74 of h@xmath96o ; * 250 @xmath74 of h@xmath96o solution of iron chloride fecl@xmath97 ; * 250 @xmath74 of h@xmath96o solution of aluminium chloride alcl@xmath97 ; * 250 @xmath74 of h@xmath96o solution of lithium chloride licl ; * 500 @xmath74 of h@xmath96o solution of iron nitrate fe(no@xmath97)@xmath97 .",
    "each of the first four cavitations lasted 90 @xmath10 , while the iron nitrate solution was cavitated for 120 @xmath10 .",
    "the schematic layout of the experimental equipment is shown in fig.[layout ] .",
    "the cavitation chamber ( vessel ) was in the centre and the sonotrode has to be imagined perpendicular to the plane of the figure , just over the vessel and lined up with it .",
    "the immersion of the sonotrode and the distance of its tip from the bottom of the vessel were about 4 @xmath78 and 5 @xmath78 respectively .",
    "they were suitably studied with reference to the cavitation chamber , in order to maximize the concentration of energy utilized for cavitation ( by taking advantage also of the pressure waves reflected by the bottom of the cavitation chamber toward the sonotrode tip , and reducing the energy dispersion in the piezoconvective motions of the cavitated liquid ) .    for each cavitation experiment",
    ", we used three neutron detectors defender .",
    "they were placed vertically and parallel to the vessel or the sonotrode axis , arranged as shown in fig.[layout ] .",
    "one of the defenders was screened by immersing it in a cylinder of carbon ( moderator ) 3 @xmath78 thick .",
    "the geiger counter was pointed towards the area inside the vessel where cavitation took place .",
    "a second equal arrangement of three defenders and the vessel containing the same uncavitated solution ( blank ) , was placed in a different room and was used to measure the neutron radiation background at the same time when cavitation was taking place .",
    "the measurements of fast neutron radiation carried out in the experiments with h@xmath96o , aluminium chloride and lithium chloride were compatible with the background level ( 20 @xmath98 ) . on the contrary , in the second and the fifth experiment , with iron chloride and iron nitrate respectively , the measured neutron radiation was _ incompatible _ with the neutron background level .",
    "let us remark that the appearance of bubbles in these detectors can be brought about by other sources than neutrons .",
    "since the droplets are in a metastable state , they can be turned into bubbles as they receive the correct amount of energy , which can be conveyed to them by heat and mechanical compressions , just like ultrasounds . as to heat ,",
    "the defender detectors are temperature - compensated and their correct operation is guaranteed in the range from 15 @xmath54 to 35 @xmath54 . besides , the temperature of the laboratory ( a small room ) was kept constant at about @xmath99 @xmath54 by a heat pump that could work in reverse mode as well .",
    "of course we monitored by an infrared thermometer the temperature of the defenders all over their body and with particular care on the area nearer to the vessel that became warm during cavitation .",
    "the temperature of this specific part never exceeded 26 @xmath54 , which is well within the working temperature guaranteed by the manufacturer . by comparing the number of bubbles popped up during each experiment",
    ", one can unmistakably state that they can not be brought about by heat , since the temperature increases of the solutions treated by ultrasounds in all the experiments were always compatible with each other within @xmath645 @xmath54 , while the number of bubbles ranged from less than 10 up to 70 . as to the second possible source of bubbles , i.e. ultrasounds , the ultrasound power and the experimental setup were the same for all the five experiments , but only in two out of five we got a neutron signal higher than the background .",
    "this evidence rules out ultrasounds as the possible cause of bubbles in the defenders .",
    "a more quantitative behavior of the phenomenon is illustrated by fig.chloride graph 1 and fig.[nitrate graph ] , which report the neutron doses in nano - sievert as function of the cavitation time .",
    "the horizontal black line represents the sum of the measured thermodynamical instability of the detectors and of the measured neutron background level and is equal to 20 @xmath100 . in both graphs ,",
    "the values correspond to the mean of the two equivalent doses obtained by the two defenders without moderator used during cavitation .",
    "the error bars were determined by taking the root mean square of the differences of the two equivalent doses and the mean value .    _ ) vs. the cavitation time for _ @xmath101 _ _ solution .",

    "the negative outcomes of the three experiments with water , aluminium chloride and lithium chloride allow one to conclude that the neutrons emitted during the cavitation of iron chloride can not be related to the presence of @xmath103 and @xmath104 in this experiment .",
    "as to the positive outcomes of the fifth experiment with iron nitrate , although it can not be excluded that the neutron emission be related to the presence of nitrogen , we can certainly state that this emission took place when iron was part of the cavitated solution .    moreover , the absence of ionizing radiation @xmath18 , @xmath94 and @xmath21 above the background level in all the experiments  even in those two in which we got the evidence of neutron emission",
    " means that neutrons were produced without the usual consequent emission of gamma radiation .",
    "one can therefore state that _ only the presence of iron in the cavitated solution gave rise to neutron emission ( and therefore to nuclear processes induced by cavitation ) _ , but without the accompanying emission of @xmath105 radiation .",
    "of course , this could mean either that gamma radiation was not emitted at all as it usually is when neutrons are emitted , or that the sensitivity of our detectors was not sufficient to reveal their slight presence .",
    "besides , we have to point out that even if neutron emission took place without any consequent gamma radiation from nuclei de - excitation , one would expect gamma rays to be emitted from neutron capture by the proton of hydrogen anyway.this is an issue which will certainly be addressed in future experiments .    moreover , the increase of the derivative that appears quite evidently in the last 30 minutes of cavitation for fecl@xmath97 ( fig.[chloride graph 1 ] ) and fe(no@xmath97)@xmath97 ( fig.[nitrate graph ] ) . may be read as a first corroborating evidence for the phenomenological model proposed by two of us ( f.c . and r.m .",
    ")  @xcite , which assumes the existence of a threshold in power and energy ( and hence time ) for piezonuclear reactions to happen . in this sense , provided the ultrasonic power transmitted into the solution is higher than the required threshold  @xcite , the emission of neutrons produced by these reactions begins only after that a certain amount of energy was conveyed into the solution or , equivalently , after a certain time interval .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in sect.7 .",
    "further , if the bubble collapse is the main microscopical mechanism to induce piezonuclear reactions ( and hence neutron radiation ) @xcite , then it is expected on physical grounds that the emission of neutrons does not take place as from a stable source but , conversely , it happens in bursts ( as it occurs for sonoluminescence @xcite ) .",
    "however , this consideration can be considered at this stage only as a heuristic hypothesis .",
    "we shall come back to this point in the following .      since the first investigation highlighted the basic role of iron in producing piezonuclear reactions , the second one was devoted to a systematic study of such an evidence , by using solutions with only iron nitrate , since it gave rise , in the previous investigation , to the maximum flux of emitted neutrons .",
    "then , six cavitation runs ( each lasting 90 @xmath10 ) were carried out on the same quantity ( 250 @xmath74 ) of pure water and of a solution of fe(no@xmath106)@xmath97 with different concentration , subjected to ultrasounds of different power .",
    "namely , the cavitated solutions could have three possible concentrations , 0 @xmath67 ( h@xmath96o ) , 1 @xmath67 and 10 @xmath67 . moreover , the oscillation amplitude and hence the transmitted ultrasonic power took two different values , 50% and 70% , corresponding to about 100 @xmath5 and 130 @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the energy delivered to the solution within the whole cavitation time was 0.54 @xmath107 and 0.70 @xmath107 in the two cases . in order to measure neutron radiation we employed five neutron detectors of the defender xl type .",
    "background neutron measurements were accomplished at the beginning of the whole set of cavitations . during each cavitation we carried out ionizing radiation measurements by two",
    "geiger counters gamma scout  scout , one with no aluminum filter and the other with a 3 @xmath92 filter , used simultaneously . a picture and the layout of the experimental apparatus used in the six cavitation runs are shown in fig.[2 layout ] .        the two vertical cylinders ( a and b ) contained one defender xl each , of the same type of the three horizontal ones .",
    "the detectors were surrounded , and hence screened , by 3 @xmath78 of boron powder ( b ) ( thermal neutron absorber ) and by 3 @xmath78 of carbon powder ( a ) ( neutron moderator ) , respectively . in all of the six experiments of this second investigation ,",
    "the three horizontal , unscreened defender xl s measured a neutron emission significantly higher than the background level . the two vertical , screened defender xl s ( both by boron and carbon ) always detected a reduced neutron dose , comparable with the background one ( thus again providing further evidence of the neutron origin of the bubble signals ) .",
    "for all the six experiments , we plotted the measured doses of neutrons ( in nano - sievert ) as function of the cavitation time .",
    "the number of bubbles was counted every 10 @xmath10 .",
    "each curve corresponds to one concentration of the fe(no@xmath97)@xmath97 solution , from 0 @xmath67 to 10 @xmath67 , and one oscillation amplitude ( and therefore ultrasonic power ) , 50% ( 100 @xmath5 ) or 70% ( 130 @xmath5 ) .",
    "the six graphs are reported in fig.[graphs1 ] .    _",
    "_ ) as a function of time in minutes ( time interval 10 _ _ @xmath108 _ _ ) .",
    "each curve corresponds to one value of concentration and one of the amplitude .",
    "the horizontal line in all graphs corresponds to the thermodynamical background of 3.5 _ _ @xmath100 . _ _  the graphs are displaced in a cartesian plane , with concentration ( in ppm ) on the y - axis and amplitude ( power ) on the x - axis.__,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    they are displaced in a cartesian coordinate system with concentration on the y - axis and amplitude ( power ) on the x - axis . as in the first investigation , the horizontal black line represents the sum of the measured thermodynamical instability of the detectors and of the measured neutron background level .",
    "the six graphs of fig.[graphs1 ] do not show the threshold behaviour in energy that we found in the first investigation , namely the sharp and sudden increase of the curve derivative in the last 30 minutes of cavitation . despite that , according to our heuristic hypothesis ( which will be experimentally supported in the following ) about the neutron emission taking place in bursts , it will be wrong to interpret these curves as a sign of a stable neutron emission .",
    "conversely , still considering valid this hypothesis , one can ascribe this different behaviour between the first and the second investigations to the different immersions of the sonotrode in the solution , which was about 4 @xmath78 ( about 5 @xmath78 from the bottom of the vessel ) in the former and only 1 @xmath78 ( about 10 @xmath78 from the bottom of the vessel ) in the latter .",
    "this means that both the height of the neutron peaks ( bursts ) and , hence , the emitted dose can be controlled somehow by this geometrical parameter .",
    "this consideration allows one to ascribe this apparent lack of threshold behaviour to the reduced height of the neutron peaks emitted during the cavitations performed in the second investigation with respect to those emitted in the first one .",
    "this reduced height spreads the neutron dose over a longer period of time , thus preventing the threshold behaviour from showing up .",
    "it will be the purpose of our future investigations to establish the time of appearance of the first neutron burst and verify whether it takes place beyond the energy ( or time ) threshold .",
    "moreover , fig.[graphs1 ] further disproves the possible criticism about a possible generation of the bubbles by ultrasounds rather than by neutrons .",
    "indeed , by looking at the compound graph and reading it along its columns , i.e. keeping the amplitude ( power ) fixed , it is seen that the curves are different , while the ultrasonic power is always the same .",
    "conversely , had ultrasounds been the real cause of the bubbles , one should have had equal effects .",
    "a possible origin of the bubbles due to heath must be discarded on the basis of the precautions we took as in the previous investigation ( stabilization of the laboratory temperature and check of the temperature of the body of the two defenders xl ) . as a further proof against any possible influence of temperature or ir irradiation on the number of bubbles in the defenders",
    ", we checked that at equal temperature of the solution in the vessel , and equal ultrasonic power , the bubble distribution in the defender xl did not show any systematic concentrations ( qualitatively and quantitatively in term of number of bubbles ) near the warmest part of the vessel and in the surroundings where possible thermal gradients might have had some effect on the stability of the detectors .",
    "let us remark that in the second investigation one got evidence for neutron emission also in cavitating pure water , unlike the case of the first one .",
    "this is obviously due to the higher sensitivity of the detectors employed in the second investigation .",
    "such a result agrees with the indirect evidence for neutron emission obtained in the first experiment of water cavitation , in which the changes in concentration of the stable elements occurred with a variation in neutron number  @xcite .",
    "a difference between the two series of cavitations is provided by the different amount of neutron doses in the two cases . actually ( as it can be seen by comparing fig.[graphs1 ] with figs.[chloride graph 1 ] , nitrate graph ) the neutron doses yielded by cavitation in the experiments of the first investigation are nearly one order of magnitude higher than the neutron doses yielded by cavitation in the second one ( indeed , in the last cavitation run we got a maximum of ( 28.0 @xmath64 7 ) @xmath100 ) .",
    "this fact is even more puzzling since one would expect higher doses in those experiments carried out with a greater amplitude and hence higher ultrasonic power .",
    "a possible explanation can be found in the different immersion depth of the sonotrode in the solution .",
    "indeed , the immersion depth in the first investigation , about 6 @xmath78 , was just chosen in order to get the cavitation process more effective . however",
    ", this circumstance needs further researches in new experiments , in which neutron emission be studied as a function of the immersion depth of the sonotrode , by investigating both how the sonotrode tip wears out ( in connection with its oscillation mode , first or second bessel harmonic ) and how the piezoconvective motions of the cavitated liquid go on .    at the light of the above results",
    ", we can say that _ the cavitating device behaves as an ultrasonic nuclear reactor .",
    "_ as we have already said , we performed measurements of the ionizing radiation by means of the above mentioned ( filtered and unfiltered ) geiger counters .",
    "the measured radiation was always compatible with the background level .",
    "as a further check of the absence of @xmath21 radiation , we carried out , in absence of cavitation and during cavitation of iron nitrate ( 70% amplitude , concentration @xmath910 @xmath67 , duration 90 @xmath10 ) , simultaneous measurements by means of the two geigers and through a tallium ( tl ) activated , sodium iodine ( nai ) , @xmath21-ray spectrometer .",
    "we found again a perfect compatibility between the background spectrum and that during cavitation both for the two geigers and for the nai ( tl ) , @xmath21-ray spectrometer ( in spite of the neutron signal with maximum of ( 9.1 @xmath64 0.5 ) @xmath100 measured by the defender xl s ) .",
    "thus , the results of the second investigation too provided evidence for the emission of anomalous nuclear radiation , since neutrons were not accompanied by gamma rays .",
    "the nai(tl ) spectrometer allowed us to increase by several orders of magnitude the accuracy and sensitivity of gamma ray detection . despite that , we need again to raise the question about the lack of gamma rays from neutron capture by the proton of hydrogen which need to be addressed in future experiments .",
    "the systematic analysis carried out by cavitating water solutions of iron nitrate , for all of which evidence of neutron radiation was gotten , shows that _ the phenomenon is perfectly reproducible_. moreover , we have been able , by changing the immersion depth of the sonotrode tip , to reduce the emitted neutron dose by one order of magnitude .",
    "this implies that _ neutron emission can be somehow controlled .",
    "_      in the previous two investigations , the evidence for neutron emission was highlighted by means of the detectors defender through the analysis of the bubble signals . as a further check",
    ", we carried out a further experiment utilizing not only the defender xl s but also boron - screened cr39 detectors .    by the same experimental apparatus used in the second investigation",
    "( see fig.[2 layout ] ) , we subjected to cavitation 250 @xmath74 of a water solution of iron chloride ( fecl@xmath97 ) with concentration 10 @xmath67 .",
    "the cavitation lasted 90 @xmath10 at the ultrasound frequency of 20 @xmath11 , with oscillation amplitude of 70% of the maximum amplitude , corresponding to a power of 130 @xmath109 ( namely to a total energy of 0.70 @xmath107 ) .",
    "the choice to use again a solution of fecl@xmath97 was due to the fact that , all the other conditions being equal , we noted that with iron chloride there is a higher release of macroscopic energy than with iron nitrate ( the liquid evaporation is from 2 to 5 times that observed with the latter solution ) . due to the equality of thermodynamical conditions ,",
    "this can not be explained in terms of ultrasounds only .",
    "the two unscreened lateral defender xl s ( c and e ) measured a maximum dose of neutrons of 14.5 @xmath100 , 4 times higher than the detector thermodynamic noise of 3.5 @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , we placed , externally to the cavitation chamber , two pairs of 1 @xmath78 by 1 @xmath78 plate cr39 detectors ( r , s and t , u ) as shown in fig.[cr39 ] .",
    "each plate was at a distance of about 4 @xmath78 from the vertical axis of the cavitation chamber , at the same level of the sonotrode tip . in between the cr39 plates and the axis of the vessel",
    "there were 3.5 @xmath78 of solution , 2 @xmath110 of borosilicate glass and about either 3 @xmath92 of air or 3 @xmath92 of boron .",
    "the two couples were diametrically opposite to each other . in each pair ,",
    "a cr39 was in air ( s and t ) , whereas the other detector was immersed in boron ( r and u ) ( whose interaction with neutrons gives rise to alpha radiation to which cr39 are sensitive ) .",
    "the results obtained are displayed in the second and third row of fig.[crtraces ] . by the boron cr39",
    "we were able to detect neutrons with energies below 10 @xmath83 too and , above all , thermal neutrons .    _ _  ( upper row : magnification x 10 - lower row : magnification x 50 ) , the second and third columns show the two boron - cr39 detectors that were next to the cavitation chamber during the application of ultrasounds ( upper row : magnification x 10 - lower row : magnification x 50).__,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in order to have an idea of what the traces should look like on these detectors after etching , four more detectors were irradiated by neutrons using as source the fast neutron nuclear reactor tapiro at casaccia enea rome .",
    "the neutron equivalent dose conveyed onto the detectors was 2.1 @xmath111 through a diagnostic neutron channel .",
    "a boron cr39 was used to measure the background level around the reactor , other two , one in air and the other immersed in boron , were placed at about 3 @xmath50 from the reactor core and radiated for 5 @xmath10 .",
    "the results are shown in the first column of fig.[crtraces ] .",
    "the boron - cr39 with code e89627 was placed with its detecting surface orthogonal to the neutron channel of the nuclear reactor tapiro with its centre on the channel axis .",
    "it clearly shows the expected tracks at its centre ( a 50 magnification photo is presented as well for a better vision ) .",
    "the other three cr39 used to measure the background around the nuclear reactor do not show any thick track and the number of tracks on them is much lower than that on the e89627 .",
    "the cr39 detectors with code h40502 and h40514 were used during cavitation and show tracks absolutely compatible with that produced by the neutrons of the nuclear reactorc for 4.5 hours according to the specifications given by the firm fgm ambiente which provided them.].the comparison between the traces produced by neutrons in the cr39 immersed in boron in the nuclear reactor case ( first column ) and in the ultrasound one ( second and third column ) shows that their pattern ( although not their extension ) is perfectly similar .",
    "it is also possible to notice that the area of the thick trace produced by the reactor neutrons is about half of the areas of the thick traces produced by the neutrons generated by ultrasounds during cavitation .",
    "the boron - cr39 detectors can reveal neutrons of any energy .",
    "while fast neutrons are not affected by boron and leave their own traces on the polycarbonate surface , slow neutrons and , above all , thermal neutrons , are converted into alpha particles by interacting with boron-10 ( @xmath112b ) ( according to @xmath113b(n,@xmath18)@xmath114li ) and through this mechanism produce a much wider and deeper trace on the polycarbonate surface than fast neutrons . by using this fact and comparing",
    "the cr39 traces obtained in this experiment ( compatible with equivalent doses of 4 - 5 @xmath79 in 90 minutes ) , with the bubble signals collected by the defender xl s in this same experiment ( 14.5 @xmath100 in 90 minutes ) , and with those by the defenders of the first investigation ( between 80 and 100 @xmath100 in 90 minutes ) , we are allowed to conclude that the bulk of the neutron emission corresponds to neutrons having energy in the low epithermal range and even lower .",
    "we believe that the outcomes shown by the photos in fig.[crtraces ] represent a fairly sound proof to corroborate our heuristic hypothesis about the emission of neutrons in bursts . of course",
    ", the reactor channel acted as a filter which selected those neutrons with velocity almost parallel to the channel axis .",
    "in fact , the distribution of the tracks on the central part of the plate e89627 is nearly circular around the thick track , implying that the emission of neutrons from the reactor core was constant and isotropic .",
    "this is the consequence of the cylindrical channel through which it was irradiated , that produced a neutron flux with a cylindrical symmetry . on the contrary , despite the cylindrical symmetry of our experimental equipment ( the vessel and the sonotrode ) , it is quite clear that the neutron emission during cavitation was neither constant nor isotropic .",
    "were it isotropic , one would have got a more uniform distribution of traces and more thick traces on the cr39 plates and a more uniform distribution of bubbles in the defenders .",
    "conversely , the other two cr39 ( h40502 and h40514 ) do not show any particular distribution of tracks consistent with the lack of any preferred direction of neutron emission from the volume where cavitation was taking place . despite that , on the two cr39 detectors there are two thick tracks at the centre of the chips which perpendicularly faced the centre of the cavitation volume .",
    "this difference can be considered as a strong hint to state that the neutron emission is not continuous but , conversely , takes place in bursts at different instants of time , along diverse space directions and with different height and energy spectrum ( like is the case for sonoluminescence ) .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that the microscopical mechanism underlying neutron emission is bubble collapse , which is governed by quite a few variables ( yet uncontrolled ) , like bubble dimension , quantity and type of atoms on the bubble surface .",
    "we got a definite proof of the emission of neutrons in bursts in our third investigation .",
    "having achieved several positive evidences of neutron emission from cavitation , we decided to refine our research by performing the same measurements by a boron triflouride detector @xcite .",
    "we cavitated 250 @xmath74 of a solution of iron chloride fecl@xmath97 by applying to it 130 stable @xmath5 of ultrasonic mechanical vibration at 20 @xmath11 for 90 minutes , employing the same sonotrode and the same cavitation chamber of the precvious investigations .",
    "the immersion of the sonotrode in the solution was 5 @xmath78 . during cavitation , we measured neutron emission by a wedholm medical 2222a boron trifluoride neutron monitor  @xcite and ionizing radiation ( in particular gamma radiation ) by an umo lb 1236 monitor ,",
    "whose energy range is from 30 @xmath83 up to 2 @xmath7 and which gives both the equivalent dose and the equivalent dose rate in a wide range from 50 @xmath115 up to 10 @xmath116  @xcite .",
    "the umo1236 was calibrated by a cobalt-60 standard source .",

    "the bf@xmath106 neutron monitor was placed in contact with the shielding box containing the ambe source , and its position was such to present to the neutron flux a geometrical effective surface of 142 @xmath119 perpendicular to it .",
    "we registered the number of counts from the bf@xmath97 within 100 seconds .",
    "many of these counting runs were carried out ( sample size @xmath16 30 ) and we found out that the mean number of counts within 100 @xmath60 was 100 @xmath102 15 ( mean @xmath64 standard deviation ) i.e. about 1  per second ( 1 @xmath120 ) .",

    "_ _ @xmath126,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    let us analyse the results depicted in fig.[graphic ] .",
    "the graphic is divided into two parts by a vertical line ( at 92 minutes instead of 90 minutes for mere visual convenience ) .",
    "the left side from 0 to 90 minutes is the interval of time during which cavitation was on .",
    "the right side from 90 to 180 minutes is the interval of time during which cavitation was off , but the neutron measurement went on . on both sides ,",
    "some peaks stand well above the background level , pointing out that _ the emission of neutrons is not constant in time , but occurs in bursts of neutrons or better in pulses , thus definitely confirming our heuristic hypothesis_. moreover , we performed a careful statistical analysis of the pulse values collected in the different cavitation runs , in order to verify that they were not normally distributed , by exploiting the graphical method called normal probability plot .",
    "the values of the flux of the neutron pulses showed in no way to have a gaussian distribution .",
    "this shows that the neutron pulses are not equal pulses emitted at different times in different directions , but _ they are different _ indeed .    in the left side of fig.[graphic ] , the first neutron pulse occurs after 40 minutes from the beginning of the cavitation and this circumstance was the same for all the cavitation runs .",
    "more precisely , it turned out that in all cavitation runs the first neutron pulse appeared 40 - 50 minutes after switching on the ultrasounds .",
    "_ this is a further confirmation of the threshold behaviour in time ( and therefore in energy ) of the neutron emission . _ as to the right side of fig.[graphic ] , although the cavitation was turned off and hence one would expect that the neutron pulses would stop along with it , there are two more peaks well above the background level .",
    "these delayed pulses , emitted in all cavitation runs about 20 minutes after the cavitation had been stopped , are a hysteretic behaviour . a possible candidate explanation to this fact is that some of the piezonuclear acoustic neutrons ( those emitted during cavitation ) had been absorbed most likely by the carbon contained both in the steel sonotrode and in the materials of the supporting platforms , and released after a latency ( of about 20 minutes in our case ) , as it normally occurs in the graphite of nuclear reactors .    before drawing some conclusions ,",
    "it is worth stressing some points that , in our opinion , are important in order to create as a clear and thorough picture of this new phenomenon as possible .",
    "as is well known , there exists a phenomenon in solids called fracto - emission or fracto - fusion  kaushik , storms during which neutron bursts can be detected . however , in most cases the cracked solids are loaded with deuterium , which is not our case .",
    "moreover , that our results have nothing to do with fracto - emission has been proved by the fairly large number of cavitation runs that we carried out under different conditions .",
    "let us recall ( see subsect.3.2 ) that we cavitated aluminium chloride and lithium chloride solutions applying to them the same ultrasonic power ( i.e. the same oscillation amplitude of the sonotrode for the same amount of time ) without registering any neutron peak like those in fig.[graphic ] , so the level of the flux was always compatible with the background .",
    "besides , we performed different cavitation runs of the same kind of solution both without changing the sonotrode and by a new sonotrode for each run , in order to test possible effects due to the sonotrode aging and damaging .",
    "no correlation of aging and damaging with neutron emission was found , allowing us to exclude any possible implication of fracto - emission .",
    "the second experimental fact that we want to highlight is related to the association between cavitation and microscopical thermonuclear fusion occurring at the bubble collapse  @xcite-@xcite,@xcite .",
    "as already stated , the solutions that we used and from which we obtained neutrons did not contain any deuterium , but only deionized bidistilled water with some iron chloride or iron nitrate .",
    "besides , it seems impossible to think of h@xmath96-h@xmath96 fusion , since the two solutions of aluminium chloride and lithium chloride did not produce any sign of neutrons above the background level , although the first two had the same concentration of that with iron and all of them were treated with the same ultrasonic power for the same amount of time .",
    "the rest of the stands and racks that were used to build the experimental set - up were made of iron , aluminium , polychloroprene ( neoprene ) , polymethyl methacrylate ( plexiglas ) that being sold for the most different applications are not made of unstable radioactive or fissile elements or even less contain large quantities of light elements like deuterium .",
    "of course , it goes without saying that all the neutron and gamma laboratory background measurements were intended both to fix a level of blindness for the values that we were going to collect and also to double check the remote chance of any sort of tiny activity of the above materials .",
    "as stated above , ionizing radiation detection was carried out in parallel with neutron detection . in particular ,",
    "gamma rays were monitored by the umo 1236 detector .",
    "the neutron and gamma monitoring proceeded constantly in parallel for 180 minutes .",
    "the gamma response was both in equivalent dose rate and in equivalent dose .",
    "the variations of the gamma equivalent dose rate over 180 minutes were compared with the variations of the @xmath127 from the neutron detector .",
    "particular attention was paid in order to make out possible gamma peaks around those times when a neutron pulse occurred .",
    "neither coincidence nor correlation was found between neutron pulses and gamma equivalent dose rate and dose , which turned out always compatible with the gamma background , whose variations ( of the order of @xmath128 @xmath118 ( mean @xmath64 standard deviation ) for equivalent dose rate and @xmath129 @xmath79 ( mean @xmath64 standard deviation ) for equivalent dose ) had been extensively studied all over the laboratory .    another point",
    "we want to stress is that in the experiments on liquid solutions ( see sect.3 ) , aluminum atoms appeared at the end in a final quantity as large as about seven times the small initial quantity .",
    "more precisely , they increased from 3.99 @xmath12 to 27.70 @xmath12 , without evident reasons , if we exclude possible transmutations",
    ". therefore , our conjecture is that the following piezonuclear fission reaction should have occurred:@xmath130we shall come back to this point in sect.5 .",
    "in all our experiments , described in the previous section , the cavitated elements were stable .",
    "however , at the light of the results of the russian teams , who observed the alteration of secular equilibrium of thorium 234 due to the explosion of titanium foils in a solution of uranyl sulfate in distilled water @xcite-@xcite , we decided to check the possible effects of cavitation on the decay of an unstable nuclide .",
    "we chose as radioactive nuclide thorium @xmath131 and subjected to cavitation a thorium solution in water @xcite .",
    "the employed equipment was the same used in the previous cavitation experiments ( see subsect.3.1 ) .",
    "we prepared 12 identical solutions of @xmath131 in pure deionized bidistilled water ( 18 @xmath75 ) , with volume of 250 @xmath74 and concentration ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 @xmath12 ( part per billion ) .",
    "@xmath131 is an unstable element whose half life is @xmath132= 1.9 @xmath133 = 9.99@xmath134 @xmath10 .",
    "it decays by emitting 5 @xmath135 and 2 @xmath136 .",
    "the minimum energy of the alpha particles emitted is 5.3 @xmath7 , which is nearly equal to the energy of the @xmath18 s emitted by radon 222 .",
    "this alikeness allowed us to use the detector cr39 , a polycarbonate chip commonly used to detect @xmath18 particles emitted by radon 222 .",
    "eight solutions out of the twelve at our disposal were divided into two groups of four , and each of them was cavitated for @xmath137 = 90 @xmath10 at a frequency of 20 @xmath11 and a power of 100 @xmath5 .",
    "the surface of the liquid was free .",
    "the remaining four were not cavitated , and regarded as reference solutions .",
    "we measured the ionizing radiation in the empty duran vessel both before and after cavitation .",
    "the radiation measurements were carried out by means of two geiger counters with mica windows ( one of which equipped with an aluminium filter 3 @xmath92 thick ) , and of a tallium activated , sodium iodine @xmath105-spectrometer .",
    "the results turned out always compatible with the background level . for each cavitation run",
    ", a cr39 detector was placed inside the vessel , on its bottom , and exposed for the whole cavitation time of 90 @xmath57 .",
    "the 12 detectors cr39 corresponding to the 12 solutions were examined .",
    "the traces on them were clearly recognized as produced by the @xmath18 radiation from @xmath131 decay , on a double basis .",
    "first , such a trace has a characteristic , unmistakable `` star - shaped '' look , completely different from those impressed on cr39 by environmental radioactivity ( _ e.g. _ @xmath138 ) and by cosmic rays ( as well known from the use of cr39 counters in environmental dosimetry ) .",
    "furthermore , as a further check , we inserted the impressed cr39 plates in the automatic counter system `` radosys '' , which stated the incompatibility of our traces with those of its database ( just based on @xmath139 and cosmic rays ) .    _",

    "[ traces ] .",
    "precisely , the first column shows the four detectors cr39 used with the four non - cavitated solutions taken as reference , whereas in the second and third columns one sees the eight detectors used with the eight cavitated solutions .",
    "the circles in the figure highlight the traces left by the particles @xmath18 produced by thorium decay , which were counted . on the four cr39 used with the four reference solutions one counted 3 traces of alpha particles in all .",

    "the ratio of the number of traces and the number of solutions is therefore 3/4 for the reference solutions and 3/8 for the cavitated ones .",
    "thus , there is an evidence of reduction of the number of traces of alpha particles from thorium decay in the cavitated solutions with respect to those in the non - cavitated ones . in particular ,",
    "it is evident that the above ratios show a reduction by a factor 2 in the number of traces from the former with respect to the latter .    in order to enforce the evidence obtained by the reduced statistics of the detector analysis",

    "the concomitant absence of any variation of other ionizing radiations ( @xmath149 ) ( and the absence of neutrons ) apparently rules out the fact that the effect of cavitation on thorium was simply to accelerate its natural decay process ( although this is still an open question deserving further investigations ) .",
    "the most probable interpretation is assuming that thorium underwent other kinds of transformations of piezonuclear origin , like nucleolysis or nucleosynthesis .",
    "anyway , we can conclude that our results do support the russian findings about the alteration of the secular equilibrium of thorium , and give further evidence of piezonuclear effects .",
    "thanks to some comments on this experiment raised by two research groupssvedesi , kowalski , we had the chance to clarify some points and add some more comments and remarks of our own@xcite .",
    "a remark was about the limited collection of experimental evidences@xcite and hence a limited statistical analysis .",
    "although this is true , it was not our aim to carry out a precise inferential statistical analysis in order to ascertain with a very low level of significance if the reduction of radioactivity observed in the cavitated samples were due not to chance , but to cavitation itself@xcite . to our knowledge , this experiment is the first one to treat by ultrasounds and cavitation radioactive elements and it goes along with the evidences of the russian team@xcite . actually , our paper must be inserted in the context of the evidences from other analogous experiments , in which cavitation was shown to induce anomalousnuclear effects .",
    "a further remark was raised by pointing out the failures of marie curie who , at the beginning of the last century , attempted to accelerate the decay of radium@xcite . however , by carefully looking at the experimental conditions where all of these anomalous effects ( anomalous transmutations , emission of neutrons from iron , and all of the evidences collected in 20 years of low energy nuclear reactionscarmig1,carmig2,carmig3,carmig4,carcher1,carcher2,storms ) take place and from some of the predictions of our theory@xcite , one understands that these phenomena need very precise local condition , in terms of energy density and time of release of this energy , which are not easy at all to be simultaneously achieved .",
    "from this perspective , the attempts to speed up alpha emission carried out between the end of the xix and the beginning of the xx century were very unlikely to be systematically successful because of the difficulty to make out these effects among other more evident phenomena .",
    "other remarks hypothesized that the decreasing of thorium was due to the depositing of it on the lateral and bottom surfaces of the cavitation chamber or even the lateral surface of the sonotrodekowalski .",
    "this circumstance was rebutted by pointing out that the geometry of the cavitation chamber induced convective flows that prevented thorium atoms or compounds from being adsorbed@xcite . a further remark concerned the star shaped tracks on the cr39 and the impossibility to have this shape during cavitation@xcite .",
    "in@xcite it is possible to find the details of the measurement procedure that explains why the star shaped tracks are possible . before moving to the next subject , we would like to point out that a canadian team@xcite attempted to repeat our experiment but the experimental setup , that they used , had nothing to do with ours and in@xcite we explain why this experimental setup is completely unsuitable to produce the anomalous effects that we have collected so far like those about thorium .",
    "in sects.2 - 4  we have seen that in our experiments  @xcite - carmig5 the pressure of ultrasonic waves in a liquid causes the cavitation of the gasses dissolved therein , with the ensuing production of piezonuclear reactions and neutron emissions , provided that a given time ( and energy ) threshold is overcome .",
    "such a phenomenon is naturally associated to collapse of the imploding bubbles @xcite .",
    "it was then hypothesized that the fracture of solid materials would be able to reproduce the cavitation conditions of liquids and hence lead to the production of piezonuclear reactions , provided that the materials were properly selected . in this case , one expects that the role of cavitation and the induced bubble  collapse is played by the compenetration of molecular layers .",
    "accordingly , tests were conducted to assess neutron production from piezonuclear reactions in solids subjected to compression till failure carp , carcarp .    the materials selected for the tests were carrara marble ( calcite ) and green luserna granite ( gneiss ) .",
    "this choice was prompted by the consideration that , test specimen dimensions being the same , different brittleness coefficients @xcite would cause catstrophic failure in granite , not in marble .",
    "the test specimens were subjected to uniaxial compression to assess scale effects on brittleness @xcite .",
    "four test specimens were used , two made of carrara marble , consisting mostly of calcite , and two made of luserna granite , all of them measuring 6x6x10 @xmath150 ( fig.[carp1 ] a ) .",

    "we believe that this event , albeit with the due caution , may be ascribed to the unstable failure of these test specimens and the greater quantity of energy released by p3 compared to p4 at the time of failure .",
    "figures [ p1]-[p4 ] summarise the evolution of the neutron count rates together with the load vs. time curves for the four test specimens .        experimental data from rocks tested in compression generally indicate that this is a brittle material , since it exhibits a rapid decrease in load carrying capacity when deformed beyond a peak load .",
    "when the softening diagram is very steep , or even shows simultaneously decreasing strain and stress values , the material is said to present a snap - back or catastrophic behaviour ( cusp catastrophe ) .",
    "this is in contrast with ductile materials which retain considerable strength beyond the peak .",
    "even though in the post - peak phase the load - carrying capacity of the material may decrease considerably with increasing strain ( i.e. the material softens ) , in actual practice this behaviour can be important to the overall performance of a rock or concrete structure .    in laboratory studies ,",
    "the external loading system is the testing machine . depending on its design ,",
    "the machine may have a relatively soft or stiff characteristic compared to the test specimen . a stiff frame and electronic servo - controls",
    "are required in order to observe the post - failure behaviour of brittle materials @xcite .    by programming a linear increase in axial displacement with time , the complete stress - strain curve for rock is obtained ( fig.[car6 ] ) .",
    "generally , strains increase linearly with time even though the specimens fail and the system undergoes a progressive reduction in load - bearing capacity during the process .",
    "such specimens are said to exhibit _ stable failure _ characteristics .",
    "however , if the complete stress - strain curve does not monotonically increase in strain , the linear increase can only be achieved along the oacde curve shown in fig .",
    "since the material behaviour is represented by the oabde curve , excess energy , proportional to the shaded area , is released by the specimen and the result is uncontrolled violent failure .",
    "such specimens are said to exhibit _ unstable failure _ characteristics .        for both traction and compression behaviours , the size - scale transition from ductile to brittle behaviour",
    "is governed by a nondimensional brittleness number , @xmath164 , which is a function of material properties and structure size - scale @xcite .",
    "stable and unstable behaviours , although some materials are intrinsically more brittle than others , both depend on the specimen size and shape carp2,carp3,carp4,carp5 . in general , it can be stated that energy release modalities during compressive tests depend on the intrinsic brittleness of the material of the test specimens , as well as on test specimen dimensions and slenderness .",
    "furthermore , it may be assumed that energy release rate also depends on the velocity setting of testing machine piston travel .      in this study",
    ", all compression tests were conducted through feedback control of the axial displacement of piston travel on test specimens having the same dimensions .",
    "the complete specimen collapse process was observed only for p1 and p2 marble specimens , whose behaviour was seen to be ductile compared to the brittle catastrophic failure behaviour displayed by granite specimens p3 and p4 . for the latter two , in fact , failure occurred instantaneously , without showing the descending branch of the load - time curve .    by taking into account only the positive derivative branch of the load - time curves , from the evolution of the load in the four test specimens",
    "it can be seen that failure occurs when peak compressive load is reached ( figs .",
    "p1-[p4 ] ) . the elastic strain energy accumulated in the test specimens up to failure , @xmath165 ,",
    "is given in table 4 .",

    "this will allow us to theoretically explain the different behaviour of specimens p1 and p2 with respect to p3 and p4 as far as neutron emission is concerned .",
    "this experiment clearly shows that piezonuclear reactions giving rise to neutron emissions are possible in inert non - radioactive solids , in addition to liquids . in sect.7",
    "it will be seen that in this case , too , the emission of neutrons is related to a definite behaviour in energy and time carmig7,carmig8 .",
    "another factor to be taken into account is the composition of the materials in which piezonuclear reactions may be produced .",
    "it should be noted , in fact , that carrara marble is basically made of calcite , i.e. a crystalline form of calcium carbonate caco3 , whereas in general granite is made of quartz , alkaline feldspar , plagioclasium and even biotite and horneblend , of which the last two minerals contain iron in greater or lesser quantities .",
    "the fact that the marble used in the tests did not contain iron , and granite instead did , could be another factor contributing to the phenomenon in question , by analogy with the case of piezonuclear reactions in liquids .",
    "in fact , we have seen in sect.3  that piezonuclear reactions with neutron emissions were obtained in liquids consisting of iron chloride or iron nitrate subjected to ultrasounds and cavitation .",
    "as we have seen in sects.2,3 , our cavitation experiments evidenced two kinds of phenomena : transformation of nuclides ( @xcite-@xcite ) and neutron emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us discuss such findings in connection with the results of other experiments .    as to nuclide production ,",
    "the findings of such experiments ( in particular of the first one  @xcite ) are similar under many respects to those obtained by russian teams at kurchatov institute and at dubna jinr  @xcite-@xcite in the experimental study of electric explosion of titanium foils in liquids . in a first experiment carried out in water ,",
    "the kurchatov group  @xcite observed change in concentrations of chemical elements and the absence of significant radioactivity .",
    "these results have been confirmed at dubna  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the experiments have been carried out in a solution of uranyl sulfate in distilled water , unambiguously showing  @xcite a distortion of the initial isotopic relationship of uranium and a violation of the secular equilibrium of @xmath167th ( as already recalled in sect.4 ) .",
    "further experiments are presently being carried out at the nantes gem laboratory , and their preliminary results are in agreement with those obtained by urutskoev et al.@xcite . due to the similarity of such results with ours , in our opinion",
    "the two observed phenomena have a common origin .",
    "namely , one might argue that the shock waves caused by the foil explosion in liquids act on the matter in a way similar to ultrasounds in cavitation . in other words , the results of the russian teams support the evidence for piezonuclear reactions .",
    "a confirmation of this hypothesis comes from the thorium experiment we carried out ( see sect.4 ) .    as to neutron emission , we already quoted the oak ridge experiment tal1,tal2,tal3,tal4 on possible nuclear fusion in deuterated acetone subjected to cavitation .",
    "the measured neutron flux was said to be compatible with d - d fusion during bubble collapse .",
    "some authors disclaimed the results  @xcite , others conversely confirmed them  @xcite .",
    "as to what the results of our investigations are , one would not be surprised of the controversial results and hence opinions on the outcomes of the oak ridge experiments  @xcite .",
    "our outcomes show that neutron emission is obtained by cavitating solutions containing iron and , even if in a very small quantity , by cavitating pure water .",
    "hence the effects , that we measured , must be brought about by almost thoroughly unknown mechanisms which are triggered by pressure . with this in mind , we believe that whoever tried to reproduce the oak ridge experiments must have faced unusual behaviours and results since along with the very well known and expected neutrons from d - d fusion , other unknown effects  like the existence of a time ( energy ) threshold for neutron emission  would be superimposed , thus generating confused results which do not precisely confirm the common phenomenological predictions about fusion.let us stress once again that the experiments  tal1,tal2,tal3,tal4 belong to the research stream known as sonofusion ( or acoustic inertial confinement fusion ) .",
    "it amounts to the attempt to produce _ _  known _ _ nuclear reactions by means of ultrasounds and cavitation .",
    "conversely our case is completely different .",
    "we produced _ new _ nuclear reactions ( piezonuclear reactions ) that involve heavy nuclei but do not , apparently , affect hydrogen or light ones ( at least within 90 minutes ) under unusual conditions , like the existence of an energy threshold for these reactions to happen and the apparent lack of gamma emission concomitant to neutron emission .",
    "our experiments seem also to have some relations with the research on low energy nuclear reactions ( lenr ) or condensed matter nuclear reactions storms . in many of such experiments ,",
    "neutron emission was observed without apparent concomitant emission of @xmath21 rays .",
    "we shall discuss in more detail  this point elsewhere@xcite.let us only quote for instance the recognition of the important role played by the cr39 detectors in evidencing neutron traces @xcite .",
    "in this section , we want to propose a possible mechanism able to account for piezonuclear reactions , that is constituted by the integration of two parts .",
    "one is essentially classical in nature , and based on the well - known fact that cavitation allows one to achieve an extreme concentration of energy for unit time in the collapsing bubble @xcite .",
    "the other , non - classical one relies instead on a phenomenologically grounded formalism of local lorentz invariance breakdown , mathematically based on a deformation of the minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the case of  the experiments in cavitating water.the fundamental and intriguing question to be put is : how can the pressure waves generated by cavitation trigger nuclear reactions ?",
    "the answer comes possibly from the well - known fact that cavitation allows one to achieve an extreme concentration of energy for unit time in the collapsing bubble .",
    "indeed there exist speculations on the possibility that cavitation ( in particular , sonoluminescence ) might be a viable approach to inertial - confinement fusion ( provided that the temperature attained in the process is substantially higher than that predicted by a simple thermal model , namely 10@xmath8 @xmath168 ) @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate a classical model of piezonuclear reactions , based on the above features of the cavitation process .",
    "in order to explain how cavitation can produce the energies needed to induce nuclear fusion , let us take into consideration the physics underlying the cavitation process .",
    "it consists , as is well known , in the implosive collapse of a gas bubble within a liquid under suitable pressure conditions . in our case ( water sample )",
    "the speed of sound is about @xmath169 @xmath17010@xmath171 @xmath152 , which  on account of the used frequency @xmath172 10@xmath8 @xmath120  corresponds to a wavelength @xmath173 10@xmath174 . in order to get the gas bubble to implode",
    ", the plane pressure wave of the ultrasounds must be converted into a symmetric spherical shock wave on the bubble surface ( see fig.[conv]*)*.        therefore , the condition to be satisfied for an implosive collapse is that the wavelength must be much greater than the bubble size .",
    "taking as example a spherical bubble with radius @xmath175 , this means @xmath176 .",
    "since the size of a bubble subjected to cavitation is of the order of magnitude @xmath175= 10@xmath72 @xmath50 ( see refs.@xcite ) , the collapsing condition is respected in all the three experiments .",
    "we now remark that  contrary to what previously believed  the only atoms influenced by the shock wave producing the cavitation are the ones lying on the surface of the bubble itself .",
    "these atoms are trapped by the surface tension of the bubble ( generated by the combined electrostatic repulsion of the liquid and of the bubble ) in a double - layer film at the border liquid - bubble .",
    "namely , all other atoms inside the bubble volume escape to the outside during the collapse , due to the fact that the inner pressure , corresponding to the saturated vapor pressure of water , is far lower than the external pressure .",
    "the trapping of atoms at the bubble surface is expected to be more effective for metals .",
    "indeed , it is known that usually metals and metal cations do not enter the cavitation bubble , but stay at the interface between bubble and bulk solution . at room temperature ( 300 @xmath177 )  as it was the case of all experiments  the saturated vapor pressure of water is 0.02 @xmath178 , whereas we estimated that the pressure induced by the implosive shock wave , for a transmitted power of 100 @xmath5 is of the order of 10@xmath179 @xmath178 .",
    "this circumstance entails that there is no limit to the spatial size attainable by the collapse .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the lower limit of this size can be identified with the nuclear size . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is in literature no experimental information on the value of the minimum size attained by a collapsing cavitation bubble .",
    "therefore , we can suppose that at the end of collapse the bubble dimensions become near to the nuclear dimensions , commonly about 10@xmath180 ( fermi radius ) .    as stated before , if the wavelength @xmath181 of the plane pressure wave satisfies the condition @xmath182 @xmath175 , where @xmath175 is the bubble radius , the plane pressure wave becomes a spherical shock wave symmetrically acting on the bubble .",
    "let @xmath56 be the power of the plane pressure wave , and @xmath175 , @xmath183 the radius of the bubble before and after collapse , respectively .",
    "then , the power density on the bubble before and after collapse are @xmath184/(4@xmath185 ) and @xmath186/(4@xmath187 ) .",
    "if the initial energy flux ( i.e. the energy for unit time and unit surface ) is conserved ( due to the continuity equation and to energy conservation ) , we have @xmath188where @xmath189 @xmath190 is the amplification factor .    as a consequence , the power density on the bubble surface , generated by the power of the plane pressure wave , produces after implosion a power density increased by the factor @xmath191 on the reduced bubble surface .",
    "such a factor , caused by the implosion , ranges from @xmath192 @xmath193 10@xmath4 ( when the bubble collapses to the atomic size , @xmath194 = 10@xmath73 @xmath78 ) to @xmath195 @xmath196 10@xmath197 ( collapse to nuclear radius , @xmath198= 10@xmath199 @xmath78 ) . in the three experiments we used powers ranging from 100 to 630 @xmath5 , i.e. from 6 @xmath20010@xmath201 to 4 @xmath20010@xmath202 .",
    "thus the final power density @xmath203 for collapse to the nuclear radius is @xmath2042@xmath20010@xmath205 @xmath206 , corresponding to an equivalent temperature ( for a low - density plasma ) of at least 10@xmath201 @xmath177 .",
    "we think that this power density allows a heavy - ion - fusion - like process between two parent nuclei to generate a son nucleus .",
    "when the bubble collapses and the bubble surface shrinks to the nuclear dimensions , trapped atoms do move together with the surface and come closer and closer .",
    "the collapsing surface of the bubble acts therefore as an _ _ inertial accelerator__of neutral atoms and the squeezing of the surface to the nuclear dimension produces on the bubble surface the energy required to activate the fusion . at the final stage of this process ,",
    "atomic electrons are stripped away , and a kind of heavy - ion cold fusion ( in the sense of oganessian @xcite ) can occur .",
    "let us apply the model discussed above to the fusion of europium , in order to explain the results of the third experiment ( see subsect.2.3 ) .",
    "possible candidates as parent nuclei for @xmath65 are @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "a feasible reaction scheme could be : @xmath209    where the nuclides @xmath210 and @xmath211 could come from ?",
    "a possible answer to this question can be found in the impurities lying on the surface of the sonotrode tip .",
    "the latter was shaped through mechanical tools ( lathes ) made by alloys of iron , vanadium and zirconium , introduced to harden the tools themselves . during the manufacturing , small numbers of atoms",
    "should remain trapped inside the iron lattice of the sonotrode tip .",
    "impurity atoms are more loosely bond to the iron lattice than the iron atoms , so the ultrasonic vibrations of the tip can remove them from the lattice . by the way , the possibility of the neutron excess ( see refs.@xcite-@xcite ) could be explained by the observations already made by other research groups working on cavitation - induced nuclear reactions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the coulomb barrier against fusion for @xmath210 ( @xmath212=40 , @xmath213=90 ) and @xmath211 ( @xmath214=23 , @xmath215=51 ) can be evaluated by the formula @xmath216 or also by @xmath217 with @xmath218 ( where @xmath219=4.5 @xmath20010@xmath199 @xmath78 and @xmath220=3.7 @xmath20010@xmath199 @xmath78 are the nuclear radii of @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively , and @xmath221 = 0.5 @xmath20010@xmath199 @xmath78 is the characteristic bohr - wheeler nuclear length ) .    from the power density @xmath222 on the bubble surface after collapsing from a radius of 10@xmath223 @xmath78 to the nuclear radius @xmath198 estimated above , it is possible to evaluate the energy and the energy per nucleon needed to bring about the formation of europium 138 from vanadium and zirconium according to reaction ( 6 ) .",
    "with reference to fig.[pions ] , let @xmath198 and @xmath224 be , respectively , the radius of the nucleus and the radius of the shell of extension of the virtual pions .",

    "one gets , respectively : @xmath230the mean value is @xmath231 .    in order to find the energy achieved in this case",
    ", the collapse time of the bubble must be estimated . for an employed frequency @xmath55=20 @xmath11 ,",
    "the period is @xmath232= 5@xmath20010@xmath233 .",
    "the collapse time is obviously comprised between @xmath234 ( upper limit ) and the time @xmath235 taken by the pressure wave to travel the bubble radius ( at the sound speed ) : @xmath236 . in deionized and bidistilled water ,",
    "the sound speed is @xmath237 1.4@xmath20010@xmath171 @xmath152 .",
    "this corresponds to the lower time limit for collapse @xmath238 = 7@xmath20010@xmath239 .",
    "the energy transmitted by the bubble implosion to the @xmath240 system is therefore @xmath241    one gets @xmath242 the total number of nucleons is @xmath243=90 + 51=141 .",
    "thus the energy for nucleon @xmath244 ranges in the interval @xmath245    let us notice that @xmath246 is much higher than the maximum estimated coulomb barrier for the europium formation .",
    "moreover , the range of values of @xmath247 corresponds to the energies of the direct nuclear reactions induced by photons and to the production of pairs @xmath248 due to photon conversion in the nuclear electric field , many orders of magnitude higher than the energy required to overcome the coulomb barrier .",
    "then , one can conclude that the mechanism proposed for piezonuclear fusion is able indeed to account for europium formation generated by the cavitation process .",
    "the simple phenomenological model discussed above may of course be also responsible of the results we got in the first two experiments ( see sect.2 ) . in this case",
    ", the atoms of some elements ( the decreasing ones of the first experiment ) may have been subjected to the inertial - fusion - like process due to bubble collapse to generate new elements ( the increasing ones and/or the transuranic elements observed in the second experiment ) .",
    "moreover , this mechanism avoids the need for the introduction of a nuclear shape deformation , invoked sometimes to increase the nuclear tunnelling probability .",
    "we remind , to this regard , that @xmath210 and @xmath211 are typically spherically shaped nuclei , at least in their fundamental state , so that a shape deformation would be very difficult to justify .    on the other hand ,",
    "an oganessian - like low temperature heavy ion nuclear fusion @xcite could be possible even by the following mechanism .",
    "let us suppose that there be some kind of oversaturated vapor of the @xmath249-meson ( boson ) gas , caused by the final power density , all around the parent nuclei .",
    "the @xmath249-mesons are emitted , but they are absorbed more slowly  as if they would condensate ( something like a bose - einstein condensation )  , typically after a time which , on the basis of the previous values of the energy - space - time density , we estimate as 10@xmath250 @xmath60 ( to be compared with the typical nuclear time of 10@xmath251 sec . ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the probability of nuclear interactions is enhanced and there is an anomalous increase of the nucleus - nucleus cross section .      in spite of its effectiveness in accounting _",
    "e.g. _ for the europium production , the classical model illustrated above suffers from some drawbacks we are going to discuss .",
    "first of all , it must be noticed that not all of the power from the sonotrode is concentrated in one bubble of nuclear dimension .",
    "also , much of the power put in is dissipated in other processes ( in fact , energy is subtracted _",
    "e.g. _ by sonoluminescence and by endothermic sonochemical reactions . this could be taken into account by an approximated energy efficiency factor , useful for non - sonochemical reactions ; the latter are to be identified with those reactions that involve parent nuclei to generate composite nuclei with a greater mass . moreover , a crucial parameter is just represented by the final size reached by the implosed bubble , which critically determines the energy available for the fusion ( or fission ) process .",
    "another intrinsic limit of this model is due to the very phenomenology of nuclear fusion of heavy nuclei . at energies below the barrier ,",
    "the fusion probability is low and rises exponentially with energy . at energies just above the barrier , the probability for parent nuclei to fuse and form a composite nucleus does increase further but not indefinitely . as a matter of fact , at energies of about 10 @xmath7 per nucleon ,",
    "the cross section for forming a composite system is low and diminishes at a rate of 1/@xmath252 ( where @xmath252 is the center - of - mass energy of the relative motion of the two nuclei ) .",
    "such a decrease occurs because the composite system ( for instance , @xmath253 ) , formed at such high relative energies , is a highly excited nucleus and has large angular momentum .",
    "this causes the composite system to fission instantaneously ( with a time frame much shorter than 10@xmath254 @xmath60 ) . for nuclear collisions at the energies we estimated ,",
    "the fusion does not occur at all .",
    "a possible answer to both these questions may come from the formalism of deformed special relativity ( dsr ) .",
    "it is a generalization of special relativity ( sr ) based on a deformation  of minkowski space - time , assumed to be endowed with a metric whose coefficients depend on the energy of the process considered carmig6,carmig8 .",
    "the dsr formalism provides a geometrical description of the four fundamental interactions ( electromagnetic , weak , strong and gravitational ) , in terms of phenomenological deformed metrics with a threshold behaviour .",
    "in particular , the nuclear strong metric reads    @xmath255    @xmath256 ,   \\notag \\\\",

    "let us explicitly notice that the hadronic metric ( 15)-(19 ) is not always isochronous with the usual minkowski metric @xmath262 .",
    "actually , it follows from ( 16 ) that it is @xmath263 for @xmath264 .",
    "such a case is not new ; indeed , as is well known , the same happens for the gravitational interaction , as shown _ e.g. _ by the various measurements of red or blue shifts of electromagnetic radiation in a gravitational field , or by the relative delays of atomic clocks put at different heights in presence of gravity .",
    "let us investigate the possible implications of such an anisochronism of the hadronic metric .",
    "we denote by @xmath265 the time interval taken by a certain hadronic process for a particle at rest ( hadronic clock ) the same process , when referred to a minkowskian electromagnetic metric , will take a time @xmath266 to happen .",
    "the former time corresponds to the real time felt by the particle in its local frame , namely to the proper time @xmath267 in the minkowski space deformed by the strong interaction .",
    "the latter is the coordinate time of an external observer , who looks at the process by means of his electromagnetic instruments as the coordinate ( minkowskian ) time is supported also by the fact that the energy of an hadronic process is in general much higher than the electromagnetic energy threshold @xmath268 , and therefore the e.m .",
    "metric is fully minkowskian . ] .",
    "the two times are related by the equation@xmath269such relations is analogous to that between proper time and coordinate time found in general relativity ( @xmath270 ) , the general - relativistic relation for @xmath271 becomes exactly the dsr relation ( 20 ) . ] .",
    "in the dsr case , too , the proper time _ does not coincide _ with the time measured by the local observer in the particle frame .",
    "like in gr , therefore , one has to distinguish between the _ real ( proper ) time _",
    "@xmath272 and the coordinate ( or _ universe _ ) time @xmath273 .",
    "as is well known , such a distinction is fundamental , within gr , for the analysis of gravitational phenomena ( like gravitational collapse ) .",
    "the situation reminds that of the gravitational fall of a particle toward a collapsing body . in that case",
    ", the proper time is the real time measured by the particle ( influenced by the body gravitational field ) , whereas the coordinate time is that measured by a distant observer in fully minkowskian conditions .",
    "therefore , @xmath265 and @xmath274 are related by @xmath275or , on account of the explicit form the strong metric ( 16 ) : @xmath276    eq.(22 ) provides _ _",
    "the law of time deformation in a hadronic field__. it is easily seen that there is isochronism at low energies .",

    ", the excess energy after fusion goes in deforming the spacetime region , thus leaving the son nucleus ( produced by the fusion of the two parent nuclei ) in a low - excited ( or even unexcited ) state .",
    "therefore , _",

    "let us also stress that the presence of the hadronic time deformation _ contributes also to the lowering of the coulomb barrier .",
    "_ in fact , as is well known - as firstly realized by levi - civita - in a gravitational field the time coefficient @xmath286 of the metric acts as a refractive index , so the intensity of an electric field @xmath287 is changed  into @xmath288 .",

    "namely , one has : @xmath335    let us recall that the time coefficients of both metrics of electromagnetic and weak interactions , @xmath336 and @xmath337 , are equal to each other , energy independent , and always equal to 1 .",

    "that the elastic strain energy accumulated in specimen p3 is released at the pressure wave velocity @xmath169 ( for granite @xmath352 the extension of the energy release zone results to be equal to:@xmath353    such energy release band width @xmath22x could correspond to the critical value of the interpenetration length @xmath354 assumed by carpinteri and corrado @xcite to explain the critical conditions for the catastrophic behaviour of solids in compression .",
    "this supports the assumption we made on the role ( similar to that of cavitation in liquids ) played in solids by the interpenetration of molecular layers .",
    "in fact , if one considers the elastic energy stored in the sample and the temperature equivalent to this energy together with the final pressure before fracture , the material of the sample is in a region of the phase - space corresponding to a transition from solid to liquid phase .",
    "our conjecture is that in the interpenetration layer of thickness @xmath354 the conditions are realized for a high density fluid , over - saturated but in metastable conditions . on the other hand",
    ", these locally extreme conditions could catalyse in the interpenetration band the formation of a plasma from the gases which are present anyway in the solid materials even at room conditions .",
    "anyhow , it is also evident that the availability of an amount of stored energy for the reactions exceeding the microscopic nuclear deformed space - time threshold @xmath355 is not sufficient _ per se_. the energy must be  contained in a space and time ( and energy ) hypervolume such that @xmath356 , i.e. , such that the phenomenon will actually develop in deformed space - time conditions @xcite . from table 4 , in fact , it can be seen that it was @xmath357 in all the test specimens loaded in compression , but @xmath183 was greater than 1 only in granite test specimens .",
    "hence , even for piezonuclear reactions in solids , the notion of stored energy must be combined with the notion of speed of energy release as is the case for liquids .",
    "the fact that the marble used in the tests contains only iron impurities ( not more than 0.07% of @xmath358 ) , and granite instead contains a considerable amount of iron ( around 3% of @xmath358 ) , could be another factor contributing to the phenomenon in question , by analogy with the case of piezonuclear reactions in liquids .",
    "in fact , piezonuclear reactions with neutron emissions were obtained in liquids containing ironchloride or iron nitrate subjected to ultrasounds and cavitation  ( see sect.3 ) .",
    "moreover , we have stressed at the end of sect.3  that in the experiments on liquid solutions , aluminum atoms appeared at the end in a final quantity as large as about seven times the small initial quantity .",
    "this can be explained by assuming that iron undergoes the piezonuclear fission reaction eq.(4 ) .",
    "this should have occurred also in the compression tests on granite specimens .",
    "such a conjecture is supported also by the following considerations of a very general nature .",
    "the present natural abundance of aluminum ( 78% in the earth crust ) , which is less favoured than iron from a nuclear point of view ( it has a lower bond energy per nucleon ) , is possibly due to the piezonuclear fission reaction ( 4 ) .",
    "this reaction  less infrequent than one could think  would be activated where the environment conditions ( pressure and temperature ) are particularly severe .",
    "if we consider the evolution of the percentages of the most abundant elements in the earth crust during the last 3 billion years , we realize that iron and nickel have drastically diminished , whereas aluminum , silicon and magnesium have as much increased .",
    "it is also interesting to realize that such increases have developed mainly in the tectonic regions , where frictional phenomena between the continental plates occurred @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , let us briefly outline possible developments and perspectives of the research on piezonuclear reactions .",
    "due to the emission of neutrons in bursts , as reported above , neutron measurements during piezonuclear reactions have very peculiar features , which make them different from common measurements of neutrons from neutron emitting elements or nuclear reactors .",
    "we stated that passive detectors are more suited to make out piezonuclear neutrons than active ones , although the latter were able to detect them as well .",
    "from this perspective it would be interesting and useful to perform neutron measurements by different techniques either passive or active in order to collect as more evidences and features of these emissions as possible .",
    "it would be possible to use elements in foils like au-197 , mn-55 or eu-151 and measure their activation as a passive technique or it would also possible to use fission chambers as an active one .          referring to the experiments carried out at the polytechnic university of turin ,",
    "we have already stressed that  the  presence of iron could be another factor , together with the energy release , to be considered to account for the emission of neutrons from granite and not from marble , and to open up prospects for future experimental investigations into materials that fail in a catastrophic mode .",
    "a subsequent investigation may be conducted both on brittle iron - free materials and on ductile materials containing iron , or on iron itself . finally , after selecting the materials",
    ", it would be necessary to analyse test specimens having different dimensions and slenderness ratios , possibly by setting different piston travel velocities on the testing machine .",
    "these studies would contribute to an understanding of the influence of test specimens dimensions and loading rate on neutron emission during fracture .",
    "one can also think to carry out fatigue tests on the marble and granite samples by increasing the pressure exerted on them up the limit of fracture without reaching the fracturing of the material . in this context",
    ", it will be possible to carry out cycles of these compression tests and search for any emitted piezonuclear radiation ( neutrons , alpha , beta and gamma ) during these cycles .    instead of using ultrasounds or mechanical pressing machines , it is possible to think of applying pressure on a pellet containing iron by a process of ablation carried out by laser beams impinging on the pellet .    a further method of applying pressure could be seen in the experiments carried out by electrolytic reactors of the mizuno type @xcite .",
    "the evidence of the existence of pressure waves in these electrolytic reactors is supported by the presence of acoustic waves that are continuously audible during the operation of these equipments .",
    "it will be possible to carry out experiments by these reactors and solutions of iron salts and verify whether piezonuclear reactions are a consequence of variations of pressure in the electrolytic plasma or whether there exists any contribution to these reactions due to the local fracturing and morphological changes of the electrodes by shock waves which are generated in the plasma surrounding them .",
    "the experiments carried out so far have been focused on the detection and measurements of emitted neutrons and other possible ionising radiation . of course it will be possible to broaden our view on these effects by carrying out other types of measurements .",
    "calorimetric measurements would be of great interest in order to check the existence of extra heat and in order to have a further experimental element to compare with the homologous obtained in cmns experiments @xcite .",
    "one further interesting perspective , both on the experimental side and the theoretical one , is the chance to apply the concept of local lorentz invariance breakdown , which has been the starting point for all of these experiments and considerations , to the issue of sonoluminescence whose explanation is far from being clear .    * acknowledgments*. we are greatly indebted to fabio pistella , former president of the national research council of italy , for his invaluable encouragements , suggestions and remarks , concerning the classical model of piezonuclear reactions , the detectors and hints for improvements of the experiments .",
    "his deep knowledge of nuclear reactions and devices was very precious in order to reach deeper insights about the new physics of piezonuclear reactions .",
    "we are also grateful to him for his sharp review of the manuscript and for kindly helping us in writing some parts .",
    "we are obviously indebted to all people who supported us in many ways in carrying out the experiments : the military technicians of the italian armed forces a. aracu , a. bellitto , f. contalbo , p. muraglia ; m. t. topi , director of arpa laboratories of viterbo ; the following personnel of casaccia enea laboratories : p. giampietro , director , g. rosi , responsible of the nuclear reactor `` tapiro '' , and a. santagata ; g. ingo and c. ricucci , of the microscopy laboratory ismn - cnr and l. petrilli , of cnr - rome 1 area , montelibretti , for performing the mass spectrometry of the cavitated samples ; r. capotosto , for technical support on the sonotrode tip ; f. rosetto ; g. cherubini and l. stefani , of the laboratory cetli - nbc ; a.carpinteri , g.  lacidogna , and a. manuello of the politechnic of turin .",
