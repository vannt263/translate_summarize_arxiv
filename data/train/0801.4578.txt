    "mid - infrared spectroscopy is a useful tool in investigating the extent to which starbursts and agn contribute to the luminosity of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the infrared spectra of local lirgs have been studied extensively with isophot , isocam and sws on the @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( iso ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and more recently with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) on the @xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath1 irs has also extended these studies to fainter sources at higher redshifts .",
    "a particularly interesting population of high redshift optically faint infrared luminous sources ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) has been discovered using the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ; @xcite ) .",
    "various observing programs with @xmath1 irs have found that mips sources at flux density levels of f@xmath13(24@xmath3 ) @xmath14 0.8 mjy with optical magnitudes @xmath15 @xmath16 24 are typically at z @xmath17 2@xmath73 ( @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the infrared spectra exhibit a wide range of properties from deep 9.7@xmath3 silicate absorption features and/or strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features to featureless power - law continua .",
    "this obscured population is important in determining how much light originates from starbursts and agn at epochs in the universe when their luminosity density was at its maximum . given that their optical faintness makes optical follow - up difficult ,",
    "understanding how to characterize these sources using their infrared spectra is important in understanding their energetics .",
    "one approach in understanding the contribution of starbursts and agn to the infrared emission of optically faint infrared sources is to investigate the infrared spectra of sources also selected in other wavebands .",
    "for example , at one extreme we can study sources selected on the basis of large far - infrared flux densities , which we might expect to contain cool dust and show signatures of starbursts . in @xcite",
    ", we presented the irs spectra of 11 70@xmath3-selected optically faint infrared luminous galaxies and found that seven had large 6.2@xmath3 pah equivalent widths , consistent with them being powerful starburst galaxies .",
    "four of the galaxies showed deep silicate absorption features and their properties suggested that agn are likely to be the dominant origin of their large mid - infrared luminosities .    at the other extreme , we can consider sources selected on the basis of x - ray flux , which we might expect to show spectral signatures of agn .",
    "@xcite presented irs spectra of 9 x - ray - loud optically faint infrared luminous galaxies selected from the @xmath1 wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; @xcite ) .",
    "eight sources have silicate absorption features and one source has a featureless power - law mid - ir spectrum .    in this paper , we present @xmath1 irs spectra of 16 optically faint infrared galaxies in the botes field of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; @xcite ) which are selected to be x - ray loud .",
    "this significantly increases the number of x - ray loud optically faint infrared luminous galaxies thus far studied , and extends the sample to higher x - ray and 24@xmath3 luminosities .",
    "a cosmology of @xmath18 , @xmath19=0.3 , and @xmath20=0.7 is assumed throughout .",
    "our sample is selected from the botes field of the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of the large survey area ( 8.2 deg@xmath21 with overlapping mips and optical coverage ) and existing @xmath1 mips and irac , @xmath2 , and deep optical imaging data makes this an ideal data - set for multi - wavelength comparisons of sources .",
    "the mips data were obtained with an effective integration time at 24@xmath3 of @xmath1790s per sky pixel , reaching a 5 @xmath22 detection limit of @xmath17 0.3 mjy for unresolved sources .",
    "the resulting source lists contain @xmath2328,000 sources with f@xmath13(24@xmath3)@xmath240.3 mjy .",
    "the xbotes survey was undertaken using acis - i on the @xmath25 with 5 ks extosures over the entire botes field ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it comprises 3293 point sources with 4 or more x - ray counts , corresponding to a limiting flux of f@xmath26=8.1@xmath27 .",
    "an 8.5 deg@xmath28 region of the botes field has been mapped in all four @xmath1 irac bands by the irac shallow survey @xcite , reaching 5@xmath22 limits of 6.4 , 8.8 , 51 , and 50 @xmath29 at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath3 , respectively .    using the xbotes and mips 24@xmath3 catalogs , we selected a sample of 16 x - ray loud sources in the botes field for @xmath1 irs observations .",
    "we selected all 13 of the sources with @xmath244 x - ray counts ( f@xmath30 ) , f@xmath13(24@xmath3)@xmath24 2 mjy , and @xmath31 mag ( the `` main '' sample ) .",
    "we supplemented this sample with 3 extra sources ( bootesx13 , 14 , and 15 ) which were slightly fainter at 24 @xmath3 ( f@xmath13(24@xmath3)@xmath241 mjy ) but which were particularly powerful x - ray sources ( hereafter denoted as the `` x - ray bright '' sub - sample with 48 , 34 , and 19 x - ray counts corresponding to f@xmath32= 9.2 , 6.5 , and 3.7 @xmath33 respectively ) . because of their different selection criteria , we identify the x - ray bright sub - sample separately throughout the analysis and consider the conclusions with and without their inclusion .",
    "the basic optical and infrared properties of the sample are shown in table  [ tab:70sample ] .",
    "10/16 of the sources have fairly red optical to infrared colors and qualify as dust obscured galaxies ( dogs ) based in the criterion ( @xmath15-[24]@xmath2414 ) presented in @xcite .",
    "none of our sample have redshifts from optical spectroscopy .",
    "the x - ray properties are presented in table  [ tab : xabs ] . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the x - ray luminosities are far larger than can be attributed to a starburst and must be attributed to an agn . at @xmath35 ( the lowest measured source redshift ; see below ) , the minimum x - ray flux , f@xmath36 corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath37 ergs s@xmath38 .",

    "this may in part be due to them having accurate optical redshifts , which make it easier to identify features .",
    "it could also be due to our selection of more luminous x - ray sources , which are less likely to be heavily obscured and exhibit silicate absorption .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the fact that 6/7 of the power - law sources are also the brightest x - ray sources in the sample .",

    "@xcite show that large amounts of extinction ( a@xmath9250 ) toward the active nucleus and/or a large contribution from a starburst can cause the irac colors of an object to fall outside of the @xcite region .",
    "because our sources are largely within the agn region , they are unlikely to be heavily extincted or have a large starburst contribution to their mid - ir emission .",
    "there appears to be no correlation between the position in irac color - color space with the presence of the silicate absorption strength , again supporting the hypothesis that the silicate feature arises in the cooler gas which is traced by longer infrared wavelengths .",
    "the sources in the x - ray bright sub - sample appear to have slightly bluer colors which may demonstrate that they are less dust obscured .",
    "the irac color - color classification is expected to deteriorate at @xmath931 as the observed irac bands are pushed towards lower wavelengths in which the stellar light dominates over hot dust emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it likely holds to higher redshifts for the most luminous sources because the near - infrared emission is still dominated by the hot dust , even in the integrated spectral energy distribution .          in figure",

    "the 24-to-8 @xmath3 and 24-to-0.7 @xmath3 colors are defined as f(24:8)=@xmath94[@xmath95/@xmath96 and f(24:r)=@xmath94[@xmath95/@xmath97 respectively .",
    "f(24:r ) is a good indicator of obscuration and/or redshift .",

    "@xcite find that agn - dominated sources tend to have f(24:8)@xmath40.3 and starburst - dominated sources tend to have f(24:8)@xmath240.3 .",
    "even though the x - ray selected sources must harbor a powerful agn , their 24-to-8 @xmath3 colors suggest that the sources are dominated by a combination of agn and starbursts .",
    "we suggest that this diagnostic breaks down for obscured sources due to the heavy absorption at near - ir wavelengths which will steepen the infrared slope regardless of the underlying power source .",
    "in addition , at @xmath981 - 2 , the silicate absorption feature is moving through the 24@xmath99 filter , complicating the interpretation further .",
    "the @xmath15-[24 ] colors of the x - ray selected sources are typically bluer than that of the most extreme irs sources presented in @xcite and @xcite which typically have @xmath100>$]15 ( f(24:r)@xmath241.83 ) .",
    "the faintest optical magnitude is relatively bright ( @xmath15=23.7 ) despite the fact that there is no optical selection criteria against including optically faint sources .",
    "we suggest that the x - ray - selection is biasing us against the most heavily absorbed ( and therefore optically faintest ) sources .",
    "indeed , the sources in the x - ray bright sub - sample have among the bluest @xmath15-[24 ] colors due at least partially to their relatively bright @xmath15-band magnitudes .",

    "the grey - scale shows that this is not seen in the larger population of x - ray sources in the same redshift range , and only becomes apparent when we jointly select x - ray sources that are both infrared bright and optically faint .",
    "our selection criteria result in a sample of bolometrically luminous high redshift agn . in these cases , small observed x - ray fluxes",
    "will be associated with more obscured sources which will also have larger hardness ratios .    for our combined sample ,",
    "the absorption - dominated sources tend to have fainter x - ray fluxes and larger x - ray hardness ratios ( with a median value of hr=0.55 ) which are indicative of more absorbed x - ray spectra and larger hi column densities .",
    "conversely , the power - law sources have brighter x - ray fluxes and smaller hardness ratios ( with a median value of hr=@xmath70.2 ) indicative of less obscured x - ray spectra and smaller hi column densities .",
    "this suggests that the dusty absorbing regions responsible for the silicate absorption also contain sufficient gas to cause x - ray absorption or that both the gas and dust lie along similar lines of sight .",
    "deeper silicate absorption features may be associated with more embedded agn with higher column densities of gas .",
    "our results are consistent with those of @xcite who measure the silicate absorption depth for a sample of 85 nearby agn with x - ray data and find a correlation between the strength of the silicate feature and the hi column density .",
    "our lack of redshifts for the power - law sources means that we must compare the x - ray fluxes and hardness ratios rather than the x - ray luminosities and fitted hi column densities .",
    "any large difference in the redshift distribution of the two populations could affect our results ( for example higher redshift sources with identical x - ray luminosities will have softer x - ray spectra and smaller x - ray fluxes ) .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : pow ] , we argue that the power - law sources lie at @xmath1012.6 and there is no reason to think that they lie at significantly different redshifts to the absorption - dominated sources given their similar selection criteria .",
    "although we find a trend in the x - ray and infrared properties of these sources , the correlations are only weak .",
    "the difficulty in establishing a clear relation between x - ray and infrared properties may be explained by the distribution of their gas and dust .",
    "@xcite show that the x - ray absorbing column density of seyfert 2 galaxies varies on yearly timescales for most sources .",
    "this suggests that most of the x - ray absorption must occur on sub - parsec scales .",
    "they obtain even tighter constraints in @xcite for a seyfert galaxy which exhibits spectral variation on timescales of days .",
    "this suggests that , at least for less powerful sources , the obscuring gas is on a similar scale to that of the broad - line region .",
    "significant amounts of dust are unlikely to lie at these distances because of the dust sublimation temperatures .",
    "the difference in the location of much of the gas and dust may explain the large scatter between parameters tracing the x - ray and mid - ir obscuration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the obscuring material in dusty agn is likely to consist of both dense clumpy clouds of dust and a smoother inter - cloud medium .",
    "they argue that deep silicate absorption can only be produced in a source embedded in a smooth medium since clumpy clouds will provide direct views of portions of illuminated clouds which will fill in the resultant silicate absorption feature .",
    "since our x - ray selected sources have shallower silicate absorption features than typical ulirgs , this may suggest that they are dominated by clumpy obscuration .",
    "alternatively , they may simply have a smaller line of sight obscuration .",
    "@xcite obtained irs spectra for a sample of 7 x - ray selected agn which were specifically chosen to have large x - ray luminosities and large column densities of gas ( due to their large x - ray hardness ratios ) .",
    "given the correlation between hi column density and silicate absorption strength ( see discussion above and @xcite ) , we might expect them to exhibit deep silicate features .",
    "however , all of their sources exhibit featureless power - law spectra .",
    "the solution to this apparent problem may be that they selected a highly unusual population of sources which were both extremely x - ray luminous and x - ray obscured .",
    "figure  [ fig : xabs ] shows that although x - ray obscured sources are more likely to have silicate absorption features , x - ray luminous sources are likely to have featureless power - law spectra .",

    "<S> we present mid - infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 16 optically faint infrared luminous galaxies obtained with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these sources were jointly selected from @xmath1 and @xmath2 imaging surveys in the ndwfs botes field and were selected from their bright x - ray fluxes to host luminous agn . </S>",
    "<S> none of the spectra show significant emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; 6.2@xmath3 equivalent widths @xmath40.2@xmath3 ) , consistent with their infrared emission being dominated by agn . </S>",
    "<S> nine of the x - ray sources show 9.7@xmath3 silicate absorption features . </S>",
    "<S> their redshifts are in the range @xmath5 , implying infrared luminosities of log(l@xmath6)=12.5@xmath713.6 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the average silicate absorption strength is not as strong as that of previously targeted optically faint infrared luminous galaxies with similar mid - infrared luminosities implying that the x - ray selection favors sources behind a smaller column of si - rich dust than non - x - ray selection . </S>",
    "<S> seven of the x - ray sources have featureless power - law mid - ir spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the featureless spectra likely result from the sources having weak or absent silicate and pah features rather than the sources lying at higher redshifts where these features are shifted out of the irs spectral window . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate whether there are any correlations between x - ray and infrared properties and find that sources with silicate absorption features tend to have fainter x - ray fluxes and harder x - ray spectra , indicating a weak relation between the amount of silicate absorption and column density of x - ray - absorbing gas . </S>"
