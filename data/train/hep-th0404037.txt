    "we gradually decrease the frequency down to a minimum value , determined by the soliton stability demand . for the case of global symmetry",
    ", the smaller ( or critical ) frequency corresponds to the last stable field configuration with respect to gravitational collapse .",
    "( we also include a short range of frequencies smaller than the critical one . ) in figure [ figure7 ] the last stable configuration with respect to gravitational collapse corresponds to the top of the @xmath97 curve . for charged q - stars the lowest frequency corresponds to @xmath98 .",
    "below this frequency the star mass is larger than the mass of the free particles with the same charge , and the star decays into free particles .",
    "no gravitational collapse can happen when @xmath99 .",
    "in general , charged q - stars have larger radii and masses but a smaller @xmath100 , due to the electrostatic repulsion between the different parts of the star .",
    "they avoid for the same reason gravitational collapse , because for @xmath101 , equivalently @xmath102 , the electrostatic repulsion makes the fission into free particles energetically favorable .    figures [ figure8]-[figure14 ] refer to spacetime with negative cosmological constant .",
    "the independent parameter is the cosmological constant @xmath13 .",
    "we start from @xmath63 and gradually decrease its value .",
    "we interrupt calculations when @xmath103 for @xmath104 and when @xmath105 tends to unity for a charged q - star .",
    "the behavior of the star parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath57 , @xmath106 and @xmath100 , for 4 , 5 and 6 dimensions as a function of the cosmological constant is similar .",
    "the situation is absolutely different in @xmath66 dimensions , as we see from figure [ figure14 ] . for small values of the cosmological constant both @xmath106 and @xmath57 increase with the increase in absolute values of @xmath13 .",
    "below @xmath107 the energy is approximately constant but the particle number decreases slowly and for @xmath108 equals to the energy .",
    "below that value of the cosmological constant the star is unstable , decaying to free particles .    in four or more spacetime dimensions the total energy , particle number and radius increases initially with the increase of the cosmological constant in absolute values , but below a certain value of the cosmological constant , these parameters decrease .",
    "qualitatively , negative cosmological constant reflects a competitive effect to gravity attraction .",
    "so , the soliton mass and consequently the particle number and radius increase , in order the field configuration to be stable against this  negative \" gravity implied by the negative cosmological constant .",
    "but , when @xmath13 exceeds a certain value , no additional energy amount can deserve the soliton stability , _ if this is too extended_. so , when @xmath13 exceeds this certain value , the star shrinks , and , consequently , its energy and charge decreases .",
    "also , the value of the scalar field at the center of the soliton increases rapidly for the same reason .",
    "this happens because gravity in @xmath109 dimensions is a long - range force .",
    "the two independent einstein equations in static , spherically symmetric systems contain the @xmath110 term . on the other hand , in @xmath66 dimensions no such competition between",
    " negative \" gravity from the cosmological constant and  positive \" gravity from the energy - momentum density happens , because gravity in @xmath66 dimensions is not a propagating long - range force . also , the above mentioned term is absent .",
    "these are the reasons for the similarities in the behavior of the soliton parameters in @xmath109 dimensions and the differences in @xmath66 dimensions .",
