    "water - vapor ( h@xmath11o ) maser emission ( @xmath12@xmath13 rotational transition at 22.23508 ghz ) is a unique probe to directly investigate the structure and dynamics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on the ( sub-)parsec scale . since the brightness temperature of h@xmath11o maser emission is extremely high ( @xmath14 k ) , it is one of a few emission lines that can be observed with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . by using vlbi ,",
    "the distribution and motion of dense gas in agn can be measured on scales of ( sub-)milliarcseconds ( mas ) , where 1 mas corresponds to 0.05 pc at a distance of 10 mpc .",
    "presently , more than 80 galaxies , many of which are type-2 seyfert or liner systems , have been known to radiate h@xmath11o maser emission from their nuclei . in the active galaxy",
    "ngc 4258 , vlbi observations of the maser emission have revealed the existence of a compact disk in keplerian rotation and of a massive black hole at its nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "another evidence for a compact edge - on disk rapidly rotating was obtained from a secular velocity drift of the systemic maser features .",
    "the systemic features of ngc 4258 showed an increase of velocities with about 9 km s@xmath1 yr@xmath1 by monitoring observations over periods of several years ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , measurements of the distribution and velocity drifts of the masers led to a direct determination of the distance of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . applying this method to more distant galaxies would make an evaluation of the cosmological constants possible .",
    "other galaxies also show evidences of circumnuclear disks .",
    "position measurements of maser spots and position - velocity diagram analysis by vlbi observations have found rotating edge - on disks at the nuclei of ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) , ngc 3079 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ngc 4945 ( @xcite ) , circinus galaxy ( @xcite ) , ngc 3393 ( @xcite ) , ugc 3789 ( @xcite ) , ic 1481 ( @xcite ) , and other six active galaxies ( @xcite ) .",

    "the detected emission was near to the systemic velocity of the galaxy , and its peak flux density was 0.19 jy . @xcite detected blue- and red - shifted high velocity features , offset from the systemic velocity by @xmath20418 km s@xmath1 .",

    "continuum emission at the position of the systemic features in figure [ m+c ] ( i.e. , the galactic nucleus ) was not detected ( @xmath82 mjy beam@xmath83 ) .",
    "this is probably because that the continuum emission is attenuated by thermal absorption in a layer of ionized gas above the disk .",
    "the mass inside the radius of the rotating disk , @xmath77 pc , is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( @xmath86 km s@xmath1 ) is the rotation velocity at @xmath87 , @xmath88 the gravitational constant , and a spherical distribution of the central matter is assumed .",

    "this mass is smaller than those of ngc 4258 ( @xmath90 , @xcite ; @xcite ) by an order of magnitude , but is the same order as those of the circinus galaxy ( @xmath91 , @xcite ) , ngc 4945 ( @xmath92 , @xcite ) , and ngc 3079 [ ( 23)@xmath93 , @xcite ] . the mean volume density inside the radius of @xmath77 pc is @xmath94    blue- and red - shifted features in figure [ sp ] were detected at @xmath952661 km s@xmath1 and 30893222 km s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "if the high - velocity features except the blue - shifted features around @xmath56 km s@xmath1 ( jet masers ) are circularly rotating , the rotation velocities of the edge - on disk are @xmath96418 km s@xmath1 for the blue - shifted ( @xmath952556 km s@xmath1 ) and @xmath97346 km s@xmath1 for the red - shifted ( @xmath983222 km s@xmath1 ) . if the rotation is keplerian ( @xmath99 ) like ngc 4258 ( @xcite ) , we can estimate the radii of the maser disk to be @xmath1000.329 pc ( 0.692.60 mas ) for the blue - shifted and @xmath1010.335 pc ( 1.012.65 mas ) for the red - shifted , using the radius ( 0.144 pc ) and velocity ( 325 km s@xmath1 ) of the red - shifted feature at @xmath51 .",
    "the blue - shifted features of @xmath95 km s@xmath1 and the red - shifted features of @xmath98 km s@xmath1 have the minimum and maximum radii , respectively . figure [ disk ] shows the proposed maser disk .",

    "the extremely high density of ic 2560 strongly suggests that this central mass is a super - massive black hole like ngc 4258 [ see detailed discussion in @xcite ] .    for ic 2560 ,",
    "hard x - ray emission from the nucleus has been observed .",
    "the 210 kev luminosity estimated by correcting for absorption was @xmath106 erg s@xmath1 ( @xcite ; asca ) , @xmath107 erg s@xmath1 ( @xcite ; _ chandra _ ) , @xmath108 erg s@xmath1 ( @xcite ; _ chandra _ ) , and @xmath109 erg s@xmath1 ( @xcite ; _ xmm - newton _ ) . to see how luminous the galaxy is , we compare these x - ray luminosities with the eddington luminosity .",
    "the eddington luminosity @xmath110 is a maximum luminosity for a spherically symmetric object with a given mass .",
    "if the object radiates luminosity larger than @xmath110 , then the force from radiation pressure wins over the gravity , and thus gas can not accrete toward the central object ( black hole ) but is blown away from the surface .",
    "the eddington luminosity for the central mass of @xmath111 in ic 2560 is @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the velocity of light , @xmath114 the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath115 the thomson cross section ( @xmath116 @xmath117 ) .",
    "so the normalized luminosity becomes @xmath118@xmath119 for the above luminosities , indicating that ic 2560 is actually a low luminosity agn .",
    "a continuum component is located southwest of the rotational center of the maser disk , inclined by @xmath120 from the rotation axis .",

    "jets nearly perpendicular to maser disks have been detected also at the nuclei of ngc 4258 ( @xcite , 1998 ) , ngc 1068 ( @xcite ) , ngc 3079 ( @xcite ) , and ic 1481 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a counter jet at the northeastern side of the maser disk was not detected with the upper limit of 0.93 mjy beam@xmath1 ( @xmath44 ) which is half of the southwestern jet .",
    "absence of the counter jet may be due to attenuation by thermal absorption in a layer of ionized gas above the maser disk , if the disk is slightly inclined .",
    "absence of central continuum emission may be also caused by attenuation by the same thermal absorption . in this case",
    ", the maser disk would incline like figure [ disk ] , i.e. , the northeastern side is nearer to an observer .",
    "such relation between continuum emission and a maser disk was seen in ngc 4258 ( @xcite , 1998 ) .",

    "more sensitive observations are needed to investigate the jets and expected continuum emission at the nucleus .",
