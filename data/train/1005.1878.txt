    "the discovery of cosmic acceleration@xcite has stimulated an intensive study of models of dark energy@xcite responsible for the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "dark energy is characterized by a negative pressure whose relation to the energy density @xmath0 is less than @xmath1 . moreover , if this relation happens to be less than @xmath2 such kind of dark energy is called `` phantom '' dark energy@xcite .",
    "the breakdown of the condition @xmath3 implies the so called super - acceleration of cosmological evolution , which in some models culminates approaching a new type of cosmological singularity called big rip@xcite . while the cosmological constant ( @xmath4 ) is still a possible candidate for the role of dark energy , there are observations giving indications in favor of the models where the equation of state parameter @xmath5 not only changes with time , but could become less than @xmath2 no@xcite .",
    "there are also observations @xcite indicating the phenomenon of the phantom divide line crossing @xcite , when the parameter @xmath5 changes between the phantom and non - phantom phases .",
    "a standard way to introduce the phantom energy is to consider a scalar field with the negative sign of the kinetic energy term , usually called `` phantom '' scalar field .",
    "the simplest way of describing the phenomenon of the phantom divide line crossing is to introduce two scalar fields - phantom and non - phantom as in the so called quintom models @xcite .",
    "some other models are based on the use of the pt symmetry ideas @xcite .",
    "note that the phantom divide line crossing can occur also in models based on one scalar field if some special potential are chosen @xcite or if the non - minimal coupling between a scalar field and gravity is included @xcite .",
    "naturally , consideration of two scalar fields open wider opportunities for description of any prescribed cosmological evolution , than working with a single field @xcite .",
    "recently , another class of cosmological dark energy models was put forward - the so called chameleon cosmology models @xcite . in this models",
    "the scalar field interacts with some kind of matter , behaving as perfect fluid .",
    "the lagrangian of the model contains a term , where the matter interacts with the effective metric ( physical metric , multiplied by a conformal factor depending on the scalar field ) . the energy density of the perfect fluid is proportional to the trace of its energy - momentum tensor , multiplied by this conformal factor . on the other hand",
    "the effective mass of the scalar field becomes variable , depending on the energy density of matter , which changes in the process of the cosmological evolution .",
    "lately , an alternative version of the chameleon cosmology was proposed in paper @xcite . here",
    "the term , describing the interaction between the chameleon scalar field and matter has a very general multiplicative form and is equal to some arbitrary function of the scalar field multiplied by the lagrangian of matter , which on the friedmann - robertson - walker background coincides with the pressure of the matter .",
    "thus , one has two arbitrary functions of the scalar field to play with - the standard potential and the potential - like function describing the interaction of matter with the chameleon field . choosing properly these two functions of the scalar field",
    "one can describe different kinds of cosmological evolution , including those where the universe undergoes the phantom divide line crossing .",
    "the authors of paper @xcite use the numerical integration of the corresponding equations of motion and compare the results with the data coming from time evolution of the cosmological redshift of distant sources .",
    "we remark that having two functions of a scalar field one gets a sufficient freedom to construct exactly solvable solutions of the cosmological equations , giving some prescribed cosmological evolution . just like choosing exponential potentials one can find exact solutions desribing power - law expansion of the universe ( see e.g. @xcite ) , here one can try to construct two potential - like functions providing the existence of exact cosmological solutions , undergoing the phantom divide line crossing . in fact ,",
    "this is the task of the present paper .",
    "we consider the flat friedmann model with the metric @xmath6 the hubble parameter behaves as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is some positive parameter of the order @xmath9 and `` dot '' means as usual the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath10 .",
    "such a cosmological evolution was considered in papers @xcite in the the context of two - field models and was called `` bang - to - rip '' evolution . here the universe begins its evolution from the big bang singularity when the hubble parameter behaves as @xmath11 and ends in the big rip singularity at the moment @xmath12 .",
    "at the moment @xmath13 the phantom divide line is crossed by the universe .",
    "indeed , the phantom divide line crossing means that the relation between the pressure and the energy density becomes equal to @xmath2 .",
    "that means that in the energy conservation law @xmath14 the right - hand side vanishes , and so does the time derivative of the total energy density in its left - hand side .",
    "the energy density is proportinal in the flat friedmann model to the hubble parameter squared .",
    "hence , the time derivative of the hubble parameter @xmath15 should vanish too .",
    "the time derivative of the hubble parameter from eq .",
    "( [ hubble ] ) is @xmath16 and vanishes at @xmath17 .",
    "we shall consider the minimally coupled to gravity scalar field @xmath18 with the potential @xmath19 whose interaction with the perfect fluid is described by the term in the lagrangian , which on the friedmann background looks like @xcite : @xmath20 where the coefficient @xmath21 relates the energy density @xmath22 and the pressure @xmath23 of matter : @xmath24 and @xmath25 is some function of the scalar field @xmath18 . in the next section we shall find the form of the functions @xmath19 and @xmath25 , and the exact solution for @xmath26 and @xmath27 matching the evolution ( [ hubble ] ) . in the third section we discuss the bounds on the parameters of the model .",
    "the last section contains some concluding remarks .",
    "we shall fix the fundamental constants in such a way to give to the friedmann equation a particularly simple form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total energy density of the scalar field and matter . on the flat friedmann background",
    "this total energy density is @xmath30 the klein - gordon equation for the scalar field @xmath18 is @xmath31 where `` prime '' stays for the derivative with respect to @xmath18 . the total energy density @xmath29 satisfies the energy conservation law @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total pressure of the matter and of the scalar field which is equal to @xmath34 substituting eqs . ( [ energy ] ) and ( [ pressure ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ conserve ] ) we obtain @xmath35    using eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) we can simplify the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ conserve1 ] ) coming to @xmath36 integrating eq .",
    "( [ conserve2 ] ) one obtains for the energy density of the matter @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an integration constant .",
    "now the friedmann and klein - gordon equations can be rewritten as @xmath39 @xmath40    we have chosen the cosmological evolution described by the hubble variable ( [ hubble ] ) . correspondingly the cosmological radius @xmath26 is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a positive constant .",
    "now we can rewrite the matter energy density @xmath43 as @xmath44 where we have introduced a new constant @xmath45 the term @xmath46 in the right - hand side of the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann2 ] ) now looks as @xmath47    now , the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ friedmann2 ] ) behaves as @xmath48 . if we would like the contribution of the kinetic term of the scalar field @xmath49 to have the same structure we should require that the time dependence of the scalar field is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant to be determined",
    "then , we shall look for the time dependence of the potential @xmath52 in the form @xmath53 we shall try to find time dependence of the function @xmath54 from the relation @xmath55 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ hubble ] ) , ( [ scalar ] ) , ( [ potential ] ) and ( [ f ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ friedmann2 ] ) we obtain the following constraints on the constants : @xmath56 @xmath57    now , let us consider the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg1 ] ) .",
    "the second time derivative of the scalar field is @xmath58 the `` friction '' term is @xmath59 the derivative of the potential is @xmath60 and the term , including the interaction with matter is @xmath61 now , substituting the expressions ( [ kg1])([kg5 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ kg1 ] ) we obtain the following constraints : @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 the last condition ( [ constraint3 ] ) coincides with ( [ constraint0 ] ) .",
    "now we can solve the constraints and find the relations between the parameters .",
    "we shall choose as free parameters the amplitude of the scalar field @xmath51 and the `` quantity of matter '' @xmath65 .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) and ( [ constraint2 ] ) we find @xmath66 then from eq .",
    "( [ constraint0 ] ) follows @xmath67 from eqs .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) and ( [ constraint1 ] ) we find @xmath68 and @xmath69    we should also now express the time parameter @xmath10 in terms of the scalar field @xmath18 .",
    "it follows immediately from eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) that @xmath70    substituting the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 from eqs .",
    "( [ v1])(v0 ) and the expression for the time parameter @xmath10 from eq .",
    "( [ time - phi ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ potential ] ) and ( [ f ] ) we find the explicit expressions for the potential @xmath19 and the function @xmath25 : @xmath73 @xmath74",
    "the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath75 are given by the cosmological dynamics of the model ( [ hubble ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is free . without loosing generality",
    "we can choose it positive . correspondingly the value of the scalar field @xmath18 ( see eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) ) runs from @xmath76 at the big bang beginning of the cosmological evolution to @xmath77 at its end at the moment @xmath12 when it encounters the big rip singularity .",
    "it crosses the zero value at @xmath17 , i.e. at the moment of the phantom divide line crossing .",
    "now , looking at the expression for the function @xmath25 describing the interaction between the chameleon scalar field and the matter , we see that it is well defined only if the expression , which should be elevated into the power @xmath78 is always positive , or if the parameter @xmath21 satisfies some additional restrictions .",
    "thus , we can consider two cases .",
    "+ the case i. the expression in the bracket in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) is always positive .",
    "it is possible if and only if @xmath79 @xmath80 then if the parameter @xmath81 and @xmath82 the potential @xmath19 is always negative .",
    "if @xmath81 and @xmath83 the potential @xmath19 changes sign at @xmath84 if @xmath85 the potential is always negative .    the case ii .",
    "if at least one of two inequalities ( [ ineq ] ) , ( [ ineq1 ] ) is broken the expression for @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) can not be always nonnegative .",
    "hence , we should impose a following condition on the factor @xmath21 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are integers . in this case the expression for @xmath54 is well defined .",
    "the sign of the potential depends on the interplay of three parameters @xmath90 and @xmath8 .",
    "we have constructed an exact solution for a particular chameleon cosmological model of the type considered in paper @xcite .",
    "the universe in this solution begins its evolution from big bang singularity , undergoes a phantom divide line crossing and ends in the big rip singularity .",
    "the two potential - like functions of the chameleon scalar field have a rather simple analytic form .",
    "note that this form is simpler than the potential functions in two - scalar model , providing the same cosmological evolution @xcite .",
    "thus , we hope that our version of the chameleon model can be useful for the analysis of the phantom divide line crossing phenomenon .",
