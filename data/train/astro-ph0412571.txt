    "lyman @xmath0 emission plays an important role in the excitation of gas in h ii regions .",
    "paradoxically , this role is so important that very little lyman @xmath0 emission should escape to be observed .",
    "the mean free path of a lyman @xmath0 photon in a typical h ii region is so small that many scatterings should occur before leaving the region ( the standard  case b \" of photoionization calculations ) , with line photons escaping either when they are emitted or scattered near enough to the region s boundary , or shifted enough in frequency to increase the mean free path .",
    "this process , resonant trapping , means that lyman @xmath0 photons have a much greater probability of being absorbed by grains or converted to lower - energy line or two - photon emission than do photons in the adjacent continuum , so that we would expect to see virtually no line emission escaping from star - forming regions .",
    "such calculations were set out in detail by auer ( 1968 ) and bonilha et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , showing both how effectively resonance - line photons are destroyed in static media , and how strongly expansion of the medium enhances their escape . indeed , in the static case ,",
    "lyman @xmath0 escape into surrounding neutral gas may serve only to backscatter the line photons into the ionized region again , further increasing the odds of their absorption by grains ( chen & neufeld 1994 ) . from these considerations ,",
    "a simple model of gas in star - forming galaxies would predict emerging lyman @xmath0 only from a thin outer shell plus photons far enough into the line wings to reduce the incidence of scattering .",
    "empirically , the situation in star - forming galaxies proves more complicated .",
    "early expectations that protogalaxies could be found from intensely strong lyman @xmath0 emission ( sunyaev , tinsley , & meier 1978 ) were dashed first by the theoretical realization of how important scattering effects could be , and then by the widespread failure to find high - redshift line emitters as powerful as simple predictions based on star - formation rate and ionizing flux suggested .",
    "however , iue spectra showed that some local star - forming galaxies do exhibit significant lyman @xmath0 emission ( hartmann et al .",
    "1988 , giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 , keel 1998 ) .",
    "the strength of the line is not strongly coupled to metallicity , so something more than destruction by dust grains in otherwise comparable systems must be taking place .",
    "hst spectroscopy of small regions within star - forming galaxies has shown a similar diversity , with some showing net emission equivalent widths as large as 70   , and some showing no detectable emission superimposed on the stellar and interstellar - medium absorption ( lequeux et al .",
    "1995 , thuan & izotov 1997 ) .",
    "it is especially noteworthy that the very low - metallicity galaxies i zw 18 and sbs 0335 - 052 show only net lyman @xmath0 absorption ( kunth et al .",
    "1994 , thuan & izotov 1997 ) , again showing that additional factors govern the observability of this line .",
    "strong lyman @xmath0 emission is common from galaxies at high redshifts , even those with no sign of an active nucleus .",
    "in fact , lyman @xmath0 selection has proven to be an efficient way to find galaxies to high redshifts .",
    "this ranges from groups of objects at @xmath3 ( pascarelle et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; francis et al .",
    "1997 , venemans et al . 2002 ) to selection of galaxies at @xmath4 ( rhoads & malhotra 2001 , malhotra & rhoads 2002 , rhoads et al .",
    "2003 , cowie & hu 1998 , hu et al . 1999 , 2003 ) .",
    "spectroscopy of large samples of galaxies selected from the lyman break shows that about 1/3 have significant lyman @xmath0 emission ( shapley et al .",
    "dynamical information has shown that some of the very large ",
    "lyman @xmath0 blobs \" seen at @xmath5 have properties consistent with very powerful starburst winds ( ohyama et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "winds offer a promising environment for the escape of lyman @xmath0 , since the backscattered photons from the receding side of the wind have the maximal wavelength shift , and therefore the largest escape probability .",
    "this shift is enhanced when the wind scatters line emission from a central source such as a concentrated starburst or agn , so that the mean wavelength of line photons is already redshifted before scattering in the wind .",
    "the blueshifted side does not have this advantage , since the most favorable scattering geometry for escape points the photons away from the observer .",
    "recent calculations by ahn , lee , & lee ( 2003 ) underline this point , tracing the strongly preferred redshifting of observed photons ; under ideal geometry , multiple line peaks corresponding to various numbers of scatterings might even be observable",
    ". further work ( ahn 2004 ) shows that widely distributed dust may be required to fully suppress these multiple - scattering peaks , and yield the kinds of single - peaked p cygni profiles seen in many high - redshift systems .",
    "escape of lyman @xmath0 from gas in winds fits with the wavelength asymmetry often seen in spectra of both nearby star - forming regions and high - redshift star - forming galaxies . as stressed by mas - hesse et al .",
    "( 2003 ) from analysis of hst aperture spectra , the dynamics of surrounding _ neutral _ gas may be much more important in the escape of lyman @xmath0 than the galaxy s dust content , and this fact could shape our selection of high - redshift galaxies from line emission strongly in favor of objects with global winds .",
    "this recognition further complicates the situation in star - forming galaxies ; global starburst winds give ample amounts of outflowing gas , but these winds can be so hot as to have a very small and patchy neutral component .",
    "understanding where and how lyman @xmath0 emission escapes from star - forming systems is thus important for our interpretation of the early history of galaxies , as well as for the physics of the interstellar medium .",
    "however , spatially resolved measurements of lyman @xmath0 from nearby galaxies present formidable challenges .",
    "geocoronal lyman @xmath0 emission compromises detections at very low redshifts , while foreground absorption from the milky way s own h i can affect measurements of galaxies with redshifts up to several hundred km s@xmath2 along many lines of sight .",
    "the lack of suitable narrowband filters has made spectroscopic approaches the most effective way to seek line emission .",
    "a handful of objects were observed using iue , as noted above , and further spectroscopy of compact galaxies and individual star - forming regions using the instruments on board hst has given detections and line profiles in several instances ( kunth et al .",
    "1998 , lequeux et al .",
    "1995 , mas - hesse et al .",
    "2003 ) . in each case",
    ", the emission shows a p cygni profile , even when stellar background light is not an issue , implicating kinematic processes in what we can see of lyman @xmath0 .    a scanning observation of m33 by _ voyager 2 _ ( keel 1998 ) , with one dimension of spatial information , showed diffuse lyman @xmath0 emission with no peak at the location of the very luminous h ii region ngc 604 , leading to the conjecture that the line arises in the diffuse interstellar medium rather than from individual h ii regions .",
    "more recently , mas - hesse et al . (",
    "2003 ) have used hst spectroscopy to trace the extent of p cygni structures and wavelenght shifts in star - forming galaxies .",
    "the new uv imaging capabilities brought by hst s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) have been exploited by kunth et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to attempt imaging of lyman @xmath0 emission in nearby star - forming systems , an approach complemented by the spectroscopic technique used here .",
    "this paper describes the use of slitless lyman @xmath0 spectroscopy , with acompanying images in the continuum and h@xmath0 , to examine the spatial and velocity structure of lyman @xmath0 emission from a luminous starburst galaxy .",
    "strong radiative - transfer signatures are seen , and the line emission comes from the far side of a starburst wind , probably a global superwind .",
    "this fits with less direct evidence from high - redshift galaxies , and suggests that such winds were commonplace in the early universe .",
    "mkn 357 ( pg 0119 + 229 ) is a promising system in which to study the escape of lyman @xmath0 emission from star - forming galaxies .",
    "its optical emission lines show the line ratios of a starburst , at redshift @xmath6 and thus well beyond contamination of its emission by lyman @xmath0 absorption from gas in the milky way .",
    "ground - based imagery shows a close companion and extensive , asymmetric h@xmath0 emission .",
    "an archival iue observation ( keel 1998 ) shows very strong lyman @xmath0 emission , guaranteeing enough signal to trace its spatial as well as velocity structure using hst .",
    "as one of the uv - brightest starbursts at such redshifts , mkn 357 has also been a high - priority fuse target to seek emerging lyman - continuum radiation .",
    "i present here a four - way test for the roles of resonant trapping and velocity structure in the escape of lyman @xmath0 .",
    "a slitless spectrum around lyman @xmath0 provides both the spatial and spectral structure of escaping line photons .",
    "an h@xmath0 image shows the distribution of ionized gas , to distinguish the roles of radiative transfer and structure in the gas .",
    "the impact of dust extinction can be assessed from comparison of broad - band uv and red - light images .",
    "these continuum images also show where potential ionizing clusters are , and thus distinguish roles for an outflow wind and discrete h ii regions in the ionized gas . a ground - based spectrum covering h@xmath0 sets the redshift zero point in assessing the velocity dependence of the escape of lyman @xmath0 .    using h@xmath7=70 km",

    "this offset , well within the fwhm of the passband and retaining about 90% of the peak transmission , allowed mkn 357 to be observed on the pc ccd , with nearly nyquist sampling of the image at this wavelength .",
    "a total of 1577 seconds exposure was obtained in two images ( with the second terminated by a guiding  loss of lock \" shortly before its scheduled end ) , which were combined for cosmic - ray rejection .",

    "the galaxy was approximately centered in the pc ccd for this image , again taking advantage of its better sampling on a bright target .",
    "this pointing included the companion ( or tail ) of mkn 357 , which fell off the chip in the h@xmath0 images .",
    "alignment of the broad- and narrow - band images at the same telescope orientation should be a pure translation except for effects of optical distortion .",
    "indeed , an image shift matches the structures in common as well as the difference image will show , without incurring the additional loss in resolution in resampling to correct for the small differential distortion between the two image locations .",
    "the continuum image was scaled for subtraction using the integrated h@xmath0 and [ n ii ] equivalent widths from the int spectrum ( section 2.4 ) , weighted by the lrf passband shape . to the approximation that all line emission within the f702w passband is included in the lrf filter , the two exposures contain enough information to separate the two contributions by linear combinations in which the constants are set by the relative filter widths and exposure times .",

    "the systemic emission - line redshift from h@xmath0 is @xmath23 , with the uncertainty derived from changes when different assumptions about the relative widths of h@xmath0 and the partially overlapping [ n ii ] lines are used .",
    "the spectrum also shows a small net velocity gradient , of observed amplitude 53 km s@xmath2 across the 18 \" span of detected emission , with the northwestern side receding . no line emission from the companion to the southeast",
    "was detected in this spectrum .",
    "this spectrum gives integrated equivalent widths ( in the observed frame ) of 242    for h@xmath0 and 30    for [ n ii]@xmath24 . the profile of h@xmath0 is best represented as the sum of two components with gaussian fwhm of 3.3 and 10.2    ( 140 and 442 km s@xmath2 ) , with intensity ratio 1.9:1 . in light of the wfpc2 h@xmath0 imagery , the broader component might reflect emission from escaping wind material .",
    "however , shock ionization in such an outflow is not important in the integrated line ratios , with [ o i]/h@xmath0=0.02 and [ s ii]/h@xmath0=0.16 , neither of which is an unusual value for h ii regions or young starbursts .",
    "this suggests that line emission from a wind is dominated either by _ in situ _ photoionization or line emission scattered from dust in the wind .",
    "the optical emission lines allow an estimate of the current gas - phase metallicity , using the traditional bright - line approach ( pagel et al .",

    "this is in the range seen nearby in such small starburst systems as ngc 1569 ( e.g. , devost , roy , & drissen 1997 ) .",
    "ground - based imaging suggested that mkn 357 was an inclined disk system with tidal tail and companion .",
    "these new data show a much more irregular structure , clearly not a normal spiral galaxy .",
    "the companion , about 12 `` away in projection ( 12.3 kpc ) does not show a central concentration , having a few diffuse bright knots within an amorphous glow that blends into the bridge connecting it to mkn 357 itself .",
    "two potential star clusters appear within the tidal debris around this bridge .",
    "these features are shown in fig .",
    "1 , comparing uv and red images .",
    "mkn 357 is not a very large galaxy ; half the @xmath18-band light is emitted within a projected radius of 0.9 '' ( 0.94 kpc ) , while the wfpc2 @xmath18 image detects continuum light out to only a 6.5-kpc radius along the most extensive directions .",
    "mkn 357 falls in the range of size and luminosity often associated with blue compact dwarf galaxies .    within mkn 357 ,",
    "both the uv and @xmath18 images reveal a rich population of luminous star clusters , concentrated to the center , further evidence of its starburst nature .",
    "local starburst systems are often taken as analogs of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this is probably useful as regards high levels of energy input from star - forming regions , but will not generally be accurate in detail , since even rather quiescent galaxies today incorporate the heritage of a hubble time s worth of gradual ism enrichment and , quite likely , episodic infall of less - processed material .",
    "further detail in the structure and history of mkn 357 may be gleaned from a simple tomographic approach , suggested by the work of katz - stone & rudnick ( 1997 ) on radio maps and foreshadowed by zwicky s ( 1955 ) photographic decomposition of galaxy images . in a simple system consisting of two populations which differ in both color and spatial structure ,",
    "an empirical separation may be performed by subtracting variously scaled versions of an image in one band from an image at a very different wavelength , with the purest view of one population s structure found at the largest scaling factor for which significant oversubtraction does not occur . in realistic situations ,",
    "a single scaling factor may be inadequate for a whole object , but useful insights can be gained from even approximate decomposition . for mkn 357 , the uv and r images decompose largely into two components differing in both structure and color ( fig .",
    "the bluer component includes many of the prominent star clusters ( section 3.3 ) , and shows a rounder outer shape , with typical axial ratio 0.9 .",
    "existing ultraviolet observations of prominent starbursts ( marcum et al .",
    "2001 , hoopes et al .",
    "2004 ) suggest that this component may include scattered light from grains , perhaps including grains mixed with a starburst wind .",
    "the strong forward - scattering phase function of typical grains in the uv will weight this scattering toward those in the foreground of the stars ( witt & gordon 2000 ) , so this distribution is not necessarily representative of the overall grain distribution .",
    "the redder component is much more elongated , at least in projection , with typical axial ratio 0.3 .",
    "notably , there are several star clusters which appear only in the redder population , particularly at the southeastern end .",
    "the brightest of these might represent the nucleus of a pre - existing system which has seen strong tidal disruption , or be a remnant of a previous burst of star formation .",
    "this cluster is in fact redder than the rest of this component , leaving a hole in the blue component in a decomposition which works well almost everywhere else .",
    "the continuum - subtracted h@xmath0+[n ii ] image ( fig .",
    "3 ) shows structure quite different from that seen in the continuum .",
    "the dominant feature is an irregular spray of emission , less flattened in projection than the continuum light but more elongated than the blue tomographic component , centered near the brightest star clusters .",
    "the brightest emission traces a u shape , with peaks close to ( but not centered on ) several bright clusters .",
    "this structure resembles the h@xmath0 appearance seen on a slightly smaller scale in ngc 1569 ( devost , roy , & drissen 1997 ; martin 1998 ) .",
    "however , there is not a detailed match of continuum and emission - line features ; in particular , the image does not show distinct h ii regions associated with most of the uv - bright clusters .",
    "this is a common situation in galaxies with strong and ongoing star formation .",
    "numerous similar examples appear in the collection by marlowe et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the extensive atlas by gil de paz , madore , & pevunova ( 2003 ) .",
    "the prominent dark lane in h@xmath0 does not seem to be associated with extinction , as traced either by a lack of star - forming knots or the uv / r broadband color .",
    "this again is reminiscent of ngc 1569 , where a similar open structure appears in both optical line emission and the radio continuum , so it must reflect a genuine lack of ionized gas . in that system , this can be attributed to wind sweeping ( martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ) , a picture which also makes sense in mkn 357 given the other evidence for significant outflow .",
    "these characteristics suggest that much of the optical line emission arises in a global starburst ( super)wind rather than from individual h ii regions .",
    "this wind may be reflected in the broad ( 400 km s@xmath2 fwhm ) component seen in the integrated h@xmath0 profiles ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "such an outflow may be sampled ( in part ) by the velocity gradient in h@xmath0 , which may have a counterpart component in lyman @xmath0 as well ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "in some starbursts with powerful outflows , the bipolar structure is evident only with detailed kinematics ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1995 ) , and in mkn 357 the combined lyman @xmath0 asymmetries in intensity and velocity may offer the best evidence for a bipolar outflow geometry .",
    "comparison with kinematic and morphological features seen in the gas of star - forming galaxies on a wide range of scales ( legrand et al .",
    "1997 , gil de paz et al . 1999 ,",
    "silich et al .",
    "2002 , lpari et al .",
    "2004 ) points up an ambiguity in the scale of outflows - is there really a single global superwind , or an amalgamation of expanding , overlapping shells around individual star - forming regions ? these shells or bubbles would not necessarily escape the galaxy potential ( as a wind , properly called , would ) , and would not individually extent over a large part of the galaxy image .",
    "definitive discrimination between local and global outflows would require high - resolution kinematic data or x - ray observations .",
    "weak evidence suggesting a global pattern may come from the degree or redshifting of the peak lyman @xmath25 emission and its systematic change with distance from the galaxy center .",
    "twenty bright clusters are well enough separated in these images for individual aperture photometry .",
    "these span a wide range in both brightness and color , with magnitudes @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the color range is not connected to magnitude , and spans @xmath28 to + 4.6 .",
    "one luminous red cluster is much larger than the others and might represent the core of a former interacting component . before any internal reddening correction ,",
    "the brightest clusters reach @xmath29 .",
    "this is already luminous enough to suggest that the clusters must be very young , since such systems as ngc 4038/9 have clusters only up to about absolute magnitude -14 in these bands ( whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the combination of young clusters with a lack of discrete h ii regions suggests that this system is in a stage comparable to the late - stage evolution of individual h ii regions discussed by bosch et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , when stellar mechanical - energy input dominates the gas dynamics .",
    "the distribution of lyman @xmath0 emission is well traced in the direction along the stis slit , and shows a striking asymmetry and structural differences from both h@xmath0 and the starlight .",
    "4 compares traces along the slit in these features and in the composite quantity of emission equivalent width .",
    "the emission - line flux was evaluated over a 2.1-   band , with continuum taken from a similar band just redward of the line location .",
    "this was intended to span the entire observed velocity range of line emission , but some variation in the absorption component may be included .",
    "the lyman @xmath0 emission distribution is very asymmetric , strongest on the northwestern side ( which is receding according to the h@xmath0 and [ n ii ] velocity gradient ) .",
    "the northwestern side of the emission encompasses 72% of the total , and emission can be detected three times as far from the core on this side ( where the line trace disappears into the noise about 8 \" from the core ) .",
    "the asymmetry is similar to that observed in haro 2 by mas - hesse et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "there is a narrow spike of line emission at the starlight core , but the rest of the lyman @xmath0 structure lacks continuum counterparts .",
    "broadly , this means that it does not come from discrete h ii regions around the uv - bright clusters , but from a more diffuse distribution of gas .",
    "perhaps more interesting , structures traced by lyman @xmath0 and h@xmath0 emission do not coincide .",
    "quite generally , this means that radiative transfer ( likely modulated by the overall velocity field ) dominates over either the distribution of ionizing sources or the gas distribution in determining where lyman @xmath0 escapes from the galaxy .",
    "this remains true even if nonradiative ionization ( for example , by shocks within or at the interface of the wind ) is important , since it is the difference in structure between these two recombination lines that matters .",
    "the lyman @xmath0/h@xmath0 flux ratio ranges from a low value of 0.56 ( in a broad region 0.33 `` southeast of the core ) to a high of 21 , seen on the edge of the emission region 1.43.1 '' northwest .",
    "redistribution of the line photons in wavelength during scattering is so effective that this line ratio can locally somewhat exceed its pure - recombination value .",
    "the lyman @xmath0 line shows prominent absorption as well as emission wherever the signal - to - noise ratio is sufficient , with a characteristic p cygni profile .",
    "much of the absorption must be due to radiative - transfer effects within the gas itself rather than to superposition on stellar photospheric absorption or absorption of background starlight .",
    "this is shown by the large velocity offset of the emission from the absorption core , the spatial persistence of the absorption well beyond the compact uv continuum distribution , and its change with distance from the center and thus with column density of scattering ions .",
    "the effects of this absorption on the line profile are difficult to extract without more complete information , since it may combine three effects - absorption of the continuum on stellar photospheres , absorption by foreground h i in the outskirts of mkn 357 , and an attenuation feature of continuum photons due to the large scattering cross section near the line center ( as described by chen & neufeld 1994 ) .",
    "for this reason , i concentrate here on properties extracted directly from the spectrum .",
    "these are the results which are both most robust , and most relevant to the comparison with high - redshift galaxies .    to extract peak wavelengths from the asymmetric emission line in such noisy data , a high - order polynomial was fit to the data points from 12751285   ; orders from 21 - 45 gave very similar results , with the values for 35 being quoted .",
    "the peak wavelength was taken as the peak of this fit ( noting that multiple peaks are seen at some slit locations ) .",
    "this smoothed fit incorporates all the statistically significant structure in the emission - line profile , as can be seen visually from examination of the residual pattern upon subtracting the fit from the original data ( fig .",
    "5 ) , which accords with the poisson errors for the stis data delivered by the calibration pipeline .",
    "the peak wavelength was measured by following the maximum value of the polynomial fits from one spatial increment to the next ( using the iraf routine reidentify ) .",
    "errors for this peak estimate were assessed in a monte carlo manner , from 1000 realizations of appropriate poisson errors added to the smooth fit for each line of the spectrum .",
    "the dominant velocity feature is a redshift of the peak velocity , greatest in the middle of the detected line emission rather than near the galaxy core . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the offset of the lyman @xmath0 peak from systemic velocity is as large as 250 km s@xmath2 near the middle of the emission region , declining to @xmath1 km s@xmath2 toward the edges of the detectable emission . in these regions , the emission also shows evidence for multiple velocity components , so genuine kinematic structure may be playing a role in the inferred wind .",
    "as noted above , the lyman @xmath0 emission region appears very asymmetric with respect to both the galaxy s starlight and the recombination emission seen at h@xmath0 , which indicates that radiative - transfer effects operate in a very asymmetric way . as noted above",
    ", if most of the line photons originate in a small core region before scattering , the typical line doppler shift along our line of sight will be twice the characteristic expansion velocity , due to the backscattering  moving mirror \" geometry .",
    "this analysis has treated the stis spectrum as a pure wavelength - slit position measure .",
    "the wide slit means that location of structures parallel to the dispersion may play a role .",
    "such a role is unlikely to account for much of the structure in peak wavelength , simply because it would require a large u - shaped emission region with no counterpart at other wavelengths .",
    "there is very likely a spatial component to the apparent line widths , whose extent depends on the angular span of lyman @xmath0 emission .",
    "much of the width of the lyman @xmath0 peak could arise in this way if the emission and uv continuum span comparable angles .",
    "however , the sense of the lyman @xmath0 velocity structure runs opposite to the direction that would result from resolved galaxy structure if the emission roughly follows the uv continuum light , suggesting that the velocity _ structure _ is unlikely to be compromised .",
    "one test of the extent of this smearing by spatial structure considers the widths of interstellar absorption features seen just blueward of lyman @xmath0 , of which the strongest unblended one in this spectral range is si iii @xmath30 . at the nucleus",
    ", this line shows a fwhm of 2.5   ( or 590 km s@xmath2 ) , and is slightly deeper in core attenuation and stronger overall than seen in haro 2 ( mas - hesse et al .",
    "this line shows a core - to - edge change in radial velocity no greater than 60 km s@xmath2 across 65 stis pixels ( 1.7 arcseconds ) , a span limited by the background starlight . since the lyman @xmath0 centroid changes by nearly 300 km s@xmath2 across the same locations , confusion by spatial structure of the galaxy is unlikely to be important .",
    "the sense of the velocity offset across the galaxy core is the same as that of the h@xmath0 velocity gradient , although the span and slope are much greater .",
    "the ground - based spectrum shows only a 50 km s@xmath2 range in h@xmath0 velocity across the entire system .",
    "a comparison among lyman @xmath0 , h@xmath0 , and multicolor continuum data for the luminous and metal - rich starburst system mkn 357 shows that the lyman @xmath0 emission is associated with a region which is very asymmetric about the galaxy center and likely associated with the receding half of a global wind . the remains some ambiguity about whether this might be overlappig winds from individual star - forming events , or a global wid which is no longer bound in the galaxy potential .",
    "some evidence in favor of a global superwind comes from fairly cohesive velocity structure in lyman @xmath0 emission across the galaxy , suggesting one mass of gas is responsible .",
    "these conclusions fit with the results of several previous studies ( section 1 ) in showing that strong lyman @xmath0 emission is more a sign of kinematics ( favoring outflow geometries ) than metallicity ( through the abundance of grains ) .",
    "applied at high redshifts , this means that starburst outflows are very common among lyman - break galaxies as well as the narrow - line lyman @xmath0 emitters which are common at @xmath5 .",
    "they also fit with the redshift behavior seen from various spectral features in lyman - break galaxies ( franx et al .",
    "1997 , adelberger et al .",
    "2003 steidel et al . 1998 , 2003 ) . as steidel",
    "et al . ( 2003 ) note , in the presence of a strong outflow , interstellar absorption lines will be preferentially blueshifted compared to the systemic value , while backscattered lyman @xmath0 is preferentially redshifted . since the strongest absorption features in the easily - sampled mid - uv range can have significant interstellar components , the systemic redshift can remain uncertain by several hundred km s@xmath2 .",
    "these results also reiterate that lyman @xmath0 can not be used as a simple tracer of the star - formation rate , reinforcing the arguments of kunth et al .",
    "they find knots and diffuse structures not obviously related to the sfr distribution , fitting in some cases with a wind picture . from their sample ,",
    "eso 338-ig04 in particular shows structures much like the wind in mkn 357 .",
    "comparison with these more local objects points up the role of neutral outflowing gas , which may be only a minority constituent of hot , mostly ionized winds from objects undergoing powerful starbursts , and adds further complexity to the interpretation of lyman @xmath0 emission from high - redshift objects .",
    "not only active star formation and outflows , but the reservoir of additional gas or multiphase nature of the outflow , may play significant roles .",
