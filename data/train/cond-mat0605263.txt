    "solid - state quantum information systems based on electronic spin or charge degrees of freedom offer a number of intrinsic advantages and drawbacks . among the former are the fast operation times , the possibility to scale the systems to large size , and the relative ease to integrate them into electronic control and read - out circuits .",
    "probably the most serious disadvantage is the fact that , in general , solid state devices suffer strongly from noise due to internal and external degrees of freedom as well as material - specific fluctuations .",
    "they lead to relaxation and decoherence processes .",
    "hence , one of the major tasks in the field is the understanding and control of noise and decoherence . in this article",
    "we will concentrate on the analysis of fluctuations which arise due to the discrete nature of the electron charge .",
    "they lead to what is denoted as _",
    "shot noise_. its analysis reveals information about electron correlations and entanglement  @xcite .    in many circumstances",
    "the fluctuations are gaussian distributed and fully characterized by their power spectrum . in order to get further information in the general case , e.g. about correlations and entanglement , the theory of _ full counting statistics _ ( fcs )  @xcite of electrons has been developed .",
    "it concentrates on the probability distribution for the number of electrons transferred through the conductor during a given period of time .",
    "it yields not only the variance , but all higher moments of the charge transfer as well , and thus also contains information about rare large fluctuations .",
    "the fcs has its historical roots in quantum optics , where the counting statistics of photons has been used to characterize the coherence of photon sources  @xcite .",
    "photons detected by the photo - counter are correlated in time , reflecting the bose statistics of the particles involved . for electronic currents",
    "the fermi statistics is the relevant one , but the first attempts to derive the fcs of electrons  @xcite revealed some fundamental interpretation problems , related to subtleties of the quantum measurement process .",
    "we are interested in the probability that the outcome of a measurement of the charge is @xmath0 . according to text - book definitions of projective measurement",
    "this quantity can be expressed by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the operator for the transmitted charge , and @xmath3 denotes the quantum state .",
    "it is tempting to relate the transferred charge to the current operator , @xmath4 .",
    "however , in quantum transport problems one has to pay attention to the fact that the electric current @xmath5 is an operator , which , in general , does not commute at different times .",
    "this property led to severe interpretation problems within the original work .",
    "they were resolved in the later work of levitov and lesovik  @xcite , which invokes explicitly an extra degree of freedom , namely the detector degree of freedom . the paradigm of projective measurement is then applied to this detector degree of freedom .    in the meantime",
    "the theory of fcs in mesoscopic transport has developed into a mature field ; some achievement are summarized in refs .",
    "however , the experimental analysis of the fcs remains a challenge .",
    "first measurements of the third cumulant of charge transfer through a tunnel junction have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and , very recently , the fcs of a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) has been investigated by a real - time detection of single - electron tunneling via a quantum point contact  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , threshold type of measurements of the fcs using an array of over - damped josephson junctions has been elaborated theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will review our recent results on the fcs of interacting electrons in a qd and low - dimensional diffusive conductors .",
    "the qds are basic constituents of most solid - state quantum information systems .",
    "for example , superconducting single cooper - pair boxes  @xcite and , similarly , a double - dot system formed in a semiconductor 2deg  @xcite have been shown to operate as charge qubits . a metallic qd or single - electron transistor ( set",
    ") can serve as an electro - meter to measure the quantum states of a charge qubit  @xcite .",
    "since all these devices are based on the charge measurements , a thorough understanding of the fluctuating properties of charge becomes crucial for progress in this field .",
    "recently further links became apparent between the fcs of electron transport and the field of solid - state quantum information processing .",
    "one of these is related to the use of electron entangled states for these purposes .",
    "most of the work on entanglement has been performed in optical systems with photons  @xcite , cavity qed systems  @xcite and ion traps  @xcite . by now several ideas",
    "have been put forward how to generate , manipulate and detect electronic entangled states  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in solid state systems entanglement is rather common , the nontrivial task remaining its control and detection .",
    "for mesoscopic conductors , the prototype scheme of such detection was discussed in ref .",
    "it has been shown that the presence of spatially separated pairs of entangled electrons , created by some _ entangler _ , can be revealed by using a beam splitter and by measuring the correlations of the current fluctuations in the leads . if the electrons are injected in an entangled state , bunching and anti - bunching of the cross - correlations of current fluctuations should be found , depending on whether the state is a spin singlet or triplet . in ref .",
    "@xcite the fcs of entangled electrons has been analyzed in detail .",
    "the fcs depends not only on the scattering properties of the conductor but also on the correlations among the electrons that compose the incident beam . in ref .",
    "@xcite the clauser - horne inequality test for the fcs in the multi - terminal structures has been proposed in order to detect the entanglement in the source flux of electrons .",
    "a second link is the intrinsic relation between fcs and detector properties of a quantum point contact .",
    "qpcs were suggested as charge detectors in ref .",
    "@xcite and have been studied experimentally in ref .",
    "recently they have been used as detectors for the state of quantum - dot qubits @xcite .",
    "the operating principle of the qpc detector relies on the dependence of the electron current @xmath6 through the qpc on the state of the two - level system . in ref .",
    "@xcite the detector properties of the qpc have been calculated beyond linear - response for arbitrary energy - dependent transparency and coupling .",
    "this is the case of interest since for maximum detector sensitivity typical measurements are done in the regime of high qpc transparency , @xmath7 , and for coupling that is not weak @xcite .",
    "it was found that both the back - action dephasing rate @xmath8 and the measurement rate @xmath9 are determined by the electron fcs . a further motivation to study fcs arises from the need to understand the effect of interaction on electron transport in disordered low - dimensional conductors .",
    "disorder enhancement of coulomb interaction , together with quantum coherence effects strongly influence the transport properties of these systems .",
    "the fcs analysis of this long - standing problem provides a deeper insight into the question .",
    "typically the coulomb interaction leads to a suppression of the conductance of mesoscopic samples at low temperatures and bias voltages .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that the strength of this suppression in various types of mesoscopic conductors is related to their noise properties .",
    "frequently we find the simple rule : the higher the shot noise the stronger is the coulomb suppression of the conductance .",
    "the reason is that both shot noise and coulomb corrections to the transport current are manifestations of the discreet nature of the electric charge . beyond that",
    ", it was shown that the coulomb correction to the shot noise scales with the third moment of the current in the absence of interactions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated by renormalization group studies of the fcs of short coherent conductors  @xcite and of quantum dots  @xcite in the presence of coulomb interaction that the interaction correction to the @xmath10th moment of the current is determined by @xmath11-th moment evaluated in the absence of interaction .",
    "further developing these ideas we show in the present paper that coulomb interaction may substantially enhance the probability of large current fluctuations in low dimensions , leading to the appearance of long correlated ` trains ' in the transferred charge .",
    "this effect is most pronounced when the system size matches the dephasing length due to coulomb interaction .",
    "such coincidence is not accidental and comes from the presence of the soft diffusive modes in the system which strongly renormalize the bare interaction .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows : in the next section we introduce some basic definitions and concepts of the fcs in mesoscopic transport .",
    "we discuss the paradigm of quantum measurement by using a spin 1/2 as galvanometer and consider some simple illustrative examples . in the main part we concentrate on our own contributions to the field , discussing the effects of coulomb interaction onto the shot noise and fcs in interacting quantum dot systems ( section 3 ) and in low - dimensional diffusive interacting conductors ( section 4 ) .",
    "we start this section by introducing some definitions and general formulae of the fcs approach to mesoscopic transport .",
    "the central quantity is the probability distribution , @xmath12 , for @xmath13 electrons to be transferred through the conductor during a time interval @xmath14 .",
    "the detection time @xmath14 is assumed to be much larger than the inverse current frequency @xmath15 , which ensures that on average @xmath16 .",
    "this probability distribution @xmath12 is related to the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) , @xmath17 , via a discrete fourier transform @xmath18 the auxiliary variable @xmath19 is usually called counting field `` . from the cgf one readily obtains the cumulants '' ( irreducible moments ) @xmath20 the first four of the irreducible moments , defined by @xmath21 denote the mean , variance , asymmetry ( skewness `` ) and kurtosis ( sharpness '' ) , respectively .",
    "they characterize the peak position , width of the distribution and further details of the shape of the distribution @xmath12 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .    .",

    "scheme a spin-@xmath26 system is used as a galvanometer for the charge detection .",
    "this spin is placed near the conductor and coupled magnetically to the electric current .",
    "let the electron system be described by the hamiltonian @xmath27 .",
    "we further assume that the spin-@xmath26 generates a vector potential @xmath28 of the form @xmath29 . here",
    "the function @xmath30 smoothly interpolates between 0 and 1 in the vicinity of the cross - section at which the current is measured , and @xmath19 is an arbitrary coupling constant so far .",
    "it will be shown below that it plays a role of counting field \" .",
    "if one further restricts the coupling of the current to the @xmath31-component of the spin then the total hamiltonian of the system takes the form @xmath32 .    in the semiclassical approximation , when the variation of @xmath33 on the scale of the fermi wave length @xmath34 is weak , it is possible to linearize the electron spectrum at energies near the fermi surface .",
    "thus one arrives at the hamiltonian @xmath35 , where @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the current density and @xmath38 the total current across a surface @xmath39 .",
    "on the quasi - classical level eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) shows that a spin linearly coupled to the measured current @xmath40 will precess with a rate proportional to the current .",
    "if the coupling is turned on at time @xmath41 and switched off at @xmath14 the precession angle @xmath42 of the spin around the @xmath31-axis is proportional to the transferred charge through the conductor . in this way",
    "the spin-1/2 turns into analog galvanometer .    to proceed with the fully quantum mechanical description",
    "let us consider the evolution of the spin density matrix @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that initially the density matrix of the whole system factorizes , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 being the initial density matrix of electrons .",
    "then the time evolution of @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the trace over electron states .",
    "since , by construction , the evolution operator @xmath49 is diagonal in the basis of @xmath50 , the spin density matrix takes the form @xmath51 , \\quad   { \\cal z}(\\chi ) = { \\rm tr}_e \\left ( e^{-i { \\cal h}_\\chi t}\\hat\\rho_e\\ , e^{i { \\cal h}_{-\\chi } t}\\right ) ,   \\label{dm}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian @xmath52 acts on the electron degrees of freedom only .",
    "it becomes clear now that the non - diagonal elements of the density matrix  ( [ dm ] ) contain the information about the distribution of precession angles of the spin during time @xmath14 . to make it explicit we use the transformation rule of the spin-@xmath26 density matrix corresponding to a rotation around the @xmath31-axis by the angle @xmath53 , @xmath54.\\ ] ]",

    "we have shown that in non - equilibrium situations quantum fluctuations of the charge induce lifetime broadening for the charge states of the central island .",
    "an important consequence is the reduction of the probability for currents much larger than the average value .",
