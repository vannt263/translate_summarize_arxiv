    "a central topic of hadron physics is to study the influence of the nuclear medium on elementary processes , for example by measuring meson production at projectile energies below the threshold for free @xmath5 collisions ( so - called subthreshold production ) .",
    "these processes necessarily involve collective effects of the nucleons inside the target nucleus .",
    "@xmath0-production is particularly well suited for such investigations since the meson is rather heavy , as compared to pions , so that its production requires strong medium effects .",
    "final state interactions of @xmath0 mesons in nuclei are generally considered to be rather small , due to their strangeness of @xmath10 . as a consequence ,",
    "the production of @xmath0-mesons in proton - nucleus collisions is of great importance to learn about either cooperative nuclear phenomena or high momentum components in the nuclear many - body wave function .",
    "the cooler synchrotron cosy - jlich  @xcite , which provides proton beams in the range @xmath11  gev , is well suited for the study of @xmath0-production . in measurements with very thin windowless internal targets ,",
    "secondary processes of the produced mesons can be neglected and , simultaneously , sufficiently high luminosities of more than @xmath12 can be obtained .",
    "subthreshold @xmath0-production was a prime motivation for building the large - acceptance anke spectrometer  @xcite within one straight section of the cosy ring .",
    "it consists of three dipole magnets , which separate forward - emitted reaction products from the circulating proton beam and allow to determine their emission angles and momenta . depending on the choice of the magnetic field in the spectrometer dipole , @xmath0-mesons in the momentum range @xmath13 mev / c can be detected .",
    "the layout of the device , including detectors and the data - acquisition system , was optimized @xcite to study @xmath0-spectra down to @xmath14  gev .",
    "this is a very demanding task because of the small @xmath0-production cross sections , e.g.  39  nb for @xmath15c collisions at 1.0  gev  @xcite .",
    "thus , the kaons have to be identified @xcite in a background of secondary protons and pions which is up to @xmath16 times more intense .",
    "the measured cross sections for @xmath0 production in @xmath15c interactions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_sections ] .",
    "the cross sections were normalized to known pion - production cross sections  @xcite measured for similar kinematical conditions  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath17 and 2.3  gev two data sets have been obtained for different settings of the field strength in the spectrometer dipole , @xmath18  t and 1.6  t. these two modes of operation allow to explore slightly different but overlapping regions of the kaon - momentum spectra . at @xmath19 gev ( @xmath18  t ) , anke for the first time allows to measure the full momentum spectrum of the produced kaons at deep - subthreshold energies  @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the experimental setup as well as the analysis procedures are identical for both field values .",
    "[ fig : cross_sections ] shows that there are discrepancies between the two data sets for @xmath20  mev / c at @xmath21 gev , whereas at @xmath17  gev they coincide .",
    "we conclude that there is an as yet unknown source of systematic errors , which may yield an additional uncertainty of up to 30% at the higher beam energies .",
    "it should be noted that these uncertainties vanish when one calculates the cross - section _ ratios _ for different target nuclei @xcite .",
    "thus , these ratios are used for the discussion of reaction mechanisms and final - state interaction effects in sects .",
    "[ sec : mechanisms ] and [ sec : fsi ] .",
    "table  [ tab : syst ] shows the available data on @xmath0-production in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the different data sets were obtained for non - overlapping kinematical parameters ( i.e.  beam energies , kaon emission angles and momenta ) which prevents a direct comparison with the data from anke and a test of the overall normalizations .",

    "the sharp fall - off of the cross sections from anke towards positive values of @xmath28 was explained @xcite by the fact that the data were taken very close to the kinematical limit for hyper - nucleus formation at @xmath29 ( @xmath19 gev ) which is expected to be accompanied by very small cross sections .",

    "the data from anke at @xmath19 gev were obtained down to @xmath59 gev / c@xmath51 , i.e.  very close to the kinematical limit at @xmath60 gev / c@xmath51 . at this limit",
    "no energy can be transfered which excites the target nucleus or knocks out target nucleons .",
    "the target nucleus must take part in the reaction as a whole such that the effective target mass is @xmath61 .",
    "there are only two particles , @xmath0-meson and nucleus , in the final state ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "2 .   within a phase - space treatment of the final state ,",
    "the steep rise ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) of the subthreshold data indicates that all 12 nucleons plus the @xmath65-hyperon carry away energy in the final state .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction with the above statement of @xmath62 .",
    "however , this might reflect that more and more nucleons in the _ initial state _ must take part in the kaon - production process when approaching the kinematical limit ( see discussion of the 1.0 gev data below ) .",
    "the different slope parameters @xmath46 below and above the free @xmath5 threshold ( @xmath6 gev ) indicate a change of the dominant @xmath0-production mechanism . this has been predicted by various model calculations @xcite and",
    "is confirmed by recent coincidence measurements with anke ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : mechanisms ] for details ) .",
    "the anke data for @xmath0 production at @xmath19  gev are plotted as invariant cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.0gev ] , see also ref .",
    "as discussed above the high - momentum part of the kaon spectrum ( smallest values of @xmath42 ) is most sensitive to collective nuclear effects .",
    "for example , if the kaons are produced in a collision of the beam proton with a single nucleon , internal momenta of at least @xmath66  mev / c are needed in order to produce kaons in the forward direction with momenta of @xmath67  mev / c .",
    "such high momentum components above @xmath68  mev / c are essentially due to many - body correlations in the nucleus .    to get a _",
    "rough estimate _ of the number of participating nucleons , one can describe the invariant cross section within a phase - space approximation .",

    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.0gev ] show the invariant cross section calculated with eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinem ] ) for @xmath72 .",
    "although this approach completely neglects the intrinsic motion of the @xmath71 target nucleons , it shows that kaon production at @xmath19  gev can only be understood in terms of cooperative effects , where the effective number of nucleons involved in the interaction is @xmath73 .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that such effects can be described in terms of multi - step mechanisms ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : mechanisms ] ) or high - momentum components in the nuclear wave function .",
    "the dependence of meson - production cross sections on the target mass @xmath74 has frequently been used ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) to obtain information about production mechanisms . at large beam energies ,",
    "@xmath0-mesons are supposed to be dominantly produced in a collision of the beam proton with a single target nucleon ( @xmath75 ) . in this case",
    "one expects that the cross section scales as @xmath76 .",
    "below threshold multi - step production , in particular two - step reactions with the creation of intermediate pions ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) , should dominate , and the cross sections are then proportional to @xmath79 @xcite .    figure [ fig : ratios ] shows the cross section ratios for au and c nuclei at @xmath19 gev and 2.3 gev .",
    "surprisingly , at both beam energies the momentum averaged cross - section ratios seem to be in line with @xmath80 .",
    "there is , at least , no increase of the average ratio towards the lower beam energy .",
    "the mass dependence of the 1.0  gev data from anke , selecting forward angles @xmath81 , is in strong contrast to the observed @xmath79 dependence ( @xmath82(au / c@xmath83 ) of the total cross sections at the same beam energy @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite interpreted the latter as an indication for multi - step processes .",
    "a qualitative explanation @xcite of this discrepancy can be obtained if one assumes that in the subthreshold domain the large angle @xmath0-production is due to reactions of the projectile protons with more than a single nucleon .",
    "the @xmath74 dependence of the anke data at small angles indicates direct production of @xmath0-mesons through the interaction of incident protons with surface nucleons .",
    "we have to conclude , however , that the @xmath74 dependence of the differential spectra does not reveal the expected change from direct to multi - step kaon production with decreasing beam energy .    according to model calculations ,",
    "the momentum distributions of protons and deuterons , measured in coincidence with the @xmath0-mesons , are sensitive to the different production mechanisms @xcite .",
    "a ( @xmath9)-pair in the final state can , for example , be observed in case of a particular two - step reaction with deuteron formation in the first step ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) @xcite , while @xmath8 pairs may come both from the two - step and direct production . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of deuteron break - up in the nucleus might be strong , so that one does not observe any coincident deuterons .",
    "first test measurements of @xmath8 and @xmath9 coincidences have been performed at @xmath86 and 2.3  gev .",
    "the amount of detected deuterons is rather large ( comparable to the @xmath8 yield ) at @xmath17 gev and decreases towards larger energies .",
    "this is in line with the interpretation that the contribution of two - step mechanisms is large at 1.2 gev and almost negligible at the highest energy .",
    "the momentum spectrum of the correlated deuterons at @xmath17 gev is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k+d ] .    a peak structure in the deuteron - momentum distribution is observed at @xmath87  mev / c , which is close to the expected value for on - shell two - body kinematics of the reaction @xmath88 with backward emission of the deuteron in the ( @xmath89 ) cms . in this collinear geometry ,",
    "pions with maximum momenta are produced which is energetically favorable for @xmath0-production in the second step .",
    "a similar peak structure has been predicted @xcite for the deuteron spectrum at @xmath19 gev and , thus , this spectrum can be considered as first direct experimental evidence of the two - step production below threshold .",
    "however , detailed model calculations still have to show whether the observed peak structure can not be faked by competing processes like coalescence @xcite or pick - up reactions .",
    "another source of @xmath9 pairs might be the kaon production on two- ( or multi- ) nucleon clusters @xcite which is expected to yield deuterons with similar momentum distributions as from the two - step mechanism .",
    "the ratios of kaon - production cross sections for cu / c , ag / c and au / c measured at 2.3 gev are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsi ] . all data exhibit similar shapes , rising steadily with decreasing kaon momenta , passing a maximum and falling steeply at low momenta .",
    "the position of the maximum varies with the nucleus , a fit to the data gives @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 mev / c for au , ag , and cu , respectively .",
    "the same effect at low @xmath23 has been observed for beam energies down to 1.5 gev , suggesting that the phenomenon is independent of the @xmath0-production mechanism and , thus , due to final - state interaction of the @xmath0 with the residual nucleus .",
    "the peak structure seems not to be visible in the ratio au / c at @xmath19 gev shown on the l.h.s .   of fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] . however , at this low beam energy the large background permitted us to extract the cross sections only down to @xmath93 mev / c , which is slightly below the peak positions observerd at @xmath94 gev . taking into account the large error bar of the lowest data point ,",
    "the apparent constant ratio at @xmath19 gev is not in contradiction with the strong decrease abserved at higher energies .",
    "[ fig : fsi ] shows that the position of the maximum in @xmath95/c ) increases with @xmath74 .",
    "the situation has a parallel in the well - known suppression of @xmath96 emission in heavy nuclei at low positron momenta , arising from the repulsive coulomb potential @xmath97 .",
    "positively charged particles , like @xmath0-mesons , produced at rest at some radius @xmath82 in the target nucleus , acquire a momentum @xmath98 , if other interactions are negligible .",
    "moreover , it is known from @xmath0 elastic scattering experiments at higher energies  @xcite that the nuclear @xmath99 potential is mildly repulsive , in agreement with one - body optical potentials based upon low - energy @xmath100 scattering parameters  @xcite . at normal nuclear density , @xmath101@xmath102 ,",
    "the predicted repulsive @xmath99 potential of strength @xmath103",
    "mev  @xcite would shift the kaon momenta to higher values .",
    "results of calculations in the framework of a coupled channel transport model  @xcite for @xmath82(au / c ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsi ] ( r.h.s . ) . without including the coulomb and nuclear kaon potentials ( dashed line ) the ratio exhibits a smooth momentum dependence with a steady increase towards low momenta as a result of the stronger @xmath0 rescattering processes for the au target .",
    "coulomb interaction leads to a distortion of the momentum spectrum and provides a maximum at @xmath104 mev / c ( dotted line ) . an additional change is observed in the calculations when a repulsive kaon nuclear potential is also considered . using a kaon potential of @xmath105 mev in the calculations , a reasonable agreement with the data",
    "is achieved , with a maximum close to the experimental value of @xmath106 mev / c ( solid line ) .",
    "we expect that after refined model calculations the nuclear @xmath0-potential at normal nuclear density @xmath107 can be determined with an accuracy of better than @xmath7  mev .",
    "this is significantly better than the current knowledge from heavy - ion collisions ( @xmath108 ) where the uncertainties are of the order of 15 mev @xcite .",
    "the anke experimental program on inclusive production of @xmath0-mesons in @xmath1 reactions has been finalized .",

    "[ sec : mechanisms ] .",
    "it is planned to continue these studies during the year 2003 .",
    "similar measurements have already been made with a hydrogen target at @xmath109 and 2.83 gev .",
    "first analyses of these data showed that anke allows to study the production of heavy hyperons , up to the @xmath65(1520 ) , in @xmath110 reactions @xcite .    in spring 2002 a detection system for negatively charged particles , in particular @xmath111-mesons , has been commissioned at anke .",
    "it will be used to study the production of @xmath112 pairs in @xmath58 @xcite , @xmath113 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite collisions . from the latter measurements one hopes to obtain information about the production and interaction of @xmath111-mesons in the nuclear medium .",
    "the nuclear potential of the @xmath111-mesons is supposed to be strongly attractive , in contrast to @xmath0-mesons where we found a repulsive potential , or mass shift , of @xmath103 mev .",
