    "the high  temperature superconductors ( htsc ) exhibit qualitative differences with respect to the classical superconducting systems .",
    "normal state properties of underdoped superconductors and the upward curvature of the upper critical field ( @xmath0 ) belong to one of the most spectacular examples .",
    "the presence of a normal  state pseudogap has been confirmed with the help of different experimental techniques like : angle  resolved photoemission @xcite , intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy @xcite , nmr @xcite , infrared @xcite and transport @xcite measurements . despite a wide spectrum of experimental data the underlying microscopic mechanism if far from being understood . a tempting hypothesis that the pseudogap is a precursor of the superconducting gap has not definitively been confirmed . in particular , the neutron scattering experiments @xcite reveal qualitative differences between the isotope effects observed for the superconductivity and the pseudogap .",
    "moreover , results obtained with the help of intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy @xcite speak against the superconducting origin of the pseudogap . the coexistence of superconductivity and the charge  density waves @xcite can be considered as a possible scenario , that accounts for differences between superconductivity and the normal  state gap .",
    "inhomogeneous distribution of holes which enter the copper - oxygen planes in the doping process can give rise to the formation of stripes .",
    "there is a convincing experimental and theoretical argumentation speaking in favor of the stripe ",
    "phase @xcite with an intimate connection between superconducting and stripe correlations .",
    "this phase consists of antiferromagnetic domains which are separated by the hole  rich domain walls .",
    "differences between the high  temperature superconductors and classical systems show also up in the magnetic properties .",
    "the high@xmath1 compounds are characterized by large values of the upper critical field and its unusual temperature dependence .",
    "the resistivity measurements clearly indicate an upward curvature of the upper critical field with no evidence of saturation even at genuinely low temperatures @xcite .",
    "these results remain in disagreement with the conventional , microscopic approach @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained as a result of the josephson tunneling between superconducting clusters @xcite produced by a macroscopic phase separation .",
    "due to the complexity of the gorkov equations one usually assumes that the normal  state properties of the system under consideration can properly be described by three @xcite or two  dimensional @xcite electron gas .",
    "recently , we have proposed an approach that enables calculation of the upper critical field for a two  dimensional lattice gas @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to derive @xmath0 in a similar way as one calculates the critical temperature in the standard bcs formalism .",
    "therefore , any extension of the analysis of the upper critical field is rather straightforward . in the present paper",
    "we calculate the upper critical field in a system that exhibits some important properties of hole  doped cuprates : stripe  phase and the presence of the pseudogap . in the latter case",
    "we discuss the coexistence of superconductivity and charge  density  wave as well as a phenomenological pseudogap .",
    "we show that the anomalous properties of the high  temperature superconductors are reflected in the upper critical field .",
    "we consider a two  dimensional square lattice immersed in a perpendicular uniform magnetic field of magnitude @xmath2 .",
    "we assume the nearest  neighbor pairing interaction , @xmath3 , that is responsible for anisotropic superconductivity and the interaction term , @xmath4 , which leads to the charge  density",
    "the relevant hamiltonian reads @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 here , @xmath7 annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath8 at the lattice site @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath11 is the bohr magneton .",
    "@xmath12 is the nearest ",
    "neighbor hopping integral that in the presence of the magnetic field acquires the peierls phase  factor @xcite @xmath13 in the mean - field approximation the pairing interaction and the cdw coupling take on the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the superconducting singlet order parameter and @xmath16 represents the magnitude of the cdw gap .",
    "the complexity of calculations strongly depends on the cdw modulation vector @xmath17 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider a commensurate charge  density wave with @xmath18 .",
    "this choice of the modulation vector results in the gap in the density of states that opens in the middle of the band ( in our case at the fermi level ) independently on the magnitude of the external magnetic field .",
    "since the pseudogap hardly depends on the magnitude of the magnetic field @xcite , @xmath16 will be taken as a model parameter .    in order to calculate the upper critical field",
    "we make use of the unitary transformation that diagonalizes the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xcite . in the case of the landau gauge , @xmath19 , this transformation is determined by a plane  wave function in @xmath20 direction and an eigenfunction of the harper equation @xcite : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is an integer number that enumerates the lattice sites in @xmath23 direction , whereas @xmath24 is the reduced magnetic field , @xmath25 , that is expressed by the ratio of the flux @xmath26 through the lattice cell and the flux quantum @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the wave  vector in @xmath20 direction and @xmath29 is an additional quantum number , that in the absence of the magnetic field is the wave  vector in @xmath23 direction . in the new basis",
    "the normal  state hamiltonian takes on the form : @xmath30 where @xmath31    one can prove that if @xmath32 represents the eigenvalue of the harper equation obtained for the wave ",
    "vector @xmath28 then @xmath33 is one of the eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath34 .",
    "it can also be shown that @xmath35 represents an eigenfunction of the harper equation calculated for momentum @xmath28 with the eigenvalue @xmath36 . with the help of these relations one can obtain analytically the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian in the normal state , @xmath37 , provided that the eigenvalues of the harper equation are known .",
    "in particular , one can calculate the anomalous green functions which are related to the superconducting order parameter : @xmath38 k_{\\bar{l}\\bar{k}p}(\\omega ) , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are determined by the solution of the harper equation @xmath41 due to the plane  wave behavior in @xmath20 direction the superconducting order parameter depends explicitly only on the position in @xmath23 direction ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) @xmath42 @xmath43 , when integrated over @xmath44 with the fermi function , gives the cooper pair susceptibility @xmath45 one can see that the impact of the charge ",
    "density waves on superconductivity is brought about only by the modification of this quantity .",
    "equations ( 10 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) allow one to calculate the upper critical field . it is determined as the highest magnitude of the magnetic field for which there exists a non  zero solution for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "figure 1 . shows the reduced upper critical field , @xmath48 , as a function of temperature calculated for different magnitudes of the cdw order parameter , @xmath16 .",
    "we have adjusted the magnitude of the pairing potential @xmath49 that gives the same superconducting transition temperature @xmath50 for all values of @xmath16 .",
    "these results have been obtained for @xmath51 cluster that at temperatures @xmath52 gives convergent results ( we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for details of the cluster calculations ) .",
    "one can see that even for small magnitudes of the cdw order parameter the upper critical field is significantly reduced . however , qualitative temperature dependence of @xmath0 is not affected by the charge  density wave correlations .",
    "the reduction of the upper critical field due to the charge  density waves may be brought about by a direct coupling between cdw and superconducting order parameters as well as by the modification of the density of states . in order to distinguish these contributions we investigate the upper critical field in the presence of a phenomenological normal  state gap of arbitrary magnitude and depth .",
    "this problem will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we investigate modification of the upper critical field that originates only from the normal  state gap in the density of states . in contradistinction to the analysis presented in the previous section , the density of states may remain finite despite the presence of the gap . here",
    ", the normal  state gap is characterized by the width @xmath53 and the relative depth @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the density of states in the presence and without the pseudogap , respectively .",
    "it is visualized in the inset in fig .",
    "2 . in the absence of the cdw order the upper critical field",
    "is determined by eq .",
    "( 10 ) with @xmath57 in order to account for the modification of the density of states we renormalize the normal  state propagators which give rise to the cooper - pair susceptibility @xmath58 \\nonumber . \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limiting case @xmath59 one obtains the standard density of states as determined by the hofstadter spectrum , whereas for @xmath60 the density of states vanishes in the vicinity of the fermi energy . substituting the renormalized propagators into eq .",
    "( 16 ) one can calculate the upper critical field in the same way as described in the previous section .",
    "figure 2 . shows the superconducting transition temperature obtained for different values of the reduced magnetic field with @xmath61 . as before ,",
    "the intersite coupling @xmath49 have been adjusted to obtain @xmath62 in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "one can see that the upper critical field is reduced due to the presence of the normal  state gap .",
    "the most significant lowering of @xmath0 takes place for finite values of the @xmath63 which are comparable to the magnitude of the superconducting gap .",
    "this result originates from the fact that the cooper pair susceptibility is strongly peaked at the fermi level with a characteristic energy scale that is determined by temperature .",
    "therefore , for @xmath64 the pseudogap results in a global lowering of the density of states which can be compensated by an enhancement of the pairing potential .",
    "it means that assuming stronger pairing potential @xmath49 we can reproduce @xmath65 calculated in the absence of the gap .",
    "we have found that the reduction of the upper critical field increases with the depth of the gap as depicted in fig .",
    "3 . the inset in fig . 3 shows a comparison of @xmath0 obtained for the phenomenological pseudogap with @xmath60 and for the charge  density waves .",
    "a comparison of these results clearly indicate that the coupling between cdw and superconducting order parameters results in a small decrement of the upper critical field .",
    "other unusual feature of htsc , that we discuss in the present section , is related to inhomogeneous distribution of holes .",
    "it results in a stripe  phase which consists of antiferromagnetic domains separated by hole  rich domain walls .",
    "we study how the upper critical field is affected by this specific distribution of carriers . in order to simulate the presence of a stripe  phase we carry out the calculations for a long and narrow rectangular ",
    "shape clusters .",
    "we assume that the isolating , antiferromagnetic domains can be simulated by fixed boundary conditions in the direction perpendicular to the stripes ( along the @xmath23 axis ) .",
    "the spatial organization of the stripe structure has been intensively investigated on experimental @xcite and theoretical grounds @xcite .",
    "experimental data for htsc show that the width of stripes depends on the concentration of holes and is of the order of a few lattice constants . the neutron ",
    "scattering study of the stripe phase @xcite suggests that the hole - rich domain walls are only single cell wide . on the other hand , the numerical study of the two ",
    "dimensional @xmath66@xmath67 model @xcite shows that the domain walls may have a significant density of holes over three rows of sites .",
    "according to these results we consider @xmath68 finite systems , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "our simplified approach does not restore the actual structure of the stripe  phase .",
    "in particular , for @xmath71 one obtains an unphysical , purely one  dimensional system , that hardly depends on the external magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we investigate the rectangular  shape clusters with the width as a free parameter . since we neglect the correlations between different stripes , the upper critical field is determined by eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 16 ) .    in the case of free electron gas external magnetic field",
    "leads to the occurrence of rotationally invariant states corresponding to the landau orbits .",
    "however , the geometry of the stripe  phase may seriously affect the formation of the landau orbits .",
    "this effect is of particular significance if the radii of the landau orbits , @xmath72 , exceed the width of the stripe , @xmath73 , ( @xmath74 is the lattice constant ) . in order to visualize the impact of magnetic field on electrons in the stripe ",
    "phase we have calculated the resulting current distribution . within the framework of the linear  response theory the current operator is given by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 denotes spatial coordinates and @xmath77 s are unit vectors in the lattice axes directions .",
    "results obtained in the normal state ( @xmath78 ) on a @xmath79 cluster with applied magnetic field @xmath80 are presented in figure 4 .",
    "modification of the landau orbits affects the diamagnetic pair  breaking mechanism .",
    "therefore , one may expect that superconductivity survives in the presence of much stronger magnetic fields than in the homogeneous phase .",
    "this observation is confirmed by the numerical calculations , as depicted in figure 5 .    here , @xmath81",
    "cluster corresponds to an infinite system .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath0 is of particular importance for weak magnetic fields , when @xmath82 .",
    "one can observe a dramatic change of the slope , @xmath83 , calculated at @xmath84 . here",
    ", the impact of the magnetic field on the superconducting transition temperature is much less than in the homogeneous two  dimensional case .",
    "the pseudogap and stripes affect the superconducting properties of the system both in the presence and in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "modification of the density of states changes the effective coupling constant , @xmath85 , that enters the standard bcs gap equation .",
    "therefore , we have directly compared the @xmath0 for systems , which in the absence of magnetic field are characterized by the same transition temperature ( one can roughly say that @xmath86 ) . in order to complete the discussion , we have also calculated the @xmath65 for the case when the pairing potential does not depend on the pseudogap and the stripe structure ( @xmath87 ) . since , the opening of the pseudogap reduces @xmath1 it results also in an additional decrement of the upper critical field , when compared to the results presented in figs .",
    "( 1 - 3 ) .",
    "however , an enhancement of the @xmath0 in the stripe phase can take place despite the reduction of the superconducting transition temperature , as depicted in the inset in fig .",
    "in order to clarify some physical aspects of our method one can compare it with approaches , which are commonly used to investigate @xmath0 .",
    "previously , we have applied the same method to discuss the upper critical field for isotropic superconductivity @xcite .",
    "then , one ends up with the gap equation that can be written in the form @xmath88 here , @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the one  electron green s function in the presence of a uniform and static magnetic field .",
    "it is clear that the above equation is a lattice version of the linearized gorkov equations @xcite , which determine the critical field at a second - order transition , where the superconducting gap @xmath91 is vanishing @xcite .",
    "however , our method does not allow to discuss the superconducting properties below the @xmath0 ( e.g. the vortex state ) . in our approach",
    "the electron green s functions have been calculated exactly , whereas in the standard case one makes use of the semiclassical approximation that neglects the landau level quantization .    to conclude ,",
    "we have investigated how the upper critical field is connected with different features of high  temperature superconductors .",
    "in particular , we have discussed @xmath0 in the presence of charge ",
    "density waves , phenomenological pseudogap and stripes .",
    "our results suggest that a gap in the density of states reduces the upper critical field , independently on the underlying microscopic mechanism . for finite density of states at the fermi level this reduction",
    "is mostly pronounced when the width of the gap is of the order of the superconducting transition temperature . in the phase with isotropic cdw gap the density of states at the fermi level vanishes .",
    "then , as one can expect , the upper critical field is strongly reduced even by a relatively small gap . here , the coupling between the cdw and superconducting order parameters results in an additional reduction of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , in the presence of stripes the upper critical field is enhanced , especially close to @xmath1 .",
    "we attribute this effect to the reduction of the orbital pair  breaking mechanism since the radii of the landau orbits are much larger than the width of the stripes .",
    "the presented investigation of @xmath0 is restricted to the simplest case of the uniform magnetic field and neglects a possible disorder in the vortex system .",
    "it can originate from fluctuations close to the phase transition or inhomogeneous charge and spin distribution in the stripe  phase .",
    "however , as we are concerned exclusively with the critical field at the second  order transition , these effects are of minor importance .",
    "we have also not discussed the reentrance of superconductivity in the strong  magnetic field .",
    "this effect has been investigated in the continuum model @xcite as well as in the case of lattice gas @xcite , when the structure of fractal energy spectrum is reflected in phase diagram .",
    "theoretical argumentation that supports the reentrance of superconductivity remains valid also in the presence of pseudogap , at least on the simplest level that has been used in the present paper .",
    "however , in the genuinely strong magnetic field the assumption of the field ",
    "independent gap is unphysical and microscopic investigation of this phenomenon is needed .",
