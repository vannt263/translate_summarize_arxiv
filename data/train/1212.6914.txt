    "molecular magnets make a wide emerging class of new materials whose properties extend the range of those typically associated with magnets , i.e. they offer low density , transparency , electrical insulation , and a possibility of low - temperature synthesis @xcite .",
    "single - chain magnets ( scm ) belonging to the class of molecular magnets , have been of particular interest since gatteschi et al .",
    "@xcite discovered slow relaxation of magnetization in a chain compound , comprising co(ii ) centers and organic radicals , without any evidence of phase transition to a three - dimensional magnetic ordering .",
    "soon after , clerac et al . discovered similar magnetic properties in an @xmath7 heisenberg ferromagnetic chain comprising mn(iii)-ni(ii)-mn(iii ) trimers with an easy axis parallel to the chain @xcite .",
    "next , other scm systems often based on ferrimagnetic chains containing alternating spins of unequal magnitude were discovered @xcite .",
    "the slow magnetic relaxation arises from large uniaxial magnetic anisotropy , negligible magnetic interactions between the chains and considerable intrachain interactions @xcite .",
    "the last condition is desirable for raising the blocking temperature .",
    "moreover , for some one - dimensional quantum spin systems with competing nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite the single - chain magnetic behavior can be affected with frustration @xcite .",
    "the simplest description of ferromagnetic scms is based on the glauber theory if the limit of an ising chain can be explored @xcite .",
    "the ising ferromagnetic chains display slow relaxation of magnetization and the relaxation time @xmath8 depends on the spin - pair correlations .",
    "for these chains the correlation length @xmath9 diverges exponentially at low temperatures as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the correlation energy and @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath11 is proportional to the activation energy which enters the arrhenius law @xcite and can be directly estimated from the experimental static susceptibility of the chain by the relation @xmath13 , plotting ln(@xmath14 ) as a function of 1/@xmath15 .",
    "the correlation energy is also referred to as the energy to create a domain wall .",
    "important fact is that @xmath11 is proportional to the magnetic coupling constant @xcite and similar conclusions remain valid for the antiferromagnetic ising model @xcite but then @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , the correlation energy @xmath11 is also the main part of the additive term determining the relaxation time in the ising - like and anisotropic classical heisenberg chains @xcite .    the relations between the correlation length and the zero - field susceptibility as well as between the correlation energy and the magnetic coupling can be used for the classical ferromagnetic heisenberg model in the strong anisotropy limit @xcite . if the hamiltonian is defined by @xmath17 the limit",
    "is reached when the exchange coupling @xmath18 and the single - ion anisotropy @xmath19 satisfy the relation @xmath20 .",
    "then the correlation energy calculated from the product @xmath14 yields the value of the coupling @xmath18 because @xcite @xmath21    for ferromagnetic systems , this scenario is well confirmed @xcite and has been exploited for a number of compounds @xcite , but for antiferromagnetic chains with non - collinear anisotropy axes @xcite the situation is much less clear .",
    "the problem was revealed @xcite for the compound of formula [ mn(tpp)o@xmath22phph]@xmath23h@xmath22o considered a textbook example of scm ( tpp = _ meso_-tetraphenylporphyrin and phph = phenylphosphinate ) and referred to as mn - caf ( canted antiferromagnet ) .",
    "it was possible to rationalise many experimental results performed on mn - caf , assuming the generalised expression for the correlation energy in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the canting angle for two classical spins oriented along the anisotropy axes .",
    "however , the proportionality between the correlation length @xmath9 and the product @xmath14 was ruled out , implying that the correlation energy can not be determined by the magnetic measurement of the static susceptibility .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the correlation energy of the quantum model of a canted antiferromagnetic chain can be found from the in - field single - crystal magnetization profile properly chosen and its @xmath25 dependence is given by the classical expression ( [ eq : deltaksi ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that the correlation energy @xmath11 can be estimated from the in - field magnetization measurements .",
    "as soon as the spin value , the geometrical structure and @xmath11 are known , the value @xmath18 of the magnetic coupling follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltaksi ] ) . considering the empirical shape of the magnetization isotherm in the @xmath4 direction for mn - caf",
    ", we directly find the @xmath18 value without any fitting procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] is devoted to a model describing the anisotropic quantum spin systems and the numerical method for accurate calculations of magnetic properties in a wide temperature range .",
    "[ sec:2 ] is dedicated to presentation of results and their discussion .",
    "[ sec:3 ] concludes our paper , summarizing the main outcomes .",
    "we consider the quantum anisotropic heisenberg model which is needed to get quantitative estimates of the thermodynamic properties @xcite of the chains with non - collinear anisotropy axes @xmath26 where spin @xmath27 and @xmath28 stands for the length of the chain .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath18 between nearest - neighbor spins is isotropic , uniform and positive .",
    "the tensors representing the single - ion anisotropy @xmath29 and @xmath30-factors are non - diagonal and depend on angles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) or ( @xmath31 , @xmath2 ) for odd and even sites , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath32 define the global coordination system .",
    "the @xmath4 direction is chosen along the chain axis and plays also the role of the quantization axis .    , where the spherical angles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) are defined .",
    "the black arrows represent the canted mn - caf spin arrangement , whereas the gray ones correspond to the collinear antiferomagnetic spin arrangement ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) . ]",
    "the explicit form of the tensors in the model ( [ eq:01 ] ) depends on the angles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) defining the anisotropy axes ( fig .",
    "[ fig:00 ] ) and is given in the previous publications @xcite .",
    "we note that for all the pairs of angles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) the canting angle is determined from the relation @xmath35    analysis of our model ( [ eq:01 ] ) is based on the numerical quantum transfer matrix method @xcite , where the partition function of the quantum chain is mapped onto the partition function of the classical @xmath36 system with multi - spin interactions and a finite width @xmath37 @xcite . for different values of @xmath38 , called the trotter number , the classical partition functions form a series of approximants @xmath39 , where the leading errors are of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath38 , the better the quantum nature of the problem is taken into account . as the hilbert space dimension increases exponentially with increasing trotter number ,",
    "computations are feasible only for relatively small @xmath38 . to overcome this problem",
    ", we employ the density - matrix renormalization group technique ( dmrg ) @xcite for determining an effective hamiltonian representation in the hilbert subspace of a given size @xmath41 which ensures covering the entire experimental temperature range .",
    "the dmrg method is very powerful but it is computationally demanding as far as the resources and programming are concerned .",
    "the transfer matrices are asymmetric and the corresponding density matrices , constructed from the right and left eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalue @xmath42 of a transfer matrix , are non - hermitian .",
    "we were able to overcome these problems by applying complex algebra @xcite , which guaranties the biorthogonality of complex eigenvectors but increases the computational complexity .    in some dmrg applications @xcite the hilbert space",
    "is split into subspaces of fixed values of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes a spin variable in a given column .",
    "then the highest eigenvalue @xmath42 can be found in the block with the staggered magnetization @xmath45 .",
    "this simplification follows from some symmetries which may occur in the four - spin dmrg vertices . for the non - collinear model",
    "this is not the case , therefore @xmath42 has to be found in the entire hilbert space .    for each temperature",
    ", the free energy of the macroscopic system ( [ eq:01 ] ) per site ( @xmath46 ) is related to the maximum eigenvalue @xmath42 of the transfer matrix @xmath47 @xcite , whereas the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility can be obtained by taking the first and second derivatives of the free energy with respect to external magnetic field .",
    "these quantities are calculated in the subspace @xmath48 and @xmath49 which follows from the hamiltonian symmetry .",
    "the correlation length of the @xmath50 components of spin is given by the following ratio @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the tensor product of the @xmath53-component of the spin operator and @xmath54 identity matrices of @xmath55 size .",
    "the @xmath56 vector corresponds to the @xmath42 eigenvalue , whereas the eigenvalue @xmath57 is the highest among all whose eigenvector @xmath58 which satisfy the condition @xmath59 .",
    "the convergence of the approximants with respect to @xmath38 depends on temperature and the size of the optimal basis set @xmath41 .",
    "our results are provided for @xmath60 and the trotter number @xmath38 up to @xmath61 ( the lower temperature the higher @xmath38 is needed ) . according to our estimation",
    "the accuracy of results in the whole parameter space considered is not lower than 0.5% @xcite .",
    "recently several compounds of antiferromagnetic one - dimensional systems containing mn(iii ) ions have been reported @xcite . here",
    "the most interesting example @xcite is mn - caf , where the anisotropy axes are defined by jahn - teller elongation of mn(iii ) octahedra and make the angle @xmath62 deg with the chain direction parallel to the @xmath4 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:00 ] ) .",
    "projections of the anisotropy axes onto the plane perpendicular to the chain , alternate along the @xmath63 crystallographic axis making angles @xmath64 deg .",
    "the single - crystal magnetometry measurements @xcite revealed three patterns of the in - field - magnetization profiles . for the @xmath63 direction",
    "the pattern shows linear field dependence and is referred to as antiferromagnetic ( af ) .",
    "the field dependencies measured along the @xmath65 and @xmath4 are referred to as the weak ferromagnetic ( wf ) and the metamagnetic type ( mm ) , respectively .",
    "taking into account the known values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 angles and performing the monte carlo simulations , the values of exchange coupling , uniaxial anisotropy and @xmath66-factor were obtained ( in short the mn - caf parameters ) for the classical counterpart of the model ( [ eq:01 ] ) , @xmath67 fitting the experimental susceptibility and magnetization curves @xcite .",
    "so , the high value of the ratio @xmath68 corresponding to a strong anisotropy occurred .    using the classical mn - caf parameters ( [ eq:00 ] ) and the corresponding angles @xmath69 we have determined the in - field magnetization profiles for three crystallographic directions .",
    "their features agree qualitatively with those published previously in fig .  5 for mn - caf @xcite , including the sequence of patterns af , wf and mm for the @xmath63 , @xmath65 , @xmath4 directions .",

    "the field dependence of the correlation energy @xmath76 has been studied numerically and plotted by triangles in the bottom part of fig  ( [ fig:04 ] ) .",
    "we have revealed the striking linear behavior which can be very well reproduced by the function @xmath85 where the right hand side is expressed in k and the field is given in t. so , the function @xmath76 vanishes , which implies a finite value of correlation length @xmath9 ( see eq .",

    "we demonstrate in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:04 ] that the @xmath70-type profile displays a rapid jump in the vicinity of @xmath3  t from @xmath88 to a nearly saturation value .",
    "we interpret this behavior as a field - driven transition from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic order along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "such critical field can be determined from the intersection of the low - temperature magnetization isotherms , from their inflection point or from the maximum of the in - field magnetic susceptibility .",

    "the ratios @xmath95 calculated coincide with the values of the function s@xmath98 drawn by the dashed line and are lower by a factor of 2 than the ratios @xmath94 , implying that @xmath101 we can interpret the result ( [ eq : mh ] ) that the correlation energy is equal to the average zeeman energy per pair of spins calculated for the critical field @xmath3 .    the relation ( [ eq : mh ] ) is an important result of our paper because it provides a direct estimate of the correlation energy @xmath11 in terms of the special coordinates of the @xmath70-type magnetization profile .",

    "we have estimated for the mn - caf compound the relevant quantities at @xmath121 k and @xmath124 k which agree very well with the values reported earlier .",
    "our calculations provide some insight into the common claim that in the strong anisotropy limit the heisenberg model can be substituted by the ising model .",
    "we confirm that the projections of spins onto the axis displaying the @xmath70-type pattern can be treated as classical ising - type variables .",
    "then the rapid jump in the magnetization profile can be related to formation of an ising domain wall .",

    "<S> we demonstrate numerically that for the strongly anisotropic homometallic @xmath0 canted single - chain magnet described by the quantum antiferromagnetic heisenberg model the correlation energy and exchange coupling constant can be directly estimated from the in - field - magnetization profile found along the properly selected crystallographic direction . in the parameter space defined by the spherical angles ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) determining the axes orientation , </S>",
    "<S> four regions are identified with different sequences of the characteristic field - dependent magnetization profiles representing the antiferromagnetic , metamagnetic and weak ferromagnetic type behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these sequences provide a criterion for the applicability of the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model to a given experimental system . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the correlation energy decreases linearly with field and vanishes for a given value @xmath3 which defines a special coordinates in the metamagnetic profile relevant for the zero - field correlation energy and magnetic coupling . for the single - chain magnet formed by the strongly anisotropic manganese(iii ) acetate meso - tetraphenylporphyrin complexes coupled to the phenylphosphinate ligands , the experimental metamagnetic - type magnetization curve in the @xmath4 direction yields an accurate estimate of the values of correlation energy @xmath5  k and exchange coupling @xmath6  k. </S>"
