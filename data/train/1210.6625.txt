    "more precisely , we have @xmath109 for all @xmath110 .",
    "we would like to allow for the possibility of orthonormal vectors in @xmath108 .",
    "as the channel is unital this can only occur if @xmath111 , and hence we shall focus on this case here .    using the bloch sphere representation",

    "this is easily seen to occur precisely when @xmath129 in equation ( [ eq : channeldecomp ] ) has non - trivial nullspace .",

    "2 .   if the nullspace of @xmath129 is 2-dimensional , then the set @xmath108 is the set of all trace vectors of the subalgebra @xmath139 of @xmath143 diagonal matrices up to a unitary equivalence .",
    "if the nullspace of @xmath129 is 3-dimensional , then @xmath24 is the completely depolarizing channel and @xmath108 is the set of all unit vectors . in other words",
    ", @xmath108 is the set of all trace vectors of @xmath144 .",
    "we shall write @xmath145 for the bloch sphere vector representation of a single qubit state @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear from equation  ( [ eq : channeldecomp ] ) that @xmath146 if and only if @xmath147 . hence the relevant set that yields private states here is the intersection of the nullspace of @xmath129 and the surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "case ( 1 ) : the nullspace of @xmath129 is 1-dimensional . in this case , the nullspace is a single line through the origin of the bloch sphere and the range of @xmath129 is a plane through the origin . obviously this line meets the surface of the bloch sphere in two antipodal points .",
    "these two antipodal points correspond to a pair of orthonormal single qubit states .",
    "figure  1 gives an example .",
    "case ( 2 ) : the nullspace of @xmath129 is 2-dimensional . in this case , the nullspace is a plane through the origin of the bloch sphere .",
    "this plane meets the surface of the sphere in a great circle .",
    "the pure states corresponding to the points on this circle are precisely the private states for the channel .",
    "see an illustration in figure  2 .    to see how these private states arise from the trace vector perspective ,",
    "let us consider the action of the channel more directly .",
    "as the nullspace of @xmath129 is 2-dimensional , its range is a line through the origin . for simplicity we shall assume this line is the @xmath148-axis ; other cases are unitarily equivalent to this case .",
    "thus , the range of @xmath129 intersects the sphere in the north and south poles , corresponding to the pure states @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively .",
    "the action of @xmath129 here will be a possible rotation of the bloch sphere followed by a projection of the sphere onto the @xmath148-axis , followed by a possible contraction . by unitary equivalence , we only need consider the case where there is no initial rotation of the bloch sphere . in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath151",
    ", this means the action of the channel is given by @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 for some @xmath37 .",
    "now @xmath102 is the algebra of all diagonal matrices with respect to the ordered basis @xmath155 ; explicitly , @xmath102 is the set of all operators of the form @xmath156 for arbitrary scalars @xmath157 .",
    "then the projection onto the @xmath148-axis is a conditional expectation onto the subalgebra @xmath102 ; call it @xmath158 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath159 one can check directly that @xmath160 , where @xmath39 is the completely depolarizing channel .    as @xmath39 adds no restrictions to the private states for @xmath24",
    ", it suffices to show that the trace vectors for @xmath102 are precisely the pure states that lie on the equator of the bloch sphere .",
    "but the equator states are precisely the states that satisfy @xmath161 . and",
    "it is easy to see that these are the states which do indeed satisfy the trace vector condition for the algebra @xmath102 .",
    "case ( 3 ) : the nullspace of @xmath129 is 3-dimensional , in other words @xmath129 is the zero operator . in this case @xmath129 maps the entire bloch sphere to its origin , which corresponds to the maximally mixed state @xmath162 , as shown in figure  3 .",
    "it is clear in this case that @xmath24 is the completely depolarizing channel @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the set @xmath108 has no restrictions ; that is , @xmath108 is the set of all unit vectors . in other words , @xmath108 is the set of all trace vectors of @xmath144 .",
    "the following result clarifies the general connection between conditional expectation channels , trace vectors and private states .",
    "[ thm : pqcifftvs ] let @xmath163 be a conditional expectation channel .",

    "then @xmath165 for all @xmath166 , and in particular note that @xmath30 belongs to @xmath41 .",
    "thus for all @xmath110 and for all @xmath167 , we have @xmath168 where the second and third identities follow from the trace preservation and conditional expectation properties of @xmath24 respectively .",
    "it follows that the states of @xmath108 are trace vectors of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath30 .    for the converse ,",
    "observe that when the vector states of @xmath108 are trace vectors of @xmath41 with respect to @xmath30 , a similar calculation shows for all @xmath169 and for all @xmath54 that @xmath170 as @xmath30 belongs to @xmath41 , it follows that @xmath31 $ ] forms a private quantum channel .    of course the three cases of theorem  [ thm : n(t ) ] when applied to a unital single qubit conditional expectation channel @xmath171 are covered by this theorem . indeed ,",
    "applying theorem [ thm : pqcifftvs ] to @xmath172 and letting @xmath173 yields @xmath174 $ ] is a pqc if and only if @xmath175 or @xmath176 and @xmath108 is a set of trace vectors of @xmath41 .",
    "case 1 of theorem [ thm : n(t ) ] is an example of when @xmath108 is a proper subset of the set of all trace vectors of @xmath177 , whereas case 2 occurs when @xmath108 is the entire set .",
    "case 3 occurs when @xmath108 is the set of all trace vectors of @xmath138 .",
    "conditional expectations arise as the most basic non - trivial examples of private quantum communication using a private shared cartesian frame @xcite .",
    "let @xmath178 , and for simplicity suppose @xmath179 is even .",
    "decompose the space as @xmath180 where the special unitary group @xmath181 acts irreducibly on @xmath182 and trivially on @xmath183 . as formulated in @xcite ,",
    "if alice and bob share a reference frame to which eve does not have access , and alice prepares @xmath179 qubits in a state @xmath15 and sends them to bob , eve will see the resulting state simply as a mixture of all rotations @xmath184 .",
    "this situation can be summed up with the channel @xmath24 , defined by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the completely depolarizing channel on @xmath182 and @xmath187 is the projection onto @xmath182 .",
    "one can see immediately that @xmath24 is in fact a conditional expectation channel that maps onto the algebra @xmath188 .",
    "thus , as noted in theorem  [ thm : pqcifftvs ] , private states for @xmath24 can be found using trace vectors , which in this case can be constructed on the summands of the direct sum in a manner analogous to example  [ maxentangle ] .",
    "we see two main potential outcomes of the present work .",
    "firstly , it is clear even just from the examples we have discussed here that there are numerous conditional expectation channels of relevance in quantum information , though they have not been viewed from this perspective before . it should be possible to use the conditional expectation and trace vector machinery to construct other new and useful examples of private quantum channels",
    "secondly , this work raises the intriguing possibility that a much more extensive theory of private quantum channels and private states could be developed . with few exceptions ,",
    "the work on private channels appearing in the literature has focused primarily on specific instances and channels , rather than an overarching theory .",
