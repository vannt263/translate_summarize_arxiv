    "discrete counterpart of the kp equation , known in the name of discrete kp equation or hirota bilinear difference equation ( hbde)@xcite@xcite@xcite , plays a central role in the study of integrable nonlinear systems .",
    "it embodies infinite number of integrable differential equations .",
    "it is satisfied by string correlation function in particle physics@xcite , and is also satisfied by transfer matrices of some solvable lattice model @xcite .",
    "the equation possesses auto - bcklund transformation which acts on the solutions to the discrete kp equation and turns n - soliton solution to n+1-soliton solution @xcite .",
    "this transformation is generated by a pair of linear equations.i call the equations linear bcklund transformation equation ( lbte ) in this paper",
    ". they also play the important role in the study of integrable systems .",
    "they are lax pair of the discrete kp equation .",
    "they generate bethe ansatz solution of some solvable lattice model .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , from the structure of the discrete kp equation , dependent variables of discrete kp equation are considered to reside on face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice . indeed",
    ", the discrete kp equation does not change its form under the rotation of the fcc lattice . however , lbte to the discrete kp equation changes those form under the rotation .    in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the lbte are extended to possess the lattice symmetry , which i call the symmetric lbte in this paper and the following results are obtained .",
    "the extended equations were arranged in the form of + matrix @xmath2 vector@xmath3 + by considering the lattice symmetry .",
    "the condition that the extended equations have nontrivial solutions , i.e. vanishment of the determinant of the matrix , is just the discrete kp equation .",
    "furthermore the extended equations were generalized to higher dimension due to the lattice symmetry itself .",
    "on the one hand , comparing with the kp hierarchy which possesses @xmath4 type lie group symmetry acting on the space of solutions @xcite , there are integrable hierarchies which possess the @xmath5 or @xmath6 lie group symmetry behind them @xcite @xcite .",
    "such hierarchies are known in the name of bkp , fermionic bkp and dkp hierarchy . to these hierarchies",
    ", one can find discrete equations corresponding to the discrete kp equation by considering the infinite dimensional symmetry behind them . what would happen , when one corresponds proper lattices to the discrete equations , and consider the lattice symmetry of lbte s to these discrete equations ?    in this paper ,",

    "first , proper lattices are determined by comparing the type of the infinite dimensional symmetries and the dimension of the discrete equations .",
    "the discrete equations are invariant under the rotation of the lattices .",
    "second , the lbte to the discrete equation which possesses the lattice symmetry are constructed .",
    "the lbte can be represented by the functions on the vertices of some regular polyhedrons in the lattice .",
    "third , just the discrete equation is derived from the consistency condition for lbte , when one considers following two types of consistency condition .",
    "one condition is determinant type consistency condition explained above and another one is condition similar to the compatibility condition for lax pair , which is called compativility type condition in this paper . in some cases",
    ", lbte can not be arranged in the form of matrix @xmath2 vector=0 , however , in such cases , compatibility type condition becomes just the discrete equation .",
    "furthermore , by considering these two types of conditions , one can check that the lbte generates auto - bcklund transformation for the discrete equation .    after explaining main idea in the case of the kp hierarchy in section 2 ,",
    "i show the above results in the case of the bkp , fermionic bkp and dkp hierarchy in section 3 and 4 .",
    "( 120,45 ) ( -5,0 )    @xmath4 symmetry of space of solutions to the kp hierarchy allows one to deal it in simple form @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to summarize some results obtained in the previous paper @xcite , concerning to the discrete formula for the kp hierarchy and its lbte .",
    "lowest dimensional discrete formula belonging to the kp hierarchy , known in the name of discrete kp equation , is a 3 dimensional equation @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "( see also appendix ) the equation is most fundamental equation among discrete formulae for the kp hierarchy , in the sense that higher dimensional discrete formulae can be decomposed to it .",
    "discrete kp equation is the following . : z_12z_34f(k_1 + 1,k_2 + 1,k_3,k_4)f(k_1,k_2,k_3 + 1,k_4 + 1)-z_13z_24f(k_1 + 1,k_2,k_3 + 1,k_4)f(k_1,k_2 + 1,k_3,k_4 + 1)+z_14z_23f(k_1 + 1,k_2,k_3,k_4 + 1)f(k_1,k_2 + 1,k_3 + 1,k_4 ) = 0 [ eqn : dkp ] : here , @xmath7 is : z_ij = z_i - z_j : and @xmath8 are arbitrary complex constants .",
    "the equation seems defined on 4 dimensional lattice space .",
    "however , since the sum of the four variables does not vary in the equation , the equation is actually three dimensional equation .",
    "indeed , the following variable transformation allows one to represent the equation by three variables , : p = k_1,q = k_2,r = k_3,n = k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4 [ eqn : vari ] : .",
    "first , i seek the proper lattice for the discrete kp equation . to find it , i relate a regular polyhedron to the discrete kp equation , and join the polyhedrons .",
    "the proper polyhedron is considered to be octahedron , because the equation connects f s on six points .",
    "in fact , when one considers the four variables to be orthogonal , the equation takes the form of a summation of the products of f on one vertex of octahedron and another f on opposite side vertex . by joining octahedrons ,",
    "a fcc lattice is constructed .",
    "thus , proper lattice for the discrete kp equation turns out to be fcc lattice .",
    "it is known that there exist equations which generate bcklund transformation @xcite@xcite . in the previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the equations are extended to possess the lattice symmetry of fcc lattice .",
    "each of the equations takes same form with discrete formula of modified kp hierarchy @xcite.(see appendix ) the equations take the following form . : _",
    "j , k , l=1 ^ 4_ijklz_klf_kl g_j=0 , i=1,2,3,4 : where , @xmath9 is the levi - chivita tensor and small indices on f and g mean to increase the variable corresponding to index by one .",
    "for example , : g_1=g(k_1 + 1,k_2,k_3,k_4 ) f_12=f(k_1 + 1,k_2 + 1,k_3,k_4 ) f_11=f(k_1 + 2,k_2,k_3,k_4 ) : i called these equations symmetric lbte , in the previous paper .",
    "the symmetric lbte can be related to fundamental regular polyhedrons in fcc lattice , when one arranges these equations suitably .",
    "fundamental regular polyhedrons in fcc lattice are octahedron and two tetrahedrons .",
    "there are two such arrangements .",
    "one of which is as follows . : (    cccc 0&z_34f_34&-z_24f_24&z_23f_23 + -z_34f_34&0&z_14f_14&-z_13f_13 + z_24f_23&-z_14f_14&0&z_12f_12 + -z_23f_23&z_13f_13&-z_12f_12&0 +    ) (    cccc g_1 + g_2 + g_3 + g_4    ) = 0 [ eqn : kplb ] : another arrangement is to construct the elements of matrix and vector with g and f. in both of the arrangements , f and g in the matrix elements are on vertices of an octahedron .",
    "on the other hand , each g and f in the vector elements are on vertices of a tetrahedron dual to each other .",
    "note that the arrangements make the lattice symmetry of the equations manifest .    here is a further remark .",
    "fcc lattice is a root lattice of @xmath10 type lie group , and two tetrahedrons and one octahedron is weight diagrams of three fundamental representations of @xmath10 type lie group .",
    "this implies that one can determine the regular polyhedrons and proper lattice for the discrete formula , by comparing the dimension of the equation and symmetric groups corresponding to the hierarchy .",
    "in what follows , i show that symmetric lbte generate bcklund transformation successfully . here , `` successfully '' means the following : whenever f satisfies the discrete kp equation , the symmetric lbte can be solved for g , and the solution solves the discrete kp equation automatically .",
    "first , both f and g in the symmetric lbte satisfy discrete kp equation when they satisfy symmetric lbte . to show it",
    ", we consider equation @xmath11 as 4 linear equations to be solved for four g s .",
    "this four linear equations can be solved only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix vanishes . in this case",
    ", one can use the fact that determinant of antisymmetric matrix is a square of pfaffian .",
    "this fact leads the condition into the following compact form . :",
    "det(a_ij)=(pfaff(a_ij))^2=(z_12z_34f_12f_34 -z_13z_24f_13f_24 + z_14z_23f_14f_23)^2 = 0 : this is nothing but the discrete kp equation .",
    "now , one can exchange the role of f and g , by translating each equation in ( @xmath12 ) , so that g also satisfies the discrete kp equation .",
    "remark , that this explanation depends essencially on the arrangement of the symmetric lbte .",
    "second , symmetric lbte can be solved for g whenever f satisfies the discrete kp equation .",
    "this fact and first statement show that symmetric lbte generate bcklund transformation successfully .",
    "however , it requires little more consideration .",
    "in fact , other consistency condition than determinant type consistency condition arises as follows .",
    "consider the determinant type consistency condition is already satisfied .",
    "then , since the rank of the coefficient matrix is 2 , two equations out of four equations in @xmath11 remain independent .",
    "i chose such two equations as first two equations in ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for simplicity , i express the equations by the variables @xmath13 in ( @xmath14 ) . : 1 : : z_34f_rg_q - z_24f_qg_r+z_23f_qrg=02 : : -z_14f_pg_r+z_13f_prg+z_34f_rg_p=0 [ eqn : ink ] : these two equations provide several ways to obtain g on one point from g on other points .",
    "the value of obtained g needs to be independent on the choice of the ways . for example , in figure 1 , one can require the value of g(h ) from g(a ) , g(b ) , g(c ) , according to following two procedures .",
    ": 1 g(a),g(b ) g(f)g(b),g(c ) g(g ) g(f),g(g)g(h)2 g(a),g(b ) g(d)g(b),g(c ) g(f ) g(d),g(f ) g(h ) : one can evaluate the value of g on one point from the values of g on two points by using the equation corresponding to the number over the arrow ( @xmath15).here , arrow represents that process . after some calculation ,",
    "two procedures lead the following expressions of g(h ) . : 1 : : g(h)=g(a ) + g(c ) + g(b ) ( + ) 2 : : g(h)=g(a ) + g(c ) + g(b ) ( + ) [ eqn : two ] : these two g(h ) s need to coincide . by equating the coefficients of @xmath16",
    ", one can express the condition as follows . :",
    "( e^_r-1)()=0 : here , @xmath17 acts on arbitrary functions from leftside and increases the variable corresponding to index @xmath18 by one in the function . in the equation",
    "@xmath19 expresses the right hand side of equation ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath21 automatically coincide .",
    "thus , in this case , the condition is satisfied if f satisfies the discrete kp equation .",
    "however , this compatibility condition guaranties the existence of solution of g to symmetric lbte . to show it , i first put initial value of g on the plane p+q = c .",
    "here c is arbitrary constant . using the two equations in @xmath22 independently , one can obtain g s on the plane p+q = c+1 . to make the value of g on the plane p+q = c+1 unique , i impose the following condition on initial value of g. : = [ eqn : jyouken ] : if the compatibility condition is satisfied , this condition is also satisfied by g s on the plane p+q = c+1",
    ". therefore one can inductively construct g s on all lattice point , if the compatibility condition is satisfied .",
    "this concludes that there exist at least one solution of g for symmetric lbte with f being a solution to the discrete kp equation .",
    "( 50,50 ) ( -5,0 )    lowest dimension discrete formulae belonging to the bkp and the fermionic bkp hierarchy are known to be as follows @xcite@xcite@xcite .",

    ", @xmath25 are arbitrary complex constants .",
    "the equation is called discrete bkp equation , for the first choice of coefficient in ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "however i call the equation discrete bkp equation for both cases , neglecting the difference of the coefficients .    by considering the modified bkp hierarchy and the modified fermionic bkp hierarchy @xcite @xcite",
    ", one can obtain lbte for the equations .",
    "collecting the discrete formulae which depend on variables appearing in the discrete bkp equation , in the modified bkp hierarchy , the following three equations can be obtained.(see appendix ) : a_ij ( f_jg_i - f_ig_j)= b_ij ( f g_ij - f_ijg ) i , j=1,2,3 ij :    the discrete bkp equation is a three dimensional equation and connect f s on eight points .",
    "thus the cube may become proper regular polyhedron for discrete bkp equation .",
    "indeed , when the three variables p , q , r are considered to be orthogonal , the equation takes the form of summation of products of f on one vertex of the cube and another f on opposite side vertex .",
    "what is obtained by joining cubes is a simple cubic lattice .",
    "therefore i argue that the simple cubic lattice is the proper lattice for the discrete bkp equation .",
    "note that a cube and simple cubic lattice are obtained as weight diagram of a fundamental representation and root lattice for @xmath27-type lie group , respectively .",
    "on the other hand each of the equations in lbte connects f s and g s on a square .",
    "it does not change its form under the exchange of f and g.    as in the case of the discrete kp equation , discrete bkp equation appears as consistency condition for the lbte , by arranging the lbte in symmetric form . in simple cubic lattice ,",
    "fundamental regular polyhedron is a cube .",
    "thus such symmetric equations may connect f and g on a cube .",
    "indeed , by collecting equations in lbte corresponding to 6 squares of a cube , one can make such equations .",
    "these equations do not take the form of matrix times vector .",
    "thus determinant type consistency condition does not arise in this case .",
    "however compatibility condition may arise because one cube contains two parallel squares . indeed , there are three ways to obtain @xmath28 from @xmath29 by using the equations . : 1 : : g , g_1,g_2 g_12 : g , g_2,g_3 g_23 g_2,g_12,g_23 g_1232 : : g , g_2,g_3 g_23 : g , g_1,g_3 g_13 g_3,g_23,g_13 g_1233 : : g , g_1,g_2 g_12 : g , g_1,g_3 g_13 g_1,g_12,g_13g_123 : after some calculation these procedures lead to the following expressions of @xmath28 . : : 1 : g_123=g0 + g_1 ( ) + g_2 ( -+ ) -g_3 ( ) : 2 : g_123=g 0 -g_1 ( ) -g_2 ( ) + g_3 ( + + ) : these three expressions need to coincide .",
