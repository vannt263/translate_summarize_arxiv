    "radio surveys play a crucial role in the study of agn . searches for agn at radio wavelengths have several major advantages over other wavelength regimes , including : ( i ) the radio emission is often extremely powerful , and can be detected out to the highest redshifts ( e.g. sdssp  j083643.85 + 005453.3 at @xmath2 , fan et al .",
    "2001 ) , ( ii ) the most powerful radio sources at the highest redshifts pinpoint the most massive and luminous galaxies at such redshifts , allowing a detailed study , ( iii ) radio emission is not affected by dust emission , which often affects optical selection criteria .",
    "several major observational efforts have therefore been performed during the last 4 decades to identify the host galaxies of large samples of radio sources ( table  1 ) .",
    "these samples can be divided between ` complete ' flux limited surveys , and ` filtered ' surveys , designed to select the highest redshift objects .",
    "the advantage of the flux limited surveys is that , given sufficient spectroscopic redshift information , they can be used to derive the radio luminosity function ( rlf ; e. g. dunlop & peacock 1990 , willott et al .",
    "this rlf shows a strong increase between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and a possible decrease at larger redshifts is subject of considerable debate ( e.g. jarvis et al .",
    "2001b , waddington et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the main problem for establishing the high - z rlf is the small number of @xmath5 radio galaxies and quasars in the flux limited samples .    to find more high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ; @xmath5 ) ,",
    "additional selection criteria have been used to construct ` filtered ' surveys .",
    "the most successful of these is the selection of sources with ultra steep radio spectra ( uss ) , although others such as angular size upper limits have also been used .",
    "while the main explanation for the success of the uss criterion is a simple @xmath6correction of the generally concave radio spectrum , other effects could strengthen the @xmath7 correlation , including ( i ) the steepening of the rest - frame radio spectral index with radio power , and ( ii ) more important inverse compton losses at high redshift .",
    "table  1 shows that these filtered surveys reach fainter flux densities , and find objects with a mean redshift @xmath4 , while the flux limited surveys target brighter sources at @xmath8 .",
    "with the advent of several major radio surveys during the last decade ( table  2 ) , it is now possible to construct large , uniform samples of radio sources .",
    "we have started a program to find significant numbers of @xmath9 radio galaxies .",
    "our 3 samples consist of 669 uss sources , covering the entire sky outside the galactic plane ( see de  breuck et al .",
    "2000 ) . to derive spectral indices ,",
    "we combined the wenss and texas survey with the nvss . figure  1 and table  2 show that wenss is ideally matched in both resolution and sensitivity for such a uss sample . in the regions not covered by the wenss survey ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "we have used the shallower texas survey .",
    "more recently , we have also constructed a deeper sample in the @xmath11 region using the southern extension of the wenss , the westerbork in the southern hemisphere ( wish , de  breuck et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . at @xmath12 , we shall combine the sumss with the nvss to construct a first sensitive uss sample in the deep southern hemisphere .    at @xmath13 ,",
    "the extragalactic radio sky is even less explored , with several extremely luminous radio sources ( comparable to northern 3c sources ) remaining to be identified .",
    "burgess & hunstead ( 1994 ) describe the only observational effort to date to identify these intriguing objects .",
    "we have therefore also constructed the first uss sample at @xmath13 , using the mrc and pmn surveys . from this sample , we have already discovered one of the most powerful radio sources known : mp  j2045@xmath146018 at @xmath15 ( fig .  2 ) .    to identify the radio sources in our uss samples ,",
    "we first obtained high resolution radio images from the vla and atca .",
    "after an initial campaign of optical identifications , we switched to @xmath16band imaging using the keck and ctio telescopes ( de  breuck et al .",
    "even with moderately deep imaging ( @xmath1720 to @xmath1722 ) , we find an identification rate of @xmath1895% for the 86 sources observed in @xmath16band .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopy of 46 sources with 3 - 10 m class telescopes has yielded redshifts for 72% of these , with a mean redshift of @xmath19 ( de  breuck et al .",
    "2001 ) . from this sample",
    ", we have discovered the most distant radio galaxy known : tn  j0924@xmath142201 at @xmath0 ( van breugel et al .",
    "figure  3 shows the radio spectrum determined from multi - frequency vla imaging .",
    "the spectrum curves at high frequencies , consistent with what is seen in most powerful radio galaxies .",
    "our deep vla images ( fig .",
    "3 ) show a 125 double radio source , but no radio core .",
    "interestingly , despite integration times of 1h or more with the keck telescope , 5 sources show only a faint continuum emission , but no identifiable emission lines between 4000    and 9000   .",
    "these sources are possibly obscured agn , as suggested by the detection of several of these at ( sub)mm wavelengths ( reuland et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
