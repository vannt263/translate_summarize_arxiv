    "the latter could occur either if there is either true absorption ( e.g. , as in irs 46 ; lahuis et al .  2006 ) or emission from other features in the `` continuum '' regions that are used to define the index .",

    "what causes the strength of the hcn feature to differ in these systems ?",
    "although the sources have many similar properties ( e.g. , they have similar stellar masses and spectral types ) , the stellar accretion rate ( m@xmath37 ) and x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath35 ) do vary across the sample , as may other physical properties not described here . to investigate whether stellar accretion rate and x - ray luminosity play a role in determining the hcn emission strength , we compared the hcn fluxes of the sources in the sl sample with their values of m@xmath37 and l@xmath35 from the literature ( table 1 ) .    in figure [ fig_fp ] , panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) plot sl hcn flux against stellar accretion rate , stellar x - ray luminosity , and spectra type , respectively .",

    "the lack of a tight correlation is perhaps not surprising since many physical and chemical processes ( e.g. , heating that is unrelated to accretion , chemical synthesis , photodestruction , excitation conditions ) can potentially affect the strength of any given molecular emission feature . as a result ,",
    "outliers in any trend are to be expected , e.g. , if some systems have managed to synthesize more or less hcn .",
    "we therefore employed the following simple rejection scheme when examining our data for possible trends : we performed a weighted linear fit , including uncertainties in both the x- and y - directions , to all of the data in fig.[fig_fp]a , b , and c and iteratively rejected the top one to two outliers , all of which were above 3.3-@xmath38 . the outliers are plotted as open triangles in fig.[fig_fp ] , and a summary of the fit statistics is given in table [ tbl5 ] .",
    "table [ tbl5 ] also reports the reduced @xmath39 of the linear fit and @xmath40 , the probability that a correct model would give a @xmath39 value equal to or larger than the observed @xmath39 .    in the case of fig.[fig_fp]a , where we plot sl hcn flux versus stellar accretion rate , the pearson s _ r_-value associated with all of the data points shown is 0.53 and the @xmath28 value is 0.39 ( see table [ tbl5 ] ) .",
    "rejection of the top two outliers at 3.6@xmath41 and 3.8@xmath41 ( open symbols ) resulted in a pearson s _ r_-value associated with the remaining data points of 0.66 and the @xmath28 value of 0.57 ( see also table [ tbl5 ] ) , suggesting a potential positive correlation between stellar accretion rate and hcn flux .    even with outlier rejection , there is still significant scatter , which is perhaps to be expected , as discussed above .",
    "in addition , the difficulty in determining precise veiling and bolometric corrections likely introduces systematic uncertainty in stellar accretion rate measurements , as discussed by hartigan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and gullbring et al .",
    "these authors also note that time variability , as a result of intrinsic fluctuation in the accretion rate or the modulation of a nonaxisymmetric magnetosphere , can contribute to the uncertainty ; they suggest a cumulative uncertainty of @xmath23 in stellar accretion rate ( hartigan et al .",
    "1991 ; gullbring et al .",
    "we represent this uncertainty by the horizontal bar in the lower left corner of fig.[fig_fp]a .    for fig.[fig_fp]b , which shows sl hcn flux versus stellar x - ray luminosity , the associated pearson s _",

    "rejection of the top outlier at 3.3@xmath41 ( open symbol ) resulted in a pearson s _ r_-value associated with the remaining data points of 0.65 and the @xmath28 value of 0.59 ( see also table [ tbl5 ] ) , suggesting a potential positive correlation between stellar x - ray luminosity and hcn flux .",
    "the larger @xmath32 and p@xmath42 for these data ( compared to those shown in fig.[fig_fp]a or 4c ; see table [ tbl5 ] ) are partly a result of the smaller sample size _",
    "n _ ( 12 versus 18 objects ) . some of the scatter in this plot is likely the result of variability in l@xmath35 .",
    "gdel et al .",
    "2010 notes that the range of uncertainty in x - ray flux determination is dominated by variability on various time scales , and ( apart from singular flares ) is typically characterized by flux variations within a factor of two from low to high levels .",
    "we represent this uncertainty by the horizontal error bar in the lower left corner fig.[fig_fp]b .",
    "fig.[fig_fp]c shows sl hcn flux versus stellar spectral type .",

    "r_-value for all of the data points is @xmath60.54 and the @xmath28 value is @xmath60.41 ( see table [ tbl5 ] ) .",
    "rejection of the top outlier 3.5@xmath41 ( open symbol ) resulted in a pearson s _ r_-value associated with the remaining data points of @xmath60.56 and the @xmath28 value of @xmath60.49 ( see also table [ tbl5 ] ) .",
    "an estimated spectral type error of 0.5 subclass is much smaller than the dispersion of the points .",
    "while the statistics suggest a possible negative correlation between spectral type and hcn flux , it seems unlikely that spectral type ( and therefore stellar temperature ) directly affects the hcn flux from the disk ; while the hcn flux in our sample varies over almost an order of magnitude , the range of spectral types we studied is relatively narrow , spanning @xmath43k in temperature .",
    "fig.[fig_fp]d may shed some light on this issue .",
    "it shows that within our sample , x - ray luminosity decreases on average with later spectral type .",
    "the associated pearson s _ r_-value for all the objects plotted is @xmath60.46 , and the @xmath28 value is @xmath60.36 ( see table [ tbl5 ] ) .",
    "this modest correlation in our sample is also supported by larger samples of pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. , winston et al .",
    "2010 ; preibisch et al .",
    "2005 ) ; our examination of those data show a similar decrease in x - ray luminosity with later spectral type .",
    "this trend between x - ray luminosity and spectral type could be explained as a consequence of the rough proportionality between l@xmath35 and l@xmath33 in pre - main sequence stars , with l@xmath35/l@xmath4410@xmath4510@xmath46 ( telleschi et al .  2007 ;",
    "preibisch et al .",
    "2005 ) . among stars in myr - old populations such as those in our sample",
    ", l@xmath33 also decreases with later spectral type ( stelzer & neuhuser 2001 ; preibisch et al .",
    "2005 ; winston et al .",
    "2010 ) , so l@xmath35 would also be expected to decrease with later spectral type in our sample .",
    "thus , the trend in fig.[fig_fp]c may not reflect a fundamental relationship between hcn flux and spectral type , but instead results from the two underlying relations between l@xmath35 and hcn flux ( fig.[fig_fp]b ) and l@xmath35 decreasing with later spectral type ( fig.[fig_fp]d ) .",
    "another possibility is that the luminosity associated with accretion ( l@xmath47 ) is decreasing with later spectral type and this is what drives the trend of hcn flux with spectral type .",
    "the average accretion rate is known to decrease with decreasing mass ( later spectral type ) , but the spread at any given mass is @xmath2two orders of magnitude ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2005 ) . in fig.[fig_fp]e",
    ", we plot stellar accretion rate versus spectral type .",
    "there is no strong correlation ( see table [ tbl5 ] ) within the narrow range of spectral type of our sample , consistent with muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . in fig.[fig_fp]f",
    ", we plot the stellar x - ray luminosity versus the stellar accretion rate .",
    "the comparison also shows no correlation ( see table [ tbl5 ] ) .    because our data set is small ( and our analysis methods explorative ) , larger samples of irs spectra are needed to confirm that any trends exist and test whether any of the fits proposed are reasonable representations of the trend .",
    "our sample is artificially sparse at high accretion rates due to the difficulty in measuring hcn emission from low resolution spectra of high - accretion sources ; their enhanced continuum flux reduces the contrast of emission features above the continuum .",
    "thus it would be useful to expand the sample to include more sources covering the same range of stellar accretion rates as well as a larger range of accretion rates .",
    "if hcn flux and stellar accretion rate are correlated , we would expect that sources with accretion rates @xmath48 would have low to undetectable hcn fluxes .",
    "similarly , we would expect that sources with x - ray luminosities below @xmath49 erg s@xmath36 would not show detectable hcn , and that sources with x - ray luminosities above @xmath50 erg s@xmath36 might continue to show enhanced hcn emission with increasing x - ray flux .",
    "we find that sh and sl measurements of the @xmath51 m hcn feature are correlated in our small sample of t tauri stars .",
    "our results support the work of pascucci et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who used these sl spectra as part of their larger sample to deduce the differences between gaseous disks surrounding t tauri stars and those surrounding lower mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "that study showed a prominent difference in the relative detection rates of hcn and c@xmath4h@xmath4 between the two samples , with hcn detected more commonly in tts than in the lower mass objects .",
    "the median spectra they created of samples of t tauri stars and the lower mass objects showed that the flux ratio of hcn to c@xmath5h@xmath5 is @xmath23 for t tauri stars and much lower , @xmath20.2 , for the lower mass objects .",
    "our results show that such comparisons can be extended to comparisons of hcn feature fluxes in the spectra of individual objects .",
    "we also find potential trends between the sl hcn flux index and stellar accretion rate , x - ray luminosity , and stellar spectral type .",
    "with respect to the potential trend with stellar accretion rate , a similar relation between co fundamental emission and stellar accretion rate has been reported in tts and herbig ae - be stars ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ; brittain et al .",
    "these authors suggest that a correlation between co emission and accretion rate would be expected if accretion - related processes heat the disk atmosphere . in a related study of transition objects , salyk et al .",
    "( 2009 ) report that the sources in their sample that show inner - disk co fundamental emission have higher accretion rates .",
    "the sources that display co fundamental emission also display pf@xmath52 emission , which is moderately correlated with the accretion diagnostic h@xmath53 .",
    "accretion - related processes could strengthen the hcn emission by enhancing the temperature , and/or the hcn abundance , in the disk atmosphere .",
    "the effect of accretion - related heating on disk molecular emission has been studied by glassgold et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2009 ) .",
    "they proposed two sources of mechanical heating in the disk atmosphere : viscous accretion , possibly generated by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; stone et al .",
    "2000 ) , and stellar wind interaction with the disk surface ( glassgold et al .",
    "glassgold et al .",
    "( 2009 ) invoked mechanical heating , due to one or both of these sources , in addition to the formation of h@xmath5 on warm grains , to explain the large column densities of warm h@xmath4o that are observed in emission in disk atmospheres .",
    "glassgold et al .",
    "( 2009 ) determined that these processes can increase the thickness of the warm water column to the extent reported by carr & najita ( 2008 ) and salyk et al .",
    "if mechanical heating does affect the thermal - chemical structure of disk atmospheres in this way , and if higher accretion rates and higher rates of mechanical heating derive from the same physical mechanism , we would expect to see a correlation between accretion rate and h@xmath4o feature strength .",
    "accretion rate may play a similar role in enhancing hcn emission strength , i.e. by increasing the column density of warm hcn in the disk atmosphere",
    ".    there may be an additional chemical connection between h@xmath4o and hcn emission , with efficient water formation possibly leading to an enhanced hcn abundance . as described by lahuis & van dishoeck ( 2000 )",
    ", efficient h@xmath5o formation will drive most of the available oxygen into h@xmath5o , resulting in a lower abundance of gaseous o@xmath5 .",
    "since o@xmath5 would otherwise react with atomic carbon , the lack of o@xmath5 could lead to an enhanced atomic c abundance and in turn a larger hcn abundance ( e.g. , via the reaction scheme described by agundez et al .",
    "perhaps for this reason , hot cores that are found to have the highest gas phase h@xmath4o abundances are also those with the highest hcn abundances ( e.g. , van dishoeck 1998 ; lahuis & van dishoeck 2000 ) .",
    "thus accretion - related mechanical heating in disks may enhance disk hcn emission both thermally , by producing a deeper temperature inversion at the disk surface , and chemically , by enhancing the hcn abundance as a consequence of efficient water formation .",
    "detailed modeling is needed to explore these possibilities .    increased uv irradiation produced by higher stellar accretion",
    "may also enhance the hcn abundance .",
    "using agndez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) as a guide , pascucci et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argued that the hcn abundance in disk atmospheres may be limited by the availability of atomic nitrogen and that the atomic nitrogen abundance depends primarily on the dissociation of n@xmath5 via uv - dissociation .",
    "thus , hcn would be brighter for sources with more energetic uv flux ( i.e. , higher accretion rate ) , while c@xmath5h@xmath5 ( not requiring nitrogen to form ) would not vary .",
    "this may explain their finding that t tauri stars have stronger hcn emission relative to c@xmath5h@xmath5 than lower mass stars and brown dwarfs , as these lower mass objects would have lower photospheric uv emission and lower accretion rates than tts .",
    "the range in stellar accretion rate among t tauri stars may induce a range in their hcn abundances for similar reasons .",
    "another factor that may play a role in setting the hcn flux from the disk is x - ray irradiation , based on fig.[fig_fp]b .",
    "the effect of x - ray irradiation on the thermal - chemical structure of disks has been investigated previously by glassgold et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2009 ) , although they did not specifically study hcn .",
    "x - ray irradiation may enhance the abundance of molecular ions and radicals that lead to enhanced hcn emission .",
    "further modeling is needed to investigate the relative roles of x - ray and uv irradiation in this context .",
    "we find a possible trend of hcn flux decreasing with stellar spectral type ( fig.[fig_fp]c ) . while this is in the spirit of the trend found by pascucci et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , it is unlikely that stellar spectral type itself ( i.e. , stellar temperature ) is affecting the hcn flux for this small sample of tts .",
    "the other two processes we examined , stellar accretion rate and stellar x - ray flux ( and/or other processes not yet identified ) are likely to have a more direct influence on the hcn flux .",
    "stellar accretion rate is not well correlated with spectral type ( see fig.[fig_fp]e ) and the tts in our sample span a small mass range , so the resulting accretion luminosity seems unlikely to be correlated over the range of spectral types that we studied . in comparison",
    ", l@xmath35 shows a possible correlation with spectral type ( fig.[fig_fp]d ) , so it may be responsible for the moderate correlation of hcn flux with spectral type .",
    "several of the objects in our sample ( plotted as open triangles in fig.[fig_fp]a , b , and c ) appear to deviate from the possible trends we identify here .",
    "the dispersion we observe could arise from differences in disk structure ( e.g. , flaring ) and composition that may originate from the natal environment as well as the dynamic processing that occurs within the disk lifetime .",
    "this makes the objects that deviate from our observed trends not only expected , but of particular interest .",
    "for example , while variations in stellar accretion rate are typically factors of @xmath22 or less ( hartigan et al .",
    "1991 ) , stellar accretion rates of some individual sources may vary up to an order of magnitude on timescales of @xmath21 yr ( alencar & batalha 2002 ) .",
    "this could induce a significant shift for some objects in our plots .",
    "variability in the stellar accretion rate could also affect the time - averaged disk chemistry .",
    "similar considerations might apply for stellar x - ray variability .",
    "another potential cause of dispersion is a different or additional heating source .",
    "the strength of the uv irradiation striking the disk may depend on the absorption along the line - of - sight , e.g. , in a magnetosphere or an intervening wind ( e.g. , alexander et al .",
    "2004 ; ercolano et al .  2008 , 2009 ;",
    "gorti & hollenbach 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "this could influence the temperature and chemical processing of the disk atmosphere , as might radial transport or vertical mixing between the upper layer and regions closer to the disk midplane ( e.g. , bergin et al .  2007",
    "; turner et al .  2006 ; semenov et al .",
    "2006 ; willacy et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "dust sedimentation can also increase the line - to - continuum contrast of molecular emission ( glassgold et al .",
    "2004 ; dullemond et al .",
    "2007 ) , and such emission is more commonly detected in more highly settled disks ( salyk et al.2011 ) .",
    "the properties and distribution of grains are known to vary widely over disk age and structure ( e.g. , watson et al .",
    "if molecular formation ( e.g. , h@xmath4 ) on grains influences disk chemical synthesis , variations in grain properties may lead to variations in observable molecular features ( glassgold et al .",
    "in the panels of figure [ fig_fp ] , there are several outlying points whose hcn flux index is enhanced or depleted relative to the rest of the points",
    ". these might be ideal systems in which to look for additional chemical peculiarity or heating mechanisms that could be affecting the molecular emission strength .",
    "the trends described here require a larger sample to confirm . in tandem",

    "irs modules that cover a wider wavelength range ( i.e. , long - high , 20@xmath10m@xmath640@xmath10 m ) and more molecular species .",
