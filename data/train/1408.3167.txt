    "observations of galaxy clusters in the radio regime have revealed low - surface brightness and large - scale non - thermal emission up to mpc - scales associated with the periphery and central regions of some galaxy clusters ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the origin of this radio emission does not appear to be directly associated with the activity of individual galaxies within the cluster but rather pervades the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "these radio sources are known as radio halos and relics and share some observational properties : they both have steep synchrotron spectra and @xmath3 is the spectral index . ]",
    "( @xmath3 @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) and are characterised by very low - surface brightness emission ( @xmath6jyarcsec@xmath7 at 1.4ghz ) .",
    "radio halos and relics differ in their polarisation properties and locations within galaxy clusters : radio halos are unpolarised , at current detection levels @xcite , and located towards the centre of the host galaxy cluster , whilst relics are highly polarised and reside on the periphery of the galaxy cluster .",
    "the presence of radio halos and relics within galaxy clusters is direct evidence that magnetic fields and relativistic particles exist within the icm .",
    "radio relics are believed to be generated by the acceleration of electrons by the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism ( first - order fermi process ) in shocks propagating to the cluster periphery after a major merger event @xcite .",
    "these electrons are embedded within the cluster wide magnetic fields and so emit synchrotron radiation .",
    "the mechanism by which radio halos emit and maintain the observed synchrotron emission is a topic of debate .",
    "this is because electrons emitting via the synchrotron mechanism have limited lifetimes and some as yet unknown mechanism must exist to ( re-)accelerate the electrons within the icm to maintain the observed levels of synchrotron emission in radio halos .",
    "any theory that seeks to explain the origin of radio halos within the icm must be able to describe how relativistic electrons are reaccelerated .",
    "two mechanisms are favoured in the literature : primary acceleration of electrons due to turbulence @xcite and secondary production of electron / positron pairs due to hadronic collisions between cosmic - ray protons and thermal protons @xcite .",
    "sensitive low - frequency observations of a large sample of clusters should be able to distinguish which of these models is responsible for generating radio halos @xcite .",
    "one of the primary observable differences between these two models is that the turbulent re - acceleration model predicts a population of radio halos with ultra - steep spectra ( @xmath8 ) . to date radio halos",
    "have been commonly observed at @xmath9ghz frequencies where emission from ultra - steep spectrum halos is weak and easily missed .",
    "observations at low frequency should be able to detect these ultra - steep spectrum radio halos .    in a small number of clusters",
    "a `` bridge '' of radio emission has been observed connecting relics on the periphery of the cluster with the halo at the centre .",
    "these radio bridges are characterised by a filament of low surface brightness emission that extends over hundreds of kilo - parsecs . only a few examples of radio bridges",
    "have been observed such as in the coma cluster , a2255 , a2744 @xcite and recently in a3667 @xcite .",
    "the origin of radio bridges is unknown ; they could simply be the result of projection effects whereby extended radio emission is seen projected against the galaxy cluster .",
    "alternatively , a radio bridge may be a feature that has formed alongside the radio relic during a merger event and is the result of shocks and turbulence accelerating the local electron population @xcite .",
    "to date it has been difficult to construct a large sample of these radio features due to a lack of instrumentation capable of surveying a large extent of the sky at low frequency with adequate sensitivity . with the advent of instruments such as the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; @xcite ) and the low frequency array ( lofar ; @xcite ) we now have the ability to carry out such observations . in this study",
    "we aim to observe a single galaxy cluster that is reported to host all three of these extended radio features , at low frequency using the mwa , as a preliminary step towards further such detections .",
    "the target of our study is the well - known galaxy cluster a3667 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "optical studies of the galaxy members within a3667 @xcite have revealed that a3667 is relatively nearby with an average redshift of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "optical observations have also revealed a high galaxy density within a3667 , with an elongated spatial distribution of galaxies in the se to nw direction .",
    "many authors propose that this elongation coupled with the high velocity dispersion of cluster members ( @xmath13kms@xmath14 ) is an indication of a recent or ongoing merger between two sub - clusters in the plane of the sky .",
    "numerous x - ray observations of a3667 @xcite have probed the physical properties of the hot gas that exists within the icm of a3667 .",
    "the cluster is found to have an x - ray luminosity of @xmath15ergss@xmath14 in the 0.12.4kev range @xcite with a temperature profile that is also elongated in the se to nw direction and shows a sharp change in temperature at the nw periphery of the cluster .",
    "these x - ray features also suggest that a3667 has undergone a merger event and that shocked regions should be present on the periphery of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the most prominent features of a3667 are two large and bright radio relics located on the nw and se periphery of the cluster .",
    "these nw and se relics have integrated flux densities of @xmath16 and @xmath17jy at 1.4ghz , respectively , @xcite and extend over approximately @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "numerous radio observations of a3667 ( e.g. , @xcite ) have noted the bright extended structures in a3667 but failed to image the entire extent of both relics .",
    "the first study of the entire region at high resolution ( @xmath20 ) , including both the nw and se relics , was carried out by @xcite at 1.4ghz .",
    "these observations revealed a complex filamentary flux density distribution with an average spectral index , between 0.8 and 1.4ghz , of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the nw and se relics , respectively .",
    "the spectral index was found to vary considerably over both relics with a range of @xmath23 to @xmath5 for the nw relic and @xmath23 to @xmath24 for the se relic .",
    "the spectral index of the se relic is found to have a spatial gradient with a flatter spectral index at the leading edge of the relic , steepening towards the centre of the cluster @xcite .",
    "recent observations of a3667 at 2.3 and 3.3ghz report the detection of a putative radio bridge connecting the nw relic to the centre of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the presence of a faint radio halo in the centre of the cluster has also been reported @xcite .",
    "the only study of a3667 below 300mhz was performed more than five decades ago by @xcite at 86mhz using the mills cross telescope with a resolution of @xmath25 .",
    "the large angular extent and high surface brightness of the relics and the detection of a faint radio halo and bridge ( at frequencies of 1.43.3ghz ) in a3667 make it an excellent laboratory in which to carry out low frequency observations to study the icm .    in this paper",
    "we present the first mwa observations of a3667 between 105 and 241mhz .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sect : obs ] we present the observations and discuss the data reduction process . in section  [ sect : results ] we present the results of these observations including images of the radio data , integrated flux density estimates of emission features and a spectral index map of a3667 . in section  [",
    "sect : discussion ] we discuss our results for the nw and se radio relics and search for the presence of a radio halo and bridge in a3667 .",
    "we end with a brief outline of future prospects with the mwa and our conclusions in section  [ sect : summary ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the following cosmological parameters : @xmath26kms@xmath14mpc@xmath14 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that at the redshift of a3667 ( 0.0553 ) @xmath29kpc .",
    "the mwa is a new radio telescope operating in the low - frequency regime between 80 and 300mhz .",
    "details of the technical design and specifications of the mwa is given by @xcite and a review of the performance properties and scientific goals is presented by @xcite .",
    "consisting of 128 `` tiles '' of @xmath30 dipole antennas , which are concentrated in a dense core @xmath31 km in diameter in order to achieve high surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "a3667 was observed with the mwa on the 9@xmath32 of june 2013 using 114 tiles of the full 128-tile array . at the time of observation",
    ", these observations utilised the most complete array to date and represent a good approximation of the capabilities of the complete mwa .",
    "the observations comprise of four 30.720mhz wide sub - bands centred on 120.335 , 149.135 , 179.855 and 225.935mhz ( hereafter 120 , 149 , 180 and 226mhz ) .",
    "the mwa forms beams on the sky using analogue beam formers @xcite whereby the beam is moved by changing the beam former delays by incremental amounts .",
    "this moves the primary beam centre and results in a change in the overall shape of the beam response .",
    "each frequency band was observed consecutively with the same delay settings before repeating with new delays to keep a3667 in the centre of the field .",
    "snapshot observations of @xmath33 seconds were obtained at each central frequency between an hour angle of 21 and 22 hours .",
    "the minimum and maximum baselines were 7.7 and 2864 m , respectively , which provides sensitivity to structures from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the combined @xmath36-coverage of three snapshots at 149mhz , excluding multi - frequency synthesis ( mfs ) , can be seen in fig .",
    "[ im : uvcoverage ] .",
    "this figure uses hexagonal binning to visualise the @xmath36 plane which contains @xmath37 @xmath36 points .",
    "hexagonal binning tessellates the @xmath36 plane using a regular grid of hexagons , the number of @xmath36 points that fall within each hexagonal bin is counted and a logarithmic colour - scale is used to represent the total number of @xmath36 points within each hexagonal bin .",
    "the extensive @xmath36-coverage at short baselines provides excellent sensitivity to large - scale structure , however the maximum baseline limits the resolution of these observations to @xmath35 .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of the primary beam at the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) is approximately @xmath38 and @xmath39 at 120 and 226mhz , respectively .",
    "points for a combined @xmath33s observation centred on a single channel at 149mhz .",
    "each hexagonal bin has a width of 0.006k@xmath40 and the colour scale indicates the logarithm of the number of @xmath36 points within each hexagonal bin.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]        this method is dependent on the number of sources available for interpolation and the accuracy of the flux density estimate for each source taken from the literature . due to the low number of sources available ,",
    "we are conservative in our flux density error estimate at each band . the residual flux density offset after applying this interpolation method ranges from 219% with an average error of 9% ( table  [ tab : fluxresults ] ) .",
    "we use an average of the offsets for the two test sources pmnj2017 - 5747 and pmnj2004 - 5534 at each frequency for our flux density calibration errors .",
    "this gives a percentage flux density error of 9.1% , 9.4% , 4.9% and 10.8% at 120 , 149 , 180 and 226mhz , respectively . from the grid of correction values in fig .",
    "[ im : correction ] , we find that the value of the flux density offset is approximately constant over the area of the nw relic of a3667 ( 05 ) .",
    "this method leads to slightly non - gaussian background noise on large scales and an elevated noise level of 83.3 , 50.0 , 39.5 and 35.1mjybeam@xmath14 at 120 , 149 , 180 , 226mhz , respectively .",
    "however , because this technique is multiplicative , the signal - to - noise ratio remains the same as for the uncorrected images ."
