    "the evolution in the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the universe over the course of cosmic history is a measure of great importance that has many applications in various fields of astrophysics .",
    "in addition to the obvious applications to the build - up of stellar mass in galaxies , other examples include constraining the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) @xcite , testing models of chemical evolution in the universe @xcite , constraints on the nature of both type ia supernovae @xcite and gamma - ray bursts @xcite and comparisons with global agn activity and the growth of black holes @xcite .",
    "sfrs of galaxies have been measured by a variety of methods , at different wavelengths .",
    "these include : sfrs determined from the far- and mid - infrared produced by the re - emission of ultraviolet ( uv ) photons by dust grains , revealing hidden star formation @xcite ; sfrs measured from radio emission produced by relativistic electrons in supernova remnants @xcite ; nebular emission lines such as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11}$ ] , produced by the recombination of ionized gas surrounding hot young ob stars @xcite ; and x - ray emission produced by x - ray binary systems in late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "more directly , sfrs have been measured from the uv luminosities of galaxies produced from short lived ob stars ( lifetimes @xmath12 yr ) .",
    "early studies such as @xcite and @xcite used this to establish that the volume - averaged sfr of the universe has been in decline since @xmath13 to the present day . although later studies @xcite measured the decline with improved precision , it is still poorly constrained and its cause is still a major problem in the field of observational cosmology .    as an alternative to the far uv luminosity , the _ u_-band ( @xmath14 nm ) luminosity of a galaxy , predominantly emitted by young stars of ages @xmath15 gyr , has been shown to be a reasonable tracer of star formation @xcite . using _",
    "u_-band has two main advantages over the far uv , because i ) more data are available to improve the statistics and ii ) it is less affected by extinction .",
    "@xcite find that at @xmath16 , the fraction of photons to escape through the dust from the local galaxy population is @xmath17 per cent in the _ u_-band as opposed to @xmath18 per cent at 200-nm .",
    "one disadvantage of the _ u_-band as a tracer of star formation is the contribution from old stellar populations , which is dominant in early - type galaxies and small in star forming galaxies .",
    "this has to be accounted for .",
    "so far _ u_-band field luminosity functions ( lfs ) have been produced by @xcite for data release 2 ( dr2 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) main sample , by @xcite for the sdss _",
    "u_-band galaxy survey ( _ u_gs ) and more recently by @xcite using dr6 , probing volumes out to @xmath19 . in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis to higher redshift , by combining samples of galaxies taken from the sdss _ u_gs and the deep evolutionary exploratory probe 2 ( deep2 ) survey , to produce lfs in the range @xmath1 , which represents @xmath20 gyr of cosmic history from when the universe was @xmath21 gyr old .",
    "selected by _",
    "r_-band , the deep2 survey is ideally suited for comparison to the sdss _ u_gs as _ r_-band magnitudes at @xmath13 correspond to rest _ u_-band magnitudes .",
    "we go on to produce colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) from the data and make use of the observed colour bimodality @xcite to separate the narrow band of red , passive galaxies and blue star forming populations of galaxies .",
    "integration of the lfs produced from these separate populations allows the luminosity density , or total output of _ u_-band light in a given volume to be determined .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 describes the deep2 survey and sdss _ u_gs , and the data reduction employed to obtain our final galaxy samples . in section 3 the methods required to calculate the luminosity functions including completeness corrections and k corrections are described , and we present rest - frame cmds displaying how the red and blue populations are separated . in section 4",
    "we present the luminosity functions , fitted schechter parameters and luminosity densities .",
    "our results are then compared with the observations at different wavelengths and we discuss our estimate of the evolution of sfr of the universe in section 5 .",
    "section 6 contains a summary of our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 .",
    "magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using dust maps of @xcite .",
    "the deep evolutionary exploratory probe 2 ( deep2 ) survey @xcite is a redshift survey primarily designed to probe the properties of galaxies at redshift z @xmath25 1 . when fully complete the spectra of around 50000 galaxies with redshifts @xmath26 will have been measured over an area of sky totalling 3.5 deg@xmath27 .    in this paper",
    "we use data from the third data release , dr3 , which comprises two catalogues : photometric and spectroscopic .",
    "the photometric catalogue contains the @xmath28 and @xmath29 magnitudes of 716465 objects ( including stars and duplicate objects ) obtained with the @xmath30 mosaic camera @xcite on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii - telescope .",
    "the spectroscopic catalogue contains redshifts and spectra of 46337 objects measured by the deimos spectrograph @xcite with wavelength range @xmath31 nm and resolution @xmath32 on the 10 m keck 2 telescope .",
    "galaxies selected for redshift measurements are limited to apparent ab magnitudes in the range @xmath33 .",
    "the survey area is separated into 4 regions of the sky and is made up of a 0.5 sq .",
    "deg . field known as the extended groth strip ( egs ) and three 1.0 sq .",
    "fields designated fields 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "galaxies in fields 2 , 3 and 4 are preselected by their @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath29 magnitudes using colour cuts , to have estimated redshifts @xmath36 .",
    "no such preselection was carried out for the egs which means that there is an approximately equal number of galaxies below and above @xmath37 in this region .      before determining",
    "the luminosity functions , stars and duplicate objects had to be removed from the deep2 catalogues and it was also useful to cut the area of the photometric catalogue , due to the spectroscopic catalogue not yet covering the same area as the photometric catalogue .",
    "the methods used to reduce the catalogues to obtain a final sample of galaxies used in this paper are described in this section .",
    "the first reduction of the photometric catalogue was to cut down the areas of the photometric survey in each field , so that the areas of the photometric and incomplete spectroscopic catalogues are the same .",
    "177680 objects in the photometric catalogue were cut , reducing it to 538785 .",
    "the second procedure was to discard galaxies with magnitudes outside the range @xmath38 , to give the spectroscopic and photometric catalogues equal magnitude limits .",
    "this removed 313362 objects from the photometric catalogue and 58 objects from the spectroscopic catalogue . after matching up the spectroscopic object numbers with those in the photometric catalogue ,",
    "6 objects were found to have no corresponding object number in the photometric catalogue .",
    "these 6 objects were removed from the spectroscopic catalogue .",
    "after this reduction the photometric and spectroscopic catalogues contained 225423 and 46279 objects respectively .",
    "the third reduction was to remove stars from the catalogue .",
    "objects in the photometric catalogue are designated a quantity , pgal @xcite , that gives the probability of an observed object being a galaxy or not .",
    "this probability is determined from star - galaxy separations calculated from the magnitudes , sizes and colours of the objects . resolved sources i.e. those which are definitely galaxies",
    "are given a pgal value of 3 whereas unresolved sources are given a probability of being a galaxy between 0 and 1 .",
    "in this investigation it was decided to use objects with pgal @xmath39 as in @xcite .",
    "the final reduction was to remove galaxies in the catalogues that had been observed multiple times and designated different object numbers .",
    "these duplicated observations for objects were identified by running a procedure to find and match objects within 0.5 arc - seconds of each other .",
    "the matched objects with the best redshift quality and smallest error in @xmath35 mag , were used to produce the luminosity functions .",
    "the duplicate objects with poorer data were then removed from the photometric and spectroscopic catalogues .",
    "these two further processes reduced the photometric catalogue by 58824 to 166599 galaxies .",
    "629 objects in the spectroscopic catalogue which had object numbers corresponding to galaxies removed from the photometric catalogue , were also removed , leaving 45650 objects in the spectroscopic catalogue .",
    "the properties of the reduced fields can be seen in table [ table1 ] .",

    "the red population luminosity density appears to be almost constant , a result also found by @xcite and @xcite who conclude this can be explained by passive fading being compensated by a build up in the stellar mass density .",
    "note also that the fit to the evolution for the blue population ld has a lower @xmath49 than the fit for the red population .",
    "this is not surprising because the cosmic variance is larger for the more clustered red population @xcite .",
    "in fact if the larger error bars from @xmath50 ( table  [ table4 ] ) are used when fitting , the best fit shows a marginally rising ld with @xmath51 rather than declining as in the figure .",

    "the values of this summation for the combined , blue and red populations can be found in tables  [ table3 ] , [ table4 ] and [ table5 ] .",

    "the range in magnitudes @xmath50 applies to depends on the magnitude limits of the survey and is always less than the fitted magnitude range of @xmath55 . as a consequence the fraction @xmath56 ranges from 1.05 to 0.53 for the combined sample of galaxies , 1.05 to 0.63 for the red population , and 1.0 to 0.52 for the blue population",
    "this indicates that @xmath55 is never more than a factor of 2 extrapolation from @xmath50 . by binning the summed ld in 0.2 mag bins and redshift slices ,",

    "the plots for the combined and blue populations clearly show that as well as the total ld increasing with redshift , the galaxies that contribute most to the ld increase in brightness with redshift .",
    "this illustrates ` downsizing ' , first observed by @xcite and also found in more recent studies @xcite , where the brighter , more massive galaxies form their stars at higher redshift than the lower luminosity galaxies .",

    "we can estimate the evolution in the sfr density of the universe from the _ u_-band ld evolution by considering just the blue population . by doing this",
    "we effectively remove most of the contribution of _ u_-band luminosity produced by old stellar populations ( passive red galaxies ) .    in order to obtain an estimate of the evolution in the sfr density",
    ", we first have to consider the residual _ u_-band luminosity produced by the old population of stars ( @xmath96 gyr ) in blue galaxies .",
    "to do this we perform an analysis using pegase @xcite models to determine the contribution of _ u_-band luminosity from young stars with ages @xmath97 gyr old . in these models",
    "we assume an imf of @xcite , with solar metallicity and constant star formation rate between a formation redshift ( @xmath98 ) and an observed redshift ( @xmath99 ) . for a model with @xmath100 , the fraction of the _ u_-band luminosity from young stars changes from 0.88 at @xmath101 to 0.83 at @xmath102 . for @xmath103 ,",
    "the fraction changes from 0.9 at @xmath104 to 0.84 at @xmath102 .",
    "the assumption that blue galaxies in general form their stars at a quasi - constant rate can be justified considering that studies , such as @xcite , have shown low mass galaxies to have had a roughly constant star formation rate and @xcite find the same result for local late - type galaxies . if the fraction of _ u_-band luminosity produced by young stars changes by these amounts from @xmath105 to @xmath16 the evolution in the ld evolution with the contribution from old stellar populations removed is @xmath106 .",
    "the second correction to estimate the evolution in sfr density is to consider an increase in dust attenuation from @xmath16 to @xmath105 , as luminosities of characteristic galaxies at higher redshifts are brighter as found by @xcite and more luminous / higher sfr galaxies have higher dust attenuation than faint systems @xcite . for a simple analysis of how much the dust attenuation increases from @xmath16 to @xmath105",
    ", we use the magnitudes of the galaxies contributing the most to the ld at @xmath16 and @xmath107 . using fig .",
    "[ ldconblue ] , it can be seen that the main contribution to the luminosity density at @xmath108 peaks at @xmath109 and at @xmath16 it peaks at @xmath110 .",
    "converting these typical galaxy magnitudes into flux , we determine the star formation rate ( in @xmath111 yr@xmath24 ) of the galaxies , uncorrected for dust , using the equation of @xcite , which is a conversion taken from @xcite multiplied by a factor of 5.5 to account for stars with masses @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113    dust corrected star formation rates are obtained from eq . 7 in @xcite using the sfrs of the typical galaxies .",
    "the difference between the corrected and uncorrected sfrs gives an effective dust attenuation of @xmath114 mag at @xmath16 and @xmath115 at @xmath116 which equates to photon escape fraction of @xmath117 at @xmath118 and @xmath119 at @xmath105 .",
    "this is comparable to the results of @xcite who find the photon escape fraction to be @xmath120 using the local galaxies .",

    "galex _ sample of galaxies in the local universe to be @xmath121 in the nuv ( 230-nm ) and @xmath122 for the 150-nm fuv .",
    "the dust corrected evolution in the ld for the blue galaxies is essentially the evolution in the sfr density of the universe excluding dusty star forming _ red _ galaxies and possibly the most extreme objects with hidden star formation such as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) .",
