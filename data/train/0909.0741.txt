    "it has been known for three decades that nearby spiral galaxies contain a multitude of x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "observations of the milky way and local group galaxies have shown that the brightest of these sources are low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) . in these systems ,",
    "material is transfered at a high rate via roche lobe overflow from a low mass star onto a compact companion ( a white dwarf , neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "their x - ray spectra are broadly characterized by a power law with photon index @xmath32.5 @xcite .",
    "high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) are powered by bondi - hoyle accretion from the stellar winds of a young , high mass star onto a compact object . they typically have much harder spectra than lmxb   ( photon index @xmath4=0 - 1.5 , @xcite ) the accretion rates are lower than for roche lobe overflow sources and the corresponding x - ray luminosities also lower @xcite .",
    "in addition to the basic classification depending on the mass of the secondary , many other groups of sources have been identified depending on their x - ray spectra and variability properties .",
    "for example , so - called super soft sources ( sss ) , believed to be binaries with white dwarf primaries accreting matter at a highly super - eddington rate @xcite have essentially all of their flux below 1kev , and are highly variable @xcite .",
    "supernova remnants are also known to be strong x - ray sources @xcite . for a review of x - ray sources in galaxies",
    "see @xcite .    in the closest galaxies , clues as to the nature of x - ray sources",
    "can be derived from the optical environments and/or counterparts @xcite .",
    "however , it is more difficult to identify x - ray sources in galaxies which are too distant for optical counterparts to be detected and where there are not enough counts to get an x - ray spectrum . in @xcite",
    "we suggested that x - ray colors are a good starting point for source classification .",
    "we found that the x - ray colors of the sources described above ( low and high mass binaries , sss , and snr ) lie in different parts of the x - ray color - color diagram , albeit with some overlap of source types .",
    "in particular , sources in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges fall in a well defined region of the x - ray color - color diagram .",
    "we suggest that this population is dominated by low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "we find very few sources with hard hmxb  colors , which is to be expected given their low x - ray luminosities .",
    "we also find a population of faint x - ray soft sources in disk galaxies not seen in bulges .",
    "these soft / thermal sources are clearly associated with star formation , and are likely a mix of supernova remnants and accretion powered sources ( see also @xcite ) .    in this paper , we further investigate the properties of hard ( or lmxb ) and soft sources by constructing color segregated x - ray luminosity functions ( xlfs ) . our motivation is to confirm our interpretation that the hard sources are dominated by lmxbs and to better understand the mix of objects that fall into the soft class . in section  [ sec : s&s ]",
    "we describe our galaxy sample and completeness simulations and in section  [ sec : fitting ] we describe fits to hard and soft sources . in section  [ sec : pop ] we compare our results to previous work and discuss the origin of soft sources .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : s&c ] .",
    "most spiral galaxies have 10 - 50 x - ray sources , so that it is impossible to construct statistically significant color segregated luminosity functions for a single galaxy .",
    "we therefore constructed color - segregated xlfs  by coadding hard and soft sources from 11 spiral galaxies .",
    "the galaxies chosen for this work were observed as a _",
    "chandra _   large project in cycle 2 ( see @xcite for details of data reduction and a complete source list ) .",
    "they are all nearby ( @xmath5 10 mpc ) , face on spirals with low foreground absorption .",
    "the x - ray colors of sources in this sample are therefore relatively insensitive to patchy local absorption and the inclination of the galaxy .",
    "we use color definitions hard color ( @xmath6 ) and soft color ( @xmath7 ) introduced by @xcite :    @xmath8 @xmath9    here @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are counts in the soft ( 0.3 - 1 kev ) , medium ( 1 - 2 kev ) and hard ( 2 - 8 kev ) bands respectively and @xmath13 .",
    "we define soft and hard source colors as follows :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     these regions are shown on a color - color diagram in figure  [ xcols ] .",
    "the composite xlfs  for soft and hard sources sources are shown in figures  [ soft_xlf ] and [ hard_xlf ] .",
    "inspection of these figures suggest that the soft sources are well represented by a single power law .",
    "in contrast , the xlf  of the hard sources starts to flatten at @xmath14@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the flattening of the xlf  may be due to a real change in the properties of the sources or an artifact due to incompleteness ( or a combination of both ) .",
    "there are several factors that affect the detection threshold for x - ray sources , including the presence of diffuse emission and the distance of the source from the aimpoint .",
    "in addition , acis - s  was significantly more sensitive to soft emission ( @xmath5 1 kev ) in cycle 2 than to harder sources ; this will result in a different completeness limit for hard and soft sources .",
    "we construct simulated xlf  to help distinguish between a real break in the xlf  and incompletemess effects .",
    "we use the `` backward '' method described by @xcite to ascertain the completeness limit of each galaxy for a given source type ( hard or soft ) .",
    "this method involves simulating a source with the appropriate spectrum , and adding the simulated source to the real galaxy data .",
    "the source detection algorithm used for the original galaxy source list is then run again to determine whether the `` fake '' source is detected .",
    "approximately 20,000 soft sources and 20,000 hard sources are added to each galaxy , sprinkled randomly over the area within @xmath15 .",
    "we use a power law of photon index 1.2 to simulate hard sources and a power law of photon index 3.0 to simulate soft sources .",
    "the detect algorithm was run on the full band image , as was also the case for the galaxy analysis",
    ". the ratio of the number of input to the number of detected sources at a given luminosity is the key factor : when this falls below 100% the sample is not complete . in order to construct a composite xlf , we added sources to luminosity bins where the completness fell below 100% .",
    "for each galaxy , sources were added to the xlf  according to the following formula :    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the number of sources added to the bin of luminosity @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the fractional completeness , defined as the ratio of the number of input to the number of sources detected in simulations .",
    "@xmath20 is the number of real sources in the galaxy with luminosity @xmath18 .",
    "we find that the soft source population is 100% complete down to 3.9@xmath21 erg s@xmath2   for most galaxies ( m101 , ic 5332 , m94 , m51 , m83 , ngc 2681 , m74 and ngc 1291 ) .",
    "no sources were added to the xlf  for these galaxies .",
    "we omit galaxies ngc 4314 , ngc 3184 and ngc 278 from the soft source composite xlf  because they are less than 40% complete at 3.9@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "detection of hard sources was complete down to 7.5@xmath21 erg s@xmath2  for galaxies ic 5332 , m101 , m51 , m83 , ngc 2681 , ngc 278 and ngc 628 .",
    "sources were added to the lowest luminosity bins of the remaining galaxies as summarized in table  [ hard_comp ] .",
    "in addition to correcting for completeness in the lowest luminosity bins , we also removed bright nuclear sources from the complosite xlfs . in many cases these are weak liners and not x - ray binaries .",
    "the method used for fitting is described by @xcite and full details can be found in that paper .",
    "here we give a brief summary of the procedure .",
    "we fit a single power law to the unbinned , differential , composite xlfs using a maximum likelihood statistic @xcite .",
    "the xlfs  were corrected for completeness as described in the previous section .",
    "the single power law has the functional form :    @xmath22    the goodness - of - fit estimate is performed by simulating a luminosity distribution with the best fit slope .",
    "one million iterations were performed .",
    "if the data are well fit by a single power law the goodness - of - fit statistic ( gof ) approaches 1.0 .",
    "the contribution of cosmic background sources to the xlf  was evaluated using the logn - logs curves of @xcite .",
    "the soft band was used for the soft sources and the hard band for the hard sources .",
    "we fit down to the completeness limit ( 3.9@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 ) for soft sources .",
    "it is impossible to fit a single power law from the completeness limit to the highest luminosity source for the hard sources .",
    "we therefore fit a single power law above 3@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "figures [ soft_xlf ] and [ hard_xlf ] show the composite xlf   and best fit power law ( black curves ) for soft and hard sources . also shown",
    "is the slope representing the background source distribution ( red curve ) and the background subtracted data and best fit ( blue curve ) .",
    "best fit parameters to the composite xlf   are shown in table  [ tb : fits ] .",
    "there are two basic conclusions to be drawn from the results presented in the previous section .",
    "the first is that although the completeness limit for a given observation depends on many factors , such as diffuse emission , it is lower for soft sources than for hard sources .",
    "the second is that there appears to be a break in the hard source xlf  at about @xmath233@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the flattening of the hard source xlf  shown in figure  [ hard_xlf ] at low luminosities ( @xmath57@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 ) is largely due to incompleteness .",
    "in @xcite we suggest that the hard sources are dominated by low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the xlf  of sources in elliptical galaxies , which are almost exclusively lmxb has been studied in depth by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the xlf  of a sample of 14 elliptical galaxies ( corrected for incompleteness ) can be fit with a single power law , @xmath4=1.9 over the range 2@xmath24 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "although not formally required , a broken power law gives a better fit ( @xmath25=1.8@xmath260.2 , @xmath27=2.8@xmath260.6 ) with a break luminosity l@xmath28=5@xmath29 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "our fits to the hard sources show very similar features : an xlf  which steepens at a few @xmath29 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "our fit parameters are consistent with those of @xcite , albeit with large uncertainties due to a smaller sample .",
    "it is likely that we are sampling the same population as @xcite .      in @xcite",
    "we suggested that many of the soft sources are thermal supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "we stress here that most of the soft sources considered in @xcite have luminosities @xmath301.0@xmath21 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "they are below the completeness limit for the composite xlf  derived here .",
    "the soft sources at the high luminosity end of the xlf   are almost certainly dominated by accretion powered sources .",
    "the association of soft sources with star formation strongly suggests that the donor stars are young supergiant , o or b stars , even though the soft colors of these binaries is very different from the hard spectra of wind - accretion sources described in section [ intro ] .",
    "we therefore compare the xlf  of soft sources to that of hmxb .",
    "the nature of the soft sources is discussed further in section  [ sec : soft ]    the xlf  of high mass binaries in star forming galaxies has been studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "they find that the hmxb  xlf  is well described by a single power law ( @xmath31 ) over the luminosity range @xmath32 ergs s@xmath2 .",
    "the slope derived by @xcite is very close to our best fit single power law for soft sources ( @xmath33 ) , suggesting that we are sampling the same population .",
    "as discussed above , the luminous soft sources discussed here are most likely hmxb .",
    "however , they are clearly more luminous and have much softer spectra than wind - fed hmxb  ( binary pulsars ) found in the milky way and local group galaxies .",
    "the higher luminosities suggest that the soft sources are accreting material at a higher rate than is found in wind - fed hmxb .",
    "this requirement , plus the softer spectra , suggests that the accretion mechanism is fundamentally different than galactic hmxb . in this section",
    "we discuss the nature of these sources in more detail .",
    "the association of the soft sources with star formation is clearly demonstrated in the case of ngc 4736 ( m94 ) .",
    "this galaxy has a circumnuclear ring of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fg : n4736 ] shows the h@xmath34 image of this galaxy , with the positions of soft ( green ) and hard ( blue ) x - ray sources .",
    "it is clear that the soft sources are found primarily in the star forming ring .",
    "given the association with star formation , these sources are most plausibly neutron star or black hole x - ray binaries with young stellar companions . the x - ray spectral states of black hole x - ray binaries have been described in detail by @xcite . in the low accretion state",
    "the x - ray emission is dominated by a hot corona .",
    "as the accretion rate increases the x - ray flux comes primarily from a disk and is thermal in origin .",
    "the emission is characterized by a disk - blackbody spectrum ( kt@xmath231 kev ) with some contribution at higher energies from a power law component . in the highest accretion state ( steep power law , or spl )",
    "the x - ray emission is characterized by a soft power law ( @xmath352.5 ) .",
    "figure  [ xcols_bh ] shows the x - ray color - color diagram from [ prestwich2003 ] for all detected sources , with thermal and spl models plotted for reference .",
    "the red curve shows the colors of disk - blackbody models for inner disk temperatures of 0.1 - 1.1 kev .",
    "adding a power law component to a disk - blackbody has the effect of moving the colors up and to the left of the diagram , as demonstrated by the green points .",
    "the purple points show a simple power law , representing the spl state .",
    "figure  [ xcols_bh ] shows that some of the soft sources have colors that are very similar to black holes accreting in the thermal or spl state .",
    "however , some of the softest have disk temperatures that are much cooler ( kt@xmath230.1 - 0.3 kev ) than is typically found in galactic black hole binaries ( kt@xmath231 kev ) .",
    "low disk temperatures have also been observed in ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulx ) . since @xmath36",
    ", such low disk temperatures have been used to suggest that ulx contain intermediate mass black holes ( imbh , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it seems very unlikely that we observing a population of imbh .",
    "if the mass of the black holes are @xmath37 @xmath38 , the low luminosities ( @xmath39 ergs s@xmath2 ) would imply sub - eddington accretion rates . in which case , we would not expect to see thermal emission , which is generally observed when the accretion is dominated by a disk and the rates are close to eddington . the combination soft spectrum and low luminosity displayed by a subset of our soft sources is hard to explain if the sources are imbh . if they are stellar mass black holes , their disk temperatures are unusually low .",
    "@xcite recently discussed a state transition in a ulx in ngc 4631 . in the high state ngc 4631",
    "is a super - soft source . in a low state observed by _",
    "chandra _",
    "it has a luminosity @xmath40 ergs s@xmath2 and colors consistent with a thermal temperature of 0.1 - 0.3 kev .",
    "they interpret the ulx / super - soft phase of ngc 4631 as a super - eddingon outburst powered by nuclear burning on the surface of a white dwarf . in it",
    "s low state , the ngc 4631 ulx is very similar to the soft sources described here . by extension",
    ", some soft sources in spiral galaxies may be quiescent super - soft ulx . a detailed study of the variability properties of these sources is required to better understand their nature .",
    "in this paper , we construct color segregated x - ray luminosity functions ( xlf ) of hard and soft sources by combining data from a sample of face - on spiral galaxies . since the number of sources in any given galaxy is small , we coadded sources from a sample of nearby , face - on spiral galaxies . to determine the compleness level of each galaxy as a function of source type ( hard or soft ) we add `` fake '' sources to real galaxy data and determine the ratio of fake sources added to the number recovered by source detection routines .",
    "if all fake sources were detected the galaxy is 100% at that flux level .",
    "we added sources to the lowest luminosity bins to produce composite color segregated xlf  that are complete down to 3.9@xmath21 erg s@xmath2  for soft sources and 7.5@xmath21 erg s@xmath2  for hard sources .",
    "the composite hard source xlf   is best fit by a broken power law and has a high luminosity slope consistent with that found for sources in elliptical galaxies by @xcite .",
    "we conclude the hard population is dominated by lmxb .",
    "the soft xlf   above the completeness limit is very similar to the `` universal '' hmxb  xlf   described by @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that although thermal supernova remnants contribute to the soft population at lower luminosities , the high luminosity end of the xlf  is dominated by accretion - powered hmxb .",
    "the association of soft sources with star formation is confirmed by looking in detail at ngc 4736 , where the soft sources are coincident with a ring of h@xmath34 emission",
    ". some of these sources are stellar - mass black hole binaries accreting in the thermal / pl states .",
    "however , the softest sources have inferred disk temperatures that are considerably lower than those found in galactic black holes binaries . these sources are not well understood , but some may be super - soft ultra - luminous x - ray sources in a quiescent state as suggested by @xcite .",
