    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) is a weak distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum introduced as cmb photons propagate through foreground galaxy clusters @xcite . because this signal does not suffer cosmological dimming and is expected to closely track cluster mass , the sze is a potentially powerful tool for producing large , mass - limited galaxy cluster samples that can be used to constrain dark energy , under the proviso that the relationship between cluster mass and the observed signal is well calibrated @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the sze observable , the integrated compton @xmath1-parameter , @xmath2 , and cluster mass is difficult to calibrate because of the difficulty of measuring mass directly . to date all examinations of the mass-@xmath2 relationship have assumed hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) when converting sze or x - ray measurements of the intracluster gas into estimates of the total mass (; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these methods measure scaling relations between closely related quantities derived from the same data ; deviations in one parameter will therefore inevitably be correlated with the other , and the true intrinsic scatter will likely be underestimated .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and observations @xcite suggest that the hse assumption is incorrect ; non - thermal sources of pressure support may bias  or increase the scatter with @xmath2 .",
    "the scatter in mass at fixed @xmath2 is an important quantity to determine in preparation for the sze cluster surveys designed to constrain the dark energy equation of state , as scatter in the mass - observable relation is generally degenerate with the cosmological parameters of interest ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these surveys will rely on self - calibration techniques to build cluster mass functions from sze - selected cluster catalogs , however these techniques can be rendered ineffective if the scatter is much larger than the few percent predicted by simulations @xcite . at present",
    "there are only weak observational limits , but independent measurements of the mass-@xmath2 scatter can be used to refine the self - calibration @xcite .    the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ; g. p. smith et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) is a morphologically unbiased survey of x - ray luminous galaxy clusters in a narrow redshift range ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the survey unites a variety of probes of total mass , intracluster gas , and cluster member galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main goals of the survey is to measure the shape , normalization and scatter of cluster mass - observable relations as an input to cosmological cluster studies .",
    "here we use a pilot sample of clusters , assembled from , @xcite , and early locuss observations with the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ) , to compare the sze signal with cluster masses derived from gravitational lensing ( ) and thus to construct the first mass-@xmath2 relation that is independent of the assumption of hse .",

    "we seek to measure the slope and normalization of the scaling relation , as well as the intrinsic scatter between these parameters , and therefore follow the prescription of @xcite for linear regression in the presence of intrinsic scatter .",
    "this bayesian method includes the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath1-coordinate ( @xmath21 ) as a parameter of the fit and maximizes the probability of the model ( @xmath22 , @xmath13 , @xmath21 ) given the data and errors .",

    "we now compare the intrinsic scatter in the @xmath3  relation with that in @xmath3@xmath4 from .",

    "we find a scatter in mass of @xmath34% , which is 28% larger ( 1.5@xmath35 significance ) than @xmath36 . indeed , both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are large compared to the scatter predicted from numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , likely due to a combination of modeling uncertainties , astrophysical processes in cluster cores , and projection effects .",
    "the effects of modeling uncertainties are hard to quantify but should not be ignored , as both  and  are derived from parameterized models . to the extent",
    "that these models inadequately represent the cluster or underestimate the uncertainty in the derived parameters , our inferred scatter will be artificially increased .",
    "thus our measured @xmath36 is an upper limit to the true scatter between mass and @xmath2 in cluster cores .    in general , cluster mass measurements based on gravitational lensing and sze observations",
    "are more susceptible to projection effects than those based on x - ray data because the density - squared dependence of the x - ray emissivity limits contributions from material along the line of sight .",
    "nevertheless , simulations @xcite suggest that the contribution to the sze signal from projection is unimportant for clusters with @xmath38 , with the projection effects diminishing further at the small radii used here .",
    "gravitational lensing is sensitive to all mass along the line of sight through the cluster , which will likely increase the scatter in our scaling relation , however the contribution of correlated large - scale structure to lensing - based mass measurements should decrease at smaller radii in a manner similar to the impact on the sze signal .",
    "we also emphasize that our sample is x - ray selected with no consideration paid to the presence / absence of strong lensing arcs , so it should not suffer the halo orientation bias that boosts the core mass in strong - lensing - selected samples ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . indeed ,",
    "5/14 clusters contain no obvious strong - lensing signal .",
    "projection - induced scatter therefore appears insignificant for  and may be somewhat more important for , although this affects both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    given that the mass measurement methods and 9/14 of the clusters are identical between this letter and , we expect the difference between the scatter in these two relations to be dominated by the relative sensitivity of @xmath2 and @xmath4 to the gas physics of cluster cores",
    ". the intracluster medium ( icm ) in cluster cores is often disturbed by active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and cluster - cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "for this reason , cluster cores are often excluded when deriving x - ray observables for use as mass proxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore ascribe the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 to the difference in the sze and x - ray emissivity dependencies on icm density and temperature .",
    "the sze is unaffected by isobaric disturbances ( excluding relativistic components such as cosmic rays ) , while the energy - integrated x - ray emissivity varies approximately as the square of the density , which may be significantly perturbed in the core .",
    "@xcite found potentially important changes in the sze and x - ray signals from cool cores in simulations incorporating cosmic rays , but the effect and therefore the induced scatter was found to be larger for x - ray emission . in larger measurement apertures , such as the frequently used  and  ( 350  kpc corresponds to @xmath30=4000@xmath38000 for our sample ) , core - removed x - ray mass proxies are found to correlate more tightly with mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we expect that @xmath36 will also decrease when measured on these scales",
    ".      found that the normalization of the @xmath31 relation for disturbed clusters was @xmath39 hotter than for undisturbed clusters at @xmath40 ( after excising the central region of the x - ray data ) .",
    "we re - fit the -  relation to the undisturbed and disturbed sub - samples ( table  [ t : cls ] ) finding no significant difference in normalization between undisturbed and disturbed clusters ( @xmath41 , @xmath13 fixed to 0.5 ) .",
    "again , this suggests that the integrated sze signal , even in cluster cores , is less sensitive to the icm physics than the x - ray temperature , although the significance of this result is low given the small samples used here and in .",
    "as discussed in sections [ s : intro ] and [ s : intsc ] , the icm may be far from hse ; we search for this effect in our data by combining our results with those of @xcite who studied the -  relation .",
    "our lensing measurements are sensitive to the projected mass ( @xmath42 ) ; we therefore convert them to the spherical masses ( @xmath43 ) required for comparison with the hydrostatic analysis .",
    "we do this by assuming that the halo mass distributions are described by the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite , which is specified by mass and concentration , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; given  and @xmath45 we can than derive an approximate conversion factor @xmath46 at 350  kpc .",
    "this conversion factor depends sensitively on @xmath45 , but there is considerable theoretical uncertainty about the mean value and scatter in concentration at fixed mass , and its variation with redshift and cluster mass . without direct measurements of @xmath45 for most of our clusters we marginalize over the range of values observed by @xcite for 19 clusters from the locuss sample , which have very similar masses and redshifts to our sample .",
    "we randomly choose a concentration from the 19 in @xcite for each of our clusters , calculate the corresponding value of = @xmath47 , and fit a scaling relation between the estimated  and .",
    "we repeat this process thousands of times , and derive a mean normalization of the @xmath3@xmath2 relation of @xmath48 for @xmath20 .",
    "this value can be directly compared to the normalization of the @xmath3@xmath2 relation from @xcite : @xmath49 .",
    "the statistically insignificant difference between these values implies a mass ratio of /=@xmath5 .",
    "using hydrostatic masses from x - ray observations and weak lensing masses from the literature , @xcite and @xcite estimate the weak lensing to hydrostatic mass ratio to be @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , measured at .",
    "@xcite , however , demonstrate a radial trend in this ratio between  and , suggestive of a 20% deficit in hydrostatic masses at  that can not be accounted for by the projection of unrelated structures along the line of sight .",
    "our result , interior to the innermost radius examined by @xcite , is consistent with their non - detection of a bias in the hydrostatic mass at small radii .",
    "the precision of our measurement is limited by the intrinsic scatter in our relation , with a smaller contribution coming from the unknown halo concentration values required to convert between  and .",
    "future combinations of weak and strong lensing measurements , specifically joint strong@xmath52weak lens modeling of the clusters combining the _ subaru _ and _ hst _ data ( g. p. smith et al . 2009 , in preparation ) should allow us to evaluate the bias as a function of radius .",
    "we have presented the first calibration of the mass-@xmath2 relation based on gravitational - lensing measurements of cluster mass , based largely on previously published sze data and gravitational lens models .",
    "we construct the relation at a fixed physical radius of 350kpc to minimize uncertainties arising from extrapolation of cluster models based on both datasets .",
    "in contrast to the mass-@xmath4 relation within the same aperture , we succeed in fitting a model with both free slope and normalization .",
    "the best - fit slope is consistent with the self - similar prediction , and the intrinsic scatter in mass at fixed @xmath2 is 32% , in contrast to the 41% scatter in mass at fixed @xmath4 .",
    "we also fit the relation to sub - samples of disturbed and undisturbed cluster cores but find that the best - fit normalizations for these sub - samples are consistent within the errors . finally , we combine our results with those of @xcite to test whether the cluster cores are in hse .",
    "cluster core masses estimated from lensing and sze data ( assuming hse ) are , on average , consistent within the errors , suggesting that departures from equilibrium are modest in cluster cores .",
    "we conclude that the difference between the mass-@xmath2 and mass-@xmath4 relations is mainly attributable to the relative insensitivity of the sz effect to the physics of the icm in cluster cores .",
