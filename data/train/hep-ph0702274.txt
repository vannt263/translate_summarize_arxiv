    "the gravitino is the most important prediction of supergravity ( sugra ) @xcite .",
    "its mass is expected to be in a wide range , @xmath11 ev@xmath12 tev , depending on the mediation mechanism of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking effects . in particular , the gravitino with a mass of @xmath13 mev@xmath14 gev is very interesting in the sense that it is most likely the stable and lightest susy particle ( lsp ) and can be a candidate of cold dark matter in the universe . moreover ,",
    "if the gravitino mass lies between a few gev and a few 10 s gev and the next lsp ( nlsp ) is a charged scalar lepton ( @xmath0 ) such as stau ( @xmath15 ) , the sugra can be tested in high - energy collider experiments @xcite .",
    "the key observation is that the gravitino mass @xmath16 , the stau mass @xmath17 and the stau lifetime @xmath18 could be measured in high precision if @xmath16 is of @xmath19 gev ( cf .",
    "then the planck scale @xmath20 is extracted through the relation , @xmath21 .",
    "this independent determination of @xmath20 will provide us with a crucial test of the sugra .    for the gravitino mass in such an interesting region",
    "as discussed above , the stau has necessarily a long lifetime .",
    "for example , it is of order one month for @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev .",
    "however , such a long - lived particle is potentially dangerous in cosmology .",
    "if it decays after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , the decay products destroy the light elements and ruin the success of the sbbn ( standard bbn ) @xcite .",
    "more seriously , if the long - lived particle is negatively charged as @xmath1 , it forms bound states together with positively charged nuclei , which leads to an enhancement of some nuclear reaction rates .",
    "that is , @xmath1 plays as a catalyzer of nuclear fusion ( catalyzed bbn or cbbn in short ) and affects cosmological nuclear abundances . produced in accelerators",
    "may be of practical use as a catalyzer for d - d and d - t fusions similar to the muon catalyzed fusion @xcite . ]    in a recent article @xcite , pospelov has argued that too much @xmath4 is produced through the cbbn if the lifetime of @xmath1 is long enough , @xmath24 sec , and its abundance is large enough , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the number density of @xmath1 and the entropy density of the universe , respectively .",

    "the production rate of @xmath4 estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a naive comparison of the standard process @xmath28 and the new catalyzed process @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the 1s coulomb bound state of @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is assumed that the standard process is dominated by the e2 transition induced by the interaction @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the quadrapole operator .",
    "then , by applying the same interaction to the photonless process with @xmath33 replaced by the coulomb field associated with @xmath1 , it was concluded that the astrophysical @xmath8-factor of the new process at zero incident energy is about 0.3 mev barn .",
    "however , the assumptions adopted in the above estimate do not have firm ground : for example , the angular momentum of the initial @xmath6-@xmath7 system in the catalyzed process is dominated by zero , @xmath34 , while the angular momentum of the initial system in the standard process is dominated by @xmath35 @xmath36 for the e2 ( e1 ) transition .",
    "such a kinematical difference invalidates the use of the sbbn process to estimate the cbbn process .",
    "furthermore , the quantum interplay between the @xmath37 nuclear fusion and the tunneling of @xmath7 through the coulomb barrier plays an important role in low - energy catalyzed fusion and can not be treated in a perturbative manner .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to solve the shrdinger equation for the three - body system ( @xmath38 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 ) exactly and derive a reliable @xmath8-factor for the @xmath1 cbbn .",
    "the method we adopt is the state - of - the - art coupled - channel technique developed by two of the present authors ( m.k . and y.k .",
    ") together with e. hiyama @xcite . since we can treat the catalyzed process directly , we do not need to refer to any of the sbbn processes .",
    "also , the method has been already proven to be highly accurate and useful in atomic and nuclear physics ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the obtained astrophysical @xmath8-factor at @xmath39 kev ( the position of the gamow peak for @xmath9 kev which is relevant to the cbbn ) is 0.038 mev  barn .",
    "this is about 10 times smaller than the estimate in ref .",

    ", our @xmath8-factor leads to the @xmath40 abundance from cbbn as @xmath41/10^{-16})$ ] .",
    "therefore , an observational upper bound on the @xmath40 abundance @xmath42 ( @xmath43 )  @xcite leads to a bound on the @xmath1 abundance , @xmath44 .",
    "this requires a dilution of the relic stau by some entropy production at late time by a factor of @xmath45 .",
    "such a dilution factor can easily be consistent with the thermal leptogenesis  @xcite for a reheating temperature @xmath46 gev .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii , we summarize the basic reaction of the @xmath1 catalyzed fusion as well as its atomic analogue , the muon transfer reaction . in sec.iii , we present our method of solving the @xmath6-@xmath7-x@xmath47 three - body problem . in sec.iv , we show our result of astrophysical @xmath8-factor as a function of the incident energy .",
    "sec.v is devoted to conclusion and discussions in which the @xmath4 abundance in cbbn and its implication to particle physics are also mentioned .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , we will treat the following process directly in a fully quantum mechanical manner : @xmath48 as shown later in section v , the relevant temperature @xmath49 for cbbn is about 10 kev .",
    "this corresponds to the gamow peak of the incident channel located at the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath5036.4 kev with the full @xmath51 width of 44 kev .",
    "thus the c.m .",
    "energy of the incident channel will be typically up to @xmath52 kev .",
    "we adopt the @xmath37 cluster model in which the @xmath53li nucleus is a bound state of a @xmath54he nucleus and a deuteron .",
    "this model has extensively been utilized in the studies of the structure and reactions of light nuclei and is very well established ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a cluster - model treatment allows us to investigate the reaction ( [ eq : transfer ] ) as a quantum three - body problem , @xmath55 .",
    "the rearrangement of the three ingredients takes place during the reaction process through the long range coulomb interaction and the short range nuclear interaction .",
    "although solving the three - body problem accurately is quite an elaborate task , two of the authors ( m.k . and y.k .",
    ") have an experience @xcite to have solved a similar subject , the muon transfer reaction , @xmath56 at incident energies of @xmath57 ev in the context of the muon catalyzed d - t fusion cycle @xcite . among the calculations of this reaction in the literatures ,",
    "their three - body coupled - channel method was found to provide with the most accurate result ( see @xmath588 of @xcite ) .    in the present paper , the same coupled - channel method",
    "is applied to the reaction , eq .",
    "( [ eq : transfer ] ) .",
    "we note here that it is very important to employ an appropriate nuclear interaction between @xmath54he and deuteron in treating the reaction ; we choose the interaction which can reproduce the binding energy and the charge form - factor of @xmath53li as well as the low - energy @xmath37 scattering phase shift .",
    "following ref.@xcite , we briefly explain the three - body coupled - channel method to investigate the reaction ( [ eq : transfer ] ) . as shown in fig.[fig : stau_fig1 ] , we consider all the jacobi coordinates @xmath59 of the three possible sets , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the entrance channel @xmath62 and the exit channel @xmath63 in our reaction are best described by the coordinates for @xmath64 and those for @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "since we are interested in the incident energy of the entrance channel below 100 kev , there is no other open channel than the above two .",
    "all the excited states of @xmath30 and @xmath53li as well as all the states of @xmath66 can be excited only virtually in the intermediate stage of the reaction . to describe such an intermediate state where particle - rearrangement takes place , it is convenient to utilize the coordinates for @xmath67 together with those for @xmath60 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the total wave function @xmath68 of the @xmath55 system having an angular momentum @xmath69 and its @xmath70-component @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 with the hamiltonian , @xmath73 as far as we use the reduced masses ( @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) associated with the coordinates ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , every choice of @xmath78 in the kinetic term is equivalent .",

    "for example , the third term describes such an effect that the incoming deuteron attracts the @xmath54he in the 1s - orbit around @xmath1 and distorts the orbit before picking up the @xmath54he .",
