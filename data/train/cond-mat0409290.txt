    "phase diagrams under five similar hard - core sutherland potentials are illustrated .    in section 3 of this paper , we conclude that there is no proper similar hard - core sutherland potential which can bring completely right interpretation to the balanced liquid - gas coexistence phenomenon by the theory in this paper .",
    "we find that a similar sutherland potential with its exponent @xmath8 leads to more accurate forecast not only to the critical coefficient of argon but also to the phase diagram and the relation of pressure versus temperature .",

    "here we do think the two phases are described by the same canonical partition function as eq.(12 ) .",
    "there are three balanced conditions which must be satisfied when these two phases are balanced .",

    "fig.(4 ) is the curve of @xmath150 versus @xmath151 . in ref.[4",
    "] , we have introduced one method called polynomial approximation to simulate the relation of two variables .",
    "here we can get the relation of @xmath150 versus @xmath152 by this method when @xmath153 is fixed . in ref.[5 ] , the theoretic relation of @xmath150 versus @xmath151 was given by this method in the case of @xmath78 .    in 1945 , e.a.guggenheim collected the data of the balanced liquid - gas coexistence system from experiments and gave out the correlation of @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath89 by the empirical equations[5,6 ] below@xmath156@xmath157for that@xmath158@xmath159we have@xmath160@xmath161 in eq.(51 - 52 ) , @xmath162 is the reduced density of the gases and @xmath163 is the reduced density of the liquids .",
    "as far as argon system is concerned , the inaccuracy of these two equations is generally only one or two parts per thousand of @xmath155 or of @xmath164 when @xmath165[5,6 ] .",
    "so , it is acceptable to consider the data of @xmath166 from eq.(55 - 56 ) as the experimental ones in this temperature region[5 ] .",
    "e.a.guggenheim gave a numerical analytic result of the relation between the reduced temperature and the reduced pressure from experiments by equation[5,7]@xmath167which best fits the experimental data for argon when @xmath165 except a tiny region near the critical point[5,7 ] .",
    "thus it is acceptable to consider the data of @xmath168 from eq.(57 ) as the experimental ones , too[5 ] . the data from eq.(55 - 57 )",
    "are illustrated as experimental data in fig.(2 - 4 ) and table.(2 ) to compare with the theoretic ones deduced above .",
    "in this paper we advanced five hypothesis to deal with the total potential energy of a balanced canonical system .",
    "hypothesis 1 - 4 are easy to be accepted .",
    "the key is hypothesis 5 .",
    "actually @xmath34 , @xmath35 is a simple approximation to a concrete sytem . in labs ,",
    "the volume of the sytem we consider is finite:@xmath169 additionally , only when we consider a static sytem in 3 dimensional space , can the average volume of a particle be regarded as a sphere . and",
    "@xmath14 is effective .",
    "@xmath34 is only a simple effective approximation .    on the basis of the five hypothesis",
    ", we got the canonical partition function eq.(12 ) .",
    "thus all the thermodynamic quantities will be solved by eq.(12 ) .",
    "following , we analyzed the balanced liquid - gas coexistence canonical argon - like system .",
    "the results are partly illustrated in figures and tables .",
    "fig.(3 - 4 ) indicates that @xmath144 in the region ( 0,1 ) leads to more perfect forecast to experimental data .",
    "applying numerical calculation by computer , we find @xmath170 is the best among the five values of @xmath144 chosen in this paper only when phase diagram and the relation of @xmath150 versus @xmath152 are considered together .",
    "it is clearly illustrated in figure.(3 - 4 ) .",
    "then the similar hard - core sutherland potential is fixed to be the form of@xmath171 in this case , the equation of state is @xmath172now the critical coefficient @xmath116 is equal to @xmath173 . but @xmath170 is not the best when the relation of @xmath90 versus @xmath145 is considered .",
    "figure.(2 ) suggests that @xmath174 and @xmath175 are better .",
    "now we will ask whether a proper @xmath144 , which can bring completely right forecast to experiments when the liquid - gas coexistence phenomenon is considered , exisits or not by the theory in this paper .",
    "suppose that such a @xmath176 exists .",
    "thus eq.(50 ) will be right when arbitrary two experimental data terms @xmath177 are considered . from eq.(55 - 56 )",
    ", we get two experimental data terms:@xmath178 , latexmath:[$\\left ( 0.3928,1.6822\\right )    value of @xmath144 by matlab software .",
    "the result is @xmath180 thus we conclude such a proper @xmath144 does not exist .",
    "but it does not mean that there exists no value for @xmath144 corresponding with the potential explaining the experimental data properly .",
    "a new theory may be do .",
    "actually , when the liquid - gas phase transiton to second order is considered , our work does not work well for the obvious fluctuation near to the critical point , which is ommitted in hypothesis ( 4 ) .",
    "we will discuss it in details in future work .",
    "of course , we see that this work offered the proper critical coefficient @xmath181 of argon by a simple equation of state with @xmath182 .",
