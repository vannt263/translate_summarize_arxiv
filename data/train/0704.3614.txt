    "clusters can be identified by their galaxy content @xcite , their thermal x - ray emission @xcite , the sunyaev - zeldovich decrement they produce in the microwave background signal @xcite , or the weak lensing signature they produce in the shapes of distant background galaxies @xcite .",
    "each of these identification methods also produces proxies for mass : e.g , the number of galaxies , total stellar luminosity , galaxy velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity and temperature , or sz and weak lensing profiles .",
    "simulations of the formation and evolution of large - scale structure through gravitational collapse provide us with rich predictions for the expected matter distribution within a given cosmology @xcite .",
    "these predictions include not only first - order features , like the halo mass function n(m , z ) , but higher - order correlations as well , like the precise way in which galaxy clusters are themselves clustered as a function of mass .",
    "comparisons of these theoretical predictions to the observed universe provide an excellent opportunity to test our understanding of cosmology and the formation of large - scale structure . the weak point in this chain",
    "is that simulations most reliably predict the dark matter distribution , while observations are most directly sensitive to luminous galaxies and gas .",

    ", we must understand the scatter in the mass  observable relations as well .",

    "the primary goal of this work is to develop a method to estimate both the mean and scatter in the cluster velocity - dispersion  richness relation .",

    "the method developed is applied to the sdss maxbcg cluster catalog- a photometrically selected catalog with extensive spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "these methods are tested extensively with both the c4 catalog @xcite , a smaller spectroscopically - selected sample of clusters , and new mock catalogs generated by combining n - body simulations with a prescription for galaxy population ( wechsler et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "ultimately , we aim to connect richness to mass through measurements of velocity dispersion .",
    "while the link between dark matter velocity dispersion and mass is known from n - body simulations to have very small scatter @xcite , the relationship between galaxy and dark matter velocity dispersion ( the velocity bias ) remains uncertain and will require additional study .",
    "constraints on the normalization and scatter of the total mass - richness relation obtained by this method are thus limited by uncertainty in the velocity bias .",

    "degrees of available sdss imaging data , and from the mock catalogs described below , using the maxbcg method @xcite which is outlined in  [ sec : maxbcg ] .    the spectroscopic survey targets a `` main '' sample of galaxies with @xmath9@xmath1217.8 and a median redshift of z@xmath140.1 @xcite and a `` luminous red galaxy '' sample @xcite which is roughly volume limited out to z=0.38 , but further extends to z=0.6 .",
    "the `` main '' sample composes about 90% of the catalog , with the `` luminous red galaxy '' sample making up the rest .",

    ", these catalogs must reproduce these aspects of the sdss data in some detail .",
    "in this work , we use mock catalogs created by the addgals ( adding density - determined galaxies to lightcone simulations ) method ( described by wechsler et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) which is specifically designed for this purpose .",
    "these catalogs populate a dark matter light - cone simulation with galaxies using an observationally - motivated biasing scheme .",
    "galaxies are inserted in these simulations at the locations of individual dark matter particles , subject to several empirical constraints .",
    "the relation between dark matter particles of a given over - density ( on a mass scale of @xmath15 ) is connected to the two point correlation function of these particles .",
    "this connection is used to assign subsets of particles to galaxies using a probability distribution @xmath16 , chosen to reproduce the luminosity - dependent correlation function of galaxies as measured in the sdss by @xcite .",
    "the number of galaxies of a given brightness placed within the simulations is determined from the measured sdss @xmath9-band galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "we consider galaxies brighter than 0.4 l@xmath17 , because it is these galaxies that are counted in the maxbcg richness estimate .",
    "finally , colors are assigned to each galaxy by measuring their local galaxy density in redshift space , and assigning to them the colors of a real sdss galaxy with similar luminosity and local density ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "this method produces mock galaxy catalogs whose galaxies reproduce several properties of the observed sdss galaxies . in particular , they follow the empirical galaxy color  density relation and its evolution , a property of fundamental importance for ridgeline - based cluster detection methods .",
    "the process accounts for @xmath18-corrections between rest and observed frame colors and assigns realistic photometric errors .",
    "each mock galaxy is associated with a dark matter particle and adopts its 3d motion .",
    "this is important , as it encodes in the motions of the mock galaxies the full dynamical richness of the n - body simulation .",
    "galaxies may occupy fully virialized regions , be descending into clusters for the first time , or be slowly streaming along nearby filaments .",
    "this complete sampling of the velocity field around fully realized n - body halos is essential , as these mock catalogs allow us to predict directly the velocity structure we ought to observe in the data .",
    "note that this simulation process , by design , assumes no velocity bias between the dark matter and the luminous galaxies , except for the bcg , which is made by artificially placing the brightest galaxy assigned to a given halo at its dynamic center .    in this work ,",
    "we use two mock catalogs based on different simulations .",
    "the first is based on the hubble volume simulation ( the ms lightcone of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has a particle mass of @xmath19m@xmath20 while the second is based on a simulation run at los alamos national laboratory ( lanl ) using the hashed - oct - tree code @xcite .",
    "this simulation tracks the evolution of @xmath21 particles with @xmath22m@xmath20  in a box of side length 768 mpc h@xmath1 , and is referred to as the `` higher resolution '' simulation in what follows .",
    "both simulations have cosmological parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to the galaxy list we have a list of dark matter halos , defined using a spherical over - density cluster finder ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by running the cluster finding algorithm on the mock catalogs , we connect clusters detected `` observationally '' from their galaxy content with simulated dark matter halos in a direct way .      given that there is still substantial uncertainty in the amount of velocity bias for various galaxy samples",
    ", we must be careful to avoid velocity bias dependent conclusions .",
    "the mock catalogs with which we are comparing do not explicitly include velocity bias .",
    "fortunately , we will only incur errors due to velocity bias when we estimate masses or directly compare velocity dispersions measured in the mock catalogs to those measured in the data .",
    "therefore in most of our analysis , velocity bias has no effect . where it is relevant",
    ", we choose to leave velocity bias as a free parameter because of its current observational and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "observational uncertainties in velocity bias arise simply because it is exceedingly difficult to measure .",
    "to make such a measurement , one usually requires two independent determinations of mass , one of them based on dynamical measurements , each subject to systematic and random errors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another technique was recently used by @xcite , namely constraining the velocity bias by measuring the virial mass function and comparing it to other independent cosmological constraints .",
    "their analysis resulted in a bias of @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately , this technique folds in systematic errors from the other analyses .    in the past",
    ", theoretical predictions of velocity bias were affected by numerical over - merging and low resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most estimates of velocity bias based on high - resolution n - body simulations have given @xmath28 @xcite , partially depending on the mass regime studied .",
    "recent theoretical work has shown that differing methods of subhalo selection in n - body simulations change the derived velocity bias .",
    "in particular , @xcite have shown that when subhalos are selected by their properties at the time of accretion onto their hosts ( a model which also matches the two - point clustering better , see @xcite ) , they are consistent with being unbiased with respect to the dark matter .",
    "still , understanding velocity bias with confidence will require more observational and theoretical study . as a result ,",
    "we leave velocity bias as a free parameter where assumptions are required .",
    "the maxbcg cluster detection algorithm identifies clusters as significant over - densities in position - color space @xcite .",
    "it relies on the fact that massive clusters are dominated by bright , red , passively - evolving ellipticals , known as the red - sequence @xcite .",
    "in addition , it exploits the spatial clustering of red - sequence and the presence of a cd - like brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "the brightest of the red - sequence galaxies form a color  magnitude relation , the e / s0 ridgeline @xcite , whose color is a strong function of redshift .",
    "thus , in addition to reliably detecting clusters , maxbcg also returns accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "the details of the algorithm can be found in @xcite .",

    "0.02 in redshift , and within 1 @xmath33mpc .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is defined by @xcite as the radius at which the galaxy number density of the cluster is 200@xmath34 times the mean galaxy space density .",
    "this radius may not be physically equivalent to the standard r@xmath35  defined as the radius in which the total matter density of the cluster is 200 times the critical density .    in the work",

    "these mass profiles are fit with a one- and two - halo term . the best fit nfw profile @xcite , which comprises the one - halo term , is used to measure r200 .",
    "several systematic errors are accounted for including non - linear shear , cluster mis - centering , and the contribution of the bcg light ( modeled as a point mass ) .",
    "it is notable that the redshift estimates for the maxbcg cluster sample are quite good",
    ". they can be tested with sdss data by comparing them to spectroscopic redshifts for a large number of bcg galaxies obtained as part of the sdss itself .",

    "the selection function has been further characterized for use in cosmological constraints by @xcite .",
    "we finally note that clusters at lower redshift are more easily identified directly from the spectroscopic sample ( e.g. the c4 catalog , @xcite or the catalog of @xcite ) , but are limited in number due to the high flux limit of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "clusters at redshifts higher than 0.3 can be identified easily in sdss photometric data , but measurement of their richnesses , locations , and redshifts _ in a uniform way _ becomes increasingly difficult as their member galaxies become faint .",
    "future studies similar to the one described in this paper will be possible as the maxbcg method is pushed to higher redshift and higher redshift spectroscopy is obtained .",

    ", we extend the range of this catalog to @xmath42 and n@xmath29@xmath43 .",
    "the lower redshift bound allows us to include more of the sdss spectroscopy , which peaks in density around @xmath44 .",

    "the selection function has only been very well characterized ( by @xcite and @xcite ) for the maxbcg catalog presented in @xcite . the broader redshift range and lower richness limit considered for this study are not encompassed in the preceding studies .",
    "this is primarily because we expect the color selection may produce less complete samples for low richness ; since the red fraction in clusters and groups decreases with decreasing mass , maxbcg may be biased against the bluest low mass groups .    requiring sufficient spectroscopic coverage for each cluster , defined in ",

    "we defer a full discussion of the fitting results to  [ sec : nongauss ] where we show how to compute the mean velocity dispersion and scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed n@xmath29  using the results of the 2gauss fitting algorithm , including corrections for improperly selected bcg centers and/or bcg movement .    to ensure that the use of the 2gauss method does not bias our fits in any way , we repeated them using the 1gauss , 3gauss , and 4gauss methods .",
    "we find that while the measured second moment for the 1gauss fits are consistently lower than those measured from the 2gauss fits by approximately 8% , both the second and fourth moments measured by the 2gauss , 3gauss , and 4gauss fits are the same to within a few percent . therefore we conclude that the fits have converged and that two gaussians plus a constant are sufficient to capture the overall shape of the pvd histogram .",
    "the fitting errors are determined using bootstrap resampling over the clusters in each bin .",
    "the results are not dependent on the radial or velocity scale used to construct the bgvcf  and thus the pvd histogram .",
    "we repeated the 2gauss fits using 0.75r@xmath35 , 1.0r@xmath35 , 1.25r@xmath35 , and 1.5r@xmath35projected radial cuts as well as @xmath60 km s@xmath1 , @xmath61 scaled , and @xmath62 scaled apertures in velocity space .",
    "we found no significant differences in the fits using each of the various cuts , with the exception of the value of the background normalization , which will change when a larger aperture allows more background to be included in the pvd histogram .",
    "the scaled apertures were made by first determining the relation in a fixed aperture , and then rescaling the aperture according to this relation .",
    "for example , in a bin of n@xmath29  from 18 to 20 , the velocity dispersion is @xmath63 km s@xmath1as measured in a @xmath647000 km s@xmath1fixed aperture . to make the five sigma scaled aperture measurements",
    ", we used an aperture in this n@xmath29  bin of @xmath65 km s@xmath1 .      to measure the velocity dispersion of individual clusters in the sdss , we select all clusters that have at least ten redshifts in its pvd histogram within three sigma measured by the mean velocity - dispersion  n@xmath29  relation calculated in  [ sec : nongauss ] .",
    "of the 12,253 clusters represented in the bgvcf , only 634 meet the above requirement .",
    "we then apply the bisigma method to calculate the velocity dispersion which uses the biweight estimator @xcite .",
    "the resulting velocity dispersions are plotted in figure [ fig : icvds ] .",
    "the bcg bias manifests itself here in that the icvds show a downward bias with respect to the mean relation calculated in ",
    "[ sec : nongauss ] , but not corrected for bcg bias .",
    "we will correct for this bias in  [ sec : bias ] .",
    "the two relations do however agree to within one- to two - sigma ( computed through jackknife resampling with the biweight ) . using these individual cluster velocity dispersions ( icvds ) , we can directly compute the scatter in the velocity dispersion at fixed n@xmath29 .",
    "we will compare this computation with the estimate based on measuring non - gaussianity in the stacked sample in  [ sec : nongauss ] .",
    "the subject of non - gaussianity of pair - wise velocity difference histograms has been debated extensively in the literature . @xcite",
    "have shown that non - gaussianity in the total pvd histogram for dark matter halos arises from two sources : stacking halos of different masses according to the mass function , and intrinsic non - gaussianity in the pvd histogram due to substructure , secondary infall , and dissipation of orbital kinetic energy into subhalo internal degrees of freedom .",
    "however for galaxy clusters , they conclude that the pvd histogram of an individual galaxy cluster that is virialized is well approximated by a gaussian .",
    "@xcite independently reached the same conclusions but did not consider any intrinsic non - gaussianity , just the effect of stacking halos of different masses according to the mass function .",
    "@xcite gave a more complete synthesis of non - gaussianity in pvd histograms , generalizing the formalism to include the effect of particle tracer type ( halos versus galaxies versus dark matter particles ) and extensively considering the effects of local environment .",
    "in all three treatments , non - gaussianity is shown to arise from the stacking of individual pvd histograms which are gaussian or nearly gaussian and have some intrinsic distribution of widths . in this paper",
    "we use the term `` mass mixing '' to refer only to non - gaussianity arising through this process .",
    "it should be noted that observing non - gaussianity in pvd histograms stacked by richness is equivalent to saying that the richness verses velocity dispersion relation has intrinsic scatter ( assuming that the stacked pvd histogram of set of similar velocity dispersion clusters has intrinsic gaussianity ) .",
    "intrinsic scatter in the velocity - dispersion  richness relation was reported earlier by for a volume - limited sample of 80 literature - selected clusters with at least 10 redshifts each . here",
    "we seek to quantify this scatter as a function of richness by measuring the non - gaussianity in the pvd histogram .    for individual galaxy clusters , theoretical",
    "work has been done by @xcite showing that violent gravitational collapse in an n - body system may lead to a non - gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "however , @xcite have shown that the velocity distribution of subhalos in a dissipationless n - body simulation is gaussian ( maxwellian in three dimensions ) and shows little bias compared to the diffuse dark matter , if the subhalos are selected by their mass when they enter the host halo and not the present - day mass . finally , @xcite caution against concluding that the three - dimensional velocity distribution of a galaxy cluster is maxwellian even if one component is found to be approximately gaussian .",
    "they show that for a slightly non - maxwellian three - dimensional distribution , departures of the one - dimensional distribution from a gaussian are much smaller than departures of the three - dimensional distribution from a maxwellian .",
    "observationally , the pvd histogram of individual galaxy clusters has been shown to be non - gaussian in the presence of substructure .",
    "conversely , @xcite observed 79 galaxy clusters with at least 30 redshifts each and found no systematic deviations from gaussianity ( although 14 were found to be mildly non - gaussian at the three - sigma level ) .",
    "@xcite showed that once recently - accreted galaxies are removed from the sample of redshifts from the fornax cluster , the pvd histogram becomes gaussian .    unfortunately , due to the low number of galaxy redshifts available for a given cluster as shown in ",
    "[ sec : cgcf ] , we must make some assumption about the shape of the pvd histogram for _ a set of stacked clusters of velocity dispersion between @xmath66 and @xmath67 _ in order to proceed with constructing a mass mixing model .",
    "if every cluster were sampled sufficiently , the scatter in velocity dispersion at a given value of n@xmath29  could be directly computed by measuring the velocity dispersions of individual clusters .",
    "since this is not the case , in order to proceed we assume that for _ a set of stacked clusters of velocity dispersion between @xmath66 and @xmath68 _ , the pvd histogram is gaussian .",
    "this assumption is well justified and is equivalent to the assumption that a large enough portion of the clusters in our catalog are sufficiently relaxed , virialized systems at their centers , so that when we stack them , any asymmetries or substructure are averaged out .    however , we will still be sensitive to substructure around the bcg .",
    "in fact , we may even be more sensitive to substructure around the bcg since we are directly stacking clusters on the bcg . using the addgals mock galaxy catalogs",
    ", we find that when binning dark matter halos with galaxies by both velocity dispersion and mass , the resulting stacked pvd histograms are gaussian .",
    "this result gives us further confidence that the above assumption is reasonable , but it is still possible that it is sensitive either to the bcg placement or to the galaxy selection of the mock catalogs .    under the assumption of gaussianity of the pvd histogram for a stacked set of similar velocity dispersion clusters , the non - gaussianity in the stacked histograms can be entirely attributed to the distribution of the velocity dispersions ( or equivalently mass ) of the stacked clusters .",
    "the goal of our analysis is then to extract the distribution of velocity dispersions for a given pvd histogram by measuring its deviation from gaussianity .",
    "we can now proceed in two distinct ways .",
    "first , by writing the pvd histogram as a convolution of a gaussian curve of width @xmath66 for each stacked set of similar velocity dispersion clusters , with some distribution of velocity dispersions in the stack , we could numerically deconvolve this gaussian out of the pvd histogram to produce the distribution of velocity dispersions in the stack . repeating this procedure in various bins on different observables , we could then have knowledge of the scatter in velocity dispersion as a function of these observables .",
    "second , by taking a more model dependent approach , we could make an educated guess of the distribution of @xmath66 as a function of a given set of parameters , and then perform the convolution to predict the shape of the pvd histogram . by matching the predictions with the observations through adjusting the set of parameters",
    ", we could then have a parameterized model of the entire distribution .",
    "based on the results shown below in  [ sec : tests ] , it is apparent that the only parameter upon which @xmath66 varies significantly , neglecting the modest redshift dependence , is n@xmath29 .",
    "thus we choose a parametric model that is a function of n@xmath29  only .",
    "the dependence of mass mixing on any secondary parameters ( e.g. the bcg @xmath10-band luminosity ) can then be explored through first binning on n@xmath29  and then splitting on these secondary parameters , because their effects are small ( see  [ sec : tests ] ) .",
    "the addgals mock catalogs show the scatter about the mean of the logarithm of the velocity dispersion measured from the dark matter for a given value of n@xmath32  to be approximately gaussian for dark matter halos . using this distribution as our educated guess",
    ", we apply this model to the data in logarithmic bins of n@xmath29 .",
    "we avoid the deconvolution due to its inherent numerical difficulty . using the mock catalogs ,",
    "we can test our method of determining the parameters of this model as a function of n@xmath29  by applying our analysis to clusters identified in the mocks and then matching those clusters to halos in order to determine their true velocity dispersions .    to summarize , there are two and possibly even three sources of non - gaussianity in our pvd histograms ( similar to those discussed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite discussed above ) : ( 1 ) intrinsic non - gaussianity in the pvd histogram for an individual galaxy cluster , ( 2 ) the range of velocity dispersions that contribute to the pvd histogram for a given value of n@xmath29  ( mass mixing ) , and ( 3 ) stacking of clusters with different values of n@xmath29  in the same pvd histogram .",
    "we handle the last two sources of non - gaussianity jointly through the model below and ignore the first , which is expected to be small , both because most clusters are relaxed , virialized systems and many are stacked together here .    as a final note , by binning logarithmically in n@xmath29  and then measuring the mass mixing , we only approximately account for non - gaussianity arising from clusters with different richnesses in the same bin . by avoiding binning all together and finding the model parameters through a maximum likelihood approach",
    ", we could remedy this issue .",
    "this approach is the baymix method .",
    "however , we have found this process to be computationally expensive and slightly unstable due the integral in equation [ eqn : badint ] below .",
    "its only true advantage is in the computation of the errors in the parameters and their covariances . using a maximum likelihood approach",
    ", one could calculate the full covariance matrix of the parameters introduced below . as will be shown below ,",
    "binning in n@xmath29  and then measuring the mass mixing will allow us to only easily find the covariance matrices of the parameters in sets of two . since we are not significantly concerned with the exact form of these errors or the covariances of the parameters , we choose to bin for simplicity .",
    "future analysis of this sort with pvd histograms will hopefully take a less model - dependent approach by deconvolving a gaussian directly from the stacked pvd histogram .",
    "this will allow for a direct confirmation of the distribution of velocity dispersions at fixed richness . also , a direct deconvolution would allow one to make mass mixing measurements of stacks of clusters binned on any observable .",
    "although the lognormal form assumed here may in fact have wider applicability , we can only confirm its use for clusters stacked by richness .",
    "we can write the shape of the non - background part of the stacked cluster - weighted pvd histogram , @xmath69 , as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the velocity separation value and @xmath66 is the gaussian width of a stacked set of similar velocity dispersion clusters . using the assumptions from the previous discussion , we let @xmath72 be a gaussian of width @xmath66 with mean zero , and @xmath73 be a lognormal distribution . performing the convolution , we get that @xmath69 is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the geometric mean of @xmath66  and @xmath76 is the standard deviation of @xmath77 .",
    "we note that the quantity @xmath78 is the percent scatter in @xmath66 .",
    "the second and fourth moments of this pvd distribution , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 for convenience we define the normalized kurtosis to be @xmath83 note that the odd moments of this distribution are expected to vanish , and in fact the data is consistent with both the first and third moments being zero . equation [ eqn : mu2disp ] shows us why the velocity dispersions derived directly from the second moment of the pvd histogram must be corrected .",
    "the factor of @xmath84 artificially increases the velocity dispersions .",
    "in practice this effect is at most @xmath85 at low richness and declines to @xmath86 for the most massive clusters in our sample .    to complete our model ,",
    "we need a term corresponding to the background of the pvd histogram .",
    "this background has two parts , an uncorrelated interloper component and an infall component ( i.e. galaxies which are not in virial equilibrium but are bound to the cluster in the infall region ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the uncorrelated background is a constant in the pvd histogram , while @xcite have shown that the infall component is not constant and forms a wider width component for pvd histograms around isolated galaxies .",
    "we ignore the possible infall components in our pvd histograms but note that they may bias the widths of our lognormal distributions high .",
    "investigation of this issue in the mock catalogs shows that the result of @xcite holds for galaxy clusters as well .",
    "although we do not explore this here , it may be possible to reduce the mass mixing signal from infalling galaxies by selecting galaxies by color ( i.e. red galaxies only or just maxbcg cluster members ) , which preferentially selects galaxies near the centers of the clusters .",
    "accounting for the constant interloper background , the full model of the cluster - weighted pvd histogram , @xmath87 , can now be written as , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the maximum allowed separation in velocity between the bcg and the cluster members , set to @xmath90 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath91 is a weighting factor that sets the background level in the pvd histogram . here",
    "we ignore the small error in the normalization due to integrating @xmath87 over @xmath71 from @xmath92 to @xmath93 instead of @xmath94 to @xmath89 .",
    "as long as @xmath89 is sufficiently large , say on the order of @xmath95 for a given pvd histogram , this error is small .",
    "now , it can be seen why the stacked pvd histogram must be weighted by cluster instead of by galaxy . in equation [ eqn :",
    "badint ] , equal weight is assigned to each cluster because @xmath72 is a gaussian normalized to integrate to unity . in order to predict the pair - weighted pvd",
    "histogram correctly , we would have to predict the total number of bgvcf  pairs , both cluster and background , as function of n@xmath29  and include this total in the integral and the background term .",
    "( the factors of @xmath91 and @xmath96 take care of the relative weighting of the background relative to cluster , assuming this weighting is the same for every cluster .",
    "this may not be true , in which case the factors of @xmath91 and @xmath96 would have to be included in the integral as well . ) this is a significant problem due to its dependence on redshift , local environment , and the selection function of the survey .    by using the cluster - weighted pvd histogram fit by the em algorithm derived in appendix [ app : emalg ] ( i.e. the 2gauss method )",
    ", we can avoid this issue .",
    "this weighting could be included in the baymix method as well .",
    "we choose to use the 2gauss method because it is more stable and less computationally expensive . in practice",
    "the extra weighting factors do not change our results drastically , indicating that most clusters already get approximately equivalent weight even in the pair - weighted pvd histogram .",
    "however , for completeness we include the weighting factor .",
    "note that two gaussians is the the fewest number of gaussians a distribution could be composed of and have a normalized kurtosis different from unity ( the normalized kurtosis of a single gaussian distribution is unity ) . according to equation [ eqn : normkurt ] ,",
    "then , if we measure a normalized kurtosis of unity for any of our bins , mass mixing in that bin ( i.e. @xmath76 ) will be zero .",
    "the quantities @xmath75 , @xmath97 , and @xmath91 are measured by binning the data in n@xmath29  and applying the 2gauss method as described earlier .",
    "this method outputs the constant background level @xmath91 automatically .",
    "the normalized kurtosis is calculated as @xmath98 and the second moment is calculated as @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the normalizations and standard deviations calculated for the two gaussians in the 2gauss pvd histogram fit .",
    "see appendix [ app : emalg ] for more details .",
    "although equation [ eqn : kurttngal ] is not properly normalized , we find that the bias correction computed in appendix [ app : bias ] is small , and thus equation [ eqn : kurttngal ] is a good estimator of the normalized kurtosis .    using equations [ eqn : mu2disp ] , [ eqn : normkurt ] , [ eqn : kurttngal ] , and [ eqn : sigmatngal ] , we solve for the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath97 .",

    "to correct the @xmath75 values for each bin in n@xmath29 , we use the mean of the quantity @xmath157 because the icvds are limited to low redshift , better sampled clusters , and our measurements are quite noisy .    in figure [",

    "we find that in fact , our correction will likely over correct the mean velocity dispersion so that it is 5 - 10% too low .",

    "the third set of tests are done with a spectroscopically - selected catalog run on lower redshift data , the c4 catalog @xcite . for this sample",
    ", we can compute the distribution of velocity dispersion at fixed richness by directly computing velocity dispersions for each individual cluster .",
    "we can then test our methods by comparing the measurements based on the stacked pvd histogram to the true measured distributions .      as a first check of our method with the data , we look for self - consistency . in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : modparms ]",
    ", we plot the mass mixing model integrated over the entire data set using equations [ eqn : badint ] , [ eqn : model ] , [ eqn : modmean ] , [ eqn : scatmodeltngal ] , and [ eqn : backmodtngal ] on top of the full cluster - weighted stacked pvd histogram .",

    "the reduced chi - square between the data and the mass mixing model is 1.31 , where we have used a robust , optimal bin size given by @xcite .",

    "the two agree to within one - sigma .",
    "we note however that the relation for the standard deviation of @xmath160 for the individual cluster velocity dispersions looks `` flatter '' as function of n@xmath29  than for the relation computed from the shape of the stacked pvd histogram .",
    "we hypothesize two possible explanations for this observation .",
    "first , the `` flatness '' could just be a statistical fluctuation . notice that according to the error bars , the relations are consistent with each other in most instances by less than one standard deviation .",
    "second , the `` flatness '' could be caused by a sampling effect with the population of clusters used to compute the individual cluster velocity dispersions .",
    "in other words , because we computed the individual velocity dispersions be requiring a cluster to have ten pairs in the bgvcf  within three - sigma of the bcg as given by the mean velocity dispersion relation , we selectively measure only a low redshift subset of the cluster population .",
    "this issue is however more than just insufficient sampling . for small groups of galaxies",
    ", it may be impossible to properly define an observationally - measurable velocity dispersion unless one is willing to stack groups of similar mass to fully sample their velocity distributions .",
    "thus we hypothesize that while the two relations disagree at low richness , the relation computed from the shape of the stacked pvd histograms may in fact be a better indicator of scatter in the @xmath161n@xmath29  relation for all richnesses , especially low richness clusters .",
    "when computing the model above , we used the entire magnitude - limited sample of the sdss spectroscopy . we can investigate selection effects by examining our model in both magnitude- and volume - limited samples .",
    "the volume - limited samples are constructed by extracting all galaxies above 0.4l@xmath17 , and below the redshift at which 0.4l@xmath17  is equal to the magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopy .",

    "we also binned the volume - limited sample in redshift to check for evolution in the scatter .",

    "this evolution will be described in detail in  [",
    "sec : zev ] for the full magnitude - limited sample .",
    "finally , we compare the mixing parameters measured with cluster members ( with redshifts ) defined by the maxbcg algorithm only to those measured with the entire spectroscopic sample ( i.e. the full bgvcf ) .",
    "we find no significant differences in this test .",
    "we might suspect , as suggested earlier , that cluster members better trace the fully virialized regions of clusters .",
    "either infalling galaxies do not contribute significantly , or the radial cut used to select members of the bgvcf  was small enough that most of the infalling galaxies could be excluded , except those directly along our line - of - sight .",
    "after running the maxbcg cluster finder on the mock catalogs , we measure the mass mixing of the identified clusters in the same way that it is measured for the maxbcg clusters identified in sdss data . in the bottom two panels of figure [ fig : mmixtest ] , the mass mixing parameters computed using the 2gauss method with the mass mixing model for clusters measured in the higher resolution simulation are compared to the true relations , found by matching our clusters to halos and then assigning a given cluster the dark matter velocity dispersion of its matched halo .",
    "we also performed the same analysis in a lower resolution simulation .",
    "we find that we can successfully predict the mass mixing in both simulations above their respective mass thresholds , except for the 5 - 10% downward bias of the mean value .",
    "the bias in the mean value of the velocity dispersion in the mock catalogs is due to the imperfect selection of member galaxies by the maxbcg cluster finding algorithm .",
    "when we select perfectly centered clusters ( i.e. cluster in which the true bcg at rest in the halo is found as the bcg by the maxbcg cluster finding algorithm ) and repeat the computation of @xmath155 , we find that the random member dispersions still do not increase by @xmath154 .",
    "instead , they increase by less than this factor and with this measured @xmath155 decreasing with n@xmath29 .",
    "however , we can recover the factor of @xmath154 if we use only halo centers and only members within r@xmath35  of the halo center .",
    "thus , because we can not perfectly select members , the quantity @xmath162 is a little more than unity , so that the bcg bias correction ( in which one divides by @xmath157 ) makes the mean too low . we can not test for this effect in the data directly , but the simulations indicate that it is less than 10% .    the matching between clusters and halos is done according to a slight modification of the method used by @xcite .",
    "the halos are first ranked in order of richness , highest to lowest . then the cluster with the most shared members with the halo",
    "is called the match .",
    "if two clusters share the same number of members , the one containing the halo bcg is taken as the match .",
    "if these two criteria fail to produce a unique match ( i.e. no cluster contains the halo s bcg ) , the cluster with a the higher richness measure is chosen as the match .",
    "finally , if all three criteria still fail to produce a unique match , the matching cluster is chosen at random from all clusters that meet all three criteria .",
    "when a match is made , both the cluster and halo are then removed from consideration and the next highest richness halo is matched in the same way .",
    "this procedure produces unique matches , but may not match every halo to a cluster or every cluster to a halo . of the halos with matched clusters in the high resolution mock catalogs , we find that the first criteria fails in only 6.23% of all cases . in these failed cases ,",
    "only 5.20% , 0.68% , and 0.35% of the halos are matched using the second , third , and fourth criteria respectively .    in the sdss data the use of cluster members only to construct the bgvcf  caused no change in the amount of mass mixing .",
    "we repeat this measurement in the higher resolution simulation using only the cluster members selected by the maxbcg algorithm to construct the bgvcf .",
    "we see no significant improvement in the prediction of the true mass mixing parameters using cluster members only as compared to using all galaxies in the bgvcf .    in the mock catalogs , we did not properly replicate the selection function of the sdss spectroscopic sample .",
    "unfortunately , the mock catalogs have approximately half the sky coverage area of sdss sample , so that when the proper selection function of the sdss spectroscopic sample is applied , there are too few galaxies to use with our methods .",
    "we require high signal - to - noise measurements of the fourth moment of the bgvcf , which is not possible with only half the sky coverage area .",
    "however , we can test for the effects of spectroscopic selection within the c4 sample , as described below .      using the c4 catalog @xcite",
    ", we can perform an independent test of our mass mixing method .",
    "the c4 catalog is produced by running the c4 cluster finding algorithm on low redshift sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "this algorithm finds clusters using their density in 4-d color space and 3-d position space .",
    "we make use of five pieces of information from the c4 catalog : a richness estimate , an estimate of the velocity dispersion of each cluster , the bcg redshift , the mean cluster redshift , and a `` structure contamination flag '' ( scf ) .",
    "this flag takes on the values of 0 , 1 , or 2 , depending upon the degree of interaction of a given cluster with any of its neighbors .",
    "isolated clusters have scf@xmath163 and clusters that have neighbors very close by ( i.e. @xmath164 ) have scf@xmath165 . clusters with scf = @xmath166 are in between these two extremes .",
    "the mean cluster redshift is the biweight mean @xcite redshift of all sdss spectroscopically - sampled galaxies within 1 @xmath33mpc and @xmath167 in redshift of the centroid found in the pvd histogram of the cluster .",
    "we use every cluster in the c4 catalog with scf@xmath168 and in the redshift range @xmath169 . centering on the bcgs listed in the c4 catalog , we process the clusters in the same way we have processed the maxbcg clusters ,",
    "i.e. we measure the bgvcfand then apply the 2gauss method with the mass mixing model to the pvd histogram . instead of using a projected radius cut of r@xmath35 we used a fixed radius of 1@xmath33mpc .",
    "we used a fixed radius here because we have no estimate of the natural radial scaling appropriate for the c4 richness measure . in order to have sufficient statistics for the computation of the mass mixing model",
    ", we are limited to splitting the clusters into two logarithmically - spaced bins of richness .",
    "we then compare our inferred distribution of velocity dispersions with the distribution of velocity dispersions for each individual c4 cluster in the catalog for each bin .",
    "the results are shown in the upper two panels of figure [ fig : c4mmix ] , which compares the lognormal with our derived parameters to the best fit lognormal for the individual c4 velocity dispersions .",
    "note the slight bias in the mean between the lognormal curves computed from the mass mixing model and the curves fit to the c4 velocity dispersions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : c4mmixclust ] , we repeat our measurements , but using the cluster redshift instead of the bcg redshift . in this case",
    "we see better agreement between the mass mixing measurements and the c4 velocity dispersions .",
    "this result indicates that the slight bias in the mean was due to movement of the bcgs .",
    "finally , to be complete , we compute the average velocity dispersion of the bcgs in each bin of c4 richness , and then use this value to correct the measurements made using bcg centers .",
    "we find that we can reproduce the cluster redshift measurements through this procedure .",
    "our understanding of how mis - centering and/or bcg movement effects our measurements is self - consistent in both the data and mock catalogs .",
    "if we had true cluster redshifts for the maxbcg clusters ( i.e. an accurate average redshift of all of the cluster members ) , then according to the results of the c4 catalog , no correction due to bcg bias would have to be applied to the mean velocity dispersion .",
    "we note that there seems to be high dispersion tail / shoulder in the histograms plotted in the upper panels of figures [ fig : c4mmix ] and figures [ fig : c4mmixclust ] .",
    "including clusters with scf@xmath165 increases this shoulder .",
    "this result is consistent with the finding of @xcite that clusters with scf@xmath165 have their measured velocity dispersions artificially increased by their nearby neighbors .",
    "this result is also consistent with a finding of @xcite , that the velocity dispersions of interacting dark matter halos form a high tail in the lognormal distribution of velocity dispersion at fixed mass . in the bottom panels of figures [ fig : c4mmix ] and [ fig : c4mmixclust ] , we repeat our measurements using cluster redshifts , now including only those clusters with scf@xmath163 , ( i.e. we exclude clusters with scf@xmath170 or 2 ) .",
    "the distribution of dispersions from this set of clusters is in better agreement with the mass mixing method .    in the maxbcg catalog , interacting clusters may not be as significant of a problem because the clusters are by definition much farther away from each other ( i.e. @xmath171 as opposed to @xmath172 for some clusters in the c4 catalog ) .",
    "in fact , many of the clusters that the c4 algorithm would flag as scf@xmath165 , the maxbcg algorithm may group together .",
    "we do not mean to imply that the maxbcg algorithm has a significant problem of over - merging distinct objects , but only that the redshift resolution of the cluster finder is less than the c4 algorithm .",
    "thus the high velocity dispersion shoulder would likely be down - weighted by algorithmic merging of objects together in combination with sparse spectroscopic sampling .",
    "for example , if two c4 clusters with scf@xmath165 would be merged by the maxbcg algorithm , then the velocity structure according to the maxbcg algorithm would only be measured about a combination center , and not two centers as in the c4 catalog .",
    "therefore , in combination with the sparse spectroscopic sampling , the relative weight of these two objects in a maxbcg pvd histogram might be decreased as compared to a c4 pvd histogram , where they would contribute twice as much and possibly at higher velocity dispersion .",
    "while these arguments remain untested at the moment , the high velocity dispersion shoulder seen in the upper panels of figures [ fig : c4mmix ] and [ fig : c4mmixclust ] has a clear origin and is well predicted theoretically .    for the c4 sample",
    ", we can also investigate the effects the spectroscopic selection .",
    "we recomputed our measurements using three higher r - band magnitude limits , 17.0 , 16.5 , and 16.0 . because the sdss main sample r - band magnitude limit is 17.8 , these three cuts replicate increasing amounts of spectroscopic incompleteness .",
    "we found no statistically significant differences between these measurements , indicating that spectroscopic incompleteness has a small effect on our measurements for the c4 catalog .",
    "here we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the choice of using a lognormal to describe the scatter in @xmath66  at fixed n@xmath29 .",
    "there may be other distributions that could possibly describe the scatter just as well . as a test case",
    ", we investigate how well a gaussian distribution describes the data in comparison with the lognormal .",
    "we first study whether the two scatter models result in different conclusions . in the sdss data",
    ", we find that at high richness the measured scatter assuming a gaussian or a lognormal differ by less than one standard deviation .",
    "however at low richness , the measured scatter in the two models differs by almost three standard deviations .",
    "these results can not tell us which model is better , but only whether one model is equivalent to the other .",
    "this seems to be the case in the sdss , except at low richness . from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", we prefer the lognormal model because it always ensures that @xmath173 without an arbitrary cutoff value .    in the c4 data the results are more dramatic : the measured scatter between the two models differs by around eight to ten standard deviations .",
    "this fact primarily reflects the fact that in the c4 catalog , there is high velocity dispersion tail / shoulder , which a lognormal distribution can fit much more easily than a gaussian",
    ". such a tail / shoulder may be less prevalent in the maxbcg clusters for reasons discussed previously .    in the mock catalogs ,",
    "the differences between the two models follow the same differences as function of richness as seen between the two models in the sdss data : they are quite similar but become more different at low richness . here , we can test which model provides a better match to the intrinsic dispersion in the catalog .",
    "we find that the scatter derived from the gaussian model differs from the true scatter at around four standard deviations , whereas the scatter derived from the lognormal model agrees well with the true scatter as shown in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : mmixtest ] .",
    "we have explicitly verified that the distribution of velocity dispersion at fixed richness is approximately lognormal for the mock catalogs .",
    "these results give us some confidence that the mock catalogs describe the sdss data well and that a lognormal is a better approximation to the true distribution than a gaussian at all richness , but especially lower richnesses .      using the mass mixing model and the abundance function of the maxbcg clusters",
    ", we can integrate to find the velocity dispersion function , usually defined as the number density of clusters per @xmath174 .",
    "this technique has been used to find the velocity dispersion function of early - type galaxies in the sdss @xcite and to estimate the x - ray luminosity function of reflex clusters @xcite .    in the interest of brevity ,",
    "the result presented here is only approximate .",
    "we assume a @xmath175cdm cosmology for our volume computation .",
    "we restrict our analysis here to only those clusters in the redshift range @xmath176 ( over which the catalog is approximately volume - limited ) , but we use the mixing results measured from the extended catalog .",
    "this procedure is justified because we previously observed no change in the mixing results using the smaller volume - limited sample .",
    "we do not include any corrections for the selection function of the catalog , but note that for the maxbcg clusters the completeness and purity are at or above the 90% level and approximately richness independent above n@xmath29@xmath177 @xcite .",
    "finally , we ignore any possible redshift evolution of the n@xmath29  measure .",
    "the velocity dispersion number function ( solid curve ) with systematic and statistical errors ( gray band ) is given in the left panel of figure [ fig : vdispfunct ] .",
    "due to these approximations , the systematic errors in our result could likely be reduced in a more detailed treatment .",
    "we aim here to demonstrate the feasibility of such an exercise and note that much more careful considerations of the selection function can be used to constrain cosmology rather well @xcite .",
    "the systematic errors shown here arise from the selection function , photometric redshift errors , and evolution in n@xmath29 .",
    "we estimate the total systematic error to be approximately 30% in the velocity dispersion function normalization due these effects .",
    "we also include a 10% systematic error in the geometric mean velocity dispersion due to the uncertain nature of the bcg bias correction .",
    "the statistical error bars are generated using a monte carlo technique , assuming poisson errors in the n@xmath29  number function and using the covariance matrices of the parameters determined in the chi - square line fits given by equations [ eqn : modmean ] and [ eqn : scatmodeltngal ] .",
    "the statistical errors are too small to be shown alone .",
    "instead , we plot the systematic error convolved with the statistical errors as a gray band in the left panel of figure [ fig : vdispfunct ] .    although a detailed treatment of the velocity dispersion function , which is beyond the scope of this paper , requires more careful consideration of velocity bias and the systematic errors , we provide a preliminary comparison to the predictions of the velocity dispersion function for three values of the power spectrum normalization . in order to make this prediction for our sample of clusters over the redshift range of the maxbcg catalog , @xmath176",

    "these three curves are plotted as the dashed , dash - dotted , and dotted lines in the left panel of figure [ fig : vdispfunct ] .",
    "we can give a qualitative estimate of the effect of the selection function of the maxbcg catalog on the velocity dispersion function . as noted previously , because the fraction of red galaxies in a clusters decreases with cluster mass , the maxbcg catalog may be incomplete in the lowest mass groups . this incompleteness would cause our calculation to underestimate the number density of such low mass groups , as seen in the left panel of figure [ fig : vdispfunct ] for the lowest velocity dispersion groups",
    ". note that the low mass deviation of the data from the predicted velocity dispersion functions occurs below @xmath180 km s@xmath1 .",

    "@xcite has shown that at high richness , the purity of the maxbcg catalog decreases .",
    "this decrease in purity would cause an overestimate in the number density of the most massive clusters , as seen in left panel of figure [ fig : vdispfunct ] for the highest velocity dispersion groups .",
    "also in the left panel of this figure , we compare our data to that of @xcite who compute the velocity dispersion function using an x - ray selected sample of local clusters .",
    "@xcite define a regular sample which excludes low redshift clusters and combines any multiple x - ray peaks within the clusters into a single peak .",

    "we find good agreement between our results and those of @xcite for both samples .",
    "note that the @xcite local sample of clusters has a median redshift of 0.06 whereas our sample has median redshift closer to 0.20 .",
    "thus we should not expect perfect agreement between the two samples because of evolution in the mass function , but according to the theoretical calculation , they would agree to well within 30% .    in the right panel of figure",

    "no direct dependence of the velocity dispersion on the local density has been found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to test this prediction , we construct four indicators of local density : n@xmath29  of closest cluster , the projected distance to the closest cluster , the total number of cluster members of any cluster within 5 @xmath33mpc and @xmath198 in redshift , and the total number of clusters within 5 @xmath33mpc and @xmath198 in redshift .",

    "we applied these tests to the mock catalogs as well , producing similar results .",
    "it has been shown that clusters which have undergone recent mergers and show significant substructure are not virialized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and that their velocity dispersions are increased above the expectation for their mass .",
    "one might expect that a cluster with multiple bright members that resemble the bcg has undergone a recent merger or has significant substructure .",
    "however , it has also been shown that dark matter halos which form earlier at fixed mass have brighter , redder central subhalos ( i.e. brighter , redder bcgs ) and lower richness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , this hypothesis is difficult to test observationally .",
    "one can similarly test for mass dependence of the clusters on the luminosity of the bcg alone . in the lower right panel of figure [ fig : secondparm ]",

    "we see dependence on this parameter : at fixed richness , clusters with more luminous bcgs have higher velocity dispersions .",
    "this same effect is observed in the stacked x - ray measurements of these same clusters by ( rykoff et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) ; here , clusters with brighter bcgs have on average more x - ray emission .",
    "these observations indicate that bcg luminosity may contain additional information about cluster mass beyond that in n@xmath29  alone .    in the case of bcg",
    "@xmath10-band luminosity , the expectd correlation mentioned above consistent with the observations , since early - forming halos would have brighter bcgs and lower richness , so that at fixed richness , halos with brighter bcgs tend to be more massive .",
    "however , for this explanation to be consistent with the previous hypothesis concerning the magnitude difference of the bcg and the next brightest cluster member , we must assume that whether or not a halo has formed through a major merger recently correlates more strongly with the magnitude difference of the bcg and the next brightest member galaxy , than with the bcg @xmath10-band luminosity alone .",
    "in other words , we need to assume that the bcg @xmath10-band luminosity is not indicative of a recent major merger ( which would cause the velocity dispersion to be overestimated at fixed mass ) , even though bcg @xmath10-band luminosity correlates with formation time .",
    "although we can not measure the true mass concentration , we investigate the dependence of the velocity - dispersion richness relation on the galaxy concentration , measured here by the ratio of the number of cluster members ( determined by the maxbcg cluster finder , not the number of pairs in the bgvcf ) within 0.2 r@xmath35  to the number of members within r@xmath35 .",

    "in order to connect the velocity - dispersion  richness relation to a mass  richness relation , we use the recent results of @xcite , who found a dark matter virial relation which appears to hold for all redshifts and a wide range of cosmologies .",
    "@xcite used a suite of dissipationless simulations run with a range of simulation codes and resolutions to measure the velocity dispersion of dark matter particles at fixed mass .",
    "they find that the dark matter virial relation can be characterized as a power - law , @xmath199 where @xmath188 km s@xmath1  @xmath189 is the dimensionless hubble parameter and @xmath190 is the mass within a sphere of over density 200 times the critical density at redshift z. the values of the fit parameters for the mean relation are found to be @xmath200 km s@xmath1  and @xmath201 .",
    "@xcite additionally found that the scatter of velocity dispersion at fixed mass is well fit by a lognormal with a small scatter of only @xmath202 .",
    "however , the lognormal scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed mass does not directly relate to the scatter in mass at fixed velocity dispersion without assuming the shape of the halo mass function . in light of this difficulty , and the small scatter in the relation ,",
    "we take the mean power - law relation given by @xcite to be a completely deterministic relation .",
    "as there is still substantial theoretical uncertainty in velocity bias , this will be a primary driver of the systematic error in the n@xmath29-mass relationship . to avoid this uncertainty",
    ", we constrain a combination of velocity bias and mass as described below . using the standard definition of velocity bias , @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the galaxy velocity dispersion and",
    "@xmath187 is the dark matter velocity dispersions .",
    "the virial relation for galaxy velocity dispersions then becomes @xmath205 where the quantity @xmath206 parameterizes our lack of knowledge about velocity bias .    to use this relation with the maxbcg clusters ,",
    "we calculate @xmath207 using the measured lognormal distribution of @xmath66 in each bin .",
    "the result is @xmath208 where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are given by the 2gauss fits for each n@xmath29  bin ( i.e. equations [ eqn : kurttngal ] and [ eqn : sigmatngal ] respectively ) .",
    "this value is then substituted for @xmath204 in equation [ eqn : dmvt ] . to account for the factor of @xmath211 , we repeat the 2gauss fits for each n@xmath29  bin , weighting each pair in the bgvcf  by @xmath212 .",
    "the inclusion of this factor has a negligible effect on the observed evolution in  [ sec : zev ] .",
    "we include the correction for bcg bias by dividing our results by the average bcg bias factor raised to the @xmath213 power .",
    "we apply this method first to the mock catalogs , to determine whether we recover an unbiased estimate of the mass  richness relation . in the left panel of figure",

    "we again see the slight over correction of the bcg bias correction . because the mass is proportional to @xmath214 , the masses we measure in the mock catalogs are too low by @xmath215 .",
    "the dashed line in the left panel of figure [ fig : mass ] shows the best - fit power - law relation between n@xmath29  and mass in the simulation , but with the normalization increased by 25% . note that in the mock catalogs the velocity bias is defined to be unity , so that equation [ eqn : dmvt ] should be exact with @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "the results for the maxbcg clusters are given in the right panel of figure [ fig : mass ] .",
    "the error bars include the theoretical uncertainties in both @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties increase the error bars in our mass determinations by a fixed factor uniformly across each bin .",

    "the dashed line shows the approximate effect of the bcg bias over correction by shifting the mass normalization up by 25% .",
    "in this paper we have presented new measurements of the bcg  galaxy velocity correlation function ( bgvcf ) for a sample of clusters identified from the sdss with the maxbcg algorithm @xcite . through careful modeling of the shape of the bgvcf",
    ", we have measured the mean and scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed n@xmath29 .",
    "we find that the mean velocity dispersion at fixed n@xmath29  is well described by a power - law .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion increases from @xmath0 km s@xmath1  for small groups to more than @xmath2 km s@xmath1  for large clusters .",
    "the scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed n@xmath29is at most @xmath3% and falls to @xmath4% as n@xmath29  increases .",
    "we test our methods on both the c4 cluster catalog and on mock catalogs .",
    "although there may be a slight 5 - 10% downward bias in the mean velocity dispersion due to the corrections made for bcg bias , our method successfully recovers the true scatter in both of these data sets with little bias .    the method presented here for measuring the scatter depends on two assumptions : ( 1 ) the gaussianity of the pvd histogram of a stacked set of clusters with similar velocity dispersion , and ( 2 ) the lognormal shape of the distribution of velocity dispersion at fixed richness .",
    "while the first assumption is valid in cluster samples produced by running the cluster finder on realistic mock catalogs , it is hard to directly test observationally .",
    "simulations with galaxies based on resolved dark matter subhalos may clarify this issue .",
    "the second assumption is directly supported in the mock catalogs and by independent observations with the c4 catalog @xcite .",
    "in addition to the measurement of the mean and scatter in the velocity - dispersion  richness relation , we explore the dependence of the velocity dispersion on parameters secondary to richness . the velocity dispersion seems to be affected significantly by the @xmath10-band luminosity of the bcg .",
    "we also see velocity dispersion dependence on redshift and local density .",
    "while the correlation between n@xmath29 , velocity dispersion , and the bcg @xmath10-band luminosity may be a true physical effect , we interpret the correlations of n@xmath29  and velocity dispersion with redshift and local density as unphysical , systematic effects of the maxbcg cluster finder .",
    "ultimately , it may be that the best way to estimate cluster mass will be to use multiple observables in combination . by making the comparisons of different parameters and their dependence on velocity dispersion as done in this paper",
    ", we will be able to determine which observables correlate significantly with mass .    our methods , in combination with weak lensing mass profiles measured for stacked maxbcg clusters ( sheldon et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ; johnston et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) and the radial phase - space information contained in the bgvcf , will allow for precise determinations of the velocity bias and the anisotropy of galaxy orbits in clusters .",
    "precise measurements of these quantities will help to constrain current theoretical models of galaxy clustering and the velocity bias between dark matter and galaxies .",
    "this work also demonstrates the feasibility of using our methods to measure the velocity dispersion function .",
    "the velocity dispersion function computed in this paper agrees with the results of @xcite .",
    "however , given the current estimated systematic errors in our computation ( due the selection function , photometric redshift errors , evolution in n@xmath29 , and the bcg bias correction ) , we are unable to reach any strong conclusions about the magnitude of @xmath178 . with this caveat , we do however see from figure [ fig : vdispfunct ] , that our results support a higher value of @xmath178 than the most recent cmb+lss estimates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as recently suggested by other analyses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . this conclusion is however degenerate with velocity bias .",
    "a velocity bias of approximately 1.1 - 1.2 could equally well explain our results .",
    "the methods presented in this paper are a significant advancement for the use of optical cluster surveys to determine cosmology .",
    "our method can fully characterize the velocity - dispersion  richness relation for any optical cluster survey with a large spectroscopic sample .",
    "future redshift surveys with more galaxy redshifts will allow for more precise measurements of this scatter . specifically , because the sdss spectroscopy is mostly at or below @xmath221 , a higher redshift sample of spectroscopy would allow for further tests of any redshift dependence .",
    "the measurement of the scatter in mass  observable relations is key to the measurement of cosmology from galaxy cluster surveys and self - calibration schemes @xcite . through adding an additional piece of observational information",
