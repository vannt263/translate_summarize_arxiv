    "recent budding interest on @xmath7 transition metal oxides stems from the promise for emergent novel quantum ground - states resulting from the cooperative effects of strong spin - orbit coupling and electron interactions.@xcite for example , various topological phases are proposed to occur , which include topological insulator , topological semi - metal and quantum spin liquid phases as well as unusual magnetic states and superconductors .    in particular , iridates have enjoyed significant attention due to the availability of a variety of materials.@xcite when spin - orbit coupling dominates over crystal field splitting , the basic electronic structure of iridates with ir@xmath3 ions can be described by the pseudospin @xmath8 kramers doublet,@xcite which is a combination of spin and orbital wave functions .",
    "hence , in the strong - coupling limit , the ir ions carry @xmath8 moments and the resulting interaction between them presents highly quantum mechanical fluctuations .",
    "such an interacting local moment system would be an ideal platform for emergent quantum spin liquid states@xcite when it is placed on geometrically frustrated lattices or the interaction itself has the capacity to generate massive classical degeneracy .",
    "currently two different classes of systems have been proposed for possible quantum spin liquid phases in iridates . in the hyperkagome iridate ,",
    "na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite the ir ions form a three - dimensional network of corner - sharing triangles , which provides the geometric frustration for the heisenberg model .",
    "indeed no magnetic ordering has been observed down to a few kelvin in spite of the large curie - weiss temperature , @xmath9.@xcite possible quantum spin liquid and other related phases have been investigated via a variety of theoretical approaches.@xcite in an alternative avenue , 2d ( na@xmath10iro@xmath1 , @xmath11-li@xmath10iro@xmath1 ) honeycomb@xcite and 3d ( @xmath12- or @xmath13-li@xmath10iro@xmath1 ) hyperhoneycomb@xcite iridates have been investigated in the context of bond - dependent interactions , such as the kitaev interaction , between local moments@xcite .",
    "such interactions , even if they are placed on bipartite lattices such as the honeycomb lattice , would generate extensive classical degeneracy and may lead to quantum spin liquid phases , as is the case for the pure kitaev model.@xcite    in this work , we investigate a generic local - moment model for the hyperkagome iridate , and we examine the effects of anisotropic interactions beyond the heisenberg limit .",
    "earlier works on the hyperkagome iridate were focused mostly on the heisenberg model@xcite or the effects of selected sets of anisotropic interactions.@xcite here we provide the derivation of a generic model for @xmath14 local moments of ir@xmath3 ions by taking into account multiorbital interactions such as hund s coupling and spin - orbit coupling . in fact , effects of hund s coupling were not considered in previous studies even though it is crucial for the appearance of anisotropic spin interactions in the hyperkagome iridate that has an edge - sharing structure of iro@xmath15 octahedra.@xcite the missing hund s coupling is taken into account in our microscopic construction of the spin model .",
    "remarkably , various  frustrating \" bond - anisotropic interactions arise .",
    "the resulting model is characterized by four parameters ; @xmath16 for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg exchange , @xmath17 for the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , @xmath18 for a kitaev - like term , and @xmath19 for the symmetric anisotropic exchange .",
    "the relative sign and form of the three different anisotropic exchange interactions depend on the bond directions and are completely fixed by the lattice symmetries . as a result , the generic model for the hyperkagome iridate has both of the ingredients for massive classical degeneracy , namely geometric frustration and frustrated exchange interactions .",
    "indeed all of the @xmath16-only , @xmath18-only , @xmath19-only models are frustrated and support distinct sets of a classically - degenerate manifold .",
    "this is in contrast to the honeycomb or hyperhoneycomb systems , in which @xmath16-only model leads to a unique antiferromagnetically - ordered ground - state .    given that the curie - weiss temperature is large and negative , we assume that @xmath20 is the dominant energy scale and examine the effects of small anisotropic interactions represented by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "this approach is motivated by recent @xmath6sr and nmr experiments in which short - range spin correlations and/or some kind of spin freezing behaviors have been discovered below @xmath21-@xmath22.@xcite the idea is that various small anisotropic interactions become much more important below 6 - 7@xmath18 and the understanding of the nature of the ground - state may require careful examination of the effects of these small perturbations , while the physics of the higher temperature phase may still be understood using the heisenberg interaction .    as the first step towards this goal ,",
    "we map out the magnetic phase diagram for the classical model using the luttinger - tisza@xcite and classical monte carlo simulated annealing methods .",
    "in particular , we examine how the massive classical degeneracy of the heisenberg model is lifted depending on which anisotropic interaction is dominant . the resulting phase diagram for a selected set of parameters",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) refers to the manifold of classical ground - states where the direction of one ( two ) of the moments on each triangle is almost parallel to the local @xmath28 axis at each site , which we will define later , while the remaining two ( one ) are not ( see figs .",

    "if @xmath29 and @xmath31 , the @xmath23 state with @xmath26 degeneracy is dominant for relatively large @xmath19 . on the other hand , when @xmath32 and @xmath31 , the @xmath23 state with @xmath27 degeneracy becomes dominant for large @xmath18 . in general",

    "[ fig : windmill ] , [ fig : z6_2p ] , and [ fig : z6_1p ] ) .",
    "if the @xmath23 states with discrete degeneracy dominate the low temperature short - range spin correlations , one of the degenerate states , once it is formed locally in certain regions , may not easily relax to another degenerate configurations .",
    "this is due to the constrained spin dynamics in frustrated magnets , as explained in the main text .",
    "the energy / temperature scale where these phenomena occur will be set by the dominant anisotropic interactions .",
    "this may explain the spin freezing or slow spin dynamics observed in the experiments .",
