    "the study of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum has been a great challenge since the first measurements made at the end of the seventies . actually , the first experiments provided data which , in the low energy tail , showed some excess when compared to the current model predictions .",
    "this discrepancy stimulated a great interest into alternative explanations , viz the possible existence of primary antiproton sources .",
    "such an interest did not fade even when further experimental data seemed to agree with theoretical predictions in standard leaky box models ( see for example stephens & golden 1988 and references therein ) .",
    "various primary antiproton sources have been proposed ( silk & srednicki 1984 ; stecker , rudaz , & walsh 1985 ; ellis et al .",
    "1988 ; starkman & vachaspati 1996 ; mitsui , maki , & orito 1996 ) .",
    "the case of supersymmetric sources ",
    "relic neutralinos in the galactic halo  has received a particular attention and constraints on susy parameters have been investigated by comparing experimental data to theoretical predictions ( bottino et al .",
    "1995 ; chardonnet et al . 1996",
    "; bottino et al . 1998 ; bergstrm , edsj , & ullio 1999 ) .",
    "however , an important problem with this comparison is that an accurate estimation of the background secondary antiproton flux produced by spallations is mandatory .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on this secondary antiproton flux , which we will call  background \" antiproton flux , having in mind the possibility of using it to determine whether one of the primary components (  signal \" ) discussed above could be seen against it or not ( p. salati & al , in preparation ; a. barrau & al , in preparation ) .",
    "such hypothetical signals will not be further discussed in this paper .",
    "we believe that now is a good time for a detailed evaluation of the background flux , since the next measurements of @xmath0 spectra should be very accurate at low energy ( @xmath1 ) especially in the forthcoming ten years ( ams , bess , pamela ,  ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "progress has already been made in many directions . here",
    "are some milestones on the way : ( i ) the inelastic non - annihilating cross - section for @xmath0 ( tan & ng 1982 , 1983 ) , giving rise to the so  called tertiary contribution , has been taken into account ( ii ) the @xmath2 contribution has been considered by means of a simple geometric approach ( gaisser & schaefer 1992 ) , ( iii ) reacceleration has been considered ( simon & heinbach 1996 ) , ( iv ) propagation has been modeled in a more realistic two  zone diffusion model ( halm , jansen , & de niem 1993 ; chardonnet et al .",
    "1996 ) , ( v ) the @xmath3 reactions have been re - estimated in a more sophisticated nuclear monte carlo ( simon , molnar , & roesler 1998 ) , ( vi ) the great variety of cosmic rays has been treated in a more coherent way ( moskalenko , strong & reimer 1998 ) . as far as we know ,",
    "all these ingredients have only been considered simultaneously in moskalenko et al .",
    "1998 ( see also moskalenko et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we propose to go beyond this type of study and to use the results of our systematic analysis of nuclei ( maurin et al .",
    "2001 , referred hereafter as paper i ) to ascertain the theoretical uncertainties on the interstellar secondary antiproton energy spectrum .",
    "this goal has never been achieved before , even in moskalenko et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "separate sections are devoted to all the ingredients entering the calculation of the @xmath0 background : measured h and he flux , secondary production , tertiary contribution and propagation .",
    "whithin each section , we first discuss the model used and the associated parameters ; then we estimate the uncertainty they induce in the @xmath0 background .",
    "an important aspect is worth a warning at this point . as will be discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , the effect of solar modulation may be decoupled from the problem of interstellar propagation and this problem will not be addressed here .",
    "when a modulated flux is needed , we will use a simple force - field approximation modulation scheme , as in most cosmic antiprotons studies .",
    "would a more careful treatment of solar modulation be needed ( see for example bieber et al .",
    "1999 ) , an interstellar flux can easily be obtained by demodulation ( the force - field approximation modulation scheme is reversible ) .",
    "this interstellar flux could then be used as an input for any other preferred treatment of solar modulation .    to sum up",
    ", we used results from a systematic nuclei cosmic ray analysis to consistently derive an antiproton secondary flux in the framework of diffusion models .",
    "as an important consequence we could study and quantify most of the uncertainties : in the propagation , in the nuclear physics and in the primary cosmic ray .",
    "we feel that our results will be valuable not only for speculations on primary contributions to that flux but also for the experimental groups which are going to perform very accurate antiproton measurements in the near future .",
    "the secondary antiprotons are yielded by the spallation of cosmic ray nuclei over the interstellar medium ( see appendix a for the formul ) .",
    "the most abundant species in cosmic rays are protons and helium , and the contribution of heavier nuclei to the antiproton production is negligible . until recently , their spectra were known with a modest accuracy and the data from different experiments were often incompatible at high energy .",
    "this induced an uncertainty of some tens of percents in the predicted antiproton spectrum .",
    "recent measurements made by the balloon ",
    "borne spectrometer bess ( sanuki et al . 2000 ) and by the ams detector during the space shuttle flight ( alcaraz et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b , 2000c ) dramatically reduced the uncertainties both on proton and helium spectra .",
    "we fitted the high energy ( t @xmath4 20 gev / n ) part of these measured spectra with the power law : @xmath5 where the kinetic energy per nucleon t is given in units of gev / n and the normalization factor n in units of @xmath6 .",
    "this provides a good description down to the threshold energy for the antiproton production .",
    "we fitted the bess and ams data both separately and combined , obtaining very similar results .",
    "this is obvious since the data from the two experiments are now totally compatible , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : proton_helium ] .",
    "the upper curve presents our fit on the combined proton data .",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we do not plot the spectra obtained from the best fits on the single bess and ams data because of their complete overlap with the plotted curve .",
    "we did the same for helium ( lower curve ) and the corresponding numbers are @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the 1@xmath11 deviation from the best fit spectrum does not exceed 1@xmath12 for both species .",
    "consequently , the corresponding uncertainty on the antiproton spectrum is smaller than the ones discussed in the next sections , and it will be neglected in the rest of this paper . the situation has significantly improved since bottino & al .",
    "1998 , where an error of @xmath13 25% was quoted .",
    "whereas p  p interactions are clearly the dominant process for secondary antiproton production in the galaxy , it has been realized long ago that p  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus collisions should also be taken into account @xcite .",
    "they not only enhance the antiproton flux as a whole but also change its low energy tail , mostly for kinematical reasons .",
    "unfortunately , very few experimental data are available on antiproton production cross - sections in nuclear collisions .",
    "a model - based evaluation is therefore necessary , and we chose to use the dtunuc program . we first discuss sub - threshold antiproton production",
    ". then we present the results of our calculations of above - threshold production , which we compare to experimental data and analytical formul .",
    "antiproton production _ via _ the proton ",
    "proton interaction is the first reaction that one has to take into account in order to evaluate the @xmath0 flux .",
    "so far , the tan & ng parameterization of @xmath0 cross - section ( tan & ng 1982 , 1983 ) has been used by almost all studies on cosmic ray antiprotons . to be more precise",
    ", we recall the form of secondary contribution ( _ e.g. _ eq . [ [ secondary_1 ] ] , appendix [ sec : hel ] ) @xmath14 thus , in order to evaluate the secondary contribution of @xmath15 reaction , we used the parameterization of tan & ng ( 1982 , 1983 ) .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the short discussion in bottino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for further details , or to the source papers ( tan & ng 1982 , 1983 ) for a complete description . finally , as an illustration",
    ", the impact of kinematics and threshold for the production rate can be found in gaisser & schaefer ( 1992 ) .      some discrepancies between simple scalings of p ",
    "p cross - sections and experimental data on p  nucleus antiproton production cross - sections near threshold have been explained by taking into account internal nuclear fermi motion @xcite .",
    "we first show that this effect does not change the cosmic antiproton spectrum . in such models ,",
    "the momentum distribution is described by a double - gaussian function normalized to the total number of nucleons .",
    "the parameters are determined from scattering experiments @xcite and simple scaling laws .",
    "the cross - section results from a convolution @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the internal nuclear momentum of the target nucleon , n denotes either a proton or a neutron ( the model is isospin independent ) and e@xmath18 is the center of mass energy ( with an off  shell target nucleon ) .    near threshold , the nucleon ",
    "nucleon cross - section can be estimated from the transition matrix element and the available phase space by fermi s golden rule . using this simple approach with only one free parameter ( namely the matrix element ) ,",
    "fitted on data , we have been able to reproduce very well most experimental results available on subthreshold antiproton production .",
    "the kinematical term was computed using a monte carlo multi - particle weighted event according to lorentz - invariant fermi phase space , whereas the integral was performed by adaptable gaussian quadrature .",
    "this method is not relevant to accurately determine the p  he , he ",
    "p or he  he cross - sections at any energy ( as the momentum distribution becomes a @xmath19 function when the involved momenta are much greater than the fermi momentum ) but just to investigate their behaviour below the 6 gev kinetic energy threshold .",
    "the main result is a very fast drop below the threshold .",
    "even after convolution with the @xmath20 differential power law spectrum of primary cosmic rays , two orders of magnitude are lost in less than two gev below the threshold . as a consequence , the subthreshold cross section can be neglected to compute the secondary antiprotons flux .",
    "the above - threshold discrepancies between data and simple models can not be accounted for by this effect and a numerical monte carlo approach is necessary .    following simon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the monte carlo program dtunuc version 2.3 was therefore used to evaluate the cross - sections for p  he , he ",
    "p and he - he antiproton production reactions .",
    "p reaction can be well accounted by the tan & ng parameterization ( see previous section ) whereas those involving nuclei heavier than helium are negligible due to cosmic abundances .",
    "this program is an implementation of the two - component dual parton model ( capella et al .",
    "1994 ) based on the gribov - glauber approach treating soft and hard scattering processes in a unified way .",
    "soft processes are parameterized according to regge phenomenology whereas lowest order perturbative qcd is used to simulate the hard component @xcite .",
    "this program calls phojet @xcite to treat individual hadron / nucleon / photon - nucleon interaction , pythia @xcite for fragmentation of parton ( according to the lund model ) and lepto @xcite for deep inelastic scattering off nuclei .",
    "the resulting cross - sections have been compared with experimental data on proton  nucleus collisions .",
    "figure [ fig : sugaya ] shows the differential cross - section of antiprotons production in p+c and p+al collisions at 12 gev laboratory kinetic energy recently measured at the proton synchrotron in the high energy accelerator research organisation ( kek  ps ) for different antiprotons momenta @xcite . in most cases , measurements and dtunuc simulations are compatible within uncertainties .",
    "the discrepancies are , anyway , taken into account in section [ sec : uncertainties ] as uncertainties on the computed cross - sections .",
    "figure [ fig : abbott ] shows the invariant spectrum of antiprotons in p+al collisions at 14.6 gev / c laboratory momentum as a function of @xmath21 where @xmath22 as obtained by experiment 802 at the brookhaven tandem alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) @xcite .",
    "data points have been normalized by using the inelastic cross - sections and plotted for a rapidity interval of @xmath23 .",
    "the results of dtunuc simulations are in perfect agreement with the measurements .",
    "this check is particularly important as it stands within the projectile energy range where most cosmic antiprotons are produced .",
    "taking into account the qualitative predictions of the regge phenomenology and partons model , mokhov & nikitin ( 1977 ) derived a parametrized inclusive cross - section for @xmath24 : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 s is the invariant mass of system , @xmath28 is the transverse momentum , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the total energy of the inclusive particle in the center of mass frame and its maximum possible value .",
    "the parameters @xmath33 to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 were not taken as given in kalinovskii et al .",
    "( 1989 ) but were re  fitted using an extensive set of experimental data leading to a better @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "contrary to experimental measurements that are only available for a small number of given energies , this analytical approach allows a useful comparison with dtunuc cross - sections .",
    "the resulting spectrum has therefore been propagated using the model described in section [ section : la ] and the results are in excellent agreement . the dtunuc approach was nevertheless preferred since the mokhov ",
    "nikitin formula was fitted on rather heavy nuclei , and its use for p  he , he ",
    "p and he  he collisions would therefore require a substantial extrapolation .",
    "the exclusive cross - section for antiproton production @xmath39 , is obtained by multiplying the total inelastic cross - section of the considered reaction and the antiproton multiplicity interaction given by dtunuc .",
    "this approach is time consuming since the cross - section is quite low and a large number of events must be generated to reach acceptable statistical uncertainties .",
    "the sampling points were chosen to be distributed on a logarithmic scale between 7 gev ( threshold ) and 10 tev per nucleon for the projectile nucleus and extrapolations rely on polynomial fits .",
    "the antiproton kinetic energy was varied from 0.1 gev to 100 gev .",
    "figure [ fig : pbar ] gives some examples of differential antiproton production cross - sections as obtained from dtunuc .",
    "once they have been created , antiprotons may interact with the interstellar material in three different ways .",
    "first , they may undergo elastic scatterings on galactic hydrogen .",
    "the cross - section for that reaction has been shown to peak in the forward direction @xcite so that the corresponding antiproton energy loss is negligible",
    ". antiprotons are not perturbed by these elastic scatterings as they survive them while their energy does not change .",
    "they may also annihilate on interstellar protons .",
    "this process dominates at low energy , and its cross - section is given in tan & ng ( 1983 ) .",
    "last but not least , antiprotons may survive inelastic scatterings where the target proton is excited to a resonance .",
    "antiprotons do not annihilate but lose a significant amount of their kinetic energy .",
    "both annihilations and non  annihilating interactions contribute to the inelastic antiproton cross - section so that @xmath40 where @xmath41 is parametrized as in tan & ng ( 1983 ) .    for an antiproton kinetic energy @xmath42 gev ,",
    "the tan & ng parameterization of @xmath43  which is based on experimental data  is no longer valid .",
    "the annihilation cross - section tends furthermore to be small at high energy . in any case , the antiproton inelastic but non  annihilating interaction cross section becomes equal to the total proton inelastic cross - section @xmath44 the low and high energy relations for @xmath45 do match for an antiproton kinetic energy of @xmath46 gev .",
    "the energy distribution of antiprotons that have undergone an inelastic but non  annihilating interaction has not been measured .",
    "it has been assumed here to be similar to the proton energy distribution after p  p inelastic scattering .",
    "an impinging antiproton with kinetic energy @xmath47 has then a differential probability of @xmath48 to end up with the final energy @xmath49 .",
    "that reaction leads to the flattening of their energy spectrum as the high  energy species of the peak that sits around a few gev may replenish the low  energy part of the energy distribution .",
    "the corresponding source term for these so  called tertiary antiprotons may be expressed as @xmath50 since the differential cross - section is given by @xmath51 the tertiary production term translates into @xmath52 the integral over the antiproton energy @xmath53 of @xmath54 vanishes .",
    "this mechanism does not actually create new antiprotons .",
    "it merely redistributes them towards lower energies and tends therefore to flatten their spectrum .",
    "notice in that respect that the secondary antiproton spectrum that results from the interaction of cosmic ray protons impinging on interstellar helium is already fairly flat below a few gev .",
    "since it contributes a large fraction to the final result , the effect under scrutiny here may not be as large as previously thought @xcite .    as a matter of fact",
    ", antiprotons interact on both the hydrogen and helium of the milky ",
    "way ridge .",
    "helium should also be taken into account in the discussion .",
    "as explained in appendix ( [ cornofulgur ] ) , we have replaced the hydrogen density in relation ( [ belle_et_sebastien ] ) by the geometrical factor @xmath55 for the calculation of the tertiary component .",
    "propagation of cosmic rays can be studied within different theoretical frameworks , the most popular being the so - called leaky box model and the diffusion model .",
    "there is a mathematical equivalence of these two approaches , which is valid only under special circumstances . in particular , they lead to different results for low grammages and for unstable cosmic ray species ( see discussion in maurin et al .",
    "our preference for the diffusion model has several justifications .",
    "first , it is a more physical approach , in the sense that cosmic rays are believed to diffuse in the galactic disk and halo , which is in disagreement with the spatial homogeneity assumed in the leaky box .",
    "second , the parameters entering the diffusion models are related to measurable physical quantities ( at least in principle ) , like the galactic magnetic field , so that their value could be cross - checked with independent measurements .",
    "finally , the diffusion approach is mandatory if one wants to take primary sources into account , as emphasized in the introduction .",
    "the geometry of the problem used here is a classical cylindrical box ( see for example webber , lee , & gupta 1992 ) whose radial extension is @xmath56 , with a disk of thickness @xmath57 and a halo of half ",
    "height @xmath58 lying in the interval @xmath59{\\ ; \\mbox{kpc}}$ ] .",
    "sources and interactions with matter are confined to the thin disk and diffusion which occurs throughout disc and halo with the same strength is independent of space coordinates .",
    "the solar system is located in the galactic disc ( @xmath60 ) and at a centrogalactic distance @xmath61 ( stanek & garnavich 1998 ; alves 2000 ) .",
    "we emphasize that this model is exactly the one that has been used for the propagation of charged nuclei ( paper i ) where it has been described in details .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we rewrite here the basic ingredients , and the parameters of the diffusion model we used .",
    "our model takes into account the minimal known physical processes thought to be present during the propagation .",
    "firstly , the diffusion coefficient @xmath62 @xmath63 where the normalisation @xmath64 is expressed in kpc@xmath65 and @xmath19 is the spectral index ( @xmath66 stands for the particle rigidity ) .",
    "along with the spatial diffusion , one has the associated diffusion in energy space represented by a reacceleration term @xmath67 here @xmath68 stands for the energy diffusion coefficient which we evaluated in the no  recoil hard sphere scattering centers approximation .",
    "in particular @xmath69 is the alfvnic speed of scatterers responsible of the energetic diffusion .",
    "next , we allow a constant convective wind directed outward in the @xmath70 direction .",
    "this term is represented by the velocity @xmath71 .",
    "motivation of such forms for the various parameters has been given in paper i and will not be repeated here .",
    "last , we have to include effects of energy losses .",
    "formul for the latter are those used for nuclei with the appropriated charge for an antiproton ( see paper i ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "diffusion model is described with five parameters : the diffusion coefficient normalization @xmath64 and its power index @xmath19 , the convective galactic wind velocity @xmath71 , the alfvnic speed @xmath69 , and finally the halo thickness @xmath58 .",
    "the values of these parameters are needed to compute the propagated antiproton flux .",
    "they may be extracted from a careful analysis of charged cosmic ray nuclei data .",
    "this has been done in a previous study ( paper i ) , where all the sets of parameters consistent with b / c and sub  fe / fe data were determined . as the propagation history for all cosmic rays should be similar , this is thought to be a safe procedure . in this work , we used the same sets and the same numerical code to propagate antiprotons , to make sure our treatment is fully consistent with our previous work and that the results are consistent with nuclei data .",
    "this is in variance with previous works using diffusion models , where the propagation parameters were extracted from a leaky box analysis of nuclei .",
    "it should be noticed that some of the sets of parameters are probably disfavored by physical considerations .",
    "for instance , our models have alfven velocities @xmath69 ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "the upper end of this range is too high .",
    "indeed , the value of the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath74 , see for example han & qiao ( 1994 ) or rand & lyne ( 1994 ) ) and the plasma density ( @xmath75 according to nordgren , cordes & terzian ( 1992 ) ) give @xmath76 .",
    "besides , as mentionned in paper i , the physical meaning of the value of @xmath69 may depend on the assumptions made for the scattering process . a proportionality coefficient larger than @xmath77 in relation ( [ all is for the butter ] )",
    "would imply smaller values for @xmath69 .",
    "the following point should also be kept in mind : we considered that reacceleration only occured in the thin disk , _",
    "i.e. _ in a zone of half - height @xmath78",
    ". if this process is efficient in a larger zone ( @xmath79 ) , the overall effect is unchanged provided that the alfven velocity is scaled down to a lower value as @xmath80 ( seo & ptuskin 1994 ) . in our semi - analytical resolution of the diffusion model , the case @xmath81 can not be straightforwardly taken into account , but the previous conclusion would still hold . indeed , we can make the reacceleration zone larger by increasing the disk thickness @xmath82 , while keeping constant the quantity @xmath83 so that all the other effects are unaffected . for example",
    ", a @xmath84 reacceleration zone would lead to alfven velocities about three times smaller so that in the sets of parameters used in this study , @xmath69 would range between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "anyway , we adopt a conservative attitude and we do not apply any cut in our initial sets of parameters .    to sum up , we have applied all the configurations giving a good @xmath38 ( less than 40 for 26 data points and 5 parameters ) in the b / c analysis of paper i ( see this paper for an extensive description of the nuclei analysis ) .",
    "we insist on the fact that none of this parameter is further modified or adjusted , they are not free parameters .",
    "once the set of diffusion  propagation parameters is chosen as explained above , evaluation of the corresponding flux is straightforward .",
    "semi  analytical solution for the antiproton background is given in appendix [ sec : sol diffusion model ] .",
    "apart from the propagation , the two other necessary inputs are  as one can see from equation ( [ secondary_1 ] )  the measured top of atmosphere h and he flux discussed in section [ section : trop bien ] , and the nuclear processes described in section [ section : ici ] and [ section : la ] .    to compare our results to experimental data , solar modulation ( the effect of the solar wind on the interstellar flux crossing the heliosphere )",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "we chose to use the so - called force - field approximation , which is used in most antiproton studies ( see last section for a discussion ) .",
    "in all the subsequent results , the top  of  atmosphere antiproton flux has been obtained from the interstellar one with a modulation parameter of @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , adapted for a period of minimal solar activity .",
    "this choice is motivated by the comparison to bess data taken during the last solar minimum .",
    "we have calculated the secondary , top  of  atmosphere antiproton spectrum obtained with the procedure described above . to begin with , we chose a particular set of diffusion parameters giving a good fit to the b / c data ( see above ) .",
    "namely , we have fixed : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91s and @xmath92s .",
    "this set gives the best @xmath38 for @xmath19 fixed to @xmath93 and the resulting antiproton spectrum will be used as a reference in most subsequent figures .",

    "first of all , we notice that the calculated spectrum agrees very well with the bess data points .",
    "this strong result gives confidence in our consistent treatment of nuclei and antiproton propagation .",
    "second , even if the main production channel is the spallation of cosmic ray protons over interstellar hydrogen , we see that the contribution of protons over helium is very important , particularly at low energies ( where a hypothetical primary signature would be expected ) .",
    "it emphasizes the necessity of having a good parameterization of the p  he reaction .    in the following sections , we study and quantify all the uncertainties and possible sources of errors in the secondary antiproton flux given above .",

    "a quantitative estimate for this uncertainty is obtained by applying all the good parameter sets to antiproton propagation . in a first step",
    ", we set the diffusion coefficient spectral index @xmath19 to 0.6 and allow the four other parameters ( @xmath64 , @xmath58 , @xmath71 and @xmath69 ) to vary in the part of the parameter space giving a good fit to b / c .",

    "this gives our estimate of the uncertainties related to diffusion .",
    "they may be considered as quite conservative , as the range of allowed parameters could probably be further reduced by a thorough analysis of radioactive nuclei ( donato et al , in preparation ) and also by new measurements of stable species .      the uncertainties on the antiproton production cross - sections from p - he , he - p and he - he reactions have been evaluated using the most extensive set of experimental data available .",

    "we parameterized _ maxima _ and _ mimina _ cross - sections as a correction to the computed ones , depending on the projectile and antiproton energies .",
    "the simplest , _ i.e. _ linear , energy variation was assumed and the slope was chosen to be very conservative with respect to experimental data . finally , it has been checked that changes in the monte carlo results induced by small variations of the input physical parameters remain within the previously computed errors .    according to tan & ng ( 1982 , 1983 ) , the uncertainty in the parameterization of their p ",
    "p cross - section should not exceed 10@xmath12 . from another point of view , simon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have compared two parameterization of the existing data along with the monte carlo model dtunuc .",
    "they found large discrepancies which induce a 40% effect on the antiproton prediction .",
    "nevertheless , since data are available for that reaction , we think that the tan & ng parameterization is more reliable than any monte carlo .    in fig .",
    "[ pbar_nuclear_uncertainty ] we present our estimation of the uncertainties related to nuclear physics . the central curve is our reference presented above .",
    "the upper one is obtained with the set of maximal p  he , he  p , he  he cross - sections while increasing the p ",
    "p cross - section by 10@xmath12 .",
    "similarly , the lower curve is obtained with the minimal values for these cross - sections while decreasing the p ",
    "p cross - section by 10@xmath12 .",
    "indeed , such a variation for p ",
    "p has been included for the sake of completeness even if it modifies the antiproton spectrum only by a few percents . as a conclusion , the shift of the upper and the lower curve with respect to the central one is of the order of 2225  @xmath12 over the energy range 0.1100 gev .    besides these major sources of uncertainties , we have also investigated the influence of a possible error in the parameterization of the inelastic non  annihilating cross - section , which gives rise to the tertiary component .",
    "we modified it by 20@xmath12 , which is thought to be very conservative .",
    "we found that the antiproton spectrum is modified by less than 1@xmath12 .",
    "in the same line of thought , the effect of total inelastic plus non - annihilating reactions on interstellar he is found to be negligible ( see discussion in appendix [ cornofulgur ] ) .",
    "there are few other sources of uncertainties . to begin with , as we discussed in section [ section : trop bien ] , primary cosmic ray fluxes ( protons and helium ) have been measured with unprecedented accuracy . for the first time , the induced uncertainties on the antiproton spectrum can be neglected .    next ,",
    "the only parameters which have not been varied in the previous discussion are those related to the description of the interstellar medium , _",
    "i.e. _ the densities @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in all the preceding analysis ,",
    "these were fixed to @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( same as in paper i ) .",
    "we have tested the sensitivity of our results to changes in both @xmath107 and @xmath108 . for this purpose",
    ", we found the new values for the diffusion parameters ( for @xmath109 ) giving a good fit to b / c , and applied them to antiprotons .",
    "varying @xmath108 in the range @xmath110 , the resulting flux is modified by less than @xmath111 over the whole energy range .",
    "notice that this range of @xmath108 values can be considered as very conservative ( see discussion in strong & moskalenko 1998 ) . a more realistic 10% error on @xmath108 ( i.e. @xmath112 ) would lead to a few % error on the antiproton spectrum .",
    "alternatively , varying @xmath107 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 , the resulting flux is modified by less than @xmath115 over the whole energy range . to sum up ,",
    "the only contributing errors are from the helium fraction @xmath108 through the dependence of antiproton production on corresponding cross - sections .",
    "finally , solar modulation induces some uncertainty .",
    "this problem is still debated , and a rigorous treatment of this effect is beyond the scope of this paper ( see for example bieber et al .",
    "1999 for a recent analysis ) .",
    "however , in a  force - field \" approximation , a general feature is that the steeper the spectrum , the greater the effect .",
    "our antiproton spectra being rather flat , we do not expect them to be dramatically affected by a change in the modulation parameter .",
    "anyway , this local effect is decorrelated from the propagation history",
    ". solar modulation  which is the last energetic modification suffered by an incoming galactic cosmic ray  can thus be treated completely independently from the above analysis .",

    "the results may be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the values of all the inputs being either extracted from the analysis of nuclei ( diffusion parameters @xmath19 , @xmath58 , @xmath64 , @xmath71 and @xmath69 ) or measured ( proton and helium fluxes ) , all the cosmic antiproton fluxes naturally coming out of the calculation are completely contained within the experimental error bars of bess data .",
    "the other strong conclusion is that all possible sources of uncertainties have been derived .",
    "they have been significantly improved with respect to the previous gross estimates .    in particular , those related to propagation range between 10% and 25% , depending on which part of the spectrum is considered , and those related to nuclear physics are below 25 % .",
    "we emphasize that the uncertainties related to propagation will probably be further reduced by a more complete study of cosmic ray nuclei , in particular by focusing on the radioactive species .",
    "we also note that more accurate data on cosmic ray nuclei fluxes would give better constraints on the diffusion parameters , which in turn would translate into lower uncertainties on antiprotons fluxes .",
    "the major remaining uncertainties come from nuclear physics and are already comparable to experimental error bars . as antiproton spectrum measurements",
    "should better in the near future , antiproton studies could be limited by nuclear undeterminacies .",
    "further work and especially new measurements of antiproton production in the p  he channel would be of great interest .",

    "the coefficients @xmath135 are given by @xmath136 notice that the diffusion coefficient @xmath137  that comes into play in the definition of @xmath131 and therefore of @xmath135  essentially depends on the rigidity .",

    "we have assumed here that the energy dependence of that production rate could be disentangled from its distribution @xmath147 along the galactic disk .",
    "the bulk of the secondary antiproton production takes place for a typical energy of the impinging species of @xmath148 gev / n .",
    "note also that the primary fluxes @xmath149 are monotonically decreasing with the energy @xmath53 . both energy losses and diffusive reacceleration",

    "the cosmic  ray flux @xmath150 scales in particular with the global galactic production rate @xmath156 .",
    "this allows to determine the latter by imposing that the interstellar proton and helium fluxes at the solar system do actually match the observations .",
    "forgetting for a while that the inelastic collisions of antiprotons with the interstellar gas may be disentangled into annihilating and non  annihilating interactions , we have to modify relation  ( [ equation_generale ] ) so as to take into account now the energy losses as well as diffusive reacceleration .",
    "this is straightforward since those processes take place only in the disk and not in the halo . once again , following the procedure described in paper i , one gets the differential equation @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 stand respectively for the energy losses and the diffusion in energy .",

    "energy density @xmath118 through equation  ( [ definition_flux ] ) and bessel expanding relation  ( [ tertiary_1 ] ) leads to @xmath162 in the thin disk approximation , that expression needs to be multiplied by @xmath163 .",
    "the bessel transforms @xmath164 of the antiproton density obey now the integro  differential equation @xmath165 notice that in the definition of the coefficients @xmath135 , the rate @xmath121 should now be replaced by @xmath166 where annihilations alone are considered .",
    "the inelastic non ",
    "annihilating reactions are directly dealt with in the tertiary production term @xmath167 .",
    "helium should also be taken into account in our discussion of the annihilations as well as of the inelastic but non  annihilating interactions which antiprotons undergo with interstellar matter . as there are no measurements , we have adopted as an educated guess the geometrical approximation which consists in scaling the appropriate cross - sections by a factor of @xmath168 when we deal with helium . in the formul ( [ tertiary_2 ] ) , ( [ tertiary_2 ] ) and ( [ de cadix ] ) , we have therefore replaced the hydrogen density @xmath169 by @xmath170 .",

    "this translates into the fact that the matrix @xmath193 is close to unity .",
    "we have nevertheless checked that our results remained unchanged when gauss ",
