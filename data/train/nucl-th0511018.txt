    "one of the reasons apart from experimental difficulty is that theoretical approaches employed are not necessarily fit to describe these properties of odd - mass and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "recently , the spherical shell model has become capable of calculating @xmath12 nuclei in the @xmath13 shell .",
    "the shell model calculations reproduce observed energy levels up to high spins in these nuclei and successfully explain shape changes from @xmath14ge to @xmath15se along the even - even @xmath16 line and various particle alignments in even - even nuclei @xcite .",
    "the shell model predicts unexpected alignment in this mass region .",
    "more precisely , @xmath5 one - proton - one - neutron ( @xmath17 ) alignment in the high-@xmath2 @xmath3 orbit takes place not only in odd - odd nuclei but also in even - even nuclei .",
    "in addition , the shell model calculation @xcite revealed possible shape difference between low - lying states in the odd - odd @xmath16 nucleus @xmath18as , predicting a shape isomer .",
    "these calculations suggest that unusual structure observed in even - even @xmath0 nuclei would occur in odd - mass and odd - odd nuclei of this mass region and the reverse also could happen .",
    "a further study of the questions must contribute to elucidation of various features of nuclear structure .    in this paper , we are interested in the question what characteristics appear in odd - mass @xmath0 nuclei .",

    "the calculated @xmath262 state is the @xmath236 aligned state mixed with the @xmath235 aligned state and is a candidate for the @xmath263 member of the band 6 .",

    "moreover , one neutron almost solely occupies the @xmath3 orbit in other positive - parity states with @xmath116 .",
