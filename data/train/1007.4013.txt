    "our objective is to introduce a general class of shape constraints applicable to the estimation of probability densities , multivariate as well as univariate .",
    "elements of the class are represented by restricting certain monotone functions of the density to lie in convex cones .",
    "maximum likelihood estimation of log - concave densities constitutes an important special case ; however , the wider class allows us to include a variety of other shapes .",
    "a one parameter subclass modeled on the means of order @xmath0 studied by @xcite incorporates all the quasi - concave densities , that is , all densities with convex upper contour sets .",
    "estimation methods for these densities , as described below , bring new opportunities for statistical data analysis .",
    "log - concave densities play a crucial role in a wide variety of probabilistic models : in reliability theory , search models , social choice and a broad range of other contexts it has proven convenient to assume densities whose logarithm is concave .",
    "recognition of the importance of log - concavity was already apparent in the work of schoenberg and karlin on total positivity beginning in the late 1940s .",
    "@xcite forged a link between log - concavity and classical statistical properties such as the monotone likelihood ratio property , the theory of sufficient statistics and uniformly most powerful tests .",
    "maximum likelihood estimation of densities constrained to be log - concave has recently enjoyed a considerable vogue with important contributions of walther ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "log - concave densities are constrained to exhibit exponential tail behavior .",
    "this restriction motivates a search for weaker forms of the concavity constraint capable of admitting common densities with algebraic tails like the @xmath1 and @xmath2 families .",
    "the @xmath0-concave densities introduced in section [ s : mle ] constitute a rich source of candidates . while it would be possible , in principle , to consider maximum likelihood estimation of such densities , duality considerations lead us to consider a more general class of maximum entropy criteria . maximizing shannon entropy in the dual",
    "is equivalent to maximum likelihood for the leading log - concave case , but other entropies are also of interest .",
    "section [ s : dual ] describes several examples arising in the dual from the class of rnyi entropies , each corresponding to a distinct specification of the concavity constraint , and each corresponding to a distinct fidelity criterion in the primal .",
    "the crucial advantage of adapting the fidelity criterion to the form of the concavity constraint is that it assures a convex optimization problem with a tractable computational strategy .",
    "a probability density function , @xmath3 , is called _ log - concave _ if @xmath4 is a ( proper ) convex function on the support of @xmath3 .",
    "we adhere to the usual conventions of @xcite , which allow convex functions to take infinite values ",
    "although we will allow only @xmath5 , because all our convex functions will be _ proper_. the _ domain _ of a convex ( concave ) function , @xmath6 , is then the set of @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is finite .",
    "we adopt the convention @xmath9 .",
    "unimodality of concave functions implies that log - concave densities are unimodal .",
    "an interesting connection in the multivariate case was pointed out by @xcite : the number of modes of a kernel density estimate is monotone in the bandwidth when the kernel is log - concave .",
    "however , as illustrated by the student @xmath1 family , not every unimodal density is log - concave .",
    "laplace densities , with their exponential tail behavior , are ; but heavier , algebraic tails are ruled out .",
    "this prohibition motivates a relaxation of the log - concavity requirement .",
    "a natural hierarchy of concave functions can be built on the foundation of the weighted means of order @xmath0 studied by @xcite : for any @xmath10 in the unit simplex , @xmath11 , let @xmath12 for @xmath13 ; the limiting case for @xmath14 is @xmath15 the familiar arithmetic , geometric and harmonic means correspond to @xmath0 equal to @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , a nonnegative , real function  @xmath3 , defined on a convex set @xmath19 is called _ @xmath0-concave _ if for any @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 in this terminology , @xmath23-concave functions are @xmath17-concave and concave functions are @xmath16-concave . as @xmath24 is monotone , increasing in @xmath0 for @xmath25 and any @xmath21 , it follows that if @xmath3 is @xmath0-concave , then @xmath3 is also @xmath26-concave for any @xmath27 . thus , concave functions are @xmath23-concave , but not vice - versa . in the limit @xmath28 ,",
    "concave functions satisfy the condition @xmath29 so they are ( and consequently for all @xmath0-concave functions ) _ quasi - concave_.    the hierarchy of @xmath0-concave density functions was considered in the economics literature by @xcite in spatial models of voting and imperfect competition ; their results reveal some intriguing connections to tukey s half - space depth in multivariate statistics ; see @xcite .",
    "curiously , it appears that the first thorough investigation of the mathematical concept of quasi - concavity was carried out by @xcite .",
    "further details and motivation for @xmath0-concave densities can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath30 is a collection of data points in @xmath31 such that the convex hull of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , has a nonempty interior in @xmath31 ; such a configuration occurs with probability @xmath16 if @xmath34 and the @xmath35 behave like a random sample from @xmath36 , a probability density with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath31 .",
    "viewing the @xmath35 s as a random sample from an unknown , log - concave density @xmath36 , we can find the _",
    "maximum likelihood estimate _ of @xmath36 by solving @xmath37 it is convenient to recast ( [ ! lcmle ] ) in terms of @xmath38 , the estimate becoming @xmath39 , @xmath40 the objective function of ( [ ! lcmlelog ] ) is equal to @xmath5 , given the convention adopted above , unless all @xmath35 are in the domain of @xmath41 . as in @xcite",
    ", it proves convenient to move the integral constraint into the objective function , @xmath42 a device that ensures that the solution integrates to one without enforcing this condition explicitly . apart from the multiplier @xmath43 , the crucial difference between ( [ ! lcmlelog ] ) and ( [ ! warden ] )",
    "is that the latter is a convex problem , while the former not .",
    "it is well known that nave , unrestricted maximum likelihood estimation is doomed to fail when applied in the general density estimation context : once `` log - concave '' is dropped from the formulation of ( [ ! lcmle ] ) , any sequence of putative maximizers is attracted to the the linear combination of point masses situated at the data points .",
    "one escape from this `` dirac catastrophe '' involves regularization by introducing a roughness , or complexity , penalty ; various proposals in this vein can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another way to obtain a well - posed problem is by imposing shape constraints , a line of development dating back to the celebrated @xcite nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for monotone densities .",
    "while monotonicity regularizes the maximum likelihood estimator , unimodality _ per se_somewhat surprisingly  does not .",
    "the desired effect is achieved only by enforcing somewhat more stringent shape constraints  for instance log - concavity , sometimes also called `` strong unimodality . ''",
    "an advantage of shape constraints over regularization based on norm penalties is that it is not encumbered by the need to select additional tuning parameters ; on the other hand , it is limited in scope ",
    "applicable only when the shape constraint is plausible for the unknown density .",
    "expanding the scope of our investigation , we now replace @xmath44 in the integral of the objective function by a generic function @xmath45 and define @xmath46 the following conditions on the form of @xmath47 will be imposed :    * @xmath47 is a nonincreasing , proper convex function on @xmath48 . * the domain of @xmath47 is an open interval containing @xmath49 . *",

    "* @xmath47 is differentiable on the interior of its domain .",
    "* @xmath47 is bounded from below by @xmath17 , with @xmath54 when @xmath55 .",
    "the most crucial condition is ( a1 ) ensuring the convexity of @xmath56 .",
    "condition ( a2 ) assures that @xmath57 is finite for all @xmath58 , while ( a3 ) is required in the proof of the existence of the estimates .",
    "the relationship between primal and dual formulations of the estimation problem is facilitated by ( a4 ) , and ( a5 ) rules out possible complications regarding the existence of the integral @xmath59 in ( [ ! probj ] ) , allowing for the convention @xmath60 .",
    "in the spirit of the lebesgue integration theory , the integral then _ exists _ , although @xmath45 does not have to be _ summable _ : it is either finite [ which is automatically true for any @xmath41 convex and @xmath61 or @xmath5 . in the latter case ,",
    "the objective function @xmath62 is considered to be equal to @xmath5 ; @xmath62 is also @xmath5 if @xmath63 for some @xmath35 , which occurs unless all @xmath35 lie in the domain of @xmath41 . on the other hand , any @xmath41 equal to some positive constant on @xmath33 and @xmath5",
    "elsewhere yields @xmath64 .    a rigorous treatment without assumption ( a5 ) ,",
    "that is , for functions @xmath47 not bounded below , would introduce technicalities involving handling of the integrals in the spirit of singular integrals of calculus of variations , a strategy resembling the contrivance of @xcite of subtracting a fixed quantity from the objective function to ensure finiteness of the integral .",
    "although we do not believe that such formal complications are unsurmountable , we do not pursue such a development .",
    "careful deliberation reveals that replacing @xmath41 by its closure ( lower semicontinuous hull ) does not change the integral term in ( [ ! probj ] ) , and potentially only decreases the first term ; this means that without any restriction of its scope , we may reformulate the estimation problem as @xmath65 where @xmath66 stands for the class of closed ( lower semicontinuous ) convex functions on @xmath31 .",
    "unlike in ( [ ! warden ] ) , @xmath45 is not necessarily the estimated density @xmath3 ; the relationship of @xmath41 to @xmath3 will be revealed in section [ s : dual ] , together with the motivation leading to concrete instances of some possible functions @xmath47 .",
    "we now establish that the estimates , the solutions of ( [ ! dumb ] ) , admit a finite - dimensional characterization , which is a key to many of their theoretical properties . for every collection @xmath67 of points @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we define a function @xmath70 any function of this type is finitely generated in the sense of @xcite , whose corollary 19.1.2 asserts that it is polyhedral , being the maximum of finitely many affine functions , and therefore convex .",

    "any function @xmath41 from @xmath78 determines a unique discretely convex vector @xmath82 .",

    "the theorem shows that it is sufficient to seek potential solutions of ( [ ! dumb ] ) in @xmath78 ; this means , due to the one ",
    "one correspondence of the latter to @xmath87 , that the optimization task ( [ ! dumb ] ) is essentially finite dimensional .",
    "the theorem also justifies the transition to a more convenient optimization domain in the primal formulation appearing in the next section .",
    "the conjugate dual formulation of the primal estimation problem ( [ ! dumb ] ) conveys a maximum entropy interpretation and leads us to several concrete proposals for @xmath47 . to conform to existing mathematical apparatus",

    "@xcite have recently implemented a promising steepest descent algorithm for multivariate log - concave estimation that may be adaptable to other quasi - concave density estimation problems .      to illustrate the application of the foregoing methods , we briefly consider some realistic examples .",
    "our first example features data similar to those considered by @xcite , the type of data where shape constraints sometimes arise in a natural manner .",
    "the two samples consist of 9092 measurements of radial and 3933 of rotational velocity for the stars from bright star catalog , @xcite .",

    "the broken line in the upper panels shows kernel density estimates , each time with default matlab bandwith selection ; the solid lines correspond to one of the norm penalized estimates proposed in @xcite : maximum likelihood penalized by the total variation of the second derivative of the logarithm of the estimated density .",
    "this is the @xmath191 version of the silverman s ( @xcite ) estimator penalizing the squared @xmath192 norm of the third derivative .",
    "the smoothing parameter for the latter estimate was set quite arbitrarily at @xmath16 ; it seems that this arbitrary choice works quite satisfactorily here , providing  somewhat surprisingly , for both samples  about the same level of smoothing as the kernel estimator . for the radial velocity sample ,",
    "the two estimates are essentially the same . for the rotational velocity sample",
    ", however , the right upper panel shows that the kernel density estimate differs substantially from the penalized one .",
    "both estimators have the unfortunate effect of assigning considerable mass to negative values despite the fact that there are no negative observations .",
    "this effect is somewhat more pronounced for the kernel estimate .",
    "since the preliminary analyses of the upper panels indicates that the hypothesis of unimodality is plausible for both of the datasets , a natural next step is the application of a shape - constrained estimator  a move that , among other things , may relieve us of insecurities related to the arbitrary choice of smoothing parameters . the broken line in the lower panels of figure [ figstars ] shows the log - concave maximum likelihood ( @xmath193 ) , and the solid line the hellinger ( @xmath155-concave ) estimate ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "while , as expected , there is almost no difference between the two ( and in fact , among all four ) estimates for the radial velocity dataset , the right lower panel reveals that the log - concave estimate yields for the rotational velocity sample a density that is monotonically decreasing  which contradicts the evidence suggested by all other methods .",
    "the hellinger estimate , on the other hand , exhibits a subtle , but visible bump at the location of the plausible mode , thus turning out to be visually more informative about the center of the data than the tails .",
    "this is somewhat paradoxical given its original heavy - tail motivation , confirming that the real universe of data analysis can be much more subtle than that of the surrounding theoretical constructs .",
    "to illustrate our approach in a simple bivariate setting , we reconsidered the well - known @xcite data on the heights and left middle finger lengths of 3000 british criminals .",

    "the maximum likelihood estimate of the log - concave model in figure [ fig8 ] has very similar central contours , but the outer contours fall off much more rapidly implying that the log - concave estimate assigns much smaller probability to the region near the unusual point .",

    "there are many unexplored directions for future research . as we have seen , a consequence of the variational formulation of our concavity constraints is that the estimated densities vanish off the convex hull of the data .",
    "various treatments for this malady may be suggested .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested applying one of several estimators of the pareto tail index to the smoothed ordinates from the log - concave preliminary density estimator . our inclination would be to prefer solutions that impose further regularization on the initial problem .",
    "thus , for example , we can add a new penalty term to the primal problem , penalizing the total variation of the derivative ( gradient ) of @xmath206 , and choosing a suitable value of the associated lagrange multiplier to smooth the tail behavior at the boundary .",
    "we have adhered , thus far , to the principle that the entropy choice in the fidelity criterion of the dual problem should dictate the form of the convexity constraint : likelihood thus implies log - concavity , hellinger fidelity implies @xmath207 concavity , etc .",

    "problems ( [ equp ] ) and ( [ equd ] ) are strongly dual in the sense of the following result , which may viewed as the discrete counterpart of theorem  [ t : dual ] .    if @xmath47 is convex and differentiable on the interior @xmath354 of its domain , then the corresponding solutions of ( [ equp ] ) and ( [ equd ] ) satisfy    @xmath355    whenever the elements of g are from @xmath354 and the elements of @xmath3 are from the image of @xmath354 under @xmath356 .",
    "for @xmath357 with typical element @xmath358 we have @xmath247 with elements @xmath359 , so the dual problem corresponding to maximum likelihood can be interpreted as maximizing the shannon entropy of the estimated density subject to the constraints appearing in ( [ equd ] ) . since @xmath41 was interpreted in ( [ equp ] ) as @xmath206 , this result justifies our interpretation of solutions of ( [ equd ] ) as densities provided that they satisfy our integrability condition .",
    "this is easily verified and thus justifies the implicit lagrange multiplier of one on the integrability constraint in ( [ equp ] ) , giving a discrete counterpart of theorem [ t : dual ] .",

    "then solutions @xmath351 of ( [ equd ] ) satisfy @xmath363 and @xmath364 .",
    "the crucial element of the proof is that the differencing operator d annihilates the constant vector and therefore the result extends immediately to other norm - type penalties as well as to the other entropy objectives that we have discussed . indeed , since the second difference operator representing our convexity constraint annihilates any affine function it follows by the same argument that the mean of the estimated density also coincides with the sample mean of the observed @xmath35 s .",
