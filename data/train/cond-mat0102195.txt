    "[ fig3](b ) , using the simplest possible phenomenological postulate and geometrical arguments ( equivalent to van der waals and other classical theories ) .",
    "he concluded that the degree of tangency was controlled by a @xmath65 power law ( in place of a power 2 for a normal analytic tangency ) .",
    "later klinger , @xcite using a more general phenomenological classical theory , discussed the _ critical _ endpoint binodals , @xmath66 and @xmath67 analytically : see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . however , he found no evidence of singular behavior . beyond that , klinger confirmed the leading @xmath65 power in the _",
    "non_critical or spectator binodal and found that the first correction term carries a @xmath68 power .    on general grounds , however , it seems certain that the powers @xmath65 and @xmath68 must result from the reliance on classical theory which entails the critical exponent values @xmath69 , @xmath37 , and @xmath70 in place of the appropriate nonclassical values @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 which characterize the specific heat , coexistence curve , and critical isotherm of real bulk , ( @xmath74)-dimensional fluids ( or other systems in the ising universality class ) .",
    "indeed , widom has conjectured @xcite that in general the @xmath65 power should become @xmath75 .",
    "this reduces to borzi s result when @xmath76 but yields an exponent value 1.207 for real fluid systems .    here",
    "we confirm widom s surmise using the full scaling approach developed in * i*. furthermore we show that klinger s correction exponent of @xmath68 is replaced , more generally , by _ three _ exponents , namely , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 is the leading correction - to - scaling exponent which has the value @xmath81 for @xmath17-dimensional ising - type systems ; @xcite thus these three exponents have values of about 1.42 , 1.55 and 1.57 , respectively , for bulk fluids . in the classical limit",
    "attained via @xmath82 one has @xmath83 and the second exponent reduces @xcite to @xmath65 while the first and third yield klinger s value @xmath68 .",
    "however , we also identify further singular exponents that must appear in the expansion of the noncritical binodal at the endpoint .",
    "it transpires , in addition , that , contrary to klinger s findings , @xcite the critical binodal is , in general , _ also singular _ with a leading power @xmath84 so that the binodal is much flatter at the endpoint @xmath57 than classical theory would predict . here , and below where appropriate , we suppose @xmath85 as applies to real fluids .",
    "the exponent @xmath14 is , in fact , the same as that long known to characterize isothermal binodals passing through a lambda point ( away from any endpoint ) : see @xmath86 and @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "this behavior which is , of course , reconfirmed by our analysis reflects , in turn , the phenomenon of critical exponent renormalization .",
    "@xcite the correction terms in the critical endpoint binodal are found to carry exponents @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "when one substitutes the classical values @xmath69 and @xmath90 these leading and correction exponents become 2 , 3 , 4 , @xmath4 which are consistent with klinger s results and indicative of a fully analytic critical binodal .    the results sketched here , and others for the remaining binodals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , are presented in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . however , it is necessary to point out that figs .",
    "[ fig1]-3 are special in two respects .",
    "first , as mentioned , no symmetry with respect to the ordering surface @xmath26 has been supposed : this is quite appropriate for most fluid systems .",
    "however , as observed in * i * , @xcite there are many other physical systems in which the thermodynamic potentials are unchanged under reflection in the _ plane _ @xmath26 : one may then take @xmath91 on @xmath26 and the symmetry becomes invariance under @xmath92 .",
    "the conceptually simplest example is an elemental ferromagnet , like nickel or iron , where @xmath93 is the magnetic field and @xmath94 , the pressure .",
    "other examples are ferroelectrics , antiferromagnets , order - disorder binary alloys , and liquid helium through its transition to superfluidity ; @xcite however , the binodal curves are not readily accessible experimentally in some of these cases .",
    "the corresponding @xmath28 phase space , the isothermal sections , and the binodal curves for such _ symmetric critical endpoints _ are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ,  [ fig5 ] , and  [ fig6 ] .",
    "in fact , symmetric critical endpoints are simpler in a number of respects and will be analyzed first below .",
    "fundamentally we find that the leading singular behavior of the binodals is identical in the symmetric and nonsymmetric cases but the correction terms differ in character : see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] .    a second special feature embodied in figs .",
    "[ fig1]-3 is the _ slope _ of the @xmath16 line which we characterize as _ negative _ in the sense that if , without loss of generality , we ( i ) take @xmath95 _ and _ ( ii ) suppose that the negative @xmath23 axis lies in the @xmath0 or spectator - phase ( see figs",
    ". 1 and 4 ) then we have @xcite @xmath96 conversely , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , one must also consider the case of a positively sloping @xmath16 line with @xmath97 as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] , this produces distinct isothermal phase diagrams and new arrangements of binodal curves : note the additional notation introduced in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "one might , of course , also wish to consider the borderline cases @xmath98 , @xmath99 ; we will not pursue these but , on the basis of our postulates for the thermodynamic potentials as set out below in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the necessary analysis presents no further problems of principle .    in summary",
    "therefore , we will analyze the binodals for four types of critical endpoints which , using * n * for nonsymmetric and * s * for symmetric , may be labeled * na * ( figs .",
