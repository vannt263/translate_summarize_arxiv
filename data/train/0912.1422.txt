    "detailed information about the bulk compositions of planetary bodies is generally limited by the lack of available mechanisms to probe planet interiors .",
    "however , the technique of measuring accreted element abundances of tidally disrupted planetary bodies that pollute the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs provides an indirect , yet sensitive method to study bulk compositions .",
    "the otherwise pure white dwarf atmospheres are a clear canvas for displaying the relative bulk elemental abundances of the swallowed planetary parent body / bodies , as demonstrated with keck / hires observations , and subsequent abundance analyses , of the dramatically polluted white dwarf gd 362 ( zuckerman et al .",

    "in contrast to main sequence stars whose atmospheres contain mainly primordial elements , cool ( 6,000 k @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 25,000 k ) white dwarfs provide a relatively clean slate since their high surface gravities cause heavy elements to settle downward , leaving above a nearly pure hydrogen and/or helium atmosphere ( schatzman 1945 ) . the settling times for `` high - z '' ( atomic # z @xmath3 2 ) elements to diffuse down from the outer convection zone are always short compared to the white dwarf lifetime ( paquette et al .",
    "1986 ) , and thus the high - z elements can not be primordial . the competing outward force of radiative levitation is negligible below 25,000 k ( chayer et al . 1995 ) , and convective carbon dredge - up , which may play a role in bringing carbon to the surface for @xmath2 @xmath1 13,000 k ( koester et al .",
    "1982 ) , can not explain the presence of heavier elements .",
    "consequently , high - z atmospheric contaminants in cool white dwarfs must be accreted from an external source .",
    "given the purity of white dwarf ( wd ) atmospheres , even trace amounts of external pollutants can be detected spectroscopically , especially with high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) observations .    while heavy element absorption features have been detected in spectra of single wds for over half a century ( kuiper 1941 ; see also sion et al.@xmath41983 ; wesemael et al.@xmath41993 for current wd classifications and references ) , it is relatively recent that the growing number of discoveries of infrared excess emission ( due to light - reprocessing by the dust of a circumstellar disk ) at many of the most heavily polluted wds has elucidated the nature of the accretion reservoirs ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ; becklin et al .",

    "2006 , 2007 , 2008 ) . given the location , the dust and gas must have been produced ( or delivered ) after the stars red giant phase .",

    "2007b , 2009b , reach et al . 2005 , 2009 ) , which can be modeled by micron - sized olivine - like glasses that produce a characteristic emission profile resembling that of circumstellar , but not interstellar grains .",
    "evidence is strong that these disks are derived from the tidal disruption of an asteroid or minor planet ( see jura 2008 ) which has undergone orbital perturbation ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 ) during post - red giant evolution of the star s planetary system .",
    "the material in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs with detected disks has almost certainly been accreted from their circumstellar reservoirs .",
    "the atmospheric contaminant abundances are linked to the composition of the accreted source material ( koester 2009a ) .",

    "much of the echelle blaze function was removed by dividing each spectrum by a low - order polynomial fit to the extracted spectrum of the quartz lamp flat exposure .",
    "it was desirable to increase the signal - to - noise ratio by combining orders of overlapping wavelength coverage , and to reduce the known hires artifacts ( waves and bends in the continuum of a wavelength scale greater than @xmath1210  ) most likely due to variable vignetting ( suzuki et al . 2003 ) . since we do not require absolute flux calibrated information , and we are mainly interested in heavy - element absorption lines ( equivalent widths @xmath1 3  ) , the echelle orders were continuum normalized to unity with a low - order polynomial ( typically 5th order cubic spline ) to reduce artifacts and align the echelle orders .",
    "an error associated with this action was estimated by varying the order of the normalization polynomial , which resulted in a @xmath17 1% variation in equivalent width measurements of typical heavy element absorption lines .",
    "adjacent orders of overlapping wavelength coverage were combined in an average , weighted by the blaze function to suppress the contribution from the noisier edges of the ccd chip ( e.g. aoki 2006 ) , and a final order - merged , normalized spectrum was obtained .",
    "we employed different instrumental setups to achieve our desired wavelength coverage and sensitivity . for the 2008 red data , an additional re - normalizing processing step had to be applied to calibrate and remove 2nd ( diffraction ) order blue flux contamination in the region @xmath108200 - 9000 .",

    "our synthetic spectrum reproduces the observed absorption spectrum ( see figures 1  8) , and we compare the ews of the model lines with those measured in the data .",
    "the ew measurements are translated into abundance values relative to helium by interpolation between models with different relative abundances . in a representative curve - of - growth plot of the si ii @xmath103862.6 line in gd 40 ( see figure 10 ) , the ew versus abundance relation is well defined . for each element ,",

    "this gives nearly the same result as weighting by the inverse square of propagated measurement errors .",
    "for each set of high - z element lines , the standard deviation of the mean ( sdom ) of the set of abundances are in the range 0.03 - 0.09 dex , which always exceeds ( by 50 - 200% ) the measurement error propagated from ew uncertainties .",
    "this is expected since systematic errors enter in going from ew to abundance .",
    "we take the sdom as the `` formal '' error of the abundance average . to be conservative in estimating our errors we include the difference between weighted and unweighted averages as an additional contribution to the uncertainty . finally , we varied the model parameters by their uncertainties , @xmath2 ( 15,300 @xmath0 500 k ) and log @xmath15 ( 8.0 @xmath0 0.3 ) , one at a time , to calculate a per - element abundance error associated with the model temperature and gravity uncertainties , respectively . in table 3",
    "we list the derived abundances and uncertainties , relative to helium , for the 9 detected contaminants and we place useful upper limits on al and ni , as well as 6 additional elements . for the abundances",
    "relative to helium , the @xmath2 uncertainty is usually the dominant source of error , as can be readily seen from table 3 .    with a precision of @xmath12 0.1  0.2 dex , our work reduces the abundance uncertainties for previously identified elements , mg , si , and ca , by at least a factor of 5 . for mg , si , ca and fe , our new abundances are all lower than the nominal values in f99w02 by @xmath12 30 - 40 % , which for mg , si , and ca are within the errors ( see figure 11 ) .",
    "differences in model temperatures used for this analysis ( 15,300 k ) and f99w02 ( 15,150 k ) are not the cause of the systematic abundance offset , since at lower @xmath2 the implied abundances are even smaller .",
    "the hires detection of h@xmath21 ( ew = 0.23  ) agrees with the spy data .",
    "however , based on an h@xmath21 ew measurement of 1.0 @xmath4(greenstein & liebert , 1990 ) , f99w02 obtained a hydrogen abundance nearly an order of magnitude higher than the hires and spy results .",
    "in retrospect , the feature assigned to h@xmath21 ( see figure 1b of greenstein & liebert , 1990 ) was noise . from their possible uv detection of al , friedrich et al.@xmath4(1999 ) suggest log[n(al)/n(he ) ] = -7.15 , just below our detection limit of log[n(al)/n(he ) ] @xmath1 -7.1 . in our composition analysis",
    "we include the small , but relevant contributions from ni and al using the hires - derived upper limits on their abundances .    in principle , @xmath2",
    "can also be evaluated from the abundance agreement between different ionization states of an element , since we expect a consistent value for the total number of atoms of the element .",
    "both mg and fe display lines from two different ionic states , mg i / mg ii and fe i / fe ii .",
    "the separated abundances for the different ionic states and varied model input temperatures are shown in figures 12 and 13 .",
    "although the mean deviations of the abundances are close to the differences between the average values , it is possible to distinguish between models with different temperatures . for both mg and fe ,",
    "the ionization balance is improved at the lower temperature limit , and degraded at the higher temperature limit . also , the ionized species always reflects a lower abundance than the neutral atoms , likewise suggesting the model temperature is too high . with our presentation of the uncertainties in table 3 , it is straightforward to recover all the element abundances , to within @xmath120.05 dex , that result from the model with @xmath2 = 14,800 k ( if ever in the future this becomes established ) , from the table 3 data by subtracting the @xmath2 uncertainty from the abundances listed in column 2 . similarly , the 15,800 k abundances can be re - calculated by raising all the column 2 abundances up by the @xmath2 uncertainty",
    ". such potential shifts in model temperature do not significantly alter our results of the relative elemental abundances in the parent body causing gd 40 s atmospheric pollution .",
    "this is because the abundances of polluting elements all move together , either down or up , with varying @xmath2 ; the pollutant - to - pollutant ratios are less sensitive to the model temperature than are the pollutant - to - helium ratios .",
    "how do these abundances help us understand extrasolar planetary systems ?      first we note that gd 40 has accreted at least the mass of a large asteroid . with a helium - dominated convective zone ( cvz ) that contains a fraction @xmath25 = log ( @xmath26 ) = -5.86 ( koester 2009a ) of the white dwarf s total mass of 0.59 @xmath24 ,",

    "it is immediately apparent how gd 40 s volatile - poor abundances are very different from primitive solar system abundances , and we find the closest agreement with an earth - like composition .",
    "94% of earth s mass comes from just 4 elements : o , mg , si , and fe ( allegre et al . 1995 ) .",
    "ca , ni and al contribute another @xmath12 5% , and all other elements are minor constituents .",
    "similarly , by bulk mass , the material polluting gd 40 s atmosphere is 88% o , mg , si , and fe .",
    "ca contributes another 6% .",
    "upper limits for the cvz mass percentages of al ( 2.5% ) and ni ( 1.3% ) have been included in the totals .",
    "jura ( 2006 ) and farihi et al . (",
    "2009 ) have pointed out that , for a handful of polluted wds with carbon measurements , including gd 40 , the polluting abundance of carbon relative to iron is down by a factor of 6 or more from the solar ratio .",
    "the deficiencies of carbon and hydrogen are consistent with rocky matter . by similar arguments as apply for gd 362 , which have been described in detail by zuckerman et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , based on the quantity and constitution of pollutants , an interstellar or cometary origin for the high - z elements is `` exceedingly unlikely '' .",
    "the origin of the hydrogen is less certain because unlike the high - z elements , it does not settle below the outer convective zone , which results in an accumulation of all the primordial and accreted hydrogen over the wd lifetime .",
    "both voss et al . (",
    "2007 ) and dufour et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find a trend of increasing hydrogen mass with increasing age in helium - dominated wds which argues strongly in favor of an accreted , rather than primordial , origin .",
    "gd 40 s hydrogen abundance is consistent with these populations of helium - dominated wds ( figure 1 of jura et al .",
    "since we do not have a constraint on its arrival epoch , it is possible that some , or maybe all , of the presently observed hydrogen is a result of previous accretion of other planetary matter ( whose high - z components have settled ) , or due to accretion from the interstellar medium , and may not even be associated with the most recently accreted material .",
    "alternatively , some , or possibly all , of gd 40 s hydrogen could be tied to the currently observed heavy element pollution .",
    "at best we can place some upper limits .",
    "one path by which hydrogen may survive processes that result in a refractory - rich environment is through h@xmath31o .",
    "jura & xu ( 2009 ) propose that water from accreted minor planets may have a role in the hydrogen `` pollutions '' of helium - dominated wds . our measured hydrogen abundance ( at its upper error limit )",
    "imposes an upper limit to the amount of water or ice which could have been accreted ( in total for gd 40 s entire wd cooling time ) at 3.6 @xmath27 10@xmath32 g. if all of this water was accreted along with the present high - z material , then an upper limit to the amount of water in the bulk pollutant composition is 10% .",
    "we show below , in @xmath164.3 , that due to settling of the heavier elements , the upper limit is likely to be much less than this . in either case gd 40",
    "has not accreted a very large amount of water , or hydrogen , along with its high - z material .",
    "gd 40 s atmospheric pollution is consistent with having accreted rocky material .",
    "however , the atmospheric abundances , n(z)/n(he ) , need not be the same as the accreted abundances , and going from the measured abundances to the accreted ones requires some insight and modeling .",
    "the relationship between observed and accreted abundances is governed by the interplay of accretion and diffusion .",
    "key inputs are the characteristics of the encounter with the reservoir , the rate that matter is falling into the star and the rates by which heavy elements are settling ( diffusing ) downward .",
    "fundamentals of accretion ",
    "diffusion theory have been described in detail by dupuis et al ( 1993 ) .",
    "more recently , koester & wilken ( 2006 ) and koester ( 2009a ) have quantified mixing zone mass fractions and settling times of commonly accreted elements for a variety of white dwarf atmospheres in the temperature range of interest .",
    "table 4 lists settling times , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 diffusion time , @xmath35 in koester 2009a ) , calculated specifically for gd 40 s cvz .",
    "following the models of jura et al ( 2009a ) and koester ( 2009a ) , accretion is occuring from the observed disk of material and may be represented by an exponentially decaying mass function with a characteristic lifetime , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 in koester 2009a ) .",
    "we are observing the system at a time @xmath38 , which we would like to constrain , with respect to @xmath39 and @xmath36 . while exact relations governing the abundance ratios can be found from equation 8 of koester ( 2009a ) and equation 8 of jura et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , here we summarize the characteristics of three limiting cases : ( 1 ) in the early phase of accretion , @xmath40 , the accreted abundance ratios are directly the observed atmospheric ones .",
    "( 2 ) for times on the order of the diffusion time scales a steady state is approached , and if the reservoir is long - lived , @xmath41 , the steady state values of the accreted abundances are modified from the measured abundances by the ratios of the settling times ( equation 7 of koester 2009a , equivalently equation 16 of jura et al .",
    "2009a ) :    @xmath42    the ratios of settling times are at most a factor of 2.6 between detected elements studied in this work .",
    "( 3 ) after the accretion reservoir is spent , @xmath43 , the atmospheric element ratios deviate exponentially with time from the accreted ratios , as gravitational settling causes the heavier elements to sink more rapidly than the lighter ones .",
    "this case leads to a significant departure from the accreted abundances .    referring to gd 40 cvz abundances shown in figure 15",
    ", the high - z ratios do not differ from the earth or ci chondrite ratios by more than a factor of 4 , ( except for carbon ) , mostly the factor is 1 - 2 as is the case for o , mg , ti , cr , mn and fe .",
    "this is not at all the exponential deviations between observed and accreted abundances that are expected from gravitational settling if accretion has ended , paused , or significantly decreased .",
    "also , there is no trend of increasing depletion of element abundances ( relative to earth or chondrite abundances ) with decreasing element settling times .",
    "thus , the relative atmospheric abundances are consistent with accretion being presently ongoing , which is further supported by the observational existence of a disk .",
    "this implies that we are either observing gd 40 in a steady state , at an early phase of accretion , or somewhere in between .",
    "figures 14 and 15 depict these two limiting extremes of the accreted abundances",
    ".      the earth - like composition of gd 40 s pollutants is almost certainly not coincidental , but rather , it is probably linked to the stoichiometric balance of rock - forming oxides . in the solar system rocky planetary bodies are primarily composed of mineral oxides ( mgo , al@xmath31o@xmath44 , sio@xmath31 , cao , tio@xmath31 , cr@xmath31o@xmath44 , mno , feo , fe@xmath31o@xmath44 , nio , and minor constituents ) and possibly metals , e.g. fe , ni , cr , etc , particularly if a core has formed .",
    "it is a remarkable result that the quantities of heavy elements in gd 40 s atmosphere are consistent with a rocky composition wherein heavy elements are largely contained within oxides . in other words , the observed oxygen is of sufficient quantity to form minerals with the other observed elements , as is evident from computing the number of oxygen atoms needed to form oxides , z@xmath45o@xmath46 , ( measured relative to he ) :    @xmath47    with table 3 observed element ( z ) abundances , which directly represent early - phase accretion as defined in @xmath164.2 , equation 2 adds up roughly to 1.5 @xmath27 10@xmath48 , significantly below the measured oxygen abundance , n(o)/n(he ) = 2.5 @xmath27 10@xmath48 .",
    "additionally , as discussed in @xmath164.1 , some of the oxygen may be associated with water / ice , since a portion , or possibly all , of the atmospheric hydrogen could be coeval with the current accretion episode .",
    "constrained by the relatively low hydrogen abundance , at most 0.5 @xmath27 10@xmath48 of the observed n(o)/n(he ) can originate from water .",
    "now we have the question of accounting for all the excess oxygen , since the refractory - rich , volatile - poor element abundances imply that unbound , volatile oxygen is not a likely vehicle .",
    "what happens in the steady state ? in order to calculate the steady state abundances from equation 1 , pollutant - to - pollutant ratios are needed .",
    "we list early phase and steady state abundance ratios , relative to oxygen , in table 5 . to evaluate the oxygen budget , let s look at the oxide balance in greater detail .",
    "as is suitable for a rocky parent body , we assume oxygen is mainly carried in oxides or water . removing the helium dependence of equation 2 and working with the oxygen ratios , a balanced oxygen budget requires :    @xmath49    we use @xmath50 to represent the undetermined fraction of the observed hydrogen that is associated with water in the parent body causing the current accretion .",
    "another ambiguity comes from the fact that there are three principle states of iron in the earth : metallic fe ( as in earth s core ) , feo , and fe@xmath31o@xmath44 , but in the white dwarf s atmosphere we are measuring the sum of fe atoms from all states . since we do not have a clear determination of the partitioning of fe in the gd 40 parent body , in table 5 we show sums for 3 different distributions of fe in order to better understand the range of effects on the oxide balance .",
    "iron is potentially one of the main carriers of oxygen , and in order to account for the observed o abundance , we find that the fe can not be all metallic . from the steady state oxide balance , we need at least 45% of the iron atoms in feo ( at least 30% if the more oxygen - rich species , fe@xmath31o@xmath44 , is the principle state ) in order to carry the oxygen .",
    "this constraint means that by total mass the accreted material was likely less than 28% metallic iron .",
    "referring to the oxygen budget of table 5 , if one includes all of the hydrogen as water and assumes that all of the iron is in the more oxygenated form , fe@xmath31o@xmath44 ( no metallic fe ) , then , even at the upper limit of the uncertainty , the fraction of oxygen accounted for by early accretion phase abundances gets close to , but does not quite add up to 1 .",
    "in other words , the parent body abundances that would be associated with early phase accretion have too much oxygen compared to what can be carried by high - z elements and water .",
    "a more likely scenario is that accretion has been going on long enough for the system to be in a steady state with heavier elements settling more rapidly than the oxygen .",
    "indeed , we see in table 5 , the steady state abundances are in balance with respect to oxides ( i.e. the oxygen budget adds up to unity ) , and in this configuration , the problem of too much oxygen in the parent body disappears .",
    "we learn from this exercise that the oxide balance favors the steady state accretion situation ( represented by the steady state bulk composition in figure 14 and the steady state abundances in figure 15 , with element - to - element ratios derivable from the steady state column of table 5 ) . in order for the system to achieve a steady state , the disk lifetime , must be longer than the settling time scales @xmath51 yr . by these arguments ,",
    "a lower bound on gd 40 s disk lifetime is @xmath52 years . with gd 40 in , or near , an accretion  diffusion steady state , then after just a few settling times , the total accreted mass would be @xmath12 a few @xmath27 10@xmath53 g , or about the mass of vesta , the second most massive asteroid in our solar system ( konopliv et al .",
    "we have constrained @xmath54 , but we do not know how many settling times have passed . also , since the disk is opaque ( jura et al .",
    "2007a ) we can not estimate its mass , so we do not know how much more mass may be waiting to accrete from there .",
    "returning to the question of water content in the parent body , since we have argued in favor of accretion taking place for at least a couple of settling times , then in the steady state , an upper limit to the percent of water by mass is 3% , decreasing nearly linearly with @xmath55 ( equation 6 of jura et al .",
    "the water content of a planetary body can be a distinctive measure . by mass , the earth s mantle , ceres and callisto are 0.03  0.1% , 25% , and 50% water , respectively ( van thienen et al .",
    "2007 , mccord & sotin 2005 , canup & ward 2002 , respectively ) .",
    "meteorites originating from the outer asteroid belt ( 2.54 au ) are up to 10% water by mass , while those originating from the inner asteroid belt ( @xmath12 2 au ) range from 0.050.1% water by mass ( morbidelli et al . 2000 ) .",
    "gd 40 has a disk within its tidal radius , circumstellar silicate dust emission , the mass of a large asteroid in its convective zone , and pollutant abundances consistent with rocky material .",
    "the most plausible origin of the atmospheric heavy elements is a tidally disrupted planetary parent body , such as an asteroid / minor planet . presumably , this object was part of an ancient planetary system , had its orbit perturbed ( debes & sigurdsson 2002 ) , such that it journeyed within the star s tidal radius and was disrupted ( jura 2003 ) , forming a disk of material that is accreting onto the star .    in figure 15",
    "the element abundances are shown normalized to the primitive material ci chondrites to assist our interpretation of how the gd 40 parent body may have evolved from a primitive constitution .",
    "we see an overall trend of increasing abundances with increasing condensation temperature indicative of thermal processing .",
    "the close agreement with bulk earth values for o , mg , cr , mn , and fe anchors the earth - like abundance nature of the polluting body , permitting us to interpret the deviations , most notably the depletion of silicon and the build up of refractory elements , in terms of evolutionary processes .    a distinctive result we find is n(si)/n(mg ) = 0.30 @xmath0 0.11 in significant contrast to the ratio near unity for the bulk earth , the sun , chondrites , and nearby stars .",
    "this is not part of the pattern of the thermal trend , nor can it be caused by differential gravitational settling , since si and mg have nearly the same diffusion times ( see also figure 15 ) .",
    "our result is consistent with the f99w02 value of n(si)/n(mg ) = 0.3@xmath56 . in this paper , we have reduced the uncertainties over previous work enough to recognize that the primordial elemental mix in this evolved planetary system has been altered within the parent body .",
    "figure 16 depicts the distinction from cosmic abundances .",
    "the gd 40 star and proto - planetary - system was probably not born with a peculiar si / mg ratio .",
    "presently no solar system object has an observed si / mg abundance with such a low ratio .",
    "perhaps the closest comparison to a measured material in our own solar system comes from the pallasite meteorites , which are thought to derive from the mantle - core boundary of a differentiated body ( i.e. physically stratified into mantle , core , and/or crust ) , and measure n(si)/n(mg ) = 0.6 ( buseck 1977 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the distinctive si / mg ratio may be associated with mantle / crust differentiation , in which si was concentrated in a crust , and mg in a mantle , and the crust was later lost .",
    "evidence for eroding collisions exists in our solar system in the form of the moon and the diversity of the population of asteroids and meteorites such as the pallasites . the so - called hit - and - run process ( asphaug et al .",
    "2006 ) , thought to play a role in terrestrial planet formation , results in increasingly exotic characteristics for the unaccreted remnants of planetesimal collisions .",
    "if differentiation takes place in a planetary body , si - rich minerals tend to rise into the crust , whereas mg - rich minerals prefer the mantle . in earth s",
    "crust n(si)/n(mg ) = 11 , but in a large rocky planetary body such as earth , the 35 km crust is a relatively thin layer and the mantle / crust mass ratio is 169:1 .",
    "thus , even though si is highly concentrated in the crust , a relatively small amount by mass has been depleted from the earth s mantle . in an asteroid sized body , such as vesta ( radius = 270 km ) ,",
    "the crust is thought to be @xmath1227 km , and a mantle / crust mass ratio has been estimated at 3:1 ( ghosh & mcsween 1998 , jones 1984 ) , making a substantial mg and si differentiation in an asteroid plausible .    a difficulty of this explanation is with the observed enhancements of ca , ti , and possibly al in gd 40 .",
    "similar to silicon , the elements ca , ti and al also tend to concentrate in the crust of a differentiated body .",
    "for instance , si , ca , ti , and al are respectively , 1.3 , 1.8 , 3.4 and 3.5 times more abundant in earth s crust than in earth s mantle ( palme & oneill 2007 ) .",
    "if gd 40 s parent body lost its crust , then should not ca , ti and al also be depleted along with si ?",
    "something else must be going on . since ca , ti and al are refractory , most likely their enhancements are attributable to a significant thermal process . indeed , earth s mantle , while depleted in si relative to primitive ci chondrites , is modestly enhanced in ca , ti and al ( see table 6 ) , notably due to the refractory lithophile nature of these elements . given the strong enhancements of ca and ti in gd 40 s polluting planetary body",
    ", it likely experienced a more extreme thermal history than earth , as may have come about for example from intense heating during the red giant phase or through the energy of collisions .",
    "another consideration is that exposure to high temperatures during planetary formation and/or evolution could be important . with an estimated wd mass of 0.59 @xmath24 for gd 40 ,",
    "its main sequence progenitor was likely greater than 1.5 @xmath24 ( weidemann 2000 ) . as previously suggested by jura et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , the circumstellar environments around stars more massive than our sun may support conditions of more intense heating of the protoplanetary material , planetesimals and planets than in the solar nebula , which could explain the dramatically high abundances of calcium polluting the white dwarfs gd 362 and gd 40 .",
    "one possibility for gd 40 is that both heating and crust loss have occurred , and that ca and ti are enhanced because the heating effect on their abundances dominates over the crust loss . in that case , if the gd 40 parent body had not lost its crust , the ca , ti , and al abundances would be even more enhanced than what are measured now .",
    "fegley & cameron ( 1987 ) describe another mechanism  a silicate vaporization process  which removes substantial quantities of material ( e.g. @xmath12 80% of mercury s silicate ) from the outer layers of a differentiated body due to prolonged heating .",
    "their calculations were designed to explain the unusually high density of planet mercury and are successful at doing so by modeling the protoplanet s exposure to a high - temperature ( 2500 k  3500 k ) phase of the primitive solar nebula .",
    "more generally we obtain a sense of the constitutional evolution of a planetary body with an initially chondritic composition after experiencing a period of intense heating .",
    "the models predict a unique resulting abundance pattern such that , relative to chondritic abundances , the mantle+crust becomes depleted in sio@xmath31 , while mgo , cao , tio@xmath31 , and al@xmath31o@xmath44 are enhanced . in particular , model # 4 ( from table 4 of fegley & cameron 1987 ) yields si / mg , ca / mg , and ti / mg ratios in agreement with gd 40 s measured values , as shown in table 6 .",
    "we do not refer to the iron abundances from the mantle+crust results of fegley & cameron ( 1987 ) since in their model most of the iron resides in a core .",
    "this silicate vaporization model can simultaneously reproduce the si depletion , and the ca and ti enhancements in gd 40 s polluting parent body , however , the calculated high density planet has an iron - to - silicate mass ratio twice that of earth , which is appropriate for planet mercury , but is not what we observe in gd 40 .",
    "although this model involves differentiation of the parent body and essentially an erosion of the outer layers - mechanisms which we think are important - it is highly idealized and its application to real systems is uncertain .",
    "finally we note that a crust / mantle differentiated body is likely to have also formed a core composed primarily of fe metal as in earth s core .",
    "as discussed in @xmath164.3 , within the uncertainties of gd 40 s steady state pollutant abundances , the oxide balance allows up to 70% of the iron to originate from a metallic form ( @xmath1 55% if the iron oxide is predominantly feo ) , although a rocky composition with no metallic iron is also allowed by the oxygen budget ( table 5 ) .",
    "this translates to an upper limit on the size of a metallic core in the accreted parent body at @xmath1225% of its total mass ( assuming a vesta - like core composition of 0.89 fe by mass , as modeled by ghosh & mcsween 1998 ) . for comparison ,",
    "earth s core is 32% of its mass ( allegre et al .",
    "1995 ) , and estimates of core sizes in mars , vesta , and the moon are 30% , 10% and 5% of their total masses , respectively ( righter & drake , 1996 ) .",
    "our keck / hires observations and abundance analysis make gd 40 the second dusty polluted white dwarf ( gd 362 is the first ) with a comprehensive set of measured element abundances and at least the mass of a large asteroid in its outer convective layer .",
    "gd 40 s atmosphere is polluted by material with a rocky chemical composition , approximately similar to bulk earth which is dominated by o , mg , si , and fe .",
    "the inferred parent body was not a predominantly icy object , containing at most 10% , but more likely @xmath1 3% , water by mass .",
    "the balance of elements within oxides and water implies that the system is in , or near , an accretion  diffusion steady state , which places a lower bound on gd 40 s disk lifetime at @xmath57 .",
    "these results , taken together with the infrared @xmath9 observations , can best be explained by the accretion of an orbitally - perturbed , tidally - disrupted , ancient , planetary parent body of at least the mass of vesta ( radius @xmath12 270 km ) , carrying with it a history of this extrasolar system s formation and/or evolution .",
    "the suite of element abundances reveals enhanced ca and ti , probably due to thermal processing , and a distinctively low si / mg ratio which may be an indication that differentiation has occurred in this planetary system , since a minor planet stripped of its crust could conceivably cause the silicon deficiency . within the uncertainties of the oxygen budget",
    ", the accreted body may have had a metallic core up to one - quarter of its total mass .",
    "because a solid planetary body has conveniently been ground down to its elemental constituents , this dusty polluted white dwarf provides us a powerful tool for measuring the bulk chemical composition of an extrasolar minor planet , at a level of detail and precision greater than what is possible for most terrestrial planetary bodies in our own solar system .",
