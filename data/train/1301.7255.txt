    "quenched randomness effects are very important in modeling real materials , since consideration of these effects simulates a realistic model of real materials .",
    "real materials have some uncontrollable defects and these defects can be modeled by introducing site dilution ( randomly distributed non magnetic atoms ) , bond dilution ( randomly broken bonds between the magnetic atoms ) or both of them into the related model .",
    "it is a well known fact that , heisenberg model produces more realistic results than the ising model , in order to explain the magnetic properties of real materials .",
    "thus , it is important to work on the heisenberg model with these quenched randomness effects .",
    "these quenched randomness effects produce different behaviors in the magnetic properties of the model , e.g. different phase transition characteristics from the pure model ( i.e. the model without any quenched randomness effects ) .",
    "heisenberg model with quenched randomness effects has been studied widely by a variety of methods , such as spin-1/2 ( s-1/2 ) isotropic heisenberg model with bond dilution on 2d lattices with monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite , anisotropic model ( by means of the xxz model ) on 2d lattices with real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) technique @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "random bond distributed systems in which spin glass phases originate have been studied , e.g. discrete distribution on s-1/2 heisenberg model with pair approximation @xcite , density matrix product approximation @xcite , gaussian distribution with imaginary time grassmann field theory @xcite and s-1 heisenberg model with discretely distributed random bonds with exact diagonalization method@xcite . besides , both site and bond diluted systems have been studied with quantum mc on 2d lattices @xcite and s-1/2 heisenberg model with site - bond correlated dilution ( which covers uncorrelated site dilution as a limit ) on 2d and 3d lattices with rsrg @xcite and mc @xcite , and also using a variational principle for the free energy @xcite .",
    "all of these work are related to the isotropic heisenberg model or xxz model .",
    "the aim of this work is determine the effect of the bond dilution on the phase diagrams and the thermodynamic properties of the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model .",
    "by anisotropy , we do not restrict ourselves with xxz model .",
    "namely , we want to determine the effect of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction on the phase transition characteristics not only by means of xxz model .",
    "the method is effective field theory ( eft ) with two spin cluster approximation@xcite .",
    "eft approximation can provide results that are superior to those obtained within the traditional mean field approximation ( mfa ) , due to the consideration of self spin correlations which are omitted in the mfa .",
    "eft for a typical magnetic system starts by constructing a finite cluster of spins which represents the system .",

    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) .",
    "firstly , as the anisotropy increases then the bond percolation thresholds decrease for a while then tend to increase .",

    "( [ sek3])(b ) verifies the results in table ( 1 ) .",
    "secondly , increasing anisotropy can induce a reentrant behavior in the phase diagrams ( e.g. see the curve labeled by b in fig .",

    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( d ) . for @xmath92 , with low anisotropies ( i.e. small values of @xmath64 ) , there are no phase diagrams .",
    "the system can not exhibit an ordered phase . when the value of @xmath64 increases then the phase diagrams appear and then disappear again . in conclusion",
    ", we can say that while the transition from the @xmath86 type symmetry to the @xmath70 type symmetry ( fig .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( a ) ) rising anisotropy in the exchange interaction can not induce reentrant behavior in the phase diagrams which are in the @xmath93 plane .",
    "but , if increasing anisotropy causes a transition from the @xmath70 type symmetry to the @xmath83 type symmetry then it can induce a reentrant behavior in the phase diagrams in the @xmath93 plane , ( fig .",
    "( [ sek3 ] ) ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "in order to concentrate on the evolution of the bond percolation threshold value with anisotropy in the exchange interaction , let us investigate the variation of @xmath74 value with @xmath64 for some selected values of @xmath63 .",

    "( [ sek4])(a ) ) .",
    "when @xmath63 increases , the @xmath74 value corresponding to @xmath95 increases and after a specific value of @xmath96 the @xmath74 value for @xmath95 becomes @xmath94 .",
    "this value is nothing but the value of the curve labeled by a intersects the @xmath97 , due to the symmetry of the formulation as mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "this is just the value that makes the critical temperature of the pure system ( i.e. @xmath98 ) equal to zero with @xmath70 type symmetry .",
    "we can numerically determine the similar borders of the model with @xmath83 type symmetry .    as seen in fig .",
