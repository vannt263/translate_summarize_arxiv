    "when the large - scale density fluctuations are assumed to be gaussian , they are fully characterized by their power spectrum @xmath11 , which is directly related to cosmological parameters that we wish to estimate .",

    "it is therefore advantageous to estimate the mass - density @xmath11 directly from dynamical data such as peculiar velocities ( pvs ) , which avoid biasing and suffers from weaker nonlinear effects .",
    "the @xmath11 is evaluated here via a likelihood analysis of the individual pvs , not via a reconstruction method like potent ( dekel 1999 ) .",
    "the simplifying assumptions made in turn are that the pvs are drawn from a gaussian random field , the velocity correlations can be derived from the density @xmath11 using linear theory , and the errors are gaussian .",
    "the method assumes as prior a parametric functional form for the @xmath11 , which allows cosmological parameter estimation .",

    "the sfi data were corrected for biases as in freudling ( 1999 , f99 ) .    in zaroubi ( 1997 , z97 ) and f99 ,",
    "we applied a likelihood analysis with a _ linear _ @xmath11 model on all scales , taken from the family of cobe - normalized cdm models .",
    "the free parameters were @xmath3 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",

    "we therefore generated new mock catalogs based on simulations of higher resolution , which reveal a significant bias in the linear analysis .",
    "the fit is driven by the small scales , because close pairs tend to consist of nearby galaxies with small errors , and therefore weak nonlinear effects on small scales may bias the results .",
    "we improve the analysis by adding free parameters that allow independent matching of the nonlinear behavior and thus an unbiased determination of the linear part of the spectrum and the associated cosmological parameters .",

    "it seems to be associated with a problem noticed earlier by f99 , of a spatial gradient in the obtained value of @xmath3 .",

    "@xmath27 is computed , inverted , and substituted in . exploring parameter space",
    ", we find the parameters that maximize the likelihood .",
    "the main computational effort is the inversion of @xmath27 in each evaluation of the likelihood .",
    "it is an @xmath42 matrix , where currently @xmath43 , but when @xmath18 increases soon , a procedure for data compression will be required ( see ) .",
    "the measurement errors add in quadrature to the @xmath11 and thus propagate into a systematic uncertainty .",
    "z97 used  estimates of the errors , while f99 incorporated the errors into the likelihood analysis via an error model with free parameters .",
    "they found errors within 5% of the  estimates , thus allowing the use of the  estimates here .",
    "relative confidence levels are estimated by approximating @xmath44 as a @xmath10 distribution with respect to the model parameters .    in the linear regime",
    ", we use as prior the parametric form based on the general cdm model , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the normalization factor and @xmath47 is the cdm transfer function proposed by sugiyama ( 1995 ) . we restrict ourselves in the present paper to flat cosmology with a cosmological constant ( @xmath48 ) , a scale - invariant power spectrum on large scales ( @xmath2 ) , and a hubble constant @xmath1 .",

    "an accurate nonlinear correction to the linear _",

    "an empirical approximation does exist for the nonlinear correction to the _ density _ @xmath11 ( peacock & dodds 1996 , pd ) , but the generalization to a velocity correction is not straightforward . here , we detach the nonlinear regime from the linear regime by a  break \" in the @xmath11 at a wavenumber @xmath52 .",
    "we then assume the  shape at @xmath53 , determined by @xmath3 , and allow an almost arbitrary power law with two free parameters to fit the data at @xmath5 .",
    "this  feeds the nonlinear monster \" while the linear part of the spectrum , and the associated cosmological parameters , are freed to be determined unbiased .",
    "we test the method using mock catalogs based on cosmological simulations in which the  true \" cosmological parameters and linear @xmath11 are fully known , and where nonlinear effects are simulated with adequate accuracy .",
    "we use the unconstrained  gif \" simulation ( kauffmann 1999a ) of the flat  cosmology with @xmath54 .",

    "luminous galaxies were planted in the halos based on a semi - analytic scheme ( kauffmann 1999a , 1999b ) .",
    "we assigned to each galaxy a linewidth based on the tf relation and the scatter assumed in kolatt ( 1996 ) .",
    "we then generated 10 mock catalogs which resemble the m3 catalog , with random distance errors and random sampling .",
    "the mock data were grouped and corrected for malmquist biases exactly as in the real data .    to study how the method performs in the presence of nonlinear effects",

    "we first apply the purely linear analysis , with the linear  power spectrum at all scales , and with @xmath3 as the only free parameter .",
    "we see that the linear likelihood analysis systematically overestimates the value of @xmath3 .",
    "as the data become more nonlinear , the recovered value of @xmath3 becomes higher , and the bias more significant .",
    "next , we apply the improved procedure , allowing for a break in the @xmath11 at @xmath71 and additional free parameters in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we see that the bias is practically removed for all levels of nonlinearity .",
    "the figure also shows the corresponding improvement in @xmath72 when the linear analysis is replaced with the nonlinear analysis . shows the corresponding power spectra from the m3 mock catalogs of linearity @xmath73 .",
    "our conclusion from the above test using the mock catalogs is that , in the presence of significant nonlinear effects in the data , the purely linear likelihood analysis might yield a biased estimate of @xmath11 and @xmath3 .",
    "the broken-@xmath11 analysis successfully eliminates the dependence of the results on the nonlinear effects and practically corrects the bias in the results .",
    "we now analyze the real data . our  model is restricted again to a flat universe with @xmath1 , @xmath74 and @xmath2 , leaving only one cosmological parameter free , @xmath3 . unlike the mock tests",
    ", we now do not know that  is the right model or that the values of the fixed parameters are accurate . shows the resultant power spectra .",
    "the linear analysis yields a high @xmath11 amplitude and a high value of @xmath75 , corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath77 for m3 and sfi ( @xmath78 errors ) , consistent with z97 and f99 for the fixed values of @xmath19 and @xmath18 quoted above .",
    "the nonlinear analysis yields a shift of @xmath75 towards lower @xmath24 s , associated with lower values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 for m3 and sfi .",

    "the corresponding best - fit values of @xmath81 are @xmath82 and @xmath83 for m3 and sfi .",
    "these values are consistent with the estimates from cluster abundance ( , eke 1998 ) .",
    "the reduction in the value of @xmath3 due to the nonlinear correction is similar to the mock catalog case at a relatively high degree of nonlinearity , @xmath84 in .",
    "the power - law segments roughly coincide with the linear  segments at @xmath52 , indicating that this broken @xmath11 is a sensible approximation to the actual shape of @xmath11 .",
    "the two catalogs basically yield consistent results . as expected , the nonlinear correction for m3 is larger than for sfi , because the former has more galaxies nearby in close pairs with small errors .",
    "the likelihood improvement for m3 is very significant , @xmath85 , while for sfi it is moderate , @xmath86 .",
    "we find that the results are quite insensitive to the choice of @xmath52 over a wide range . at @xmath87 , corresponding to large pair separation and thus involving mostly distant objects of large errors , there are insufficient data to constrain the power spectrum , and the errors become big . at very large values of @xmath52 ,",
    "the analysis recovers the results of the linear analysis , but only when @xmath52 approaches the artificial cutoff applied to @xmath11 arbitrarily at @xmath88 for the purpose of finite numerical integration .",
    "it seems that any little freedom allowed in the model beyond the strict linear @xmath11 is enough for correcting the bias associated with the linear analysis .",
    "indeed , an alternative way to incorporate nonlinear effects is by adding to the linear velocity correlation model a free parameter of uncorrelated velocity dispersion at zero lag , @xmath89 .",
    "when this correction is applied by itself , the best value of @xmath3 becomes @xmath90 ( instead of 0.56 in the linear analysis ) with @xmath91 .",
    "when the two different nonlinear corrections are applied together , a break plus @xmath89 , the best - fit value of @xmath89 is close to zero , indicating that the two corrections are practically redundant .",
    "we now push the idea further , and divide the power spectrum into 4 detached segments .",
    "this allows a more general shape for @xmath11 , less dependent on  assumptions about a physical model such as , but at the expense of giving up the attempt to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "( the choice of a series of independent step functions , or  band powers \" forming a histogram , is especially appealing computationally , because it makes the correlation matrix a linear combination of the correlation matrices of the individual segments , and then the integrals involved need to be computed only once . )",
    "our 5-parameter model actually consists of the following segments : ( a ) cobe - normalized  in the extreme linear regime , @xmath92 , with one free parameter , @xmath3 , ( b ) a free constant amplitude in the interval @xmath93 near @xmath75 , ( c ) an independent free amplitude in the interval @xmath94 , and ( d ) a power law as before in the nonlinear regime , @xmath95 .",
    "shows the recovered 4-band @xmath11 , in comparison with the  results .",
    "the nonlinear segment practically recovers the results of the broken-  analysis .",
    "the two most linear segments lie along the results of the linear analysis , with a higher peak than in the broken-  case .",
    "the most interesting feature is the low amplitude in the interval @xmath96 , in the ",
    "blue \" side of the peak and just shy of the transition to the nonlinear regime .",
    "the features in the linear regime contribute only a marginal improvement to the overall likelihood , and should therefore be considered as a marginal hint only .",
    "this could be a fluke due to distance errors and cosmic variance , but the consistent appearance in the two datasets makes it intriguing .",
    "the marginal deviation from the broken-  @xmath11 thus consists of a wiggle , with a power excess near the peak , @xmath8 , and a deficiency at @xmath97 .",
    "the missing power is reminiscent of other indications for  cold flow \" in the peculiar velocity field in the local cosmological neighborhood . while the streaming motions on @xmath98 scales are @xmath99 , the dispersion velocity of field galaxies is only @xmath100 , indicating a high mach number ( , suto , cen & ostriker 1992 ; chiu , ostriker & strauss 1998 ; dekel 2000 ) .",
    "the likelihood analysis is limited to estimating relative likelihoods for the parameters , but it does not address the absolute gof of the model and data .",
    "the linear analysis of both m3 and sfi revealed a worry concerning the gof , in the sense that when applied separately to two halves of the data , separated either by distance or line width , the distant data prefer a lower @xmath3 .",
    "the mock catalogs have not revealed a similar problem , indicating that it is caused by inadequacies of the correlation matrix , associated with either the theoretical or the error model .",
    "this motivates an attempt to evaluate gof , hoping that the broken-@xmath11 resolves the two - halves problem .",
    "assume a data vector @xmath101 , which is a random realization of an gaussian distribution , with the correlation matrix @xmath102 .",
    "a global gof could be evaluated using the @xmath10 statistic , @xmath103 .",
    "if @xmath27 is the true correlation matrix , then this value should obey a @xmath10 distribution with @xmath18 degrees of freedom .",
    "but this single number can not capture all the particulars of the fitting process .",
    "a pca , in which the data are represented in terms of the eigenvector basis of the ( assumed ) correlation matrix , provides a powerfull tool for identifying gross features of the data and model , and for evaluating gof in fine detail .",
    "we diagonalize the matrix via the transformation @xmath104 , into @xmath105 .",
    "the likelihood analysis can be performed in terms of the new  data \" points @xmath106 .",
    "the rows @xmath107 of @xmath108 are the eigenvectors , or the principal modes , and the diagonal terms @xmath109 of @xmath110 are the corresponding eigenvalues . the new variables , @xmath111 , are expected to be uncorrelated unit gaussian random variables .",
    "this property is a measure of gof , which can be evaluated by the @xmath112 statistic .",
    "if this test uncovers systematic effects , they may be associated with certain features of the data and model via a detailed investigation of the eigenmodes .",
    "the eigenmodes are ordered by the amplitude of their eigenvalues , from large to small .",
    "the high - eigenvalue modes are assigned a higher signifcance , because the confidence levels in the recovered parameters inversly correlate with the squares of the eigenvalues ( tegmark , taylor & heavens 1997 ) , and because perturbation analysis implies that small - eigenvalue modes are more sensitive to perturbations in the correlation matrix . since our correlation matrix",
    "is expected to be only an approximation , it would be advantageous to avoid these modes .",
    "a straightforward application of pca is with the standard correlation matrix , @xmath113 , where large eigenvalues may correspond to large signal or large noise or both .",
    "another possibility , which we term @xmath114 , is to first perform a  whitening \" transformation , @xmath115 ( vogeley & szalay 1996 ) , such that the new correlation matrix is @xmath116 ,    the eigenmodes can help us identify certain features of the data and models .",
    "for example , the distance associated with a mode may be useful because distant modes are typically noisier and because it may connect to the two - halves problem .",
    "for eigenvector @xmath117 , the average distance is @xmath118 , where the sum is over the sample of galaxies , @xmath119 is the distance of galaxy @xmath120 , and @xmath121 defines the vector @xmath117 in the basis @xmath120 .",
    "if the standard deviation , defined in analogy , is small compared to the average distance , then most of the information associated with this mode comes from galaxies within a certain distance range . shows the average distance for each mode .",
    "the robust high s / n modes are typically associated with nearby data , which are of smaller errors . these tend to involve close pairs , and therefore stronger nonlinear effects , which makes the nonlinear correction a must .",
    "the s+n modes show a correlation with distance in the opposite sense , in which the high - eigenvalue modes are typically associated with large distances and therefore noisy data .",
    "this means that most of the s+n modes are dominated by the noise , which would not allow a sensible truncation by s+n modes , but should allow a more sensitive measure of gof , refering in particular to the error model .",
    "after pca , we expect @xmath122 to be about unity for each mode separately .",
    "this tests whether the eigenmodes of the prior correlation matrix are really uncorrelated with the proper variance , and , in the case of a poor fit for a certain mode , it can guide us to the source of the problem .",
    "the statistic shown in , for each mode number @xmath123 , is the cummulative @xmath10 per degree of freedom , @xmath124 .",
    "the expected value is unity , and the expected standard deviation is @xmath125 .    for the s",
    "/ n pca of m3 , the gof of the linear model is marginal , in the sense that the typical deviations are at the @xmath22 level .",
    "the low-@xmath123 modes , except for the very first ones , typically have low @xmath126 values , while the large-@xmath123 modes have high values . this behavior can be translated to a systematic trend with distance via the correlation between distance and mode ( ) .",
    "it is therefore a reminiscence of the two - halves problem .",
    "we see in that the broken-  model clearly improves the gof as far as the s / n modes of m3 are concerned , where the cummulative @xmath126 lies well inside the @xmath22 contours for all the modes , with no apparent systematic dependence on @xmath123 .",
    "it implies that the broken-  @xmath11 is a more appropriate model for the data .",
    "when we analyze the s+n modes in a similar way in , the linear model , for both data sets , shows a more severe deviation of @xmath126 from unity , at the @xmath127 level , and a similar systematic dependence on @xmath123 .",
    "the two - halves problem is very obvious here , with the more distant , noisy data favoring a smaller amplitude for @xmath11 . in this case , the use of the better , broken-  model makes only a small improvement which does not resolve the problem .",
    "this is a clear indication that something may be wrong in the error model as well .",
    "we recall that the low-@xmath123 s+n modes are associated with large distances , where the errors are large and are known to a lesser accuracy .",
    "guided by , we try a poor - man compression of the data by eliminating all the data points that lie at @xmath128 .",
    "this leaves us with @xmath129 out of the @xmath130 ( grouped ) data points of m3 , and @xmath131 out of the @xmath132 galaxies of sfi .",
    "this truncation causes an increase in the best - fit value of @xmath3 by less than @xmath133 , both for m3 and sfi , and causes only a minor widening of the likelihood contours . in the case of m3 , we see in that the s+n modes of the linear model and the truncated data show an improved gof compared to the case of the whole data , but the @xmath126 still show @xmath134 deviations from unity and a systematic dependence on @xmath123 .",
    "however , the s+n modes of the broken-  model and m3 data now do lie within the @xmath22 contours .",
    "the systematic trend with @xmath123 is still apparent , indicating that the correlation matrix is still not perfect ; either the error model is still only an approximation even for the truncated data , or the broken-  @xmath11 is not yet a perfect model ( as seen in ) , or the signal and/or the noise are not exactly gaussian , or all of the above .    in the case of sfi , while the s / n modes look very adequate with both models , for the s+n cummulative statistic the improvements due to the nonlinear correction and the elimination of large - distance galaxies are apparently not enough for an acceptable gof .",
    "since the large - eigenvalue s+n modes , which dominate the cummulative statistic , are dominated by noise , the limited gof is likely to point at further shortcomings of the error model for sfi .",
    "a likelihood analysis is supposed to recover unbiased values for the free parameters of a model provided that the prior theoretical model and the error model allow accurate description of the data .",
    "we addressed here tools to recover the parameters given incomplete knowledge of these models .    using mock catalogs based on high - resolution simulations",
    ", we realized that the likelihood analysis of pv data , based on the linear  @xmath11 , is driven by the nonlinear part of the spectrum which is not modeled accurately , and therefore yields biased results .",
    "a broken-  @xmath11 , in which the @xmath5 segment is replaced by a two - parameter power law , allows a better , independent fit in the nonlinear regime .",
    "it then frees the linear regime from nonlinear effects , and yields unbiased results for @xmath3 .",
    "the results are robust to the specific choice of @xmath52 ; we choose @xmath135 , which is where the nonlinear density @xmath11 is expected to start deviating from the linear @xmath11 by the pd approximation .",
    "the results are also robust to the exact way by which the nonlinear effects are incorporated .",
    "when we add a zero - lag velocity dispersion term to the correlation function , we obtain similar results .    when applied to the real data of m3 or sfi , for a flat  model with @xmath2 and @xmath1 , the improved analysis yields best - fits of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , corresponding to @xmath138 and @xmath83 .",
    "these are in agreement with most constraints from other data , including cmb anisotropies and cluster abundance ( , bahcall 1999 ) .",
    "joint analysis of pvs with other data is pursued based on the linear analysis ( zehavi & dekel 1999 ) and the nonlinear analysis ( bridle 2000 ) .    by allowing an more general shape for @xmath11 , with 4 detached segments",
    ", we detect a marginal deviation from the , in the form of a wiggle , with an enhanced amplitude near @xmath139 and a significant depletion near @xmath9 .",
    "this  cold flow \" on a scale of a few tens of megaparsecs is reminiscent of similar indications from the @xmath11 of galaxies and clusters in redshift surveys ( baugh & gaztaaga 1998 ; landy 1996 ; einasto 1997 ; suhhonenko & gramann 1999 ) .",
    "most recent is the wiggle indicated in the 2df redshift survey .",
    "the local phenomenon of cold flow may be related to the low second peak as measured by boomerang and maxima in the cmb angular power spectrum on a similar scale ( boomerang , de bernardis 2000 ; maxima , hanany 2000 ) .",
    "the wiggly feature may be interpreted as a deviation from the standard cosmological mass mixture , , a higher baryonic content than indicated by the deuterium abundance and big - bang nucleosynthesis , or a non - negligible contribution from hot dark - matter .",
    "but the excess required to produce a significant wiggle seems to violate upper limits from other data ; the density of baryons is limited by he+d abundances via the theory of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( tytler 2000 ) , and the density of neutrinos is constrained by large - scale structure ( , ma 1999 ; gawiser 2000 ) . the possibility that this feature is a statistical fluke due to cosmic variance in the context of the  model can not be ruled out yet .",
    "a pca , either in s / n or s+n modes , allows a fine test of gof , by applying a @xmath10 test mode by mode .",
    "it shows that the broken-  model is a better fit to the data than the purely linear  model . for m3 ,",
    "using the  whitened \" s / n modes , the nonlinear correction is enough to eliminate the  two - halves \" problem that troubled the linear analysis . when the s+n modes are analyzed , the correction to the theoretical model is helpful but not enough for an acceptable gof .",
    "when the m3 data is further truncated at @xmath140 , eliminating distant galaxies for which the errors are large and the error model is inaccurate , the gof becomes acceptable .",
    "for sfi , the s / n modes seem adequate , but the s+n pca indicates that the error model is still more complex than assumed .",
    "the pca is a powerful tool for addressing interesting properties of the data and its relation to the theoretical and error model . in particular , we associated each mode with a distance and learned about the correlation between mode eigenvalues and distance errors .",
    "this was useful in the study of gof and in truncating the data to deal with inaccuracies in the error model .",
    "the pca will be extremely useful when one tries to compress the data while keeping the optimal part for determining a specific desired parameter .",
    "this compression may be mandatory for computational reasons when the body of data is excessively large .",
