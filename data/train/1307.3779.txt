    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite arose as a response to attempts by physicists to obtain a unified description of all fundamental interaction of nature and it is at present one of the most favoured ideas for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "the realistic extension of the sm , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) so that it is constructed by declaring the superpartners ( sparticles ) of the sm states , and declaring an additional higgs doublet ( higgsinos ) which has opposite hypercharge according to higgs doublet in the sm , so as to give separately masses to isospin up- and down - type chiral fermions and cancel the gauge anomalies @xcite .",
    "the mssm contains a discrete symmetry known as r - parity @xcite so that it ensures lepton and baryon number conservations . assuming that conservation @xmath4-parity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is definitely stable and this particle is the end product of any process involving sparticle in the final state . in most cases ,",
    "the stable lsp is the lightest neutralino , which is one of the superpartners of the electroweak ( ew ) gauge bosons ( gauginos ) and the higgs doublet ( higgsinos ) , which mix to form four neutral ( neutralinos @xmath5 ) and two charged ( charginos @xmath6 ) mass eigenstates .",
    "the higgsino and gaugino decomposition of the neutralinos and charginos includes significant information about the susy - breaking mechanism and also plays an important role in the explanation of the relic density of the dark matter @xcite .",
    "thus a detailed study of the production of the lightest neutralino @xmath7 and the next - to - lightest neutralino @xmath8 at present and future experiments is so important that the neutralino sector can be help us to decide which kind of the supersymmetric models really exists in nature .    in the literature , some of the studies related to neutralino pair production in the mssm as follows :",
    "the neutralino pair production via quark - antiquark annihilation at lhc was investigated in ref .",

    "we recover the lagrangian parameters as direct analytical expressions of suitable physical masses without any constrained in the mssm , in such a way that we essentially focus on the algebraically nontrivial inversion for the gaugino mass parameters , i.e. , using @xmath10 and two chargino masses as input parameters , one can be obtained the other parameters , which are gaugino / higgsino mass parameters , neutralino masses and mixing matrix as outputs .",
    "we have not only taken into account the process @xmath0 at the born level , but also logarithmic ew contributions to that process at the one - loop level .",
