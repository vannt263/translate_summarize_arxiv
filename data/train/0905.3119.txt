    "the radiative capture of a slow neutron on @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , or the @xmath2 process , is an example of rare situations where the contributions of the single - nucleon ( 1b ) currents are strongly suppressed due to the pseudo - orthogonality of the wave functions ; viz .",
    ", since the major components of the initial and final state wave functions belong to different representations of symmetry group , they can not be connected through the @xmath7-independent leading 1b operators . in fact",
    ", this suppression is so strong that the meson - exchange - current ( mec ) ",
    "corrections \" become comparable to the 1b contributions , and furthermore , since the mec and 1b terms in this case come with opposite signs , a strong cancellation between them occurs , leading to a further drastic suppression of the cross section .",
    "the @xmath2 process near threshold is governed by the m1 operators , and the mec contributions to them consist of the well - known one - pion - exchange part and the short - range part .",
    "it is to be noted that the latter is not constrained by the symmetries of qcd , and that because of the above - mentioned suppression and the cancellation mechanisms , the short - range contributions are crucial even for a rough estimation of the @xmath2 cross section .",
    "furthermore , the strong suppression of the 1b matrix elements implies that their values are highly sensitive to the details of the wave functions .",
    "therefore , for a precise estimation of the @xmath2 cross section , it is imperative to have : ( i ) a reliable method for deriving the relevant mec operators with a good control of short - range physics , and ( ii ) the accurate wave functions for the initial and final wave functions .",
    "these requirements make the quantitative estimation of the @xmath8 cross section highly non - trivial .    the strong enhancement of the relative importance of mec in the @xmath2 process makes it a valuable testing ground for our understanding of the roles of mec in light nuclei . apart from this point , which is important on its own right , a careful study of the @xmath2 process is also of great importance in connection with the so - called @xmath8 processes , @xmath9 , because @xmath8 shares all the aforementioned features of @xmath2 : the drastic suppression of the 1b contributions , strong cancellation between the 1b and 2b contributions , and the sensitivity of the transition amplitude to the details of the nuclear wave functions .",
    "the @xmath8 is one of the proton - burning reactions that take place in the interior of the sun and , since @xmath8 produces the highest - energy solar neutrinos among the @xmath10-chain reactions , it has attracted much attention in the study of the solar neutrinos ; see  @xcite for a recent review . in a recent paper ,",
    "park _ et al . _",
    "@xcite developed an effective field theory ( eft ) approach , which has come to be known as  more - effective eft \" ( meeft for short )  @xcite , and , with the use of meeft , they calculated the @xmath8 @xmath11-factor with an estimated accuracy of about 15 % . in view of the fact that the previous theoretical estimations of the @xmath8 @xmath11-factor ranged over two orders of magnitude  @xcite ,",
    "this is a remarkable feat . a direct test of this theoretical result",
    ", however , is not possible because of the extreme difficulty of measuring the @xmath8 cross section .",
    "meanwhile , the threshold @xmath2 cross section has been measured with a reasonable accuracy : @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "given the close similarity between @xmath2 and @xmath8 , it is expected that comparison between theory and experiment for the @xmath2 case will offer valuable information on the validity of the theoretical framework employed for the @xmath8 calculation in @xcite .",
    "this gives an additional motivation for carrying out a detailed study of @xmath2 .",
    "although the theoretical investigation of @xmath2 has a long history , the @xmath2 cross section has never been explained in a satisfactory manner .",
    "towner and khanna  @xcite and wervelman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed shell - model calculations and obtained @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "@xcite , arriving at @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "these works are based on the conventional approach , the so - called _ standard nuclear physics approach _ ( snpa for short ) , which consists in the use of phenomenological transition operators and phenomenological wave functions .",
    "snpa has been enormously successful in correlating and explaining a vast range of electroweak nuclear transitions in light nuclei but , from a formal point of view , it has an insufficiency that it is not equipped with a systematic way of deriving mec operators .",
    "the mec operators in snpa are constructed based on the approach of chemtob and rho  @xcite .",
    "although this construction of the mec operators is guided by chiral symmetry and the ward identities related to the adopted hamiltonians , a certain degree of model dependence is unavoidable .    in this paper",
    "we report on a parameter - free meeft calculation for the @xmath2 cross section at threshold which is based on essentially the same method as adopted in @xcite . , but an approximate treatment of the scattering wave function in  @xcite limits its reliability . ] in meeft the transition operators are derived in a systematic expansion based on hbchpt , and the nuclear matrix elements are obtained by sandwiching these operators between wave functions generated from a high - precision phenomenological nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "mismatch in the short - range is overcome by the renormalization procedure for the local operators , according to the premise of low - energy efts ( see below ) .",
    "it thus takes advantage of the systematic nature of efts and the availability of state - of - art wave functions .",
    "the mentioned  formal \" mismatch may be regarded as a weak point , and also the accurate reproduction of the relevant effective - range parameters ( erps ) is not automatically guaranteed in meeft ; we shall come back to these points later in the text .    in the present work we derive the m1 operators within hbchpt up to 3 .",
    "these m1 operators turn out to contain two low - energy constants ( lecs ) , denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are the coefficients of two - nucleon contact - term operators .",
    "these lecs can be fixed by requiring that the experimental values of the magnetic moments of the triton and @xmath5 be reproduced ; this is the same strategy as adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the m1 properties of the @xmath20=@xmath21 and @xmath20=@xmath22 systems were studied in meeft .",
    "a remark is in order here on how the short - range contributions are taken into account in meeft . the basic premise of eft is that physics pertaining to ranges shorter than the experimentally relevant scale is to be lodged in local operators .",
    "it means that , provided that a proper renormalization procedure is implemented to the coefficients of local operators ( _ i.e. , _ lecs ) , the renormalization invariance ensures that the net physical amplitudes be independent of the details of short - range physics .",
    "we implement the renormalization condition here by adjusting the values of lecs ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath2 and @xmath23 for @xmath8 ) so as to reproduce a set of known experimental data [ @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath2 and the tritium - beta - decay rate for @xmath8 ] .",
    "this matching procedure should be done for each cutoff value and for each hamiltonian adopted . and",
    "nuclear hamiltonians used will be given later in the text .",
    "] differences in short - range contributions calculated for each case shift the values of lecs ( which are not physical observables ) , but the physical amplitudes should remain unaffected if renormalization invariance is to hold . the validity of this scheme can be checked by monitoring the stability of the relevant physical observables with respect to changes in the cutoff parameter @xmath26 .",
    "it turns out ( see below ) that , in the present @xmath2 case , the inclusion of the local - operator ( or contact term ) contributions reduces the @xmath26-dependence by a factor of @xmath275 , demonstrating the validity of the adopted renormalization procedure .",
    "the residual @xmath26-dependence may be ascribed to higher order contributions .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath20-body systems with @xmath28 , even a realistic nuclear hamiltonian often fails to reproduce accurately the erps that govern the long - range part of the transition matrix elements .",
    "if such a mismatch in the long - range region happens , it can not be cured by local operators , which means that one in general can not expect to have a reliable theoretical prediction . as an exception to this general statement ,",
    "however , we should mention that , if a strong correlation between the erps and the transition amplitude under consideration can be established with high precision , this correlation can be used to drastically reduce the model dependence of the calculated transition amplitude   @xcite .",
    "we shall take advantage of this feature later in the text ( subsection iii a ) to obtain as the best estimate for the threshold @xmath2 cross section : @xmath29 ( for the av18+uix potential ) , and @xmath30 ( for the i - n3lo+uix potential ) ; see eq.([sigma - hen ] ) .",
    "good agreement of these estimates with the experimental value of the @xmath2 cross section gives sound support to the previous meeft calculation for the @xmath8 @xmath11-factor  @xcite .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the present work is the first calculation of @xmath2 that employs nuclear wave functions which are fully consistent with a given realistic nuclear hamiltonian ; these wave functions are numerically exact solutions to the faddeev - yakubovski equations in configuration space for a specified realistic nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "it is to be noted that hitherto even the most advanced realistic calculations  @xcite contained some artificial adjustments to suppress the @xmath31 channel in the scattering wave functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we explain the formalisms used to derive the m1 operators and to obtain the four - body nuclear wave functions .",
    "section 3 gives the numerical results and analysis . in the final section",
    "the implication of our work is discussed .",
    "we derive here the electromagnetic ( em ) currents and m1 from hbchpt up to @xmath32 in chiral order counting .",
    "hbchpt contains nucleons and pions as pertinent degrees of freedom , with all the other massive fields integrated out . in hbchpt ,",
    "the em currents and m1 operators are expanded systematically with increasing powers of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 stands for a typical momentum scale of the process and/or the pion mass , and @xmath35  gev is the chiral scale , @xmath36 mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath37 is the nucleon mass .",
    "we remark that , while the nucleon momentum @xmath38 is of the order of @xmath34 , its energy ( @xmath39 ) is of the order of @xmath40 , and consequently the four - momentum of the emitted photon @xmath41 should also be counted as @xmath42 .",
    "the m1 operators up to @xmath32 consist of 1b and 2b contributions , while three - body operators in our counting scheme enter only at 4 or higher orders . in the center - of - mass frame , each current can be written in the form of @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the momentum carried out by the photon , @xmath45 for the 1b current pertaining to the @xmath46-th nucleon , while @xmath47 for the 2b currents involving the nucleons @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
