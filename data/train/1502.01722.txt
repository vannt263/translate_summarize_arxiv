    "this supplemental material describes a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm for estimating the rnyi entropy , @xmath92 , \\label{renyi}\\ ] ] using an extended - ensemble version of the so - called `` ratio method '' first applied in this context by humeniuk and roscilde @xcite . in the present work",
    ", the algorithm will be specialized to the case of the second rnyi entropy ( @xmath54 ) , although extensions to other @xmath93 are relatively straightforward .",
    "similarly , although we concentrate on applications to the spin-1/2 xy model , generalizations to hamiltonians with other symmetries are possible .",
    "qmc estimators for the second rnyi entropy @xmath61 rely on the fact that the trace over powers of the reduced density matrix can be related to a ratio of partition functions : @xmath94}{z[a{=}0,2,t ] } , \\label{zratio}\\ ] ] where the numerator is the partition function of a multi - sheeted riemann surface @xcite , ( a `` replicated '' qmc simulation cell ) and the denominator is the square of the regular partition function , @xmath56 = z[t]^2 $ ] . in the replicated case , the geometry of the entangled region @xmath2 dictates the `` boundaries '' of the @xmath95 dimensional qmc simulation cell ; world - lines in region @xmath2 are periodic in imaginary time with period @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 ) , while in region @xmath3 , 2 ( or @xmath93 ) independent replicas exist with periodicity @xmath98 .    since the logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ renyi ] ) reduces the calculation of @xmath61 to the difference in free energies between systems described by the two partition functions , thermodynamic integration or wang - landau techniques can be used to devise qmc estimators .",
    "in contrast , _ ratio methods _ ( not to be confused with the related `` ratio trick '' coined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) give an estimator for the ratio of partition functions , and act as valuable alternatives to explicit calculation of free energies .",
    "the most distinct advantage of ratio methods is their ability to calculate @xmath99 directly at a given fixed temperature",
    ". they can however be inefficient for large entropies ( large subregions @xmath2 ) , and may require several separate simulations of different subregion geometries ( that can be combined with the ratio trick ) to combat this .",
    "we begin by generalizing eq .",
    "( [ zratio ] ) to the problem of calculation the ratio of replicated partition functions defined with two arbitrary regions @xmath2 and @xmath100 ; namely @xmath101/z[a,2,t]$ ] . as with all ratio methods ,",
    "the qmc estimator in this case is based on a simple identity @xcite : @xmath102    where we have simplified our previous notation @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "the expectation value is taken in the @xmath104 ensemble and @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the weights of a configuration @xmath17 in the @xmath107 and @xmath104 ensembles respectfully .",
    "the difficulty of applying this identity in a straightforward manner is that it is valid only when the configuration space of @xmath107 , @xmath108 , is contained within the configuration space of @xmath109 , @xmath110  that is @xmath111 for any @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately , this condition is not automatically satisfied when the standard labelling variables are used in conventional qmc techniques .",
    "however , for the xy model , by introducing a new label , it is possible to recast the configuration spaces of both ensembles such that @xmath112 . in other words",
    ", a common label @xmath17 can be found that enumerates all possible configurations within both ensembles .    here",
    "we will consider a stochastic series expansion ( sse ) representation of the partition function  @xcite .",
    "a term in the sse expansion of @xmath113 can be represented by a spin state and an operator list , where the operators are terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "alternatively , we can represent the same configuration by a linked list of vertices @xcite ; an example of a set of vertices is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertices ] . we can therefore label the configuration by the list of links , @xmath114 , and the set of vertex types @xmath115 for a given boundary condition defined by @xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cells ] .",
    "here we have defined @xmath114 to include all `` internal '' links between vertices and we link the `` exterior '' vertices to the boundaries of the operator string ; we specifically do not close the links at the boundaries , as one would do in a regular @xmath95 dimensional qmc simulation cell @xcite    these two labels are sufficient to identify the configuration space of many models .",
    "thus , a partition function can be expressed as the following double sum : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the weight of a configuration labelled by @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "this general expression can be simplified for the xy model .",
    "the model s sse vertices are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertices ] . with an appropriate choice of adjustable sse constants ,",
    "the weight of each vertex becomes equal to @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "hence , the weight of a vertex configuration does not depend on a particular combination of vertices in the list and , therefore , is completely defined by the length of the corresponding operator list alone .",
    "we get that @xmath119 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : gen_part_func ] ) is simplified to : @xmath120    the second sum counts the degeneracy of vertex configurations compatible with the boundary conditions between replicas . motivated by the search for a variable independent of those boundary conditions , we introduce a new label , @xmath121 , that enumerates all possible partitions of a vertex configuration labelled by @xmath122 into a set of non - overlapping segments .",
    "the following algorithm is used to construct a single instance of those segments :    1 .",
    "pick an unmarked leg located on a boundary slice .",
    "mark it as visited .",
    "2 .   by following the linked list , switch to a leg connected to it .",
    "3 .   the new leg belongs to a vertex . *",
    "if this vertex is unmarked , pick with an equal probability one of two possible non - bounce moves for this vertex and switch to the corresponding leg .",
    "mark this vertex as visited and store the move type .",
    "* if the vertex is marked , switch to the next leg by performing a move of the same type that was done before .",
    "repeat steps 2 - 4 until a leg on a boundary slice is reached .    by repeating this algorithm for all legs located on the boundary slices ,",
    "all open segments are traced out .",
    "however , it is possible that some of the legs located on the inner slices have been left unmarked after this procedure . in order to partition those remaining legs too , the closed segments ( loops ) need to be traced .",
    "this is achieved by adjusting two steps of the algorithm .",
    "now in the first step , the choice of legs to be picked is extended to all interior legs .",
    "once the initial leg is picked , the algorithm proceeds in the same way until it reaches the same leg again .",
    "hence , the condition to terminate the execution of the forth step has to be modified appropriately . by construction",
    ", any two segments built in such a manner can never pass through the same leg and , therefore , are non - intersecting .    the loops tracing continues until all legs are marked . by the end of this procedure every leg belongs to one single segment ( closed or open ) .",
    "this constitutes a single instance of the partitioning of a vertex configuration into a set of non - overlapping segments .",
    "an example of such partition is shown in the first cell of fig .",
    "[ fig : cells ] .",
    "note that at each vertex , there are two choices how to proceed with the construction of a segment .",
    "each of them leads to a different partition .",
    "therefore , a simulation cell that contains @xmath123 vertices can be partitioned in @xmath124 distinct ways .",
    "this is the range of the newly introduced label @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath123 just counts the number of vertices without discerning their types , the number of partitions for a particular @xmath115 is determined by the @xmath114 label only .",
    "this fact allows to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : xy_part_func ] ) in a new form : @xmath126 this expression is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xy_part_func ] ) by introducing a third sum via the substitution : @xmath127 where the new sum is performed over all different partitions of @xmath115 .",
    "it can be also shown that for any vertex configuration in @xmath2 , @xmath115 , partitioned as @xmath121 , there exists a vertex configuration in @xmath100 , @xmath128 , with exactly the same partitioning , that is @xmath129 .",
    "the proof is by construction .",
    "if @xmath115 and @xmath128 were the same , the task is trivial .",
    "otherwise , @xmath115 has to be modified in order to satisfy the boundary conditions of @xmath100 .",
    "an example of such process is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cells ] . here",
    ", the first and thirds simulation cells represent @xmath115 and @xmath128 correspondingly .",
    "the second cell depicts an intermediate step of the correctional procedure . here ,",
    "the open segments are connected into a loop along which the boundary spins mismatches are fixed one - by - one .",
    "further details of the algorithm are given below .",
    "proceeding column by column , consider each pair of boundary legs , @xmath130 , to be matched with respect to the new boundary conditions @xmath100 .",
    "if the legs align , @xmath131 , proceed to the next pair . otherwise , randomly choose one of the two legs in the pair .",
    "say it is @xmath132 .",
    "since this leg is located on a boundary slice , it belongs to an open segment .",
    "flip all legs belonging to this segment .",
    "now , the original pair of legs is properly aligned , however there might be another mismatch at the other end of the segment .",
    "call the new pair @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the leg that has just been flipped as part of the open segment . by the same logic as before , @xmath135 must belong to an open segment whose other end is identified as another boundary leg @xmath136 . if @xmath137 , flip this segment in order to align the @xmath138 pair and move on to the next pair @xmath139 .",
    "otherwise , proceed to the same pair without flipping the segment . in this way ,",
    "one - by - one pairs of boundary legs are aligned with respect to @xmath100 boundary condition along a loop of open segments .",
    "an important subtlety occurs at the last step of this algorithm when the last pair @xmath140 is considered .",
    "unlike previously , @xmath141 can not be flipped if those legs do not align .",
    "an attempt to do so would entail another iteration of corrections with the same result , thus , initiating the algorithm in an infinite loop .",
    "however , this does not occur in the xy - model due to the special properties of its vertices .",
    "notice that the only vertex move that connects two anti - aligned legs is the `` switch - and - reverse '' move ( fig.[fig : vertices ] ) ; this is the only move that reverses the vertical directionality of propagation of the segment s head .",
    "consequently , once a segment tracing is initiated with the choice of a leg and its state , the spin state of the leg at the segment s head is determined by the vertical direction that the segment passes through the leg . on the last boundary connection , the direction of motion along the segment must be the same as the initial direction , and therefore the initial spin state at the head of the segment under construction is always the same its final state .",
    "we see then that for any segment partition of @xmath115 , it is always possible to construct a @xmath128 with the same segment partition .    now that we have shown the equivalence between any two configuration spaces constraint by boundary conditions @xmath2 and @xmath100 in terms of the segment partitions , we have achieved our initial goal to find a label @xmath125 that can be used to apply the eq .",
    "[ eq : simple_id ] .",
    "however , we still need to compute the weights of @xmath142 and @xmath143 . upon a close inspection of the inner double sum in eq .  [ eq : xy_part_func_2 ]",
    ", we realize that the same segment partitions can be generated from different vertex configurations .",
    "this degeneracy can be exploited in order to replace the double sum with a single sum : @xmath144 where the inner sum iterates over all unique segment partitions for a given linked list and @xmath145 is the degeneracy of the segment partition labelled as @xmath146 .",
    "as will be shown , the degeneracy depends on the boundary conditions between replicas and , thus , the superscript must be included .    in order to calculate the degeneracy of a segment partition @xmath146 ,",
    "connect open segments using boundary conditions @xmath2 to form @xmath147 loops that cross boundary slices .",
    "in addition to those loops , there are also @xmath148 inner loops ( closed segments ) .",
    "since all those loops do not intersect with each other by construction , the spins within them can be flipped independently .",
    "each combination of the loops flips leads to another vertex configuration .",
    "equivalently , all of those vertex configurations generate the same segment partition @xmath149 .",
    "there are in total @xmath150 loops with each one being in one of two states : flipped or not - flipped .",
    "each combination of those states corresponds to a different vertex configuration . in total",
    ", there are @xmath151 of such combinations which constitutes the degeneracy @xmath145 .    with the last piece of the puzzle in our hands ,",
    "we infer the segment partition weight from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xy_part_func_3 ] ) : @xmath152 since the inner - loops are unaffected by the boundary conditions , upon the substitution of this weight in the eq .",
    "( [ eq : simple_id ] ) their number drops out and an elegant expression is obtained : @xmath153    in practice , this estimator can be implemented in fewer steps that were required to prove its validity .",
    "it requires two routines .",
    "one routine traces out a random single segment partition @xmath146 for a vertex configuration @xmath115 as was outlined before . in order to speed up the execution ,",
    "it is not necessary to identify the closed segments .",
    "the end product of this routine is to associate the pairs of boundary spins that are connected via open segments .",
    "once this step is done , the second routine takes the set of those pairs together with replicas boundary conditions as its inputs .",
    "its task is to count @xmath154 .",
    "this routine is executed for both @xmath2 and @xmath100 with the same open segments . in the end , @xmath155 and @xmath156",
    "are known and the estimator can be evaluated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : estimator ] ) .",
    "to illustrate the efficiency of the new estimator , its raw measurements are compared to the original ratio method @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : methcomp ] , on the 2d xy model of interest in the main text . here",
    ", the deterioration of both estimators statistics is seen as the difference between the partition functions regions a , @xmath157 , grows large .",
    "as the reference values , we employ the results obtained from the ratio trick @xcite , which constitute a compilation of the extended ensemble ( ee ) ratio method results from many different monte carlo simulations , each executed with @xmath158 .",
    "note that the original ratio method results are based on five times more monte carlo sweeps that were involved to produce the ee ratio method results .",
    "even with such advantage , the ratio method statistics becomes increasingly poor towards @xmath159 . after this threshold",
    ", the estimator seems no longer capable to capture any meaningful statistics within the running time of its simulations .",
    "the performance of the ee is strikingly better .",

    "<S> thus , although the method of thermodynamic integration is useful to produce the general shape of the @xmath66 curve for a wide range of temperatures , it is difficult to control the systematic error introduced by numerical integration at low temperatures for @xmath77 . therefore , data used in the below fits was converged at very low temperatures using the extended ensemble ratio method , described in the supplemental material .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : eevslv3 ] illustrates the resulting temperature - converged mutual information for a variety of system sizes , as a function of the `` width '' of the cylindrical region , @xmath78 . since , for a subsystem @xmath2 and its complement @xmath3 , @xmath79 only at @xmath80 , the symmetry of the entanglement entropy about @xmath81 provides a sensitive test of temperature convergence . </S>",
    "<S> employment of the `` bare '' rnyi entropy results in a very slight asymmetry in the curve ; use of @xmath66 restores this symmetry producing high - quality data that can be fitted using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the results of this analysis are illustrated in fig  [ fig : fits2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath66 is calculated at various aspect ratios ( the vertical cuts in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eevslv3 ] ) and fit to the functional form eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ mi ] ) . specifically , to extract the coefficient of the subleading logarithm , the mutual information was fit to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath12 are adjustable fit parameters . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eevslv3 ] ( a ) , there is definative evidence for the existence of a logarithm ; furthermore , independent fits for the four aspect ratios studied each give @xmath84 to within error bars .    </S>",
    "<S> even more striking , we are able to extract the universal shape - dependence of the geometric constant @xmath69 . to do so , fits were performed to the functional form @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is fixed at unity in order to remove one parameter from the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> thus calculated , @xmath69 for @xmath5 in two dimensions can be compared via a zero - parameter fit to the subleading constant term @xmath87 calculated in a free scalar field theory @xcite through the relation @xmath88 , valid for the second rnyi entropy . </S>",
    "<S> the free field result @xmath87 , which depends on the aspect ratio @xmath89 , can be calculated numerically for free bosons on the lattice using the correlation matrix technique ( as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : eevslv3 ] ( b ) , the resulting theoretical curve is in excellent agreement with our qmc results for @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion  _ in this paper , we have employed large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations on the spin-1/2 xy model to demonstrate the presence of a logarithmic correction to the rnyi entropy due to spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this term arises from the presence of two infra - red energy scales in the problem ; the spin - wave gap , and the `` tower of states '' . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient of this logarithm is predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to be @xmath90 , where @xmath86 is the number of goldstone modes and @xmath12 the spatial dimension . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm this prediction in a striking manner , through finite - size scaling studies on the square lattice xy model , recovering to high precision the expected @xmath91 . in order to do so </S>",
    "<S> , a qmc algorithm was developed to sample the second rnyi entropy at a fixed temperature with high efficiency ( described in the supplemental material ) .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in addition to confirming @xmath91 , our simulation technique is able to converge the value of an additional additive geometric constant @xmath69 , which is fully universal since all short - distance physics is confined to the ( known ) spin wave stiffness and velocity , contained within the argument of the logarithm . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath69 has a functional dependence on the geometric aspect ratio of the entangled bipartition . </S>",
    "<S> this function matches , to within error bars , that calculated using a free scalar field theory regularized on a toroidal square lattice , with no adjustable parameters .    this is a rare and striking example of complete quantitative agreement between a universal quantity calculated in continuum field theory and finite - size lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the ability of the rnyi entanglement entropy to mediate between continuum theory and lattice simulation illustrates the utility of such geometric quantities as an alternative paradigm to study correlations in condensed - matter systems . in this case , with the full understanding of the universal structure of the entanglement entropy in the presence of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry , the door is now open to the direct search and detection of goldstone modes in a large variety of systems , through the widely accessible rnyi entropies .      </S>",
