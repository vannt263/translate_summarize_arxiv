    "when @xmath10 is an integral fibration , that is , all its fibers are geometrically integral curves , its relative jacobian is simply the relative moduli space of torsion free rank 1 sheaves of relative degree 0 . in this case , it is known that for any closed point @xmath11 we have an isomorphism @xmath12 between the fibers of both fibrations over @xmath13 .",

    "some of the classic examples of families of calabi - yau manifolds for which there is a greene - plesser @xcite description of the mirror family produced by candelas and others , are elliptic fibrations @xcite .",
    "moreover there is a relative fourier - mukai transform for most elliptic fibrations ( @xcite ) that can be understood in terms of duality in string theory ( @xcite or d - brane theory .",
    "the latter application is due to the interpretation of b - type d - brane states as objects of the derived category @xmath19 of coherent sheaves @xcite and to kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry proposal @xcite that gives an equivalence between @xmath19 and the fukaya category @xcite . according to that proposal",
