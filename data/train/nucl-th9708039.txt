    "studies of extremely neutron - rich nuclei have revealed a number of intriguing new phenomena .",
    "two sets of these nuclei that have received particular attention are those with neutron number @xmath6 in the vicinity of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 shell closures ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) . experimental studies of neutron - rich mg and na isotopes indicate the onset of deformation , as well as the modification of the @xmath11 shell gap for 32 and nearby nuclei @xcite .",
    "inspired by the rich set of phenomena occurring near the @xmath11 shell closure when @xmath12 , attention has been directed to nuclei near the @xmath13 ( sub)shell closure for a number of s and ar isotopes @xcite where similar , but less dramatic , effects have been seen as well .    in parallel with the experimental efforts ,",
    "there have been several theoretical studies seeking to understand and , in some cases , predict properties of these unstable nuclei . both mean - field @xcite and shell - model calculations",
    "@xcite have been proposed .",
    "the latter require a severe truncation to achieve tractable model spaces , since the successful description of these nuclei involves active nucleons in both the @xmath0- and the @xmath1-shells .",
    "the natural basis for the problem is therefore the full @xmath0-@xmath1 space , which puts it out of reach of exact diagonalization on current hardware .",
    "shell - model monte carlo ( smmc ) methods @xcite offer an alternative to direct diagonalization when the bases become very large .",
    "though smmc provides limited detailed spectroscopic information , it can predict , with good accuracy , overall nuclear properties such as masses , total strengths , strength distributions , and deformation  precisely those quantities probed by the recent experiments .",
    "it thus seems natural to apply smmc methods to these unstable neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "two questions will arise  center - of - mass motion and choice of the interaction  that are not exactly new , but demand special treatment in very large spaces",
    ".    the center - of - mass problem concerns momentum conservation .",
    "it was investigated for the first time by elliott and skyrme in 1955  @xcite , and a vast literature on the subject has developed , but as of now , the methods proposed have not managed to reconcile rigor and applicability .",
    "section ii will be devoted to explaining why this is so and to describe how  short of ensuring exact momentum conservation  it is possible within an smmc context to assess the damage and control it in order to perform meaningful calculations .",
    "there has long been a consensus that g - matrices derived from potentials consistent with @xmath14 data @xcite are the natural shell - model choice .",
    "unfortunately , such interactions give results that rapidly deteriorate as the number of particles increases .",
    "two alternative cures have been proposed : sets of fitted matrix elements ( all the shell - model work quoted above ) , or minimal `` monopole '' modifications @xcite .",
    "the latter restricts the fit to far fewer quantities : some average matrix elements , which are the ones that suffer from the bad saturation and shell properties of the realistic potentials .",
    "both approaches have the common shortcoming of needing data to determine the fitted numbers , but recently a general parametrization of the monopole field ( @xmath15 ) has become available that could be used to replace the @xmath16-matrix centroids for any model space  @xcite .",
    "the interaction we present in section iii is the first monopole modified @xmath16-matrix free of parameters other than the six entering the independently derived @xmath15 .",
    "section iv contains results for a number of unstable , neutron - rich nuclei near the @xmath11 and 28 shell closures and compares them to experiment and to other truncated shell - model calculations .",
    "section v is devoted to a discussion of what we have accomplished and surveys further applications of such calculations .",
    "by momentum conservation , a many - body wavefunction must factorize as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the center - of - mass coordinate and @xmath19 the relative ones .",
    "there are formalisms in which the latter are constructed explicitly , but they lead to very hard problems of antisymmetrization . what can be done in a shell - model context",
    "is to work with a basis that ensures that the eigenstates automatically factorize as requested .",
    "this is accomplished by taking @xmath20 to be a harmonic oscillator state , which implies that the basis must produce eigenstates of @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    in order to diagonalize this one - body hamiltonian in the sm basis",
    ", we have to rewrite it using @xmath24 along with a similar expression for the coordinates",
    ". then @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a one - body oscillator spectrum , and @xmath27 an oscillator two - body force .",
    "if one considers the matrix element , it is quite easy to convince oneself  using a general property of the talmi - moshinsky transformation and the oscillator form of @xmath27  that . in other words",
    ", @xmath28 conserves the number of oscillator quanta .",
    "this implies that if a basis contains _ all _ states of ( or up to ) @xmath29excitations , diagonalizing a translationally invariant hamiltonian would ensure the factorization of the center - of - mass wavefunction . to separate the wavefunctions with 0center - of - mass quanta it would be sufficient to do the calculations with @xmath30 choosing a large @xmath31 ( not to be confused with the smmc inverse temperature ) .",
    "thus , the procedure to deal with the center - of - mass problem is conceptually straightforward .",
    "practically , things are not so simple . in 32 , for example , the @xmath0-@xmath1 basis will contain states having between 0 and 16quanta ; however , it is very far from containing them all , and it does not even contain all those of 1 . then , and this point is crucial , the restriction of @xmath28 to the basis * is no longer * @xmath28 .",
    "as a consequence , the prescription in eq .",
    "( [ gl ] ) is no longer a prescription to remove unwanted center - of - mass excitations , but a prescription to remove something else .",
    "still , whatever the restricted @xmath28 is in the model space , it is the operator most closely connected with the true one .",
    "hence , rather than removing unwanted excitations , which is now impossible in general , we may try to assess and control the damage by using eq .",
    "( [ gl ] ) to construct a set of states @xmath32 and see how @xmath33 behaves . since the problem is variational ,",
    "the best we can do is choose a @xmath31 that minimizes the energy .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth going quickly through the history of the subject , under the light of these very elementary considerations which are often ignored , thereby creating unnecessary confusion .",
    "the pioneers of the subject were elliott and skyrme  @xcite who treated a simple case , the 1 @xmath34=@xmath35 excitations on a @xmath36 shell core , showing that one of them ( @xmath37 ) was simply the 1 center - of - mass state .",
    "other early important contributions are  @xcite .",
    "the first cross - shell calculation in a full space appeared in 1968  @xcite : @xmath38 , which successfully accounted for the spectra in the region around @xmath39o . the @xmath40 state contained a spurious component of 5.556% of the elliott - skyrme state . nonetheless , gloeckner and lawson  @xcite decided to apply eq .",
    "( [ gl ] ) with an arbitrarily large @xmath31 to eliminate the spurious components ; by not realizing that @xmath28 restricted to that small space generated very little center - of - mass excitations and many genuine ones , they managed to eliminate the latter rather than the former . in spite of the criticism that ensued  @xcite showing that the procedure could not possibly make sense ( except in complete spaces )",
    ", no formally satisfactory arguments were advanced to replace it .",
    "equation  ( [ gl ] ) remained a guide on where to begin to minimize the center - of - mass nuisance , and it is indeed the basis of our variational suggestion .",
    "new projection techniques have been developed @xcite , but they rely on explicit construction of the spurious states and they are not applicable in smmc .    the recipe advocated by whitehead _ et al . _",
    "@xcite seems quite compatible with the constrained variation sketched above , and we have adopted it , since it proves sufficient to optimize the solutions .",
    "the idea is to add @xmath31to , but with @xmath31 remaining fairly small .",
    "we have found that @xmath41 works reasonably well .",
    "this value will push spurious components up in energy by @xmath42 mev @xmath43 mev while leaving the desired components relatively unscathed",
    ". a smaller value of @xmath31 leaves the spurious configurations at low enough energies that they are included in the monte carlo sampling , while larger values of @xmath31 ( @xmath44 ) begin to remove the entire @xmath1 shell from the calculation and artificially truncate the space .",
    "technically , suffers from the sign problem , and we have to say a word about it .",
    "smmc methods reduce the imaginary - time , many - body evolution operator to a coherent superposition of one - body evolutions in fluctuating one - body fields .",
    "this reduction is achieved via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation and the resulting path integral is evaluated stochastically .",
    "smmc methods have been applied to numerous full - basis 0studies .",
    "the primary difficulty in these applications arises from a sign problem due to the repulsive part of effective nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "a practical solution to this sign problem was obtained by considering a set of hamiltonians close to the desired realistic hamiltonian ( @xmath45 ) and extrapolating to the realistic case @xcite .",
    "this technique has been validated in numerous studies that show the smmc approach to be a viable and productive avenue to study extremely large many - body problems @xcite .",
    "the original sign problem for realistic interactions was solved by breaking the two - body interaction into `` good '' ( without a sign problem ) and `` bad '' ( with a sign problem ) parts : @xmath46 . the bad part",
    "is then multiplied by a parameter , @xmath47 , with values typically lying in the range @xmath48 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath49 has no sign problem for @xmath47 in this range .",
    "the function @xmath50 is used to help in extrapolations .",
    "it is constructed such that @xmath51 , and takes the form @xmath52 $ ] , with @xmath53 .",
    "the smmc observables are evaluated for a number of different negative @xmath47-values and the true observables are obtained by extrapolation to @xmath54 .",
    "if we fix the sign problem in the same manner as above for we are no longer dealing with a hamiltonian that pushes _ all _ spurious components to higher energies  some components might even be lowered for @xmath55 .",
    "we will see shortly that this is not a real problem .",
    "we typically choose a minimal extrapolation ( linear , quadratic , etc . ) in the extrapolation parameter that gives a @xmath56 per datum of @xmath57 .",
    "in much of our work most quantities extrapolate either linearly or quadratically .",
    "we measure the center - of - mass contamination by calculating the expectation value of @xmath28 . in fig .  1a",
    ", we show the value of @xmath58 in 32 for several different values of @xmath31 .",
    "mev with @xmath59  mev@xmath60 .",
    "these values have been shown to be sufficient to isolate the ground state for even - even nuclei .",
    "for all data presented here 4096 samples were taken at each value of the extrapolation parameter , @xmath47 . ]",
    "it is apparent that @xmath61@xmath62 decreases as @xmath31 increases .",
    "we also find that near @xmath63 , @xmath64 mev showing that the center - of - mass contamination is minimal . note that at approximately @xmath65 the average of the two different techniques of extrapolation presented in fig .",
    "1a give @xmath66  mev , and the calculations could be fine tuned for each nucleus to obtain this value .",
    "figure 1a contains two different data sets corresponding to two different methods of extrapolating @xmath67 to the physical case ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the solid circles show the results of a simple linear extrapolation where for this observable @xmath56 per datum is approximately 1 .",
    "it has been established @xcite that @xmath68 obeys a variational principle such that the extrapolating curve must have a minimum ( slope = 0 ) at the physical value ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "as we sample values of the quantity @xmath70 , it is perhaps reasonable to extrapolate @xmath71 using this constraint as well ( if @xmath72 were truly separable , this would be an exact procedure ) . a cubic extrapolation embodying this constraint corresponds to the open circles in fig .",
    "we may further evaluate our extrapolation procedures by comparing smmc and the standard shell - model results in @xmath73 mg . shown in fig .",
    "2a is a detailed comparison for the expectation of the energy @xmath74 , and in fig .",
    "2b a comparison for @xmath75 .",
    "the standard shell - model results were obtained using the code antoine @xcite .",
    "the smmc results in fig .",
    "2a employ a constrained fit , such that @xmath76 .",
    "the slight deviation from the standard shell model at @xmath77 is due to increasing interaction matrix elements ( with @xmath47 ) , while @xmath78 , the imaginary time step , is kept fixed .",
    "this deviation is also seen in fig .",
    ". note that in fig .",
    "2b neither the constrained fit nor the linear fit ( both with @xmath56 per datum @xmath57 ) give a precise description of the standard shell - model results at @xmath69 .",
    "an average of the two ways of extrapolation as indicated by the solid line on fig .",
    "2b , apparently gives the more precise result , and we shall do this for other @xmath28 values quoted throughout this paper .",
    "the error bar for such an averaged result is given by adding in quadrature the individual errors of both extrapolations .",
    "1b we show the evolution of the total @xmath4 and in fig .",
    "1c we show the occupation of the @xmath0-shell and the @xmath79-shell as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "note that the occupation of the @xmath79 orbit decreases as @xmath31 increases .",
    "this is due to a combination of the removal of actual center - of - mass excitations and the `` pushing up '' in energy of the real states .",
    "the @xmath4 decreases slowly with @xmath31 , although the uncertainties are consistent with a constant .",
    "however , the decrease , particularly at @xmath80 , is likely to be real since we are working in an incomplete @xmath29model space . at extremely large values of @xmath31",
    "we would remove the @xmath1 shell from the calculation and return to the pure @xmath0-shell result , which is substantially smaller than the result shown here .",
    "the slow evolution of the @xmath4 with @xmath31 does open the intriguing possibility of studying @xmath4s with an interaction that has no sign problem ( e.g. pairing + quadrupole ) and no center - of - mass correction with the hope of obtaining reasonable results .    somewhere between @xmath81 and 5",
    ", @xmath82 begins to change so strongly as a function of @xmath47 that our extrapolations become unreliable and we can extract no useful information . by @xmath83 , the extrapolated values become completely unreasonable , and numerical noise completely swamps the calculation .",
    "we thus conclude that a safe value for a generic study is @xmath84 , although for a given nucleus this value may be fine tuned to nearly eliminate all center - of - mass contamination from the statistical observables .",
    "this may be done in future studies .",
    "numerous shell - model studies have been carried out in truncated model spaces for neutron - rich nuclei near @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the number of @xmath0-@xmath1 shell effective interactions used almost exceeds the number of papers , but there are similarities between them .",
    "a common feature is wildenthal s usd interaction @xcite to describe the pure @xmath0 shell part of the problem .",
    "all also use some corrected version of the original kuo - brown ( kb ) @xmath16-matrix interaction @xcite to describe nucleons in the @xmath1 shell .",
    "the cross - shell interaction is handled in one of two different ways : matrix elements are generated via a @xmath16-matrix or via the millener - kurath potential . as is common in this type of calculation ,",
    "selected two - body matrix elements and single - particle energies have been adjusted to obtain agreement with experiment . as these interactions have been produced for use in highly truncated spaces ( usually with only @xmath85 neutron excitations to the @xmath1-shell ) , they are not suitable for use in the full space .",
    "we found that they generally scatter too many particles from the @xmath0 to the @xmath1 shell , and that the @xmath4 values can not be consistently calculated .",
    "we are not saying that the interactions are wrong , but that we did not succeed in adapting them to the full space .",
    "perhaps it can be done , but it would be of limited interest ; the years of experience these forces embody can not be transposed to other spaces , as the @xmath1-@xmath86 shells for instance , where detailed fits are unthinkable .",
    "therefore , we derived a new effective interaction for the region : a monopole corrected renormalized @xmath16-matrix , derived from a modern potential .",
    "as noted in section i , if @xmath16-matrices have not been widely used , it is because they were thought to be so flawed as to serve at best as input parameters to overall fits , as in the case of the famous usd interaction @xcite .",
    "however , it had been pointed out twenty years ago @xcite that practically all the problems of the kb interaction amounted to the failure to produce the @xmath87 closure , and could be corrected by changing at most four centroids of the interaction .",
    "a perturbative treatment in the beginning of the @xmath1 shell using these modifications ( the kb3 interaction ) gave good results @xcite , and when the antoine code became available @xcite , the results became truly excellent ( @xcite and references therein ) . in the meantime , it was confirmed in other regions that the only trouble with the @xmath16-matrices resided in their centroids , i.e. , in the bad saturation and shell formation properties of the realistic potentials  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the interaction was excellent , and strongly dominated by collective terms ( pairing and quadrupole mainly ) @xcite .",
    "we say interaction and not interactions , because all the realistic ones produce very similar good multipole matrix elements , and similar monopole failures . the outstanding problem is to replace case by case modifications by a general specification of @xmath15 , the monopole field , that yields all the centroids once and for all .",
    "in subsection b we shall describe the proposed solution @xcite we have adopted .",
    "there is great advantage in the smmc context to adopt the schematic collective multipole hamiltonian ( @xmath88 ) of @xcite , because its main terms have good signs , thereby eliminating extrapolation uncertainties ; however , it may be a premature step .",
    "for one thing , it has not been established yet that in the light nuclei the collective contribution is sufficient to give high - quality results , a project better left to exact diagonalizations where fine details may be better probed .",
    "furthermore , the renormalization treatment in @xcite is somewhat crude .",
    "a more complete treatment might yield significant differences .",
    "this could be true even though potentials consistent with the @xmath14 data yield very similar collective contributions and are therefore reasonably well fitted even by older potentials . finally , even if it were true that realistic interactions are interchangeable , and that a crude treatment of renormalization was adequate , there would certainly be no objection to using the best forces and the most sophisticated renormalizations available . in practice",
    "this is what we do here .      in order to obtain a microscopic effective shell - model interaction which spans both the @xmath7 and the @xmath89 shells ,",
    "our many - body scheme starts with a free nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath90 which is appropriate for nuclear physics at low and intermediate energies . at present",
    "there are several potentials available .",
    "the most recent versions of machleidt and co - workers @xcite , the nimjegen group @xcite , and the argonne group @xcite have a @xmath56 per datum close to @xmath91 with respect to the nijmegen database @xcite . the potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite is an extension of the one - boson - exchange models of the bonn group @xcite , where mesons like @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and the fictitious @xmath97 meson are included . in the charge - dependent version of ref .",
    "@xcite , the first five mesons have the same set of parameters for all partial waves , whereas the parameters of the @xmath97 meson are allowed to vary .",
    "the recent argonne potential @xcite is also a charge - dependent version of the argonne @xmath98 @xcite potential .",
    "the argonne potential models are local potentials in coordinate space and include a @xmath92-exchange plus parametrizations of the short - range and intermediate - range part of the potential .",
    "the nimjegen group @xcite has constructed potentials based on meson exchange and models parametrized in similars ways as the argonne potentials .",
    "another important difference between , e.g. , the bonn potentials and the argonne and nimjegen potentials is the strength of the much debated tensor force @xcite .",
    "typically , the bonn potentials have a smaller @xmath99-state admixture in the deuteron wave function than the argonne and nimjegen potentials , as well as other potential models . a smaller ( larger ) @xmath99-state admixture in the ground state of the deuteron",
    "means that the tensor force is weaker ( stronger ) .",
    "the strength of the tensor force has important consequences in calculations of the binding energy for both finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter ( see , e.g. , the discussion in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "a potential model with a weak tensor force tends to yield more attraction in a nuclear system than a potential with a strong tensor force ; however , all these modern nucleon - nucleon interactions yield very similar excitation spectra . moreover , in calculations of feynman - goldstone diagrams in perturbation theory , a potential with a weak tensor force tends to suppress certain intermediate states of long - range character , like particle - hole excitations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we choose to work with the charge - dependent version of the bonn potential models , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the next step in our many - body scheme is to handle the fact that the repulsive core of the nucleon - nucleon potential @xmath90 is unsuitable for perturbative approaches .",
    "this problem is overcome by introducing the reaction matrix @xmath16 given by the solution of the bethe - goldstone equation @xmath100 where @xmath96 is the unperturbed energy of the interacting nucleons , and @xmath101 is the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the projection operator @xmath102 , commonly referred to as the pauli operator , prevents the interacting nucleons from scattering into states occupied by other nucleons . in this work",
    ", we solve the bethe - goldstone equation for several starting energies @xmath103 , by way of the so - called double - partitioning scheme discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the closed - shell core in the @xmath16-matrix calculation",
    "we choose @xmath39o and employ a harmonic - oscillator basis for the single - particle wave functions , with an oscillator energy @xmath104 given by @xmath105 mev , @xmath106 being the mass number .",
    "finally , we briefly sketch how to calculate an effective two - body interaction for the chosen model space in terms of the @xmath16-matrix . since the @xmath16-matrix represents just the summation to all orders of ladder diagrams with particle - particle diagrams , there are obviously other terms which need to be included in an effective interaction .",
    "long - range effects represented by core - polarizations terms are also needed .",
    "the first step then is to define the so - called @xmath107-box given by @xmath108 the @xmath107-box is made up of non - folded diagrams which are irreducible and valence linked .",
    "we can then obtain an effective interaction @xmath109 in terms of the @xmath107-box with @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 refer to the effective interaction after @xmath29 and @xmath113 iterations .",
    "the zeroth iteration is represented by just the @xmath107-box .",
    "observe also that the effective interaction @xmath114 is evaluated at a given model space energy @xmath96 , as is the case for the @xmath16-matrix as well .",
    "here we choose @xmath115 mev .",
    "the final interaction is obtained after folding results in eigenvalues which depend rather weakly on the chosen starting energy ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "all non - folded diagrams through second - order in the interaction @xmath16 are included .",
    "for further details , see ref .",
    "finally , the reader should note that when one defines an effective interaction for several shells , the effective interaction may be strongly non - hermitian .",
    "this non - hermiticity should arise already at the level of the @xmath16-matrix .",
    "however , since the @xmath16-matrix is calculated at a fixed starting energy for both incoming and outgoing states , it is by construction hermitian .",
    "since we are calculating an effective interaction at a fixed starting energy , the individual diagrams entering the definition of the @xmath107-box are thereby also made hermitian .",
    "the non - hermiticity which stems from folded diagrams is made explicitly hermitian through the approach of suzuki _",
    "_ in ref.@xcite",
    ".      as results concerning the monopole field are scattered through many papers  @xcite , the most relevant of which is not yet published  @xcite , this subsection offers a compact presentation of the main ideas .",
    "the centroids we have often mentioned are  in a neutron proton ( np ) representation  the average matrix elements @xmath116 where @xmath117 stands for neutrons or protons in orbits @xmath118 _ respectively_. technically , the monopole field @xmath15 is that part of the interaction containing all the quadratic two - body forms in scalar products of fermion operators @xmath119 ( same parity for @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) .",
    "the clean extraction of these forms from the total @xmath45 ( i.e. , the separation @xmath122 , @xmath123 for multipole ) is not altogether trivial @xcite .",
    "it is conceptually important because it makes @xmath15 closed under unitary transformations of the @xmath124 operators , and therefore closed under spherical hartree - fock variation .",
    "the expectation values we may want to vary are those of the @xmath125 , the diagonal part of @xmath15 in a given basis . calling @xmath126 the @xmath127-number operator for orbit @xmath120 , we obtain @xmath128 a standard result ( it is the extraction of the non diagonal terms that is more complicated ) .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath125 for any state is the average energy of the configuration to which it belongs ( a configuration is a set of states with fixed @xmath126 for each orbit ) . in particular",
    ", @xmath125 reproduces the exact energy of closed shells ( @xmath129 ) and single - particle ( or hole ) states built on them ( @xmath130 ) , since for this set ( @xmath131 ) each configuration contains a single member .",
    "consequently , it is uncontaminated by direct configuration mixing . as an example , in @xmath132ni , the two - body ( no coulomb ) contribution to the binding energy in the @xmath1 shell is approximately 73 mev , and configuration mixing ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) is responsible for only 5 mev ; the rest is monopole .",
    "if we compare to the _ total _ binding of 484 mev , it is clear that the monopole part becomes overwhelming , even allowing for substantial cross shell mixing ( which , incidentally is included in the present calculations )",
    ".    therefore , @xmath125 is responsible entirely for the bulk @xmath133 and surface energies @xmath134 , and for a very large part of the shell effects [ @xmath135 , i.e. , the 73 mev ]",
    ". there can be little doubt this is where the trouble comes in the realistic potentials .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the idea in @xcite is to fit @xmath125 to the @xmath136 set , the single - particle and single - hole spectra around doubly magic nuclei .",
    "it is assumed that the bulk and surface terms can be separated , and by cancelling the kinetic energy , @xmath137 is the number of particles in harmonic oscillator ( ho ) shell @xmath138 , against the collective monopole term @xcite , the leading term in @xmath15 . defining",
    ", one obtains an expression of order @xmath135 that has strong shell effects producing the ho closures . to this one adds @xmath139 and @xmath140 one - body terms that produce the observed splittings around ho closures .",
    "the filling order is now established , and as the largest orbit  which comes lowest  is full , it alters significantly the splitting of its neighbors ( e.g. , the spectrum of @xmath141ni is totally different from that of @xmath142ca ) . this is taken care of by strictly two - body terms . with a total of six parameters ( two for the @xmath143 part , and four for the two - body contributions ) ,",
    "the fit yields an @xmath144 deviation of 220 kev for 90 data points .",
    "all terms have a common scaling in = @xmath145 , obtained using a very accurate fit to the radii @xmath146 , where @xmath147 note that due to this scaling it is possible to use the same functional form from @xmath148 to @xmath149 .",
    "figure [ f : shell ] shows the mechanism of shell formation for nuclei with @xmath150 .",

    "this problem was treated artificially in the old version through a single - particle mechanism that was discarded in the calculations , mainly because keeping it would have demanded a readjustment of the interaction for each nucleus  an unwanted complication in a feasibility study such as this one . as a consequence",

    "we return to this issue in section iv .",
    "the analysis of binding energies is a delicate exercise because external parameters have to be introduced .",
    "the philosophy behind @xmath15 is to make all calculations _",
    "coreless_. because of the propagation ( which should be extended to @xmath88 ) , nuclei readjust their sizes and energies as @xmath6 and @xmath183 change .",
    "if the bulk terms are added , there is , in principle , no need to fit anything , and the calculated energies are absolute  not referred to any core . in the present calculations",
    "the interaction was kept fixed , and the way to proceed is the traditional one , by referring all energies to the core of @xmath39o .",
    "first , we estimate coulomb effects using @xmath184 , and then fit @xmath185 it is generally assumed that @xmath186 should be close to the single - particle energy of @xmath187o ( -4.14 mev ) , and that the quadratic terms are the average @xmath188 over the space ( from eq .",

    "the contribution to @xmath189 from @xmath188 is relatively small .",
    "the symmetry energy must be counted as one of the bulk terms , and the best we can do is to take it from fits to the binding energies , which yield consistently similar numbers . from @xcite",
    "we adopt the form , where the main term has been reduced by the approximately 6 mev coming from @xmath15 .",
    "we can not change these parameters ; we can only check that the fit to @xmath190 yields a @xmath189 consistent with them .",
    "but there is subtlety : the isospin term vanishes at @xmath191 because it is taken to be two - body , while @xmath192 gives a substantial 1.15 mev contribution at @xmath187o .",
    "therefore , to use the form of @xmath190 , @xmath186 must be @xmath192-corrected ( in the same sense that we coulomb - correct ) to   -4.14 - 1.15=-5.29 mev . for @xmath189 we must take some average @xmath192 , which we choose to be the value at @xmath193 , i.e. , @xmath194 .",
    "finally for @xmath195 we must expect a small value , since it should come entirely from @xmath15 .",
    "the fit yields ( in mev ) @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and a @xmath56 per degree of freedom of @xmath199 . while @xmath186 and @xmath189 are very comfortably close to our expectations , @xmath195 is much too large .",
    "but that is not a problem : the program that transforms @xmath15 into @xmath200 had been thoroughly checked for excitation energies but not for binding energies .",
    "it had a bug in it that accounts for nearly -250 kev in the @xmath195 term .",
    "hence , when @xmath192 is taken into account and the bug is corrected , the fit becomes ( in _ kev _ ) @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 .",

    "second , if spurious center - of - mass contamination were a severe problem , we would expect to see a larger proton @xmath79 population for these nuclei due to the @xmath227-@xmath8 `` transition '' mediated by the center - of - mass creation operator .",

    "generally , one also sees an increase in the proton - proton pairs as @xmath254 is increased .",
    "notice also that a fair amount of increase occurs in the sulfur and argonne isotope chains as one adds neutrons .",
    "this is not the case in the two mg isotopes calculated , in which we see a significant increase in the neutron - neutron correlations , but very little change in the proton - proton sector .",
    "this holds for both the ne and mg chains @xcite . for the heavier isotopes in the region , in general , the @xmath252 neutron - neutron pairs",
    "are not significantly enhanced for the nuclei that we have calculated here .",
    "since there are many more particles and hence more pairing , one expects enhancements to occur in higher @xmath235 pairs since the total number of pairs is a conserved quantity for a given number of like nucleons .",
    "we also calculated the pairing in the same channels , but with negative parity ( @xmath255 ) , and find it to be rather small in most cases .",
    "further insight into the pairing comes by considering diagonal elements of the pair matrix before and after diagonalization .",

    "we see from the left panel that adding four neutrons to the system increases the @xmath176-shell neutron matrix elements , while rearranging the @xmath0-shell elements slightly .",
    "> from the occupation numbers we know that the neutrons are filling @xmath1-shell orbitals , and therefore we expect little movement in the @xmath0 shell .",
    "the proton matrix elements are slightly affected by the addition of the neutrons , although there is some movement of protons out of the @xmath79 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the neutron - neutron pair matrix , as shown in the right panel in fig .",
    "[ f : fig6 ] , is about 1.5 times that of the next largest eigenvalue .",
    "however , the remaining eigenvalues are significant .",
    "thus it is unlikely that there exists a pure pair condensate in the neutrons . as a further check on this conclusion",
    ", we have diagonalized the 3@xmath2573 pairing matrix resulting from only the @xmath0-shell neutrons in these two nuclei .",
    "we find that the three eigenvalues are all of similar size and significantly smaller than the largest eigenvalue from the full @xmath0-@xmath1 diagonalization .",
    "thus , what neutron pair condensate does exist is a phenomenon which involves the entire model space , not just the @xmath0 shell . in the proton sector",
    "we see a similar level of pair condensation .",
    "since the protons occupy mainly the @xmath0-shell , only three eigenvalues are large enough to be represented in the figure .",
    "the aim of a nuclear structure calculation is to compare with , or predict , experimental results . in the present case ,",
    "the comparison with other calculations is at least of equal interest .",
    "the reason comes from the problems created by truncations , in particular the ( 0 + 2)``catastrophe '' @xcite , discovered long ago in a 0context  @xcite . calling @xmath258 the @xmath79 shell and @xmath120 its @xmath1 partners generically , an @xmath259 calculation can produce very sensible results ; @xmath260 improves them considerably , but @xmath261 is invariably disastrous , because the @xmath259 configuration is strongly pushed down by pairing with @xmath262 , while @xmath263 does not benefit from a similar push from @xmath264 .",
    "the remarkable thing is that when this last configuration is included , the results are not too different from the original @xmath260 .",
    "if the space is expanded , there is an attenuated 4catastrophy .",
    "the process continues in increasingly attenuated form until the exact @xmath265 space is reached .",
    "this is a general problem with truncations , and for nuclei such as @xmath5 mg with a @xmath266 ground state , where the calculations demand also the presence of @xmath267 states , the adopted solution has been simply to ignore the mixing between the two configurations .",
    "it works very well .",
    "but is it true ?",
    "could it not be possible that higher excitations play an important role ?",
    "to everybody s relief we can say that the present calculations confirm the basic validity of previous work . in all the cases we analyzed ,",
    "the `` dressing '' process , whereby a dominant configuration becomes the exact ground state , does not seem to affect strongly its basic properties .",
    "does it mean that exact calculations are unnecessary ? not exactly .",
    "for one thing , they have no parameters other than those of @xmath15 and therefore demonstrate the validity of the monopole corrected @xmath16-matrices .",
    "and then they go  for the first time in a shell - model context  to the heart of the problem of cross - shell correlations . at present ,",
    "we know little about these problems , except that they hide so well that they are difficult to detect .",
    "still , they can be seen through effects ( such as quenching of gamow  teller strength ) that tell us that they are important .",
    "the available evidence points to a much reduced discontinuity at the fermi level with respect to the naive shell model @xcite . in table",
    "[ t : tab3 ] we find nearly normal occupancies for high @xmath2 , but strong effects for @xmath268 ground states , in particular for @xmath229ti  a truly interesting case .",

    "[ t : tab1 ] the result is at least 20% larger .",
    "this is a good example of the hiding talents of the correlations .",
    "no doubt this nucleus is a _ bona fide _ member of the @xmath1 space , and the correlation effects can be drowned in the experimental error , but it is not always the case .",
    "the region is plagued with be2 transitions which are systematically too large for the 0calculations to explain , particularly for the ca isotopes , which should be the simplest nuclei , but are the most complicated .",
    "in @xmath229ti we have a first example of what a complete calculation could do .",
    "binding energies are no doubt one of the best ways to shed light on the matter . in section",
    "iii.c we mentioned the cross - shell gap around @xmath155ca , which should be increased by about 2 mev , which means that the correlation energy should be much larger . and",
    "since we know now that we can trust smmc with a good interaction to within 1 mev , probably it will not take long before we know more about this supposedly closed nucleus that is not so closed .",
    "this paper was meant as a feasibility study of smmc calculations in multi - spaces .",
    "two general issues had to be tackled : translational invariance and the definition of an interaction .",
    "concerning the first , it was shown that the trouble caused by center - of - mass excitations can be successfully mitigated by a judicious application of ideas in @xcite , and a possible variational approach to the problem was suggested .",
    "the interaction chosen was a @xmath16-matrix derived from a modern potential , renormalized according to state - of - the - art techniques , and monopole - corrected for the bad saturation properties of the existing @xmath14 potentials .",
    "the only parameters entering the calculations are the six `` universal '' constants specifying the monopole hamiltonian , which was shown to explain quite naturally the shell formation properties of high isospin nuclei in the @xmath254=30 - 50 region .",
    "the feasibility test was passed satisfactorily .",
    "binding energies , @xmath4 rates , and gamow  teller strengths were obtained that are in reasonable agreement with observations , and the possible origin of the remaining discrepancies has been identified .",
    "the calculations support the validity of previous work in the region , and open the way to the study of the elusive deep correlations at the origin of gamow  teller quenching . in particular it provides an example , in @xmath229ti , of an extremely correlated system whose behavior is quite similar to that of the uncorrelated one .",
    "the possibility to obtain orbit occupancies should help in advancing the study of the discontinuity at the fermi surface  one of the most difficult problems in nuclear physics .",
    "interest was focused on neutron - rich nuclei around @xmath27220,28 ( a region of current interest ) , where new data has become available and many calculations have been performed .",
