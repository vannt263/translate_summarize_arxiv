    "perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been successful in interpreting and predicting spin - averaged scattering cross sections at large momentum transfer .",
    "since quarks and gluons carry spin , we expect qcd to apply to hard spin - dependent scattering as well .",
    "however , high energy experiments with polarized beam and/or target have provided many theoretical challenges .",
    "for example , data on the spin asymmetries in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of polarized leptons on polarized hadrons @xcite sparked a wave of theoretical effort in understanding the nature of the nucleon s spin @xcite .",
    "a spin asymmetry is the difference of two polarized cross sections , with opposite directions of polarization , divided by their sum .",
    "asymmetries can be obtained with both beams ( or beam and target ) polarized or only one beam ( or target ) polarized .",
    "the former is a double spin asymmetry , and the latter a single spin asymmetry .",
    "depending on the direction of the polarization , we can have longitudinal - spin asymmetries , if the polarization is along the beam direction , and/or transverse - spin asymmetries , when the spin is polarized perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "because of parity and time - reversal invariance , single longitudinal - spin asymmetries for single - particle inclusive production vanish for the strong interactions . however , experimentally - significant single transverse - spin asymmetries have been observed in @xmath1 production , as well as pion production , for almost twenty years @xcite .",
    "these single transverse - spin asymmetries are of the order of ten or more percent of the unpolarized cross section . experimental results on pion production",
    "have been very consistent , and the effects persist to pion transverse momenta of several gev , into the hard - scattering region , where perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) has had success in describing spin - averaged cross sections @xcite .",
    "the extension of the pqcd formalism to spin - dependent cross sections , however , has not been completely straightforward .",
    "it was pointed out long ago @xcite that qcd perturbation theory predicts vanishing single transverse - spin asymmetries at high @xmath2 .",
    "efremov and teryaev later pointed out that a nonvanishing single transverse - spin asymmetry can be obtained in pqcd if one goes beyond the leading power @xcite .",
    "however , the relatively large size and peaking in the forward direction of observed effects remained a difficulty @xcite .    some time ago , using the example of hadronic direct photon production @xcite , we demonstrated that single transverse - spin asymmetries can be consistently evaluated in terms of generalized factorization theorems in perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "the asymmetries are presented as a sum of terms , each of which consists of a convolution of a twist-2 parton distribution from the unpolarized hadron , a twist-3 quark - gluon correlation function from the polarized hadron , and a short - distance partonic hard part calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "the twist-3 quark - gluon correlation functions reflect the interaction of quarks with the color field of the hadron @xcite . in order to test this formalism",
    ", we need to have more than one physical process to extract information on these new and fundamental correlation functions , and to test their universality .",
    "recent work has explored their role in the drell - yan process @xcite . in this paper , we will not explore the physical interpretation of the correlation functions beyond what is currently in the literature .",
    "rather , we concentrate on the extension of the formalism to pion production .    in the forward region for pion production , where @xmath0 is large",
    ", we shall argue that leading contributions to the asymmetry depend on only one twist-3 matrix element ( given in eq .",
    "( [ s3e18 ] ) below ) , which couples two quark fields and one gluon field strength .",
    "this is the same matrix element that gives the leading contribution to single transverse - spin asymmetries in direct photon production @xcite . with a simple model for this twist-3 matrix element",
    ", we show that significant asymmetries can be generated , and that the asymmetries increase naturally as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "our simple model has two parameters : one for the normalization , and the other for the relative sign between the up and down quark correlation functions . extrapolating from measured single transverse - spin asymmetries in @xmath3 and @xmath4 production in proton(@xmath5)-proton collisions @xcite , we fix these two parameters in our model",
    ". we can then derive both the sign and shape of the asymmetries for @xmath6 production , as well as pion production in collisions with a polarized antiproton beam .",
    "our results are consistent with data from fermilab experiments .",
    "the model then predicts the normalization , @xmath0 and transverse - momentum dependence of the asymmetries at higher energies .",
    "these predictions can be tested at rhic .",
    "the naive expectation for the twist-3 asymmetry , @xmath7 , is @xmath8 , with @xmath9 a nonperturbative scale from the twist-3 matrix element and @xmath10 the transverse momentum of the observed particle .",
    "a pure @xmath11 dependence , however , decreases quickly as @xmath10 increases , and becomes ill - defined when @xmath10 is small .",
    "consequently , one might worry that the range of @xmath10 where the asymmetry is not too small , while @xmath10 is large enough to use pqcd , is very limited , and that the region to study twist-3 physics might be too limited to be interesting .",
    "in fact , we shall see below that single transverse - spin asymmetries are a very good observable to study twist-3 physics perturbatively .",
    "in contrast to the naive expectation , for the kinematics of the fermilab data , the @xmath8 contribution to @xmath7 is not the dominant source of the asymmetry . from dimensional analysis alone ,",
    "the asymmetry @xmath7 admits two types of contributions , which are proportional to @xmath12 as well as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 mandelstam variables .",
    "their relative contributions can be determined by perturbative calculation . for large @xmath0 , where the asymmetry is large experimentally , @xmath14 is larger than @xmath15 , but we shall show in this paper that the coefficient for the @xmath16 term is much larger than that of the @xmath8 term in this region ( see eq .",
    "( [ s4e8 ] ) ) . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , the transverse momentum dependence of the asymmetry is actually quite mild for @xmath10 from less than 2 up to 6 gev at @xmath17 , where much of the fermilab data were collected .",
    "this conclusion is very encouraging for future applications of perturbative qcd beyond the level of leading twist .",
    "our method and results can be generalized to single transverse - spin asymmetries in other single particle production . with the extracted information on twist-3 matrix elements",
    ", we can predict both the sign and magnitude of single transverse - spin asymmetries for any inclusive single - particle production , such as for direct photons , kaons , or other hadrons .",
    "related work on single - spin asymmetries involves the incorporation of parton transverse momenta , either in parton distributions @xcite or fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "there is considerable evidence that at transverse momenta in the range of a few gev ,  @xmath18-smearing \"",
    "effects can be important @xcite in spin - averaged cross sections .",
    "it would seem natural to include them in the same range for single - spin asymmetries as well . whether they should be thought of as the dynamical source of the asymmetry remains to be seen .",
    "the fragmentation analysis requires the introduction of  chiral - odd \" distribution functions @xcite , which combine with the leading - twist transversity function @xcite to produce nonvanishing asymmetries .",
    "we shall discuss how these effects can arise in the context of twist-3 factorization theorems , but our explicit models will be based for simplicity on chiral - even parton distributions only .",
    "the twist - three analysis described here is in some sense a minimalist approach , depending on only light - cone variables , which we hope can serve as a benchmark for models which include models of both light - cone and transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "other descriptions of single - spin asymmetries are based on multiquark interactions @xcite and orbital motion @xcite .",
    "interesting comparisons of different approaches may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we define single transverse - spin asymmetries in single particle production in hadronic collisions . we introduce generalized factorization formulas for the asymmetries , identify terms that we expect to dominate in the large-@xmath0 region , review the factorization procedure at twist - three and leading order , and recall the leading - order spin - averaged cross sections to which we compare . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we present our explicit calculations of single transverse - spin asymmetries in hadronic pion production .",
    "we express these asymmetries in terms of short - distance partonic cross sections ( coefficient functions ) , calculated in perturbative qcd , and non - perturbative twist-3 matrix elements . using a simple model for the twist-3 matrix elements",

    "[ sec:5 ] , we give a summary of our results , and an outlook for the subject .",
    "we have also included an appendix , in which we review the application of parity and time reversal symmetry , and identify the list of chiral - even and chiral - odd twist-3 distributions and fragmentation functions that can contribute to the single - spin asymmetry for pion production .",
    "single spin asymmetries are introduced for reactions in which only one particle is polarized . for example , consider single - particle inclusive production in a high energy collision , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the initial particles , with @xmath20 polarized , where @xmath22 is the observed particle ( say , a pion ) of momentum @xmath23 , and where @xmath24 represents all other particles in the final state . in order to fix the kinematics , we choose the center of mass frame of the incoming hadrons , with the @xmath25-axis along the momentum of the polarized hadron .",

    ", we will concentrate on single transverse - spin asymmetries in the forward region ( i.e. , large @xmath0 ) where the asymmetries are largest @xcite .    due to the symmetries of fundamental interactions , it is possible to have a vanishing single transverse - spin asymmetry , even though the corresponding total cross section @xmath35 itself is finite .",
    "for example , it was pointed out by christ and lee over 30 years ago @xcite that time - reversal invariance forbids single transverse - spin asymmetries in inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) to lowest order in @xmath43 .",
    "let us review the reason .",
    "consider a general inclusive lepton - hadron deep - inelastic scattering , which is the analog of eq .",

    "( [ s2e10 ] ) and in the third the symmetry of @xmath52 when the lepton is unpolarized . from eqs .",
    "( [ s2e4 ] ) and ( [ s2e11 ] ) , it is clear that the single transverse - spin asymmetry for inclusive deep - inelastic scattering , @xmath57 , vanishes to lowest order in @xmath43 .    in hadron - hadron scattering , in contrast , the presence of multiple ( initial - state or final - state ) interactions prevents a simple decomposition like eq .  ( [ s2e7 ] ) , and allows single transverse - spin asymmetries for final - state photons as well as hadrons @xcite .",
    "experimentally , data from fermilab show large single transverse - spin asymmetries in single pion production @xcite , and at the same time , show no apparent single transverse - spin asymmetries in prompt photon production in the central ( low @xmath0 ) region @xcite .",
    "experiments at fermilab for pion ( @xmath58 ) and prompt photon production were carried out with a 200 gev polarized proton ( or antiproton ) beam on an unpolarized proton target .",
    "the observed single transverse - spin asymmetries of inclusive single pion production can be as large as 20 to 30% in the forward region .",
    "in addition to the large values of the asymmetries , a number of other interesting features are evident in the data .",
    "for example , a strong rise of the asymmetries with @xmath0 was observed for all pion charges . when the beam was switched from polarized proton to polarized antiproton ,",
    "the same sign of the asymmetry was observed for @xmath6 , while the sign of the asymmetry for @xmath3 , as well as @xmath4 , changed .",
    "both beams had opposite signs of the asymmetries of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "perturbative qcd was first used to study the effects of single transverse - spin asymmetries by kane , pumplin , and repko ( kpr ) @xcite .",
    "kpr calculated the single transverse - spin asymmetry for single hadron ( pion ) production in terms of a qcd parton model . by calculating the quark - quark scattering diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , kpr found that the nonvanishing single transverse - spin asymmetry for large-@xmath2 reactions is proportional to the quark mass : @xmath59 , where , for example , @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the asymmetry vanishes in the scaling limit ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "although this calculation does not explain the observed large single transverse - spin asymmetries @xcite , the fact that the result is proportional to the quark mass indicates that the single transverse - spin asymmetry is a twist-3 effect in qcd perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "qcd dynamics , however , is much richer than the parton model .",
    "in addition to the parton mass effects just discussed , there are other twist-3 contributions . because quarks are not exactly parallel to the incoming hadron beam , twist-3 contributions also arise from `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum , which is proportional to @xmath62 are not independent , and",
    "can be combined to form @xmath63 , with @xmath64 $ ] , where @xmath65 is the covariant derivative .",
    "therefore , in addition to parton mass effects , single transverse - spin asymmetries can be proportional to the twist-3 matrix elements @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "these twist-3 matrix elements involve three field operators ( @xmath68 , or with the quark fields replaced by gluon field strengths @xcite ) .",
    "also , different choices for the dirac matrices @xmath69 in the operators give different twist-3 matrix elements ( see the appendix ) @xcite .    because of their odd numbers of field operators , three - field twist-3 matrix elements do not have the probability interpretation of parton distributions , which are proportional to matrix elements of twist-2 operators , @xmath70 or @xmath71 . in principle , however , they are as fundamental as the parton distributions . measurements of twist-3 distributions , or three - field correlation functions , provide us new opportunities to study qcd dynamics .",
