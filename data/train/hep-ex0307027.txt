    "in runi of the tevatron , cdf made essential contributions to @xmath0 physics , providing some of the best measurements of masses , lifetimes , mixing and branching ratios .",
    "the @xmath0 factories are now setting new standards with a wealth of precision measurements , posing stringent tests of the standard model .",
    "cdf has made significant improvements of the detector and the trigger to expand its capabilities beyond simply profiting from the higher luminosities of the tevatron in runii .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are amply produced at the tevatron : in runi the @xmath2 cross section with transverse momentum and rapidity was measured in the mode to be  @xcite .",
    "a new preliminary runii measurement of the charm meson cross sections for the same kinematic region yields even larger values : for @xmath3 and for @xmath4 , both measured using fully reconstructed hadronic decays .",
    "heavy flavor cross sections at hadron colliders are three orders of magnitude larger than at @xmath5 machines running at the @xmath6 , and include the heavier @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 baryons .",
    "the challenge at a hadron collider is to select in real time the heavy flavor events from the overwhelming qcd background .",
    "therefore the emphasis in this talk is on the trigger system , which is a particular strength of cdfii .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the tevatron has increased from 1.8tev in runi to 1.96tev in runii , and the number of proton and anti - proton bunches has increased from 6 to 36 , with a bunch separation of 396ns .",
    "we anticipate the number of interactions per bunch crossing to rise from 1.2 at present peak luminosities of to 6 at future luminosities of .",
    "this number can be reduced by increasing the number of bunches , but the upgrade to 132ns bunch spacing has been indefinitely postponed . at the time of this workshop , the tevatron has delivered 190pb@xmath11 , of",
    "which cdf has recorded 145pb@xmath11 on tape .",
    "present @xmath0 physics analyses use up to 70pb@xmath11 of this data , where part of the data was not used because the silicon detector was not fully operational .",
    "cdfii  @xcite has the typical structure of a 4@xmath12 detector at a symmetric collision point .",
    "a superconducting solenoid provides a uniform 1.4 t field over a tracking volume of 18m@xmath13 .",
    "closest to the beam is a silicon system to provide an accurate measurement of the impact parameter of charged tracks . a large - radius",
    ", low - material drift chamber gives accurate measurements of tens of charged particles per interaction .",
    "new in runii is a time - of - flight ( tof ) detector for particle identification at low momenta . outside the magnet",
    "are the calorimeters followed by muon identification systems .",
    "the components most relevant for @xmath0 physics are described in more detail below .",
    "cdfii has three silicon systems  @xcite .",
    "layer 00 ( l00 ) is a single - sided low - mass radiation - hard silicon detector , mounted on the beryllium beam pipe at a radius of 1.6 cm .",
    "the svxii is a five - layer double - sided silicon strip detector .",
    "it consists of 3 barrels , each 30 cm in length and covers 90% of the extended interaction region ( rms @xmath1430 cm ) . the intermediate silicon layer ( isl )",
    "provides one additional double - sided layer in the central region and two in the forward and backward regions , to improve track reconstruction .",
    "a light - weight carbon - fiber space frame keeps the 3.5m@xmath15 of isl sensors",
    "stably aligned at the 10@xmath16 m level .",
    "all silicon sensors use the same 128 channel svxiii readout chip that uses an analog pipeline for deadtimeless operation .",
    "the silicon system has @xmath14750k channels in total and can be readout in 20@xmath16s .      in the first year of data - taking for runii",
    ", cdf has faced many startup problems with the silicon system that have now mostly been overcome .",
    "the svxii has suffered from several beam incidents where a relatively small amount of radiation was incident on the silicon sensors and chips within a few nanoseconds , resulting in the loss of several sensors",
    ". the tevatron has now installed interlocks to prevent this class of beam incidents .",
    "other damage occurred when the silicon detector was read out at fixed frequencies of several khz during anomalous trigger conditions .",
    "this has been traced down to resonant oscillations of wirebonds perpendicular to the 1.4 t magnetic field .",
    "cdf has now implemented hardware protection against fixed - frequency readout .",
    "the isl suffered from insufficient cooling , as 11 of the 12 cooling lines were internally blocked with epoxy at some of the 90@xmath17 elbow connections . using boroscopes to find",
    "the blockages and a pulsed 40w laser to destroy them , 10 of the 11 blocked lines have now been cleared .",
    "l00 is affected by pickup from the digital readout lines on the analog signal cables .",
    "methods have been developed to correct for this in software , but they require non - sparsified readout , prohibiting the use of l00 in the trigger .",
    "the caen power supplies that supply the l00 sensors with the bias voltage suffered from beam related failures .",
    "this has been solved by replacing the mosfet voltage regulator by a bjt circuit . at the time of this workshop",
    "more than 90% of the silicon detector is operational and used in physics analyses .",
    "one disadvantage of the present silicon detector is the large amount of passive material inside the tracking region : a track traverses on average @xmath1415% of a radiation length .",
    "the central outer tracker  @xcite is a cylindrical ar / et drift chamber based on the highly successful ctc used in runi , modified to cope with the shorter time between interactions .",
    "the cot has 96 layers , organized in 8 super layers , alternating between axial and @xmath18 stereo readout .",
    "the single - wire resolution is approximately 200@xmath16 m , resulting in a momentum resolution of .",
    "the measurement of the specific energy deposition @xmath19 gives a @xmath20 separation of @xmath141.2@xmath21 in the region of the relativistic rise ( @xmath22gev ) .",
    "the cot has proven to be a very reliable detector , with fewer than 1% dead channels .",
    "the tracking efficiency for high-@xmath23 isolated tracks has been measured from data using events to be better than 99.5% .      for the first time at a hadron collider experiment ,",
    "cdfii has installed a time of flight ( tof ) detector for particle identification .",
    "it consists of 216 scintillator bars , 3 m long and @xmath24 cm in cross section , mounted between the cot and the superconducting solenoid .",
    "the bars are read out on both sides by compact fine - mesh 19-stage photomultipliers , that allow operation inside the full 1.4 t magnetic field .",
    "the achieved timing resolution is 120ps , close to the 100ps design , giving 2@xmath21 separation between pions and kaons up to momenta of 1.5gev/@xmath25 .",
    "the tof has been designed primarily to improve @xmath0 flavor tagging , in particular for the @xmath7 meson , which is often produced together with a kaon , correlated in charge to the @xmath26 quark produced .",
    "the tof has also found use for proton identification , cosmic ray rejection and monopole searches .",
    "the tof performs reliably and all 432 channels are fully functional .",
    "however , the occupancy of approximately 20% is about two times higher than expected , which has affected the reconstruction efficiency .",
    "cdf uses a three - level trigger system to reduce the 1.7mhz bunch crossing rate to 75hz written on tape .",
    "the first trigger level is deadtimeless , with a 42 buffer deep pipelined system , allowing 5.5@xmath16s to form a trigger decision .",
    "the extremely fast tracker ( xft )  @xcite reconstructs cot tracks in the axial projection down to transverse momenta of 1.5gev/@xmath25 , using hits with coarse timing information .",
    "muon and electron signals can also be matched to tracks .",
    "information about energy deposition in the hadron calorimeter are available at level1 , but are not used for @xmath0 triggers .",
    "the maximum input rate for level2 is presently about 20khz .",
    "we expect this to reach 25khz soon , but the original design rate of 50khz will be difficult to reach . at level2 , the silicon vertex tracker ( svt )  @xcite provides a list of tracks using axial hits of 4 silicon layers .",
    "this allows to select displaced tracks , which greatly enhances the purity of heavy flavor signals .",
    "typical rate reductions are o(10@xmath11 ) when requiring one track with a displacement of @xmath27100@xmath16 m , or o(10@xmath28 ) when requiring two displaced tracks .",
    "further trigger rate reductions are achieved when selecting on the opening angle between two tracks , requiring positive lifetime or pointing of the two - track momentum vector to the primary vertex .",
    "the readout time of the cot currently limits the rate into the third trigger level to less than 300hz . at level3 ,",
    "the complete events are processed on a farm of 300 pcs , which perform full event reconstruction and write up to 20mb / s to tape .",
    "the event size of almost 300 kb limits the level3 output rate to less than 75hz , but data compression techniques are being developed to increase this to more than 100hz .",
    "the vast majority of @xmath0 physics at cdf is based on three sets of triggers .",
    "dimuon _ trigger requires two muons with .",
    "it collects vast samples of decays , which come in about 15% of the cases from a @xmath0 decay . at present peak luminosities",
    "this trigger uses 40hz at level2 and new hardware is being built to select on the transverse mass of a muon pair , which should reduce this rate significantly .",
    "lepton+displaced track _ trigger uses muons and electrons with combined with a displaced track found by the svt .",
    "the specific yield of semileptonic @xmath0 decays with this trigger is 5 times higher than in the runi equivalent , which was based on an 8gev/@xmath25 lepton .",
    "these signals are used for lifetime measurements and for optimizing flavor tagging algorithms . the _ two - track _ trigger requires two displaced tracks .",
    "one version requires a large opening angle and the reconstructed @xmath0 should point back to the primary vertex .",
    "it is designed to collect 2-body @xmath0 decays , such as .",
    "the other requires smaller opening angles and has stricter requirements on the track displacement ( 120@xmath16 m instead of 100@xmath16 m ) .",
    "this second version is designed for multi - body @xmath0 decays , such as ; it has also proven useful for collecting huge samples of hadronic @xmath1 meson decays .",
    "the two - track trigger uses almost all of the available level1 bandwidth and a significant fraction of the bandwidth at level3 .",
    "we are constantly trying to reduce the trigger rates while keeping the maximum amount of real heavy flavor events .",
    "a typical `` store '' at the tevatron lasts about 20 hours , during which time the luminosity has decreased by a factor 2.5 with respect to the initial luminosity .",
    "since the trigger bandwidth has been designed for the peak luminosity , significant bandwidth is available in the later part of a store .",
    "we have developed techniques to fill this available bandwidth with @xmath0 physics by implementing triggers with several different @xmath23 thresholds and increasing the acceptance fraction ( prescale ) of the triggers with lower thresholds as the luminosity decreases .",
    "the two - track trigger comes in three versions .",
    "_ trigger has a low rate due to high thresholds ( two oppositely charged tracks of with ) and is never prescaled .",
    "the rate is low enough that it can be safely run up to luminosities of .",
    "nominal _ trigger requires two oppositely charged tracks of with .",
    "this trigger is prescaled when the level1 rate exceeds 20khz .",
    "low-@xmath23 _ trigger that requires two tracks of and no @xmath29 or opposite charge requirement is enabled when the level1 rate drops below 16khz . in the six months",
    "that dynamic prescaling has been enabled , the low-@xmath23 trigger has given a yield increase of 28% in the channel , as shown in figure  [ fig : dps ] , while it was prescaled on average by a factor 4.5 .",
    "to      until october 2002 , the xft required 10 out of 12 hits on the four axial superlayers of the cot to reconstruct a track .",
    "this resulted in an efficiency of @xmath3095% , but with a purity that was considered insufficient .",
    "studies showed that the cot single hit efficiency was high enough that requiring 11 out of 12 hits resulted in an efficiency still better than 90% , while reducing the rate of the two - track trigger by almost a factor two at high luminosity .",
    "the silicon vertex tracker requires the presence of four strip clusters in four layers , resulting in an overall efficiency that scales as the fourth power of the single hit efficiency .",
    "it is possible to program the svt to use all five svx layers , and allow a missing hit in one layer . in a test - run",
    ", we found a 15% increase of the svt single - track efficiency , as shown in figure  [ fig : effsvt_time ] .",
    "additional gain comes from the efficiency improvement for tracks that cross between svx half - barrels .",
    "we find an increase of the heavy flavor yield in the two - track trigger of more than 50% .",
    "however , the trigger rate at level2 rises by almost 100% and we are studying how to improve the purity .    to      while the core of the impact parameter resolution of the svt is similar to the offline resolution ( both @xmath1450@xmath16 m , including a contribution of @xmath1430@xmath16 m from the beamspot ) , the svt impact parameter measurement has significant non - gaussian tails , which can be attributed to the handling of large clusters of overlapping hits in the silicon detector .",
    "the reconstruction software at level3 can reduce the non - gaussian resolution tails because more time and more information are available for complex pattern recognition and the handling of overlapping hits . in may 2003 , silicon tracking at level3",
    "was implemented and resulted in a factor 2 reduction of the rate written to tape of the two - track trigger with a small ( @xmath145% ) loss of heavy flavor signal .",
    "the low @xmath23 threshold of the dimuon trigger has made it possible to collect @xmath31 decays down to zero transverse momentum .",
    "we measured a cross section @xmath32 = . using fully reconstructed decays we measure : , , and .",
    "in the two - track trigger , we have reconstructed 450k decays .",
    "we looked for @xmath33 decays , found zero events on a background of 1.7 , and set a preliminary limit of at 90% cl .",
    "we also looked for direct cp violation in @xmath34-tagged and decays and find and .",
