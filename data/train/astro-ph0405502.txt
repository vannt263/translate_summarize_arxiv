    "the recent discovery of extrasolar planets ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) has ignited renewed interest in models of giant planet formation . in the conventional model , core accretion ( lissauer 1993 ) , it is difficult to grow planets of several jupiter masses in less than a few million years , the typical disk lifetime estimated from observations ( haisch , lada & lada 2001 ) .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the fast inward migration rates produced by the disk - planet interaction as well as by the low accretion rates ensuing once a planet is big enough to open a gap ( nelson et al .",
    "2001 ; bate et al . 2003 ; nelson & benz 2003 ) .",
    "consequently , the disk instability model , in which giant planets arise in only a few disk orbital times ( less than a thousand years ) from the fragmentation of a massive , gravitationally unstable disk ( boss 1997 ; 2002 ; pickett 2000;2003 ) has gained new attention ( mayer et al . 2002 ; rice et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .",
    "the majority of solar - type stars in the galaxy belong to double or multiple stellar systems ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; eggenberger et al . 2004 ) .",
    "binaries can be formed by the fragmentation of a single bar - unstable molecular cloud core into two distinct objects ( boss 1986 ; burkert , bate & bodenheimer 1997 ) , from the collision of two dense cores in a giant molecular cloud ( whitworth et al .",
    "1995 ) or owing to the capture of neighboring stars in dense star forming regions ( bate et al . 2002 ) .",
    "fragmentation is usually considered as the main channel of binary formation and can take place in any type of environment ( horton , bate & bonnell 2001 ) . in such scenario two",
    "star - disk systems should form if the initial separation is larger than @xmath3 au , while at smaller separations a circumbinary disk can arise ( bate 2000 ) .",
    "radial velocity surveys have shown that planets exist in some binary or multiple stellar systems where the stars have separations from 20 to several thousand au ( eggenberger et al .",
    "although the samples are still small ( 20 out of the 120 known extrasolar planets are in binary systems ) , attempts have been made to compare properties of planets in single and multiple stellar systems ( patience et al .",
    "2003 ; udry et al .",
    "the first adaptive optics surveys designed to quantify the relative frequency of planets in single and multiple systems are just starting ( udry et al .",
    "these surveys could offer a new way to test theories of giant planet formation provided that different models yield different predictions as for the effect of a stellar companion .",
    "so far , two works have studied giant planet formation in binary systems . both focused on the disk instability model and reached opposite conclusions .",
    "nelson ( 2000 ) performed 2d sph simulations of protoplanetary disks that did not form protoplanets in isolation due to quite long cooling times ( johnson & gammie 2003 ) and found fragmentation to be even more unlikely in the presence of another disk with identical mass at a mean separation less than 100 au .",
    "in fact the disks were achieving a high stability owing to heating by shocks occurring along the spiral arms . boss ( 1998 , 2003 )",
    "performed 3d grid calculations of a disk interacting with a stellar companion also closer than 100 au and found that giant planet formation by disk instability can be enhanced by the tidal perturbation .    in this letter",
    "we revisit giant plant formation in a binary system using high resolution 3d sph simulations . in mayer",
    "et al . ( 2002 ; 2004 ) , we have shown that a high resolution is crucial in order to decide whether a massive protoplanetary disk will fragment into long - lasting clumps as a result of gravitational instability .",
    "fragmentation requires the disk to cool on a timescale comparable to or shorter than the disk orbital time ( rice et al .",
    "2003a , b ; mayer et al .",
    "2003 ) . here",
    "we consider binary systems of protoplanetary disks which mostly fragment in isolation ( mayer et al . 2003 ) and investigate whether the tides raised by the companion enhance or suppress fragmentation .",
    "the initial conditions comprise two protoplanetary disks , usually of equal mass , orbiting around each other .",
    "each disk orbits a central star as well . in a binary system arising from the fragmentation of a molecular cloud core one",
    "expects the two disks to form in the same plane and be rotating in the same direction relative to their orbital motion ( e.g. bate 2000).in this paper we will restrict our investigation to such coplanar prograde configurations ( see also nelson 2000 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the most important parameters of the simulations .",
    "the disks extend from 4 to 20 au and their orbital separation is in the range 60 - 120 au ( semi - major axis @xmath4 or @xmath5 au , eccentricity @xmath6 ) , corresponding to some of the smallest separations among binary systems with detected giant planets in radial velocity surveys ( eggenberger et al .",
    "each disk is represented by 200000 sph particles with equal mass and fixed gravitational softening of @xmath7 au , while the central star has a softening of 2 au ( see mayer et al . , 2004 , hereafter ma04 ) .",
    "the initial temperature reaches about @xmath8 k at the inner boundary and levels off at @xmath9 k close to 10 au .",
    "the details of the temperature and surface density profiles of the disks can be found in ma04 .",
    "= 9truecm    disk models are in equilibrium when evolved for several orbital times in absence of self - gravity ( see ma04 for details ) .",
    "models as light as the minimum mass solar nebula ( @xmath10 ) and as massive as the heaviest among t tauri disks ( dalessio et al .",
    "2001 ) are considered .",
    "the shape of the profile of the toomre q parameter is the same in all disks , while its normalization varies according to the mass of the disk .",
    "we recall that a gaseous ( nearly ) keplerian disk is stable against local axisymmetric perturbations if @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the angular frequency , @xmath14 is the sound speed , @xmath15 is the gravitational constant and @xmath16 is the surface density of the disk .",
    "the initial minimum q parameter ( reached near the disk edge ) is @xmath17 or higher ( see table 1 ) , hence close or above the threshold for fragmentation in isolation ( ma04 ; johnson & gammie 2003 ) .",
    "the radiative cooling time is taken to be proportional to the local orbital time , following rice et al .",
    "( 2003a ) .",
    "inside 5 au cooling is switched off in order to maintain temperatures high enough to be comparable to those in protosolar nebula models ( e.g. boss 1998 ) .",
    "cooling is also switched off in regions reaching a density above @xmath18 g/@xmath19 to account for the local high opacity ; the choice of the density threshold is motivated by the simulations of boss ( 2002 ) with radiative transfer in which the temperature of the gas is observed to evolve nearly adiabatically above such densities .",
    "we consider cooling times going from @xmath20 to @xmath21 the local orbital time .",
    "the jury is still out on whether the cooling times adopted here are credible or excessively short , but recent calculations by boss ( 2002 ) and johnson & gammie ( 2003 ) , which use different approximate treatments of radiative transfer , do find cooling times of this magnitude through a combination of radiative losses and convection ( but see mejia et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) . in any case",
    ", here we are interested in comparing the outcomes of isolated and binary systems for the same choice of the cooling time , in particular when cooling is strong enough to lead to fragmentation in isolated disks .",
    "heating by compressions and shocks is included in the simulations .",
    "we usually adopt @xmath22 , appropriate for molecular hydrogen , with a few simulations having @xmath23 .",
    "shocks are modeled using the standard monaghan viscosity with @xmath24 and @xmath25 plus the balsara correction term that removes unwanted shear viscosity ( see wadsley , stadel & quinn 2003 ) . the full analysis of the runs with isolated disks is carried out elsewhere ( mayer et al .",
    "2003 ; mayer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "here we only report on whether the isolated disks formed clumps or not ( see table 1 ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t : simul ]",
    "we begin by describing the outcome of the runs with the smallest orbital separations , corresponding to @xmath4 au ( see table 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the disks in one of such simulations .",
    "disk models are typically followed for two orbits .",
    "a binary orbit corresponds to about 288 years , or , equivalently , 10 disk orbital times at 10 au from the disk center .",
    "two calculations were extended further for two more orbits , but , since gravitational instability acts on the disk orbital timescale , fragmentation should occur during the first binary orbit .",
    "disks start at apocenter and develop a strong two - armed spiral pattern after crossing pericenter .",
    "the strong non - axisymmetric torques redistribute mass and angular momentum in the disks , which soon develops higher order spiral modes at distances between 12 and 15 au from their centers . in models that do not fragment ( see table 1 ) transient , moderately strong high order spiral",
    "arms continue to develop at subsequent pericentric passages , but @xmath26 always remains above the threshold for stability ( see figure 2 ) . in models that fragment , @xmath26 drops below 1 ( see figure 2 ) , and clumps appear on the disk side which is further from the other disk , along a strong unwinding trailing spiral arm . on the other side of the disk",
    "the developing overdensities are destroyed as tides tear them apart .",
    "we can identify three regimes as for the disk response to the tidal perturbation .",
    "such regimes can be distinguished based on the disk mass .",
    "very light disks , which are completely stable in isolation , develop a clear two - armed spiral pattern but their self - gravity is too low to amplify the waves and sustain the instability ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this spiral mode simply evolves periodically with the orbit , strengthening at pericenter and weakening at apocenter .",
    "disks at the high mass end , which are strongly self - gravitating , and , when isolated , undergo fragmentation into protoplanets for cooling times of order the orbital time ( mayer et al . 2003 ) , develop a very strong and complex spiral pattern after the first pericenter passage , with a dominant two - armed mode ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "however , such strong amplification of the spiral waves also leads to intense compressional heating along the arms .",
    "these spiral shocks increase the temperature of the outer disk by nearly a factor of 3 and bring the system towards stability ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this is why the spiral arms fade away considerably during the second orbit ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the suppression of fragmentation by tidally induced shock heating was also advocated by nelson ( 2000 ) . in the intermediate mass regime ,",
    "@xmath27 , self - gravity is non - negligible and spiral instabilities are visibly amplified , but shock heating is mild enough for non - axisymmetric features to last longer and build up more pronounced overdensities ( figure 3 ) .",
    "these disks can fragment for the shortest among the cooling times considered here despite the fact that they can avoid fragmentation in isolation .",
    "such short cooling times are probably unrealistic , nevertheless it is interesting that there are cases in which tides can increase the susceptibility to fragmentation as found by boss ( 1998 ) .",
    "= 6truecm = 6truecm    we can ask how realistic are the temperatures seen in our simulations .",
    "the high temperatures developing in the outer parts of the most massive disk models are comparable to those in the simulations of nelson ( 2000 ) .",
    "this author calculated the corresponding radiation flux at far - infrared and radio wavelengths ( from 870 @xmath28 m to 1.3 cm ) assuming that the disk emits like a blackbody and obtained fluxes somewhat lower than observed in a prototype young binary protostellar disk system , l1551 irs 5 ( bachiller , tafalla & cernicharo 1994 ) .",
    "therefore the temperatures seen in our simulations are probably a conservative estimate of those occurring in real binary systems .",
    "temperature in excesse of 200 k as those obtained here ( figure 3 ) for the most massive disk models ( especially along the spiral shocks ) would be enough to vaporize water ice .",
    "the latter should contribute almost half of the mass of solid material in a protoplanetary disk ( pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) , and is therefore a fundamental building block of large solid grains and , ultimately , of planetesimals .",
    "a reduced growth of rocky planetary embryos could result , and therefore giant planet formation by core accretion could also be less likely in such binary systems relative to isolated system ( see also nelson 2000 ) .",
    "light or intermediate mass disks , instead , maintain outer disk temperatures lower than 100 k between 10 and 20 au ( figure 2 ) posing no problem for core accretion .",
    "many binary systems comprise stars with unequal masses .",
    "we simulated the interaction between two disk+star systems with masses differing by a factor of 2 ( run rbm2 , see figure 3 ) .",
    "the most massive of the two disks ( @xmath29 ) , which never fragmented when interacting with an equally massive disk ( e.g. run rb1a , rb1b , rb1c ) , now manages to produce two clumps of roughly one jupiter mass .",
    "yet these clumps are quickly dissolved as the pressure still overcomes self - gravity .",
    "the lighter disk forms strong multi - armed spirals , probably resulting from strong swing amplification ( as expected given the lower mass of the central star , see ma04 ) .",
    "although the temperature remains quite low ( @xmath30 drops close to unity locally ) , nascent overdensities are apparently sheared away before they are able to fragment because of the strong tidal field of the more massive companion .",
    "we note that a @xmath29 disk does not produce permanent clumps both while interacting with an identical disk ( e.g. run rb1a ) and when orbiting a companion system half of its mass as in run rbm2 .",
    "coversely , in run rb3b a disk only 20% lighter ( see table 1 ) does give rise to long - lived clumps while interacting with a system of identical mass ( all these runs employ the same cooling times ) .",
    "this suggests that tidally induced spiral shocks become too strong above some critical value of the disk self - gravity , and heating becomes dominant , despite the fact that the strength of the external perturbation changes significantly .    among",
    "the few known binary systems with planets the majority have stars with a projected separation above 100 au . in runs",
    "rbw(a , b , c ) we evolved the massive disk models on orbits with a larger semi - major axis , @xmath31 au . in all these runs",
    "we wintnessed fragmentation ( figure 3 ) , although in run rbwc , in which the cooling time was the longest , clumps did not survive for more than @xmath32 disk orbital times .",
    "we conclude that at these larger orbital separations disk instability proceeds similarly to the case of isolated disks because tidal forces are considerably weaker .",
    "moreover , the temperatures at such separations are low enough to guarantee the survival of ice grains ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we have shown that fragmentation by disk instability is suppressed in binary systems with orbital separations around 60 au .",
    "this happens because shock heating overwhelms cooling and damps any overdensity .",
    "shock heating is stronger than in isolated disks because the tidally forced spiral arms reach a much greater amplitude relative to spiral arms in isolated disks .",
    "this is especially true in the most massive disks since their higher self - gravity amplifies the spiral arms more efficiently .",
    "the role of shock heating in disk instability has been already recognized as crucial for understanding if giant planets can form by disk instability ( pickett et al . 2000 , 2003 ) . in systems with a separation of 120 au , disk temperatures remain quite low and fragmentation proceeds more similarly to the isolated disks .",
    "the high temperatures ( @xmath33 k ) developing in massive binary disk systems with separations less than @xmath34 au make it hard to form giant planets even by disk core accretion .",
    "intermediate mass systems are those in which both mechanisms are possible if cooling is very efficient whereas in binary disks with small masses , comparable to that of the minimum mass solar nebula model , core - accretion is the only viable mechanism . models of the core accretion mechanism used to require a disk 3 - 4 times more massive than the minimum solar nebula in order to form jupiter in less than 10 million years ( lissauer 1993 ) .",
    "however , more recent models that account for orbital migration of rocky cores find formation timescales of a few million years even in a minimum mass solar nebula since the cores feed more efficiently with planetesimals as they migrate in the disk ( rice & armitage 2003 ; alibert , mordasini & benz 2004 ) .",
    "if core accretion can take place in light disks then giant planets could form regardless of the presence or distance of a companion .",
    "this suggests that binarity can be used to probe planet formation models . if the new surveys aimed at quantifying the relative number of giant planets in single and binary systems will find no trend with binary separation disk instability can not be the main formation mechanism .",
    "the opposite might be true if such trend emerges .",
    "our analysis was restricted to just one type of orbital configuration .",
    "because of the low orbital eccentricity , the external perturbation is nearly continous in amplitude .",
    "this could favour high temperatures through nearly continous compressional heating .",
    "although nelson ( 2000 ) did not find any remarkable difference in systems with orbital eccentricities varying by a factor of 3 , impulsive tidal perturbations , caused for example by a close fly by of a star or brown dwarf , which would be common in highly dynamical star formation scenarios ( e.g. bate et al . 2002 ) , could produce a different outcome .",
    "a strong shock would occur in this case but over time compressional heating would be much lower .",
    "we will invesigate such situations in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we will also consider a larger variety of initial orbital configurations , for example non - coplanar disks possibly resulting from a capture event .",
    "the study of the geometry and relative orbits of debris disks around young binaries will be needed to find out to what extent the simple orbital configurations used in this paper are really representative .",
    "we thank stephane udry , anne eggenberger and michel mayor for stimulating discussions .",
