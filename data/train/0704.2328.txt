    "the celebrated smale horseshoe can be rightly considered as a prototypical example in the study of complex systems .",
    "it deals with a homeomorphism @xmath1 defined on a set diffeomorphic to a rectangle in a two@xmath0dimensional manifold , possessing an invariant set @xmath2 such that @xmath3 is conjugate to the two@xmath0sided bernoulli shift on two symbols .",
    "such striking model exploits a simple and elegant geometric description in order to display the main features associated to all the various different definitions of chaos . since the beginning @xcite , its clear and intuitive geometrical structure turned out to be very useful in the study of dynamical systems , allowing a rigorous proof of the presence of a complex behavior in several significant ode models ( * ? ? ?",
    "one of the crucial assumptions regarding the implementation of this method concerns the verification of hyperbolicity .",
    "usually , this concept is meant as the existence of a splitting of the domain into a part along which @xmath4 is contracting and another one where @xmath4 is expanding , the two parts being filled by graphs of lipschitzean functions ( see @xcite ) . however , in certain applications to differential systems , the verification of hyperbolicity requires the smoothness of the involved maps and conditions on their jacobian matrix which lead sometimes to formidable and difficult computations ( see @xcite ) . this remark or similar ones carried various authors to look for a class of relaxed assumptions in view of producing a structure as rich as before , but possibly replacing the hyperbolicity hypothesis with topological conditions which , in some cases , require the knowledge of the behavior of @xmath4 only on some subsets of its domain ( for instance , at the boundary of certain sets ) .",
    "results in this direction were obtained by easton @xcite , burns and weiss @xcite , mischaikow and mrozek @xcite , szymczak @xcite , zgliczyski @xcite , srzednicki and wjcik @xcite and further developed in subsequent works ( see , for instance , @xcite and the references therein , just to quote a few samples from a broad bibliography ) . in these papers usually the authors prove the existence of a compact set @xmath2 which is ( forward ) invariant ( either for a given map @xmath4 or for an iterate of it ) and the existence of a continuous surjection @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) which provides a semiconjugation of @xmath3 with the two@xmath0sided ( respectively one@xmath0sided ) bernoulli shift . in many cases",
    "the authors also show that the inverse image through @xmath7 of a periodic sequence of @xmath8 symbols contains a periodic point of @xmath4 in @xmath9 the tools employed in the related proofs are based on different topological methods , like the conley index theory ( with associated homological or cohomological invariants ) or some more or less sophisticated fixed point methods ( as the topological degree , the fixed point index or the lefschetz theory ) which usually require the verification of suitable conditions ( for a flow or for a map ) at the boundary of a certain domain containing the invariant set in its interior .",
    "a different generalization of the smale s horseshoe has been obtained in recent years by kennedy and yorke @xcite and kennedy , koak and yorke @xcite , who developed the theory of the so - called _ topological horseshoes _ in the frame of metric spaces .",
    "this theory concerns the study of the behavior of a continuous map @xmath10 and of its iterates , where @xmath11 is a compact subset of a metric space @xmath12 two disjoint compact subsets @xmath13 and @xmath14 of @xmath11 are selected and the crossing number @xmath8 is defined as the largest number of disjoint preconnections contained in any connection .",
    "a connection @xmath15 is a compact connected set ( a continuum ) with @xmath16 and @xmath17 while a preconnection @xmath18 is a compact set such that @xmath19 is a connection . under a few more technical conditions ( see @xcite for the precise statements ) and if @xmath20 the authors prove the existence of a compact invariant set @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is semiconjugate ( via a surjective map @xmath7 ) to a bernoulli shift on @xmath8 symbols .",
    "applications of such results to different ode models have been shown in @xcite and in recent related papers .",
    "the great generality of the setting in @xcite does not lead to the conclusion that the inverse image ( through the surjection @xmath7 ) of a periodic sequence in @xmath23 must necessarily contain a periodic point in @xmath24 in fact , a specific example of an invariant set @xmath25 without periodic points is presented in @xcite .    another approach has been proposed by papini and the second author in @xcite , motivated by the study of the poincar map associated to a second order nonlinear differential equation with sign changing weight @xcite . in @xcite and some subsequent more general works @xcite , the authors considered continuous planar maps which possess the property of stretching the paths joining two opposite sides of a topological rectangle . in this case",
    "the paths play a role analogous to that of the connections in kennedy and yorke theory .",
    "such a special configuration permits to obtain not only chaotic dynamics , but also the existence of fixed points and periodic points ( by means of elementary topological arguments ) . in this manner",
    "one could complement some results in the two@xmath0dimensional setting ( like those in @xcite ) and provide the existence of infinitely many periodic points ( of any order ) as well .",
    "other applications of the results in @xcite can be found in @xcite , dealing with second order odes .",
    "see also for more information , although we have to warn that a precise relationship between these works and the theory of topological horseshoes as presented in @xcite was not explicitly stated therein .",
    "on the contrary , such relationship will be described in the present work ( see lemma [ lem-3c.1 ] ) , including some details elsewhere missing .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "in fact we provide an elementary topological tool that , on the one hand , allows us to extend to the higher dimension the theory of @xcite and to make a comparison with the above recalled results on chaotic@xmath0like dynamics , while , on the other hand , enables to generalize and unify some previous theorems about the existence of fixed points and periodic points for continuous maps in euclidean spaces .",
    "in particular , we give a simplified proof of a recent result by kampen @xcite as well as we present a generalization of some preceding theorems about periodic points associated to markov partitions @xcite .",
    "as remarked above , one of the purposes of our work is also that of obtaining a sufficiently rich structure ( suitable , for instance , to guarantee the existence of infinitely many periodic points ) , without the need of too sophisticated methods .",
    "in fact , our main tools are , respectively , a modified version of the classical hurewicz@xmath0wallman intersection lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* d ) , p.40 ) , @xcite and the fundamental theorem of leray@xmath0schauder ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thorme fondamental ) . the former result ( also referred to eilenberg@xmath0otto ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.3 ) , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem on partitions , p.100 ) ) is one of the basic lemmas in dimension theory and it is known to be one of the equivalent versions of the brouwer fixed point theorem .",
    "it may be interesting to observe that extensions of the intersection lemma led to generalizations of the brouwer fixed point theorem to some classes of possibly noncontinuous functions @xcite .",
    "the other result we use concerns topological degree theory and has found important applications in nonlinear analysis and differential equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "actually , in theorem [ th-3b.1 ] of section [ sec-3b ] , we ll employ a more general version of the leray@xmath0schauder continuation theorem due to fitzpatrick , massab and pejsachowicz @xcite .",
    "however , we point out that for our applications to the study of periodic points and chaotic@xmath0like dynamics we rely on the classical leray@xmath0schauder fundamental theorem . another particular feature of our approach consists in a combination of the poincar@xmath0miranda theorem @xcite with the properties of topological surfaces cutting the arcs between two given sets .",
    "the corresponding details are widely described in section [ sec-2 ] and section [ sec-3a ] . in regard to the poincar@xmath0miranda theorem , which is an @xmath26dimensional version of the intermediate value theorem ( see theorem [ th-2b.1 ] ) , we would like to recall also the recent work , where the authors show its effectiveness in detecting chaotic dynamics in planar dynamical systems .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec-2 ] is devoted to the presentation of some topological lemmas concerning the relationship between cutting surfaces and zero sets of continuous real valued functions .",
    "analogous results can be found , often in a more implicit form , in different contexts . since for our applications",
    "we need a specific version of the statements , we give an independent proof with all the details .",
    "the remainder of the paper is divided in three parts . in section [ sec-3a ]",
    "we present a variant of hurewicz@xmath0wallman theorem ( theorem [ th-2b.2 ] ) , that ( likewise @xcite ) guarantees a nonempty intersection among @xmath27 closed topological surfaces which are in good position with respect to the faces of an @xmath26dimensional hypercube .",
    "such result is then applied in order to provide an extension of some recent theorems about fixed points and periodic points for continuous mappings in euclidean spaces . in particular , we generalize ( with a simplified proof ) a theorem by kampen @xcite ( see corollary [ cor-2b.1 ] ) and obtain also an extension of a result by zgliczyski @xcite ( see theorem [ th-2b.z ] ) . in section [ sec-3b ]",
    "we consider the case in which , roughly speaking , the number of intersecting surfaces is smaller than the dimension of the space . after presenting a general situation in theorem [ th-3b.2a ] ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of the intersection of @xmath28 continua embedded in a topological space homeomorphic to the @xmath26dimensional hypercube ( see corollary [ cor-3b.1 ] ) .",
    "this latter result turns out to be our main ingredient in section [ sec-3c ] for the study of the dynamics of continuous maps which possess , in a very broad sense , a one@xmath0dimensional expansive direction .",
    "indeed , it allows to prove a fixed point theorem ( see theorem [ th-3c.1 ] ) for maps defined on topological rectangles .",
    "the main hypothesis for our fixed point theorem requires that the map @xmath4 stretches ( across @xmath29 ) the paths joining two disjoint subsets @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the boundary of the topological rectangle @xmath12 formally , such stretching condition is expressed as follows : there exists a compact set @xmath32 on which @xmath4 is continuous and such that , for any path @xmath33 connecting in @xmath29 the two sides @xmath30 and @xmath34 there exists a sub - path @xmath35 of @xmath33 contained in @xmath36 whose image through @xmath4 is contained in @xmath29 and joins the same two sides of the boundary ( as shown in figure 1 ) .",
    "a special feature of our theorem is that it ensures the existence of a fixed point for @xmath4 in @xmath36 that , in turns , yields to the existence of multiple fixed points when the stretching condition is satisfied with respect to a certain number of pairwise disjoint subsets @xmath37 s of @xmath12 an application of the theorem to the iterates of @xmath4 will then allow to obtain a set of infinitely many periodic points with a complex structure .",
    "more generally , we define , for a mapping @xmath1 a concept of stretching between two ( possibly different ) oriented @xmath27-dimensional rectangles @xmath38 and @xmath39 where the @xmath40 ^ -$]-sets are the union of two suitably chosen left and right sides of the boundary ( see definition [ def-3c.1 ] and figure 1 ) .        in this manner we fully extend to an arbitrary dimension the above recalled results by papini and zanolin @xcite . as a consequence , also all the applications to ordinary differential equations and dynamical systems contained in those articles and in related ones ( like @xcite ) are , in principle , extendable to the higher dimension .",
    "the specific applications , which would require a detailed treatment , will be presented in a future work .",
    "we end this introductory section with a list of basic definitions and notation .",
    "some further concepts will be introduced later on in the paper when needed . + as usual we denote by @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath430,+\\infty)\\,$ ] the sets of reals , as well as the nonnegative and positive real numbers , respectively .",
    "the sets of integers @xmath44 and natural numbers @xmath45 are considered as well . for a subset @xmath46 of a topological space @xmath47 we denote by @xmath48 and @xmath49 the interior and the closure of @xmath50 respectively . for a metric space @xmath51 we indicate with @xmath52 the open ball of center @xmath53 and radius @xmath54 similarly , given @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , we define @xmath57 by a continuum we mean a compact and connected subset of a metric space ( i.e. a metric continuum ) .",

    "then , if @xmath58 is a metric space , the above definition of arcwise connectedness is equivalent to the fact that , given any two points @xmath99 with @xmath100 there exists an _ arc _ ( that is the homeomorphic image of a compact interval ) contained in @xmath58 and having @xmath101 and @xmath102 as extreme points ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , in this section we present some topological lemmas in order to show the relationship between particular surfaces and zero sets of continuous real valued functions .",
