    "in order to employ the degree of freedom of the spin in future information technology , materials with low gilbert damping and long spin - wave propagation distances are needed for data transport .",
    "yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) is a material which fulfills the aforesaid requirements .",
    "new technologies employing yig are being developed and new physical phenomena were investigated .",
    "logic operations with spin waves in yig waveguides @xcite , data - buffering elements @xcite and magnon transistors @xcite are only a few examples for the latest technology progress . especially , yig films of nanometer thickness @xcite are of large importance since they allow for the realization of nano- and microstructures @xcite and an enhancement of spin - transfer - torque related effects @xcite . in this context",
    "the material parameters of yig are of crucial importance for its application potential .    in a magnetic system",
    ", the exchange interaction contributes strongly to the energy of the system . from a classical point of view , this interaction is responsible for the parallel alignment of adjacent spins , thus , it strongly influences the spin - wave characteristics .",
    "the strength of the exchange interaction is given by the exchange stiffness @xmath0 , but the existing approaches for its measurement are often influenced by internal magnetic fields depending consequently on crystal anisotropies and the saturation magnetization .",
    "thus , methods are required for the exact determination of the exchange stiffness without the uncertainties added by the aforementioned parameters . here ,",
    "such a method is presented and compared to the results obtained by commonly used data evaluation methods .",
    "firstly , the classical approach of schreiber and frait @xcite is used for the determination of the exchange stiffness when the external static magnetic field is applied out - of - plane .",
    "secondly , the method is modified to avoid any influence of the anisotropy fields and the saturation magnetization in order to achieve highly - precise values for @xmath0 .",
    "thirdly , the method of schreiber and frait is adapted and used for in - plane measurements .",
    "all values of @xmath0 obtained by using the different methods are compared and , then , values of the exchange constant @xmath1 are calculated for our yig samples .",
    "the precessional motion of the magnetization in an effective magnetic field is described by the landau - lifshitz and gilbert equation @xcite .",
    "the effective magnetic field depends on various parameters , such as the applied static and time dependent magnetic fields ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) , anisotropy fields ( the cubic anisotropy field @xmath10 , the uniaxial out - of - plane @xmath11 and in - plane @xmath12 anisotropy fields ) , as well as the exchange field @xmath13 which describes the exchange interaction in the investigated material . here",

    "@xcite the films exhibit a room temperature lattice misfit @xmath38 which results in strained epitaxial films .",
    "this strain is one of the main factors defining the uniaxial anisotropy fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the case of lpe growth of garnet films incorporation of lead ions from the pbo solvent plays an important role in adjusting the film misfit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the misfit essentially depends on growth parameters ( growth temperature , growth rate , etc . ) . for this reason ,",

    "then , the samples were cut in sizes of @xmath45mm@xmath5 for microwave studies .    for measuring the exchange stiffness ,",
    "a waveguide microwave resonance setup was used .",
    "an electromagnet is used to apply external fields up to @xmath46mt@xmath47mt , where a low - amplitude ( @xmath48mt ) rf - frequency ( @xmath49mhz ) modulation field is used by a lock - in amplifier as reference signal .",

    "can be found at the highest field values , whereas the thickness modes are located at lower field values . in any case",
    "mainly resonances with an even mode number are observed .",
    "this effect can be understood with the assumption of `` perfect pinning '' , since in this case , only the even modes absorb energy from the homogeneous antenna field @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of odd pssws can be caused by small microwave inhomogeneities across the film thickness .    in the classical approach of schreiber and",

    "the presence of resonances with odd mode numbers introduces some ambiguity regarding the identification of the modes .",
    "however , the mode intensity together with the @xmath54-dependence of the resonance field shift enables a consistent identification , as can be seen in fig  [ klingler : fig : spectrum](b ) . here , the resonance fields of sample e2 are shown for different frequencies .",
    "the slopes of the linear functions are the same for all measurements and the @xmath55-intercepts are different due to the use of different excitation frequencies . in the performed measurements no deviations from the linear functions",
    "were detected which would occur for small @xmath18 due influence of the surface anisotropy .",

    ", the slope and the effective magnetization are optimized together during the fitting process , i.e. the residuum is minimized .",

    ", a method which is completely independent on assumptions for the anisotropy fields and the saturation magnetization is presented .",
    "for this the ferromagnetic resonance field @xmath68 is subtracted from the resonance fields of the higher modes @xmath69 in order to determine the exchange field @xmath70 of the thickness modes . since the resonance field of the ferromagnetic resonance contains all information about the anisotropy fields and @xmath15 , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exchange2 ] ) , the exchange field only depends on @xmath0 : @xmath71 in fig .",
    "[ klingler : fig : highermodes - fmr ] the exchange fields are shown as a function of @xmath54 .",

    "furthermore , all collapsed data points lie on a linear function with @xmath72 .",
    "this data can now be analyzed using a simple linear fit with no offset , i.e. only one fitting parameter is used .",

    "the results are shown in the middle column of tab .",
    "[ klingler : tab : results ] .",
    "all values are in the same range as obtained with the former method .",
    "however , it is visible that the exchange stiffness of sample e1 is significantly smaller that the others .",
    "this difference can be understood by a larger saturation magnetization for sample e1 than for samples e2 and e3 as shown below . in comparison to the method of schreiber and frait ,",
    "the error is decreased by a factor of up to 9 due to the avoided influence of the effective magnetization during the data evaluation .",
    "this allows for the identification of the exchange stiffness with a high accuracy .",

    "[ klingler : fig : spectrum2](a ) .",
    "it is slightly modified in comparison to the out - of - plane spectrum .",
    "the resonances are shifted to smaller field values due to decreased demagnetizing effects . in the in - plane case , the former methods can not be used for data evaluation since @xmath24 is not linearly dependent on the static field in eq .",
    "( [ klingler : eq : kittel_ip ] ) .",
    "however , the former procedure can be applied to the pure exchange field of the pssws . for this",
    "we propose the following steps .",
    "firstly , eq .  ( [ klingler : eq : kittel_ip ] ) must be rewritten in a way which is convenient for the fitting process : @xmath73 here , the different field contributions , including the saturation magnetization , are summarized in @xmath74 .",
    "now the effective magnetization is obtained by fitting the @xmath19-mode ( fmr mode ) .",
    "secondly , the same equation is used to obtain the exchange field @xmath70 of the higher pssw modes ( @xmath75 ) . for this , the obtained value of @xmath76 is used as a constant during the data evaluation process .",
    "the resulting exchange fields @xmath70 of the pssw modes depend on the square of a mode number which is unknown at first . as in the case of the out - of - plane measurements",
    "there is an ambiguity regarding the identification of the mode number @xmath18 for each observed mode .",
    "the identification procedure of the mode numbers is shown next .",
    "thirdly , the exchange fields of the modes are varied manually over the presumed mode numbers ( see fig .",
    "[ klingler : fig : spectrum2](b ) ) . as first indicator",
    ", the peak height of the resonance can be used to determine whether a mode is an even mode or not . to proove the mode numbering a graphical feedback",
    "can be obtained by plotting @xmath77 over @xmath54 , where a wrong mode numbering would be directly visible . if the exchange field follows a linear function , as shown in fig .",
    "[ klingler : fig : spectrum2](b ) , the exchange stiffness is given by the slope of this function .",
    "for all three samples the values of the exchange stiffnesses are shown in the right column of tab .",
    "[ klingler : tab : results ] .",
    "they are in the same range with the other methods which supports the value of this method",

    "the presented result is in good agreement with the values obtained by other groups @xcite .",

    "the in - plane estimates of the exchange stiffness @xmath0 were found to agree well with those obtained in the out - of - plane configuration .",
