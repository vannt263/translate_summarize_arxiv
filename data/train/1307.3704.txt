    "the nature of the lowest scalar meson is unveiled .",
    "nowadays , @xmath3 meson was established with a low mass  @xcite , and @xmath6 meson is experimentally - confirmed , while @xmath2 meson is still disputable  @xcite . moreover , there are long - lasting debates on the traits of the lowest scalar meson : is it a conventional @xmath7 or tetraquarks @xmath8  @xcite",
    "?    the tetraquark interpretation can easily realize the experimental mass ordering @xmath9 by lattice qcd , whereas the conventional @xmath7 states hardly explain this mass ordering  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is consistent with the mit bag model  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is sharply criticized for overlooking some unresolved physical issues such as chiral symmetry breaking and non - trivial vacuum state  @xcite , etc .",
    "this question can be partially reconciled if the masses of @xmath10 states with @xmath11 and @xmath12 are robustly calculated on the lattice .",
    "we here call these states as @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 mesons , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 meson was studied in staggered fermion  @xcite .",
    "the propagators are discovered to hold the states with masses below the likely combinations of two physical mesons  @xcite , which can be nicely interpreted by the bubble contribution to the @xmath1 correlator ( for simplicity , we call it  @xmath1 bubble \" in this work , likewise for  @xmath2 bubble \" and  @xmath3 bubble \" ) derived by sasa in ma@xmath0pt  @xcite .",
    "we have been studying scalar meson for some time . with @xmath5 asqtad - improved staggered sea quarks  @xcite",
    ", we obtained @xmath2 mass : @xmath13  mev  @xcite , and rectified the taste - symmetry breaking by extending analyses of @xmath3 and @xmath1 mesons  @xcite to @xmath2 meson in the staggered chiral perturbation theory ( s@xmath0pt )  @xcite .",
    "we realized that @xmath2 bubble should be involved in a fit of @xmath2 correlator for the milc medium coarse ( @xmath14  fm ) and coarse ( @xmath15  fm ) lattice ensembles .",
    "moreover , bubble contributions to scalar correlators in s@xmath0pt offers a test of lattice artifacts due to the fourth - root trick  @xcite .",
    "additionally , s@xmath0pt predicts that these lattice artifacts vanish in the continuum limit , merely remaining physical thresholds  @xcite . to check this prediction , we specially studied scalar mesons at a milc fine ( @xmath16 fm ) lattice ensemble  @xcite . as expected , lattice artifacts are indeed significantly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "lattice studies with staggered fermions are cheaper than those of other fermion discretizations , which allow lattice studies with the smaller dynamical quark masses or finer lattice spacings .",
    "but , this benefits accompanies by an extra theoretical complications .",
    "each staggered quark exists in four tastes  @xcite , and staggered meson comes in sixteen tastes , and the taste symmetry breaking at @xmath17 gives rise to discretization errors of @xmath18  @xcite . since these errors are usually not negligible , these unphysical effects predicted by s@xmath0pt  @xcite should be neatly removed from the lattice data in order to extract the desired physical quantities .    theoretically , lattice study with domain - wall ( dw ) quarks is simpler than that with staggered quarks since they do not come in multiple species  @xcite",
    ". consequently , it makes ma@xmath0pt expressions for bubble contributions to scalar mesons simple and continuum - like  @xcite .",
    "moreover , they keep proper chiral symmetry up to exponentially small corrections at @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , realistic simulations with dw fermions are expensive .",
    "we notice that there exists a pioneering study on @xmath1 meson with dw fermions  @xcite .",
    "ma@xmath0pt for ginsparg - wilson type quarks on a staggered sea was proposed in ref .",
    "other quantities like @xmath1 bubble have since been added in ma@xmath0pt  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that only a couple of extra parameters enter the relevant chiral formulas .",
    "one of these parameters was determined by milc collaboration  @xcite .",
    "et al _ estimated another one inherent in the mixed - action case  @xcite .",
    "these parameters can be used to study other physical quantities : e.g. , the bubble contributions to scalar mesons discussed in this work .    in this work",
    "we extend sasa s original derivation on the bubble contribution to @xmath1 correlator  @xcite to those of @xmath2 and @xmath3 correlators in ma@xmath0pt with @xmath5 chiral valence quarks and @xmath5 staggered sea quarks , and exploit two above - mentioned published parameters  @xcite to elucidate our analytical expressions using two mass tuning .",
    "we found that @xmath2 and @xmath3 bubbles demonstrated many particular features , e.g. , the strong infrared - sensitive unphysical effects due to the multiplication of two double pole to @xmath3 bubble .",
