    "the formation of stars is accompanied by energetic activity such as jets and outflows .",
    "this can affect the structure and the chemical composition of the surrounding cloud , possibly influencing its continued star formation .",
    "a relevant question therefore is , to what the extent the emission of commonly used tracers of dense gas reflects the energetics of star formation rather than the underlying structure of the cloud .",
    "this is especially interesting for unresolved observations of clouds and cloud complexes , at large distances in our galaxy or in other galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this poster contribution investigates the emission lines of three molecules ( hco@xmath2 , hcn , and n@xmath3h@xmath2 ) in the serpens star - forming region , with the specific question in mind of the relation between the emission and activity of young stars .    the serpens star - forming region is ideally suited for the stated aim .",
    "it is relatively nearby at @xmath5 pc ( @xcite ) and harbors several deeply embedded protostars as well as apparently starless dust condensations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular cloud consists of two subcondensations , northeast ( ne ) and southwest ( sw ) , each of which are broken up into numerous subclumps and filaments .",
    "many outflows emanate from the serpens region ( @xcite ) , apparently driven by the embedded protostars .",
    "the high density of young stellar objects ( ysos ) and the complex structure of the region precludes identification of the driving sources of many of these flows .",
    "it is likely that the course of some of the flows are altered by collisions with dense cloud material , further confusing the picture .",
    "in this poster i present single - dish observations of the @xmath0=10 lines of hco@xmath2 , hcn , and n@xmath3h@xmath2 obtained with the kitt peak 12-meter ( kp12 m ) telescope ; aperture - synthesis observations are discussed in   [ s : bima ] .",
    "the kp12 m maps cover a @xmath6 area encompassing the ne and sw condensations ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the beam size of the telescope is @xmath7 .",
    "the n@xmath3h@xmath2 emission traces the ne and sw condensations equally , resembling the scuba 850 @xmath8 m emission that traces cold dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath2 emission is dominated by the se condensation , where most of the ysos are located and where most of the outflows originate .",
    "this indicates that n@xmath3h@xmath2 reliably reflects the distribution of the cloud material , while hco@xmath2 and hcn emission is enhanced near outflows .",
    "the velocity centroids of the emission lines show an east  west gradient of 2.5 km  s@xmath9 , most clearly seen in n@xmath3h@xmath2 , indicating solid - body rotation of the entire cloud , as reported by @xcite .",
    "to investigate if the close match between n@xmath3h@xmath2 and dust continuum , and the association of hcn and hco@xmath2 with outflows holds on smaller scales , aperture - synthesis images are shown in fig .",
    "these interferometer observations where obtained at the bima millimeter array , at resolutions of @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "mosaics of 13 array pointings cover a @xmath12 region around the se condensation ; the nw condensation has already been studied at high angular resolution by @xcite .",
    "there exists an almost one - to - one correspondence between the peaks in the n@xmath3h@xmath2 bima map and the 850 @xmath8 m emssion .",
    "the only excpetions are two n@xmath3h@xmath2 peaks , one north of smm  3 and one @xmath13 northeast of smm  4 .",
    "as discussed below , both locations probably are shocks .",
    "the association of hco@xmath2 and hcn with outflows become very clear at the small scales traced by bima . emission is found north of smm  3 and smm  4 , along the directions of the jets of these sources .",
    "an emission peak , especially prominent in hcn , is located @xmath14 northwest of smm  4 .",
    "the velocity - centroid of the emission around this peak stands out as extremely blue , at @xmath15 km  s@xmath9 from systemic .",
    "the likely interpretation of this peak is a ` shock front ' of a jet impacting a cloud fragment , although no obvious driving source is present .",
    "possible candidates are a jet from ( the vicinity of ) smm  1 or from ( the vicinity of ) smm  4 . in the latter case",
    "it may be argued that at the ` shock front ' this jet deflects off a cloud condenstation and later connects up with the outflow lobe marked ` wr ' in the co map of @xcite .",
    "interferometers are only sensitive to small - scale emission , and filter out emission on spatial frequencies below the smallest antenna separation . compared to the kp12 m data that do cover these scales ,",
    "the bima data contain @xmath16% of the flux .",
    "while this is only a small fraction of the emission , the similarity in distribution of the emission in the kp12 m and bima maps suggests that outflows contribute significantly to the total emission of hco@xmath2 and hcn .",
    "hogerheijde ( in prep . ) analyses the emission and the abundances quantitatively .",
    "close inspection of the hcn and n@xmath3h@xmath2 bima maps near the tip of smm  3 s jet and near the ` shock front ' reveals that n@xmath3h@xmath2 peaks @xmath17 ahead of hcn .",
    "the structure of c - type shocks ( @xcite ) may offer an explanation for this offset .",
    "c - type shocks have a magnetic precursor where charged particles accelerate and warm up ahead of neutral particles , enhancing the intensity of n@xmath3h@xmath2 emission lines .",
    "deeper into the shock the neutrals accelerate and warm up .",
    "if the pre - shock density is sufficiently high , dust grains will be predominately neutral , and it is in this region that they will release the contents of their ice mantles .",
    "these include hcn , as seen toward other outflow ( @xcite ) , water , and co. the latter two effectively destroy n@xmath3h@xmath2 through chemical reactions , causing the n@xmath3h@xmath2 emission to disappear where the hcn peaks .",
    "a quantitative model has to include time scales , length scales , and an adequate chemical network , and is discussed in hogerheijde ( in prep . ) .",
    "high - angular resolution observations with , e.g. , the smithsonian millimeter array , can help test this model .",
    "aperture - synthesis and single - dish maps of the serpens star - forming region show that n@xmath3h@xmath2 accurately traces the distribution of the cloud material , while hco@xmath2 and especially hcn probe material that is shocked by outflows .",
    "unresolved observations of the latter two species therefore would reflect star - forming activity rather than cloud column density .",
    "a difference map of n@xmath3h@xmath2 and hcn may be a useful tool to identify regions in cloud complexes that are actively star forming , as opposed to dense but quiescent . on small scales ,",
    "however , n@xmath3h@xmath2 emission may be enhanced in magnetic precursors of c - type shocks , but appears effectively destroyed in the warmest regions of shocks where hcn peaks ."
