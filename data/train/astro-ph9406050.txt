    "observations of fluctuations in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) can provide important constraints on cosmological models .",
    "large angular scale ( @xmath0 ) observations probe the initial conditions , in particular the amplitude and the slope of primordial power spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these scales could also provide information on the geometry and the matter content of the universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , theoretical interpretation of measurements on these scales is complicated by cosmic variance and this intrinsically limits the accuracy with which these parameters can be estimated using large angular scale measurements alone .",
    "while small scale measurements suffer less from cosmic variance , their interpretation is complicated by the microphysics during recombination and/or reionization .",
    "theoretical models often give wildly different predictions for the anisotropy power spectra when the parameter values are only slightly changed , while some combinations of parameters seem to provide nearly identical spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to clarify which combinations of physical parameters affect the cmb fluctuations and what are the physical processes that lead to these fluctuations .",
    "our two - fluid model for adiabatic fluctuations , presented in  2 , generalizes previous theoretical approximations that investigated cmb fluctuations in the limiting cases of large and small angles ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the model is accurate enough that it can be used for a quantitative analysis of various models , yet it is also simple enough that it can clearly separate between different physical processes that affect the cmb fluctuations . in ",
    "we use this model to identify the physical parameters that can be determined using cmb measurements over a large angular range , extending previous studies that were limited to a smaller range of angles and/or parameters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in ",
    "4 we present the conclusions .",
    "in this section we present a method for computing the cmb anisotropies that is a generalization of analytic methods first introduced by sachs & wolfe ( 1966 ) and is based on the line - of - sight integration along the photon past light cone .",
    "we will assume that the photons and baryons are tightly coupled prior to recombination , which will allow a simple two - fluid description of perturbations ( @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis will be restricted to the linear perturbation theory of adiabatic perturbations and we will neglect any possible tensor contributions .",
    "different theoretical models will be compared using angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the multipole of temperature anisotropy @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the spherical harmonic .",

    "the above expression is written in the gauge invariant formalism ( @xcite ) .",
    "we neglected the anisotropic stress contribution and the unobservable monopole contribution arising from the local gravitational potential . in the limit of infinitely thin lss",
    "the function @xmath21 approaches to a dirac delta - function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the conformal time at recombination . equation [ bolt - sol ] then reduces to ( kodama & sasaki 1984 ) @xmath24    the velocity term in equation [ bolt - sol - rec ] can be rewritten using the linear theory approximation @xmath25 into @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the radial coordinate .",
    "we may decompose the sources in equation [ bolt - sol - rec ] into an orthonormal spherical basis set with fourier amplitudes @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "after the angular and ensemble averaging we obtain the following expression for the multipole moments ( @xcite ) , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spherical bessel functions and @xmath34 its derivative .",

    "the functions @xmath33 need to be substituted by their appropriate generalizations .",
    "this is unimportant for @xmath39 and the results presented here will be valid for non - flat universes , provided that the relation between angles and physical sizes is expressed using angular size distances .",

    "the photon evolution equations in @xmath35-space are given by ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath43 we also need the evolution equations for baryon and cdm perturbations , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the baryon and photon mean densities , respectively .",

    "we replaced neutrino density and velocity perturbations with the corresponding photon perturbations .",
    "this becomes invalid on small scales due to the free - streaming of neutrinos , but does not affect significantly the final results .",
    "we also neglected the anisotropic shear and the possible curvature terms .",
    "the above equations are supplemented by the friedmann equation , which at early times ( when a possible cosmological constant or curvature term can be neglected ) is given by @xmath53 the solution to this equation is @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( assuming three flavors of massless neutrinos ) , @xmath56 for the standard recombination , @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the value of matter density today in units of critical density and @xmath59 is the value of hubble constant today in units of 100km / s / mpc",
    ".    we will now assume the tight coupling limit @xmath60 , which is a good approximation on scales larger than the silk damping scale ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we dropped the isw contribution from possible curvature or cosmological constant , which is only important at the lowest values of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the damping transfer function @xmath80 is approximately unity for low values of @xmath78 ( @xmath81 , but gradually decreases afterwards .",
    "its main contributions come from the silk damping and from the finite width of lss .",
    "the first effect can be calculated analytically by expanding equations [ photon ] and [ cdmb ] to second order in @xmath82 and neglecting the effects of gravity and expansion . in the matter - dominated era one",
    "obtains @xmath83 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath84 is the silk damping scale in units of @xmath75 , @xmath85 .",
    "second effect can be analytically estimated by performing the line - of - sight integral in equation [ bolt - sol ] in the limit where the sources are slowly changing over the timescale on which the visibility function @xmath21 is non - negligible ( @xcite ) .",
    "visibility function can be approximated as a gaussian @xmath86 $ ] , where for standard recombination @xmath87 . in the limit @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the wavevector which gives the dominant contribution to @xmath90 )",
    ", we obtain the damping factor @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the damping effects can be written as @xmath92 this works reasonably well for the standard ionization history .",
    "note however that if the limit @xmath88 is not satisfied , then the damping due to the finite thickness of lss is not exponential , but is proportional to @xmath93",
    ". this will be the case , for example , in reionized models .",
    "equations [ eqs]-[transfer ] are all is needed to evaluate the temperature fluctuations . although equations [ eqs ] can not be solved analytically in general , they have analytic solutions in the limits of small and large @xmath94 . in the first limit where the modes are larger than the hubble sphere radius",
    "the amplitude of perturbations at a given time is a constant ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this gives the standard sachs - wolfe expression for cmb fluctuations , as can be verified by evolving the initial conditions in equations [ init ] into the matter - dominated era and neglecting the velocity term in equation [ clfinal ] . in the second limit ( large @xmath94 )",
    "the equations can be solved using the wkb approximation and the solution is given by the acoustic oscillations of photon - baryon plasma ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the intermediate regime , which is of main interest for us , the equations need to be solved numerically , but the physics can be well understood by the two limits above . as shown in figure [ fig1 ] , equations [ eqs ] give an excellent approximation to the exact results over a large range of wavevector @xmath94 .",
    "although the above system of equations is particularly useful for the standard recombination scenarios , one can also use it to calculate anisotropy power spectrum in reionized models . as one can see from equation [ bolt - sol ] , the primary fluctuations will be suppressed by a factor @xmath95 $ ] , where @xmath96 is thomson opacity at recombination .",
    "in addition , there will be secondary fluctuations generated at the new last - scattering surface , which can be calculated using the same method as above , except that one needs to replace @xmath97 with @xmath98 in the regime where the compton drag is negligible .",
    "since the modes larger than the hubble sphere radius at the new lss do not evolve in the matter - dominated regime this simply regenerates the sachs - wolfe expression for low values of l. on smaller scales the thick new lss damps the secondary fluctuations and in many scenarios these become negligible ( although on arcminute scales the second - order terms may become important , @xcite ) .",
    "provided that one is interested in degree angular scales , then the effect of reionization is to suppress the fluctuation power spectrum relative to the large scales by a factor of @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "the comparison between our approximation and the exact solutions of perturbed boltzmann equation ( seljak & bertschinger 1994 ; seljak 1994 ) is presented in figure [ fig2 ] for several cosmological models . all of the multipole moments are normalized relative to @xmath100 , which is approximately fixed by the cobe experiment and where the curvature effects and isw effects due to @xmath101 can be neglected .",
    "one can see that the agreement is excellent over a large range of @xmath78 .",
    "the deviations at large @xmath78 arise because of improper treatment of damping effects , while the deviations at small @xmath78 can be attributed to the neglection of neutrino anisotropic shear .",
    "another effect that introduces small deviations is the dependence of @xmath102 on cosmological parameters , which slightly offsets the position of the peaks .",
    "nevertheless , our approximation correctly predicts the positions and amplitudes of doppler peaks ( also called acoustic or sakharov oscillations ) with a 20 % accuracy over most of parameter range .",
    "given the high accuracy of our model we may now investigate how the anisotropy power spectrum depends on the cosmological model .",
    "our goal is to identify the parameters that can be determined using the cmb measurements and to give a physical understanding of how they affect the anisotropies . in equations [ eqs ] the free parameters are @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we can replace them with physically more relevant parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "in addition to these two we have the parameters @xmath96 , @xmath107 , @xmath74 and @xmath84 .",
    "these six parameters will uniquely determine all the cmb power spectra within our approximation .",
    "of the parameters above , @xmath107 , @xmath96 and @xmath84 all suppress the power on small scales relative to large scales ( for @xmath108 ) .",
    "the suppression is different in the three cases , being proportional to @xmath109 ( neglecting the possible tensor contribution ) , @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath110 , respectively .",
    "this , in principle , allows to separate the different suppression effects and to determine the three parameters separately ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "note that these parameters do not change the positions of the doppler peaks , only their amplitude .",
    "since the effects of these parameters are physically transparent , we will restrict in the following to the case of @xmath111 and @xmath112 . moreover , silk damping is important only for large values of @xmath78 and it can be neglected if one concentrates on the first few doppler peaks .",
    "we are thus left with @xmath74 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which uniquely determine positions of the doppler peaks .",
    "position of the first doppler peak is determined by the angular size of the hubble sphere radius at decoupling , which , expressed in terms of our variables is given by @xmath115 . since @xmath116 for typical values of @xmath113 ,",
    "position of the first doppler peak mainly depends on @xmath74 .",
    "assuming @xmath117 we have @xmath118 for the model with negligible cosmological constant and @xmath119 for the model with negligible curvature .",
    "the latter result shows that the first doppler peak only weakly depends on @xmath120 .",
    "this is because the angular size distance at large redshifts scales with @xmath121 in approximately the same way as does the hubble sphere radius at decoupling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is , however , not true in general and the position of the first doppler peak depends on @xmath121 and @xmath122 when both curvature and cosmological constant are important .",
    "the value of @xmath78 at which the maximum of the first doppler peak lies is given approximately by @xmath123 .",
    "figure [ fig3]a compares @xmath90 s of curvature and cosmological constant dominated models with those of @xmath42 model at fixed values of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "one can see that the position of the first doppler peak can accurately determine @xmath121 in curvature dominated universe ( @xcite ) , but can not precisely determine @xmath121 in cosmological constant dominated universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , even in this model the positions of secondary doppler peaks are already significantly displaced relative to each other when @xmath121 changes from 0.25 to 1 .",
    "this would thus allow independent determination of @xmath121 even in cosmological constant dominated universe , once @xmath113 and @xmath114 are known ( see below ) .",
    "the dependence of the doppler peak positions and amplitudes on @xmath114 and @xmath113 is more complicated , since both parameters appear in the evolution equations [ eqs ] and change the properties of acoustic oscillations . moreover , the two parameters enter into the equations differently and have different physical effects : @xmath114 is related to the properties of photon - baryon plasma and determines its effective sound velocity at recombination , whereas @xmath113 is related to the time evolution of the expansion factor , since it determines the epoch of matter - radiation equality .",
    "this means that one can not expect the anisotropy spectra to remain invariant under a certain combination of the two parameters and both @xmath114 and @xmath113 are required for a complete description of the doppler peaks .",
    "figures [ fig3]b and [ fig3]c show how the doppler peaks change when one of the two parameters is changing while the other is held fixed .",
    "if one concentrates on the first doppler peak then it is not possible to determine the two parameters simultaneously , since both increasing @xmath114 and decreasing @xmath113 lead to an increase in the first doppler peak .",
    "the physical mechanisms that lead to this are different : while an increase in @xmath114 increases the amplitude of the first wave in @xmath97 and @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , a decrease in @xmath113 also leads to an increased isw contribution .",
    "once the secondary peaks are observed as well , then different effects of the two parameters become significant and allow one to determine the two parameters simultaneously ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] b , c , d ) . figure [ fig3]d shows how changing @xmath113 at a fixed value of @xmath125 affects the multipole moments .",
    "again , since the epoch of matter - radiation equality is changing with @xmath113 , one does not expect the multipole moments to remain unchanged and both our approximation and exact calculations confirm this .",
    "therefore , changing @xmath59 at a fixed @xmath126 and @xmath121 changes the anisotropy power spectrum , contrary to some recent claims ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the approximation for calculating anisotropy power spectrum presented here is a generalization of the sachs - wolfe approximation , which itself is only valid on scales larger than the hubble sphere radius at recombination . by modelling the cosmological perturbations as a two - component fluid plasma we extended this approach to all scales .",
    "the approximation is useful both for developing the physical understanding of processes that affect cmb fluctuations , as well as for a quantitative prediction of multipole moments for various cosmological models .",
    "the main approximations used in our model are a two - fluid approximation , neglection of anisotropic shear , a simplified treatment of thomson scattering effects , neglection of curvature effects and neglection of vector and tensor contributions .",
    "none of these assumptions is essential for the method and one can generalize the approach presented here to obtain exact results ( seljak 1994 ) .",
    "this will lead to a computationally more demanding system of equations , but the main physical effects that lead to the creation of doppler peaks will still be determined by the equations presented in this letter .    by rewriting the equations in their dimensionless form we identified all the dimensionless parameters that affect the anisotropy power spectra .",
    "measurements of cmb fluctuations can only determine these parameters .",
    "for example , neutrinos enter into our equations indirectly through the friedmann equation [ friedmann ] and through the energy - momentum constraint equations [ constr ] .",
    "the presence of a massive neutrino only weakly changes these equations and the resultant multipole moments are almost indistinguishable from the ones with the massless neutrino .",
    "therefore , the question of whether neutrino has a mass has little hope to be answered using the cmb measurements .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the cmb power spectra is the peculiar pattern of the doppler peaks , which allows a simultaneous determination of @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",
    "this would provide an independent test of nuclesynthesis prediction of @xmath114 ( e.g. @xcite ) and would also constrain the parameter space on @xmath121 and @xmath59 . in addition , the position of the first doppler peak determines @xmath121 in curvature dominated model . in cosmological constant dominated model the position of the first doppler peak does not allow one to determine @xmath121 accurately , but positions of secondary doppler peaks could be used to constrain @xmath121 ( although for accurate determination exact calculations should be used in this case ) .",
    "another way to break the degeneracy between @xmath121 , @xmath126 and @xmath59 is to determine the silk damping scale @xmath84 , which depends only on these three parameters and can not be expressed as a combination of @xmath114 and @xmath113 .",
    "this would require a separation of silk damping from the damping due to the finite thickness of lss in reionized models and from the @xmath108 suppression of small scales relative to large scales ( including the possible tensor contribution ) .",
    "this is possible , because the three effects suppress the small scale power differently .",
    "thus , a combination of cmb measurements over a large range of angles could be used to separately determine the baryon mass density , matter mass density and the hubble constant value .",
