    "[ convert ] ( b ) ) . the flipper a maps the input capital @xmath297 to @xmath298 under the constraint @xmath299 ,",
    "so do the flippers @xmath300 .",
    "different flipper produce different ratio between output capital and input capital , we denote this ratio @xmath301 as amplification , @xmath302 , here @xmath303 is the label of the flipper .",
    "the amplification of a flipper is always negative , @xmath304 .",
    "if we play flipper a , it always lose , any positive capital turns out to be negative . but flipper a also transform negative capital into positive capital .",
    "if we play two flipper @xmath173 , the output of the first a is the input of the second a , then the positive input capital at the first a will give out a positive output at the second a. the amplification of the double a game is @xmath305 , @xmath306 .",
    "if we play a sequence of flipper @xmath307 , the final amplification is @xmath308 .",
    "for the most general case , the product of a sequence of flipper , @xmath309 , the final amplification is @xmath310 if @xmath311 , @xmath312 , it is losing game . if @xmath313 , @xmath314 , it is winning game .",
    "the input and output of any flipper must be classical variables .",
    "the player is actually a classical observer .",
    "the player make decisions following classic logic .",
    "a flipper may have complex internal game process dealing with complex quantum states .",
    "when we try to check the output of a flipper to see it wins or loses , we must measure the weight of those states , all the results will be summarized into a classical number .",
    "therefore the inter - junction between independent flippers is always classical operation , no quantum states could survival .",
    "quantum states may be used to design the internal gaming process within a flipper .",
    "if two independent flipper are perfectly organized into one combined flipper , then the old interface between single flippers disappeared .",

    "quantum states can be used to design the internal structure of single flipper .",
    "for example , we choose electron with spin as player .",
    "the winning state is more spin - up than spin down , the losing state is the opposite case . the input electrons may be all spin - ups",
    ". then we design various complex scattering process within the flipper , such as two slits , many slits , magnetic field , electric field , other fixed nuclear spin , and so on . on the output side , we measure the state of all output electron .",
    "if the total number of spin - ups is more than those spin down , the game wins , this is not successful flipper .",
    "this design must be abandoned and start a new design until we get more spin - down than spin - up .",
    "once we get a flipper with quantum internal structure , and make a good interface between the output of one flipper and the input another flipper , one can play the game paradox using many copies of the same flipper . from a global point of view , this is a classical game .",
    "if we go inside every flipper , it is a quantum processor .",
    "a single flipper does not results in so - called game paradox .",
    "it is only when we combine many flippers in a complex way , the player can not read out the final output at first sight , the total game will produce seemly strange results . to find out the output of flipper network has a lot of things in common with many body physics . especially when the flipper are quantum processors , we are essentially manipulating various entangled quantum states from local flipper to reach a global winning output .",

    "but if all the subgames labeled by @xmath315 are the same , so does the game with label @xmath316 .",
    "we have only two variables which are distributed on the whole lattice , it is an interesting question to ask wether the combined game wins or loses .    to find out the final output of flipper network has a lot of things in common with many body physics .",
    "especially when the flipper are quantum processors , we are essentially manipulating various entangled quantum states from local flipper to reach a global winning output . many coupled identical flippers on a regular lattice can be theoretically summarized into a many body hamiltonian system .",
    "each flipper represents one losing game , this many body system represent a complex game of many coupled losing sub - games .",
    "we interested in the existence of a winning combined game out of many losing games , or the opposite case .",
    "although this is no longer a paradox due to the strong coupling between neighboring losing games , it is still an interesting question .",
    "i will take many ising spins on square lattice as an example to show how to model a quantum many body system into a combined game of many losing sub - games .",

    "the game rule is to minimize the total energy to reach a ground state .",
    "playing one round of game is performed by operating the hamiltonian on the initial configuration once .",
    "the output state after @xmath339 rounds of game is @xmath340 the spin configuration at each round of game must make sure that the total energy @xmath341 decreases comparing with last round of game . we take @xmath342 as the positive capital for the game , if it becomes @xmath6 in the end , the game lost .",
    "the total game covers many sub - games .",
    "if we input less @xmath343 , but end up with more @xmath343 than our input , the games wins .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ ising ] ) is equivalent to the familiar ising hamiltonian @xmath344 .",
    "theoretical physicist always search for the stable spin configurations of ground state starting from an arbitrary initial configuration , especially in quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "the so - called game paradox appears almost everywhere in many different quantum models . in mind of the great interest on time series in stochastic dynamics ,",
    "what quantum monte carlo simulation has abandoned during the process of finding ground states maybe can help people to design winning games by combining a large number of lost sub - games . on the other hand ,",
    "the so - called game paradox remind us that designing different non - equilibrium game process maybe leads to different physical properties of many body system .",
    "when we divide a complex winning game into many sections , each section has an input and output , we call it a sub - game . every sub - game must be tested to see wether it is a losing or winning game .",
    "it is not against intuition that if all sub - games are lost .",
    "more over , if we combine these sub - games together but in a different order as the original one , it is not against intuition either if the combined game is a losing game .",
    "no mater it is dividing or combining , we are dealing with the correlations between those sub - games .",
    "a real game paradox only exist when there is no any correlation between sub - games . in that case ,",
    "any conclusion about the total game based on the result of sub - games are not reasonable .",
    "both parrondo - harmer - abbott game and parrondo s game introduced the correlation of probabilities between the nearest two rounds of game . in mind of a fact that the first round and the second round are the nearest neighbor , the second round and the third round are also nearest neighbor , and so forth , it forms a long chain of many coupled sub - games in history . in my optical analogy , the photon propagates through a long path connecting many beam splitters .",
    "the photon is either reflected or transmitted at each beam splitter .",
    "the final intensity of this photon is the product of the reflection or transmission coefficient of every beam splitter along this path .",
    "the more rounds of game one played , the more paths one would have .",
    "we sum up the intensity of all possible paths to reach the final output .",
    "if we have more transmitted photon than reflected photons , the final gain would be positive , the game wins , otherwise the game lost .",
    "if the photon is reflected for odd number of times , its contribution to the final gain is negative .",
    "if the photon is reflected even number of times , its contribution is positive .",
    "since reflection photon can transmit through or reflected by other beam splitter , the lost of one local sub - game can become positive when a negative photon is reflected again by another beam splitter .",
    "both parrondo - harmer - abbott game and parrondo s game can be mapped exactly into the propagation of a photon through the array of beam splitters .    to implement parrondo - harmer - abbott game",
    ", we can use the same type of physical beam splitters with different transmission and reflection coefficient .",
    "while to implement parrondo s old game , we need two different types of beam splitter : one add a @xmath8 phase shift to its reflection , the other does not .",
    "there is modular operation in parrondo s old game that the capital in game must be checked to see if it can be divided by a integer or not .",
    "this modular operation is equivalent to a special beam splitter from the point view of probability distribution .",
    "if we put this special beam splitter aside and only compare the optical diagram structure of parrondo - harmer - abbott game and parrondo s old game , they are essentially same . parrondo - harmer - abbott game and parrondo s game simulate the random sequence of combing game a and game b , the final game is winning .",
    "in fact , what really matters is the coupling between the two steps in game b , no matter how random the sequence of @xmath345 are , it does not break the internal coupling inside game b. it is through the coupled two steps , or in other words , through two neighboring beam splitters , the probability of negative capital is transformed into the probability of positive capital .",
    "this lies in the heart of a winning combined game out of losing games .",
    "we come to the conclusion : there is no paradox in both parrondo - harmer - abbott game and parrondo s old game , these two games are both reasonable and share the same strategy of coupling the nearest two rounds of game .",
    "this is a good news to gamblers for they can win from loss by reasonable calculations without worrying about paradox .",
    "one can design much more complex games by drawing optical diagrams following the same strategy i used .",
    "a three - step history - dependent game is designed as an example to show how to combine many games . in this game , even if all the sub - games lost , the output of this combined game can win , lose or oscillating between loss and win .",
    "different probability distribution leads to different results . to calculate the final output",
    ", one can draw all the paths connecting beam splitters .",
    "the final gain of each path is derived by multiplying the value of probability of all the bonds along this path .",
    "summing up all the paths gives the final gain .",
    "a real photon propagating across array of beam splitters provide a practical way to test the complex design .",
    "since correlation can make losing games win , it is a good strategy to implant more correlations among sub - games .",
    "i designed a history entangled game with only two sub - games .",
    "the input state of each sub - game depends on the symmetric or antisymmetric combination of the historical states two steps earlier . in the symmetric states ,",
    "two winning sub - games may leads to a lost combined game .",
    "if one of them wins , the game can win . in the antisymmetric state , two losing game results in a winning combined game .",
    "if one wins , the other lost , the output is either lose or win , it depends on specific parameters . in some parameter region , the final gain oscillates between win and loss .",
    "we can implant strong correlations into the capital instead of sub - games .",
    "this is in case if one can not modify the game rule , but one can change the way of playing the capital in hand .",
    "suppose one has @xmath266 points in the beginning , we cut it into many pieces , @xmath346 .",
    "then we invest the capital in game according to a wave pattern , such as @xmath347 ^ 2+\\sin[t+\\tau]^2 $ ] , @xmath348 is the delay time . when this capital wave propagates through the lattice of many coupled sub - games , the outputs of sub - games are strongly entangled . to determine the final output of these quantum entangled states is equivalent to solve a quantum many body physics problem . for example , when we search for the spin configuration of ground state on a lattice , usually it starts from a random initial spin configuration , this initial configuration can be viewed as input capital of a game",
    ". then we update the initial configuration by applying a functional of hamiltonian operator , this is a process of combined game , every local operator on single lattice is a sub - game .",
    "the final output of the game is stable spin configuration .",
    "this is how quantum monte carlo simulation runs everyday .",
    "in fact , monte carlo method , as its name suggested , comes from gamble games .",
    "coupled many sub - games is useful for designing various complex brownian ratchet .",
    "the one dimensional periodic asymmetric potential is equivalent to a chain of many beam splitters .",
    "if a flashing brownian can cover two or more potential well within one period , we must take into account of the coupling between two or more neighboring potential wells .",
    "the forward velocity is determined by summing up continuous two steps of pass or refelection .",
    "the backward velocity is determined by the joint probability of one reflection followed one pass or vice verse .",
    "the optical model provide a tool to analyze the relationship between different individual potential wells .",
    "especially when there are many different individual local potential wells distributed along the long chain . if each local potential well has different reflection and transmission , it is hard to see the physics directly from fokker - planck equation or smoluchowski equation . in that case , we take every local potential well as a different beam splitter , draw the optical diagram , then one will get at least a phenomenological understanding ."
