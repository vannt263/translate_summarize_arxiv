    "sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 is an oxide with a lattice structure similar to the well known high temperature superconductor la@xmath9ba@xmath10cuo@xmath1 @xcite with ruthenium replacing copper . when pure it becomes a superconductor at t@xmath11=1.5k and is one of the best candidates for spin triplet superconductivity @xcite .    in spite of many convincing arguments for @xmath12wave pairing the proper symmetry of three",
    "band superconducting order parameter is still unknown .",
    "the muon spin rotation experiments @xcite indicate the existence time reversal symmetry breaking , consistent with the order parameter @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 . at the same time",
    "many thermodynamic properties show power low temperature dependences at low t , clearly pointing at the existence of nodes in the order parameter .",
    "the experiments on specific heat @xcite , penetration depth @xcite and thermal conductivity @xcite all show a quadratic dependence on temperature .",
    "this is surprising since a complete symmetry analysis of @xmath12wave pairing in tetragonal crystals shows no states which both break time reversal and possess line nodes @xcite .    in the literature there",
    "exist a number of proposals for the relevant symmetry states @xcite .",
    "most of them concentrate on two dimensional band models with p - wave symmetry states . here",
    "we propose to start with the real three dimensional electron energy spectrum with all three bands ( called @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) taken into account and allow for both in plane and out plane p - wave symmetries of the order parameter .",
    "in the next section we present our hamiltonian and the approach , which is the full solution of the bogolubov - de gennes equations at each point of the three dimensional brillouin zone . in principle our theory does not contain free parameters . by fitting the calculated fermi surface to the experimentally determined one we fixed the single particle parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the remaining three interaction parameters have been fitted by requiring that all three bands have a single superconducting transition temperature ( i.e. the monotonic low t behaviour of the specific heat ) and a correct value of the transition temperature . using the parameters we have solved the bogolubov - de gennes equations .",
    "the obtained gap functions have been used to calculate penetration depth and thermal conductivity .",
    "we start with the description of the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 in the vicinity of the fermi energy @xmath16 in the normal state .",
    "we consider three orbitals of ruthenium a , b , c of character @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "these generate 3 fermi surface sheets @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the @xmath2 and @xmath3 sheets arise from hybridised a and b orbitals which we model with hopping parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , which describe aa ( bb ) hopping in x(y ) direction , aa ( bb ) hopping in y(x ) direction and ab hopping , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 sheet arises form the c orbitals , which we model by hopping parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 for nearest and next nearest neighbour sites .",
    "we have fitted these parameters to the de haas - van alphen experimental cross - sections of the fermi surface @xcite . to allow for the three dimensional fermi surface",
    "@xcite we add the hopping parameter @xmath25 which we assume to take on the same value for each band .",
    "= 4.0 cm = 4.0 cm    due to the symmetry of the orbitals and the body centered tetragonal symmetry of the crystal we assumed that the dominant pairing interactions were in plane @xmath26 for the @xmath4 band , and inter - plane @xmath27 for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "each of these was tuned by fitting to the experimental superconducting critical temperature @xmath28 k , so we have no free parameters .",
    "our strategy is to solve the bogolubov - de gennes equations to find the pairing potentials and energy spectrum .",
    "we allowed for the following general structure of the pairing potential    @xmath29   \\cos{(k_z c/2 ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\delta_{z\\prime}^{\\nu,\\nu\\prime } \\sin{(k_zc/2 ) } \\cos{(k_x/2 ) } \\cos{(k_y/2 ) } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in units where the lattice constant , @xmath30 , and where indices @xmath31 , @xmath32 take the values @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "= 4.6 cm    = 4.8 cm    = 4.9 cm = 4.9 cm    for the given set of parameters the only nonzero pairing potentials have the following symmetry @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "each of these solutions therefore breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "moreover , due to the factor @xmath36 ( eq .",
    "1 ) we have planes of zeros on the @xmath2 and @xmath3 sheets for @xmath37 .    to illustrate the structure of the gap on the fermi surface we have plotted in fig .",
    "1 the eigenvalues for the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sheets . figure ( 1a ) illustrates clearly the zero eigenvalues in the @xmath3 band on the planes @xmath37 .",
    "the structure of the gap on the @xmath2 sheet is very similar .",
    "contrary to that the gap on the @xmath4 band ( fig .",
    "1b ) is always finite but has strong modulation in the ( x , y ) plane .",
    "the temperature dependence of the gap parameters is shown in fig . 2a and the specific heat in fig .",
    "the overall agreement with the experimental data is good .",
    "in particular the height of the step at @xmath38 and the linear dependence of @xmath39 on temperature agree with experiment @xcite .    for the above state",
    "we have also calculated the penetration depth @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "3a ) and the thermal conductivity @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "the penetration depth shows a close to linear dependence on temperature at low @xmath42 and agrees approximately with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "note that impurity scattering or other effects may change the low temperature power low .",
    "the thermal conductivity is quadratic as expected for a gap with line nodes .",
    "using a realistic three band model of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 we have found a @xmath12wave pairing state which has nodes and breaks time reversal symmetry .",
    "the state has @xmath43 $ ] ( axial ) pairing symmetry in the notation of @xcite .",
    "the line node on the @xmath2 , @xmath3 sheets is a consequence of the specific form assumed for the pairing interaction .",
    "the state we have found is of similar nature as the one proposed on different grounds in @xcite .",
    "our model contains only attractive interactions unlike one proposed in @xcite .",
    "the nice feature of our model is that we have no adjustable parameters .",
    "the state we obtained leads to correct temperature dependence of not only specific heat but also the penetration depth and thermal conductivity .",
