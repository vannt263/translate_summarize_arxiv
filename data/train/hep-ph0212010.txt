    "suppose a higgs boson is discovered at the lhc , and its properties are observed to coincide ( within experimental error ) to those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "moreover , suppose that evidence for supersymmetry is found , which suggests that in the minimal version of the model ( mssm ) , the observed higgs boson is the lightest state of a two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "finally , imagine that no evidence for the heavier higgs states at the lhc is found . with precision measurements at a future high energy",
    "@xmath5 linear collider ( lc ) , can one determine the mass scale of the heavier higgs states ?    at the lhc , more than one higgs scalar of the mssm will often be observed if @xmath6 ( due to enhanced higgs couplings to down - type fermions ) .",
    "but , there is also a substantial region of moderate @xmath2 in which only the lightest cp - even higgs scalar ( @xmath0 ) is observed  @xcite .",
    "if the properties of @xmath0 approximate those of the sm higgs boson ( @xmath7 ) , a program of precision higgs measurements at the lc will play a critical role in elucidating the physics of higgs bosons .",
    "given a non - minimal higgs sector , the decoupling limit corresponds to the parameter regime in which all but one cp - even neutral higgs scalar are significantly heavier than the @xmath8 .",
    "the properties of the lightest cp - even higgs boson are nearly indistinguishable from those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson .",
    "the decoupling limit is very general and exists in many multi - higgs models .",
    "the mssm higgs sector provides a well - motivated example for the decoupling limit and is the main focus of this work .",
    "first , consider the general 2hdm .",
    "the most general scalar potential is given by : & & = m_11 ^ 2_1^_1+m_22 ^ 2_2^_2 -[m_12 ^ 2_1^_2+h.c . ]",

    ". since the ground state must preserve u(1)@xmath9 , the scalar vacuum expectation values are @xmath10 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    diagonalizing the cp - even higgs squared - mass matrix yields two cp - even scalar eigenstates : & = & -(_1 ^ 0-v_1)+ ( _ 2 ^ 0-v_2 ) , + & = & ( _ 1 ^ 0-v_1)+ ( _ 2 ^ 0-v_2 ) , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the other higgs scalars of the model include a cp - odd state , @xmath15 , and a charged scalar pair , @xmath16 .",
    "the decoupling limit is defined as the limit of @xmath17 , assuming @xmath18 .",
    "one can show that this limit corresponds to taking @xmath19 ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath20 . in the approach to the decoupling limit",

    "it follow that : ( i ) @xmath22 , ( ii ) @xmath23 , up to corrections of @xmath24 , and ( iii ) @xmath25 .    the couplings of the higgs bosons to vector bosons , fermions and scalars typically depend on @xmath26 and @xmath27 . by examining the tree - level couplings of the lightest cp - even scalar @xmath0 , one notes that in the limit of @xmath28 , the couplings of @xmath0 reduce to the corresponding sm higgs couplings .",
    "that is , in the approach to the decoupling limit , the properties of @xmath0 are nearly indistinguishable from those of the sm higgs boson , whereas all the other higgs states are significantly heavier .",
    "thus , the effective low energy theory below the mass scale of @xmath29 is the standard model with one higgs doublet .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is a two - higgs doublet model , with interactions constrained by supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "it particular , [ susylams ] & & v^2=^2 ^2,_4 v^2=-2 ^ 2 , + & & v^2=^2,_a v^2=^2 c_4 , and @xmath30 .",

    "it is possible for the theory to exhibit a sm - like higgs boson without decoupling .",
    "for example , assume that @xmath34 .",
    "two cases arise in the 2hdm where @xmath35 :",
    "( i ) @xmath36 , with @xmath18 , and ( ii ) @xmath37 with @xmath4 arbitrary .",
    "( if @xmath38 , replace @xmath2 with @xmath39 above . ) in the mssm , the @xmath3 coupling normalized to its sm value is given by : -=(- ) -(- ) . in case ( i )",
    ", we have @xmath40 even if @xmath41 [ see ] , which implies that the @xmath3 coupling is sm - like ( corresponding to the decoupling limit ) . case ( ii ) does not correspond to decoupling if @xmath42 . if @xmath41 , it is possible to have @xmath43 even if @xmath35 , in which case the @xmath3 coupling deviates from its sm value . nevertheless , for the higgs couplings to @xmath44 , vector bosons and scalars , @xmath0 is sm - like . in the mssm at tree - level ,",
    "@xmath35 is possible only in the decoupling regime [ see ] , corresponding to case ( i ) above .",
    "however , one - loop effects mediated by supersymmetric particles can generate significant modifications to the tree - level mssm higgs sector .",
    "for example , the tree - level upper bound , @xmath45 , can be significantly raised  @xcite . allowing for maximal mixing in the top squark sector and supersymmetric mass parameters of order @xmath46  tev ,",
    "one finds a radiatively - corrected higgs mass bound of @xmath47  gev  @xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate in section 4 that for moderate values of @xmath4 , radiative corrections to @xmath48 can result in @xmath49 in certain regions of the mssm parameter space .",
    "this would correspond to case ( ii ) above , and the @xmath0 of the mssm could indeed exhibit sm - like properties outside the domain of the decoupling limit .",
    "in order to study the decoupling properties of the mssm higgs sector , it is crucial to examine the higgs couplings , including the most significant loop - corrections .",
    "the leading contributions to the radiatively - corrected higgs couplings arise in two ways .",
    "first , the radiative corrections to the cp - even higgs squared - mass matrix results in a shift of the cp - even higgs mixing angle @xmath26 from its tree - level value .",
    "that is , the dominant higgs propagator corrections can to a good approximation be absorbed into an effective ( `` radiatively - corrected '' ) mixing angle @xmath26  @xcite . in this approximation",
    ", we can write : [ calmatrix ] m^2 ( ) = m_0 ^ 2+^2 , where the tree - level contribution is denoted by @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the contribution from the radiative corrections .",
    "then , @xmath52 is given by [ eq : cosbma ] = ( _ 11 ^ 2-_22 ^ 2)2 - 2_12 ^ 222(m_h^2-m_h^2)(- ) .",
    "inserting the tree - level values for @xmath53 , one can rewrite as [ eq : cosbmarad ] & & = m_z^24 2(m_h^2-m_h^2)(- ) + & & + ( _ 11 ^ 2-_22 ^ 2)2 - 2_12 ^ 222(m_h^2-m_h^2)(- ) .",
    "using tree - level higgs couplings with @xmath26 replaced by its effective one - loop value provides a useful first approximation to the radiatively - corrected higgs couplings .",
    "second , contributions from the one - loop vertex corrections to tree - level higgs - fermion couplings can modify these couplings in a significant way , especially in the limit of large @xmath54 .",
    "when radiative corrections are included , all possible dimension - four higgs - fermion couplings are generated .",
    "in particular , the effects of higher dimension operators can be ignored if @xmath55 , which we henceforth assume .",
    "these results can be summarized by an effective lagrangian that describes the coupling of the neutral higgs bosons to the third generation quarks : [ susyyuklag ] -_eff & = & ( h_b + h_b ) |b_r b_l _ 1 ^ 0 + ( h_t + h_t ) |t_r t_l _ 2 ^ 0 + & + & h_t |t_r t_l _ 1 ^ 0 + h_b |b_r b_l _ 2 ^ 0 + h.c . , resulting in a modification of the tree - level relation between @xmath56 [ @xmath57 and @xmath58 [ @xmath59 as follows  @xcite : m_b & = & ( 1 + + ) + & & ( 1 + _ b ) , [ byukmassrel ] + m_t & = & ( 1 + + ) + & & ( 1 + _ t ) .",
    "[ tyukmassrel ] the dominant contributions to @xmath60 are @xmath54-enhanced , with @xmath61 ; whereas for @xmath6 , @xmath62 provides a small correction to @xmath60 .",
    "[ in the same limit , @xmath63 , with the additional contribution of @xmath64 providing a small correction . ]    from we can obtain the couplings of the physical neutral higgs bosons to third generation quarks .",
    "the resulting couplings of @xmath0 to @xmath65 and @xmath44 pairs are given by : g_t|t & = & m_tv + g_b|b & = & -m_bv .",
    "[ hlff ]    we now turn to the decoupling limit .",
    "first consider the implications for the radiatively - corrected value of @xmath52 . since @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , one finds  @xcite @xmath68\\,,\\ ] ] in the limit of @xmath1 , where @xmath69 equivalently",
    ", the radiative corrections have modified the tree - level definition of @xmath48 : [ lamhatrad ] v^2= c^222 .",
    "exhibits the expected decoupling behavior for @xmath33 .",
    "however , exhibit another way in which @xmath70 can be achieved  simply choose the mssm parameters ( which govern the higgs mass radiative corrections ) such that the right hand side of vanishes .",
    "that is , @xmath71 this condition is equivalent to @xmath72 , which implies @xmath73 [ ] and thus corresponds to case ( ii ) in section 3 .",
    "that is , although @xmath74 at tree - level , the one - loop radiative corrections to @xmath48 can approximately cancel its tree - level value , resulting in @xmath49 .",
    "( note that the one - loop corrections arise from the exchange of supersymmetric particles , whose contributions can be enhanced for certain mssm parameter choices .",

    "typically , yields a solution at large @xmath54 .",

    "if @xmath4 is not much larger than @xmath80 , then @xmath0 is a sm - like higgs boson outside the decoupling regime .    finally , note that for @xmath1 , @xmath81   + { \\cal o}\\left(\\frac{\\mz^4}{\\mha^4}\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] applying this result to , it follows that in the decoupling limit , @xmath82 .",
    "away from the decoupling limit , the higgs couplings to down - type fermions can deviate significantly from their tree - level values due to enhanced radiative corrections at large @xmath54 [ where @xmath83 . in particular , because @xmath84 , the leading one - loop radiative correction to @xmath85 is of @xmath86 , which decouples only when @xmath87 ( this behavior was called _",
    "delayed decoupling _ in @xcite ) .",
    "as noted in section 1 , a program of precision higgs measurements at the lc may be critical in determining whether the properties of the lightest cp - even higgs boson differ from those of @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , recent simulations of higgs branching ratio measurements  @xcite suggest that the higgs couplings to vector bosons and the third generation fermions can be determined with an accuracy in the range of 13% at the lc . in the exact decoupling limit ( of infinitely large @xmath4 ) , @xmath88 .",
    "however , for finite values of @xmath4 , the fractional deviations of the couplings of @xmath0 relative to those of @xmath7 scale as @xmath89 .",
    "thus , if precision measurements reveal a significant deviation from sm expectations , one could in principle derive a constraint ( _ e.g. _ , upper and lower bounds ) on the heavy higgs masses of the model .    in the mssm ,",
    "this constraint is sensitive to the supersymmetric parameters that control the radiative corrections to the higgs couplings .",
    "this is illustrated in , where the constraints on @xmath4 are derived for two different sets of mssm parameter choices  @xcite . here",
    ", a simulation of a global fit of measured @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 couplings is made ( based on the anticipated experimental accuracies given in @xcite ) and @xmath93 contours are plotted indicating the constraints in the @xmath75@xmath54 plane , assuming that a deviation from sm higgs boson couplings is seen . in the maximal mixing scenario shown in ( a ) , the constraints on @xmath4 are significant and rather insensitive to the value of @xmath54 . however in some cases , as shown in ( b ) , a region of @xmath54 may yield almost no constraint on @xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to the value of @xmath2 given by , and is a result of @xmath77 generated by radiative corrections [ @xmath94 in ] .",
    "thus , one can not extract a fully model - independent upper bound on the value of @xmath4 beyond the kinematical limit that would be obtained if direct @xmath95 production were not observed at the lc .",
