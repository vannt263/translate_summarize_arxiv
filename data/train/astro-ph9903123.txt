    "when studying a stellar dynamical model ( single or multi  component ) , the fact that the jeans equations have a physically acceptable solution is not a sufficient criterion for the validity of the model : the minimal requirement to be met by a physically acceptable model is the positivity of the phase",
    " space distribution function ( df ) of each distinct component . a model satisfying this essential requirement ( which is much weaker than the stability of the model )",
    "is called a _",
    "consistent _ model ; moreover , when the total potential is determined by the model density components through the poisson equation , the model is called _ self  consistent_. in other words , a self  consistent model represents a physically acceptable , self  gravitating system .",
    "two general strategies can be used to construct a ( self ) consistent model , or check whether a proposed model is ( self ) consistent : they are commonly referred to as the `` @xmath7to@xmath8 '' and the `` @xmath8to@xmath7 '' approaches ( @xcite , chap .",
    "4 , hereafter bt87 ) .",
    "an example of the first approach is the extensive survey of self  consistent two ",
    "component spherical galaxy models carried out by bertin and co  workers ( bertin , saglia , and stiavelli 1992 ) , where they assume for the stellar and dark matter components two distribution functions of the @xmath9 form ( and so positive by choice ; @xcite ) .",
    "the main problem with this approach is that generally the spatial density is not expressible in terms of simple or at least well known functions , and so only numerical investigations are usually feasible .    in the second approach ,",
    "the density distribution is given , and assumptions about the model internal dynamics are made , making the comparison with the data simpler .",
    "the difficulties inherent in the operation of recovering the df in many cases prevent a simple consistency analysis . in particular , in order to recover the df of spherical models with anisotropy , the osipkov  merritt technique ( @xcite , hereafter om ) has been developed from the original eddington ( 1916 ) method for isotropic systems , and widely used .",
    "examples of _ numerical _ application of the om inversion to one and two  component spherical galaxies can be found in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite , hereafter cp92 ; @xcite ; carollo , de zeeuw , and van der marel 1995a ; @xcite , hereafter cl97 ) .",
    "if one is just interested in the ( self ) consistency of a stellar system the previous methods obviously give `` too much '' , i.e. , give the full df . in the om framework , a simpler approach in order to check the ( self ) consistency of spherically symmetric , multi  component models , is given by the method described in cp92 .",
    "this method uses directly the radial density profile of each component and of the total potential , and gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the model ( self ) consistency , avoiding the necessity of recovering the df itself .",
    "moreover , since it requires only spatial differentiation and inequality checks , this method is best suited for analytical investigations .",
    "the importance of studying multi ",
    "component galaxy models can not be underestimated : in fact it is now accepted that a fraction of the mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is made of a dark component , whose density distribution  albeit not well constrained by observations  differs from that of the visible one ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there is increasing evidence for the presence of massive black holes ( bhs ) at the center of most ( if not all ) elliptical galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite , van der marel , de zeeuw , and rix 1997b , @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that the obvious generalization of the one  component spherical models ( the dynamicists zero  th order approximation of real galaxies ) is not only in the direction of the actively developed modeling of axisymmetric and triaxial systems ( see , e.g. , de zeeuw ( 1996 ) for a review ) but also in the direction of the construction of two  component analytical models , and in the study of their phase  space properties , a field far less developed . from this point of view",
    "the @xmath10 order approximation of real galaxies is the construction of analytical , spherically symmetric , ( self ) consistent _ two  component _ galaxy models .",
    "unfortunately , few examples of two  component systems in which both the spatial density and the df are analytically known are available , namely the very remarkable axisymmetric binney ",
    "evans model ( @xcite ) , and the spherically symmetric two  component hernquist model ( hh models , ciotti 1996 , hereafter c96 ) , and so it would be particularly interesting to find other members of this exclusive club . in c96 the ( successful ) choice of the hernquist density distribution ( @xcite , hereafter h90 ) as building block for a two  component model with an analytical df , was suggested by the extremely simple ( and algebraic ) expression of its potential as a function of radius .",
    "moreover , the application of the cp92 method to hh models revealed itself as both simple and fruitful , explaining many properties of the derived df . in this line , a natural and promising extension of the hh models is obtained by considering the wider family of spherically symmetric , two  component , anisotropic @xmath2 models .",
    "this family of models is made by the superposition of two @xmath3 models [ see equation ( 7 ) ] with different total masses , scale  lengths , and slopes @xmath3 .",
    "the mass concentration and amount of mass of the two distributions are described by four free parameters , and orbital anisotropy is allowed in both components , following the om prescription .",
    "because the hernquist profile is obtained from @xmath5 , it will referred as a @xmath5 model , and so with the adopted nomenclature the hh models discussed in c96 will be called ( 1,1 ) models . note that an increasing interest in @xmath2 models is seen in simulation and observational works : e.g. , pellegrini and ciotti ( 1998 ) used @xmath11 models in their numerical simulations of hot gas flows in x  ray emitting elliptical galaxies , loewenstein and white ( 1999 ) used galaxy models similar to @xmath12 models in the inner regions in order to observationally constraint the properties of dark matter halos around ellipticals .",
    "as expected , it is not possible to find the analytical df for @xmath2 models in the general case , but the fact that the df of ( 1,0 ) models with om anisotropy is completely expressible in analytical way , as proved here , is still of great interest .",
    "the study of ( 1,0 ) models is also useful for many other reasons : to provide an analytical df for a two  component system for which the virial quantities and the analytical solution of the jeans equation can be found explicitly ; to arrange initial conditions for numerical simulations of two  component systems ; to investigate the role of anisotropy and mass distribution of each component in determining the positivity of their df .",
    "the availability of the analytical df for a two  component stellar system allows us to arrange with great accuracy the initial conditions for numerical simulations aimed at investigating the stability of galaxy models in the presence of dark matter halos , or with a central bh . a work on stability of ( 1,0 )",
    "models is in progress ( londrillo and ciotti , in preparation ) .",
    "strictly related to the last point above , is the trend shown in the numerical investigations of two  component models described in cp92 , i.e. , the difficulty of consistently superimposing a centrally peaked distribution to a centrally flat one .",
    "cp92 showed numerically that king ( 1972 ) or quasi ",
    "isothermal density profiles can not be coupled to a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) model , because their dfs run into negative values near the model center . on the contrary ,",
    "the df of the de vaucouleurs component is qualitatively unaffected by the presence of centrally flat halos . from this point of view ,",
    "the c96 work on ( 1,1 ) models is complementary to the investigation of cp92 : in the ( 1,1 ) models the two density components are both centrally peaked , and their df is positive ( in the isotropic case ) for all the possible choices of halo and galaxy masses and concentrations .",
    "the implications of these findings have been not explored sufficiently .",
    "one could speculate that in the presence of a centrally peaked dark matter halo , king  like elliptical galaxies should be relatively rare , or that a galaxy with a central power  law density profile can not have a dark halo too flat in the center .",
    "in fact , observations of the central surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; mller , stiavelli , m. , and zeilinger 1995 , @xcite ) , and bulges of spirals ( @xcite ) , as well as high  resolution numerical simulations of dark matter halo formation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; navarro , frenk , and white 1997 ) seem to point in this direction .    in this paper ,",
    "i further explore the trend that emerged in cp92 and in c96 , determining the limits imposed by phase",
    " space constraints ( i.e. , the df positivity ) on the parameters describing the @xmath2 models and @xmath3 models with a central bh [ hereafter ( @xmath3,bh ) models ] .",
    "i focus on the ( 1,0 ) models , in which one component is centrally peaked ( @xmath5 density profile ) , and the other has a more flat core ( @xmath6 density profile ) . with the aid of the derived , analytical dfs ,",
    "more stringent conclusions are then reached .    in section 2 ,",
    "i briefly review the technique developed in cp92 and applied in c96 to ( 1,1 ) models , and i formulate it in a way suitable for its application to the present problem . in section 3 ,",
    "the @xmath2 models are introduced , as well as the cp92 method used to discuss the limits imposed on their parameters by requiring the positivity of the df of the two components . in section 4 , the df for the two components of ( 1,0 )",
    "models are derived explicitly , and in section 5 , the exact boundaries of the region of consistency in the parameter space are obtained and compared to those given in section 3 .",
    "finally , in section 6 , the main results are summarized . in the appendix ,",
    "the analytical expressions for the velocity dispersion profiles of both the ( 1,0 ) model components and the virial quantities useful in applications , are derived in the general om case .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , a stellar system described as a sum of different density components @xmath13 is called consistent if _ each _",
    "@xmath14 is non  negative over all the accessible phase ",
    "space ; a consistent , self  gravitating system is called self  consistent .",
    "the technique developed in cp92 permits us to check whether the df of a multi  component spherical system , where the orbital anisotropy of each component is modeled according to the om parameterization , is positive , _ without _ calculating it effectively . in the om formulation ,",
    "the radially anisotropic case is obtained as a consequence of assuming @xmath15 with : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively the relative energy and the angular momentum modulus per unit mass , @xmath19 is the so  called _ anisotropy radius _ , and @xmath20 for @xmath21 . with this assumption ,",
    "the models are characterized by radial anisotropy increasing with galactic radius , and in the limit as @xmath22 , the velocity dispersion tensor becomes globally isotropic . for a multi",
    " component spherical system , the simple relation between energy and angular momentum prescribed by equation ( 1 ) allows us to express the df of the k  th component as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 is the total relative potential , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the second equivalence in equation ( 2 ) holds for untruncated systems with finite total mass , as the models discussed here ( see , e.g. , bt87 , p.240 ) . in c96",
    ", the original cp92 technique was applied to ( 1,1 ) models using the relative potential @xmath28 of the investigated component as the independent variable , but here the radius @xmath29 is found to be a more convenient variable .",
    "so , we have now : a _ necessary condition _ ( nc ) for the non  negativity of @xmath14 is : @xmath30 if the nc is satisfied , a _ strong sufficient condition _ ( ssc ) for the non  negativity of @xmath14 is : @xmath31\\geq 0 , \\quad 0\\leq r\\leq\\infty .\\ ] ] finally , a",
    "_ weak sufficient condition _ ( wsc ) for the non negativity of @xmath14 is : @xmath32\\geq 0 , \\quad 0\\leq r\\leq\\infty .\\ ] ] : see cp92 and c96 .",
    "some considerations follow from looking at the above conditions .",
    "the first is that the violation of the nc [ equation ( 4 ) ] is connected only to the radial behavior of @xmath13 and the value of @xmath33 , and so this condition applies independently of any other component added to the model .",
    "obviously , the condition imposed by equation ( 4 ) is only necessary , so @xmath14 can be negative ( and so the k component will be inconsistent ) even for values of model parameters allowed by the nc .",
    "this is due to the radial behavior of the integrand in equation ( 2 ) , which not only depends on the particular @xmath13 and @xmath33 , but also on on the total potential .",
    "to summarize : a model failing the nc is _ certainly inconsistent _ , a model satisfying the nc _ can be consistent_. the second consideration is that a model satisfying the wsc ( or the more restrictive ssc ) is _ certainly _ consistent , a model failing the wsc ( ssc ) _ can be consistent _ , due to the sufficiency of the conditions given by equations ( 5)-(6 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the consistency of a model satisfying the nc and failing the wsc ( or the ssc ) can be proved only by direct inspection of its df .",
    "for example , if one find that for @xmath34(nc ) the model is inconsistent [ i.e. , equation ( 4 ) is not verified ] , while for @xmath35(wsc)@xmath36(ssc ) the model is consistent [ i.e. , equations ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) are verified ] , this means that the true critical anisotropy radius ( @xmath37 ) for that model must satisfy the relation @xmath33(nc)@xmath38(wsc)@xmath39(ssc ) . in this case , the limitations on @xmath33 obtained from wsc or ssc , are upper bounds on the lower limit @xmath37 for consistency .",
    "obviously , the situation can be more complicated [ see equations ( 38)-(39 ) , and the following discussion ] .    in the next section , after presenting the @xmath2 models , the analytical constraints on @xmath19 for the consistency of the one  component om anisotropic @xmath3 models are derived , together with a general result on the consistency of two  component isotropic @xmath2 models .",
    "successively , more specific results for the isotropic ( 1,0 ) models are proved .",
    "finally , a limitation on @xmath19 for the om anisotropic ( @xmath3,bh ) models , is explicitly derived as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "both density distributions of the @xmath2 models belong to the widely explored family of the so  called @xmath3 models ( @xcite , hereafter d93 ; @xcite ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total mass and @xmath42 a characteristic scale  length .",
    "the corresponding relative potential is given by @xmath43,\\quad \\psi(r)={gm\\over\\rc}\\ln{r+\\rc\\over r},\\ ] ] where the second expression holds for @xmath44 . in the following , the mass @xmath45 and the characteristic scale ",
    "length @xmath46 of the @xmath0 model will be adopted as normalization constants , so that from equation ( 7 ) it follows @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . the fundamental ingredient in recovering the df is the total potential @xmath53 , where from equation ( 8) @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "with this choice , the @xmath2 models are structurally determined by fixing the four independent parameters @xmath57 , with the obvious condition @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    for future reference",
    ", i give here the explicit expressions of the density and the potential for the ( 1,0 ) models , for which @xmath60 , and @xmath61 : @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ; moreover , @xmath68 @xmath69 with @xmath70 .      here",
    "i study first the nc for the general case of the anisotropic one  component @xmath3 models , in order to determine analytically a _",
    "critical _ anisotropy radius such that a higher degree of radial om anisotropy ( i.e. , a smaller anisotropy radius ) produces a negative df for some permitted value of @xmath71 , no matter what kind of halo density distribution is added .",
    "the unit mass and unit length are the total mass @xmath41 and the scale ",
    "length @xmath42 of the model , with @xmath72 .",
    "as shown in appendix a [ equations ( a1)-(a2 ) ] , for @xmath73 the nc is satisfied for @xmath74 , i.e. , the possibility that @xmath3 models with @xmath75 are assembled using only radial orbits is left open by the nc . on the contrary , for @xmath76",
    "the nc requires @xmath77 where @xmath78 is given by equation ( a2 ) . in this case",
    "the nc _ proves _ that @xmath3 models with @xmath76 can not sustain radial orbits only . in fig .",
    "1 the lower bound for the anisotropy radius as a function of @xmath3 derived from the nc is shown . from the discussion in section 2",
    ", it follows that all @xmath3 models ( one or multi  component ) in the nearly triangular region under the solid curve are inconsistent .",
    "the wsc can be treated analytically for the one ",
    "component @xmath3 models , as shown in appendix a [ equations ( a3)-(a6 ) ] , and we obtain the following limitats on @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is given by equations ( a4)-(a6 ) . as discussed in section 2 , the r.h.s . of equation",
    "( 14 ) ( represented in fig . 1 by the dotted line ) , is an upper limit on the lower bound for the critical anisotropy radius as a function of @xmath3 : all one  component @xmath3 models in the region above the dotted line are consistent .",
    "a stronger limitation on @xmath19 is obtained using the ssc , but unfortunately this condition for a generic @xmath3 results in a trascendental equation that can not be solved explicitly .",
    "however , as shown in appendix a , for the three values @xmath82 the solution can be derived explicitly . for @xmath6 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is given by equation ( a8 ) . for @xmath5 , equation ( a9 )",
    "shows that @xmath85 where @xmath86 is given by equations ( a10)-(a11 ) .",
    "the numerical application of the ssc to the @xmath44 model ( @xcite ) gives @xmath87 .",
    "finally , the case @xmath88 is trivial , the ssc reduces to @xmath74 .",
    "these four values are represented in fig . 1 by black dots : all one  component @xmath3 models in the region above the dashed line are consistent .",
    "note how the ssc improves the estimate of the lower bound of @xmath19 with respect to the wsc .    as already pointed out in section 2",
    ", the true critical value of @xmath79 for any one  component @xmath3 model is between the nc and the ssc curves . for the @xmath6 and @xmath5 models",
    "these values , determined directly from their dfs ( sections b1-b2 in appendix b ) , are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "merritt ( 1985b ) derived the analytical df for a totally radial jaffe model ( the @xmath44 case ) : its positivity implies that in this case the true lower limit on @xmath79 is zero . in fig .",
    "1 these three values are represented by black squares , and in table 1 all the previous results for the specific cases @xmath91 are summarized : note how the more the model is concentrated , the more radial anisotropy can be supported . the true critical @xmath19 value for the om anisotropic one  component @xmath3 models as a function of @xmath3 is numerically known ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "in order to proceed further with this analytical discussion , and to allow for the presence of a `` halo '' component , we will use the wsc rather than the more complicated ssc .",
    "the following three results are proven analytically in this section :    1 .   in the case of globally isotropic two ",
    "component @xmath2 models with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the df of the more peaked component @xmath0 is positive over all the phase space , for all values of @xmath94 . as a consequence , the @xmath5 component of ( 1,0 ) models",
    "is consistent for all values of the parameters @xmath95 .",
    "2 .   in the case of",
    "globally isotropic ( 1,0 ) models , the wsc applied to the @xmath6 density distribution suggests the existence of a lower limit of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath97 . in particular , for @xmath98 , i.e.",
    ", when the @xmath6 component is sufficiently concentrated , all values of @xmath99 can be accepted . using the analytical df the existence of this lower limit",
    "will be proved in section 5 .",
    "3 .   in the case of anisotropic @xmath3 models with a bh at their center , it is possible to determine analytically a lower limit on @xmath19 as a function of @xmath3 using the wsc .",
    "the proof of the first result is conceptually straightforward but algebraically cumbersome . in appendix",
    "a [ equations ( a12)-(a13 ) ] it is proved that under the hypothesis assumed in point 1 above , equation ( 6 ) is verified for all choices of @xmath100 .",
    "i note explicitly that this result contains as a particular case the fact ",
    "already proved in c96  that globally isotropic ( 1,1 ) models can be self ",
    "consistently assembled for any choice of @xmath100 . from this general result",
    "it also follows that ",
    "e.g.  the same is true for isotropic jaffe+jaffe models ( @xmath101 ) . finally , considering that for @xmath102 the potential of @xmath3 models becomes that of a point mass",
    "[ see equation ( 8) ] , the previous result means that a bh of any mass can be added at the center of a globally isotropic @xmath3 model when @xmath103 .",
    "a different analysis , based on a series expansion of the integral representation of the df for isotropic @xmath3 models , shows that the true limit on @xmath3 in order to allow for the presence of a bh of any mass at the models center , is @xmath104 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the result stated in point 2 above is proved in appendix a [ equation ( a14 ) ] . for equation ( 6 ) to be satisfied for the isotropic @xmath6 component of ( 1,0 ) models , a sufficient condition for the consistency of this component is @xmath105 this requirement can be interpreted in two different ways .",
    "the first is that , having fixed the ratio @xmath97 , only for sufficiently high mass ratios @xmath96 can the @xmath6 component `` dilute '' the effect of the central cusp of the @xmath5 model on the total potential , and be consistent .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath106 ( i.e. , when the @xmath6 density distribution is sufficiently concentrated ) , even a vanishing mass @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) can be accepted , while for large @xmath109 only very large @xmath99 are allowed . from another point of view ,",
    "equation ( 17 ) tells us that having fixed @xmath99 , @xmath109 can not be arbitrarily large , but in some sense the concentration of the @xmath6 component must adapt to the density distribution of the @xmath5 component .",
    "the effect of the concentration is much more important than the amount of mass : in fact @xmath110 .",
    "this means that even increasing considerably the mass ratio , the maximum value of @xmath111 allowed for the @xmath6 model grows only like the _ cube _ root of @xmath99 .",
    "the limitation @xmath98 is only a _ sufficient _ condition for the consistency of a @xmath6 model coupled with a dominant @xmath5 : a larger critical value for @xmath109 is expected from direct inspection of the df when @xmath108 ( see section 5 ) .    the result presented in point 3 above can be interpreted as an extension to the radially anisotropic case of the analysis performed by tremaine et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and is proved in appendix a by showing that the wsc applied to the anisotropic ( @xmath3,bh ) models with @xmath103 can be analytically discussed in the special case of a _ dominant _",
    "bh , i.e. , assuming in equation ( 6 ) @xmath112 ( and so @xmath113 ) . unfortunately , in the non ",
    "asymptotic case , the equation to be discussed is transcendental , and no analytical discussion can be carried out . at first , the assumption of a dominant bh could appear as a very rough approximation of reality , but this is not true : the constraint derived can be used as a safe limitation when constructing models containing a bh of a realistic mass at their centre . as shown in appendix a , [ equation ( a15 ) ] , for @xmath103 , @xmath114 where @xmath78 is obtained by solving a fourth degree algebraic equation . in fig .",
    "1 , the long  dashed line represents the lower bound for @xmath79 as determined by the previous equation , while the explicit values for @xmath115 are given in table 1 .",
    "in particular , the critical value for the @xmath5 model was already derived as a limiting case of a ( non  asymptotic ) formula given in c96 [ equation ( 15 ) there ] .",
    "we can now proceed to the explicit recovery of the df of the ( 1,0 ) models .",
    "just as for the density and the potential , it is also useful for the df to work with dimensionless functions ; the two components of the df are of the form @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the easiest way to compute each df is to use the first of the identities in equation ( 2 ) . for the evaluation of the integral one",
    "would be tempted to obtain @xmath119 , eliminating the radius from the modified density and the total potential : formally , this can be done , but the resulting expression for the radial coordinate involves a quadratic irrationality , that , after insertion in equations ( 3 ) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , produces an intractable expression . here",
    "i follow another approach : instead of eliminating the radius , the integration variable is changed from the total potential to the radius itself .",
    "this is equivalent to a remapping of the domain of definition of each @xmath7 , from the range of variation of @xmath120 to the range of variation of @xmath29 , and leads us to introduce the dimensionless radius @xmath121 using equations ( 11)-(12 ) : @xmath122 as shown in appendix b [ equations ( b1)-(b2 ) ] , with this change of variable and after normalization to the dimensional scales of the hernquist density distribution , the df for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components can be formally written as : @xmath123 ,             \\quad\\nu=\\nu ( \\qtil),\\ ] ] where @xmath124 , and the subscripts refer to the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the df , respectively . following the procedure , @xmath125 results from the elimination of @xmath121 between equations ( 19)-(20 ) . in the general case , i.e. , for any choice of @xmath126 , @xmath125 [ and the so called _ differential energy distribution _ for each component as well , ( see , e.g. , bt87 , p.242 ) ]",
    "can be recovered analytically [ see equation ( b3 ) for a proof of this fact ] .",
    "so , it is shown that in addition to the ( 1,1 ) models , the ( 1,0 ) models are a class of two  component stellar systems in which both the spatial density distributions , the solution of the jeans equations ( see appendix c ) , and the phase ",
    "space distribution functions can be explicitly found .",
    "unfortunately , the df of the ( 1,0 ) models results in a combination of elliptic functions , even more complicated than the df of the ( 1,1 ) models , and this limits their applicability to special problems in which the df is required to be known with arbitrary precision or to be formally manipulated .    here",
    "i present only the dfs for the two density distributions obtained under the assumption of a dominant `` halo '' component ; i derive the df for a @xmath5 model with a dominant @xmath6 halo ( @xmath127 ) , and for a @xmath6 model with a dominant @xmath5 halo ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "technically , this reduces to the assumption that the total potential is the potential of the halo component only . even though it is a limiting case ,",
    "the study of _ halo  dominated _ models is interesting for several different reasons : 1 ) the formulae ",
    "expressible using elementary functions  are much simpler than in the general case , and can be studied very easily , making clearer the effect of the halo component on the df ; 2 ) the halo  dominated case is the one that differs most from the case of the corresponding one  component model , and so the differences are better evident ; 3 ) all the intermediate cases fall between the one  component model and the halo  dominated one .",
    "a comparison with more realistic values of the halo masses is postponed to section 5 .    in the following paragraphs",
    ", the two dfs will be compared with those of the corresponding one ",
    "component @xmath5 and @xmath6 models , and the exact phase  space constraints will be derived and compared with those obtained using the nc , wsc , and ssc in section 3 .",

    "we move now to comment on the main similarities and differences between the dfs of the two components of the ( 1,0 ) models , especially considering the role of concentration and orbital anisotropy in determining their consistency . for simplicity the discussion",
    "is restricted to the halo  dominated cases .",
    "the first important point addressed by using the dfs , is the study of the effect of halo concentration in determining the consistency of the two ( 1,0 ) model components in the case of _ global isotropy_. the effect of the @xmath6 halo concentration on the consistency of the globally isotropic @xmath5 component , can be derived by the direct inspection of the df and confirms the analytical prediction obtained using the wsc in  3.1 .",
    "in fact , it is found that the globally isotropic @xmath5 component is consistent independent of the concentration and total mass of the superimposed @xmath6 halo : _ only anisotropic _",
    "@xmath5 component in ( 1,0 ) models can be unphysical due to the presence of the @xmath6 density distribution .    for the globally isotropic @xmath6 component with a dominant @xmath5 halo , the situation is more complicate , because , in accordance with the analysis presented in  3.2 , its df may become negative in case of a high concentration of the external @xmath5 component . in fact , the df becomes negative for @xmath183 when @xmath184 , a larger value than the more conservative one ( 5/2 ) derived using the wsc",
    ". a closer look at this behavior , and a comparison with the qualitatively different behavior exhibited by the df of the @xmath5 component , is particularly instructive .",
    "in fact , while the df of the @xmath5 density distribution diverges at high ( relative ) energies both in the one  component and in the halo  dominated cases ( fig . 2 ) , the df of the @xmath6 model is divergent for high energies in the one  component case , but _",
    "finite _ in the halo  dominated one ( fig .",
    "3 ) . moreover , when increasing the @xmath5 halo concentration ( i.e. , increasing @xmath97 ) , the central value of the df associated with the @xmath6 density profile decreases monotonically , and , for @xmath109 greater than the before mentioned critical value , it becomes negative , revealing the model inconsistency . it must be stressed that a similar behavior was found in the numerical investigation of consistency of king ( 1972 ) and quasi ",
    "isothermal halos added to a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) density distribution , carried out by cp92 . also , note",
    "how the decrease of the central value of the df for increasing halo concentration is reminiscent of that found by c96 for ( 1,1 ) models , even if in that case the transition was found to be more discontinuous : the df of a @xmath5 component in ( 1,1 ) models remains divergent at the center for all finite concentrations of the other @xmath5 component , and becomes exactly zero at the center only when the halo is reduced to a central bh ( see fig . 2 in c96 ) .",
    "the qualitative discussion above can be put on more quantitative grounds .",
    "in fact , in the halo  dominated case , the central value of the df of the @xmath6 component is easily derived for a generic @xmath109 using the formulae given in  4.2 :",
    "@xmath185 and @xmath186 the limiting value for @xmath109 in the isotropic case is obtained by solving numerically the equation @xmath187 for @xmath188 . in fig .",
    "4 ( where the high  concentration case corresponding to @xmath188 is shown ) , the decrease of @xmath189 when @xmath109 increases is apparent .",
    "the second important point addressed by using the dfs , is the study of the _ combined _ effect of orbital anisotropy and halo concentration in determining the consistency of the two ( 1,0 ) model components .",
    "we can not expect a simple behavior , because  as should be clear from the previous sections ",
    "halo concentration and anisotropy affect the df in _ different _ regions of the phase  space , i.e. , the high energy regions of the df are more sensitive to concentration effects , while the om orbital anisotropy acts mainly at intermediate energies .",
    "the simplest way to summarize the results is to express the consistency limitations in terms of the anisotropy radius of each component as function of @xmath109 , determining in the parameter space @xmath190 the critical regions where the models are consistent .",
    "this approach is particularly useful because independent of the specific form of the density profile of the investigated model , the positivity requirement for each df of an om multi  component system over all the phase  space can be expressed in term of the anisotropy radius as a function of the other model parameters , due to the simple appearance of @xmath79 in equation ( 20 ) .",
    "in fact , let be @xmath191 the set defined by the property that @xmath192 @xmath193 .",
    "then , from equation ( 20 ) , @xmath194_{\\nu\\in a_+}\\right\\}},\\ ] ] is a first condition to be satisfied . obviously , when @xmath192 over all the phase  space ( the common situation ) , @xmath191 coincides with the total range of variation for @xmath121 , and equation ( 38 ) is also the _ only _ condition to be checked for the model consistency . in this case equation ( 38 ) shows that there is _ at most _ a lower bound for the anisotropy radius , @xmath195 .",
    "for example , this is the case for the @xmath5 component in ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) models , or for one  component anisotropic @xmath3 models .",
    "when the set @xmath196 ( complementary to @xmath191 ) is not empty , i.e. , @xmath197 over some region of phase  space , a second inequality , derived from equation ( 20 ) , must necessarily be verified : @xmath198_{\\nu\\in a_-}}.\\ ] ] a general consequence of equations ( 38)-(39 ) valid for _ all _ single or multi  component spherically symmetric , radially anisotropic om models , is that the allowed region for consistency in the anisotropy space is given by @xmath199 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath200 @xmath201 , or @xmath202 , then the proposed model is inconsistent .",
    "the quantitative trend of @xmath195 for the @xmath5 density distribution with a dominant @xmath6 halo is shown in fig .",
    "5a ( solid line ) : for a given @xmath109 all values of @xmath79 higher than the critical curve are acceptable .",
    "note how an increase in the halo concentration ( a decreasing @xmath109 ) produces an increase of @xmath195 , i.e. , a very concentrated halo makes the other component more sensitive to anisotropy effects , a behavior qualitatively anticipated in  4.1 , and already found for ( 1,1 ) models ( c96 , fig .",
    "5 ) .    a more complicated ( and more interesting ) case is presented by the halo  dominated @xmath6 model . in this case",
    "we already know that , due to the halo concentration , even the isotropic case can be inconsistent , i.e. , @xmath203 .",
    "this means that @xmath204 must also be considered .",
    "the trend of @xmath195 is shown in fig .",
    "5ab ( dotted line ) : as in the previous case an increase of the minimum anisotropy radius corresponds to an increasing halo concentration ( i.e. , to an increasing @xmath109 ) .",
    "as @xmath109 increases above the critical value @xmath205 , @xmath206 becomes negative at the center , and the isotropic @xmath6 component becomes inconsistent : in fig .",
    "5a this region is contained in the box at the top ",
    "right , that is enlarged in fig . 5b . here",
    "the dotted line is again @xmath195 , and the dashed line represents @xmath204 : for @xmath207 the inequality @xmath208 holds , and according to equations ( 38)-(39 ) the region between the two curves corresponds to consistent @xmath6 components .",
    "this is a quite counterintuitive example of the combined effect of an external potential and anisotropy on the consistency of an anisotropic galaxy model , where an otherwise inconsistent isotropic model is made consistent by orbital anisotropy ! finally , for @xmath209 no physically acceptable @xmath6 components are possible , even considering the effect of anisotropy .",
    "a question arises : how well does the asymptotic analysis obtained in the limit of dominant halos compare to the more realistic cases of halos with finite mass ?",
    "an answer can be obtained by inspection of fig .",
    "5a , where the dashed lines represent the limits on the anisotropy radius obtained when considering a halo ten times as massive as the component investigated .",
    "note that when the halo is _ more concentrated _ than the considered density component [ large @xmath109 in case of @xmath6 model ( dotted line ) and small @xmath109 for the @xmath5 model ( solid line ) ] , the curves corresponding to the asymptotic analysis and the dashed ones are indistinguishable for any practical application . on the contrary ,",
    "a small departure appears when the halo scale  length is substantially larger than that of the considered density component , with the dashed curves approaching the critical value for the anisotropy radius corresponding to the one  component model ( the two black dots ) .",
    "this is an obvious behavior , since for any _ finite _ value of the halo mass , its gravitational effect becomes weaker and weaker for larger and larger halo scale  length .",
    "in this paper , an extensive analytical investigation of the phase  space of two  component spherical galaxy models made of the sum of a hernquist density distribution and a @xmath6 model with different physical scales , is carried out . following the simple osipkov ",
    "merritt parameterization , a variable amount of orbital anisotropy is allowed in each component . for these models ,",
    "other important properties useful in applications  the velocity dispersion components and the various energy terms entering the scalar virial theorem  can be expressed analytically , and are given in appendix c. the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   the necessary and sufficient conditions that the model parameters must satisfy , in order to correspond to a ( 1,0 ) system for which the two physically distinct components have a positive df",
    "are analytically derived using the method introduced in cp92 .",
    "some conditions are obtained for the wider class of two ",
    "component @xmath2 models [ of which the ( 1,0 ) models are a special case ] .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the df of the @xmath0 component in isotropic @xmath2 models is nowhere negative , independent of the mass and concentration of the @xmath1 component , whenever @xmath210 and @xmath211 . as a special application of this result",
    ", it follows that a bh of any mass can be consistently added at the center of any isotropic member of the @xmath3 family of models , when @xmath103 .",
    "two important consequences follow .",
    "the first is that the consistency of isotropic ( 1,1 ) [ or ( 1,bh ) ] models proved in c96 using an `` ad hoc '' technique is not exceptional , but a common property of a large class of two ",
    "component @xmath3 models : for example , also isotropic two  component jaffe ( @xmath44 ) or jaffe+bh models can be safely assembled .",
    "the second is that in two  component isotropic models , the component with the steeper central density distribution is usually the most robust against inconsistency .",
    "2 .   it is shown that an analytic estimate of a minimum value of @xmath79 for one  component @xmath3 models with a massive ( dominant ) bh at their center can be explicitly found .",
    "as expected , this minimum value decreases for increasing @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that the analytic expression for the df of ( 1,0 ) models with general om anisotropy can be found in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the special cases in which each one of the two density components are embedded in a dominant halo are also discussed : under this assumption the dfs can be expressed using just elementary functions , allowing a detailed analytical investigation .",
    "the region of the parameter space in which ( 1,0 ) models are consistent is explored using the derived dfs : it is shown that , unlike the @xmath5 component , the @xmath6 component becomes inconsistent when the halo is sufficiently concentrated , even in the isotropic case .",
    "this is an explicit example ( albeit not so extreme ) of the result found by cp92 , that numerically proved the impossibility of adding a king or a quasi  isothermal halo to a de vaucouleurs galaxy . in such models , the ( isotropic )",
    "de vaucouleurs galaxy was found instead consistent over all the parameter space .",
    "the combined effect of halo concentration and orbital anisotropy is finally investigated .",
    "the trend of the minimum value for the anisotropy radius as a function of the halo concentration is qualitatively similar in both components , and to that found for ( 1,1 ) models in c96 : a more diffuse halo allows a larger amount of anisotropy .",
    "a qualitatively new behavior is found and explained by investigating the df of the @xmath6 component in the halo  dominated case for high halo concentrations .",
    "it is analytically shown that there exists a small region in the parameter space where a sufficient amount of _ anisotropy _ can compensate the inconsistency produced by the halo concentration on the structurally analogous  but isotropic  case .    as a final remark",
    ", it can be useful to point out some general trends that emerge when comparing different one and two  component models with om anisotropy , as those investigated numerically in cp92 and cl97 , and analytically in c96 and in this paper .",
    "the first common trend is that om anisotropy produces a negative df outside the galaxy center , while the halo concentration affects mainly the df at high ( relative ) energies .",
    "the second is that the possibility of sustaining a strong degree of anisotropy is weakened by the presence of a very concentrated halo .",
    "the third is that in two  component models , in cases of very different density profiles in the central regions , the component with the flatter density is the most `` delicate '' and can easily found to be inconsistent : particular attention should be paid in constructing such models .",

    "<S> in the context of the study of the properties of the mutual mass distribution of the bright and dark matter in elliptical galaxies , i present a family of two  component , spherical , self  consistent galaxy models , where one density distribution follows a @xmath0 profile , and the other a @xmath1 profile [ hereafter @xmath2 models ] , with different total masses and `` core '' radii . a variable amount of ( radial ) orbital anisotropy is allowed in both components , following the osipkov  merritt parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> for these models , i derive analytically the necessary and sufficient conditions that the model parameters must satisfy in order to correspond to a physical system ( the so  called model consistency ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the possibility of adding a black hole at the center of radially anisotropic @xmath3 models is discussed , determining analytically a lower limit of the anisotropy radius as a function of @xmath3 . the analytical phase </S>",
    "<S>  space distribution function for @xmath4 models is presented , together with the solution of the jeans equations and the quantities entering the scalar virial theorem . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that a globally isotropic @xmath5 component is consistent for any mass and core radius of the superimposed @xmath6 model ; on the contrary , only a maximum value of the core radius is allowed for the @xmath6 model when a @xmath5 density distribution is added . </S>",
    "<S> the combined effects of mass concentration and orbital anisotropy are investigated , and an interesting behavior of the distribution function of the anisotropic @xmath6 component is found : there exists a region in the parameter space where a sufficient amount of anisotropy results in a consistent model , while the structurally identical but isotropic model would be inconsistent .     = 11 versim#1#22.9truept  = 12 </S>"
