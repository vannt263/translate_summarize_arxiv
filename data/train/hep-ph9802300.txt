    "in this article we study long - distance contributions to the @xmath7 decay amplitudes using the @xmath3 expansion ( @xmath8 being the number of colors ) within the framework of the chiral effective lagrangian for pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the calculation of chiral loop effects motivated by the @xmath3 expansion was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the @xmath9 selection rule .",
    "these articles considered loop corrections to the current@xmath10current operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the gluon penguin operator @xmath1 was included at the tree level , consistent with the @xmath3 expansion since the short - distance ( wilson ) coefficient is subleading in @xmath8 . following the same lines of thought the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite performed a detailed analysis of the ratio @xmath13 , which measures the direct @xmath14 violation in @xmath15 decays .",
    "they included the matrix elements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the tree level in the @xmath3 expansion , arguing that their quadratic dependence on the running mass @xmath16 cancels , in the large-@xmath8 limit , the evolution of the coefficient functions in the absence of chiral loops .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath9 rule , which is governed by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath17 is dominated by the density@xmath10density operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 . therefore it is important to investigate the @xmath3 corrections to the matrix elements of the last two operators . in particular",
    ", it must be examined whether the @xmath3 corrections significantly affect the large cancellation between the gluon and the electroweak penguin contributions obtained at the tree level in ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the analysis of @xmath17 was extended by incorporating in part chiral loops for the density@xmath10density operators , i.e. , @xmath3 corrections to the matrix elements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the final result was an enhancement of @xmath18 and a decrease for @xmath19 , which introduces a smaller cancellation between these two operators .",
    "as a consequence , the authors found a large positive value for @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a new analysis of the hadronic matrix elements of the gluon and the electroweak penguin operators in which we include , in the isospin limit , the first order corrections in the twofold expansion in powers of external momenta , @xmath20 , and the ratio @xmath3 , i.e. , we present a complete investigation of the matrix elements up to the orders @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "matrix elements will be presented elsewhere .",
    "] one improvement concerns the matching of short- and long - distance contributions to the decay amplitudes , by adopting a modified identification of virtual momenta in the integrals of the chiral loops . to be explicit",
    ", we consider the two densities in density@xmath10density operators to be connected to each other through the exchange of an effective color singlet boson , and identify its momentum with the loop integration variable .",
    "the effect of this procedure is to modify the loop integrals , which introduces noticeable effects in the final results . more important",
    "it provides an unambiguous matching of the @xmath3 expansion in terms of mesons to the qcd expansion in terms of quarks and gluons .",
    "the approach followed here leads to an explicit classification of the diagrams into factorizable and non - factorizable .",
    "factorizable loop diagrams refer to the strong sector of the theory and give corrections whose scale dependence is absorbed in the renormalization of the chiral effective lagrangian .",
    "the non - factorizable loop diagrams have to be matched to the wilson coefficients and should cancel scale dependences which arise from the short - distance expansion .",
    "the disentanglement of factorizable and non - factorizable contributions is especially important for the calculation of the @xmath23 matrix elements of @xmath1 : although the @xmath4 term vanishes for @xmath1 , the non - factorizable loop corrections to this term remain and have to be matched to the short - distance part of the amplitudes .",
    "these @xmath23 non - factorizable corrections must be considered at the same level , in the twofold expansion , as the @xmath24 tree contribution and have not previously been calculated .",
    "the same procedure is followed for investigating the matrix elements of @xmath2 . as a final result , we present the numerical values for the matrix elements @xmath25 and @xmath26 to orders @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "another improvement is the enlargement of the lagrangian , that is to say , we use the complete chiral effective lagrangian up to @xmath27 . finally , we include effects of the singlet @xmath28 , which is necessary for the investigation of isospin breaking terms .",
    "the latter generate the matrix element @xmath29 which is important for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "isospin violating terms will be studied in the future . for consistency , and to introduce the general lines of thought , we include here the @xmath28 also for the computation of the matrix elements @xmath25 and @xmath30 in the isospin limit , where its effect is expected to be small .",
    "this paper includes several improvements which are necessary for a complete calculation to orders @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as was defined above .",
    "it is still necessary to include these improvements for the isospin violating terms , but this will not affect the results for @xmath25 and @xmath30 presented here . furthermore , we can contemplate still higher order corrections which , at present , are beyond the scope of this analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ gf ] we review the general framework of the effective low - energy calculation . in section [ ma ] we discuss the matching of short- and long - distance contributions to the decay amplitudes .",
    "then , in section [ fac ] we investigate the factorizable @xmath3 corrections to the hadronic matrix elements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where we show explicitly that the scale dependence resulting from the chiral loop corrections is absorbed in the renormalization of the bare couplings , the mesonic wave functions and masses .",
    "this we do on the particle level , as well as , on the level of the operator evolution for which we apply the background field method . in section [ nfac ] we calculate the non - factorizable loop corrections to the hadronic matrix elements and the corresponding non - factorizable evolution of the density@xmath10density operators . in section [ num ]",
    "we give the numerical values for the matrix elements and the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the latter quantify the deviation of the matrix elements from those obtained in the vacuum saturation approximation .",
    "finally , we summarize and compare our results with those of the existing analyses .",
    "within the standard model the calculation of the @xmath15 decay amplitudes is based on the effective low - energy hamiltonian for @xmath31 transitions @xcite , @xmath32 @xmath33 where the wilson coefficient functions @xmath34 of the local four - fermion operators @xmath35 are obtained by means of the renormalization group equation .",
    "they were computed in an extensive next - to - leading logarithm analysis by two groups @xcite .",
    "long - distance contributions to the isospin amplitudes @xmath36 are contained in the hadronic matrix elements of the bosonized operators , @xmath37 which are related to the @xmath38 and @xmath39 final states through the isospin decomposition latexmath:[\\ ] ] with @xmath219 being reduced to @xmath220 .    through analytic continuation , eqs .",
    "( [ i8a ] ) and ( [ i8b ] ) provide complex solutions .",
    "these appear for @xmath221 . in the process under consideration",
    ", the latter relation can only be satisfied for @xmath222 , @xmath223 .",
    "thus our analysis gives the physical threshold condition for @xmath224 rescattering , the imaginary part of @xmath204 being attributed to the strong final state interaction phase .",
