    "most machine learning systems operate in batch mode .",
    "they analyze a set of historical data and then develop a model that reflects the world as it was when the model was formed . but the world is dynamic , and the complex distributions that a model models are likely to be non - stationary and thus to change over time , leading to deteriorating model performance . to address this problem",
    "it is necessary to develop mechanisms for detecting and handling concept drift . to this end",
    "there has been much work on identifying types of concept drift @xcite .",
    "while many types have been identified , most definitions have been qualitative , many of the definitions have been informal and despite efforts to introduce standardization @xcite , the terminology has been non - uniform and inconsistently applied .",
    "we argue that quantitative measures of concept drift are essential for the development of a detailed understanding of the problems confronted by attempts to detect and address non - stationary distributions , and to assess the relative capacity of techniques that may be proposed .",
    "one example is the term _",
    "gradual drift_. @xcite and @xcite define gradual drift as a transition between two concepts in a progression from the first concept being present with 100% probability , through various states in which one or the other is present with varying probabilities , to a concluding state in which the second concept is present with 100% probability . in  contrast , @xcite define it as a period where two concepts are both present ; @xcite , suggest that it may not be possible to distinguish gradual drift from a sequence of abrupt drifts ; and @xcite define it as a gradual change of concept boundaries . to add to the confusion , @xcite and @xcite use differing diagrams as the primary expression of their definitions , which are open to different interpretations .",
    "further , @xcite and @xcite assume discrete time , while @xcite and @xcite do not .",
    "these previous definitions are not sufficiently precise to be able to specify which of the types of change in class probability depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gradinc ] should be considered gradual .",
    "must gradual drift be a steady progression from one concept to another , as illustrated in the top - left , or can the rate vary ( top - center ) or even the direction ( top - right ) ?",
    "can a gradual drift overshoot the final concept ( bottom - left ) ?",
    "what are the limits on the rate of drift that can be considered gradual ( bottom center ) ? can gradual drift oscillate between two concepts before settling on the final state ( bottom - right ) ?",
    "if current definitions can not answer these questions then they are clearly not very precise .",
    "another example of inconsistent terminology is the distinction between _ real _ and _ virtual concept drift_. @xcite define the former as drift in the distribution generating the data and the latter as something that `` does not occur in reality but , rather , in the computer model reflecting this reality . ''",
    "in contrast , @xcite and @xcite define virtual concept drift as drift in the non - class variables .",
    "additionally , @xcite and @xcite use the terms _ covariate shift _ and _ prior probability shift _ for what the latter three call _ real _ and _ virtual concept drift _ , respectively .",
    "we propose some core quantitative measures and provide a framework for developing further such measures .",
    "this framework also provides the foundation for formal definitions of qualitative categorizations of types of drift .",
    "we exploit this to develop precise formal definitions for the key types of concept drift previously mentioned in the literature and provide a comprehensive taxonomy thereof .",
    "our formal definitions allow some of the controversies in the field to be resolved , such as whether the distinction between incremental and gradual drift is meaningful and if so exactly how the two categories of drift relate to one another .    0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3     0.3     = .75    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     these results are initially quite startling , as it might be expected that a tree based classifier after seeing 100,000 examples would have learned a tree with a leaf for every one of the @xmath0 combination of covariate values . indeed , in practice",
    "slightly fewer than this number of leaves should be required , as , by chance , all the leaves below a small number of potential branches should be mapped to the same class and hence the branch should not be included in the tree .",
    "however , the tree learners are clearly not learning a complete tree , as if they had , error would be zero .",
    "this is because some of the combinations of covariate values are , by chance , substantially less frequent than others , and the tree learners fail to detect the value of splitting on them .    the larger the magnitude of a pure covariate drift , the greater the probability that a combination of covariate values that was infrequent prior to the drift will become substantially more frequent after the drift .",
    "the more frequent a combination becomes , the faster the learner will recognize the value of a split to distinguish it .",
    "to further investigate this phenomenon , we repeated the experiment for the most classic of the tree based learners , the hoeffding tree , but continued learning until @xmath1 ( continue learning up to 10 times the number of instances presented before the drift ) .",
    "we show the resulting curve in fig .",
    "[ subfig : zoomed - error ] , using log scale to make clear the consistent but small differences at @xmath1 .",
    "note that the apparent high - variance at the end is only due to the log - scale .",
    "y - axis is displayed in log - scale .",
    "error for different magnitude of drift .",
    "win - draw - loss comparing data streams with no drift to data streams with drift of magnitude 0.7,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to get sufficient resolution to clearly show the differences in error , the experiment was repeated for 1,000 different randomly generated streams .",
    "the results show that even 1,000,000 examples after the pure covariate drift , the larger the magnitude of the drift , the lower the eventual error of the hoeffding tree .",
    "the plots of mean error do not reveal how consistent is this advantage to larger magnitudes of drift . to provide an indication of this ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ subfig : zoomed - wdl ] the win - draw - loss for the setting with no drift ( magnitude=0.0 ) against the setting with a drift of magnitude=0.7 . the wins for",
    "no drift represent the number of data stream pairs for which the error for no drift ( averaged over 1,000 successive time steps for the sake of precision ) is lower than the error for magnitude=0.7 .",
    "each data stream - pair includes one data stream generated from the randomly created initial concept ( the magnitude=0.0 stream ) and a second stream that starts with the first 100,000 instances from the first stream but then is generated from a randomly formed concept at a hellinger distance of 0.7 from the initial concept ( the magnitude=0.7 stream ) . the wins for magnitude=0.7 represent the number of data stream pairs for which its error is lower , and # draws indicates the number of stream pairs for which the errors are identical .",
    "[ subfig : zoomed - wdl ] shows that shortly after the drift , in fact from @xmath2 , the error for magnitude=0.7 is lower more often than is the error for no drift .",
    "even 1,000,000 time steps after the drift , where the methods seem to be the closest to each other , the error of no drift is lower for only 75 streams , while magnitude=0.7 has lower error for 126 streams .",
    "we conducted a one - tailed binomial sign test of significance ( null hypothesis : when there is not a draw , no drift is as likely or more likely to achieve lower error ; alternative hypothesis : when there is not a draw , magnitude=0.7 is more likely to achieve lower error ) with the result @xmath3 , which is highly significant at the 0.01 level .",
    "these experimental results should only be regarded as preliminary .",
    "they only show the response of each learner in the context of one specific type of pre and post abrupt drift concept . apart from the startling result of covariate drift improving the accuracy of tree based learners",
    ", no attempt has been made to understand why the different mechanisms respond as they do .",
    "there is clearly much work to be done to develop a comprehensive understanding of how different drift detection and remediation mechanisms perform in the context of different forms of drift .",
    "however , these simple experiments with different magnitudes and types of abrupt drift and their results provide compelling evidence of the importance of quantitative characterizations of drift for understanding the relative response of different drift detection and remediation mechanisms to different forms of drift , for designing effective drift detection and remediation mechanisms , and ultimately for developing a solid theoretical understanding of learning in the context of concept drift . without the notion of drift magnitude and the theoretical tools to measure and manipulate it",
    ", it would not be possible to derive the insight that the greater the magnitude of pure covariate drift the faster a hoeffding tree recovers and the lower the final error attained .",
    "having established the importance of quantitative characterizations of drift , we now explore some of the implications of our new conceptual analysis .",
    "many of the qualitative definitions rely on user defined thresholds @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as a result , these definitions are inherently subjective .",
    "while this may seem a limitation of our formal definitions for existing qualitative characterizations of concept drift , we believe it is actually a useful contribution to make explicit which aspects of these characterizations are subjective .    our analysis has made explicit the subjective nature of many of the core concept drift types that have been previously proposed . rather than relying on these subjective qualitative descriptions",
    ", we suggest that it is better to use the new objective quantitative measures that we have defined .",
    "these include cycle duration and drift rate , magnitude , frequency , duration and path length .",
    "it is not clear to what extent it might be feasible to use our definitions to directly quantify real - world cases of concept drift , as it will often not be feasible to accurately estimate the relevant probability distributions at each point in time .",
    "nonetheless , they are likely to be useful in helping the design of drift detection systems @xcite , as they provide clear guidance about the ways in which drift may occur .",
    "further , the measures that we define may provide useful idealizations to guide the development of approximations that are feasible to assess from data .",
    "this is another promising direction for follow - up research .",
    "our definitions should play an important role in informing the design of online learning algorithms . by improving understanding of the drift mechanisms that a learner may confront ,",
    "our definitions have the potential to assist the design of more robust and effective online learning systems .    additionally ,",
    "by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of types of drift and measures for exactly quantifying them , our conceptual analysis should assist the design of more thorough experimental evaluations of the relative capacities of different learners to respond to different forms of drift .",
    "for example , synthetic data streams are frequently used to assess relative performance of different algorithms under various possible drift types @xcite .",
    "our taxonomy and definitions of drift types provide comprehensive and structured guidance for the design of synthetic data stream experiments .",
    "they make explicit the different types of drift that may affect algorithm performance .",
    "further , they should play an important role in improving the analysis of experimental performance .",
    "they provide a comprehensive set of formal definitions and the first set of quantitative measures of different types of drift . as a result , they supply a framework for more objective evaluation of stream mining algorithms and their relative capacities to respond to different drift scenarios .",
    "while only a few of the types of drift that we have defined are inherently predictable ( see section  [ sec : predictability ] ) , there may be other types of factors that make some aspects of drift predictable .",
    "for example , in some applications it may be possible to detect triggers for different types of drift . here our definitions will provide a useful framework for characterizing and exploiting the predictable elements of the drift .",
    "our formal qualitative definitions of types of drift are based on the model of a stream as comprising periods of concept stability interspersed by periods of drift .",
    "this model appears to be implicit in many previous characterizations of types of concept drift .",
    "this is a questionable assumption for many streams and one which would be an interesting subject for empirical study .",
    "this research began as an exercise in developing formal definitions for existing qualitative descriptions of concept drift .",
    "this revealed several shortcomings of qualitative descriptions of drift :    * that they require subjective thresholds  the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in our definitions ; * that they appear to rely on an implicit assumption that drift occurs between periods without drift ; and * that they can not provide fine - grained discrimination between different drifts of the same general types .",
    "these factors highlight the need for quantitative measures of drift . to this end",
    "we have defined the key measures drift magnitude and duration , from which it is possible to derive further measures , such as rate and path length .",
    "we anticipate that defining quantitative measures for characterizing concept drift and resolving the ambiguities and imprecision of past qualitative definitions will help :    * standardize the terminology used in the literature ; * provide a rigorous theoretical basis for designing new mechanisms to detect , characterize and resolve concept drift ; * understand what forms of drift are best handled by each different mechanism for handling drift ; * create greater diversity in the types of drift that are created by synthetic drift data generators @xcite for stream mining evaluation ; * develop more comprehensive and objective approaches for evaluating stream mining algorithms ; and * design new machine learning techniques that are robust to a greater diversity of drift types .",
