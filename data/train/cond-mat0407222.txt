    "the adsorption of water on metal surfaces has been extensively studied for many years due to its technological importance and wide academic interest.@xcite in recent years , there have even been some new experiments on water enhanced surface reactions of environmental importance.@xcite one of the central issues is the microscopic understanding of the bonding and orientation characteristics of water molecules on the surfaces . while experimental and theoretical investigations have provided unified information about the bonding structure for most water - adsorbed metal surfaces , theoretical results are not always in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "one example is the water - adsorbed cu(100 ) surface.@xcite    copper is an important material for structural , electrical , and electronics applications .",
    "corrosion of copper , which is a source of significant economic losses and occurs both in aqueous environments@xcite and atmospheric air,@xcite depends intimately on water adsorption .",
    "adsorption of water on copper is therefore important , both from technological and basic scientific points of view .",
    "the experimental investigations for the adsorption of water on cu(100 ) have been done with various techniques including ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) , auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , electron - energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) , and low - energy electron diffraction ( leed).@xcite water has been found to adsorb molecularly on the surface at low temperatures ( @xmath2  k ) and to tend to form clusters .",
    "temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) measurements have shown that the desorption of water from the surface occurs at a temperature of @xmath3160 - 170  k.@xcite the eels data of anderson _",
    "_ suggested that the water molecule is bonded at the one - fold on - top ( @xmath1 ) site with its oxygen end towards the surface and its axis tilted away from the surface normal ( at an estimated angle of about @xmath4).@xcite    several groups have performed theoretical calculations for the water - adsorbed cu ( 100 ) surface using cluster models.@xcite while these investigations have provided useful insight about the interaction between water and the surface , some of the key results are not in agreement with the experimental data . for example , while _ ab initio _ density - functional cluster calculations showed that the configuration with a tilted water molecule at the @xmath1 site on cu(100 ) would be more stable than that with the axis of the water molecule parallel to the surface normal,@xcite they predicted that the @xmath1 site would not be the energetically most favorable bonding site .",
    "instead , the calculations showed that water would prefer to bond at the two - fold bridge ( @xmath5 ) site with its molecular axis parallel to the surface normal.@xcite similarly , semi - empirical quantum chemical cluster calculations concluded that the adsorption of a water molecule at a four - fold hollow site ( @xmath6 ) would be energetically most favorable.@xcite both results disagree with the experimental data , which suggest a tilted geometry of water at the @xmath1 site on cu(100 ) .    here",
    "we present results of total - energy density - functional calculations in which supercell models are used to simulate the cu(100 ) surface .",
    "the atomic and electronic structures of the adsorbed surface , as well as the preferred bonding site and orientation of water molecules , are determined . in agreement with the experimental data , the most stable adsorption site for water molecules chemisorbed on the cu(100 ) surface",
    "is determined to be the on - top @xmath1 site , and a tilted geometry of water at the on - top site with an angle of approximately @xmath7 away from the surface normal is shown to be energetically favorable . moreover",
    ", rotational diffusion of the water axis around the surface normal is predicted to dominate over lateral diffusion at low temperatures .",
    "in addition , the energetics of molecularly adsorbed water on the cu(100 ) surface suggests a tendency for the formation of water clusters on the surface .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii we present and discuss our theoretical results . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize the main conclusions obtained from our calculations .",
    "on the ( 100 ) surface of an f.c.c .",
    "metal , there are three different symmetric adsorption sites , known as four - fold hollow ( @xmath6 ) , two - fold bridge ( @xmath5 ) , and one - fold on - top ( @xmath1 ) sites.@xcite we studied the adsorption of water at each of the three bonding sites on cu(100 ) , and we also investigated the orientation of the water molecule on the surface .",
    "the cu(100 ) surface was modeled by repeated slabs with seven copper layers separated by a vacuum region equivalent to nine copper layers .",
    "each metal layer in the supercell contained nine cu atoms ( a @xmath8 surface unit cell ) .",
    "water was adsorbed symmetrically on both sides of the slab .",
    "all the cu atoms were initially located at their bulk positions , with the equilibrium lattice constant of the bulk determined by our calculations .",
    "calculations with a larger supercell containing nine copper layers showed that convergence of the binding energy of a water molecule on the cu(100 ) surface for the most stable configuration with respect to the thickness of the slab was to be within 0.02  ev .",
    "the calculations were performed within density - functional theory , using the pseudopotential method and a plane - wave basis set.@xcite the results reported in this paper were obtained using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the exchange - correlation effects were treated with the generalized gradient - corrected exchange - correlation functionals ( gga ) given by perdew and wang.@xcite we adopted the vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentials supplied by kresse and hafner.@xcite a plane - wave energy cutoff of 30  ry and 10 special * k * points in the irreducible part of the two - dimensional brillouin zone of the @xmath8 surface cell were used for calculating the h@xmath0o - adsorbed cu ( 100 ) surface .",
    "test calculations with cutoff energies up to 35  ry and with different numbers of special * k * points ( 6 and 10 points ) obtained the binding energy of a water molecule on the cu(100 ) surface for the most stable configuration within 0.01  ev .",
    "optimization of the atomic structure was performed for each supercell _ via _ a conjugate - gradient technique using the total energy and the hellmann - feynman forces on the atoms.@xcite all the structures were fully relaxed until the forces on all the atoms were less than 0.03  ev /  . in this sense , the o - h bond length and the h - o - h angle of the h@xmath0o molecule were optimized .",
    "we first present the calculated properties for bulk copper and the relaxed clean cu(100 ) surface .",
    "calculations for bulk cu were conducted with 408 special * k * points and a cutoff energy of 30  ry . the total energy convergence with respect to the cutoff energy ( 25 - 40  ry ) and the number of the * k * points ( 220 - 570 ) was within a few tenths of 1  mev per atom .",
    "we obtained lattice constants of 3.64   for bulk cu , in good agreement with the experimental value of 3.61  .@xcite    .relaxation of the clean cu(100 ) surface .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      configuration on the cu(100 ) surface .",
    "note that the o - cu connecting line is slightly off ( by approximately 0.03   ) the rotation axis and rotates around it . ]    previous theoretical studies employing cluster models also determined the preferred bonding sites of water on the cu(100 ) surface , as mentioned in sec .",
    "i. _ ab initio _ dft calculations using a 13-atom cluster for the cu(100 ) surface showed that water would prefer to bond at the @xmath5 site with its molecular axis normal to the surface.@xcite semi - empirical quantum chemical cluster calculations with a 9-atom cluster predicted that the binding energy of a water molecule at the @xmath6 site was significantly larger than at the @xmath1 site ( by approximately",
    "@xmath11  ev).@xcite these theoretical conclusions are inconsistent with both our _ ab initio _ supercell calculations and the experimental data .",
    "the main problem is that the previous calculations were limited to small clusters , containing only up to 13 metal atoms .",
    "in contrast to semiconductors , metals are often poorly represented by small clusters .",
    "large clusters or extended surface models are usually needed to simulate real metal surfaces in order to achieve good convergence in calculations .",
    "the obtained structural parameters of the optimized geometry for the tilted-@xmath1 configuration show that the water molecule keeps essentially the same shape upon adsorption on the surface with the equilibrium o - h bond length ( 0.98   ) and h - o - h angle ( 105.6@xmath12 ) slightly larger than those of a free molecule : 0.97   and 105.3@xmath12 , respectively , determined from our calculations.@xcite the experimental values@xcite of the o - h bond length and h - o - h bond angle for an isolated water molecule are 0.96   and 104.5@xmath12 , respectively . after the adsorption of a water molecule , the surface cu atom that is bonded to oxygen",
    "is observed to shift its position up along the surface normal ( by 0.08   ) and also to have a slight in - plane shift of 0.02   along the direction against the h@xmath0o molecular axis .",
    "the distance between the oxygen and its bonded surface copper atom is 2.28   .",
    "the structural changes reflect the fact that there is a considerable ( though weak ) interaction between the adsorbed water molecule and the cu(100 ) surface .",
    "it is interesting to note that the variation of the total energies for the tilted-@xmath1 configurations with the rotation of the water molecule around the surface normal ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) was determined to be less than 0.02  ev .",
    "the activation energy for rotation is thus about 0.08  ev smaller than the lateral diffusion barrier for a water molecule on the cu(100 ) surface , which was estimated to be approximately 0.1  ev ( with @xmath1-@xmath5-@xmath1 taken as the diffusion pathway ) .",
    "while there so far have been no experimental efforts to observe such rotational diffusion , these energetic considerations suggest that it should occur at much lower temperatures than lateral diffusion .",
    "lateral diffusion at elevated temperatures has been experimentally observed for single water molecules initially adsorbed at low temperatures of about 20  k.@xcite the occurrence of the rotation of the water molecule around a stiff axis on the surface is a consequence of the fact that the bonding of water with the cu(100 ) surface is dominated by the oxygen lone - pair electronic orbital ( see below ) .",
    "reliable theoretical values for the water sublimation energy have been obtained with _ ab initio _",
    "dft calculations.@xcite hamann obtained a value of 0.66  ev for the h@xmath0o ice sublimation energy,@xcite while feibelman,@xcite using the same computation package ( vasp ) as we employed , obtained values of 0.67 - 0.72  ev for the d@xmath0o ice sublimation energy .",
    "our calculated binding energy ( 0.25  ev ) of h@xmath0o on cu(100 ) is thus significantly smaller than the water sublimation energy .",
    "therefore , water molecules apparently tend to form ice - like clusters on the cu(100 ) surface .",
    "this could occur even at low water coverages when high temperatures make the water molecules diffuse on the surface .",
    "experimental measurements have demonstrated that water clusters were indeed formed on the cu(100 ) surface.@xcite in particular , only one peak was observed at a temprature of approximately 160  k in the tpd spectrum of h@xmath0o on cu(100 ) , indistinguishable from the ice sublimation peak.@xcite        the calculated electronic density of states ( dos ) for the clean and the h@xmath0o - adsorbed cu(100 ) surfaces are shown in fig .",
    "the main changes of the dos upon the adsorption of water are found to be in the energy region lower than about 4  ev below the fermi level on the dos curve .",
    "two new peaks ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) , located at @xmath1310.07 and @xmath136.52  ev relative to the fermi level , respectively , are clearly observed .",
    "the curve for the projected density of states ( projected or local dos ) onto the water molecule ( fig .",
    "3(c ) ) indicates that these two peaks correspond to the water 1@xmath14 and 3@xmath15 states . the highest - energy electronic state of water ,",
    "that is , the 1@xmath16 molecular orbital , is buried in the substrate energy band and hardly observed in the total dos curve .",
    "however , the local dos curve shows that its peak is located at @xmath134.97  ev relative to the fermi level ( fig .",
    "upon adsorption , the 1@xmath16 and 3@xmath15 orbitals of the water molecule are observed to shift down in energy by 0.72  ev and 0.29  ev , respectively , while the 1@xmath14 orbital remains almost unchanged in energy level . the 1@xmath16 state is also seen to be more delocalized when water is adsorbed on the surface .",
    "these results suggest that water is bonded to the surface _ via _ the 1@xmath16 state ( with some contributions from the 3@xmath15 state ) .",
    "the 1@xmath16 state is primarily of oxygen 2@xmath17 lone - pair character , and a small charge transfer from water to the copper surface is thus mostly from the oxygen 2@xmath17 state ( water is known as a lewis base ) .",
    "such a charge transfer and the resulting bonding between the 1@xmath16 state and the surface would be facilitated when the 2@xmath17 orbital is perpendicular to the surface and toward a surface atom .",
    "therefore , a water molecule would prefer to bond _ via _ oxygen at the on - top @xmath1 site on the cu(100 ) surface .",
    "moreover , the molecular axis of water would be tilted away from the surface normal since the 1@xmath16 orbital and the o - h bonding orbitals in water tend to form a quasi - tetrahedral geometry . thus , the tilted-@xmath1 configuration represents the most stable structure for the water - adsorbed cu(100 ) surface .",
    "in addition , rotation of the water axis around the surface normal has essentially no effects on the bonding between the 1@xmath16 orbital and the surface , resulting in an very small energy cost for such a rotation .",
    "these qualitative conclusions , based on the dos and electronic structures , are in excellent agreement with the quantitative results of the energetics discussed above .",
    "the theoretical approach of supercell models combined with first - principles total - energy dft pseudopotential methods has reproduced experimental measurements of the preferred adsorption geometry for the water - adsorbed cu(100 ) surface .",
    "very small differences in total energies among configurations with different orientations and bonding sites of the water molecule have been distinguished .",
    "it is shown that the on - top @xmath1 configuration is the most stable structure for the h@xmath0o - adsorbed cu(100 ) surface , and the water molecule is shown to be tilted with its axis approximately @xmath7 away from the surface normal .",
    "the calculations also predict that rotational diffusion of the water axis around the surface normal would occur at low temperatures .",
    "in addition , water molecules are likely to form ice - like clusters on the cu(100 ) surface at high coverages or at high temperatures .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grants dmr-0111841 and dmr-0240078 and by the school of computational science and technology ( csit ) at florida state university .",
    "access to the csit sp3 and sp4 supercomputers is also acknowledged .",
    "the results for a water molecule before adsorption ( free h@xmath0o ) were obtained by employing a supercell with the same size as that for the h@xmath0o / cu(100 ) surface .",
    "test calculations showed that the supercell was sufficiently large to provide convergent data for a free h@xmath0o molecule ."
