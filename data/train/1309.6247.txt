    "relaxation takes place via `` excitations ''  @xcite ( or `` soft spots ''  @xcite ) that become increasing rare at low temperatures , slowing down the dynamics .",
    "alternatively , one may imagine that the system evolves on a rough potential energy surface , and tends to become trapped in deep minima as the temperature is lowered  @xcite . or perhaps , the diversity ( entropy ) of disordered states decreases so strongly at low temperatures that transitions between distinct states require large - scale rearrangements that are necessarily very slow  @xcite .    in order to refine these qualitative pictures , theoretical developments are complemented by computer simulations of glassy fluids . however , the practical task of identifying objects like `` excitations '' or `` free energy minima '' in simulation is a difficult one ( see however  @xcite ) .",
    "a particular case in point is the idea of _ metastable states_. it is very natural to describe glassy dynamics in terms of rare transitions between such states , which are are also well - defined in some classes of mean - field model  @xcite . in computer simulation ,",
    "identifying distinct metastable states is possible in small systems  @xcite , but the generalisation to extended ( large ) systems is more difficult ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this is an important obstacle when attempting to test theoretical pictures based on mean - field models .",
    "recently , kurchan and levine  @xcite proposed a _",
    "patch - repetition analysis _",
    "whereby metastable states may be identified and characterised , using computer simulations of large systems .",
    "the method has two main components : a time - averaging procedure that associates metastable states of lifetime @xmath0 with well - defined density profiles ; and a counting procedure based on finite ` patches ' of the large system .",
    "this work provides a method ( or thought - experiment ) by which metastable states may be defined in finite - dimensional systems .",
    "recent numerical studies based on this method  @xcite have focussed on the counting procedure , showing that this can indeed yield an entropy associated with the number of states in the system .    here",
    ", we apply the patch - repetition analysis to the east model  @xcite .",
    "this is a kinetically constrained model  @xcite whose thermodynamic properties ( and potential energy landscape ) are trivial , but whose dynamics are nevertheless complex , and have striking similarities with molecular glass - formers  @xcite .",
    "we find that the patch - repetition analysis can be used to identify and characterise metastable states in this model , despite its trivial potential energy surface .",
    "however , the metastable states that are revealed absolutely require the time - averaging process described in  @xcite : in particular , there are states with a very broad spectrum of lifetimes , and the results of the patch - repetition analysis depend on the lifetime of the states under analysis . in this sense , the patch - repetition analysis is distinct from recent studies that aim to characterise amorphous order through analyses where a system is constrained ( pinned ) or biased to remain close to a typical reference configuration  @xcite  these analyses are purely static and have no dependence on the dynamical rules by which the system evolves",

    "the east model  @xcite consists of @xmath1 binary spins @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , and periodic boundaries .",
    "we refer to spins with @xmath4 as ` up ' and those with @xmath5 as ` down ' .",
    "the notation @xmath6 indicates a configuration of the system .",
    "the key feature of the model is that spin @xmath7 may flip only if spin @xmath8 is up . if this _ kinetic constraint _",
    "@xcite is satisfied , spin @xmath7 flips from @xmath9 to @xmath10 with rate @xmath11 and from @xmath10 to @xmath9 with rate @xmath12 .",
    "we take @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the inverse temperature , so small @xmath11 corresponds to low temperature .",
    "the rates for spin flips obey detailed balance , so that the probability of configuration @xmath15 at equilibrium is simply @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the partition function . at equilibrium , one has @xmath18 , and the regime of interest is small @xmath11 ( low temperature ) .    despite the trivial form of @xmath19 , the kinetic constraint in this model leads to complex co - operative dynamics at small @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the relaxation time of the model diverges in a super - arrhenius fashion , as @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the rapid increase in relaxation time is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cor]a where we show @xmath21 for various temperatures .",
    "the origin of the increasing time scale is a large set of metastable states , arranged hierarchically  @xcite : different states have different lifetimes which scale as @xmath22 .",
    "here and throughout @xmath23 is an integer which we use to classify the various relevant time scales in the system .",
    "evidence for the separated timescales is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cor]b : the correlation function decays via a sequence of plateaus that become more clearly separated as @xmath11 is reduced .     in the east model .",
    "( a )  the inverse temperature is varied from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , showing a dramatic increase in relaxation time .",
    "( b )  at the lowest temperatures , plateaus are apparent during the early stages of relaxation ( where @xmath26 is large ) .",
    "arrows indicate the times for which data is shown in later figures .",
    "the behaviour at these times is representative of regimes @xmath27 : the rationale for choosing the specific values of @xmath28 is discussed in the main text.,width=302 ]      to identify metastable states , we perform a time average over the spins , defining @xmath29 and a time - averaged spin profile @xmath30",
    "the key observation of  @xcite is that if the system has metastable states indexed by @xmath31 , then each state is associated with a profile @xmath32 .",
    "further , if @xmath28 is much larger than the intrastate relaxation times , but small compared to their lifetimes , then the observed profile @xmath33 will almost surely be close to one of the @xmath32 .",
    "hence , the statistical properties of the ( observable ) profiles @xmath33 can be used to infer the properties of the metastable states in the system .",
    "this situation , of many metastable states each associated with a profile @xmath32 , holds very accurately in the east model . as discussed by sollich and evans  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , motion on a time scale @xmath34 is restricted to domains of size @xmath35 , with each domain being immediately to the right of a long - lived up spin .",
    "also , if @xmath27 then spins within such domains typically flip many times within time @xmath28 , while other spins are unlikely to flip at all .",
    "the result of this large number of flips is that @xmath36 if spin @xmath7 is within a mobile domain .",
    "sollich and evans  @xcite used the term `` superdomain '' to describe these mobile domains . a metastable state with lifetime of order @xmath22 can be identified by specifying the position of its superdomains .    in terms of fig .",
    "[ fig : cor]b , the limit @xmath27 corresponds to choosing a time within a plateau of the correlation function .",
    "however , when using numerical results to gain information about metastable states , we find that saturating the limit @xmath37 is more important than @xmath38 : in the following we focus on the time points indicated by arrows in fig .  [",
    "fig : cor]b , which correspond to @xmath39 . however , our results are similar if we use smaller times ( as long as @xmath40 ) .     at @xmath25",
    "( so @xmath41 ) .",
    "averaging over many trajectories from the same initial condition , we show the mean profile @xmath42 and its standard deviation @xmath43 .",

    "the separation between these two cases motivates the definition of the ( coarse - grained ) @xmath49 ) . , width=321 ]    to illustrate this behaviour , we have simulated trajectories of the east model , starting from a particular initial condition that helps to reveal the physical processes at work . fig .  [",
    "fig : prof ] shows the time - averaged spins @xmath42 and their variances @xmath43 , where the subscript `` ic '' indicates that the average was taken with a fixed initial condition ( in contrast to other averages in this work which are conventional averages over equilibrium trajectories ) .",
    "we emphasise the following three points :    * all of the @xmath42 are either close to @xmath10 or of order @xmath50 . also , the standard deviation @xmath51 for all spins .",
    "thus , for this initial condition and for each of these times @xmath28 , one almost certainly finds a profile @xmath33 that is close to a reference profile @xmath52 .",
    "each reference profile ( one for each value of @xmath28 shown ) can therefore be identified with a metastable state that is stable on a time scale @xmath28 .",
    "* for @xmath53 , any spins with @xmath54 are separated by at least @xmath35 spins with @xmath55 .",
    "if two up spins are closer than this in the initial condition then the rightmost of them is within the mobile domain associated with the leftmost one . in that case , the rightmost spin ( @xmath56 ) tends to flip many times and @xmath57 converges to a value close to @xmath11 . * for this initial condition ( and these time scales ) , the system relaxes independently in each of 6 independent regions .",
    "this means that the dynamical evolution of separate patches of the system can be treated independently .     that indicates its lifetime ( of order @xmath22 ) . to describe the profile we use a notation suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig : prof ] , based on the relative sizes of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "we distinguish four cases : ( i )  a 1 represents a spin with @xmath60 ( up to a tolerance much less than @xmath10 ) ; ( ii )  a dot represents a spin with @xmath61 ; ( iii )  a c represents a spin with @xmath62 ( up to a tolerance much less than @xmath11 ) ;  ( iv ) an x represents a spin with @xmath63 ( that is , a typical value @xmath11 with a tolerance much less than @xmath10 but bigger than @xmath11 ) .",

    "arrows indicate how a profile on one time scale evolves into a different profile after averaging over a longer time scale .",
    "some states have more than one outward arrow , indicating that they may evolve into one of several possible profiles , so they are on a borderline between the various ( more stable ) states into which they may evolve . , width=321 ]",
    "these three points establish the central requirements for our analysis of metastable states .",
    "the first shows that the metastable states in this system are well - defined , while the second shows that metastable states with different lifetimes have different internal structures .",
    "the third point establishes that one may decompose the behaviour of the system into independent regions , at least for this initial condition . building on this point , fig .",
    "[ fig : hier ] shows how the local behaviour evolves with time , for various different initial conditions ( the predictions shown follow from the superspin analysis of  @xcite and are also consistent with our numerical results ) .",
    "we note that while some initial conditions belong to a single metastable state ( and always yield the same time - averaged profile @xmath33 ) , there are other initial conditions that exist on the border between states ( and therefore may yield one of several profiles ) . for these cases",
    ", it will not be true that @xmath51 , but it is true that for typical trajectories , @xmath66 for some metastable state @xmath67 .",
    "in general , the analysis of kurchan and laloux  @xcite indicates that typical configurations of any large finite - dimensional system always lie on a border between states .",
    "for the east model , this result follows from the observation that the local configuration @xmath68 will occur many times in a large system : in the regions where this occurs , the system may relax into one of two averaged profiles [ either @xmath69 or @xmath70 , ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hier ] ) ] .",
    "hence a typical configuration of the system can not be associated to a single averaged profile .",
    "however , a key insight from  @xcite is that while it is not possible to establish a one - to - one mapping between initial conditions and metastable states , it is possible to establish such a mapping between profiles @xmath33 and metastable states .",
    "we now turn to the patch - repetition analysis proposed by kurchan and levine  @xcite as a method for analysis of metastable states .",
    "we wish to consider the probability distribution of profiles @xmath33 , since these are in one - to - one correspondence with metastable states .",

    "however , in the east model , we have @xmath73 ( recall fig .  [ fig : prof ] ) so we define @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a step function , and the threshold @xmath76 ( results depend weakly on this threshold ) .",

    "the number of rods decreases , with @xmath184 ( and therefore @xmath185 ) as @xmath186 .",
    "the large-@xmath166 limit is similar to the entropy crises found in mean - field models  @xcite , except that @xmath187 with a diverging gradient @xmath188 : this is the reason that the transition takes place as @xmath186  @xcite . in summary , we find that @xmath189 is a smooth function of @xmath166 , with singular behaviour only as @xmath190 .",
    "this means that phase transitions only occur at zero temperature , as expected in the east model  @xcite .      in the previous subsection , we analysed atypical states in the east model using the superspin picture of  @xcite and the numerical results that we obtained for typical states .",
    "kurchan and levine  @xcite proposed a method for numerical investigation of atypical states , via the ensemble ( [ equ : q - ens ] ) .",
    "however , numerical sampling of such biased ensembles is difficult , since these ensembles are dominated by configurations that are far from typical . in the remainder of this section we analyse different methods for analysing rare metastable states .",
    "we use the east model as a representative example , but the main aspects of the discussion apply quite generally to models with many metastable states .    the method proposed in  @xcite for analysis of atypical states was based on renyi complexities ( see for example  @xcite ) : the idea is that one estimates a quantity @xmath191 that can be used to infer the free energy associated with a patch @xmath192 of size @xmath79 .",
    "each possible patch has a free energy density that is estimated as @xmath193 $ ] where @xmath194 is the number of times that patch @xmath192 appears in @xmath78 [ recall ( [ equ : s - patch ] ) ] .",
    "writing @xmath195 and comparing with ( [ equ : p - alpha ] ) motivates the analogy between @xmath196 and the free energy density @xmath197 .    then , one may analyse the @xmath166-ensemble by giving extra statistical weight to patches with large ( or small ) values of @xmath198 .",
    "that is , consider a patch - analogue of ( [ equ : q - ens ] ) where one assigns patch probabilities : @xmath199 with @xmath200 . since",
    "@xmath196 can be estimated directly via @xmath194 , one may also estimate a free - energy - like quantity , which is the renyi complexity : @xmath201^q .",
    "\\label{equ : renyi } \\ ] ] the patch quantity @xmath202 is analogous to the quantity @xmath203 , defined for states in the previous section . for large enough @xmath79",
    ", one expects the modified ensemble defined by ( [ equ : q - patch ] ) to resemble that defined by ( [ equ : q - ens ] ) .    from a numerical perspective",
    ", this approach is difficult  one is attempting to reconstruct a biased ensemble using data from an equilibrium one , and typical configurations from the two ensembles are quite different from one another .",
    "the usual approach to this problem is to use a biased sampling scheme such as umbrella sampling  @xcite for ensembles of configurations , or transition path sampling  @xcite for ensembles of trajectories .",
    "here the situation is subtle : while the bias in ( [ equ :",
    "q - ens ] ) appears to be a configurational one , based on free energies of states , we recall that any practical sampling scheme uses _ time - averaged _ profiles to infer the relevant states .",
    "this means that patches that are rare in ( [ equ : renyi ] ) may be associated with unusual metastable states , or they may be associated with rare dynamical events in which the averaged profile @xmath33 does not converge to any of the profiles @xmath72 that are associated with metastable states in the system .",
    "this motivates us to consider the relation to dynamical sampling methods and recent work on dynamical large deviations .",
    "the statistical properties of _ time - integrated _ dynamical quantities have received considerable interest recently , especially through studies of large deviations in glassy systems  @xcite ( including the east model  @xcite ) .",
    "the most relevant situation for this work is the one considered for a spin - glass model in @xcite , where the time @xmath28 ( there called @xmath204 ) is well - separated from both a fast ( intra - state ) relaxation time scale @xmath205 and a slow ( inter - state ) relaxation time @xmath206 .",
    "the question of interest there is : given a quantity @xmath207 that can be evaluated for a given configuration , what is the probability distribution of @xmath208 ?",
    "clearly , this is closely related to distributions of the quantities considered here , such as @xmath209 .",
    "we note that in  @xcite , the _ fast _ time scale @xmath205 was comparable with the equilibrium relaxation time of the system , while the _ slow _ time scale was much longer still . here",
    "we consider the case where @xmath210 : for example @xmath211 and @xmath212 , as above .",
    "nevertheless , the main results of  @xcite apply also in this case .",
    "in particular , one may consider a biased ensemble where a dynamical trajectory @xmath213 occurs with probability @xmath214 = \\mathrm{prob}[{\\mathcal{c}}(t)|0 ] \\cdot { \\mathrm{e}}^{-sk[{\\mathcal{c}}(t ) ] } \\cdot \\frac{1 } { z_\\mathrm{d}(s ) } .",
    "\\label{equ : s - ens}\\ ] ] here , the short - hand notation @xmath215 $ ] indicates dependence on a trajectory of the system ( with time running from @xmath9 to @xmath28 ) , while @xmath216 $ ] is the probability of trajectory @xmath213 at equilibrium , and @xmath217 is a normalisation constant .",
    "following  @xcite , in the joint limit @xmath218 , this biased ensemble develops a singular dependence on @xmath219 .",
    "that is , if the average value of @xmath220 within state @xmath67 is @xmath221 then for @xmath222 the ensemble is dominated by the metastable state(s ) with minimal @xmath221 , while for @xmath223 it is dominated by state(s ) with maximal @xmath221 .    if one replaces @xmath224 in ( [ equ : s - ens ] ) , one sees that trajectories are now being biased according to their average values of @xmath207 ( instead of their integrated value ) . assuming that dynamical fluctuations can be neglected ( that is",
    ", @xmath225 , due to separation of time scales ) , and that every trajectory is localised in a single metastable state , one arrives at @xmath214 \\approx \\mathrm{prob}[{\\mathcal{c}}(t)|0 ] \\cdot { \\mathrm{e}}^{-\\lambda k_{\\alpha[{\\mathcal{c}}(t ) ] } } \\cdot \\frac{1}{z_\\mathrm{d}(\\lambda / t)}\\ ] ] where @xmath226 $ ] is the state within which @xmath213 is localised . in that case , one may write the probability of state @xmath67 as @xmath227 where @xmath228 is a normalisation constant . physically ,",
    "( [ equ : lambda - ens ] ) indicates that the effect of weak bias @xmath229 in ( [ equ : s - ens ] ) is to reshuffle probability between metastable states , in a similar way to that anticipated in ( [ equ : q - ens ] ) .",
    "one may also conjecture that the singular dependence of the ensemble in ( [ equ : s - ens ] ) on the parameter @xmath219 might be resolved as a smooth change on a scale @xmath229 .",
    "( note however that this behaviour would still be far beyond any linear - response regime . )",
    "further , if @xmath207 can be chosen so that @xmath230 , then ( [ equ : lambda - ens ] ) reduces to ( [ equ : q - ens ] ) , with @xmath231 . that would allow the ensemble of ( [ equ : q - ens ] ) to be sampled via the numerical methods that have been used already to sample the @xmath219-ensemble .",
    "in fact this is a relatively simple matter in the east model , since @xmath174 is tightly correlated with the total density of up spins @xmath232 , whose large deviations were considered in  @xcite",
    ". however , the construction required to obtain the statistics of metastable states is different from that used in most @xmath219-ensemble studies so far , since it would require analysis of trajectories with @xmath233 using @xmath229 ( where @xmath234 is the structural relaxation time ) : previous studies concentrated on the alternative limit @xmath235 and @xmath236 .",
    "the role of dynamical fluctuations also needs careful consideration when comparing results : we are assuming here that @xmath237 is always close to the relevant @xmath32 but ensuring that this is indeed the case for trajectories in the @xmath219-ensemble requires careful examination of the limit @xmath218 .",
    "finally , we recall that for non - zero @xmath11 , the east model has a phase transition in the @xmath219-ensemble , in the limit where @xmath238  @xcite .",
    "( this is distinct from possible singular behaviour if @xmath27 which clearly requires @xmath239 . )",
    "it is clear from  @xcite that this transition is associated with a `` phase - separated '' regime where time - averaged profiles become macroscopically inhomogeneous , containing a large `` bubble '' , free of excitations . in the language of hard rods",
    ", this bubble corresponds to a large rod ( length @xmath101 of the same order as the system size ) , with a commensurately long lifetime ( diverging with the system size ) . in general ,",
    "if states with very long lifetimes exist , one expects them to dominate the system for @xmath222 and @xmath240 : the necessary link  @xcite between the very long lifetime and a diverging length scale is particularly clear kcms such as the east model  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the patch - repetition analysis of kurchan and levine  @xcite is useful in identifying metastable states in the east model , and analysing their structure .",
    "the results are consistent with the analysis of sollich and evans  @xcite , as shown by the excellent fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : ent ] .",
    "knowledge of the metastable states can also be used to predict dynamical correlation functions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gr ] .",
    "we have emphasised that the patch - repetition analysis is inherently dynamical in nature , because of its construction from time - averaged density profiles . in this sense",
    ", it can be used to identify metastable states even in systems where the potential energy landscape is flat and featureless .",
    "( this observation can also be rationalised through the idea that the flat landscape is endowed with a non - trivial metric  @xcite , encapsulating the idea that motion within some regions of the landscape may be much faster than motion between those regions . )    finally , we compared several different ways of analysing the distribution of metastable states within a system , through biased ensembles in which patch probabilities are reweighted ( [ equ : q - patch ] ) and through ensembles where trajectories are biased by some time - averaged measure ( [ equ : s - ens ] ) . in the end , these methods for numerical analysis of metastable states must be tested on atomistic models , to understand how efficient they are and how useful their results will be .",
