    "the problem of short waves ( or waves with high wave numbers ) in acoustics , electromagnetics or surface water wave applications was listed as an unsolved problem in finite element methods ( fems ) in 2000 by zienkiewicz in his review paper @xcite .",
    "it still remains open although some big progresses have been made since then . in this paper , we consider the following helmholtz problem : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a polygonal / polyhedral domain , @xmath16 , @xmath17 denotes the imaginary unit , and @xmath18 denotes the unit outward normal to @xmath19 .",
    "the above helmholtz problem is an approximation of the following acoustic scattering problem ( with time dependence @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the incident wave and @xmath8 is known as the wave number .",
    "the robin boundary condition is known as the first order approximation of the radiation condition ( cf .",
    "we remark that the helmholtz problem  also arises in applications as a consequence of frequency domain treatment of attenuated scalar waves ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    the difficulties of fems applied to the helmholtz problem",
    " with large wave number lie in both their theoretical analysis and numerical efficiency mainly due to the high indefiniteness of the problem . while for the one dimensional ( @xmath23-d ) case the fems have been well understood .",
    "ihlenburg and babuka @xcite proved that the linear fem for a @xmath23-d helmholtz problem satisfies the following error estimate under the mesh constraint @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 here @xmath9 is the mesh size and @xmath26 are positive constants independent of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that the first term on the right hand side of is of the same order as the interpolation error in @xmath3-seminorm .",
    "it dominates the error bound only if @xmath27 is small enough .",
    "the second term @xmath28 dominates if @xmath7 is fixed and @xmath8 is large enough .",
    "we remark that the condition of fixed @xmath7 , i.e. , several points per wavelength , is sometimes used as the  rule of thumb \" in the context of the numerical treatment of the helmholtz equation .",
    "the estimate says that this rule of thumb may give wrong results for large wave number @xmath8 .",
    "the second term is called the pollution error of the finite element solution . in one dimension",
    ", the pollution effect can be eliminated completely by a suitable modification of the discrete bilinear form ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the story for two and three dimensional helmholtz problems is much different .",
    "it is shown that , in two dimensions , the pollution effect can be reduced substantially but can not be avoided in principle ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as for the error estimates ,",
    "to the best of the author s knowledge , no analysis for the linear fem in two or three dimensions has been done when @xmath27 is large .",
    "note that the @xmath3- and @xmath12- error estimates can be derived by the so - called schatz argument if @xmath27 is small enough ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) but this condition is too strict for large @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a nice review on various fems for time - harmonic acoustics governed by the helmholtz equation . for results on @xmath29-fems ,",
    "we refer to @xcite but will not discuss here since we concern only methods using linear elements in this paper .",
    "the author would like to mention that , engquist and ying @xcite proposed recently some sweeping preconditioners for central difference schemes for the helmholtz equation which have linear application cost and the preconditioned iterative solver ( gmres ) converges in a number of iterations that is essentially independent of the number of unknowns or the frequency .",
    "although the sweeping techniques are well possible ( or have already been ) applied to the linear fem to provide efficient fast solvers , this combination is a not good candidate for efficient algorithm for the helmholtz problem with large wave number , since the linear fem itself is inefficient due to its ( big ) pollution effect .",
    "next , we will not go any further on the issue of fast solvers and focus on the stability and error analyses of the schemes based on linear elements .    in @xcite , feng and the author proposed and analyzed some interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) methods using piecewise linear polynomials for the problem  in two and three dimensions .",
    "it was proved that the proposed methods are unconditionally ( with respect to mesh size @xmath9 ) stable and well - posed for all wave numbers @xmath30 . moreover , under suitable assumptions on the penalty parameters , the following error estimates were proved .",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is some broken @xmath3-norm , @xmath33 means @xmath34 , and the constants @xmath10 s are positive and independent of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the penalty parameters .",
    "numerical tests show that it is possible to greatly reduce the pollution error and achieve better numerical results than fems by tuning the penalty parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods ( sometimes called discontinuous finite element methods ) which are initiated in seventies of the last century ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , use piecewise polynomials ( or problem dependent functions ) as trial and test functions .",
    "the continuity of the discrete solution across the interior edges / faces of elements is enforce weakly by introducing penalty terms or numerical fluxes . as is well known now",
    ", dg methods have several advantages over the ( continuous ) fems , such as , local mass conservation , flexibilities in constructing trial and test spaces and meshes , additional parameters that may be tuned for some particular purposes .",
    "while one disadvantage is that a dg method usually has larger number of total degrees of freedom ( dofs ) than the fem .",
    "for example , on a given triangulation of @xmath35 , the number of total dofs of the linear ipdg method is about six times of that of the linear fem in two dimensions and about @xmath36 times in three dimensions .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for other works on dg methods for helmholtz problems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose and analyze a linear continuous interior penalty finite element method ( cip - fem ) for the helmholtz problem . the cip - fem uses the same continuous piecewise linear finite element space as the linear fem but modifies the sesquilinear of the fem by adding a penalty term on the jumps of the flux across the interior edges / faces between elements , i.e. , @xmath37}{\\left[\\frac{{\\partial}v}{{\\partial}n_e}\\right ] } , \\label{ej}{\\displaybreak[0]}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the set of interior edges / faces .",
    "note that the cip - fem in this paper uses a pure - imaginary penalty parameter @xmath0 instead of a real one as the usual cip - fem does .",
    "this is helpful for theoretical analysis and numerical stability .",
    "it is should be remark that if the penalty parameter @xmath0 is replaced by a complex number with positive imaginary part , the ideas of the paper still apply . here",
    "we set its real part to be zero in the theoretical analysis for the ease of presentation .",
    "let @xmath40 be the cip finite element solution and let @xmath41 be the finite element solution .",
    "the following results are obtained .    *",
    "the cip - fem attains a unique solution for any @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath38 .",
    "* there exists a constant @xmath44 independent of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath11 , such that if @xmath45 and @xmath46 , then the following stability and error estimates hold : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "* suppose @xmath49 and @xmath45 .",
    "then the following estimates hold for the finite element solution @xmath41 . @xmath50 * estimates in the @xmath12-norm are also obtained .",
    "* numerical tests show that the penalty parameters may be tuned to greatly reduce the pollution errors .",
    "the cip - fems were originally proposed by douglas and dupont @xcite for second order elliptic and parabolic problems and have been shown to have advantages for advection dominated problems @xcite .",
    "similar interior penalty procedures for fems utilizing continuous functions have also been introduced for biharmonic equations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the cip - fem is introduced in section  [ sec-2 ] .",

    "the stability estimates in section  [ sec - sta ] and the error estimates in section  [ sec - err ] are improved to be of optimal order under the condition that @xmath51 is small enough by using the technique of so - called  stability - error iterative improvement \" developed in @xcite . in section  [ sec - fem ] , the well - posedness , stability and error estimates for the linear fem",
