    "although the standard picture of the stellar structure of disk galaxies combines a disk and a central bulge , recent studies have suggested a dichotomy between galaxies which host _ classical _ bulges  round , kinematically hot , and presumed to originate from violent mergers at high redshift  and those with _",
    "pseudobulges _ , where the central excess stellar light is from a flattened , kinematically cool structure , presumed to originate from some long - term , internal ( `` secular '' ) processes .",
    "we have recently found evidence that some disk galaxies can harbor both a classical bulge _ and _ a disky pseuduobulge ( we use the term `` disky pseudobulges '' to distinguish them from bar - derived box / peanut structures , which are sometimes also called pseudobulges ) .",
    "evidence for this includes a combination of highly flattened isophotes , disky substructures ( spirals , nuclear rings , nuclear bars ) , and stellar kinematics dominated by rotation in the disky pseudobulge , and rounder isophotes and stellar kinematics dominated by velocity dispersion in the classical - bulge region ; see @xcite and @xcite for details .    as part of our sinfoni search for supermassive black holes ( s@xmath0bh )",
    ", we observed approximately 30 disk and elliptical galaxies with the sinfoni ifu on the vlt , using natural- or laser - guide - star adaptive optics to obtain 3d @xmath1-band spectroscopy of the galaxy centers ; our sample includes three well - defined examples of composite - bulge galaxies .",
    "we combine the high - resolution stellar kinematics derived from this data with larger - scale , ground - based spectroscopy and _ hst _ and ground - based imaging to measure smbh masses via schwarzschild dynamical modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as part of the schwarzschild modeling process",
    ", we obtain weighted libraries of stellar orbits for the central galaxy regions ; these can be used to explore the relative contributions of ordered ( rotational ) and random stellar motions within classical and disky pseudobulge regions .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows part of this analysis , plotting the planar / vertical anisotropy of 3d stellar orbits as a function of radius for an s0 with a purely classical bulge ( ngc  1332 ) and for three composite - bulge galaxies .",
    "the anisotropy term measures the relative amounts of `` equatorial '' dispersion ( that is , radial and azimuthal dispersions added in quadrature ) versus vertical dispersion ( with respect to the equatorial plane ) .",
    "in all four galaxies , the dispersion is approximately isotropic within the classical - bulge region , and shifts to an equatorial - dominant state in the disk outside ( for ngc  1332 ) or in the disky pseudobulge region ( for the composite - bulge galaxies ) . this is additional evidence supporting the argument that what we identify as `` classical bulges '' in the composite - bulge systems are isotropic , pressure - supported components similar to low - luminosity ellipticals , while the disky pseudobulges have stellar kinematics similar to those of large - scale disks",
