    "<S> [ fig : mass dependence ] b ) , the behaviour for sufficiently high chern numbers , beyond the validity of can be different since ( i ) there exists an optimal chern number @xmath81 for which the repulsive casimir energy is maximum reaching @xmath82 of the value for perfect metallic plates and ( ii ) the force turns attractive beyond @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> + combining together our results we now establish an estimate for the physical realization of the effect . for two ci plates with chern number @xmath84 @xcite and single particle gap @xmath85 mev , </S>",
    "<S> the crossover lies at a distance of @xmath86 m . at the vicinity of the maximum , </S>",
    "<S> the typical magnitude of the pressure is a factor @xmath87 smaller that of the metal - metal casimir pressure ( calculated from @xmath88 ) and one order of magnitude bigger than that of graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although close to experimental limits , the resulting casimir pressure at such a separation is still within observable bounds @xcite . alternatively , </S>",
    "<S> multiorbital @xcite or multilayer materials @xcite with possible larger gaps can bring the force even further within measurable values . </S>",
    "<S> + we finish with some general remarks and consequences of the presented findings . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , note that repulsion is determined by the relative chirality of the edge states of each plate , which also establish the sign of the off - diagonal fresnel coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> since the hall effect is not induced externally , turning over one of the plates ( i.e. pointing its normal in the opposite direction @xmath89 ) will then change the sign of the off - diagonal fresnel coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to reversing the sign of one of the chern numbers and hence can turn attraction into repulsion and viceversa . </S>",
    "<S> this is an exclusive and differentiating feature of ci as compared to qhe systems arising from external magnetic fields @xcite , and endows the ci system with a remarkably simple way of manipulating the sign of the force . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , our discussion was restricted to ci that have the chemical potential @xmath77 within the single particle gap . </S>",
    "<S> if this is not so , the two systems will be metallic but still have a finite hall conductivity given by @xmath90@xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the force would be attractive due to the dominant fermi surface contribution of @xmath91 and @xmath92 times larger than for the insulating case . </S>",
    "<S> thus , also by doping electrostatically one of the two plates it is possible to tune from attraction to repulsion and viceversa . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in ref . @xcite the repulsive force between 3d - ti at _ short distances _ resulted from the competition between the @xmath93term present when the ti surface is gapped and the ordinary electromagnetic response . </S>",
    "<S> however , as for the present case , the finite frequency behavior of the @xmath93term @xcite can be important at certain length scales . </S>",
    "<S> including such an effect for all frequencies is an intricate calculation due to the difficulty of modelling the surface exactly . </S>",
    "<S> our results and , can serve as a first approximation to model the surface since it is gapped and also carries a quantized hall conductivity . interpreting our findings for the particular case where @xmath94 as a zero magnetic field analogue of the results of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where a qhe system also leads to repulsion has to be understood with caution since ( i ) there is a crucial sign difference in with respect to the qhe case that prevents the simple mapping @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the filling fraction and ( ii ) the possibility of tuning the sign of the force by simply turning over one of the plates is exclusive to the ci system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the refinement and complexity of casimir experiments makes the disposal of the external magnetic field a particularly valuable feature of the proposed ci system . </S>",
    "<S> the repulsive behavior discussed in this letter also applies to the fractional version of chern insulators i.e. fractional chern insulators ( fci ) @xcite that are many - body incompressible states with hall conductivities quantized to fractions of @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> + to conclude , we have shown that two chern insulator plates with finite chern numbers present a repulsive ( attractive ) casimir effect as long as the chern numbers have opposing ( equal ) signs . </S>",
    "<S> the force can be tuned to attraction by simply turning over one of the plates or by electrostatic doping . </S>",
    "<S> our results point towards ti thin films and multi - orbital systems with higher chern numbers @xcite as the most promising future route to realize and control casimir repulsion . </S>",
