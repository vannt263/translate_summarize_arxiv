    "it has become apparent that there exists a class of extragalactic x - ray sources significantly more luminous than normal x - ray binaries or supernova remnants , but less x - ray luminous than conventional agn such as seyfert nuclei ( fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "these intermediate - luminosity x - ray objects ( ixos , ptak 2001 ) or ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , makishima et al.(2000 ) ) have x - ray luminosities in the range @xmath6  @xmath7 ( equivalent to the entire eddington luminosity for accretion onto a @xmath8  @xmath9 mass object ) , but are generally _ not _ found at the dynamical center of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and hence are not likely to be supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) radiating inefficiently .    for example , recent _ chandra _ high resolution camera ( hrc ) observations of the prototypical starbursting dwarf peculiar galaxy m82 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) conclusively show that the bright x - ray variable source ( peak luminosity @xmath10 in the 0.510.0 kev energy band ) previously seen in _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ & _ asca _ observations ( see @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite among many other papers too numerous to mention ) lies @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) away from the dynamical center of the galaxy .",
    "the nature and origin of these objects remains unknown .",
    "the variability argues against models of supernova remnants evolving in dense surroundings @xcite , where a monotonic decline in x - ray luminosity might naively be expected ( but note this is not necessarily always true @xcite ) .",
    "the possible association between the luminous x - ray source in m82 and the known young supernova remnant 41.95 + 57.5 @xcite , advanced based on the source position derived from _ rosat _",
    "hri data , appears incorrect based on the more accurate _",
    "no persistent counterpart to this source at other wavelengths has been confirmed , although the transient radio source 41.4 + 59.7 @xcite , seen in one observation in 1981 but not subsequently , lies within the positional error circle of the m82 ixo @xcite and may be associated with the ixo .",
    "the currently favored interpretation is that these might be black holes of mass @xmath13 , intermediate between the smbhs ( @xmath14  @xmath15 ) found in traditional agn such as seyfert galaxies ( formed in some as yet unknown manner , which is possibly related to the growth of stellar bulges ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ) and black holes of a few solar masses ( formed naturally as a consequence of the stellar evolution of the most massive stars @xcite ) .",
    "however , alternative explanations not involving intermediate mass black holes do exist .",
    "@xcite argue that these x - ray sources are conventional high - mass x - ray binaries in which the x - ray emission happens to be beamed in our direction .",
    "@xcite report a possible optical blue continuum counterpart to an ixo in ngc 5204 , which might be an extremely luminous o star or a cluster of young stars .    here",
    "we report on the re - detection of a strongly variable x - ray luminous point source ( peak @xmath16 ) located at least 900 pc from the nucleus of the nearby starburst galaxy ngc 3628 ( d = 10 mpc , soifer et al.(1987 ) ) .",
    "this source , discovered to be variable by dahlem et al.(1995 ) , had faded by a factor @xmath3 between two _ rosat _ hri observations taken in late 1991 and early 1994 ( when it was too faint to be detected ) .",

    "ngc 3628 was observed with the _ chandra _ acis - s instrument on 2000 december 2 , for a total exposure time ( after the removal of background flares ) of 52289 s. the nucleus of the galaxy was placed at the aim point of the back - illuminated s3 chip ( the back illuminated chips are more sensitive to soft x - ray emission , and do not suffer from the radiation damage that compromises the spectral resolution of the front illuminated acis chips ) .",
    "much , but not all , of the disk of ngc 3628 falls within the boundaries of the s3 chip .",
    "the data was reduced and analyzed using ciao ( version 1.1.5 ) , heasoft ( version 5.0.2 ) and xspec ( version 11.0.1 ) . the latest _",
    "calibration and spectral response files appropriate for this observation were used .",
    "spectra were binned to achieve at least 20 counts per channel , to allow the use of @xmath18-fitting .",
    "our reduction and processing followed the guide lines released by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory center ( cxc ) and the acis instrument team .    the data reduction and analysis will be described in more detail in a forthcoming paper on the diffuse x - ray emission from this galaxy s starburst - driven superwind ( strickland et al.2001 , in preparation ) . here",
    "we will focus only on the brightest point source within the disk of the galaxy .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of ngc 3628 reveals a large number of hard x - ray point sources , embedded in highly structured and wide - spread diffuse soft x - ray emission ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ximage ] , which only shows the central @xmath19 region around the nucleus of the galaxy ) .",
    "one particularly luminous point source , at a position of @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( j2000.0 ) , stands out above all the rest , and accounts for a large fraction of the hard x - ray emission from the galaxy ( see   [ sec : results : spectral ] ) .",
    "following the recommended naming convention for _ chandra _ sources , we name this source cxou j112015.8 + 133514 , but for convenience we shall refer to it for the remainder of this paper as the ixo .",
    "previous x - ray studies of ngc 3628 had assumed that the x - ray emission was centered on the nucleus of the galaxy , given the limited absolute positional accuracies of previous x - ray instruments ( the highest resolution observations prior to _ chandra _ were with the _ rosat _ hri , which had @xmath22 absolute positional uncertainties of @xmath23 ) .",
    "in contrast , source coordinates derived from this _ chandra _ observation are accurate to @xmath17 , based on a cross - correlation between the positions of x - ray sources in the s2 and s3 chips ( excluding x - ray sources within the disk of ngc 3628 ) and optical sources from the apm catalog @xcite .    with these more accurate source",
    "coordinates it is clear that the ixo is _ not _ at the nucleus of ngc 3628 , if we make the reasonable assumption that the peaks of the k - band , hi , co and radio recombination line emission correspond to the nucleus of the galaxy ( see table  [ tab : nuclear_position ] for references .",
    "all of these emission maxima are within @xmath24 of each other ) .",
    "the nucleus of ngc 3628 is approximately @xmath1 to the east of the ixo ( see table  [ tab : nuclear_position ] ) .",
    "an offset of @xmath1 corresponds to a projected distance of 970 pc ( possibly considerably more physically ) , given the assumed distance of 10 mpc .",
    "although the kinematic center of the larger - scale hi distribution @xcite is offset to the north - west of the nucleus by about @xmath25 , it is also @xmath26 from the ixo .    as this source has a luminosity only a factor @xmath27 lower than the peak luminosity of the bright source seen by the _ rosat _",
    "hri ( see   [ sec : results : variability ] ) , and there were no other comparable luminosity sources seen in previous observations , it seems most probable that the ixo is the same source as the variable hri source discussed in @xcite .",

    "images supports this interpretation , based on the relative position of other weak x - ray sources found in both sets of observations .",
    "we have searched for an optical , near - ir or radio counterpart to this source .",
    "r - band optical images @xcite reveal the location of the ixo to be within one of the dust lanes obscuring much of the disk of ngc 3628 . within a @xmath28 radius of the _ chandra_-derived position of the ixo",
    "the optical surface brightness is relatively uniform , and there are no obvious star clusters or other features visible .",
    "k - band imaging , taken by colbert , also revealed no features within a @xmath29 radius of the ixo s position .",
    "no radio source was detected in the 15  ghz vla a - configuration data from @xcite .",
    "the 3@xmath30 upper limit of 0.24 mj / beam corresponds to a radio power p @xmath31 3 @xmath32 10@xmath33 w  hz@xmath34 , about an order of magnitude more luminous than the galactic supernova remnant cas  a , but @xmath35  1000 times lower than typical radio supernovae @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] shows the acis spectrum of the ixo , extracted using a circular aperture of radius @xmath36 . for the purposes of background subtraction we used a circular aperture of radius @xmath37 ,",
    "offset @xmath1 directly to the west of the ixo , having excluded the region around the bright source itself and around the five other _ chandra_-detected x - ray sources falling within this region .",
    "use of a local background region is warranted , given the presence of extended diffuse soft x - ray emission ( associated with the starburst - driven wind ) throughout the disk of ngc 3628 .",
    "we fit a variety of different spectral models to the _ chandra _ spectrum using the data in the energy range 0.3  8.0 kev , focusing mainly on models traditionally associated with agn ( absorbed power laws ) or other ixos observed with asca ( multi - color disk models , see @xcite ) .",
    "an absorbed power law provides the simplest statistically acceptable fit to the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , table  [ tab : specfits ] ) .",
    "absorbed multi - color disk , bremsstrahlung or mekal hot plasma models @xcite are all statistically unacceptable fits to the ixo spectrum ( reduced @xmath38  @xmath39 ) .",
    "statistically good fits can be obtained using these models if an additional hard component was added to the model .",
    "two component spectra , comprising a soft multi - color disk with a hard power law tail , have been found for other ixos using _ asca _ spectroscopy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the model parameters of the added power law or gaussian line model used as this hard component are very poorly constrained , and physically some of the parameters are not realistic , so it is not clear if this apparent hard component is real or not",
    ".    a small fraction of the events detected from this source will be due to pile - up ( the mis - identification of two or more x - ray photons falling within the same pixel during a single ccd exposure of 3.2s as a single photon of higher energy ) .",
    "this has many affects , the simplest of which is a systematic hardening of the spectrum , which is a possible cause of the additional hard component the spectral fits appear to require .",
    "the pimms count - rate calculator predicts @xmath40% of the total counts are piled - up given the observed count rate of this source .",
    "this is close to the 10% level at which the cxc warn that spectra are likely to be significantly affected , suggesting pile - up may be a problem .    to investigate whether there is appreciable pile - up in the ngc 3628 ixo spectrum we compared the event grade branching ratios ( the fraction of events with a given grade , see the _ chandra _ proposers observatory guide ) for photons with @xmath41 ( kev ) @xmath42 from the ixo ( 1646 events ) with the summed emission from the 14 next brightest point sources seen in ngc 3628 which are individually too faint to suffer from any pile - up ( 672 events in total ) .",
    "pile - up leads to a systematic increase in the fraction of events with high grades ( e.g.  asca grades 5 , 6 & 7 ) .",
    "however , we find that the event grade branching ratios for the ixo and the summed fainter point source emission are identical to within @xmath43 for all grades , which suggests that there is no appreciable pile - up in the ngc 3628 ixo spectrum . applying this technique to the public 34 ks _",
    "acis - i observation of m82 ( obsid 361 ) shows a very significant migration of the events from the m82 ixo to higher grades with respect to the fainter point sources in m82 .",
    "other evidence that the hard excess seen in the ngc 3628 ixo is not due to pile - up is that spectral fitting of a brighter point source seen in our two _ chandra _ observations of ngc 253 ( weaver et al .",
    ", in preparation ) shows no sign of a hard excess , even though the predicted pile - up fraction is 12  14% ( higher than the ngc 3628 ixo ) , and the total number of counts in the spectrum is similar to that in the ngc 3628 ixo spectrum .",
    "statistically acceptable multi - color disk spectral models _ can _ be obtained if we restrict the energy range used to 0.3  5.0 kev ( _ i.e .",
    "_ deliberately excluding data in the energy range where the multi - color disk model does worst ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that absorbed power law and absorbed bremsstrahlung models provide marginally better fits to the data in this restricted energy range .",
    "it therefore seems that a power law model provides the best description of the current spectral state of this source , and that a multi - color disk model does _ not _ provide an adequate fit to the spectrum of the ixo .",
    "source count rates and absorption - corrected fluxes and luminosities , assuming the power law spectral model ( using the restricted 0.3  5.0 kev energy range ) , are given in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .",
    "all spectral fits give absorption columns in the range @xmath44  @xmath45 .",
    "these columns are consistent with foreground absorption of the source by the edge - on disk of ngc 3628 , and its location in or behind the optical dust lane .",
    "it is not easy to compare our _ chandra _ spectra of the ixo with previous x - ray spectral studies of the nucleus ngc 3628 , using the _ rosat _ pspc @xcite or _ asca _",
    "@xcite , given the significant variability of the ixo and the much poorer spatial resolution of the earlier observations ( the _ rosat _ pspc spectrum covers a region @xmath46 kpc in radius , and the _ asca _ spectra a region @xmath47 kpc in radius ) .",
    "the most detailed existing spectral study is that of @xcite , who performed a joint spectral fit of the pspc and _ asca _ spectra , taking into account the variability between the two observations .",
    "this joint spectrum is best characterized by two soft thermal components and a hard absorbed power law .",
    "the photon index and hydrogen column derived for the power law component ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) agree well with the _ chandra_-based power law fit to the emission from the ixo .",
    "the close agreement between the power law slopes may be fortuitous , as most of the hard x - ray counts in the asca spectrum must have been from other point sources in ngc 3628 and not from the ixo itself . even in its present state , which is several times more luminous than it was during the 1993 asca observations ( see   [ sec : results : variability ] ) , hard x - ray emission from sources other than the ixo still provide a significant fraction ( @xmath50% ) of the 2.0  8.0 kev count rate in the central region of ngc 3628 . within a @xmath51 radius region ,",
    "the _ chandra _ observations reveal at least 33 other point - like x - ray sources , in addition to the diffuse thermal emission associated with the starburst .",
    "we find that the ixo only provides @xmath52% of the acis - s3 0.3  8.0 kev energy band count rate within a radius of @xmath51 from the source . in the 2.0  8.0 kev energy band",
    "the ixo is more dominant , providing 67% of the acis - s3 counts , _ but emission from the rest of the galaxy is always significant_.    we estimate that these other point sources , along with the diffuse emission , account for @xmath53% of the total _",
    "asca _ count rate ( the main uncertainty is the uncertainty in the _ asca _ count rate @xcite ) . as the ixo , at the luminosity observed in december 2000 , would produce @xmath54% of the total _ asca _",
    "count rate itself , the ixo must have been less luminous in 1993 than it is now .",
    "the shape of the hard spectral component in the joint _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ spectral fit was therefore largely determined by the 30 or so other hard x - ray point sources within the central @xmath51 of ngc 3628 .",
    "it is worth noting that _ chandra _ provides _ a spectrum that is unambiguously that of the ixo alone _  the same can not be so easily said for _ asca _ spectra of ixos , which are typically of a region a few arcminutes in radius .",
    "the luminosity of these objects is very similar to that of the rest of the normal spiral or starburst galaxies they inhabit .",
    "that contamination of the _ asca _ spectra by unrelated binary and diffuse x - ray emission may be biasing _",
    "spectral fits in favor of the multi - color disk spectral model is a legitimate concern .    to investigate whether spectral contamination ( at the level of @xmath55% of the hard x - ray counts that we find in ngc 3628 ) does bias the fitted spectral shape of the hard x - ray emission",
    ", we extracted a spectrum of all the emission within a 3 arcminute radius of the ixo ( approximately the same region an _ asca _ spectrum would cover ) .",
    "we fit the spectrum with spectral models comprising two absorbed soft thermal components and an absorbed hard component ( either a power law or a multi - color disk model ) , based on the good empirical fit such three component models give to the combined _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ spectra of starbursts @xcite . for the _ chandra _ spectrum ,",
    "two soft thermal components are required to obtain a statistically acceptable fit , but the hard component can equally well be fitted by a multi - color disk or a power law ( the difference between the two fits is not significant : @xmath56 for a change by 1 in the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the spectral shape of the fitted hard component ( best - fitting , @xmath57 or @xmath58 ) was statistically consistent with the spectral fits to the ixo alone , except for a higher model normalization due to the flux from the 33 other x - ray point sources .",
    "this suggests that the reason we do not find the ixo spectrum to be clearly better fit by the multi - color disk model strongly favored by _ asca _",
    "observations of other ixos ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is due to a real spectral difference between this source and the other ixos , and not due to spectral contamination ( at least not spectral contamination at the 30% level ) .",
    "one possibility is that ixos can change spectral state , from soft states described by the multi - color disk model to harder power law spectral states ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , and that we are observing the ngc 3628 ixo in such a hard spectral state .",
    "this source displays strong variability on the time scale of months or years ( dahlem et al.1995 ) .",
    "we are now able to improve previous estimates of the x - ray flux of this source over time by making use of the better - determined _ chandra _ spectrum , and by making use of _ chandra _ s spatial resolution to correct the _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ flux measurements for the contribution from the other point sources and diffuse emission .    within the @xmath59 hour duration of our _ chandra _ observation the count rate of the bright source , in either the broad",
    "( 0.3  8.0 kev ) or hard energy band ( 2.0  8.0 kev ) , is statistically consistent with being constant ( although this does not exclude genuine variation on the order of @xmath35% or less ) .",

    "chandra _ gto program ( ptak 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "we used the power law model that best - fits the chandra spectrum to predict _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ ( pspc & hri ) and _ asca _ count rates .",
    "the ratio of the observed to predicted count rate , for any particular observation , multiplied by the absorption corrected x - ray flux ( 0.3  8.0 kev energy band ) from this chandra observation is the estimated x - ray flux plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : historical ] .    for the _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ pspc and _ asca _ observations we have calculated a correction to obtain the flux due to the bright source alone ( given the significant flux from other point sources and diffuse emission , see ",
    "[ sec : results : spectral ] ) .",
    "we estimate that approximately 48% of the _ einstein _ count rate , 33% of the _ rosat _ pspc count rate and 78% of the _ asca _ count rate was due to diffuse x - ray emission and point sources other than the ixo .",
    "the relative fluxes of the ixo during the einstein rosat and asca observations differ somewhat from the work of dahlem et al.(1995 ) and @xcite , due to our correction for emission from other point sources and diffuse gas , and due to the strong dependence of absorption - corrected flux on the assumed spectral shape .",
    "the ixo was substantially brighter in the early 1990s than it is now , with an intrinsic x - ray luminosity ( 0.3  8.0 kev energy band ) of @xmath60 .",
    "this makes it one of the most luminous ixos , only slightly less luminous than the source in m82 ( kaaret et al.2001 ; makishima et al.2000 ) . a drop in flux by a factor @xmath61 occurred between late 1991 dec .",
    "and 1994 may ( dahlem et al.1995 ) .",
    "our estimate of a low x - ray flux from the ixo in the 1993 december _ asca _ observation is consistent with this fading , given the non - detection of the source by the _ rosat _",
    "hri only 5 months later .",
    "one should bear in mind that fig .",
    "[ fig : historical ] is based on the assumption that spectral shape of the source has remained the same , only changing in absolute luminosity .",
    "given the large variations in derived luminosity , it is quite possible that the spectral shape has changed , due to intrinsic changes in the source itself or possibly even variations in foreground absorption ( as discussed by @xcite ) .",
    "what is this x - ray - luminous source ? given the substantial offset of the brightest x - ray source from the nucleus of ngc 3628 ( @xmath62 pc ) , this object can not be a smbh inefficiently radiating x - rays , as dynamical friction would make a smbh fall to the center of the galaxy within an astronomically short time .",
    "this object is clearly another example of an ixo ( or ulx ) .",
    "is it a candidate intermediate mass black hole , or can it be explained by models involving x - ray - luminous supernovae or beamed x - ray emission from normal bh binaries ?    interpretations of this source as either a young x - ray luminous snr or a supernova remnant evolving in a high - density medium @xcite have problems .",
    "most young snrs have soft thermal x - ray spectra @xcite , unlike the observed _ chandra _ spectrum of this object (   [ sec : results : spectral ] ) .",
    "spectrally this source is consistent with some models of supernovae in high - density environments which predict power - law - like x - ray spectra with photon indices of @xmath63 ",
    "@xmath64 @xcite , as the power law spectral model fit to the chandra spectrum gives @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , the pattern of source variability seen ( the observed increase in flux after the original peak and strong decline , see   [ sec : results : variability ] ) , along with an upper limit on the radio flux at this location significantly lower than known radio supernovae (   [ sec : results : spatial ] ) , are convincing evidence against a supernova - related interpretation .",
    "although the _ asca _ spectra of most other known ixos are clearly better fit by a multi - color disk model than a power law model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , our _ chandra _ spectrum is better fit by a power law than by a multi - color disk model .",
    "three ixos observed with _",
    "asca _ appear to show changes in spectral state , from a soft state well represented by a multi - color disk to a hard state best modeled as a power law ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it is possible that the ngc 3628 source represents another ixo in such a hard spectral state .",
    "our fitted power law slope , @xmath4 , is very similar to that seen in galactic bh binary candidates in their hard state ( see references in @xcite ) , or to the canonical @xmath65 power law of agn .",
    "more _ chandra _ spectra of ixos will be necessary to convincingly determine the spectral properties of this class of object .    with an absorption - corrected 0.3  8.0 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath66 in this observation ( assuming the emission to be isotropic ) , and a peak luminosity of perhaps @xmath60 in the early 1990s ,",

    "both of these objects display strong variability , with x - ray luminosities changing by at least an order - of - magnitude over a period of a few years .",

    "another luminous x - ray source @xmath69 to the east of the nucleus ( but still within the disk of ngc 3628 ) was detected in the earlier _ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations ( source 14 in @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately this source lies outside the region covered in these chandra observations , but should be covered in the recent ( currently unpublished ) _ xmm - newton _ observation of ngc 3628 . based on the relative _ rosat _ pspc count rates and assuming a similar spectrum for both objects , the second ixo had an absorption - corrected 0.3  8.0 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath70 in late 1991 .    that both m82 and ngc 3628 are also both archetypal starburst galaxies is perhaps a coincidence , but it is interesting to speculate on the possibility of a link between the formation of large numbers of massive stars and the growth of massive black holes from stellar mass remnants ( taniguchi et al.2000 ) .",
    "there is some form of relationship between starbursts and type 2 seyfert galaxies ( heckman et al.1989 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; cid fernandes & terlevitch 1995 ; gonzlez delgado , heckman & leitherer 2001 ; levenson , weaver & heckman 2001a , 2001b ) , although not necessarily directly evolutionary in kind . if ixos are intermediate mass black holes , might they be a `` missing - link '' connecting star formation and black hole formation ?    the model of ixos as relatively normal bh x - ray binaries ( or perhaps analogues of the galactic microquasars ) remains a strong contender .",
    "as @xcite argue , the apparently high numbers of ixos in star - forming galaxies may be a problem for models invoking intermediate mass black holes .",
    "in contrast , elevated chances of seeing a beamed ( but otherwise normal ) x - ray binary are expected in starburst galaxies . the high - amplitude variability seen in both",
    "the ngc 3628 and m82 ixos is also a natural consequence of this model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "testing the various hypotheses currently in the literature requires coordinates of ixos accurate to @xmath71 , in order to search for counterparts at other wavelengths ( e.g.  very dense young stellar clusters , or binary companions under the beaming hypothesis ) and to study the environments in which these objects are found and may have formed in .",
    "this is a job only _",
    "chandra _ can perform .",
    "it is clear that _ chandra _ has much to offer in the study of these x - ray sources . as we have demonstrated with this study of the ixo in ngc 3628 , it is possible to obtain absolute positions accurate to within @xmath17 , and spectra free from contamination by unrelated x - ray point sources and diffuse emission",
