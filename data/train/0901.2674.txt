    "controlled quantum teleportation @xcite is a variant in which a teleportation of a quantum state is performed under the supervision of controllers .",
    "schemes using qubits as keys distributed among controllers @xcite have been extensively studied and economization of required resources has been accomplished with respect to the number of qubits involved in an entangled qubit chain used in a scheme .",
    "the studies also include a security discussion on players cheating controllers @xcite .",
    "it is expected that a multifunctional quantum network is realized for a consumer market in future , presumably based on optical fibers .",
    "so far , simple quantum cryptosystems @xcite are highly developed @xcite toward the consumer use , which are mainly used to generate classical shared cryptographic keys .",
    "an advanced quantum network should be used not only for generating a classical key but for exchanging quantum states . a network with einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs as links",
    "@xcite is a plausible form for this purpose ; optical quantum teleportation has already become a well - established subject supported by many experimental demonstrations reported in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . considering an application for office networks",
    ", it is demanded that data transfers can be under the control of multiple supervisors .",
    "controlled teleportation schemes have been developed to enable this feature .",
    "as the number of usable qubits and the quality of entanglement enhances , this function is approaching reality . a function like a vote to permit a transfer",
    "is also considered to be of public demand .",
    "qubit keys are commonly used in controlled quantum teleportation schemes for the basic control such that approvals of all the controllers are required to let the players transfer a quantum state .",
    "in such a control , use of qubit keys is sufficient and extending each dimension of a quantum system for a key causes a redundancy .",
    "qudits ( @xmath3-dimensional quantum systems ) with @xmath6 have been , in contrast , considered to be useful as keys when a vote for decision is in order .",
    "it is easy to notice that such functions are enabled by using a threshold scheme @xcite : controlling a transfer of a quantum state with a certain threshold in the number of controllers is implemented by secret sharing schemes ( see , e.g. , a discussion in ref .",
    "this categorizes controlled quantum teleportation as a combination of quantum secret sharing and quantum teleportation .",
    "a well - known polynomial coding @xcite over @xmath1 with prime @xmath7 larger than the number @xmath5 of participants ( controllers in our context ) is a quick solution can be equal to @xmath5 if @xmath5 is prime in the context of controlled quantum teleportation ( see sec .

    "a classical or quantum @xmath0-threshold scheme applied to a shared state of players and controllers enables a control such that a receiver can recover an original state when and only when @xmath8 or more controllers among @xmath5 provide their keys .",
    "there is a variant of quantum polynomial coding robust against a certain number of cheaters among participants @xcite .",
    "a drawback to introduce a polynomial coding scheme in controlled quantum teleportation is that computation is conducted over the field @xmath9 .",
    "thus each qudit distributed among controllers should have the dimension @xmath4 .",
    "this also complicates a quantum circuit to compute a matrix equation for the coding . for a threshold scheme , i.e. , a secret sharing without imposing access structure ,",
    "the dimension of each key ( share ) using best known classical protocols @xcite is @xmath10 ( namely , @xmath11 bits for each key ) for a long secret .",
    "these protocols require the bit length of a secret @xmath11 and that of a key at least as much as the length of a secret . for a short secret ,",
    "a best known classical protocol is shamir s one @xcite in which each key has the dimension @xmath12 .",
    "it is thus not motivating to simply make a quantum extension of the classical protocols .",
    "it was reported that an @xmath13-threshold secret sharing of a classical secret is achieved by a sort of key distribution without entanglement @xcite and an @xmath13-threshold controlled quantum teleportation is achieved by using classical keys @xcite .",
    "the latter one is easily extended to a @xmath0-threshold controlling scheme .",

    "in this paper , we introduce a @xmath0-threshold controlled quantum teleportation scheme over @xmath1 with prime @xmath2 using @xmath5 qubits for the controllers portion in addition to classical information distributed to the controllers .",
    "this is achieved by a hybrid of classical and quantum protocols .",
    "it enables a reduction in the dimension of each qudit to two for general @xmath0 , which is a significant improvement for realizing the scheme .",
    "in contrast to classical systems , the dimension of a quantum system is limited and usually a large - dimensional qudit is implemented by multiple qubits .",

    "it should be noted that , although we consider the control of a single channel here , it is straightforward to attach controllers to each channel . thus let us limit setups to the illustrated one in the following .",

    "measuring @xmath44 in the @xmath43 basis results in the phase factor @xmath45 depending on the outcome @xmath46 ( here , @xmath47 ; the operation `` @xmath48 '' returns one if its two arguments are equal and zero otherwise ) of a qubit can be written as @xmath49 using the @xmath43-basis states @xmath50 . ] . in this case",
    ", bob first applies @xmath51 to @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , he applies a single @xmath52 gate to @xmath38 for recovery if the number of @xmath53 s in the controllers outcomes ( @xmath54 ) is odd .",
    "the final state of bob after these operations becomes @xmath55 .",
    "the teleportation is successful in this way .    in this contribution",
    ", we aim to introduce a threshold - control scheme in which the shared state @xmath56 is engineered to be different from the ghz state .",
    "we continue to concentrate on the case where only a single qubit of bob is under the control , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; this is because it is straightforward to extend the scheme so that multiple qubits are under the control .",

    "let us begin with a rather expensive scheme that is a straightforward extension of a classical secret sharing . in this scheme",
    ", the state of the controllers portion is assumed to be in the following form @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath3 is a positive integer ) , and @xmath61 is a certain set of @xmath5-digit strings ; the computational basis for each @xmath44 is chosen arbitrarily and known by the @xmath62th controller .",
    "there are two conditions for the state appropriate for a @xmath0-threshold scheme : + ( i ) @xmath63 can not be uniquely determined unless the sequence @xmath64 is completely specified ( i.e. , unless the variables @xmath65 are all specified ) .",
    "+ ( ii ) a string @xmath64 is uniquely determined in @xmath61 by fixing any @xmath8 digits of @xmath65 .",
    "+ under these conditions , @xmath8 controllers measurements result in a single surviving vector @xmath66 .",
    "thus bob can recover the original state by the following process ( in addition to the usual process for the original quantum teleportation for @xmath67 ) .",
    "first bob changes the phase factor @xmath68 to unity by applying @xmath69 to the qubit @xmath38 .",
    "second bob applies @xmath51 to @xmath38 as is usual for a quantum teleportation . in these steps ,",
    "alice s bell measurement on @xmath70 prior to controllers measurements does not affect bob s operation to recover the phase appearing as a result of controllers measurements .",

    "there are two practical ways among many @xcite .",
    "one is the matrix in the form @xmath106 with @xmath107 the @xmath108 identity matrix and @xmath109 a @xmath110 strictly totally positive matrix @xcite .",
    "any minor of @xmath109 is nonzero positive from the definition of strict total positivity ; hence any @xmath8 rows of @xmath82 build up a square matrix with nonzero determinant .",

    "a drawback is the difficulty to find a strictly totally positive matrix @xmath109 for sufficiently small prime @xmath7 .",
    "a known systematic construction @xcite for strictly totally positive matrices uses the largest element of @xmath109 growing exponentially in @xmath112 .",
    "thus @xmath7 also grows exponentially if we follow the construction .",
    "a manual optimization is indispensable .",
    "the other is a vandermonde matrix used in the well - known shamir s scheme @xcite , @xmath113 with mutually different @xmath114 s with prime @xmath2 .",
    "( @xmath2 is necessary to set @xmath114 s mutually different . )",
    "striking @xmath97 rows generates a square vandermonde matrix and it is non - singular when @xmath114 s are mutually different ( see , e.g. , pages 43 and 219 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . hence a matrix equation with @xmath115 can be used for the threshold scheme .",
    "this matrix has been known to be economical because @xmath7 increases linearly in @xmath5 .",
    "each qudit distributed to a controller should have the dimension @xmath4 , consequently .",
    "nevertheless , one may need to further reduce the dimension considering the poor resources of presently available qudit systems @xcite .",
    "the dimension of each digit distributed to a party ( a controller in the present context ) is often evaluated by using the scale of `` bit length '' in conventional secret sharing schemes .",
    "each key is @xmath116-bit long @xcite ( @xmath11-bit long @xcite ) in the best known protocols for a short secret with the bit length @xmath116 ( for a long secret with the bit length @xmath11 ) although this has not been taken as a drawback at all since classical bits are very cheap .",
    "nevertheless , in quantum protocols one should not consume many qubits for individual quantum systems .",
    "it is of our concern to find a smaller dimension for each controller s qudit facing a limited resource of a quantum system .",
    "one way is to abandon the use of quantum systems for controllers portion and instead use a classical threshold scheme to control a quantum teleportation .",
    "a controlled teleportation proposed by zhang and man @xcite , in the context of @xmath13 threshold , uses classical keys shared by alice and controllers for encoding alice s messages , which can be easily extended to a general threshold - control scheme . here",
    ", we introduce a different scheme where controllers qudits are simply replaced by classical digits .",
    "we will face the fact that classical control schemes are indeed economical but their security is based on classical keys .",
    "using qudits is found to be more robust against bob s physical - access attack .",
    "our interest is to find such a robust scheme with a simple quantum state for the controllers portion .",
    "it is shown to be constructed by using the matrix equation with the vandermonde matrix ( [ vmatrix ] ) and qubit states distributed to the controllers .",
    "we further perform an economization in the number of bob s operations , which is useful for an extension in which multiple epr channels are under controllers control .",
    "as we mentioned , the simplest way of economization is to use classical control digits instead of quantum ones .",
    "this is easily achieved by setting the state ( not a state , actually ) of the controllers portion to be a scalar @xmath117 with phase @xmath118 dependent on integers @xmath65 , the classical keys of a certain classical threshold scheme .",
    "bob can modify this scalar factor by applying @xmath119 $ ] to his @xmath15th qubit @xmath38 if he can gather at least @xmath8 of the keys .    the security of the scheme is dependent on the classical scheme . indeed",
    ", classical keys can be securely distributed by using a quantum key distribution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and the risk of an interception during the key distribution is negligible .",
    "classical keys are , however , easily copied by careless controllers .",
    "a possible drawback of the scheme is that controllers can not stop bob from recovering alice s original state if bob manages to obtain at least @xmath8 of the keys without consent of the controllers .",
    "in contrast , in a threshold scheme using qudits , the operations for a recovery of the original state are unfixed until @xmath8 controllers make measurements .",
    "this fact makes the quantum one more robust : recall that the computational basis for @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eqqss ] ) is not necessarily known in public .",
    "the correct basis for a measurement can be left unknown to bob .",
    "then , bob can not obtain @xmath105 by a physical access to @xmath44 unless he also has an access to the information on the measurement basis .",
    "thus the cost for bob to steal @xmath105 s in the scheme is more than that in the classically controlled one .",
    "this logic is similar to the one utilized for keeping the security of dealer - player communications in some quantum threshold schemes @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that robustness depends on the type of protocol violations .",
    "let us discuss a different type of violation that can be made by bob .",
    "it is a common occasion that controllers do not want bob to process further with a teleported state before they officially vote for their decision .",
    "a violation in this regard occurs when @xmath8 or more controllers are friendly to bob and they measure their qudits or digits and send the outcomes before the voting starts officially .",
    "this violation in the schedule of the procedure can not be prevented even if qudits are distributed .    in the following ,",
    "an economical quantum control scheme is introduced in order to reduce the resource for controllers quantum system as we have mentioned .",
    "it is now our additional motivation to resolve the schedule violation problem due to friendly controllers .",
    "as is discussed above , a quantum threshold scheme has a classically unachievable property , namely that the operations for a recovery of the original state are unfixed until controllers make measurements and the measurement bases can be left unnotified to bob . as we have mentioned , our aim is to achieve such a scheme using small - dimensional systems for controllers portions . here , we propose a quantum protocol for the @xmath0-threshold controlled quantum teleportation with @xmath5 qubits distributed to the controllers .",

    "the teleportation process involves @xmath15 bell measurements performed by alice and @xmath5 single - qubit measurements performed by controllers .",
    "it also involves bob s recovery operations : ( i ) at most @xmath173 single - qubit operations corresponding to alice s measurement outcomes ; ( ii ) @xmath5 single qubit operations [ on average , ( @xmath174 ) single - qubit operations ] corresponding to controllers measurement outcomes when the protocol described in sec .",
    "[ seceqcqt ] is employed [ when that in sec .  [ secebo ]",

    "[ secebo ] , the operations of ( ii ) reduce to a single operation in reality for the present setup while it does not for the setup of fig .",
    "we have proposed an economical scheme for a @xmath0-threshold control of a quantum teleportation .",
    "it uses a shared state of alice , bob , and controllers with the controllers portion in the state of eq.([econkappa ] ) , which consists of qubits only .",
    "thus a drawback of a usual polynomial coding , namely , the required dimension @xmath175 for each controller s qudit , has been resolved .",
    "in addition , it is straightforward to extend the scheme so that multiple qubits in bob s portion are under the threshold control .",
    "our economical scheme can be seen as a hybrid of a standard @xmath13-threshold controlled quantum teleportation and a @xmath0-threshold classically - controlled quantum teleportation , as we have mentioned in sec .",
    "[ seceqcqt ] .",
    "it should be noted that this has been realized by a nontrivial protocol using the state ( [ econkappa ] ) .",
    "the scheme has a good redundancy for the securement of the @xmath0 threshold : ( i ) to modify the phase factors owing to controllers measurements , @xmath8 or more classical keys are required for bob .",
    "( ii ) to make disagreeing controllers perform measurements , at most ( @xmath131 ) solicits should be sent from bob .",
    "in fact , the standard controlled teleportation in the context of @xmath13 threshold can be used in the context of @xmath0 threshold by stating only ( ii ) in its protocol .",
    "the advantage of our economical scheme over this simple extension is , thus , the redundant securement .",
    "the scheme is , however , not as economical as a classically - controlled quantum teleportation , as we have discussed in sec .",
    "[ secccqt ] .",
    "a quantum threshold - control scheme is certainly more expensive than a classical threshold - control scheme .",
    "it is thus recommended to assess the trade - off between the benefit and the economicalness to choose an appropriate scheme .",
    "the benefit to distribute qudits ( qubits in our scheme ) among controllers is to make the recovery operation of bob unfixed unless controllers make measurements .",
    "this makes the protocol robust against bob s attack to the keys : in order for cheating , he needs both physical accesses to at least @xmath8 controllers qudits and information on their measurement bases .",
    "one may however claim that careless controllers tend to lose both of them at once in a real world .",
    "our economical scheme possesses a clearer advantage also : it can prevent a violation of a voting schedule , i.e. it can prevent bob from recovering the original state before an official voting time , unless controllers violate the schedule all together .",
    "there is one drawback in our protocol . in case",
    "we use the scheme of sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , controllers who disagree to the teleportation do not have to measure their systems .",
    "in contrast , in our economical protocol , a disagreeing controller has to measure her / his qubit if a solicit is sent from bob .",
    "our protocol can be broken by a controller who does not follow this regulation .",
    "it seems an important drawback at a glance , but there is a quick solution : one can easily find out which controller cheats in the protocol .",
    "any controller who does not send a measurement outcome despite a solicit sent from noncheating bob is a cheater .",
    "a clever cheater , however , may report an opposite measurement outcome and/or a wrong key instead of being quiet .",
    "it has been well - known that a basic secret sharing is not robust against dishonest participants who report wrong keys .",
    "there have been several proposals to remedy this drawback in classical secret sharing schemes @xcite .",
    "these classical schemes are easily combined into our scheme in order to find cheating in the keys @xmath105 , as is clear from the protocol . nevertheless , a protocol to find cheaters sending wrong messages as measurement outcomes should be newly constructed .",
    "one way to achieve this task is to add a supercontroller who grasps controllers states by entangling her / his systems and their corresponding systems .",
    "let the supercontroller know their measurement bases .",
    "then the supercontroller can check the measurement outcomes afterward .",
    "it is hoped that a more sophisticated way will be developed .",
    "finally , we discuss a well - known strategy to use controlled quantum teleportation as a secret sharing to hide a quantum state as a secret @xcite .",
    "any ( @xmath176)-threshold controlled quantum teleportation in the stage after alice s bell measurements is regarded as a ( @xmath176)-threshold quantum secret sharing : alice s original state to be recovered in bob s side is regarded as a secret and the controllers are regarded as participants sharing the secret .",
    "a drawback of this approach is that the original state is recovered in the system of bob s side ; participants who try to cooperate for recovery should gather at this side or ask a dealer for proxy .    a solution to avoid this drawback is to construct @xmath5 initially identical copies of the entire system @xmath177 for the ( @xmath176)-threshold controlled quantum teleportation , where @xmath178 . let us write a copy as @xmath179 with @xmath180 . we send the system @xmath181 , together with classical information obtained by the bell measurements on each of @xmath182 , to the @xmath183th participant ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the @xmath183th participant should also receive @xmath185 , namely the @xmath183th control systems of all @xmath186 s .",
    "the @xmath183th participant can recover the original state in the system @xmath181 when she / he gets to know the measurement results on @xmath8 or more among @xmath187 , including her / his own , and corresponding classical keys if they are used in the scheme .",
    "this approach possesses the following benefit .",
    "the original quantum secret sharing is limited to @xmath188 due to the no - cloning theorem when an unknown quantum state is a secret @xcite . a controlled quantum teleportation with a ( @xmath176)-threshold control is not limited by the no - cloning theorem because the secret , namely , alice s original state , is teleported to bob s system .",
    "the approach is practical when we use classical keys for controlling a quantum teleportation .",
    "the resource required for this case is @xmath5 classical keys and @xmath5 copies of the system that consists of @xmath15 epr pairs and the @xmath15-qubit original state .",
    "of course , the @xmath5 copies of the system are reduced to one copy in case participants may gather in a particular place or may use a trusted dealer for proxy .",
    "there seems to be no serious drawback of using classical control because the classical keys can be securely distributed and a scheduled vote is not interposed usually for a secret sharing .",
    "the robustness of our economical scheme is effective when an untrusted bob exists .",
    "this is due to the fact that the measurement basis of each controller can be hidden . in this sense",
    ", our economical scheme might be used for a secret sharing to build in robustness against physical access attacks by malicious participants who try to cheat . nevertheless , it is not attractive to spend many epr pairs despite the reduction in the resource for controllers portion .",
    "a choice of a proper scheme is dependent on the demand of participants when a controlled quantum teleportation is applied to a secret sharing .",
    "we have discussed the advantage and disadvantage of our scheme in which the dimension of each controller s qudit is reduced to two .",
    "this reduction is indeed significant for physical realization of the threshold control of a quantum teleportation . nevertheless , it is controversial as to which extent a controlled quantum teleportation should be performed with quantum resources .",
    "the answer depends on the application and as to which party is trusted , as is clear from the above discussions .",
    "we have proposed an economical protocol for @xmath0-threshold controlled quantum teleportation .",
    "this protocol uses qubits distributed to controllers ; hence we have achieved the reduction in the dimension of each qudit from a prime @xmath2 to two .",
