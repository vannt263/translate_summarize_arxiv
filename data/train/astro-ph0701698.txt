    "it is the only source in the power - law sample with a spectroscopic redshift that is not detected in x - rays , and it lacks a 24  counterpart ( see  5.2 ) .",

    "comparisons between the number of red ( @xmath27 ) and blue ( @xmath46 ) sources in the full irac sample , however , will be complicated by these effects , as the 5.8  limiting flux increases with increasing spectral slope , reducing the number of blue sources that meet the requirements of the power - law sample .    to minimize the chances of selecting non - active galaxies via the power - law selection , we compared the spiral galaxy templates from devriendt et al .",

    "none of the sources in the final sample are well - fit by a spiral template .",
    "in addition to contamination from local spiral galaxies , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 )  found that cool ulirgs at @xmath47 and with @xmath48 could appear as power - law galaxies .",

    "seven of these sources , however , have x - ray counterparts , and all but one ( a source with no redshift estimate ) have x - ray luminosities of log  @xmath8(ergs  s@xmath9)@xmath50 , and are therefore unlikely to be starburst - powered ulirgs .",
    "we further explore the possibility of contamination due to star - forming galaxies in  6.2.2 , using several updated seds , described in detail in appendix a.    we have also considered whether the contributions of 3.3 ( @xmath51 ) and 6.2  ( @xmath52 ) aromatic emission features to the flux in the irac 8.0  band could create the appearance of a red power - law continuum .",
    "observations of starbursts detect these aromatic features to equivalent widths of @xmath53  and @xmath54 , respectively ( risaliti et al .",
    "2006 ; b. r. brandl et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "due to the large bandpass of the 8.0  irac channel , however , the 3.3 and 6.2  emission features should have at most a 3% or 20% effect , respectively , on the total flux . ( the models of devriendt",
    "1999 ) predict a slightly larger ( 20% ) effect due to the 3.3  feature ( stern et al . 2005 ) ) .",

    "these outliers could also be explained , however , by a compton - thick absorber that obscures the mid - ir so strongly that the output in this range is dominated by star formation in the host galaxies .",

    "while the power - law sample defined here accounts for only @xmath76 of the x - ray and mir - detected agn in the comparison sample , approximately 50% of the high - redshift x - ray sample are power - law galaxies .",

    "the 24  detection fraction of agn in the comparison sample increases with x - ray luminosity . because we require all power - law galaxies  to be detected in each of the four irac bands , the 24  detection fraction is almost certainly higher than would be expected for an unbiased sample of agn .",

    "further exploration of a possible systematic difference in the radio properties of the two samples would be interesting . while there is very little overlap between the radio - excess and power - law samples , both have similarly low x - ray detection fractions , suggesting that this may be a common feature of agn selected independently of their x - ray and optical properties , regardless of redshift or luminosity . *",

    "the references in table a4 provide total - galaxy flux densities in the optical , near infrared , and at 3.6 and 4.5 .",

    "they have the advantage of being consistently calibrated , are not affected by terrestrial atmospheric absorption , and they extend to 5.5 .",
    "specifically , we used the spectrum of @xmath244 and for the near infrared stellar continuum , since its co absorption approximately matches that of actively star forming galaxies . at wavelengths shortward of 1.2 ,",
    "our starting point was the spectral energy distribution of arp 220 from silva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for each galaxy , we joined these two spectra at 1.2  and then adjusted the normalization and reddening to give a good overall fit through the photometry ( ubvr as available plus jhk ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum was taken as the stellar photospheric part of the template ( since we need a template valid up to z = 3 in the irac 3.6  band , the behavior at wavelengths shortward of 0.8  is unimportant ) . from goldader",
    "et al . ( 1995 ) , all three galaxies have strong co stellar absorption features ( bandhead at rest 2.3 ) , so the photospheric spectrum is not significantly diluted by other sources at least to 2.4 . therefore",
    ", we use it to define the template from 0.8 to 2.4 .    for wavelengths longer than about 6 ,",
    "the templates are based on the spectra listed in table a4 . because the infrared activity is generally concentrated in the nuclei , and the beams used for these spectra are relatively large , we made no corrections for extended emission .",
    "to bridge from 2.4 to 6 , we proceeded as follows .",
    "the irac photometry at 3.6 and 4.5  matches the apertures for the 2mass total galaxy measurements , so it defines the overall output across the bridge region .",
    "the spectrum of m82 ( strm et al . 2000 ) indicates that we should expect no strong spectral features between 4 and 6  ( other than br @xmath147 , which should have small equivalent width ) . to fold in the 3 - 4 region",
    ", we used the spectra indicated in table a4 .",
    "we estimated the photospheric contribution to these spectra by applying corrections to our stellar template from small aperture photometry in the jhk region , or from small aperture photometry at l , or from both .",
    "this contribution was subtracted from the spectrum ( using the @xmath244 and template ) and the remainder , representing the excess emission , was added to the total stellar template .",
    "this excess spectrum was scaled until the total template matched the photometric point at 3.6 ( the scaling factors required were small , between 1 and 1.5 , indicating that the excess emission was nearly all within the @xmath104 1 \" slits used for the spectroscopy ) .",
    "we joined the longest wavelength point from these spectra to the shortest wavelength point in the 6 - 15  spectra with a scaled and adjusted spectrum from m82 ( sturm et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we found that adjusting the slope as a power law in wavelength and then normalizing gave a smooth connection that also was compatible with the photometry at 4.5 .",
