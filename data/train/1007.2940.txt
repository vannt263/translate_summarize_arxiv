    "hst _ observations were obviously required .",
    "our proposal to reobserve psrb1055@xmath052  with _ hst _ was accepted for cycle 16 ( program 11154 ) .",

    "the sbc is a csi multi - anode microchannel array ( mama ) photon - counting detector , which is operated in accum mode producing time - integrated images .",
    "the detector is sensitive to radiation in the 11151700   wavelength range , and it provides a nominal field of view ( fov ) of @xmath33 , with a pixel scale of @xmath34 . to filter out the geocoronal lines , we used the longpass filter f140lp ( pivot wavelength @xmath35  ; equivalent gaussian fwhm @xmath36  ) , which cuts off radiation at @xmath37  .",
    "the pulsar was observed on 2008 february 13 over two consecutive spacecraft orbits for a total integration time of 5569 s. the data were reduced and calibrated ( including the linearity correction , dark subtraction , flat - fielding ) through the acs data reduction pipeline ( calacs ) , using the closest - in - time calibration frames .",
    "geometric distortion correction , cosmic - ray filtering , and exposure stacking were applied during the pipeline processing using the multidrizzle task .",

    "we also observed psrb1055@xmath052  in three optical bands with the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on 2008 march 8 . to exploit the maximum spatial resolution ,",
    "the pulsar was centred in the planetary camera ( pc ) chip , which has a pixel scale of @xmath39 and a fov of @xmath40 . to maximize the spectral coverage , we observed through the f450w ( @xmath41  ; @xmath42  ) , f555w ( @xmath43  ; @xmath44  ) , and f702w ( @xmath45  ; @xmath46  ) filters .",
    "observations were carried out during four consecutive orbits for the total integration times of 3600 s in the f450w filter and 1800 s in each of the f555w and f702w filters . for each filter , the observations were split in shorter , dithered exposures of 600 s to filter out cosmic ray hits and bad pixels .",
    "the data were processed through the wfpc2  calwp2 reduction pipeline for bias , dark , and flat - field correction and flux calibration . for each filter , we then combined single exposures with the iraf task drizzle to produce co - added and cosmic - ray - free images .",
    "we also used the archival foc observations by m+97 .",
    "they were carried out on 1996 may 11 in the f342w filter ( @xmath47  ; @xmath48  ) during three spacecraft orbits with the exposure times of 2771 s for the first orbit and 3062 s for the second and third orbits , corresponding to the total integration time of 8895 s. the data were obtained with the high - resolution f/96 relay , with the fov of @xmath49 and pixel scale of 0014 .",

    "the most recent published radio coordinates of psrb1055@xmath052   ( newton et al .  1981 ) , @xmath50 are for the epoch of 1978.13 ( equinox j2000 ) .",
    "these coordinates , without proper motion values , are reported in the atnf radio pulsar catalogue ( manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) , and they were also used by weltevrede et al .  ( 2010 ) to compute the psrb1055@xmath052  radio ephemeris for the timing of the _ fermi _ @xmath2-ray observations .",
    "since pulsars are known to have high velocities , psrb1055@xmath052  could move a few arcseconds in the 30 year span between the epochs of the radio position and our _ hst",
    "_  observations ( 2008.12 and 2008.18 ) .",
    "for instance , for an average radio pulsar velocity of 400 km s@xmath11 ( e.g. , hobbs et al .",
    "2005 ) , we would expect a proper motion of @xmath51 mas  yr@xmath11 and a position shift of @xmath52 in 30 years , in an unknown direction .",
    "such an uncertainty hampers a direct identification based on the pulsar s position only .",
    "fortunately , the presence of star a in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar can be used for the pulsar identification .",
    "the @xmath53 cutout of the sbc image of the psrb1055@xmath052  field ( left panel of figure 1 ) shows the only two objects detected in the entire sbc fov , separated by a distance of 441 . from the comparison of this image with that obtained by m+97 with foc",
    ", it is natural to assume that the northwestern and southeastern objects are star a and the candidate pulsar counterpart , respectively .",
    "indeed , the nominal sbc coordinates of the northwestern source are @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the most accurate coordinates of star a , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , at the epoch of our _ hst _ observation , can be derived from the third us naval observatory ccd astrograph catalog ( ucac3 ; zacharias et al .",
    "2010 ) , with account for the star a s proper motion , @xmath58 mas yr@xmath11 and @xmath59 mas yr@xmath11 , given in the same catalog and independently verified by us ( see appendix ) . as the difference between these and the nominal sbc coordinates ( 057 and @xmath60 in right ascension and declination , respectively ) is within the error budget of the _ hst _ absolute astrometry , we conclude that the sbc northwestern source is indeed star a.    applying the boresight correction to the sbc image , such that the coordinates of the northwestern source coincide with the ucac3 coordinates of star a",
    ", we obtain the following coordinates of the southeastern source @xmath61 with a nominal position uncertainty of about @xmath62 .",
    "this uncertainty is mostly determined by the uncertainty of the ucac3 absolute astrometry , thanks to the small angular distance ( 441 ) between star a and psrb1055@xmath052 , and the @xmath63 accuracy on the _ hst _  roll angle with respect to the equatorial reference frame .",
    "the derived position is consistent with the candidate pulsar counterpart position in the foc observation ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , within the uncertainty of the foc position ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "after 2002 , the guide stars are selected from the gsc2.3  ( lasker et al .",
    "2008 ) , which has an improved mean positional error of about @xmath67 . ] and the uncertainty caused by an unknown proper motion since the epoch of the foc observation ( 1996.36 ) .",
    "this suggests that we indeed detected the psrb1055@xmath052  candidate counterpart of m+97 in our sbc image , while the extremely blue color ( obvious from the comparison of the fuv ( sbc ) image with the optical ( foc and wfpc2 ) images ; see figure 1 and also section 3.2 ) virtually proves that this object is indeed psrb1055@xmath052 .",
    "using the offsets between the pulsar counterpart and star a measured in the sbc image ( 202 and @xmath68 in right ascension and declination , respectively ) , we looked for the pulsar counterpart at the corresponding position in the wfpc2 images .",
    "we detected it in both the f702w image ( seen in the circle labeled `` sbc '' in the right panel of figure 1 ) and in the f555w image but not in the f450w one .",
    "we measured the magnitudes and fluxes of the psrb1055@xmath052   counterpart in the wfpc2 , acs / sbc , and foc images through customized aperture photometry using the iraf package digiphot . for the wfpc2 f555w and f702w bands",
    ", we used a small source aperture with the radius @xmath69 pixels ( 0135 ) to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we sampled the background in a surrounding annulus with the inner radius @xmath71 pixels and radial width @xmath72 pixels ; the distance of 2 pixels from the source aperture was chosen to exclude the brighter portion of the point spread function ( psf ) wings .",
    "we then applied the aperture correction using the fractional encircled energy ( fee ) coefficients ( holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) , and the correction to compensate for the time- and position - dependent charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) losses of the wfpc2  detector ( dolphin 2009 ) . for estimating the @xmath73 flux upper limit in the f450w band",
    ", we used the same @xmath69 pixels source aperture but sampled the background in a wider annulus , @xmath74 pixels , around the expected pulsar position .",
    "for the sbc data , we chose a source aperture of @xmath75 pixels ( 02 ) and a background annulus with @xmath76 pixels and @xmath77 pixels .",
    "the large radial distance of 14 pixels between the source aperture and the background annulus was chosen to exclude the count excess over the psf wings , which is seen from the comparison of the count distributions around the pulsar and around star a ( see the insets in the left panel of figure 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath78 excess ( e.g. , @xmath79 counts in the 0307 annulus ) can not be ascribed to different psfs of the pulsar and star a because the latter is only one magnitude brighter than the pulsar in the sbc f140lp band , and it is separated from the pulsar by only 441 . from these data",
    "alone , we can not exclude the possibility that the excess is a compact pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , but , as the excess is not seen in other bands , it can also be just a small - scale enhancement of the detector background at the pulsar position . since the brightness profile of star a is closer to that of the model psf , we used it as a reference to compute the aperture correction by fitting its growth curve ( i.e. , the number of source counts within an aperture as a function of its radius ) .",
    "we also measured anew the magnitude and flux of the counterpart in the foc image .",
    "following the approach described by pavlov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we chose an optimal source aperture from the measured growth curves for each of the three orbits .",
    "we found that the growth curves for the first and third orbits were consistent with each other and compatible with the nominal values of fee at @xmath80  , while the growth curve for the second orbit showed a peculiar behavior ( e.g. , no saturation up to @xmath81 pixels , which means an unusually broad psf ) .",
    "therefore , we excluded the second orbit data from the analysis and chose @xmath82 pixels ( 011 ) , @xmath83 pixels , and @xmath77 pixels .    in all cases",
    ", we applied the countrate - to - flux conversion by computing the photometric zero points in the stmag system using the image keywords photflam and photzpt , derived by the _ hst _",
    "data reduction pipelines . to calculate the extinction - corrected fluxes , we estimated the interstellar reddening toward the pulsar , @xmath84 , using the hydrogen column density @xmath85 @xmath86 , derived by de luca et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from the x - ray fits , and using the correlation between @xmath87 and @xmath88 found by predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) .",
    "we then calculated the extinction coefficients using the optical extinction curves by fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) for the wfpc2  and foc passbands and the uv extinction curves by seaton ( 1979 ) for the sbc passband .",
    "the magnitudes and the measured , @xmath89 , and dereddened , @xmath90 , spectral fluxes are presented in the last two columns of table [ mag ] .",
    "we plotted the dereddened spectral fluxes @xmath90 versus frequency @xmath91 in figure 2 .",
    "the shape of the broadband spectrum and , in particular , the relatively high fuv brightness of the object are inconsistent with it being a non - collapsed star in the galaxy or an extragalactic object .",
    "therefore , the photometry proves unequivocally that the source is the optical counterpart of psrb1055@xmath052 .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that a simple one - component spectral model can not fit the optical - uv spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "however , similar to the optical - uv spectra of other middle - aged pulsars ( e.g. , kp07 ) , the sed can be fitted by a model consisting of an ( optical ) power - law ( pl@xmath3 ) component and a rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) component : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the radius of equivalent emitting sphere , and @xmath94 is the brightness temperature ( both as seen by a distant observer ) . at @xmath84 ,",
    "the fitting parameters are @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xmath97jy at @xmath98 hz , and @xmath99 km@xmath100 mk ( or @xmath101 mk , where @xmath8 is the radius in units of 13 km ) .",
    "the pl@xmath3 component , which can be interpreted as magnetospheric radiation , dominates in the optical ( @xmath102  ) .",
    "the energy flux of this component is @xmath103 erg @xmath86 s@xmath11 in the 30009000   band .",
    "the rj component dominates in the fuv and is likely emitted from the ns surface .",
    "we will discuss implications of these results in section 4.1 .",
    "the pulsar counterpart position given by equation ( 2 ) was obtained from the sbc astromery using the star a position in the ucac3 catalog . of course , using just one reference star may introduce a significant bias in the absolute target position .",
    "fortunately , the wfpc2 has a much larger fov than the sbc , allowing astrometry with larger numbers of reference stars .    for the wfpc2 astrometry",
    ", we used two catalogs , gsc2.3   ( lasker et al . 2008 ) and 2mass ( skrutskie",
    "although the astrometric accuracy of these catalogs is somewhat lower than that of ucac3 , they contain more stars per given area , which improves the statistics of the astrometric fits .",
    "moreover , most ucac3 stars identified in the wfpc2 fov are saturated , which prevents their use for the astrometric calibration .",
    "we used the f702w image , in which psrb1055@xmath052  was detected with a higher @xmath70 than in the f555w image .",
    "we produced the wfpc2 mosaic image with the stsdas task wmosaic , which also corrects for the geometric distortion .",
    "then , we measured the centroids of the reference stars ( 13 stars in gsc2.3  and 16 stars in 2mass ) in the wfpc2 pixel coordinates through gaussian fitting with the graphical astronomy and image analysis ( gaia ) tool and used the catalog sky coordinates of these stars to compute the pixel - to - sky coordinate transformation with the code astrom .",
    "this yielded astrometric fits with the rms values @xmath104 for both the gsc2.3  and 2mass stars . to these we added in quadrature the uncertainties of the registration of the wfpc2  image on the catalog reference frames , @xmath105 and 008 , for the gsc2.3  and 2mass , respectively . following lattanzi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , these uncertainties were estimated as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 accounts for 3 free parameters in the astrometric fit , @xmath108 is the mean positional error of the catalog coordinates ( 03 and 02 for the gsc2.3  and 2mass , respectively ) , and @xmath109 is the number of catalog stars used to compute the astrometric solution .",
    "accounting for the 015 and 0015 uncertainties on the link of the gsc2.3  and 2mass to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf ) , the overall uncertainties of the astrometry ( @xmath110 position errors ) are @xmath111 and 019 , respectively .",
    "we applied these astrometric solutions to compute the sky coordinates of psrb1055@xmath052  from its pixel coordinates .",
    "as it has been done for the reference stars , we computed the pixel coordinates through a gaussian fitting , with an uncertainty of @xmath112 for the pulsar centroid , negligible in comparison with the overall uncertainty of our absolute astrometry calibration .",
    "we then obtained the gsc2.3-based pulsar coordinates @xmath113 with the position error @xmath111 , and the 2mass - based coordinates @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "these two positions are consistent with each other and with the ucac3-based position derived by using star a as the only reference star in the sbc astrometry ( equation 2 ) .",
    "since the coordinates in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) have been computed using different catalogs and different reference stars , they can be considered independent and hence can be averaged .",
    "the calculation of the weighted means yields @xmath116 with @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the wfpc2 astrometry , re - calibrated with the gsc2.3  and 2mass , has provided the absolute pulsar coordinates at the epoch of 2008.18 , which is separated by about 30 years from the epoch of the only published radio position .",
    "we used the optical coordinates of psrb1055@xmath052   to measure its proper motion from the comparison with the radio coordinates at the 1978.13 epoch ( equation 1 ) .",
    "we note that , since the gsc2.3  and 2mass , as well as ucac3 , are linked to the icrf , there is no a systematic offset between the optical and radio coordinates .",
    "using equation ( 6 ) , we infer the displacement @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which corresponds to the proper motion @xmath120 in right ascenscion and declination . using the ucac3-based positions ( equation 2 ) results in virtually the same proper motion ( @xmath121 mas yr@xmath11 , @xmath122 mas yr@xmath11 ) , whose errors",
    "are dominated by the errors of the radio position ( equation 1 ) .",
    "the pulsar proper motion can be independently measured through _ relative _ _ hst _ astrometry , by comparing its position with respect to star a in the sbc image ( epoch 2008.12 ) with that in the foc image ( epoch 1996.36 ) .",
    "of course , measuring a relative proper motion with only one reference star comes with caveats .",
    "firstly , star a is slightly saturated in the foc image and part of its psf is outside the foc fov ( see figure 1 of m+97 ) , which lowers the precision of the star centroid determination .",
    "to be very conservative , we assumed an uncertainty of 5 pixels ( 007 ) .",
    "the pulsar centroids were measured with a much higher precision of @xmath123 pixels in both the sbc and foc images ( @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively ) , and the residual geometric distortion ( about 0004 and 0007 rms for the sbc and foc , respectively  see apellniz & cox 2008 and nota et al .",
    "1996 , respectively ) is also much smaller than the foc centroiding uncertainty for star a.    secondly , with only one reference star , we have to rely upon the nominal values of the angles between the detector axes and the directions of right ascension and declination , which may introduce an error in the direction of the proper motion .",
    "however , this error is very small in our case , thanks to the accuracy of the detector position angle and the small separation of star a from the pulsar ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "last but not least , the uncertainty of the proper motion of the reference star should be small enough not to hamper the measurement of the relative pulsar proper motion",
    ". we carefully verified it for star a ( see appendix ) .    using the value of the pixel scale for the two detectors and the nominal orientations of the two images with respect to the equatorial reference frame",
    ", we found the displacement of the pulsar with respect to star a during the time span of 11.76 years between the two _ hst _  observations : @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the uncertainty of the displacement is dominated by the large uncertainty of the star a centroid in the foc image .",
    "this displacement corresponds to the proper motion @xmath128 mas yr@xmath11 and @xmath129 mas yr@xmath11 . correcting these values for the proper motion of star a as given in the ucac3 catalog ( see  3.1 ) , we obtained @xmath130 this proper motion agrees with that measured from the comparison of the radio and optical absolute coordinates .",
    "the weighted mean of the proper motion values determined by the two methods is @xmath131 or @xmath132 for the total proper motion and position angle ( counted east of north ) .",
    "the large proper motion provides additional evidence that the m+07 candidate is indeed the pulsar counterpart .",
    "we have shown in section 3.2 that the optical - uv sed for psrb1055@xmath052   can be described by a sum of pl@xmath3 ( magnetospheric ) and rj ( thermal ) spectra ( see equation 3 ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare these optical components with the corresponding spectral components at higher energies , particularly in soft x - rays where both the thermal and magnetospheric components are seen .",
    "as we have mentioned in section 1 , the pulsar s x - ray spectrum can be described by a model that consists of cold bb ( bb@xmath133 ) , hot bb ( bb@xmath134 ) , and x - ray power - law ( pl@xmath135 ) components .",
    "the bb@xmath133 and bb@xmath134 components are presumably emitted from the bulk of the ns surface and polar caps , respectively , while the pl@xmath135 component , @xmath136 , represents the magnetospheric x - ray emission .",
    "the parameters of the three components , as inferred from the _ xmm - newton _  data by de luca et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , are the following : @xmath137 mk , @xmath138 km ; @xmath139 mk , @xmath140 km ; and @xmath141 , @xmath142 erg @xmath86 s@xmath11 hz@xmath11 at @xmath143 kev , respectively . these components and their extrapolations into the optical - uv domain are shown in the left panel of figure 3 .",
    "we see from figure 3 that the extension of the best - fit pl@xmath135 component into the optical overshoots the optical fluxes by a factor of @xmath144 3 , similar to most of other pulsars detected in the optical ( e.g. , kp07 ; mignani et al .",
    "however , in contrast to the majority of those pulsars , the pl@xmath3 component is apparently steeper than the pl@xmath135 component ( @xmath145 vs.  @xmath141 ) , and perhaps steeper than the pl@xmath3 components in other pulsars ( e.g. , @xmath146 and @xmath147 in psr b0656 + 14 and geminga , respectively ; see kp07 ) .",
    "moreover , the extrapolation of the best - fit pl@xmath3 component into the x - ray range does not intersect the pl@xmath135 spectrum , being at least a factor of @xmath148 lower at @xmath149 kev .",
    "such behavior is unusual ( a notable exception is psr b054069 ; mignani et al .  2010 ) , and it might suggest that different populations of ultrarelativistic electrons are responsible for the optical and x - ray emission of psrb1055@xmath052 . however , taking into account the large uncertainties of the spectral slopes , it seems more plausible that @xmath150 is substantially smaller than its best - fit value ( e.g. , @xmath151 ) , in which case the extrapolation of the pl@xmath3 component can , in fact , be smoothly connected with the pl@xmath135 spectrum .",
    "interestingly , the slope @xmath152 of the _ fermi _ lat spectrum , fit by a pl with an exponential cutoff ( @xmath153 ; abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) , is even flatter than the x - ray slope . on the other hand ,",
    "as we see from the right panel of figure 3 , the optical and @xmath2-ray points can be connected by a pl spectrum with the slope @xmath154 , which , however , goes slightly above the pl tail of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that further observations ( especially in the ir - optical ) , supplemented by a joint multiwavelength analysis , will show the magnetospheric spectrum of psrb1055@xmath052   to be similar to those of other pulsars with optical , x - ray , and @xmath2-ray counterparts , including the other two musketeers .",
    "another property of psrb1055@xmath052  to compare with those of other pulsars detected in the optical is the relationship between the optical and x - ray luminosities of the magnetospheric emission .",
    "for instance , for the wavelength range 40009000  , the flux in the pl@xmath3 component , @xmath155 erg @xmath86 s@xmath11 , corresponds to the luminosity @xmath156 erg s@xmath11 and optical efficiency @xmath157 . at the adopted distance of 750 pc ,",
    "both the luminosity and efficiency of psrb1055@xmath052  are considerably higher than those of psr b0656 + 14 and geminga , for which @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 , @xmath161 , respectively ( kp07 ) .",
    "this hints that the actual distance to psrb1055@xmath052  is smaller , which is supported by the analysis of the thermal emission below . on the other hand , the ratio of the optical ( 40009000  ) and x - ray ( 110 kev ) nonthermal luminosities , @xmath162 ( which does not depend on the distance ) ,",
    "is within the same range of @xmath163@xmath164 as for all other pulsars with optical counterparts ( zavlin & pavlov 2004 ; zharikov et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "let us now compare the optical - uv and x - ray _ thermal _ components of the psrb1055@xmath052  spectrum .",
    "the bb@xmath134 component is not seen in the optical because of the small emitting area , while the extrapolation of the bb@xmath133 into the optical - uv is a factor of @xmath165 below the observed rj component .",
    "such an `` optical - uv excess '' of the rj component has been seen in the nearby radio - quiet isolated nss ( rqinss ) , such as rxj1856.53754 and rxj0720.43125 ( e.g. , kaplan 2008 , and references therein ) , and in the millisecond pulsar j0437@xmath04715 ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "it , however , has not been observed in middle - aged pulsars . in particular , the extrapolated bb@xmath133 component lies slightly _ above _ the optical - uv rj component in geminga ( kargaltsev et al .",
    "2005 ) , while these components virtually coincide with each other in psr b0656 + 14 ( kp07 ) .",
    "the nature of the optical - uv excess is not fully understood ; a popular hypothesis is that it is due to a nonuniform distribution of the temperature over the ns surface , such that the bb@xmath133 component originates from a smaller and hotter region than the optical - uv rj component ( e.g. , pavlov et al .",
    "2002 ) . such an assumption is crudely equivalent to adding a `` very cold '' thermal component , bb@xmath166 , which dominates in the uv but makes very little contribution in x - rays .",
    "in other words , the product @xmath167 in the second term of equation ( 3 ) is approximately equal to @xmath168 . taking into account that @xmath169 km@xmath100 mk and @xmath170 km@xmath100 mk , we obtain @xmath171 km@xmath100 mk ( or @xmath172 mk ) .",
    "unfortunately , we can not measure @xmath173 independent of @xmath174 in the rj regime .",
    "we can , however , estimate an upper limit on @xmath173 from the requirement that the bb@xmath166 spectral flux extrapolated to soft x - ray energies becomes so small , in comparison with the bb@xmath133 , that it does not affect the x - ray fit .",
    "we found that it occurs at @xmath175 mk ( at this temperature the contribution of the bb@xmath166 flux is @xmath176 above 0.3 kev  see figure 3 , left ) .",
    "such a limit on @xmath173 implies a considerably smaller distance to the pulsar than that estimated from the pulsar s dispersion measure .",
    "indeed , from the above estimate on @xmath177 we obtain @xmath178 pc , where we took into account that @xmath179 is smaller than the ns radius , @xmath180 km . since the ns radius ( as seen from infinity ) can hardly exceed 20 km , the distance is @xmath181 pc , and it can even be substantially smaller than this upper limit .",
    "we should note that such estimates are , of course , model dependent .",
    "for instance , the temperature distribution over the ns surface can be smooth ( i.e. , there are no three distinct regions as we implicitly assumed above ) .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of the thermal emission from a ns surface region can differ from the bb , which may lead to an excess of the actually emitted optical - uv thermal component over the extrapolation of the x - ray thermal component even if the surface temperature is uniform ( e.g. , in the case of a light - element , h or he , ns atmosphere ; pavlov et al .",
    "however , fitting the model light - element atmosphere spectra to the observed x - ray spectrum always leads to a lower temperature and a larger value of @xmath182 ( i.e. , to a smaller distance at a given ns radius ) than those obtained from the bb fits ( pavlov et al .",
    "therefore , it seems hard to avoid the conclusion on a smaller distance pc ; brisken et al .",
    "2003 ) for psr b0656 + 14 .",
    "interestingly , anderson et al .  ( 1993 ) estimated the distance to be @xmath183 pc using the ns atmosphere models by shibanov et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and _ rosat _ data . ] , although its value can not be determined accurately from the data available .",
    "we believe 200 pc and 500 pc are reasonable lower and upper limits , and we will scale the distance to 350 pc below .",
    "the conclusion that the distance is smaller than previously thought has important implications .",
    "for instance , the radius of the bb@xmath133 emitting region , @xmath184 km , becomes substantially smaller than a plausible ns radius .",
    "it means that @xmath185 mk is _ not _ the temperature of the entire ns surface , and it should _ not _ be used for comparisons with the ns cooling models .",
    "this removes the problem of psrb1055@xmath052  being too hot and luminous ( @xmath186 erg s@xmath11 ) for its age , in comparison with other middle - aged nss and the predictions of standard ns cooling models ( e.g. , yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) .",
    "it also means that psrb1055@xmath052  is not a `` very slowly cooling ns '' ( as suggested by kaminker et al .",
    "2002 ) , and there is no need to invoke an unusually low ns mass to explain its thermal emission ( see yakovlev & pethick 2004 for references ) . to infer the true thermal luminosity and average surface temperature , and compare them with the predictions of the ns cooling models , the parallax - based distance to the pulsar should be measured , and the distribution of the temperature over the ns surface should be determined from the phase - resolved spectral analysis of the pulsar s soft x - ray and fuv emission .",
    "another implication of the smaller distance is that the magnetospheric luminosities and efficiencies in various spectral bands are lower than previously thought , being close to the luminosities and efficiencies of other pulsars .",
    "for instance , if @xmath187 pc , its @xmath2-ray efficiency , @xmath188 in the 0.1100 gev band ( abdo et al .",
    "2010 ) , although still rather high , becomes not so different from the efficiencies of other pulsars detected with _",
    "lat , and the optical efficiency , @xmath189 , becomes comparable with those of psrb0656 + 14 and geminga .",
    "psrb1055@xmath052   is the third rotation - powered pulsar , after geminga ( caraveo et al .",
    "1998 ) and psrb0540@xmath069 ( mignani et al .  2010 ) , for which an absolute position has been determined with a sub - arcsecond accuracy using optical astrometry techniques .",
    "knowing the astrometric position will be useful for the precise timing analysis of the pulsar .",
    "the proper motion we measured for the pulsar s optical counterpart ( equation 11 ) corresponds to a tangential velocity @xmath190 km s@xmath11 .",
    "this value is well below the average 400 km s@xmath11 for radio pulsars ( hobbs et al .",
    "2005 ) , but it is close to that of the vela pulsar ( @xmath191 km s@xmath11 ; caraveo et al .",
    "2001 ) .    the proper motion in galactic coordinates",
    ", @xmath192 shows that the pulsar , whose current coordinates are @xmath193 and @xmath194 , is moving away from the galactic plane .",
    "we attempted to use the proper motion to locate the pulsar s birth place , identify a parent star cluster ( ob association ) , and estimate the actual age of the pulsar that can differ from its spin - down age .",
    "however , to calculate the pulsar s trajectory back in time in the galactic potential , one should know the present distance ( which is poorly known ) , the tangential velocity ( proportional to the distance ) , and the radial velocity @xmath195 ( which is unknown ) .",
    "therefore , one has to calculate a large set of pulsar trajectories for various values of @xmath196 and @xmath195 . using the code developed by vande putte et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , we calculated the trajectories on a grid of 21 distances ( in the range of 200 to 1200 pc ) and 21 radial velocities ( @xmath197 to @xmath198 km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "we also selected a sample of young ( @xmath199 myr ) clusters / associations ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "1999 ; dias et al .",
    "2002 ) in a @xmath200 radius circle around the present position of the pulsar , extrapolated back in time their motion using the same code , and looked for closest approaches of the pulsar and cluster trajectories .",
    "the results , however , turned out to be rather ambiguous because different values of @xmath196 and ( especially ) @xmath195 resulted in quite different candidate parent associations and pulsar ages ( e.g. , we found 10 candidates for the age range of 400700 kyr ) , and the uncertainty of @xmath201 propagated back in time resulted in very large uncertainties on the minimum separations .",
    "these uncertainties becomes even larger if one also accounts for the errors on the cluster proper motions , distances , and radial velocities . to obtain a more certain solution",
    ", we have to wait for the measurement of the pulsar s parallax and more accurate measurements of the proper motion , together with observational constraints on the pulsar s radial velocity , which could come , e.g. from the modelling of a possible bow - shock pwn created in the ism by the supersonically moving pulsar ( see , e.g. pellizza et al .",
    "using the _ hst _  observations , we have confirmed that the candidate proposed by m+97 is indeed the optical - uv counterpart of psrb1055@xmath052 , the tenth rotation - powered pulsar with a secured optical identification ( see mignani 2010 for a recent review ) . from multi - band photometry we found that , similar to the middle - aged pulsars psr b0656 + 14 and geminga , its spectrum can be described by the combination of a pl@xmath3 component , with the spectral index @xmath5 , and a rj component , with brightness temperature @xmath202 mk . the pl@xmath3 component is steeper than those of psrb0656 + 14 and geminga and , possibly , of all the other rotation - powered pulsars with known optical counterparts .",
    "moreover , it is possibly steeper than the x - ray pl component , which might suggest that different populations of relativistic electrons are responsible for the x - ray and optical - uv magnetospheric emission . to verify this assumption , ir observations of psrb1055@xmath052",
    "would be particularly useful , supplemented by a joint spectral fit of the ir - optical , x - ray , and @xmath2-ray components , using multiwavelength spectral models for magnetospheric pulsar emission .",
    "the observed rj component exceeds by a factor of @xmath2034 the extrapolation of the x - ray thermal component into the uv - optical , unlike psrb0656 + 14 and geminga but similar to rqinss .",
    "it indicates that the temperature distribution over the ns surface is nonuniform , and the x - ray thermal component comes from a relatively small hotter region , while the main contribution to the optical - uv rj component comes from a larger and colder area .",
    "it implies that the distance to the pulsar is considerably smaller than estimated from the pulsar s dispersion measure and the models for galactic electron distribution .",
    "it also means that the conclusions inferred from the comparison of the x - ray temperature and thermal luminosity of psrb1055@xmath052  with the ns cooling models require a revision .",
    "observations in the uv and near - ir , including phase - resolved spectroscopy , are required to separate the thermal and magnetospheric components and infer the temperature distribution , while the measurement of the radio parallax is crucial to determine the actual distance and the ns radius .    by recalibrating the astrometry of the _ hst _",
