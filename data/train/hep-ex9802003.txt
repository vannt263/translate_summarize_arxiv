    "two electron beams after the final focus system are traveling toward the interaction point ( ip ) . at a distance of about 0.11 cm upstream from the ip , at the conversion point ( c ) ,",
    "the laser beam is focused and compton backscattered by electrons , resulting in the high energy beam of photons . with reasonable laser parameters one can `` convert '' most of the electrons into high energy photons .",
    "the photon beam follows the original electron direction of motion with a small angular spread of the order @xmath2 , arriving at the ip tightly focused , where it collides with a similar opposing high energy photon beam or with an electron beam .",

    "the physics in high energy ,  colliders is very rich .",
    "the total number of papers devoted to this subject exceeds one thousand .",

    "can be presented :    1 .",
    "some phenomena can be better studied at photon colliders than with pp or  collisions , for example , the measurement of the two - photon decay width of the higgs boson . due the loop diagrams ,",
    "all massive ( even ultra - heavy ) charged particles contribute to this width if their mass is originated by the higgs mechanism . some higgs decay modes and",
    "its mass can be measured at  colliders better than in  or pp collisions ( see the next section ) .",
    "cross sections for production of charged scalar , lepton and top pairs in  collisions are larger than those in  collisions approximately by a factor of 5 ( see fig .   [ fig16 ] ) ; for ww production , this factor is even larger , about 1020 .",
    "3 .   in  collisions ,",
    "charged supersymmetric particles with masses higher than in  collisions can be produced ( a heavy charged particle plus a light neutral ) , collisions also provide higher accessible masses for particles which are produced as a single resonance in  collisions ( such as the higgs ) .    these examples together with the fact that the luminosity in collisions is potentially higher than that in  collisions ( see sect .",
    "4 ) are very strong arguments in favor of photon colliders .",
    "[ fig16 ]    a typical distribution of  or   luminosity on the invariant mass has high energy peaks at the maximum masses with widths @xmath4 , @xmath5@xcite .",
    "below the high energy peak , there is usually a flat part of the luminosity distribution with 110 times larger total luminosity ( depending on details of the collision scheme ) .",
    "statistics equal to that in  collisons , can be achieved in collisions with much smaller ( at least by a factor of five ) luminosity .",
    "of course , in any case data in  and  collisions are complimentary to each other because the coresponding diagrams are different ) .",
    "search and study of the higgs boson , the key particle of the standard model , is one of the primary goals of linear colliders .",
    "the lep-2 will put the lower limit on its mass ot about 95 gev . indirectly , from radiative corrections , it follows that the higgs mass ( if the standard model is correct ) is @xmath6 gev  @xcite .",
    "the mssm predicts a mass of the lightest neutral higgs less of than 130 gev .",
    "so , the mass of the higgs most probably lies in the region of 100@xmath7300 gev . some parameters of the sm higgs ( total width , width , and main branching ratios ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ hbranch]@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "higgs production in  collisions has been considered in many papers .",
    "unfortunately , different authors have used their own definitions of the  luminosity which often led to underestimation of the expected number of events for a given integrated  luminosity . in the present paper , we will directly compare the higgs production cross sections in  and  collisions .",
    "i would like also to pay attention to some additional possibilities for higgs studies at photon colliders connected with a very sharp edge in the  luminosity spectra .",
    "[ 1 . ]   width ( thick lines ) are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    [ 1 . ]",
    "width ( thick lines ) are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=233 ]    the total higgs width at masses below 400 gev is much smaller than the characteristic width of  luminosity spectra ( fwhm @xmath9 ) , therefore the production rate is proportional to @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the photon helicity . below",
    "we assume that the higgs search and study is done utilizing the high energy peak of the  luminosity energy spectrum .",
    "the effective cross section for @xmath13 and @xmath14 is presented in fig .",
    "[ cross ] .",
    "note that here is defined as the  luminosity at the high energy luminosity peak ( @xmath15 for @xmath16 ) , thus ignoring the lower energy part of the luminosity spectrum , which is much less valuable for experiment .",
    "is lower ( no peak and a wider energy range ) and we have much larger backgrounds ( @xmath17 , etc ) , worse polarization degree ( partially due to contribution of multiple compton scattering and unpolarized beamstrahlung photons ) and , consequently , worse suppression of backgrounds ; therefore , the required total integrated luminosity will be only larger than in the method of scanning ( this statement should be checked more carefully ) .",
    "if the higgs mass is already known , then , obviously , one has to work at @xmath18 . ]",
    "this luminosity is approximately equal to @xmath19 . for comparison , in the same figure",
    "the cross sections of the higgs production in  collisions is shown .",
    "we see that for @xmath20 100250 gev the effective cross section in collisions is larger than that in  collisions by a factor of about 530 . this",
    "interesting fact has never been emphasized .",
    "how do we study the higgs in  collisions ?",
    "one obvious way is searching for a peak in the invariant mass distribution measured by the detector .",
    "this is the only method utilizing the broad luminosity spectrum .",
    "the mass resolution in this method can be somewhat better than the width of the high energy luminosity peak .",
    "another method is the energy scanning where we can use some important features of the  luminosity distribution : quite narrow width of high energy peak and a _ very sharp edge of luminosity distribution _ which is much narrower than the width of the luminosity peak and the detector resolution , see fig . [ edge ] .",
    "for @xmath16 the differential luminosity ( @xmath21 ) reaches half of its maximum at @xmath22 ( at @xmath23 ) . during the scanning",
    ", we will observe a sharp increase in the visible cross section when the maximum energy of the  collider reaches @xmath24 ( if the higgs is a very narrow resonance ) .",
    "observation of a step at the same energy for different decay modes significantly increases confidence of results , especially for modes with small branchings or with difficulties in reconstruction .",
    "for example , detection of the @xmath25 decay is a difficult task due to undetected neutrinos . the most reliable way to see",
    "this channel is to observe a step in visible cross section for events with the following selection criteria : two collinear low - multiplicity jets with unbalanced transverse momentum and with the energy of one jet not far from the maximum photon energy .",
    "the total number of events for 10 fb@xmath26 of integrated luminosity ( as it was defined above ) for the case when the peak of the luminosity spectrum sits at the higgs boson mass is 13000 ( 18000 ) for @xmath24 = 130 ( 150 ) gev respectively ( follows from cross section given in fig .",
    "[ cross ] ) .",

    "photon colliders also allow to measure the higgs mass with a high precision .",
    "the very sharp edge of the luminosity spectrum and high statistics make it possible to obtain a much better accuracy than in  or pp collisions . in this measurement",
    ", it is important to remember that nonlinear effects in the conversion region can shift the maximum energy of compton photons and change the shape of the luminosity spectrum  @xcite . to reduce this effect ,",
    "the parameter @xmath54 characterizing nonlinearity should be kept small enough .",
    "the shape of the luminosity spectrum near @xmath55 should be measured very precisely using the processes @xmath56 .    as we have seen",
    ", the higgs can be very successfully studied in collisions for @xmath24 = 100350 gev , may be even better than in  collisions .",
    "due to the absence of beamstrahlung , beams in  collisions can have much smaller horizontal beam size than in  collisions , thus the beta functions at the interaction point can be made as small as possible ( some restrictions are imposed by the oide effect connected with chromatic aberrations due to synchrotron radiation in the final quads ) . however , even after optimization of the final focusing system the attainable  luminosity in curent lc projects is determined by the attainable `` geometric '' ee  luminosity .",
    "the results of simulations for different projects are the following .",
    "for the `` nominal '' beam parameters ( the same as in  collisions ) and the optimum final focus system the luminosity @xmath57  for nlc / tesla / sblc , or by about factor 5 smaller than  luminosity .    obviously , this is not a fundamental limit .",
    "below we will discuss what the limit really is and how to approach it .",
    "the only collision effect restricting  luminosity at photon colliders is the coherent pair creation which leads to the conversion of a high energy photon into  pair in the field of the opposing electron beam  @xcite .",
    "there are three ways to avoid this effect : a ) use flat beams ; b ) deflect the electron beam after conversion at a sufficiently large distance from the ip ; c ) under certain conditions ( low beam energy , long bunches ) the beam field at the ip is below the critical one due to the repulsion of electron beams  @xcite .",
    "the problem of ultimate luminosities for different beam parameters and energies was analyzed recently in ref.@xcite analytically and by simulation .",
    "the resume is following .",
    "the maximum luminosity is attained when the conversion point is situated as close as possible to the ip , at @xmath58 $ ] cm ( here the second term is equal to the minimum length of the conversion region ) . in this case , the vertical radius of the photon beam at the ip is also minimal : @xmath59 ( assuming that the vertical size of the electron beam is even smaller ) . the optimal horizontal beam size ( @xmath60 ) depends on the beam energy , the number of particles in a bunch and the bunch length .",
    "the dependence of the  luminosity on @xmath60 for various energies and numbers of particles per bunch is shown in fig .",
    "the bunch length is fixed at 0.2 mm .",
    "the collision rate is calculated from the total beam power , which is equal to 15e[tev ] mw ( close to that in current projects ) . from the fig .",
    "[ sb3 ] we see that at low energies and small numbers of particles , the luminosity curves follow their natural behavior @xmath61 , while at high energies and large numbers of particles per bunch the curves make a zigzag which is explained by @xmath62  conversion in the field of the opposing beam .",
    "what is so remarkable about these results ?",
    "first of all , the maximum attainable luminosities are huge , above @xmath63 . at low energies",
    ", there is no coherent pair creation , even for a very small @xmath60 s , when the field in the beam is much higher than the critical field @xmath64 .",
    "this is explained by the fact that during the collision the beams are repulsing each other so that the field on the beam axis ( which affects high energy photons ) is below the critical field .",
    "it means that the @xmath0 luminosity is simply proportional to the geometric electron - electron luminosity ( approximately @xmath65 ) for @xmath66 nm . for energies",
    "2e@xmath67 2 tev , which are in reach of the next generation of linear colliders , the luminosity limit is much higher than it is usually required and much higher than in  collisions ( especially at low energies ) .",
    "one of the main problems in obtaining such high  luminosity is generation of electron beams with small emittances in both horizontal and vertical directions . in the following sections we will discuss various approaches to solving this problems .",
    "there are several possibilities for increasing luminosity .",
    "\\1 ) reduction of the horizontal emittance by optimizing the damping rings . for example , at the tesla , a decrease of  by a factor of 3.5 leads to an increase in  up to @xmath68 .",
    "however , it seems that this way is quite difficult .",
    "\\2 ) one can use low emittance rf - photoguns instead of damping rings . unfortunately ,",
    "even with the best photoguns the luminosity will be somewhat lower than that with damping rings .",
    "however , there is one possible solution .",
    "the normalized emittance in photoguns is approximately proportional to the number of particles in the electron bunch .",
    "it seems possible to merge ( using some difference in energies ) many ( @xmath69 ) low current beams with low emittances to one high current beam with the same transverse emittance .",
    "this gives us a gain in luminosity more than by a factor of @xmath70 in comparison with a single photogun ( `` more '' because the lower emittance allows smaller beta functions due to the oide effect ) .",
    "estimations show that with ten photoguns , one can achieve  @xmath71 in all considered projects .",
    "there is only one `` small '' problem : such rf - guns with polarized electrons do not exist yet , though there are no visible fundamental problems  @xcite .",
    "also there is the `` thermal '' limit on emittance in photoguns , which puts some restrictions on this method . in the asga photoguns with polarized electrons ,",
    "this limit should be much smaller than for metal photocathodes  @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) if one has flat electron beams ( @xmath72 ) from some injector ( a damping ring or , better , an rf - gun ) , then it is possible , in principle , to make exchange of the horizonlal and longitudinal emittances using an off - axis rf cavity ( some head - tail kick arizing here can be removed by additional rf cavities rotated by 90@xmath73 .",
    "this method was never tested or even discussed .",
    "i do not know why .",
    "this method is especially promising for beams from rf - guns , where very small energy spread allows both horizontal and longitudinal beam compression .",
    "this method as well as the previous one should be studied more carefully .",
    "\\4 ) for a considerable step up in luminosity , beams with much lower emittances are required . that needs development of new approaches , such as _ laser cooling _",
    "@xcite ( see next subsection ) .",
    "potentially , this method allows to attain a geometric luminosity by two orders higher than that achievable by other known methods .",
    "recently  @xcite , a new method of beam production with small emittance was considered  laser cooling of electron beams  which allows , in principle , to reach @xmath74 .",
    "the idea of laser cooling of electron beams is very simple . during a collision with optical laser photons ( in the case of strong fields it is more appropriate to consider the interaction of an electron with an electromagnetic wave ) the transverse distribution of electrons ( @xmath75 ) remains almost the same .",
    "also , the angular spread ( @xmath76 ) is almost constant , because electrons loss momenta almost along their trajectory ( photons follow the initial electron trajectory with a small additional spread ) .",
    "so , the emittance @xmath77 remains almost unchanged .",
    "at the same time , the electron energy decreases from @xmath78 down to @xmath79 .",
    "this means that the transverse normalized emittances have decreased : @xmath80 .",
    "one can reaccelerate the electrons up to the initial energy and repeat the procedure . then after n stages of cooling @xmath81 ( if  is far from its limit ) .",
    "some possible set of parameters for laser cooling is : @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 mm , @xmath84 , flash energy @xmath85 j. the final electron bunch will have an energy of 0.45  with an energy spread @xmath86 , the normalized emittances , are reduced by a factor of 10 .",
    "a two - stage system with the same parameters reduces the emittances by a factor of 100 .",
    "the limit on the final emittance is @xmath87 m  rad at @xmath88 . for comparison , in the tesla ( nlc ) project",
    "the damping rings have @xmath89 m  rad , @xmath90 m  rad .",
    "this method requires a laser system even more powerful than that for e @xmath91 conversion .",
    "however , all the requirements are reasonable , taking into account the fast progress of laser technique and time plans of linear colliders . multiple use of the laser bunch ( some optical resonator ) can considerably reduce the required average laser power .",
    "this method can be tested already now at a low repeatition rate .",
