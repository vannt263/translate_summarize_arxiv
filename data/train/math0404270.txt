    "in @xcite , garoufalidis and kricker introduced a powerful invariant @xmath0 which is a lift of the kontsevich integral to a space spanned by trivalent graphs whose edges are colored by elements of @xmath4 $ ] , at least when the alexander polynomial vanishes . in this note",
    "we calculate how @xmath0 behaves when evaluated on the boundary of a grope . a grope ( of class @xmath5 )",
    "is a specific @xmath6-complex that topologically models an element of the @xmath5th term of the lower central series of a group .",
    "it is formed by gluing together surfaces called _ stages . _",
    "some examples are pictured in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "[ rational ] let @xmath7 be an embedded grope of class @xmath1 @xmath8 in @xmath9 which has one boundary component , is of class @xmath1 , and has surface stages of genus one .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the unknot .",
    "then    * @xmath11 vanishes in euler degree below @xmath2 .",

    "this will imply that the kontsevich integral of @xmath16 vanishes in degree @xmath17 and that @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the subspace of @xmath20 spanned by connected graphs with two hairs on a single edge .",
    "moreover we will show every element of @xmath19 is realized for some @xmath7 . since one can easily show that @xmath21 using an @xmath22 weight system , we achieve the following results , at least when the ambient manifold is @xmath9 .",
    "( these were both proven in @xcite with a lot more effort . )",
    "[ vassiliev ] let @xmath7 be an embedded genus one grope of class @xmath1 in a homology @xmath23-sphere ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "* rational - valued goussarov - vassiliev invariants of degree @xmath17 do not distinguish @xmath25 from the unknot @xmath10 .",
    "* there exists a goussarov - vassiliev invariant , @xmath26 , of degree @xmath27 and a grope @xmath7 of class @xmath1 such that @xmath28 .",
    "the case of arbitrary homology spheres follows easily from the @xmath9 case , as we show at the end of the paper .",
    "we conclude by emphasizing the fact that this note deals with knots that bound gropes , which is a more restricted class than those cobounding a grope with the unknot , as studied in @xcite .",
    "we briefly review some properties of @xmath0 here .",
    "this is distilled from @xcite , which is further distilled from @xcite .",
    "we restrict to the case of knots with trivial alexander polynomial , since knots which bound gropes of class @xmath29 have that property .",
    "let @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "then a @xmath31-colored graph is a trivalent graph together with a map @xmath32 .",
    "( a coloring of an edge is sometimes called a bead . )",
    "then @xmath33 is a vector space generated by @xmath31-colored graphs , modulo certain relations .",
    "this space is graded by the euler degree which is the number of vertices of the graph .",
    "letting @xmath41 be the degree @xmath1 part of @xmath0 , we will use the fact that @xmath41 is a universal @xmath42-valued finite type invariant of null degree @xmath1 .",
    "that is , it is universal with respect to null clasper surgeries , which are clasper surgeries whose leaves link the knot trivially .",
    "so @xmath0 vanishes on alternating sums of surgeries of null claspers of total degree @xmath43 , and its value on alternating sums of null - claspers of total degree @xmath1 is given by the so - called _ complete contraction _ , defined by gluing the leaves together using the equivariant linking number , and coloring an edge by a @xmath35 or @xmath44 every time it passes through a fixed seifert surface .",
    "the equivariant linking number of two leaves which are meridians to dual bands of a seifert surface is @xmath3 .",
    "more generally , suppose that one leaf is a meridian to a band of a seifert surface and another leaf links only the dual band with linking number @xmath45",
    ". then the equivariant linking number of these two leaves is @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the equivariant linking number of leaves which are null homotopic in the complement of a seifert surface is just the standard linking number .",
    "suppose a knot bounds an embedded grope of class @xmath1 in @xmath9 , where all the surface stages are of genus one",
    ". then the knot can be represented as a rooted tree clasper surgery , @xmath47 , in the complement of the unknot which forms a meridian to the root leaf @xcite .",
    "note that the other leaves can be embedded arbitrarily in the complement of the unknot s spanning disk .",
    "break @xmath47 into a union of a @xmath48 at its root and a clasper @xmath49 which sits on the unknot @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath49 is a null clasper of euler degree @xmath2 .",
    "the complete contraction @xmath51 is defined by thinking of @xmath49 as a unitrivalent tree and gluing up its leaves using the equivariant linking form .",
    "one of the two dual bands of @xmath50 has exactly one leaf of @xmath49 as a meridian .",
    "( because the grope is of class exceeding @xmath6 . )",
    "the equivariant linking number of this leaf with any leaf that links the dual band is an integral multiple of @xmath3 . for every other pair of leaves",
    "the equivariant linking numbers are integers .",
    "thus @xmath52 is a sum of trivalent graphs of euler degree @xmath2 which have a bead @xmath3 on a single edge . by the universality of @xmath0",
    ", we have that @xmath53 , and that @xmath54          note that any terms of @xmath0 of euler degree exceeding @xmath2 must have at least two hairs and so be of vassiliev degree exceeding @xmath27 .",
    "thus there are no terms with vassiliev degree less than or equal to @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "observe that @xmath61 as claimed . to see that every element of @xmath19 is realized ,",
    "take a generator @xmath62 .",
    "remove one of the two hairs and embed @xmath63 as a rooted clasper on the unknot . breaking some edges of @xmath63 into hopf pairs of leaves",
    "we get a rooted clasper with @xmath1 leaves as desired .",
    "this can be detected using an @xmath22 weight system ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) .",
    "this weight system satisfies two relations .",
    "any closed loop gives a multiplicative factor of @xmath23 , whereas an edge can be expanded into a difference of two terms , where the edge is removed and replaced either by two parallel edges , or by two edges which cross .          which consists of an ellipse with @xmath64 parallel vertical edges and two hairs .",
    "we show it is nonzero by showing that the diagram formed by joining the two univalent vertices is nonzero .",
    "the resulting diagram is an ellipse with @xmath59 parallel edges added .",
    "applying the @xmath22 relations to these @xmath59 edges , starting from the right , we get down to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a single circle . hence our diagram evaluates to @xmath67 .",
    "we have already established theorem 1 for knots in @xmath9 .",
    "any homology sphere , @xmath68 , can be obtained from @xmath9 by surgery on a disjoint union of @xmath48 claspers . by general position",
    ", we may assume that the clasper @xmath47 corresponding to our grope is disjoint from these claspers .",
    "letting @xmath49 denote the clasper formed by surgering the unknot along the @xmath48 containing the root , we see that modulo euler degree @xmath43 we can pull @xmath49 into a ball",
