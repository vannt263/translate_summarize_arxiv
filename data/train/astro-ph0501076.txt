    "2001 ; peterson et al .",
    "2003 ; bhringer et al .",
    "2002 ) . in our case , fitting a cooling - flow model to the global spectrum does not give a better fit than a two - phase model , but the temperature profile does suggest a cooling flow .",
    "another interesting possibility is that we are observing the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the early type galaxy .",
    "indeed our  observation maps x - rays only within the optical envelope of the galaxy . a clear indication in favour of this interpretation is given by the metallicity profile .",
    "we are not able to map individual elements with the current data , but the fitted metallicity should be dominated by the iron abundance .",
    "the  metallicity profile clearly shows a decline from the centre outwards , which can also be seen as a break at @xmath148 kpc , with an average global relative abundance of @xmath149 within this radius and @xmath99=0.37 outside .",
    "work based on asca data found that clusters harbouring cd galaxies display a significant increase in metal abundance towards the centre ( e.g. fukuzawa et al . 2000 ; matsushita et al .",
    "similar results were found with bepposax data ( e.g. de grandi & molendi 2001 ) , and suggest that this is due to metal enrichment by sn type ia in the cds ( e.g. finoguenov & ponman 1999 , matsushita et al . 2002 , 2003 ) . the optical galaxy that we associate with , mcg-01 - 12 - 005 , is not well studied and it is not catalogued as a cd galaxy . however , this interpretation is still plausible , since prior to the advent of   it was almost impossible to map in such detail the inner regions of galaxy clusters , and objects without the striking optical properties of cd galaxies are just starting to be discussed .",

    "( 2003 ) for early type galaxies , adding another piece of support to the ism interpretation for the x - ray emission within 40 kpc of this object .",
    "while the temperature increases rapidly after the first bin , and at 40 kpc it is already @xmath152 kev which is too high for the atmosphere of a galaxy , we note that the metallicity and temperature profiles could change independently with different radial functions because of the different physics associated with the transport of heavy ions outwards and thermal energy inwards .",
    "we also note that the gas is consistent with a two - phase metallicity , with a value close to solar within 35 arcsec and close to a common value for galaxy clusters beyond 35 arcsec .",
    "this suggests that little mixing between the ism and icm has occurred .",
    "we can use the comparison between the radio source and the ambient medium properties to map the formation history of the core of .",
    "we find that the gas entropy declines continuously towards the centre , in agreement with recent results on galaxy groups and clusters ( e.g. ponman , sanderson & finoguenov 2003 ; pratt & arnaud 2003 ; khosroshahi , jones & ponman 2004 , pratt & arnaud 2004 ) , typically of the same temperature as .",
    "moreover , the large - scale radial dependence of the entropy we measure is in agreement with both analytical models of spherical collapse , and numerical simulations based solely on gravitational collapse ( tozzi & norman , 2001 , borgani et al .",
    "2001 , voit et al .",
    "it does seem that there is or there has been some modification of the core entropy of this cluster ( galaxy ) .",
    "this is seen in the radial dependence of the entropy , where a simple power - law fit gives a shallower slope than expected from pure shock heating , and where a power law plus constant model is clearly a better fit .",
    "however there is no flat isentropic core ( entropy plateau ) .",
    "the deviation of other classical scaling laws , such as the @xmath153 relation ( e.g. arnaud & evrard 1999 ) , from the prediction of purely gravitational models has suggested that some extra heating has occurred .",
    "it has been proposed that sources at the centres of clusters ( such as agn or radio galaxies ) could cause this heating ( e.g. valageas & silk 1999 ; wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ; churazov et al .",
    "2002 ; ruszkowski & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "the small core in the entropy distribution of this object would suggest that entropy has been modified in some way , and the central radio source , although weak , may be a plausible candidate for this modification ( e.g. roychowdhury et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "an alternative observational indication is given by the comparison between the radio and x - ray luminosity in the cooling region , which should be similar , once a reasonable factor for the conversion between power and radio emission is assumed .",
    "the radio source at the centre of  is particularly small .",
    "the radio luminosity is of order @xmath154 erg s@xmath5 , while the x - ray luminosity of the soft thermal component within 35 arcsec is @xmath151 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "if only 0.1% of the total power output goes into the radio emission , then the rest of the power can heat the gas .",
    "however , this is a rather low efficiency for conversion of the source power into radio emission , and also a high efficiency for heating . from this evidence",
    ", it is unlikely that the radio source is supplying sufficient heat to stop any cooling flow .",
    "since we do not have an independent measure of the magnetic field , we assumed equipartition , yielding the result that the minimum internal pressure of the source is about a factor of 2 lower that the external pressure . the minimum pressure is a lower limit ,",
    "thus we are facing two possibilities for the small size of the source : the radio source is old and is dying , or the radio source is young .    in the first case ,",
    "the source was bigger and more powerful in the past .",
    "it may have heated the external medium which is now hotter than at the origin , as can be inferred from the relative distribution of hard and soft emission in the core of  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) .",
    "it is also possible that the source inflated bubbles of rising gas , carrying energy and pressure , as observed for example in m87 ( e.g ghizzardi et al .",
    "however , radio sources are short - lived ( 10@xmath155 yr ) and when they are starved of fuel they lose power",
    ". if this is the scenario we are observing , the radio source should be relatively old , and is in its fading phase .",
    "hints in favour of this picture are the small size of the radio source , the distribution of the hard emission in the central 5 arcsec ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hr ] ) , the small entropy core , and the relatively large external pressure at the location of the radio galaxy .",
    "we can not constrain the spatial distribution of the hard emission , which is strongly limited by the statistics .",
    "it is unlikely that the hard emission is non - thermal , since high energy electrons can not live longer than their parent population .",
    "thus it is possible that what we are observing is the signature of gas heating .",
    "the second possibility is that the source is young .",
    "the engine has just turned on and the source is expanding .",
    "this would explain i ) the low surface brightness of the gas at the location of the radio source , and ii ) the high surface brightness just outside it .",
    "this can be interpreted as an expanding source which is pushing the ambient gas away .",
    "if the source is young then it may not have had time to affect the entropy of the gas , which could explain the relatively small heating signatures in the entropy profile .",
    "the  observation of  shows that a bl lac object is absent and we observe an extended , cluster - scale source , which was previously discussed by edge & stewart ( 1991 ) .",
    "the central x - ray emission is likely to be due to the ism of the early - type galaxy at the centre of the cluster , and only at @xmath143 kpc does the icm dominate over the ism .",
    "the central x - ray emission was little affected by heating in the way observed for other low - temperature clusters .",
    "if the source is relatively young , our results represent indirect support for models where agn activity in the central galaxy may be cause of the breakdown of self - similarity .",
