    "the spatial power spectrum of the hi 21 cm intensity in the small magellanic cloud was obtained by stanimirovic ( 1999 ) .",
    "interestingly , it is a power law over scales as large as that of the smc itself .",
    "similar power laws have been observed by crovisier & dickey ( 1983 ) and by green ( 1993 ) in the galaxy .",
    "the outstanding feature in the case of the smc is the large scale of the observed correlations .",
    "the power laws signal underlying long range correlations in what looks like a field of random fluctuations of the intensity . for an optically thin medium along the line of sight , the 21 cm intensity is proportional to the column density",
    ". therefore , the fluctuations in 21 cm intensity , represent fluctuations in density .",
    "a natural interpretation of the observed power spectra is that the underlying correlations in density fluctuations are due to a turbulence in which velocity fluctuations , that are coupled to density fluctuations , give rise to the observed power laws .",
    "the turbulence interpretation was suggested by goldman ( 2000 ) and stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) .",
    "goldman ( 2000 ) suggested that this large scale turbulence was generated by instabilities in the bulk flows that resulted from the tidal interaction during the last close passage of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xmath0 ago ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) .",
    "however , since the observations catch a snapshot of the intensity field and since the turbulence timescales are very long ( @xmath1gyr ) one can not rule out the possibility of a _",
    "static _ correlated density field that reflects initial conditions .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a test to decide between these two alternatives .",
    "staveley - smith ( 1997 ) observed 501 hi super shells in the smc .",
    "the proposed test relies on the fact that the timescale and age of the turbulence ( if indeed there ) are typically @xmath2 orders of magnitude larger than the lifetimes of the super shells .",
    "therefore , they have formed in the turbulent gas and their observed radial velocities should reflect the turbulent velocity field in the gas in which they where formed .",
    "we wish to look at them as markers registering the ambient gas velocity .",
    "if the radial velocity field exhibits spatial correlations consistent with the those of the turbulence , assumed as responsible for the 21 cm intensity spectra , it will strengthen the case for dynamical turbulence as the source of the hi intensity power spectrum .",
    "we use the data of the 501 super shells reported in table 1 of staveley - smith ( 1997 ) . for each super shell",
    ", the residual radial velocity was found by subtracting from the observed velocity the large scale best fit , up to a shear .",
    "@xmath3    with @xmath4 where @xmath5    the coordinates of each shell @xmath6 are in units of pc and were obtained from the angular coordinates by adapting a distance of 60 kpc to the smc .",
    "the velocities are in units of km / s .",
    "the subtracted large scale velocity field is composed of a mean velocity and a shear .",
    "the magnitude of the shear is consistent with values obtained by gardiner & noguchi ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have computed the second order structure function and the autocorrelation for the residual velocity field along lines parallel to the coordinate axes .",
    "interpolation was used to fit the discrete data along the lines to a continuous function .",
    "the different lines yielded similar results .    for simplicity",
    ", homogeneous and isotropic velocity field is assumed . in this case , the structure function and the autocorrelation depend only on the distance between the two points , @xmath7 .",
    "the structure function is    @xmath8    similarly , the autocorrelation function is    @xmath9    the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging .",
    "assuming ergodicity , in addition to homogeneity and isotropy , ensemble averaging equals space averaging .",
    "as stated above , we use averages over lines so that    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the length of the line . similarly , @xmath12 the results of a typical computation are presented in figures 1 - 2 .",
    "figure 1 shows the structure function @xmath13 . for very small values of @xmath14 @xmath15 , for larger values of @xmath14",
    "it varies as @xmath16 and then it saturates .",
    "the index @xmath17 characterizes the inertial range of the turbulent velocity spectral function : @xmath18 . in kolmogorov turbulence characterizing incompressible fluid @xmath19 . in the case of turbulence in compressible medium @xmath20",
    "this was also the value deduced by goldman ( 2000 ) on the basis of the 21 cm intensity power spectrum .",
    "these two power lows are presented in figure 1 .",
    "the precision of the data is not enough to decide between them , even though the @xmath20 line seems to follow better the slope of the computed structure function .",
    "as function of scale in pc",
    ". the thin lines have slopes @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the upper line has a slope of @xmath21 . ]",
    "the autocorrelation function is shown in figure 2 .",
    "it behaves as an autocorrelation function of a turbulent velocity rather than uncorrelated velocity fluctuations .",
    "as function of scale in pc . ]",
    "figure 3 presents the turbulence spectral function @xmath23 computed from the autocorrelation function .",
    "the curve is noisy but a power law range is clear . also here",
    "the turbulence spectral functions with @xmath19 and @xmath20 are plotted .",
    "the two slopes are compatible with the computed spectral function , although @xmath20 seems preferable .",
    "the wavenumber range shown corresponds to spatial scales between @xmath24 , which is in this case the length of the line @xmath11 , and @xmath25 .",
    "higher wavenumbers correspond to spatial scales that are smaller than the average radius of the shells , and therefore the computed turbulence spectrum is not valid for these scales .",
    "the results of the present work strengthen the case for the turbulence interpretation of the 21 cm power spectra of the smc .",
    "the residual radial velocities of the super shells exhibit statistical spatial correlations expected from turbulence .",
    "the turbulence spectrum and structure function are consistent with a kolmogorov spectrum , @xmath26 , and with that of incompressible turbulence , @xmath20 .",
