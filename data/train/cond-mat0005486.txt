    "until recently , the spin glass ( sg ) phase of @xmath3 ( lsco ) , with @xmath4 , was believed to have short ranged commensurate correlations , with incommensurate ( ic ) correlations appearing only at the onset of superconductivity @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "new data on lsco have however revealed ic spin correlations also in the sg regime @xcite .",
    "the short range nature of the correlations may point to the existence of a strongly disordered stripe glass , in accord with our previous analysis @xcite which predicted an instability of the stripe array towards a disorder dominated phase . within the picture of disordered stripes ,",
    "one is however immediately confronted with a problem of two fundamentally different scales : the inter - stripe distance , @xmath6 , which scales as @xmath7 @xcite and the average separation , @xmath8 , between disorder centers ( sr ions ) which scales as @xmath9 .",
    "a conflict arises because for pinned stripes , both scales are associated with the charge sector . as @xmath10 in the sg regime",
    ", the stripes must break up into short segments or drastically reduce the on - stripe charge density to take advantage of the disorder potential @xcite .",
    "such a conflict does not arise in models which assume that holes localize individually near their dopants , as indicated by transport measurements @xcite , and act as frustration centers to the af order @xcite .",
    "a polarization of the frustration centers can then lead to the appearance of ic correlations @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the scale @xmath6 exists only in the spin sector whereas @xmath8 is characteristic of the charge distribution . in the following",
    "we revisit this model , assuming that holes produce dipolar frustration , and show that it can well explain the experiments .",
    "our analysis sheds light on the origin of the cluster spin glass phase which in our analysis arises from topological defects of a spiral spin texture .",
    "because dipolar frustration produces a long range distortion of the af order , this problem can be treated within a continuum field theory approach . a non - linear @xmath11-model ( nl@xmath11 m ) for this problem reads @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spin stiffness , @xmath14 the temperature and @xmath15 a three component unit vector representing the local staggered moment ( we set @xmath16 ) .",
    "the quenched field @xmath17 represents the dipoles , with zero mean and a gaussian distribution .",
    "an analysis of ( [ dipham ] ) leads to a finite correlation length at @xmath18 for any finite disorder strength and to fair agreement with the temperature and doping dependence of the correlation length of lsco @xcite .",
    "as it stands , the model however predicts commensurate af correlations , in contradiction with experiments @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the dipole model can lead to ic correlations @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ dipham ] ) favors the formation of a spiral phase , with a non - zero average twist @xmath19 of the af order and a simultaneous alignment of the dipoles , @xmath20 , as long as the lattice and spin degrees of freedom of dipoles are annealed .",
    "while the spiral phase has been found to be unstable in the case of an annealed hole distribution towards a local enhancement of the spiral pitch , this instability arises from the fermionic susceptibility @xcite an hence is absent in the model considered here , where all fermionic degrees of freedom are quenched .",
    "further , as the lattice part of the @xmath17 vector should reflect the symmetries of the underlying lattice , a discrete set of favored lattice vectors for the formation of the spiral exists .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-@xmath1 ( or square lattice ) symmetry breaking associated with the formation of spiral correlations can have truly long range order .",
    "the continuous symmetry of spin space on the other hand inhibits long range magnetic order in the 2d system for either finite temperature or finite disorder .",
    "the experimental observation of a macroscopic @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry @xcite but very short spin correlation lengths thus clearly motivate the study of the dipole model .",
    "we here investigate the dipole model assuming a random spatial distribution of the dipoles but allowing for non - zero ordered moments .",
    "the non - collinearity of the ground state which arises from ordered moments requires a serious modification of previous collinear approaches for two reasons : first , the symmetry breaking scheme of non - collinear magnets leads to the appearance of three rather than two goldstone modes which couple to disorder .",
    "second , a spiral phase allows for pointlike topological defects ( td s ) with @xmath21 charges @xcite , which originate from a chiral degeneracy of the spiral ground state and which are absent in collinear models .",
    "below , we investigate the influence of disorder on both the goldstone modes , using a renormalization group ( rg ) approach , and on the creation of td s , using a free energy argument . a strongly disordered regime ,",
    "as associated with a sg , is only found once topological defects of the spin texture are accounted for .",
    "the situation encountered here thus resembles that of disordered planar xy models , where the coupling of the disorder to spin waves was also found to lead to a simple renormalization of the spin stiffness whereas a phase transition to a disordered phase is driven by a proliferation of td s @xcite .",
    "there are however profound differences between these simpler xy models and the present model .",
    "specifically , the renormalization of the spin stiffness in the later case is primarily driven by the curvature of the order parameter space while in the former case the renormalization arises from the presence of td s .",
    "further , the influence of td s on the renormalization of non - collinear heisenberg models is at present not understood and a unified renormalization group approach which accounts for both td s and curvature terms is not available @xcite .",
    "we therefore derive the rg equations without incorporating td s while we address the importance of td s in a separate analysis below , where we determine the critical disorder threshold of the unbinding transition . below this threshold , but not above , the rg decribes the system correctly .",
    "as in presence of spiral correlations the @xmath22 symmetry of the spins is broken completely , the @xmath2 af model ( [ dipham ] ) is not adequate .",
    "we need a formulation of the problem which incorporates the order parameter for a spiral , which is an element of @xmath23 @xcite . thus , there are three instead of the two goldstone modes of collinear magnets .",
    "a possible representation of the local spiral order is in terms of orthonormal @xmath24 , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 .",
    "a derivation of a continuum field theory for a spiral state from a lattice heisenberg model can be found in @xcite . using @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the spin at the lattice site ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 is the ic ordering wave vector of the spiral , the effective classical hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath33 where we ignore small anisotropies of order @xmath34 in the stiffnesses @xmath35 .",
    "roughly , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the vector @xmath38 is to lowest order given by @xmath39 .",
    "the second term makes this hamiltonian unstable , which simply shows that the pure heisenberg model does not support a spiral ground state .",
    "we show below that this term is cancelled by a term originating from the coupling of the spins to the dipoles .",
    "thus , the ordered dipoles stabilize the spiral phase .",
    "we use a phenomenological form for the coupling of the spiral order parameter to the dipoles .",
    "the dipoles locally ca nt the spin order and couple to the first spatial derivatives of the @xmath24 fields . to generate the frustration produced by the dipoles we thus introduce a minimal coupling @xcite in the first term of ( [ spiral1 ] ) , i.e. we replace @xmath40 with @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath42 is a random dipole field .",
    "the components of @xmath43 are @xmath44 matrix representations of angular momenta which generate rotations about the three spin axes , with @xmath45 .",
    "let us write @xmath46 so that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the disorder average",
    ". we obtain the following hamiltonian for the spiral in presence of disorder , @xmath49 where the ordered part of the dipole field cancels the second term in ( [ spiral1 ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath50 . as @xmath51 , this equation relates the incommensurability linearly to the density of ordered dipoles .",
    "the remaining part of the dipole field , @xmath52 , is a quenched variable with zero mean and we assume gaussian short ranged statistics , @xmath53 . in absence of disorder ,",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath23 symmetric .",
    "the model reduces to ( [ dipham ] ) in the case @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in",
    "fourier space , the disorder coupling takes the form of a correlated random field coupling @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and correlations @xmath60 . using an imry - ma type argument",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this coupling is marginal in two dimensions and that therefore a rg analysis is required to investigate the scaling of the disorder term .",
    "the rg is obtained in the @xmath61 representation @xcite where @xmath62/2 $ ] ( @xmath63 are pauli matrices and @xmath64 ) . introducing @xmath65 /2 $ ] @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ spiral2 ] ) can be written in the form , @xmath66 +   2 \\int d^{2}{\\bf x } \\ p_k \\",

    "\\epsilon_{abc } \\   a_\\mu^i \\",

    "@xmath69 the symmetry is enhanced to @xmath70 while at @xmath71 the model is collinear .",
    "the one - loop rg equations are obtained by splitting the field @xmath72 into slow and fast modes , @xmath73 @xmath74 and tracing out the fast modes @xmath75 with fluctuations in the range @xmath76 $ ] ( where the original uv cutoff is 1 ) . for @xmath77 the rg equations are given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath80 , these equations describe the rg of a clean spiral @xcite , while for the collinear point @xmath71 , the equations reproduce the rg of the stiffness for disordered collinear models @xcite . from ( [ rgt ] )",
    "it is seen that there are two fixed points for @xmath0 , see also fig .",
    "[ rgflow ] .",
    "the collinear point @xmath71 is unstable whereas @xmath69 is stable , irrespective of the disorder .",
    "the coupling to weak disorder thus only renormalizes the spin stiffness but does not not lead to any new fixed points .",
    "the validity of ( [ rgt ] ) is however limited to high temperatures , for low temperatures the rg of @xmath81 must be accounted for .",
    "we have calculated the rg of @xmath81 using the method described in @xcite . however , for @xmath82 new disorder coupling terms appear .",
    "specifically , the rg generates transverse correlated fields which couple to the @xmath83 vectors even at @xmath71 ( i.  e.  @xmath54 ) , whereas in the original hamiltonian with @xmath71 they only couple to @xmath84 , see eq .",
    "( [ rfc ] ) .",
    "such transverse correlated fields _ destroy the collinear fixed point_. thus , even if the original af order is collinear ( i.e. in absence of dipole ordering ) , the disorder drives the system to a non - collinear state . we recover the rg equations for the collinear model obtained in @xcite only if we ignore the correlated transverse field coupling .",
    "a purely collinear analysis is thus not valid in presence of dipoles and can not describe the low temperature regime correctly .",
    "this is in fact expected , because a random canting of the spins destroys the remaining @xmath85 spin symmetry of the collinear model .",
    "we conjecture that the system will always flow to the point @xmath69 , although this remains to be proven .    at the highest symmetry point @xmath69",
    "however , no new coupling terms are generated .",
    "it is then straightforward to arrive at the following rg equations , valid for @xmath69 but any initial ratio of @xmath86 , @xmath87 which can be simplified through @xmath88 to get @xmath89 .",
    "so for @xmath69 the presence of disorder leads to an additive renormalization of the stiffness , @xmath90 . in presence of any amount of disorder ,",
    "the ic correlation length @xmath91 at @xmath18 is finite , as can be inferred from an integration of the rg equation , yielding @xmath92 at @xmath18 with some constant @xmath93 .",
    "while the disorder scales to strong coupling , the relative disorder strength with respect to the stiffness , @xmath86 , always scales to zero so that at long wavelengths the disorder becomes less relevant .",
    "this is surprisingly different to the situation with @xmath71 fixed @xcite , where the ratio @xmath86 was found to diverge below a certain initial value of @xmath94 which was interpreted as the scaling towards a new disorder dominated regime .",
    "thus , if one correctly takes into account non - collinearity , this cross over to a strongly disordered phase disappears .    to summarize , within the perturbative rg analysis disorder leads only to a simple renormalization of the spin stiffness which in turn leads to a finite correlation length already at @xmath18 .",
    "as mentioned already in the introduction , disorder may have a more dramatic effect via the creation of td s in the spin texture .",
    "below , we analyse the stability of the spin system against the creation of such defects .",
    "td s in spirals are related to the chiral degeneracy of the spiral , i.e. a spiral can turn clock- or anti - clock wise @xcite .",
    "these defects are pointlike and at a td the spiral changes its chirality .",
    "saddle point solutions of td s for spirals are of the form @xcite @xmath95,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is a space independent unit vector and @xmath97 satisfies @xmath98 with singular solutions @xmath99 . in fig .",
    "[ topopic ] the spin distribution around an isolated defect in a homogeneous spiral is shown for @xmath100 .",
    "the energy of a td diverges logarithmically with the linear system size @xmath101 , @xmath102 \\pi \\ln r / 2 t$ ] , so for @xmath103 the lowest energy defects have @xmath104 while for @xmath105 , @xmath106 is preferred .",
    "because of the logarithmic divergence of the energy , isolated td s are absent in clean systems at sufficiently low enough temperatures and in this regime the predictions of the nl@xmath11 m analysis should hold . indeed , nl@xmath11 m predictions for related frustrated heisenberg models were found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations at low temperatures @xcite . only at higher temperatures an abrupt decrease of the correlation length",
    "was observed which has been attributed to the appearance of unpaired td s @xcite .",
    "it has been argued , that the high - temperature regime is similar to the equivalent phase of xy models , as both are governed by the plasma phase of the coulomb gas model @xcite .",
    "the spiral defects differ however from their xy counterparts in that the logarithmic divergence of the energy appears only for length scales smaller than the correlation length obtained from the nl@xmath11 m analysis . in an expansion around the saddle",
    "points the defects do not decouple from the spin waves even at the lowest ( gaussian ) level .",
    "also , td s of spirals carry a @xmath21 charge , whereas xy vortices have @xmath107 charges . despite these differences , the critical temperature , at which free td s first appear can in both cases be well estimated using a free energy argument @xcite .",
    "a comparison to xy models is further usefull as the disorder coupling we employed is very similar to the one appearing in xy models with randomly fluctuating gauge fields @xcite . in these models , if one ignores vortices , the influence of the disorder was shown to amount to a simple renormalization of the spin stiffness @xcite , and no disordering transition as a function of the disorder strength is found .",
    "once td s are included in the analysis , randomness leads to a disordered phase even at @xmath18 through the creation of unpaired defects if the disorder fluctuations are stronger than some critical value @xcite .",
    "similar to the estimate of the critical temperature at which thermal fluctuations lead to the appearance of td s , the critical disorder strength is well estimated from the free energy of an isolated defect in presence of disorder @xcite . here",
    ", we use this approach to calculate the critical disorder strength for the spiral state .",
    "the free energy of a defect state is given by @xmath108 , where the second term contains the contribution of disorder , @xmath109 with @xmath110 , @xmath24 derived from ( [ topog ] ) .",
    "using the replica trick one finds at low temperatures @xmath111 for @xmath112 and @xmath113 for @xmath114 .",
    "thus , at low temperatures and @xmath115 free defects are absent and the system is well described within the nl@xmath11 m analysis above . for strong disorder , @xmath116 , the creation of td s is favorable even at @xmath18 , leading to a proliferation of free td s and much shorter correlation lengths than predicted from the nl@xmath11 m , without affecting the incommensurability . anticipating the analogy to xy models , for @xmath116 we expect an ic correlation length roughly given by @xmath117 ( with some constant @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "however , instead of the divergence of @xmath91 at @xmath118 a crossover to the nl@xmath11 m result is expected .",
    "experiments found the incommensurability to scale roughly linearly with doping which points to a doping independent ordered fraction of dipoles . to judge , whether or not td s play a role in the lsco sg phase",
    ", we must estimate @xmath81 .",
    "we can use as a lower bound for @xmath81 the result obtained from the collinear analysis @xcite where a disorder parameter equivalent to ours , but defined on the much smaller scale of the af unit cell , was used . from a fit of the correlation lengths behavior at @xmath119 and large temperatures , it is obtained @xmath120 . in this regime of @xmath121 ,",
    "the low temperature phase has long range af order and a collinear analysis is well justified .",
    "this relation should remain valid also in the sg regime , a view consistent with experiments where the width of the distribution of internal magnetic fields ( i.e. local staggered moments ) was found to increase simply linearly with doping , with no detectable change on crossing the af / sg phase boundary @xcite .",
    "if we use our above estimate for the critical disorder strength we find remarkably a critical @xmath122 .",
    "considering that @xmath120 is a conservative lower bound of @xmath81 at the long length scales relevant to spirals , we conclude that in the entire sg phase , free td s will be present already at @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we expect at @xmath18 ic correlation lengths which roughly follow @xmath123",
    ".    our suggestion , that the ic correlations are related to ordered dipolar frustration centers can be directly tested experimentally in co - doped samples @xmath124 .",
    "it was argued @xcite that co - doping has the effect of renormalizing the density of dipoles to lower values @xmath125 ( experiments indicate @xmath126 @xcite ) as zn atoms placed close to a localized hole strongly distort the hole wavefunction which leads to a reduction or complete destruction of the af frustration induced by the hole .",
    "thus , co - doping with zn has two effects : first , it lowers the amount of frustration in the sample and thus enhances the correlation length @xcite .",
    "secondly , zn doping also lowers the total amount of ordered dipoles which leads to a decrease of the incommensurability by a factor @xmath127 which should be observable experimentally .",
    "we propose a novel description of the sg phase as a strongly disordered spiral state , which can account for the ic correlations and the @xmath0-@xmath1 asymmetry without invoking any kind of charge order .",
    "we show that a collinear analysis is inadequate to describe the strongly disordered regime .",
    "no sharp transition towards a disorder dominated phase is found within the nl@xmath11 m model analysis and td s of the spiral must be accounted for to explain the extremely short correlations observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "the picture of the cluster sg phase as proposed in @xcite has some similarities to our work in that it invokes the presence of defects .",
    "however , in this picture , the defects are those of an @xmath2 spin system ( skyrmions ) . also , while the skyrmion model predicts ic correlations only for @xmath128 @xcite , our analysis includes ic correlations from the outset .",
