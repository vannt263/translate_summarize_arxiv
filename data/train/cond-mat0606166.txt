    "a graphite monolayer has a @xmath0-linear , massless dirac - like spectrum and has long attracted theoretical interests as a `` relativistic '' problem in condensed matter physics , where @xmath0 is the absolute value of the wave vector .",

    "a similar scba analysis has been applied for monolayer graphene.@xcite we shall find that the coexistence of @xmath0-linear and @xmath0-square dispersions leads to a crossover between transport properties similar to those of a monolayer graphene and to those of an ordinary two - dimensional metal as the fermi energy is changed .",
    "the conductivity becomes nearly universal , @xmath1 per spin , in the case of large disorder .",
    "the analysis is made for two different kinds of scatterers , short range and long range , where the former represents on - site random energies distributed on the carbon atoms and the latter a slowly varying random potential of the range much longer than the lattice constant but shorter than the typical electron wavelength .    in sec .",

    "the situation becomes different in the weak - disorder limit @xmath139 , where @xmath193 at zero energy drops from the boltzmann conductivity almost by the factor @xmath102 .",
    "this behavior is essentially equivalent to that in monolayer graphene , where the conductivity drops from the boltzmann to the universal value @xmath194 in the vicinity of the zero energy and the near - singular drop was ascribed to a reduction of the effective density of states contributing to the conductivity.@xcite the universal value was shown to be unaffected by magnetic fields,@xcite and similar near - singular behavior was shown to be present in various transport quantities.@xcite a universal conductivity at zero energy was also reported in the square tight - binding lattice model with one - half flux,@xcite which has @xmath0-linear dispersion as well .",
    "this zero - energy conductivity can be explicitly estimated from ( [ eq_sigma ] ) with the density of states ( [ eq_rho_low ] ) and the square velocity ( [ eq_vsq_low ] ) . the integral turns out to be independent of the imaginary part of the self - energy and returns a universal value @xmath195 which is six times as large as the conductivity in the monolayer .",
    "the extra factor comes from the product of the density of states and the square velocity , @xmath196 , which is larger than in the monolayer by a factor of 6 due to the existence of the satellite elliptic fermi pockets .",
    "recently transport properties of bilayer graphene were studied experimentally.@xcite the resistivity exhibits a prominent peak at @xmath197 and decreases rapidly with the increase of the energy or the electron concentration .",
    "this dependence is explained by eq .",
    "( [ eq_sigma_scba ] ) or ( [ eq_sigma_scba_long ] ) ( or the lower panel of fig.[fig_cond_short ] or [ fig_cond_long ] ) qualitatively quite well with the disorder parameter @xmath198 , in the region @xmath199 @xmath31 . in particular , the observed peak resistivity @xmath200 k@xmath20 corresponds well to the present result for @xmath201 in the case of long - range disorder ( dominant usually ) and @xmath202 in the case of short - range disorder .",
