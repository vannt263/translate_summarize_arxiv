    "over the last decade , electron transport studies in quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) nanostructures have resulted in important discoveries , such as conductance quantization and oscillatory length dependence , molecular rectification , negative differential resistance , hysteresis behavior , etc.@xcite at present , peculiar mechanisms of electron transport are fairly well understood for pristine atomic wires ( aws )  @xcite , carbon nanotubes ( cns ) and some cn - based components  @xcite .",
    "carbon nanotubes  graphene sheets rolled - up into cylinders of one to a few nanometers in diameter and up to hundreds of microns in length  @xcite  have been successfully integrated into miniaturized electronic , electromechanical , chemical devices and into nanocomposite materials  @xcite , and have found a variety of applications in optoelectronics  @xcite .",
    "enormous potential of carbon nanotubes as building blocks for designing optoelectronic nanodevices stems from their extraordinary thermomechanical stability combined with unique physical properties that originate from quasi - one - dimensionality to give rise to a peculiar quasi-1d band structure featuring intrinsic , spatially confined , collective electronic excitations such as excitons and plasmons  @xcite . due to the circumferential quantization of the longitudinal electron motion , real axial ( along the cn axis ) optical conductivities of single wall cns consist of series of peaks @xmath0 , representing the first , second , etc .",
    "excitons , respectively [ see fig .",

    "imaginary conductivities are linked with the real ones by the kramers - kronig relation , and so real _ inverse _ conductivities show the resonances @xmath1 next to their excitonic counterparts .",
    "these are weakly dispersive , low - energy ( @xmath2  ev ) inter - band plasmon modes .",

    "aw systems can not be explained by a mere addition of the properties of pristine cns and aws , suggesting a crucial role of the cn  aw interactions with a variety of associated quantum interference effects , including opening extra ( collective ) transport channels  @xcite .",
    "for example , metallic single wall cns encapsulating eu atomic wires are experimentally demonstrated to have extra conduction channels to supplement an overall `` tomonaga - luttinger liquid''-like transport behavior  @xcite , and with both cns and aws being non - metals their compound cn  aw hybrids are theoretically predicted to be metallic for cns of appropriately chosen diameters  @xcite .",
    "pristine metallic single wall cns are excellent conductors by themselves  @xcite , and so , theoretically , there is no surprise about extra channels in the cn transport that emerge upon encapsulating metal aws into them . from theoretical perspective , more interesting is a hybrid system of metal - atomic - wire encapsulating _ semiconducting _ cns . in these systems , at low bias voltages not exceeding the cn fundamental band - gap , the cn itself does not have any intrinsic open channels to conduct electrons .",

    "however , aws encapsulated into cns will experience near - field em coupling to the cn interband plasmon modes represented by the large dos resonances in panel  ( b ) .",

    "however , one can hardly expect such a strong resonance coupling for identical atoms aligned on a wire inside the cn as the @xmath7 and @xmath8 transition states are here a subset of the one - dimensional electronic band states , and so are not as clearly defined as those for an individual atom , to most likely result in a weaker _ non - resonance _",

    "<S> we develop an electron transport theory for the hybrid system of a semiconducting carbon nanotube that encapsulates a one - atom - thick metallic wire . </S>",
    "<S> the theory predicts fano resonances in electron transport through the system , whereby the interaction of electrons on the wire with nanotube plasmon generated near - fields blocks some of the wire transmission channels to open up the new coherent plasmon - mediated channel in the nanotube forbidden gap outside the wire transmission band . </S>",
    "<S> such a channel makes the entire hybrid system transparent in the energy domain where neither wire , nor nanotube is indivudually transparent . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be used to manipulate by the electron charge transfer in hybrid nanodevices built on metal - semiconductor nanotube systems . </S>"
