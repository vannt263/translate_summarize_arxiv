    "nuclear mass is a basic quantity in nuclear physics , since it plays an important role not only in nuclear physics  @xcite , but also in other branches of science , such as astrophysics and cosmology  @xcite . during the past decades",
    ", great progress has been made in the mass measurements of atomic nuclei .",
    "more than @xmath4 nuclear masses have been determined precisely  @xcite . by analyzing the systematic trends in the mass surface and its derivatives , masses of nuclei near the region of known masses",
    "can be estimated with the audi - wasptra extrapolation method  @xcite .",
    "the local mass relations , such as the garvey - kelson ( gk ) relations  @xcite , the systematics of proton - neutron interactions  @xcite and the coulomb - energy displacement  @xcite , and systematics of @xmath5-decay energies  @xcite can also be applied to predict the masses of nuclei near the known region , although the intrinsic errors grow rapidly when these local mass relations are used for predictions in an iterative way .    to predict masses of nuclei",
    "far from known region , two types of global mass models are nowadays widely used : the macroscopic - microscopic and microscopic mass models . in the macroscopic - microscopic mass model ,",
    "e.g. , the finite - range droplet model ( frdm )  @xcite and the weizscker - skyrme ( ws ) model  @xcite , the microscopic correction energies are extracted from the single - particle levels predicted with phenomenological potential , so numerical computations with this type of mass model is relatively fast .",
    "moreover , various physical effects can be easily taken into account .",
    "for instance , by including the surface diffuseness correction for unstable nuclei , the accuracy of ws model has been significantly improved .",
    "the corresponding root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation with respect to data in the atomic mass evaluation of 2012 ( ame2012 ) falls to @xmath6  kev , crossing the @xmath7  mev accuracy threshold for the first time within the mean - field framework  @xcite .",
    "guiding by the semi - classical periodic orbit theory , a new macroscopic - microscopic mass model is proposed ( for simplicity , this mass model is named as bhagwat model hereafter ) , in which the fluctuating part of nuclear mass is taken as functions of the fermi momentum of neutron and proton ( i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and the proximity to shell closures  @xcite . the bhagwat mass formula yields an rms deviation of @xmath10  kev , which is one of the smallest deviations reported in literatures to our knowledge .",
    "in contrast to the macroscopic - microscopic model , the mass calculation with microscopic models is usually much complicated , but it is usually thought to have a better extrapolation ability .",
    "this kind of models has their own merits , e.g. , it can be used to predict various nuclear properties within a unified framework , including not only the ground - state properties  @xcite but also the excited - state properties  @xcite .",
    "based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method with skyrme or gogny force , a series of microscopic mass models have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "apart from the non - relativistic ones , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model has also been employed for the systematic calculations of nuclear masses recently  @xcite .",
    "although these global mass models have achieved great progress in recent years , the accuracies in their predictions are generally worse than those from the local mass formulas ( @xmath3 kev ) .",
    "meanwhile , the deviations among the mass predictions of different global models are still widely distributed over the nuclear chart .",
    "recently , the clean image reconstruction technique was applied to improve the accuracy of nuclear mass models , and indeed it significantly reduces the rms deviation to the known masses  @xcite .",
    "an alternative simple and effective approach to improve the accuracy of mass models is the radial basis function ( rbf ) .",
    "recent works  @xcite already demonstrated its ability to improve the description of nuclear masses and the two - neutron severation energies .",
    "however , it was also noticed that remarkable odd - even staggering exists between the masses improved by the rbf approach and the experimental data .",
    "the problem accordingly deteriorates the description of nuclear single - neutron separation energies  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we attempt to cure the odd - even deviations found in our previous rbf calculations , which will be presented in sec .  iii . for completeness , a brief introduction to the rbf approach will be given in sec .",
    "ii , and a summary will be presented in sec .",
    "the rbf approach was first introduced to improve the mass predictions of nuclear models in ref .",
    "more details can be found in ref .  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the solution at point @xmath11 is represented as a sum of @xmath12 radial basis functions @xmath13 weighted by an appropriate coefficient @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the euclidean norm between point @xmath11 and center @xmath17 .",
    "the weight @xmath14 is determined by training the rbf with @xmath12 samples @xmath18 , which means the reconstructed function @xmath19 at point @xmath17 is just the value @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23",

    "+    to better investigate this odd - even staggering , first of all , it would be instructive to organize the data into 4 groups , characterized by the odd - even parity of ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , i.e. , the ( even @xmath0 , even @xmath1 ) , ( even @xmath0 , odd @xmath1 ) , ( odd @xmath0 , even @xmath1 ) , and ( odd @xmath0 , odd @xmath1 ) . the mass differences between the experimental data and the predictions of the rmf+rbf model for the even-@xmath0-even-@xmath1 ( e - e ) nuclei , even-@xmath0-odd-@xmath1 ( e - o ) nuclei , odd-@xmath0-even-@xmath1 ( o - e ) nuclei , and odd-@xmath0-odd-@xmath1 ( o - o ) nuclei are shown in panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) of fig .",

    "specifically , the masses are systematically overestimated for the e - e nuclei , while they are systematically underestimated for the o - e and o - o nuclei . for the e - o nuclei ,",
    "the masses are underestimated in the light mass region with @xmath43 , while they are overestimated in the heavy mass region with @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the odd - even effect , originating from the quantum effect of the last few valence nucleons , is not able to be fully washed out when training the whole nuclear database simultaneously in a single rbf approach .    , but for the rmf+rbfoe model.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]",
    "+    since the rbf approach can well eliminate the local systematic deviations , these systematic deviations for the e - e , e - o , o - e , and o - o nuclei should be removed with the rbf approach if we train the rbf separately for these four groups . for simplicity",
    ", such an rbf approach considering the odd - even effects is called to be the rbfoe approach , and the mass models improved by the rbfoe approach is denoted by model+rbfoe hereafter . in panels ( a ) ,",

    "it should be noted that @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are shown in the logarithm scale .",
    "very large components are found at low frequencies for the rmf model , which corresponds to the local and slow change of the mass differences of rmf model  @xcite . with the rbf approach ,",
    "this local mass differences are well eliminated , as reflected by the fact that the large @xmath66 values at low frequencies are significantly reduced .",
    "however , a slightly enhanced components are observed at high frequencies . from the preceding discussions , we already know that these high - frequency components mainly originate from the odd - even staggering of mass differences .",
    "these high - frequency components can be further reduced to a large extend with the rbfoe approach .",
    "no dominant large - frequency components are observed for the rbfoe approach , or in other words , it is difficult to find particular correlations of the mass differences over the nuclear chart . this again verifies the success of the rbfoe in reproducing the whole nuclear mass surface .",
    "similar distributions of the fourier amplitudes are also observed for other mass models .",
    "in fact , as mentioned above , the best accuracy is obtained for the ws+rbfoe approach , which is already very close to the chaos - related unpredictability limit for the calculation of nuclear masses  @xcite .",
    "in this work , the rbf approach is extended to include the odd - even effects by separately training the rbf for the four groups of nuclei with different odd - even parities of ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , i.e. , the e - e , e - o , o - e , and o - o nuclei .",
    "taking nine widely used nuclear mass models as examples , we found that the rbfoe approach can significantly improve the nuclear mass predictions .",
    "the rms deviations of all these models with respect to the known mass in ame2012 are reduced to less than @xmath67  kev . in particular , @xmath2  kev is obtained for the ws4+rbfoe approach , which is very close to the chaos - related unpredictability limit ( @xmath3 kev ) . moreover ,",
    "the description of single - nucleon separation energies , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , is better reproduced by the rbfoe approach .",
    "we also attempt to analyze the differences of mass predictions to the known data with their fourier amplitudes , from which the regularity of mass differences for the original mass models and model+rbf approaches is clearly found .",
    "however , no dominant frequency components are observed for the rbfoe approach , which again verifies the success of the rbfoe in reproducing the whole nuclear mass surface .    for further improving nuclear mass predictions , it is important to map the fourier amplitude from the frequency region to the nuclear region . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fk ] ) , it is clear that the fourier amplitude at a certain frequency corresponds to a sum on all nuclear mass differences weighted by exponential functions , so a certain frequency can not easily map to a specific nuclear region .",
