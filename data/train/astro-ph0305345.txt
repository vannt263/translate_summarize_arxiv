    "explanations of this type have involved firstly , an intermediate mass black hole binary .",
    "makishima et al . ( 2000 ) required black hole masses of between @xmath103 and @xmath1080 m@xmath9 for the eddington limit not to be exceeded .",
    "in general , intermediate mass black hole models involve masses of @xmath30 - @xmath31 m@xmath9 , i.e. more massive than galactic bhb such as cygx-1 , and substantially less massive than agn .",
    "this possibility has been invoked to explain the most luminous , variable ulx in m82 ( kaaret et al . 2001 )",
    ". however , king et al . ( 2001 ) discussed the difficulties of forming these , and proposed an alternative model involving mild beaming and a link with galactic micro - quasars .",
    "it has been known that ulx occur preferentially in regions of star formation ( zezas et al .",
    "1999 ; roberts & warwick 2000 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the model is consistent with the expected association of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) with young stellar populations .",
    "the numbers of ulx found in the antennae galaxies ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2001 ) supports the connection with recent massive star formation .",
    "ulx were also detected in elliptical galaxies which do not contain hmxb , e.g. sarazin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which led king ( 2002 ) to extend the model by proposing two types of ulx : persistent sources predominating in galaxies with young stellar populations , and micro - quasars with bright , prolonged outbursts occurring in elliptical galaxies .    however , there is also the possibility that ulx do not consist of a single or even two types of object .",
    "objects generating x - ray luminosities larger than the eddington limit for a neutron star include not only stellar mass black holes ( m @xmath32 100 m@xmath9 ) but very young supernova remnants ( roberts & warwick , 2000 ; king et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "some pre-_chandra _ ulx may have been unresolved `` super - bubbles '' of shock - heated hii in the ism ( e.g. stewart & walter 2000 ) , typically with diameters @xmath102001000  pc . with the 0.3 arcsec ( on - axis )",
    "resolution of _ chandra _ ( van speybroeck et al . 1997 ; van speybroeck 1999 ) these objects would appear extended in nearby galaxies , for example , 0.3 arcsec corresponds to a size of 27 - 40 pc at the distance of the antennae galaxies ( 20 - 30 mpc ) ( fabbiano et al .",
    "young , compact supernova remnants , which can reach luminosities of a few @xmath33 erg  s@xmath3 ( immler & lewin 2002 ) would not be resolved even with _",
    "chandra _ , except in the nearest members of the local group .",
    "similarly an unresolved cluster of sub - eddington low mass or high mass xrb may appear ultra - luminous .",
    "this could be in a globular cluster such as the two sources in the galactic globular cluster m15 , white & angelini 2001 ) . since the diameter of a globular cluster is typically 10 pc , these objects also can not be resolved , even with _",
    "large amplitude variability would be a strong pointer that the source consists of a single object or a group of a small number of objects only ( roberts & warwick , 2000 ) .    in this paper , we examine systematically _ chandra _ acis observations of 13 normal galaxies to detect all super - eddington sources and so determine whether the prevalence of ulx depends upon galaxy morphology .",
    "one aim of the work was to examine the spectra of the brighter sources and search for any spectral property that may reveal the nature of a ulx source .",
    "thirteen galaxies were selected from the available _ chandra _ observations in the public archive in the summer of 2001 , that were classified by the _",
    "chandra _ x - ray centre ( _ cxc _ ) as normal galaxies .",
    "these galaxies were selected on the basis that the observations were longer than @xmath1010 ksec , and covered a range of types . while this is not a statistically complete sample , the seven spiral ,",
    "four elliptical and two irregular galaxies allow us to investigate whether there is any correlation of ulx occurrence with morphology .",

    "the spurious source detection probability was set at @xmath53 per pixel , corresponding to 0.014 spurious detections per square arcmin .",
    "exposure maps created with mkexpmap at 1.7  kev were used with wavdetect to minimize spurious detections at the detector chip boundaries and these aspects were checked by manual inspection of the images . in two galaxies , ic5332 and ngc1569 , no sources were detected exceeding @xmath54 erg  s@xmath3 .",

    "radial profiles ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) confirmed possible extended sources as those significantly broader than the psf . for a typical off - axis psf of 1 arcsec width ,",
    "a typical distance of 10 mpc implies a size of 50 pc , so that to appear point - like in _ chandra _ a source must have a size no larger than this .",
    "only 10 sources eventually proved to have an extended component .",
    "we selected the point sources lying within the @xmath34-band 25th magnitude isophotes derived from rc3 , which are thus likely to be associated with the galaxy .",
    "for these , spectra , lightcurves and instrument response functions were generated .",
    "background data were extracted from annuli centred upon the source region and lying entirely within the same ccd node .",
    "the annuli were chosen to cover an area at least 8 times larger than the source extraction region and containing at least 20 photons ( although such regions frequently exceeded this limit ) . to prevent contamination of the background spectra by photons from bright point sources ,",
    "all photons detected within a region six times larger than the 1-@xmath38 encircled - energy ellipse of every source , and centred on that source were removed prior to background accumulation .",
    "such a large masking region was adopted since with a 3-@xmath38 region , a few per cent of a source s intensity will remain .    the total count from a given detection varied between @xmath10100 and 1000 ( table 4 ) .",
    "thus to plot light curves in the normal way to achieve poisson errors of 10% , say , would allow a very small number of bins , and searching for variability by @xmath55 testing would not be sensible in most cases . we thus applied a kolmogorov - smirnov test to the arrival times of photons and the numbers of photons that arrive by a particular time are compared with those expected for constant intensity .",
    "this test strictly requires unbinned data , and so we used the primitive binning of the acis data of 3.24 s , although binning does not bias the test provided there are many primitive bins .",
    "this revealed only one source in galaxy ngc253 which displayed variability at the 99% significance level , this source having a luminosity of @xmath56 erg s@xmath3 , located at @xmath57 = 00@xmath58 47@xmath59 30.@xmath609 , @xmath61 = -25@xmath62 18@xmath63 26(2000 ) .",
    "other sources exhibited no evidence for variability , however the kolmogorov - smirnov test does not provide upper limits for non - detections .",
    "we carried out simple @xmath55 testing which indicated that other sources were not variable at a confidence of at least 90% .",
    "we adopt the procedure ( below ) of considering only sources brighter than @xmath54 erg s@xmath3 , so that no bright sources detected ( shown in tables 3  5 ) displayed significant variability . thus , none of the sources in the sample examined provided evidence in this way that the object was not a superposition of sources .",
    "radial brightness profiles were derived for each point source detected , which allowed extended sources to be clearly identified by comparing the profiles with the psf derived for each position ( see sect .",

    "( 2001 ) to relate the total flux in the 0.37.0 kev band to the fluxes in the sub - bands .",

    "however , the full energy range could not be used in many cases because of insufficient counts . although dependent on the slope of the spectrum , to have usable data above 5 kev , more than 500 counts are needed .",
    "non - standard spectral models were written for use within xspec in which the intensity or normalization of the model equals the unabsorbed energy flux in the 0.37.0 kev band thus allowing flux errors to be obtained directly as the error of a single parameter .",

    "two - component models similarly did not provide evidence for black hole nature .    the correlation between ulx and super - eddington source numbers and 60 @xmath7 m flux supports previous results that such sources occur preferentially in star forming regions ( zezas et al .",

    "( 2003 ) using previous studies of high mass x - ray binaries in the milky way and magellanic clouds , and _",

    "they proposed that the number or collective x - ray luminosity of hmxb could thus be used as a measure of star formation rate .",
    "as an example , we will compare with the galaxy in our sample having the highest 60 @xmath7 m surface brightness , the starburst galaxy ngc253 ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "we can adopt a value of @xmath586 , where @xmath587 is the dynamical mass of the galaxy of @xmath588 yr@xmath3 from grimm et al .",
    "for galaxies of similar type ( sc ) .",
    "taking @xmath587 as @xmath589 m@xmath9 ( calculated from the maximum rotation velocity from _ leda _ ) , this gives a value of @xmath590 @xmath10 2.4 m@xmath9 yr@xmath3 which combined with the linear relation ( fig .",

    "7 plus the 60 @xmath7 m flux of the antennae galaxies , we estimate a value of @xmath85 of 39 , and a value of @xmath591 of 21.7 agreeing reasonably with the 29 super - eddington and 17 ulx actually detected ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "two x - ray sources have luminosities exceeding 10@xmath592 erg  s@xmath3 : ngc1132 psx-1 and ngc1291 psx-1 .",
    "these luminosities imply a mass of at least 100 m@xmath9 if emitting isotropically , assuming they are eddington limited , and it is important to consider these cases carefully .",
    "the former source has 21 counts , so its luminosity is poorly determined , and the error - bars are sufficiently large that the source luminosity may be as small as @xmath593 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this is still a very luminous object .",
    "it is situated away from the nucleus of its parent galaxy , and we expect 0.2 background sources of similar apparent brightness ( sect .",
    "3 ) , so we can not exclude the possibility that it is not associated with the galaxy .",
    "ngc1291 psx-1 has a high count of 390 , and a lower limit luminosity of @xmath594 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "it is a point source embedded in extended emission at the centre of its galaxy , and may be similar to low luminosity agn - like cores in many nearby galaxies ( ho et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "ngc1399 is the massive central galaxy in the fornax cluster having an extensive globular cluster system ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "individual globular clusters will not generally be resolved and so multiple sources within them may be confused .",
    "indeed angelini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) note a higher average count rate of apparently point - like sources in globular clusters in ngc1399 , which they suggest may be explained in this manner",
    ". this may be the reason why there are so many ulx in this galaxy .",
    "bright globular cluster x - ray sources are usually lmxb .",
    "although there is some evidence for globular cluster sources being somewhat less bright on average than lmxb in the rest of the galaxy , verbunt ( 2002 ) concludes that this may be unreal .",
    "thus if we use an average luminosity of non - cluster sources of @xmath595 erg s@xmath3 ( verbunt et al .",
    "1984 ) , we find that the addition of 50 of these would needed to explain any ulx in this galaxy .",
    "the super - eddington sources and the ulx in our sample are point - like , within the spatial resolution of _ chandra _ , implying sizes typically @xmath32 50 pc .",
    "these limits would seem to preclude super - bubbles or super - giant shells being possible sites for the emission .",
    "although young snr may be compact , we would expect these to be found preferentially in regions of continuing star formation in late - type galaxies .",
    "snr spectra may either appear as optically - thin emission with lines , or alternatively be featureless .",
    "our spectral fitting shows mekal models as preferred in only one or two cases , suggesting a snr nature ; we may however detect other snr with featureless spectra which are not revealed in this way .",
    "zezas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show by optical identification that a relatively small fraction of ulx in their sample are snr , implying that our dependence on infrared flux must be mostly due to other types of object .",
    "this survey of 13 galaxies revealed 22 ulx sources with @xmath596(0.3 - 7.0  kev)@xmath597 erg  s@xmath3 , and a further 39 sources with @xmath598 erg  s@xmath599 ( but less than @xmath600 erg  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "accidental coalignment of background sources is not a major effect as 62% of these ulx must truly lie within their apparent host galaxies .",
    "several sources were found that were clearly extended beyond the instrumental psf and are shown in table 5 .",
    "two sources appeared on the colour - colour diagram in a position suggesting possible black hole nature .",
    "we present spectral fitting results for 14 of the 22 ulx having a count @xmath1 200 , the total count varying between 200 and 3200 in the spectra fitted .",
    "several of the sources could be fitted by an absorbed power law model suggesting non - thermal emission such as comptonization .",
    "seven of the sources were well - fitted by a blackbody plus power law model , also suggesting x - ray binary nature , although it was not possible to distinguish the type of xrb .",
    "two sources were well - fitted by a one - component blackbody model suggesting high state black hole nature .",
    "however , we do not have positive evidence that any more than a relatively small fraction of the ulx are black hole binaries .",
