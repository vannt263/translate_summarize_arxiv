    "soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) are low - mass x - ray binaries consisting of a neutron star or black - hole primary , which undergo unstable accretion from a late - type companion",

    "during such an outburst , the optical flux becomes dominated by the contribution of the accretion disk and is enhanced by several magnitudes . in the intervals between outbursts , which typically last years to decades , the x - ray luminosity is extremely low , and the optical flux is dominated by the luminosity of the secondary star ( see verbunt  1994 , van paradijs & mcclintock 1995 and narayan , mcclintock & yi 1996 for reviews of the quiescence x - ray and optical properties of sxts ) . therefore , the properties of the secondary star can be studied during the quiescent episode .",
    "the sxt  ( 16 ) , discovered on 1994 july 27 with batse ( 20100 kev ) on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( @xcite ) , has been studied extensively during the past two years in x - rays and at optical and radio wavelengths ( tingay  1995 , bailyn  1995a , harmon  1995b , hjellming & rupen 1995 , zhang  1995 , bailyn  1995b , paciesas  1996 , van der hooft  1997 ) .",

    "is remarkable , due to the fast recurrence of its successive x - ray outbursts since the first x - ray detection of the source in 1994 .",
    "the x - ray outbursts of  were initially separated by intervals of about 120 days ( @xcite ) and lasted many weeks ( harmon  1995a , b ; wilson 1995 ) . during these periods",
    "the optical brightness of  was between 1 and 2 magnitudes above its quiescent _",
    "v_=17.3 pre - outburst level ( @xcite ) , which likely reflects the contribution of the accretion disk and x - ray heating of the secondary star .",
    "most photometric observations of  were made during this period .",
    "however , in the interval 1995 september to 1996 april , no significant x - ray flux was detected from indicating a ( temporary ) longer period of quiescence .",
    "we present in this paper the results of extensive _ v _ , _ r _ , and _",
    "i _ band photometry of  obtained during 1996 march , and derive its quiescence light- and color curves .",
    "we derive limits on the system parameters based on @xmath8 theoretical light- and color curves in the three photometric bands , calculated for a wide range of parameters of a model describing a roche lobe filling secondary star supplemented with a model of an accretion disk around the compact star .",
    "the limits on the mass of the secondary star are compared with theoretical evolutionary tracks which we computed for both single and binary star evolution .",
    "we observed  ( 16 ) during 28 consecutive nights starting 1996 march 5 with the 0.91 m dutch telescope at the european southern observatory ( eso ) in chile .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a ccd camera and the observations were made using standard _",
    "v _ and _ r _ filters and a gunn _ i _ filter .",
    "integration times were 10 minutes for the _ v _ filter and 5 minutes for the _ r _ and _ i _ filters .",

    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we applied aperture photometry to  and five nearby comparison stars using midas and additionally written software operating in the midas environment .",
    "the five comparison stars were checked for variability over the entire data set . from the disperion of the relative magnitudes of each comparison star over the entire observing period ( @xmath10 mag )",
    "we conclude that the brightness of these stars is constant .",
    "the accuracy of a single measurement of the differential magnitude of  ( relative to the average of the five comparison stars ) , taking into account poisson noise only , is typically 0.006 mag in each of the three bands .",
    "photometric calibration of the data was performed using images of two landolt standard fields ( @xcite ) , rubin 149 ( 8 stars ) and pg  1323 ( 4 stars ) , during nights of good photometric quality .",
    "observations of different standard fields within one night showed that the accuracy of the photometric calibration was better then 0.05 mag .",
    "during the period of our observations the average _ v _ magnitude of   was 17.25 and the light curve showed a modulation with two equal maxima and unequal minima , whose depths are 0.31 and 0.48 magnitudes .",
    "the average _ v _ magnitude of  is consistent with the pre - outburst brightness of _ v_=17.3 ( @xcite ) , which indicates that the source was in quiescence during the period of our observations . during two successive pointings on march 8 , separated by @xmath11 hours",
    ", we detected a very low optical brightness of  in each of the three filters ( for the _",
    "v_-band we then found _ v_=17.48 and _ v_=17.53 , respectively ) .",
    "there is remarkably little variability superposed on the quiescence light curve of  in comparison to several other quiescent sxts , which show cycle - to - cycle variations of the order of a few percent ( mcclintock & remillard 1986 , remillard  1992 , martin  1995 , chevalier & ilovaisky 1996 , shahbaz  1996 ) .",
    "haswell ( 1996 ) has recently suggested that such brightness variations may be similar to those seen in superhumps during superoutbursts of su uma type cataclysmic variables .",
    "the data in the three bands were independently searched for periodicities using a lomb - scargle periodogram ( @xcite ) .",
    "the periodograms show five strong peaks , corresponding to half the orbital period and its one - day aliases , and associated with each peak the characteristic pattern resulting from the data sampling . in each band",
    "we found a distinct maximum at a fundamental period of 1.3123 days .",
    "since the light curve of  features two minima with unequal depth , we folded the data on twice this period , using a trial zero point ( chosen in the center of the data set ) .",
    "the time of inferior conjunction of the secondary , @xmath12 , was derived from the folded light curve , by fitting a parabola to the shallow minimum , which yielded a phase offset to be applied to the trial zero point .",
    "the shallow minimum occurs close to the epoch of inferior conjunction of the secondary star as predicted by the ephemerides of  reported in previous investigations ( see e.g. bailyn  1995b , van der hooft  1997 ) .",
    "the photometric period of 2.6246 days of  is slightly longer than previous measurements of the period based on both photometric and spectroscopic observations ( see e.g. bailyn  1995b , van der hooft  1997 ) . in order to improve the accuracy of the orbital period we combined 9 photometric measurements of @xmath12 from our 1995 and 1996 data with photometric measurements by bailyn  ( 1995b ) and orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) , and two spectroscopic measurements by casares ( 1996 ) and orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) . from a least - squares fit of this set of 13 arrival times to their respective cycle numbers ( spanning 140 cycles ) we derived the following refined ephemeris for the times of inferior conjunction of the secondary star : hjd @xmath0 , with @xmath13=2.3 for 11 degrees of freedom . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we present the _ v _ , _ r _ and _ i _ light curves of  folded at this ephemeris .",
    "the drawn lines represent light curves which were computed using a theoretical model of the secondary star which will be described in detail in sect .  3.2 .",

    "_ r _ and _ i _ measurements taken close in time ( @xmath14 min ) .",
    "these color indices , folded at the above ephemeris , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , together with theoretical color curves ( see sect .",
    "they show a clear modulation with the photometric period .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitudes in the _ ( v ",
    "r ) _ and _ ( r  i ) _ color curves are @xmath15 and @xmath16 mag , respectively .",
    "the color curves have two unequal maxima and two equal minima .",
    "the maxima of the color curves occur near phase 0.0 and 0.5 ( the largest occurs near phase 0.5 ) , indicating that is reddest near conjunctions ; the system is bluest near quadratures ( phases 0.25 and 0.75 ) .      to construct theoretical light curves we calculated the flux of the secondary emitted into the direction of the observer as a function of orbital phase , by numerical integration of the contributions from a large number of small elements on the secondary s surface .",
    "we used a numerical model , discussed in detail by tjemkes  ( 1986 ) , based on a description of the tidal and rotational distortion of the secondary in terms of an equipotential surface .",
    "the non - uniform surface brightness distribution across the secondary is described according to von zeipel s theorem .",
    "we adopted 0.25 as the value of the gravity darkening coefficient @xmath17 , valid for stars with a radiative envelope ( @xcite ) .",
    "for each surface element we used a black - body approximation ( at the local effective temperature ) for the perpendicularly emerging specific intensity .",
    "we applied a standard linear limb darkening law , with limb darkening coefficients as a function of temperature taken from al - naimy ( 1978 ) .",
    "for the theoretical spectra calculated by kurucz ( 1979 ) one finds that over the effective temperature interval 5500 to 8000 k ( covering virtually all surface elements on the secondary ) the average deviation of the gradient @xmath18 with respect to the blackbody approximation is @xmath19  % ( similar results were obtained for the dependence of @xmath20 and @xmath21 on @xmath22 [ @xmath23 ) . to estimate the effect of our blackbody approximation on our results we have made trial calculations in which the planck functions were multiplied by an arbitrary function of @xmath22 which accounts for the difference with the kurucz spectra .",
    "we find that the depth of the deepest minimum changes by @xmath24  % ( _ v_-band ) and @xmath25  % ( _ r _ and _ i_-band ) with respect to the blackbody approximation , while the depth of the shallow minimum changes by @xmath26  % ( _ v_-band ) and @xmath24  % ( _ r _ and _ i_-band ) .",
    "these differences are small enough that their effect on the solutions in the @xmath27 plane ( see below ) can be ignored compared to the effects of uncertainty in the system parameters .",
    "initially , the possible contribution of an accretion disk to the emergent flux was not included in our modelling , nor were mutual eclipses and the effect of x - ray heating on the secondary . in our calculations",
    "we used the secondary mass @xmath28 and the orbital inclination @xmath29 as free parameters . the observed mass function",
    "@xmath30  m@xmath3 ( @xcite ) then fixes the primary mass @xmath31 and the mass ratio @xmath32 .",
    "together with the bolometric luminosity @xmath33 of the secondary , the temperature distribution across the latter s surface , and the light curve , are determined .",
    "we calculated a first set of 81 light curves ( and their corresponding color curves ) for @xmath29 between @xmath34 ( steps of @xmath35 ) , and secondary masses in the range @xmath36 m@xmath3 ( steps of 0.5  m@xmath3 ) .",

    "each of the theoretical light curves were given an offset such that the data observed at the shallow minimum ( phase 0.0 ) was matched .",
    "we found that none of these light curves could reproduce the sharp and deep minimum at phase 0.5 , indicating that our model requires additional structure . near this phase",
    "the compact object is in front of the secondary star , and the light curve shows significant scatter whereas it is smooth during the remaining part of the orbital cycle . both the sharpness of the minimum and the increased scatter near phase 0.5 likely result from the presence of an accretion disk around the compact star , which is obscuring ( part of ) the light of the secondary at this phase .",
    "there is no evidence for a disturbance of the light curve near phase 0.0 ; we therefore , in this first phase of our analysis , computed a @xmath40 for each set of parameters , using the light curves in the three photometric bands simultaneously from which the data obtained between photometric phase 0.35 and 0.65 were excluded .",
    "we found that the only acceptable solutions are for @xmath29 in the range @xmath41 , for any of the secondary masses between 0.54.5 m@xmath42 .",
    "we made a new set of theoretical light ( and color ) curves , using a denser grid of @xmath29 and @xmath28 values : @xmath43 ( @xmath44 step size ) and @xmath45 m@xmath42 ( 0.1 m@xmath42 step size ) , respectively .    from the fits of the theoretical to the observed light curves we find that the binary inclination and mass of the secondary star can be well constrained .",
    "the @xmath40 contours in the @xmath29 versus @xmath28 plane trace a narrow , ellipse - shaped region .",
    "such a correlation between @xmath29 and @xmath28 is expected as the amplitude of the brightness modulation will decrease with both smaller inclination angles and larger mass of the secondary star ( the distortion of the secondary , and therefore the temperature contrast across the stellar surface decreases as @xmath28 increases ) .",
    "a minimal @xmath40 of 2.54 ( 130 d.o.f . ) was found at ( @xmath46 , 1.60 m@xmath42 ) , which indicates that minor variations are present in the light curve in the phase interval 0.651.35 .",
    "the 1 , 2 and @xmath47 confidence contours in the @xmath27 plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , which were computed by scaling the required @xmath48 by the minimum value of @xmath49 .",
    "the assumed value of the bolometric luminosity of the secondary star of   ( 41 l@xmath3 ) is sensitive to errors in both the distance to the source and its color excess .",
    "the latter is probably the most important source of uncertainty as the distance is well determined at @xmath50 kpc ( @xcite ) based on a kinematic model of the radio jets ; other distance estimates are consistent with this value [ 3.5 kpc ( @xcite ) ; 35 kpc ( @xcite ) both based on h i absorption ; @xmath51 kpc ( @xcite ) based on interstellar absorption ; @xmath51 kpc ( @xcite ) based on a dust scattering halo ] .",
    "a minimal value of the color excess was reported by bailyn  ( 1995a ) [ _ e(b  v)_=1.15 based on the equivalent width of the na d - lines in optical spectra taken in 1994 august ] , while a largest _ e(b ",

    "the 1 , 2 and @xmath47 confidence contours were computed similar as in the case of 41 l@xmath42 , and are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .      the model described in sect .",
    "3.2 quite well describes the data obtained at inferior conjunction of the secondary star , but not those obtained near superior conjunction , when we observe less light than the model predicts .",
    "a natural explanation for the flux deficit near phase 0.5 is that an accretion disk around the compact star obscures part of the secondary at certain viewing angles . in the second stage of our modelling efforts",
    "we included an accretion disk in the model , described as a flat cylinder with a radial temperature distribution .",
    "the vertical outer edge of the disk is assumed not to emit radiation . by including such an accretion disk the number of parameters in the model",
    "is increased by three : the radius of the disk as a fraction of the effective roche lobe , @xmath62 , the flaring angle @xmath63 of the disk , and the temperature at the outer edge of the disk , @xmath64 . in view of the very low x - ray luminosity of  during the period of our observations",
    ", we assumed that the radial temperature distribution in the disk follows an @xmath65 dependence ( pringle 1981 ) .",
    "we computed @xmath66 theoretical light and color curves for intrinsic luminosities of 31 , 41 and 54 l@xmath42 , a fractional disk radius between 0.6 and 1.0 ( step size of 0.1 ) , outer disk temperatures of 100 or 1000 k , and a flaring angle of the disk of either @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "we used step sizes of @xmath44 and 0.1 m@xmath42 for @xmath29 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "we performed several tests ( using a less dense grid for @xmath29 , and @xmath28 ) in which temperatures at the outer edge of the disk were selected between 100 and 6000 k. light curves computed with @xmath69 k do not resemble the data well : for such outer edge temperatures the accretion disk contributes too much to the total flux of the system , which decreases the amplitude of the ellipsoidal modulation and changes the relative depth of the minima in the light curve . at superior conjunction of the secondary star ,",
    "the contribution of the disk to the total flux is @xmath70 for _ t_@xmath71 k , and is entirely negligible for lower values of _ t_@xmath72 .",
    "thus , the main effect of the disk is to occult a fraction of the secondary star near phase 0.5 .    in calculating @xmath40",
    "we did not include the six deviating points ( two in each of the three passbands ) obtained during subsequent pointings on march 8 ; they must be caused by variations in the disk structure , which can not be incorporated into our model .",
    "for each set of parameters , the 1 , 2 and @xmath47 confidence contours in the @xmath27 diagram were computed as before .",
    "the confidence contours corresponding to models having an accretion disk with a flaring angle @xmath73 , and an outer - edge temperature @xmath74 k , are shown in fig .",
    "the top - left panel of this figure displays the confidence contours for @xmath56  l@xmath42 and fractional disk radii between 0.6 and 1.0 .",
    "these contours trace narrow ( @xmath75 wide ) ellipses in the @xmath27 plane . since the light curve of  is dominated by ellipsoidal variations ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) , the ` islands ' derived for the different fractional disk radii are located in the same general area of the @xmath27 diagram as the contours which were derived from the pure ellipsoidal model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "as expected , for increasing values of @xmath62 the confidence contours move toward smaller values of @xmath29 .    in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the confidence contours for intrinsic luminosities of 31 ( dashed ) , 41 ( solid ) and 54 l@xmath42 ( dashed - dotted ) are displayed , with the other parameters unchanged . from this panel",
    "it follows that for a given fractional disk size , and intrinsic luminosities between 31 and 54 l@xmath42 the solutions move along a rather narrow track in the @xmath27 diagram .",
    "solutions for larger secondary masses are found at smaller inclination angles , since an accretion disk of a given relative size can obscure the light of the secondary star at smaller values of @xmath29 as @xmath28 , and therefore , the size of the secondary , increases . in the remainder of our analysis we have assumed that the fractional disk radius is in the range 0.7 to 0.9 ( see e.g. paczyski 1977 , and frank  1992 ) .    we can further constrain the system parameters by noting that the spectral type of the secondary limits the range of its effective temperature ( averaged over the secondary surface ) , and therefore of the secondary radius . since the secondary is assumed to fill its roche lobe ( this fixes its average density ) , for a given value of @xmath33 this requirement limits the position of the system in the @xmath27 diagram . the effective temperature decreases with both smaller intrinsic luminosity and larger mass of the secondary star ( for a roche lobe filling secondary the average density depends only on orbital period ) .",
    "the secondary of  has been classified as an f3-f6 type star ( @xcite ) . according to popper ( 1980 ) , effective temperatures of such stars are in the range 63306620 k.",

    "average effective temperatures of @xmath77 k are obtained for secondary masses of 3.6 m@xmath42 and higher .",
    "this limiting mass is much larger than the maximum mass of the secondary allowed by the disk models for this luminosity .",
    "therefore , taking the mass limit imposed by the average effective temperature of the secondary star into account , we can exclude an intrinsic luminosity of 54 l@xmath42 for  ( see top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . for the other two intrinsic luminosities , the average effective",
    "temperature limits the secondary mass to the range 1.62.1 m@xmath42 ( 31 l@xmath42 ) and 2.43.1 m@xmath42 ( 41 l@xmath42 ) , well inside the collection of solutions for these disk models .",
    "the combined constraints for these two values of @xmath33 have been indicated by hatched polygons in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    given the smooth variation of the location of the confidence contours in the ( @xmath78 ) plane in response to changes in the fractional disk radius or bolometric luminosity , we connected both hatched areas by smooth curves , thereby producing a final constraint on the system in the @xmath27 plane , which is shown in the lower - right panel of fig .",

    "[ fig5 ] is derived for the case @xmath79 k and @xmath73 only .    in fig .",

    "the average _ v _ magnitude of  during our march 1996 observations was 17.25 , consistent with the pre - outburst brightness of _",
    "v_=17.3 ( @xcite ) , which indicates that the source was then in quiescence .",
    "this is confirmed by x - ray observations of  made with asca and rosat during march 1996 , which showed that its x - ray luminosity then was @xmath85 erg / s ( robinson 1997 ) .",
    "no significant x - ray flux of  was detected with rxte during the period of our observations ( 3@xmath86 upper limit of 12 mcrab in the 212 kev band ) ; x - rays were first detected from  with rxte on april 23 , 1996 ( remillard  1996 ) .    also , the smoothness of the _ v _ , _ r _ and _ i _ light curves ( spanning 11 consecutive cycles of ) is in contrast to earlier reports of significant cycle - to - cycle variations in the  light curve during periods of known x - ray activity ( @xcite ) . the relative depth of the two minima in the light curves of  is consistent with a quiescence optical light curve caused by ellipsoidal variations , the deepest minimum occuring at superior conjunction of the secondary star as expected .",
    "the brightening in x - rays in late april 1996 was followed by increased activity at optical , and radio wavelengths ( horne  1996 , hunstead & campbell - wilson 1996 , hjellming & rupen 1996 ) .",
    "we determined a revised ephemeris for inferior conjunction of the secondary star with respect to the black hole by combining our measurements of @xmath87 with those published in other investigations , spanning a total of 140 orbits of .",
    "this period differs by @xmath88 from the period we derived previously ( @xcite ) , and @xmath89 from the spectroscopic period derived by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) .",

    "r ) _ , @xmath16 in _ ( r  i ) _ and @xmath90 in _ ( v  i)_. the system is reddest near the conjunctions , bluest at the quadratures .",
    "this colour variation reflects the varying temperature across the surface of the secondary ; its pronounced appearance is the result of the wavelength and temperature dependence of the limb darkening , which gives relatively low weight to emission from near the apparent horizon of the secondary .",
    "the light curve of  can be understood in terms of a model of a distorted secondary star in combination with an accretion disk .",
    "the disk eclipses part of the secondary near phase 0.5 , but does not give a significant contribution to the total luminosity of the system .",
    "the largest variability in the light curve of  occurs close to phase 0.5 , and is most likely caused by variability in the structure of the outer disk , causing variability in the fraction of the secondary that is being eclipsed .",
    "our modelling of the light curves has led to constraints on the system parameters , which have been summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , in the form of allowed regions in the @xmath27 diagram .",
    "these regions incorporate solutions over the full range in bolometric luminosity of the secondary . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] it appears that there is some dependence of the solutions on the assumed value of the flaring angle @xmath63 of the disk , but that it is virtually independent of its temperature structure .",
    "the reason is that the light curve away from phase 0.5 does not allow the disk to contribute substantially to the optical emission of the system , which sets an upper limit to its outer temperature of @xmath91  k ; for these temperatures the main effect of the disk is to eclipse the secondary . since for a given value of @xmath29 the fraction of the secondary that is eclipsed increases with @xmath63 , we find an anti - correlation between @xmath63 and @xmath29 for the allowed solutions ( compare the top and bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .    since the mass function of the system is relatively well determined , a region in the @xmath27 plane allowed by the light curves corresponds to a range of allowed values of the mass ratio and the mass of the compact object in .",
    "for @xmath73 we find inclination angles in the range @xmath92 and secondary masses between 1.6 and 3.1 m@xmath3 .",
    "this then implies a mass ratio , @xmath93 , and mass of the compact object , @xmath31 , in the ranges 2.433.99 and 6.297.60 m@xmath42 , respectively . for @xmath81",
    "the allowed ranges of @xmath29 and @xmath28 are @xmath94 , and 1.62.45  m@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding allowed ranges of @xmath93 and @xmath31 are 2.934.20 and 6.357.18 m@xmath42 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we present the region in the @xmath28 versus @xmath31 plane occupied by the collection of allowed solutions , for a flaring angle of the accretion disk of @xmath67 ( solid lines ) and @xmath68 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "since the bolometric luminosity and effective temperature of the secondary are well constrained , it is possible to compare the position of the secondary star of  in the herzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) with theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "we have calculated tracks for both single stars and stars in a binary system with a recent version of the evolution code developed by eggleton ( 1971 , 1995 ) . the equation of state and the opacity tables",
    "have recently been discussed by pols  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the mass loss in the binary calculations was assumed to be conservative and in all calculations we used a metallicity of @xmath95 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we present a hrd with theoretical evolutionary tracks of single stars with masses 2.0 , 2.25 , 2.5 , 3.0 , and 4.0 m@xmath3 ( solid lines ) . based on this figure",
    ", we position the secondary of  on the track for a single star with a mass of @xmath96 m@xmath3 . assuming a mass of 7 m@xmath3 for the black hole primary , we obtain an orbital period of about 2.6 days ( by adopting a radius for the roche lobe filling secondary from the evolution track at the center of the error box",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ] , applying kepler s third law and the relation between orbital separation and effective roche radius of a star ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the observed period of 2.62 days .",
    "however , this is not the only evolutionary track that fits the observations .",
    "since the secondary is losing mass , it must have been evolved from an initially more massive star .",
    "therefore , we computed several evolution tracks of the secondary star in a black - hole binary system , for which we adopted in all cases a total system mass of 9.2 m@xmath3 .",
    "the effect of a different value for the total system mass ( 811 m@xmath3 ) does not change the outcome of our results significantly .",
    "it follows from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] that a secondary with an initial mass as large as 4.0 m@xmath3 can also evolve towards the current hrd position of the secondary of .",
    "when the tracks of these stars intersect the error box bounded by @xmath97 and @xmath98 , the orbital period and mass are about equal to the case of an evolved single star .",
    "this is not surprising as the secondary is less massive than the accreting star , fills its roche lobe and starts losing mass on the main - sequence .",
    "the mass loss then occurs on a nuclear time scale , as is the case for a secondary with an initial mass of 4 m@xmath3 . for the secondaries with lower initial masses ,",
    "the mass loss starts further on the main - sequence or even at the moment when the secondary is already crossing the hertzsprung - gap .",
    "since the radius is expanding at a much higher rate , the time scale for mass loss is now smaller than the nuclear time scale , but still a factor of 10 larger than the thermal time scale . for an initial mass of the secondary @xmath99 m@xmath3 , the present mass and orbital period for all tracks of the mass - losing star that cross the center of the error box shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] are between 2.02.3 m@xmath3 and 2.63.1 days , respectively .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the binary nature of  is not very important for the determination of the present mass of the secondary based on evolutionary tracks .    from standard evolutionary calculations for single stars , we find that the tracks of stars with a mass in the range 2.12.4 m@xmath3 are consistent with the current position of the secondary of  in the hrd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "this method to determine the mass of the secondary star is entirely independent of the constraints derived in sect .",
    "3.3 from modelling the light curves of .",
    "we emphasize that the mass range derived from evolutionary arguments is consistent with that obtained from modelling the light curves .",
    "our results are consistent with those obtained by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) .",
    "these authors describe the quiescence light curve of  ( obtained during the same period as our data ) in terms of an ellipsoidal model and an accretion disk . the main differences between their analysis and the one discussed here are the value of the power - law exponent of the radial temperature distribution on the accretion disk ( fixed to 0.75 in this work , free parameter in the analysis by orosz & bailyn 1997 ) , and the use of the temperature at the pole of the secondary star as input parameter ( fixed to 6500 k , orosz & bailyn 1997 ) , in contrast to a range of intrinsic luminosities ( 31 , 41 , and 54 l@xmath42 , this work ) as input to our model .",
    "the best fitting @xmath100 values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 statistical errors ) found by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) , combined with the mass function imply a secondary and black hole mass of @xmath104 and @xmath105 m@xmath42 , consistent with our results .",
    "also , the values for the fractional disk size ( @xmath106 ) , and angular thickness of the disk ( @xmath107 ) derived by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) are consistent with the results discussed here for the case of a thin ( @xmath67 ) accretion disk . however",
    ", our analysis shows that models with an accretion disk of @xmath68 angular thickness are also able to describe the data well .",
    "the contribution of the accretion disk to the total luminosity is governed by its fractional size and mean temperature , and therefore , by the temperature at the outer edge of the disk and the radial temperature distribution on the disk .",
    "orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) derived an outer edge temperature of @xmath108 k , significantly larger than the value we derived from our analysis .",
    "this probably reflects the different value of the power law exponent between both analyses ; in our analysis the exponent was kept fixed to 0.75 ( pringle 1981 ) , while orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) treated the exponent as a free parameter and obtained a value of @xmath109 .",
    "however , it should be noted that in both analyses the contribution of the disk to the total luminosity of the system is less than @xmath110 , consistent with the value derived from spectroscopy during 1996 february ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "the errors quoted by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) are @xmath103 internal statistical errors , derived from fitting the light curves of .",
    "note however , that in our analysis we have included errors caused by systematic uncertainties in the properties of the system , e.g. in the interstellar absorption its light suffers .",
    "therefore , we allow for a range of intrinsic luminosities of  ( 3154 l@xmath42 ) .",
    "we also allow a range of values for the parameters describing the size and temperature of the accretion disk ( @xmath111 , and @xmath112 k ) , and adopt the @xmath47 confidence contours ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the limits to the system parameters we have derived in this study are somewhat larger compared to those obtained by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) .      in our modelling of the light curve of  we have made a number of implicit assumptions , e.g. , with respect to the geometry of the disk , and such assumptions may affect the results of our analysis systematically .",
    "there is one assumption whose systematic effect is particularly strong , i.e. , that the non - uniform temperature distribution across the surface of the secondary can be described by a standard gravity darkening coefficient @xmath113 .",
    "this value applies in a situation where the outer layers of a star are in radiative equilibrium . for stars with convective outer layers lucy ( 1967 )",
    "derived a gravity darkening coefficient of 0.08 . at its spectral type ( f3-f6 )",
    "the secondary of  is near the boundary in the hertzsprung - russell diagram separating hot stars with radiative envelopes and cool stars with convective envelopes .",
    "therefore , it may contain a shallow convective layer .",
    "we have investigated the applicability of standard gravity darkening by computing light curves for @xmath17 in the range 0.08 to 0.25 ( in steps of 0.01 ) .",
    "decreasing @xmath17 leads to a decrease in the brightness contrast over the secondary s surface , and therefore to a decrease of the amplitude of the light curve .",
    "since the amplitude increases with @xmath29 the strongest limits on @xmath17 are obtained for @xmath114 . for an assumed @xmath115  m@xmath3 and @xmath56  l@xmath3 ( near the center of our solution space )",
    "we derive a lower limit @xmath116 on the gravity darkening coefficient .",
    "this suggests that the assumption @xmath113 is justified .",
    "we conclude that during our march 1996 observations  was in a state of true x - ray quiescence .",
    "we derive a refined ephemeris for inferior conjunction of the secondary star with respect to the compact star of hjd @xmath0 .",
    "we calculated theoretical light- and color curves , which constrain the binary inclination and mass of the secondary star to lie in the range @xmath117 and 1.603.10 m@xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the implied mass of the black - hole is in the range 6.297.60 m@xmath42 .",
    "we find that an accretion disk is required to model the light- and color curve of .",
    "the disk does not contribute significantly to the luminosity , and therefore , acts as body of obscuration only .",
    "the mass range we obtained for the secondary star is supported by the results of stellar evolution calculations .",
