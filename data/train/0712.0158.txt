    "in recent years , heusler alloys have become the subject of intensive experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "the strong interest to these systems is mainly due to two unique properties : half - metallic behavior and martensitic phase transformations .",
    "@xcite the half - metallicity was first predicted by de groot and collaborators in 1983 when studying the band structure of a half - heusler alloy nimnsb.@xcite then the half - metallic ferromagnets have become one of the most studied classes of materials.@xcite the existence of a gap in the minority - spin band structure leads to the 100% spin polarization of the electron states at the fermi level and makes these systems attractive for applications in the emerging field of spintronics .",
    "besides strong spin polarization of the charge carriers , the half - metallic materials should have a crystal structure compatible with the industrially used zincblende semiconductors and possess a high curie temperature to allow the applications in the devices operating at room temperature .",
    "the available experimental information shows that heusler alloys are promising materials also in this respect .",
    "@xcite    at low temperatures several heusler compounds ( i.e. , ni@xmath1mnga , co@xmath1nbsn ) undergo a structural transformation from a highly symmetric cubic austenitic phase to a low symmetry martensitic phase .",
    "the compounds that are magnetic in the martensitic phase can exhibit two unusual effects : magnetic shape memory ( msm ) effect and inverse magneto - caloric effect.@xcite in msm alloys an external magnetic field can induce large strains when applied in the martensitic state .",
    "the msm alloys are of great interest as promising smart materials for future technological applications.@xcite they can be used as sensors and actuators in different fields of applications . the inverse magnetocaloric effect ( imce )",
    "has its origin in martensitic phase transformation that modifies the exchange interactions due to the change in the lattice characteristics .",
    "the inverse mce effect was reported for samples with compositions close to ni@xmath1mnz ( @xmath2 , sn).@xcite in the martensitic phase , an adiabatic application of a magnetic field , rather than removal of the field as in ordinary mce , causes the sample to cool .",
    "this feature is regarded promising for the development of economical and ecological refrigerants working near room temperature as an alternative to conventional vapor - cycle refrigeration .",
    "besides being promising materials for various applications the heusler alloys constitute a class of systems that is important also for fundamental researches .",
    "a wide diversity of magnetic properties makes heusler alloys critical test systems for the theoretical models of exchange interactions . indeed , within the same family of alloys one finds very different magnetic behavior : itinerant and localized magnetism , ferrimagnetism , antiferromagnetism , helimagnetism and other types of non - collinear ordering.@xcite    despite a key role of the magnetism in the properties of heusler alloys experimental and theoretical studies of the exchange interactions in heusler alloys are still rare .",
    "the first important information on the exchange coupling in these systems was provided by the inelastic neutron scattering experiments of noda and ishikawa , and tajima _ et .",
    "al . _ , in the late seventies @xcite .",
    "the authors measured the spin wave spectra of ni@xmath1mnsn , pd@xmath1mnsn and cu@xmath1mnal for various directions in the brillouin zone and analyzed the results of the measurements within the heisenberg model .",
    "they obtained a long - ranged and oscillatory behavior of the exchange interactions .",
    "the oscillations were reaching beyond the eight nearest neighbors in all three compounds .",
    "this behavior of the exchange interactions was considered as an evidence for an indirect exchange coupling , mediated via conduction electrons .",
    "the results were interpreted using either an rkky model or _",
    "s - d _ mixing model of anderson ( double resonance model).@xcite the double resonance model was found to be more relevant for heusler alloys due to strong mixing of the mn 3__d _ _ states with the conduction electron states of non magnetic 3__d _ _ and _ sp _ atoms .",
    "this initial attempt of the theoretical analysis did not succeed in the description of the sign and the magnitude of exchange interactions between nearest and next nearest neighbors in contrast to good agreement for larger distances.@xcite the failure of the theories to describe near - neighbor exchange interactions was attributed to the asymptotic approximations .",
    "price has shown that anderson _ s - d _ mixing model free of asymptotic approximations was able to capture qualitative features of the observed spin wave spectra of pd@xmath1mnsn .",
    "@xcite malmstrm and geldart discussed the effect of the finite spin distribution around mn atoms on the rkky interactions .",
    "@xcite the authors showed that , in spite of simplified treatment of electron band structure , finite spin distribution could bring the calculated values of the exchange interactions in agreement with the exchange interactions determined for the ni@xmath1mnsn and pd@xmath1mnsn compounds from the experiments .",
    "an important feature of the model - hamiltonian approaches is the possibility of separate study of different exchange mechanisms .",
    "however , the use of adjustable parameters and strong simplification of the band - structure strongly restrict the possibility of reliable predictions for concrete materials .",
    "the development of the parameter - free density functional theory ( dft ) has played a crucial role in the understanding of the physical properties of itinerant - electron ferromagnets .",
    "the first contribution to the density functional theory of the exchange interactions and curie temperature in heusler alloys was made in an early paper by kbler and collaborators where the microscopic mechanisms of the magnetism of these systems were discussed on the basis of the comparison of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic configurations of the mn moments.@xcite by analyzing the mn 3__d _ _ density of states for different magnetic configurations the authors proposed the mechanism of an indirect exchange coupling between mn moments .",
    "recently , the studies of the interatomic exchange interactions and curie temperatures in heusler compounds were reported by the present authors and kurtulus _ et al . _",
    "our previous studies on experimentally well established ni - based compounds ni@xmath1mnz ( @xmath3 , in , sn , sb ) revealed a complex character of the magnetism in these systems.@xcite in particular , the obtained long range and oscillatory behavior of the exchange interactions as well as their strong dependence on the _ sp _ atom ( z ) gave an evidence for the conduction - electron mediated exchange interactions in heusler alloys .",
    "the importance of the _ sp_-electrons in the formation of the magnetic properties has been demonstrated by first - principles calculations also for a number of other systems.@xcite the experimental studies as well pointed out to the important role of the _ sp_-electrons .",
    "the early measurements by webster _",
    "_ have shown this for quaternary heusler alloys pd@xmath1mnin@xmath4sn@xmath5 and pd@xmath1mnsn@xmath4sb@xmath5.@xcite recent experimental studies on the mn - based semi heusler compounds ni@xmath4cu@xmath5mnsb and aumnsn@xmath4sb@xmath5 revealed similarities in the behaviour of the two systems with the variation of the number of valence electrons.@xcite in particular , the curie temperatures of both systems decrease by the same amount with increasing concentration @xmath6 and both systems have similar @xmath7 values for compositions with equal numbers of valance electrons .",
    "these studies have shown that both the non - magnetic 3__d__-atoms ( x ) and the _ sp_-atoms ( z ) play important role in establishing magnetic properties .",
    "the explanation of the observed trends in magnetic characteristics of semi - heusler alloys requires consideration of competing exchange mechanisms contributing to the formation of the magnetic state .",
    "one of the important aims of this work is to show that the results of the parameter - free dft calculations for many systems can be qualitatively interpreted in terms of the competition of two exchange mechanisms .",
    "in contrast to our previous studies , here we go beyond the stoichiometric compositions and treat several mn - based semi and full heusler alloys within virtual crystal approximation in order to understand the dependence of physical characteristics on the valance electron number .",
    "the qualitative interpretation of the calculational results is based on the analysis of the anderson s _ s - d _ mixing model.@xcite since the atomic mn moments are well defined the application of the model is well founded . for the last four decades",
    "the anderson model has been successfully applied to variety of problems of condensed matter physics and contributed to better understanding of numerous experimental properties .",
    "the systems studied within the anderson model vary from dilute 3__d _ _ magnetic impurities in non - magnetic metals@xcite to complex systems like heusler alloys@xcite , rare earths@xcite , magnetic multilayers@xcite and diluted magnetic semiconductors.@xcite    in the present paper we show that the diversity of magnetic behavior in mn - based heusler alloys can be interpreted in terms of the competition between ferromagnetic rkky - type exchange and antiferromagnetic superexchange .",
    "a special attention is devoted to the role of the _ sp _ and non - magnetic 3__d _ _",
    "atoms in mediating exchange interactions between mn atoms .",
    "the spin polarization of the conduction electrons appears to be one of the key parameters in the formation of magnetic characteristics .",
    "we obtain strong correlation between spin polarization of the _ sp _ electrons and the strength of the exchange interactions and , as a result , the value of the curie temperature . it is shown that the position of unoccupied peaks of the mn 3__d _ _ density of states plays an important role in the determining the value of the antiferromagnetic superexchange coupling while the properties of the conduction - electron states at the fermi level are mainly responsible for the ferromagnetic rkky - type exchange interaction .",
    "we compare the influence of non - magnetic 3__d _ _ versus 4__d _ _ atoms on the exchange coupling by considering the stoichiometric ni@xmath1mnz and pd@xmath1mnz ( z@xmath8 in , sn , sb , te ) .",
    "one of the main conclusions of the present treatment is that numerous features of the magnetism of the mn - based semi and full heusler alloys with different chemical composition can be described with few parameters .",
    "therefore , the tuning of these parameters can be considered as a tool in the fabrication of the materials with desired magnetic properties .",
    "a part of the present work has been published elsewhere.@xcite the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "iii we present the details of the calculational approach .",
    "section iv contains the discussion of the density of states and magnetic moments . in section",
    "v we dwell on the exchange coupling mechanisms and section vi gives the conclusions .     and @xmath9 structures adapted by the half- and full - heusler alloys .",

    "one of the four sublattices is vacant . in vca",
    ", the z site is occupied by a pseudoatom with a fractional number of valence electrons . ]",
    "semi- and full - heusler alloys crystallize in the @xmath10 and @xmath9 structures respectively ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the lattice consists from 4 interpenetrating fcc lattices . in the case of the semi - heusler alloys ( xyz )",
    "one of the four sublattices is vacant .",
    "the bravais lattice is in both cases fcc .",
    "the calculations are carried out with the augmented spherical wave method ( asw)@xcite within the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa).@xcite the exchange - correlation potential is chosen in the generalized gradient approximation .",
    "@xcite a dense brillouin zone ( bz ) sampling @xmath11 is used .",
    "the radii of all atomic spheres are chosen equal . in the case of semi - heusler alloys we introduce an empty sphere located at the unoccupied site .",
    "we focuss on the systems where the total magnetic moment is confined to mn sublattice that simplifies the interpretation of the obtained results . to this end",
    "we consider pd and cu containing mn - based semi and full heusler alloys that can be written in a compact form as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , ( sn , sb ) , ( sb , te ) and s - h ( f - h ) stands for semi - heusler ( full - heusler ) alloys . to account for non - integer electron numbers we use the virtual crystal approximation ( vca).@xcite in vca , the z site occupied by in and sn atoms according to their concentration which is described by an atom with fractional number of electrons @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of electrons of sn and similarly for other chemical elements . in this approximation only the spin magnetic moment and",
    "the density of states ( dos ) of the pseudoatom can be calculated .",
    "the properties of the pseudoatom can not be projected on the constituting atoms .",
    "an advantage of vca is the possibility of a continuous variation of the electron number without resorting to large super cells .",
    ".experimental and theoretical lattice parameters in x@xmath17mnz ( @xmath18 , cu ; @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , sn , sb , te ) . for explanations",
    "see text . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    in majority of the heusler alloys with chemical formula x@xmath1yz and xyz the y site is occupied by the mn atom , while for the x site there is much more freedom : here can be any element from 3__d _ _ , 4__d _ _ , or 5__d _ _ late transition metals ( i.e. fe , ru , co , rh , ni , pd , pt , cu , ag and au ) .",
    "the magnetic moment of the x atom can for many alloys be neglected .",
    "the exceptions are some of the 3__d _ _ atoms , e.g. , fe or co. since the delocalization of the _ d _ states increases with transition from 3__d _ _ elements to 4__d _ _ and further to 5__d _ _ elements one can expect a substantial dependence of the magnetic properties of the heusler alloys for the occupation of the x site with atoms from different _ d _ series .",
    "the purpose of this section is to study this dependence by means of comparison of two systems : ni@xmath1mnz and pd@xmath1mnz ( @xmath20 , sn , sb , te ) .",
    "we choose two different lattice parameters for each system : 6.07@xmath21 and 6.38@xmath21 .",
    "the first corresponds to the lattice constant of ni - based alloys while the second is the characteristic for the pd - based systems .",
    "the both systems are experimentally well studied . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we present spin projected total dos and _ sp_-electron dos of the x and z atoms for the lattice constant of 6.38@xmath21 .",
    "note that ni ( 3__d _ _ ) is isoelectronic to pd ( 4__d _ _ ) .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments are given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained for the same lattice constant reveals similarity of some features : the value of the mn magnetic moment , _",
    "sp_-electron spin polarization and dos of the _ sp _ states of x and z atoms around the fermi level ( see fig .  [ fig8 ] and table  [ table2 ] ) . on the other hand , well below the fermi energy the dos of the ni - based and pd - based systems differ strongly .",
    "the peaks of the dos of the ni - based compounds are higher and narrower than in the pd - based systems .",
    "this is mainly the result of a more delocalized character of the pd 4__d _ _ orbitals compared to the ni 3__d _ _ orbitals .",
    "as we will show , despite the strong difference of the occupied part of the dos the magnetic properties of two systems are rather close that gives additional support to the conclusion that the states lying close to the fermi level play the most important role in the formation of magnetic properties .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( left panel ) we present the parameters of the mn - mn exchange interactions for ni@xmath1mnz and pd@xmath1mnz ( @xmath22 , sn , sb , te ) for two different values of the lattice constant .",
    "the curie temperatures estimated within mean - field approximation are given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "for both systems the patterns of exchange parameters for the equal lattice constants are rather similar .",
    "the parameters are very close to each other for @xmath23 and sb . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the difference is stronger . this difference is more pronounced for near neighbors .",
    "for example the difference in the first two exchange parameters makes pd@xmath1mnte antiferromagnetic in contrast to the ferromagnetic ni@xmath1mnte .",
    "the analysis in terms of the competition between two types of exchange interactions suggested in the previous section is helpful also in this case .",
    "the long range behavior of the exchange parameters , specifically the rkky - type oscillations can be related to _",
    "sp_-electron spin polarization and total _",
    "sp_-electron dos at the fermi level . as seen from table  [ table2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] these quantities are very close to each other in both systems that explains the similarity in the long range behavior of the exchange interactions .",
    "however , the short range behavior depends very much on the contribution of the antiferromagnetic superexchange . to reveal the importance of this mechanism we present in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] the total dos ( spin - up plus spin - down ) above the fermi energy for both systems and for the lattice constant of 6.38@xmath21 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the dos above the fermi level is not identical for @xmath25 and @xmath18",
    ". therefore the deviations in exchange parameters at least within few coordination spheres can be expected . a very strong similarity in the patterns of the exchange parameters for sn and sb alloys compared to the in and te systems",
    "can not be explained on the basis of the differences in the dos and might be accidental resulting from the cancellation of the contributions of different states to the superexchange .",
    "mnz and pd@xmath1mnz ( z@xmath8 in , sn , sb , te ) above fermi level . ]    next , we comment on the volume dependence of the magnetic properties .",
    "as seen in table  [ table2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , the compression of the volume ( the reduction of the lattice parameter ) leads to the decrease of the mn magnetic moments and an increase of the absolute value of the leading exchange parameters .",
    "the reduction of the magnetic moments is an expected result which is a consequence of the increased interatomic hybridization and broadening of the electron bands .",
    "the volume dependence of the exchange interactions is less straightforward . in general",
    "this dependence is non - monotonous and in concrete physical situations one can find both an increase and a decrease of the exchange interactions with volume contraction .",
    "a detailed discussion of these aspects can be found in ref .",
    "where the electronic structure , exchange interactions and curie temperature of the full - heusler alloy ni@xmath1mnsn are studied as a function of pressure .",
    "it was shown that in low pressure region the t@xmath26 behavior is in qualitative correlation with empirical interaction curve of kanomata _ et .",
    "al . _ which describes the dependence of the curie temperature of the mn - based heusler alloys on the mn - mn distance.@xcite in agreement with experiment we have found that at ambient pressure t@xmath26 increases with increasing pressure that is @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite the pressure dependence has a maximum at 3.6  . indeed , as seen in table  [ table2 ] in agreement with experiments we obtain the same behavior in the t@xmath26 ( t@xmath28 for pd@xmath1mnte ) for all compounds except pd@xmath1mnsb in which the curie temperature decreases with reduction of mn - mn distance .",
    "to summarize , the magnetism of the heusler alloys containing different _ d _ ( 3__d _ _ or 4__d _ _ ) electrons appeared to be qualitatively similar whereas quantitative differences result from the stronger delocalization of the 4__d _ _ electrons and larger lattice parameters of the compounds having 4__d _ _ elements .",
    "we performed a systematic first - principles study to reveal the exchange mechanisms in various mn - based semi- and full - heusler alloys .",
    "the calculation of the exchange parameters is based on the frozen - magnon approach and the curie temperature is estimated within the mean - field approximation . due to large separation of the mn atoms and the local moment nature of magnetism in these systems the exchange coupling is indirect and is mediated by the conduction electrons .",
    "the results obtained are interpreted using _",
    "s - d _ mixing model of anderson . to understand the dependence of physical characteristics on the valence electron number we go beyond the stoichiometric compositions employing virtual crystal approximation .",
    "the influence of non - magnetic 3__d _ _ versus 4__d _ _ electrons on exchange coupling is discussed .",
    "we show that magnetism in these systems strongly depends on the number of conduction electrons , their spin polarization and the position of the unoccupied mn 3__d _ _ states with respect to fermi level .",
    "various magnetic phases are obtained depending on the combination of these characteristics .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram is determined at @xmath29 .",
    "we find that in the case of a large conduction electron spin polarization and the unoccupied mn 3__d _ _ states lying far above the fermi level , an rkky - type ferromagnetic interaction is dominating . on the other hand ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic superexchange becomes important in the presence of large peaks of the unoccupied mn 3__d _ _ states lying close to the fermi energy .",
    "the resulting magnetic behavior depends on the competition of these two exchange mechanisms .",
    "the obtained results are in good correlation with the conclusions made on the basis of the anderson _ s - d _ model and with available experimental data .",
    "these findings suggest that a targeted influence on the corresponding physical quantities can provide a useful tool for the fabrication of materials with desired physical properties .",

    "<S> because of large spatial separation of the mn atoms in heusler alloys ( @xmath0  ) the mn 3__d _ _ states belonging to different atoms do not overlap considerably . </S>",
    "<S> therefore an indirect exchange interaction between mn atoms should play a crucial role in the ferromagnetism of the systems . to study the nature of the ferromagnetism of various mn - based semi- and full - heusler alloys </S>",
    "<S> we perform a systematic first - principles calculation of the exchange interactions in these materials . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the exchange parameters is based on the frozen - magnon approach . </S>",
    "<S> the curie temperature is estimated within the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show that the magnetism of the mn - based heusler alloys depends strongly on the number of conduction _ sp _ electrons , their spin polarization and the position of the unoccupied mn 3__d _ _ states with respect to the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> various magnetic phases are obtained depending on the combination of these characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic phase diagram is determined at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the anderson s _ s - d _ model is used to perform a qualitative analysis of the obtained results . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions leading to diverse magnetic behavior are identified . </S>",
    "<S> if the spin polarization of the conduction electrons at the fermi energy is large and the unoccupied mn 3__d _ _ states lie well above the fermi level , an rkky - type ferromagnetic interaction is dominating . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the antiferromagnetic superexchange becomes important if unoccupied mn 3__d _ _ states lie close to the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting magnetic behavior depends on the competition of these two exchange mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the calculational results are in good correlation with the conclusions made on the basis of the anderson _ s - d _ model which provides useful framework for the analysis of the results of first - principles calculations and helps to formulate the conditions for high curie temperature . </S>"
