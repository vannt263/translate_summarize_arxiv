    "the quest experiment was developed to combine wide - angle atmospheric cherenkov light measurements with the charged particle eas - top measurements ( gran sasso , italy , 2000 m a.s.l.)@xcite .",
    "the wide - angle cherenkov light detector was based upon five quasar-370 ( @xmath1  cm diameter ) hemispheric photomultiplier tubes installed on five telescopes ( average pointing at direction @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) .    the size @xmath4 and core position for every shower has been extracted from eas - top data . the reconstructed cherenkov light lateral distribution function ( cldf )",
    "has been obtained from the cherenkov light flux measured by each detector at the known distance from the axis . a new fitting function , suggested by us in ref .",
    "@xcite , has been used to derive two main parameters of the eas cldf for every recorded event : the light flux at core distance of @xmath5  m @xmath6 and the ldf steepness , defined as the ratio of the fluxes at @xmath7 and @xmath8  m from the axis : @xmath9 .",
    "the energy measurement methods are based on analysis of artificial showers data , simulated with corsika code@xcite .",
    "the total sample of 400 events was simulated for primary energy @xmath10 and @xmath11  pev , and zenith angles @xmath12 from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , 180 of them for primary protons and 180 for iron nuclei using qgsjet@xcite model of hadron interaction and 20 for protons and 20 for iron using sibyll@xcite model . to derive in the analysis of simulation the eas size @xmath4comparable to the experimental one , we have taken into account both electrons and muons and used the experimental procedure of size reconstruction with nkg fitting function .",
    "we obtained from these simulated data the dependences :    \\1 ) of the mean depth of eas maximum @xmath15 on energy @xmath16 , shape and standard deviation of @xmath15 distribution separately for @xmath17 and @xmath18 primaries ,    \\2 ) of @xmath19 on the linear distance to eas maximum @xmath20 and standard deviation of the @xmath19 distribution for fixed @xmath20,separately for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,    \\3 ) of the size @xmath4 on @xmath19 and @xmath16 and the standard deviation of the @xmath4 distribution fo fixed @xmath19 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,    \\4 ) of @xmath6 on @xmath16 and the standard deviation of the @xmath6 distribution at a fixed @xmath16 separately for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    using all these parametrizations and generating as base independent parameters : the primary energy @xmath16 distributed as a power law spectrum , the depth of eas maximum @xmath21 distributed as an asymmetric @xmath22-distribution , the shower axis direction and core position we generate and analyse hundreds thousands of artificial events .",
    "experimental errors in core position and @xmath4 are inserted in this procedure in accordance with @xcite .",
    "the real array geometry and fluctuations of every cherenkov light detector response are taken into account .",
    "we call the described procedure `` model of experiment '' .",
    "it is used for analysis of experimental errors , efficiency and distributions of measured parameters for different assumptions on primary composition . to analyze the experimental data we use different parametrisations of corsika simulation for complex initial composition .",
    "figure  1 shows the connection of ldf steepness @xmath19 with liner distance to eas maximum @xmath20 in [ km ] .",
    "the best parametrisation of this dependence is : @xmath23 , with standard deviation of @xmath20 distribution for fixed @xmath19 : @xmath24 , - which may characterize the theoretical accuracy of the method .",
    "figure  2 shows the corsika simulated correlation between the cldf steepness @xmath19 and the ratio of the size to primary energy ( @xmath25 ) for the 400 above discribed events .",
    "one can notice from fig . 1 and 2 that such relation is almost independent on parameters : primary energy , zenith angle , sort of particle and hadron interaction model .",
    "the correlation between @xmath25 and @xmath19 is more strict than the one between @xmath25 and position of eas maximum .",
    "the difference between @xmath25 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 primaries is less than 6% and for the two interaction models less than 2% ( for @xmath19=4 ) . using the correlation shown in fig.2 we can get the primary energy in experiment from the measurement of @xmath4 and @xmath19 : @xmath26 = 1.59\\times10^{11}\\;n_e / exp(0.76p ) \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] the main practical advantage of this method relies in the well developed technique of scintillator response calibration based on the measurement of the single particle response@xcite .",
    "however the `` model of experiment '' , described above , gives an error of individual measurement of about @xmath27% ( @xmath28 ) mostly due to the experimental error of parameter @xmath19 .",
    "similar method of energy reconstruction , but for ldf steepness , estimated at smaller distances from the core ( @xmath29  m ) , was suggested in ref .",
    "figure . 3 shows the corsika simulated correlation between the primary energy and the parameter @xmath6 . taking into account the distribution of the 400 points shown in fig .",
    "3 we derive out an almost proportional relation between @xmath16 and @xmath6 : @xmath30 .",
    "the main problem of this `` classical '' method , used in many works , is in the absolute calibration coefficient @xmath31 , if one includes the systematic uncertainty of @xmath6 in it .",
    "the error of absolute calibration has been estimated from @xmath32% to @xmath33% for different experiments . to get better accuracy we suggest to use the mean experimental ratio @xmath34 , as the coefficient for the absolute calibration of cherenkov array response .",
    "so finally : @xmath35    `` model of experiment '' displays an experimental uncertainty about @xmath36% for the energy measurement by such expression 2 , i.e. the accuracy of every individual energy measurement is much better than for the size / cldf method .",
    "the final comparison of experimental energy obtained with two methods is shown in fig .",
    "the standard deviation of the experimental distribution is very close to that obtained with the `` model of experiment '' for the size / cldf method , that confirms indirectly the experimental errors estimation of the `` model of experiment '' .",
    "the energy measured with the cerenkov light flux method is used for estimation of the integral intensity of cosmic rays , since the experimental error of this method for individual event is at least 2 times smaller than that for the size / cldf method .",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the definition of the integral intensity is mainly due to the estimation of the threshold energy .",
    "the main contribution to it is the uncertainty in the size @xmath4 , which is evaluated as less than 6%  @xcite.this leads to an uncertaity of about 12% in the integral intensity .    the maximum systematic shift of calibration coefficient , connected with the lack of knowlege of the real mass composition ,",
    "was estimated with `` model of experiment '' assuming pure proton and pure iron compositions .",
    "the maximum error of about 8% is obtained for primary protons .",
    "we may estimate the maximum possible systematic uncertainty as a root mean square of the sum of squares of these two values .    to analyze the experimental data we used the events with reconstructed core positions inside the effective area of 100@xmath37100  m@xmath38 in the center of eas - top array , zenith angles less than 40@xmath39 and relative angles of the axis to the cherenkov average array pointing less than 34@xmath39 .",
    "100% efficiency for such events is reached at @xmath40  ev , as obtained with the `` model of experiment '' .",
    "a practical estimation of the stability of the integral intensity was obtained by dividing the whole staistics into two parts , one of them acquised during summer and autumn and another acquised during winter and early spring .",
    "the natural conditions of the experiment were quite different , but the difference in estimation of the reference integral intensity is 8% only , consistent with the possible statistical error ."

    "<S> a new method of a primary cosmic particle energy measurement with the extensive air shower ( eas ) technique has been developed by exploiting : a ) the joint analysis of the shower size , obtained by the eas - top array , and of the eas cherenkov light lateral distribution ( ldf ) , obtained by the quest array , and b ) simulations based on the corsika code . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the strict correlation between the size / energy ratio and the steepness of the cherenkov light lateral distribution and has been compared with a `` classical '' one based on the cherenkov light flux at a fixed distance ( 175 m ) from the eas core . the independence of the energy measurement both on the mass of primary particle and the hadronic interaction model used for the analysis is shown . </S>",
