    "in addition , as we will see , it may obscure one piece of the physics , which is that the instability that we seek to describe is a _ combined instability in flexural modes and electron density_. furthermore , interactions are easily seen to stabilize the system , hence we need to include them for any realistic theory , which makes integration over fermions in a first step even more problematic .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied in this article a model for graphene as an elastic membrane coupled to dirac electrons . by extending the model to @xmath1-component flexural phonons and @xmath4-component dirac fermions , we obtained a solvable limit for large @xmath1 , while retaining a lot of the physics , e.g.screening of non - linearities by thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "we derived the self consistent screening approximation ( scsa ) equations , which are extensions of the standard classical scsa equations to ( i ) the quantum membrane , and ( ii ) the coupled quantum membrane - electron problem .    by a careful study of the temperature dependence of the flexural bubble we obtained the first controlled description of the quantum to classical , and harmonic to anharmonic crossover for the problem of the membrane alone .",
    "we have analyzed , within the same approximation , the effect on the membrane of the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "we find that the electron excitations , i.e.  the electron - hole pairs , mix with the flexural modes , leading to collective excitations of hybrid character . for sufficiently large values of the electron - phonon coupling",
    ", new modes appear below the continuum of excitations made up of two flexural phonons . as the coupling",
    "is increased , the frequency of these modes goes to zero at a finite value of the momentum @xmath243 .",
    "if the coupling is increased further , the frequency of the modes within a range of finite momenta becomes imaginary , signalling a phase transition and the appearance of a broken symmetry phase .",
    "the instability appears first at momenta comparable with the high - momentum cutoff , of the order of the lattice spacing . as the electron - phonon coupling increases , the range of unstable modes shifts towards lower momenta .",
    "the character of these modes changes between mostly phonon - like to electron - like .",
    "we have found that the attractive interaction between electrons mediated by in - plane phonons greatly facilitates the transition which then occurs at lower and quite realistic values of the coupling .",
    "in addition , the transition is also found to be facilitated by screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "evidence for this instability was demonstrated in the @xmath6 limit .",
    "it is different from previous approaches , because it does not involve the renormalization of the bending rigidity @xcite and it does not rely on the effective young modulus becoming negative in some window of wave vectors @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to associate this transition to the spontaneous and simultaneous formation of ripples coupled to electronic puddles . to make this more precise",
    "we have derived the saddle - point equations , exact at @xmath6 , which allow us to study the transition and in principle to describe the rippled phase .",
    "it confirms that the instablility occurs at a finite wave - vector and mixes electronic and flexural degrees of freedom .",
    "the study of the coupled non - linear saddle - point equations which describe the rippled phase is however complicated , and left for the future .",
    "( it could be done either numerically or in some expansion , e.g.  for large coupling . ) .",
    "we have not studied here the renormalization of @xmath286 , which can be added and occurs to next order in @xmath5 .",
    "although we do not expect renormalization to qualitatively change the mechanism proposed here , it is likely to change the estimates for the transition .",
    "the results presented here confirm that the coupling between flexural modes and electron - hole pairs significantly changes the structural properties of graphene .",
    "the main changes , and the instability for sufficiently large couplings , occur at a finite momentum .",
    "hence , the results reported here should not be modified by the presence of a finite carrier concentration , provided that the square root of the density of carriers is small compared to the wave vector at which the instability takes place . on the other hand",
    ", the existence of a gap comparable to the bandwidth or the electronic cutoff will suppress the effects reported here .",
    "the two - dimensional material boron nitride is structurally very similar to graphene , but it has a larger gap in the electronic spectrum .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze the properties of free standing boron nitride .",
    "other two dimensional systems , like mos@xmath287 or mow@xmath287 are semiconductors with a small gap .",
    "their tendency towards ripple formation should be intermediate between that of graphene and of boron nitride .",
    "an interesting extension would be to apply our approach in the presence of a substrate .",
    "indeed it is known that graphene on many metallic substrates , where the coulomb interaction is screened , has long - ranged height corrugations @xcite .",
    "the study of these corrugations requires to add to our model the interaction between graphene and the substrate .",
