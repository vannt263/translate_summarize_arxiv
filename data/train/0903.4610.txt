    "it is also well known that the gauss - bonnet combination can reduce the number of spin-2 ghosts , which otherwise severely haunt the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the 4 dimensional gauss - bonnet term is a topological invariant , thus has no dynamical effects if added into the lagrangian linearly . to introduce extra dynamics ,",
    "one may couple the gauss - bonnet term to a scalar field , as naturally appears in low - energy string effective actions @xcite .",
    "for the exponential coupling with a scalar field potential , this model can produce a matter dominated period followed by an accelerated period @xcite .",

    "so in this case , all the 4 critical manifolds ( points or lines ) are at @xmath62 .",
    "re - calculating the eigenvalues , we find that , for @xmath78 , they are @xmath137 ; for @xmath90 , @xmath92 and @xmath91 , the eigenvalues containing @xmath138 disappear , compared to the 5 dimensional case .",
    "the @xmath102 eigenvalue for @xmath78 here is not related to any critical line , thus the stability of this isolated non - hyperbolic point may be obtained by the centre manifold method @xcite . since the eigenvalue containing @xmath138 for @xmath90 has vanished ,",
    "this point is either totally stable ( the system will stay in the matter dominated era for ever and not evolve to the dark energy dominated era . ) or extremely unstable ( the system can not stay in the matter dominated era for long enough to allow cosmic structure to form . ) .",
    "therefore this model is ruled out unless we allow extreme fine - tuning of initial conditions .",
    "the power - law model may be generalised to @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding curve @xmath10 and its first derivative @xmath139 for this model are respectively m(r)=q r + p-1 m(r)=q . to have a standard matter point , i.e. , to employ the relation ( [ constraint1 ] ) , we find it leads to a constraint equation for the parameters 2pq=1 .",
    "the system needs to be able to leave the matter point , which leads to a further constraint q>0 .",
    "thus if these constraints are satisfied , cosmologically viable trajectories can in principle be obtained .     with initial conditions",

    ". @xmath34 is the initial value of the scalar factor .",
    "note that we have to set @xmath15 very close to @xmath56 to obtain a long enough matter dominated period . when oscillating into the de sitter period , @xmath36 as well as @xmath37 go well below the @xmath145 divide.,width=585,height=278 ]     with initial conditions @xmath146 , @xmath141 , @xmath147 , @xmath143 and @xmath144.,width=585,height=278 ]    to be specific , we set @xmath148 and @xmath149 ( see fig .",
    "[ mofr2 ] ) and numerically solve this model to get cosmic trajectories . in fig .",
    "[ glambda ] , we obtain a trajectory that is ended with a stable de sitter era . for this trajectory",
    ", while the behaviours of @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath65 and @xmath37 are quite similar to those of the @xmath3cdm model in the radiation and matter dominated epochs , @xmath37 oscillates rapidly and goes deep into the phantom - like region as the universe enters the de sitter period . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath36 at first mimics the background fluids ( although oscillating significantly when leaving the radiation period ) , then at the end of the matter dominated epoch plunging below the @xmath145 divide for a while , thereafter increasing above the divide , and finally oscillating rapidly into the de sitter period . in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane , confined on the straight line @xmath152 , the universe slowly leaves the point @xmath62 towards the @xmath66 line , bounces back and forth and then goes into the stable de sitter point with @xmath74 .",
    "the reason why @xmath36 as well as @xmath37 oscillate rapidly when the system enters the de sitter period is related to the fact that the line @xmath66 actually corresponds to the bifurcation point of @xmath51 , similar to the bifurcation point of @xmath52 that is discussed in details in section [ analy ] . to see this",
    ", we express the last two eigenvalues of @xmath78 in terms of @xmath15 , - , and we find that these eigenvalues have divergent imaginary parts if @xmath153 .",

    "[ glambda1 ] . in this case",
    ", @xmath36 oscillates rapidly in the radiation and matter dominated epochs , then plunges well below the @xmath145 divide at the end of the matter dominated epoch and thereafter shortly passes nearby the de sitter point @xmath78 ( with rapid oscillation ) and the point @xmath92 with @xmath154 before going into the stable phantom - like point . in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane",
    "s view , the system slowly leaves the point @xmath62 towards the @xmath66 line and then bounces back and falls onto the point @xmath62 .",
    "we have also surveyed several other cases .",
    "the forms of these models , the corresponding @xmath10 ( see fig .  [ mofr2 ] ) and the constraint of the parameters from eq .",
    "( [ constraint1 ] ) are listed below : f(g ) = g^p + g^q : & m(r)=p + q-1 + pq / r , & p=1/2 , + f(g ) = g^p exp(g ) : & m(r)=-r + p / r , & p=1/2 , + f(g ) = g^p exp(/g ) : & m(r)=-r - p / r-2 , & p=1/2 , + f(g ) = g^p[ln(g)]^q : & m(r)=a(r)/qr , & p=1/2,where @xmath155 .",
    "the model @xmath156 is ruled out ( if extreme fine - tuning of initial conditions is not allowed ) because the condition ( [ slow2 ] ) can not be satisfied ,",
    "i.e. , the corresponding @xmath10 curve approaches the point @xmath157 from a forbidden direction .",
    "for the other models , it is easy to produce an elongated matter dominated epoch following a radiation dominated epoch , but we find it difficult for the cosmic trajectory to evolve to a final stable accelerated epoch after the standard matter dominated epoch .",
    "in this paper we have derived conditions for cosmologically viable @xmath1 models . by recasting the field equations of @xmath1 gravity with a flat robertson - walker metric into a 5 dimensional autonomous system ,",
    "we have seen that the equilibria of the system are not isolated but form so - called equilibrium manifolds ( in the present case they are @xmath55 dimensional lines , called critical lines . ) .",
    "we have shown that the emergence of the critical lines is not totally due to the fact that the 5 dimensional autonomous system can in principle be reduced to a 4 dimensional one .",
    "discovering @xmath158 critical lines in the phase space for a general @xmath1 model , the curved line @xmath54 is found to connect to the other 3 straight lines , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we have also found that for all @xmath158 lines the stability of a critical point changes when moving along the critical line , which may be referred to as bifurcation without parameters .",
    "for the critical line @xmath52 ( or @xmath53 ) in which the dark energy density scales with that of matter ( or radiation ) , matter ( or radiation ) becomes dominant only if the parameter of the critical line @xmath101 is around @xmath102 . at the same time , the stability of the critical line changes rapidly around @xmath96 , and we require @xmath98 to avoid a violent instability ( i.e. , to avoid extreme fine - tuning of the initial conditions ) .",
    "similar to the case of @xmath2 , for a specific @xmath1 model , we can construct the @xmath10 curve in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane . in this plane , @xmath52 , @xmath54 and",
    "@xmath53 all lie at the point @xmath62 .",
    "thus for a standard matter point @xmath90 ( on @xmath52 ) to exist , we require the @xmath10 curve satisfy the relation ( [ constraint1 ] ) : @xmath159 the condition ( [ slow2 ] ) : @xmath160 is also employed to let the universe finally leave the matter dominated point , which corresponds to some forbidden directions around the point @xmath62 in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane .",
    "the stable condition for the de sitter point @xmath78 ( on @xmath51 ) corresponds to the area enclosed by the curve @xmath83 and the @xmath15 axis in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane , in which the area enclosed by the curve @xmath82 and the @xmath15 axis corresponds to a stable spiral ( in a 2 dimensional subspace ) with the rest corresponding to a stable node .",
    "@xmath92 ( on @xmath54 ) is a dark energy dominated point .",
    "it has a wealth of possibilities . besides mimicking radiation when @xmath111 and matter when @xmath112",
    ", it can be a stable quintessence - like point or a stable phantom - like point .",
    "but if we require a standard matter epoch ( requiring the condition ( [ slow2 ] ) to hold unless we allow extreme fine - tuning of initial conditions ) , it can only be stable as a phantom - like point .",
    "which stable accelerated point the universe finally evolves to , the de sitter point @xmath78 or the phantom - like point @xmath92 , depends on the initial conditions .",
    "we have also studied several toy models of @xmath1 dark energy whose @xmath10 curves can be obtained analytically . note that if the analytical form of @xmath10 can not be obtained , one may obtain it numerically . on the other hand ,",
    "if a form of @xmath10 can be obtained from observations or other kinds of analyses , it may not be easy to derive the corresponding @xmath1 , but still we might find it numerically . for the model @xmath46 in particular , cosmologically viable trajectories have been obtained for the case with a de sitter epoch as the final stage as well as for the case with a phantom - like epoch as the final stage .",
    "these trajectories mimic the @xmath3cdm scenario in the radiation and matter dominated periods ( although @xmath36 may oscillate for a certain period ) but have distinctive signatures at late times .",
    "most significantly , @xmath36 plunges below the @xmath145 divide in the late matter dominated epoch ( pole - like behaviour , for similar behaviours of @xmath36 in other scenarios see @xcite ) and then oscillates rapidly , also going below the @xmath145 divide , when evolving to ( for the case with a de sitter epoch as the final stage ) or passing nearby ( for the case with a phantom - like epoch as the final stage ) the de sitter point @xmath78 . for other potentially viable models ,",
    "cosmologically viable trajectories may still exist , but we find it is non - trivial to obtain them .",
