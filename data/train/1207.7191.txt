    "cluster and halo states in light nuclei have been studied for several decades @xcite .",
    "these structures are to a large extent decoupled from more complicated many - body states since they occupy essentially separate parts of the hilbert space .",
    "the descriptions of these cluster structures are usually in terms of few - body correlations , i.e. , two or three almost inert clusters interacting through effective potentials .",
    "these constituent clusters are themselves nuclear systems .",
    "thus , the full nuclear many - body system is described by separate relative and internal cluster degrees of freedom .",
    "the first and most important step for halo states is then to freeze the internal motion in a given structure , and solve the remaining relative motion .",
    "bound states are only a small part of the possible quantum structures of a given many - body system . among",
    "the infinitely many continuum states one can find resonances , still by definition in the continuum , but that can be understood as a discrete continuation of the set of bound state structures . as the excitation energy increases it is expected that the underlying assumption of uncoupled internal and relative cluster motion becomes increasingly violated .",
    "however , a number of low - lying many - body resonances in light nuclei can still be well described as cluster structures even when they appear in the continuum .",
    "prominent examples are found in stable nuclei like @xmath0c and @xmath12be @xcite , but even ground states like in @xmath13be @xcite and @xmath1li @xcite may appear as resonances .    a number of beta unstable light nuclei exhibit particle stable bound cluster states , f.ex .",
    "@xmath14li @xcite , @xmath15ne @xcite and @xmath0be @xcite . in many cases the bound states",
    "are well established , but very often their particle unstable spectrum is much less known due to practical experimental difficulties .",
    "the excited @xmath16 state in @xmath14li is a clear example @xcite .",
    "an interesting point is that very often the neutron dripline has states of a unique structure . in particular",
    ", @xmath14be is a nucleus with two bound states , both with a two - body halo structure .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0be is rather well bound but three halo states appear as excited states , and @xmath17be is particle unbound , whereas @xmath18be has one particle - bound state @xcite .",
    "the complicated dripline structure for the be - isotopes is primarily due to the second @xmath8-state intruder and eventual inversion with the @xmath7-state in @xmath14be @xcite .",
    "correlations of the valence neutrons in a larger space result in unusually many bound states compared to other light dripline nuclei .    beside the bound ( halo ) states in @xmath0be ,",
    "a @xmath19-state has been suggested @xcite , looked for in experiments , but so far not found as a bound state .",
    "the structure of the effective potentials in the three - body problem of @xmath0be ( @xmath1be@xmath20 ) is complicated and suggesting more excited states than the known bound states .",
    "the one - neutron threshold is lower than the two - neutron threshold , implying that a resonance of one - body nature could appear between the two thresholds .",
    "its structure would then at large distance have to be one neutron far away from @xmath14be either in the ground or the excited state .",
    "there has been very little experimental investigations of the resonances in @xmath0be .",
    "two resonances were seen in a @xmath1be(t , p)@xmath0be experiment by fortune et al .",
    "@xcite , which was later confirmed by bohlen et al . @xcite .",
    "the energy and width were measured , and set to @xmath9  mev and @xmath10  mev above the two - neutron threshold .",
    "the strong population of the resonances in a two neutron transfer indicates a natural parity @xmath21 , and tentatively quantum numbers were given from dwba calculations .",
    "it seems to be very appropriate to extend the theoretical bound state study of @xmath0be to the continuum .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the low - lying resonance structure of @xmath0be . in section",
    "ii we very briefly sketch the method , the previously applied effective @xmath1be - neutron interactions , and the adiabatic @xmath0be potentials . in section  iii , we present resonance energies and their quantum numbers . in section",
    "iv , we discuss the resonance structures . in section",
    "v , we discuss the production and decay modes of the resonances and compare our results with known experimental data . finally , in section vi we give a short summary and the corresponding conclusions .",
    "the theoretical framework has been previously well described and successfully applied @xcite .",
    "we only briefly sketch to define notation and interactions .",
    "the resulting adiabatic potentials are the basic ingredients in the subsequent calculations .",
    "we use the adiabatic hyperspherical expansion method to calculate the three - body properties of the system in question , that is @xmath0be ( @xmath1be@xmath20 ) .",
    "this method strictly deals with three entities treated as point - like particles interacting pairwise with each other @xcite .",
    "the faddeev equations are first formulated in hyperspherical coordinates which consists of the hyperradius , @xmath22 , and five angles collectively named @xmath23 .",
    "assuming that the two - body interactions are known , we can solve the angular part of the faddeev equations for fixed hyperradius . due to",
    "the restriction of finite intervals for all five angular coordinates the eigenvalue spectrum is discrete , although in principle with infinitely many elements .",
    "the angular solutions form a complete set which is exploited as a basis for expansion of the total wave function .",
    "this provides finally a coupled set of one - dimensional hyperradial equations .",
    "the details of the method are discussed in @xcite .",
    "bound states are solutions to the radial equation with an exponentially falling radial large - distance behavior .",
    "resonances are solutions to the same hyperradial equations but with boundary conditions corresponding to only outgoing waves .",
    "we apply the complex rotation method on the hyperspherical coordinates , that is only the hyperradius is scaled by @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the resonance boundary conditions are then transformed to an exponential fall - off , precisely as the bound states , provided the rotation angle , @xmath25 , exceeds @xmath26 , which is the value corresponding to rotation of the real - energy axis to the position of the resonance , @xmath27 .",
    "we have here denoted the real and imaginary values of the resonance energy by @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the two - body interactions between the two neutrons and between neutron and @xmath1be can be chosen through different criteria .",
    "they are all related to the corresponding two - body properties of bound states and/or resonances .",
    "the crucial pieces are the @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6-wave interactions .",
    "the neutron - neutron interaction from @xcite reproduces low - energy scattering properties for the different partial waves . for neutron-@xmath1be , we choose effective potentials for each set of quantum numbers such that the lowest computed energy reproduces the bound state or resonance energy .",
    "in particular , we use the interaction labeled i in @xcite , where the central and spin - orbit radial potentials are assumed to have a gaussian shape .",
    "the range of this interaction for all the partial waves is taken equal to 3.5 fm , that is the sum of the rms radius of the core and the radius of the neutron .",
    "for @xmath8-waves the strength is fixed to fit the experimental neutron separation energy of the @xmath30-state in @xmath14be ( @xmath31 mev ) . for @xmath7-waves the two free parameters ( central and spin - orbit strengths )",
    "are adjusted to reproduce the experimental neutron separation energy of the @xmath32-state in @xmath14be ( @xmath33 mev ) , and simultaneously push up the @xmath34 state , which is forbidden by the pauli principle , since it is occupied by the four neutrons in the @xmath1be core .",
    "for the @xmath6-states it is well established that @xmath14be has a @xmath35 resonance at 1.28 mev ( energy above threshold ) , and the most likely candidate as spin - orbit partner of the 5/2@xmath36 state is the known 3/2@xmath36-resonance at 2.90 mev ( above threshold ) @xcite .",
    "simultaneous matching of these two resonances ( and the corresponding widths ) leads to central and spin - orbit radial potentials for @xmath6-waves made as a sum of two gaussians .",
    "further details about the interaction are discussed in @xcite .",
    "typically , in a three - body calculation an effective three - body force is introduced in the coupled set of radial equations in order to fine tune the properties of the three - body system @xcite .",
    "this potential can be understood as the way to take care of all those effects that go beyond the two - body interactions . in our calculations",
    "we have used a gaussian three - body force , whose range has been taken equal to 4.25 fm , that is the hyperradius corresponding to a @xmath1be - core and two neutrons touching each other .",
    "the strength of the gaussian is used to adjust the energy of the computed resonance .",
    "once this is done , the width is determined by the potential barrier ( height and thickness ) at that precise energy .",
    "a change of the range in the three - body potential could affect the properties of the barrier ( and therefore the width of the resonance ) , but a modest change produces only very modest variations of the width .",
    "this is because the strength is adjusted to maintain the energy which is the crucially important quantity determining the width .",
    "thus the conclusions reached in this work would still hold .",
    "the solutions to the complex rotated angular equations provide the set of complex hyperradial adiabatic potentials whose real parts are shown in fig.[fig1 ] for each of the most interesting sets of angular momentum and parity .",
    "most of these potentials approach zero at large distances",
    ". however , several of them approach values less than or larger than zero .",
    "these asymptotic energies are two - body bound state or resonance energies corresponding to two particles in those relative states while the third particle is far away . below zero",
    "it must be the @xmath37 or @xmath38 bound states of @xmath14be at respectively @xmath31  mev and @xmath33  mev . above zero",
    "it must be the @xmath39 or @xmath40-resonances , respectively at @xmath41  mev and @xmath42  mev above the three - body threshold @xcite .    at smaller distances ,",
    "all the potentials diverge towards @xmath43 , and at finite , but relatively small distances , a substantial amount of structure is present .",
    "the attractive pockets are responsible for structures like three - body bound states or resonances .",
    "if all potentials are repulsive at all distances , no structure can arise and all three particles would try to get as far from each other as possible .",
    "the @xmath19 set of potentials are the simplest as only one of the potentials exhibits some attraction .",
    "however , this level crosses , or rather avoids crossing , another purely repulsive level when @xmath22 is about 15  fm .",
    "the large - distance asymptotics of these two crossing levels then correspond to the @xmath14be in the @xmath37 or @xmath38 bound states and the last neutron spatially far away corresponding in @xmath38 or @xmath37-states with respect to the center of mass of the @xmath14be states . only these combinations are allowed since the total angular momentum and parity , @xmath19 , has to arise after coupling of these angular momenta .",
    "thus , the attractive pocket seems to be mostly of @xmath14be(@xmath38 ) character , since this configuration is reached by the smooth continuation of the attractive structure to large distances beyond the avoided crossing .",
    "the @xmath3 set of potentials are also relatively simple with only two potentials with attractive pockets where the thickest and deepest resembles the lowest @xmath19 potential . also for @xmath3 , this potential avoids crossing another potential , and together they form the same large - distance asymptotic structure as the two lowest @xmath19 potentials .",
    "the only difference is that the @xmath37 and @xmath38 angular momenta now are coupled to @xmath3 .",
    "the other potential with an attractive pocket is thinner and rather steeply increasing to `` avoid crossing '' a number of other potentials where the first is the purely repulsive potential ending up as the lowest at large distance .",
    "this potential therefore has a barrier , and consequently it may be able to hold a resonance . due to the possibly complicated rearrangements of structures at crossings the decay path and resulting decay channels can not be derived by inspection of these potentials .",
    "both @xmath5 and @xmath4 sets of potentials are much more structured . now",
    "four potentials have attractive pockets at small distances and each has fast small - scale variation arising from crossings at these hyperradii .",
    "the two large - distance @xmath14be structures are again for both @xmath5 and @xmath4 found as potentials approaching @xmath31  mev and @xmath33  mev .",
    "for @xmath5 the last neutron is then in @xmath37 or @xmath38 states relative to @xmath14be(@xmath37 ) or @xmath14be(@xmath38 ) . for @xmath4 ,",
    "three negative states appear at large distance with the last neutron in the @xmath40 , @xmath39 or in the @xmath44 state relative to the two bound states of @xmath14be .",
    "the complicated structures of the potentials do not allow quick predictions of occurrence of bound states or resonances and their structure or decay properties .",
    "detailed investigations must be carried out .",
    "the potentials in fig.[fig1 ] are applied to the coupled set of hyperradial equations . bound state energies are then first obtained as described in details in @xcite , that is the experimentally known ground state of @xmath5 , and the excited states of @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in precisely the same framework a @xmath19 state",
    "was also found @xcite .",
    "so far , this state has not been seen in experiments .",
    "the same basic interactions that produced the adiabatic potentials in fig.[fig1 ] are also able to support resonances .",
    "they are computed by the complex scaling technique @xcite as poles of the @xmath45-matrix .",
    "the precise positions can not be reliably obtained since polarization effects are excluded beyond the two - body level , and contributions from other neglected degrees of freedom can be crucial . to mock up effects of these omissions",
    "we tune the real parts of the three - body energies to an a priori chosen value .",
    "the imaginary part , or equivalently the width of the states , then follow without further adjustment .",
    "the attractive pocket for @xmath19 in fig.[fig1 ] is sufficiently strong to support the bound state suggested in @xcite , although no experimental evidence of it has been found so far .",
    "the reason for this can be either because its population in reactions is extremely small , or it is hidden behind the other states , or it is for some reason pushed up into the continuum .",
    "we investigate consequences of the last option where both one - body ( @xmath14be + n ) and",
    "two - body ( @xmath1be + n + n ) continuum structures in principle are possible .    in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we show the @xmath19 complex energy spectrum where the repulsion of the three - body interaction is increased from zero .",
    "the spectrum with zero repulsion is shown by the crosses in the figure , where a @xmath19 bound state appears at an energy of about @xmath46 mev .",
    "the closed circles show the spectrum when the three - body repulsion is gradually increased .",
    "we see that the first threshold , ground state of @xmath14be , is approached when the real part of the energy corresponds to a true bound state and the imaginary part is zero . passing the threshold",
    "allows a finite imaginary part of the energy , which very quickly increases , and very soon disappears in the rotated continuum threshold .",
    "the result is that this emerging neutron-@xmath14be one - body resonance state is dissolved in this continuum .",
    "it can then stay in the continuum with a large width or continue to rotate and end up as a virtual state on another riemann sheet with zero imaginary energy .",
    "we can not decide with the present amount of information . in any case",
    ", we can not move the resonance to even higher values , approaching or passing , the next two thresholds .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath19 state is either bound , a very broad resonance structure , or a virtual state only revealing itself via an attractive potential .    in fig.[fig3 ]",
    "we show the @xmath3 complex energy spectrum in @xmath0be .",
    "now , together with the three down sloping lines for the one - neutron and two - neutron threshold , we also show the two lines corresponding to the rotated thresholds for the @xmath40 and @xmath39 resonances in @xmath14be .",
    "these two thresholds are present in the @xmath16 states , which makes the spectrum more complicated than for the @xmath19 states . when no three - body interaction is used , the @xmath16 spectrum gives rise to one bound state close to @xmath46 mev , and to a resonance at a complex energy of @xmath47 mev , which are indicated by the crosses in the figure .",
    "the signature of the resonance is a numerically stable and distinguishable point outside all the rotated continuum thresholds .",
    "an additional attraction , in particular the one provided by an effective three - body force , moves down the resonance towards the three - body threshold .",
    "it is then not difficult to adjust this attractive force to fit the known experimental resonance energies in @xmath0be .",
    "when adjusting the energy to 2.0 mev the computed width is of about 0.50 mev , clearly larger than the corresponding experimental width of 0.09 mev given in @xcite . when fitting the energy to 0.9 mev , the computed width is of 0.22 mev , a factor of 2 larger than the experimental width quoted in @xcite for this resonance .",
    "this last spectrum is the one shown by the closed circles in fig .",
    "this size order is in general not allowing for contributions from configurations omitted in the three - body model .    in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "we show the @xmath5 complex energy spectrum which gives rise to two bound states ( only one shown in the figure ) .",
    "however , both the potentials in fig.[fig1 ] and the present spectrum are more complicated than those of the @xmath19 states .",
    "the properties of the spectrum are qualitatively very similar to those described for the @xmath3 states , but now the computed resonance energy without three - body potential is 1.97  mev .",
    "the crosses in the figure indicate this resonance and one of the bound states .",
    "this resonance energy already matches one of the experimental known energies , although again the computed width ( 0.70 mev ) is clearly larger than the experimental one . moving this resonance down by use of an attractive three - body potential it is also possible to place the resonance at 0.89 mev , but again the computed width of 0.32 mev is clearly larger than the experimental one , now a factor of three larger .",
    "the corresponding full spectrum is shown by the closed circles in the figure .    in fig.[fig5",
    "] we show the @xmath4 complex energy spectrum which gives rise to one bound state .",
    "again , we notice that both the potentials in fig.[fig1 ] and the present spectrum are more complicated than those of the @xmath19 states .",
    "the properties of the spectrum are again qualitatively very similar to those of the @xmath5 and @xmath3 states .",
    "the resonance position without three - body potential is now around @xmath48  mev ( crosses in the figure ) .",
    "however , in this case the attractive three - body potential now has to be exceedingly strong to move the position down to @xmath49  mev .",
    "for this reason , our calculation excludes the assignment of the spin and parity @xmath50 for the resonance experimentally known to be around this energy .",
    "even more , a moderate strength would place the resonance not much lower than about 2.8 mev , and having a width of 0.7 mev .",
    "this is the spectrum shown by the solid circles in the figure .",
    "this computed resonance could at most be compatible with the second reported measured resonance of the same energy with a much smaller width of about @xmath51  mev @xcite , but more likely it would be more suitable for a higher lying resonance , a possible candidate were observed at @xmath11  mev by bohlen et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".computed energies and widths ( both in mev ) for different angular momenta and parity states in @xmath0be .",
    "the second column is the result without inclusion of a three - body force . in the third and fourth columns",
    "a three - body force has been included to fit the computed energy to the ones known experimentally @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab5 ]    the angular momenta and parities of the experimentally observed resonances are not known , although in some cases their values are suggested as the most likely according to the experimental conditions .",
    "the energies chosen for each of the resonances computed in this work meet these conditions , and we therefore calculate branching ratios for the @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 resonances each of them placed at two different energies .",
    "the computed branching ratios for each of them are given in table  [ tab5 ] , where the energy and width of each resonance @xmath52 ) is given in mev .",
    "the decay channels denoted by `` @xmath53+n '' and `` @xmath54+n '' represent emission of one neutron plus @xmath14be either in the ground state or in its bound excited state .",
    "the direct decay into the three - body continuum , with the @xmath1be core in the @xmath55 ground state , is denoted by `` @xmath55+n+n '' .",
    "finally , `` @xmath56+n '' and `` @xmath57+n '' correspond to sequential decay through the @xmath56 and @xmath57 resonances in @xmath14be , which eventually decay into the two - body continuum of @xmath1be and a neutron .",
    "for @xmath5 resonance at @xmath58 mev the preferred decay channels are either one - neutron decay to the excited @xmath32 state of @xmath14be or direct decay to the three - body continuum .",
    "only about 8.6% of the decay takes place through the ground state of @xmath14be . for the higher energy of @xmath59  mev ,",
    "since the energy of the @xmath35 resonance in @xmath14be is 1.28 mev , the probability for sequential decay through this resonance now becomes prominent .",
    "the direct decay is also increased at the expense of the one - neutron decay branch , that reduces from about 58% to about 14% , and where in particular the decay through the ground state of @xmath14be almost disappears .",
    "if the lowest resonance at about 0.9 mev is a @xmath3 state , we find that most decays proceed by one - neutron emission to the excited @xmath14be state and a smaller but significant fraction decays to the @xmath14be ground state .",
    "the direct decay into the continuum amounts only to about 8% .",
    "if the @xmath3 state is at about @xmath60  mev the branching ratios are even larger for decay into the excited @xmath14be state and less than @xmath61 into the ground state , while the direct decay remains around @xmath62 .",
    "the lowest resonance have been seen in a d(@xmath14be , p)@xmath0be experiment at isolde , by gating on the gamma from the sequential decay through the @xmath32 bound state in @xmath14be @xcite .",
    "this is the first experiment in which a given decay channel from a resonance in @xmath0be has been singled out , and could open up for branching ratio measurement , but the analysis is still ongoing .",
    "a measurement of the branching ratio will give a strong indication of the quantum numbers of the resonances .",
    "as we can see , the @xmath0be resonance at about 0.9 mev and the one about 2.0 mev would have rather different decay branching ratios depending on which of them is the @xmath55 state and which the @xmath16 state .",
    "a 0@xmath36 state would decay with a large component of direct decay into the continuum .",
    "this component reduces drastically in the case of the @xmath16 resonance , that clearly prefers to decay through the @xmath32 state in @xmath14be .",
    "the calculated @xmath4 resonance is naturally placed at a higher energy , or alternatively predominantly of a non - three body structure . for an energy of @xmath63  mev the dominating decay channel is direct decay or sequential decays through either @xmath64 or @xmath35 resonances in @xmath14be . for a lower energy of @xmath65",
    "mev the direct decay is even more dominating , while decay to the ground state has increased at the expense of the sequential decay through the high - lying @xmath64 resonance , which for energy reasons disappears ( the energy of @xmath64 resonance in @xmath14be is 2.90 mev ) .",
    "while the decay of the resonances of @xmath0be are still to be measured , the continuum of @xmath0be has been probed in both neutron transfer and charge exchange experiments .",
    "so far only two experiments have been able to clearly identify any resonances @xcite , and the information is limited to excitation energy and width .",
    "both experiments show clear resonances at @xmath9  mev and @xmath10  mev , and tentatively quantum numbers of @xmath50 and @xmath55 or @xmath66 is suggested from dwba calculations . a large peak at @xmath11  mev seen in the @xmath67be(@xmath0c,@xmath12c)@xmath0be experiment @xcite strongly indicates of a third resonance .",
    "unfortunately this resonance can not be confirmed by the @xmath1be(t , p)@xmath0be reaction @xcite due to limits in the energy range . a resonance at @xmath11  mev would be a good candidate for the predicted @xmath50 .",
    "the probability of populating a resonance in a transfer reaction is dependent on the overlap between the total wave function of the resonance and the configuration probed by the reaction .",
    "take ( t , p ) as an example , assuming a direct reaction , the two - neutrons from a relative @xmath8-state in the triton would prefer an @xmath8-wave in the first jacobi system . comparing this configuration with the total wave function can be done by looking at the weights in tables  [ tab1]-[tab3 ] . here",
    "@xmath5 is dominated by @xmath8-wave of @xmath68 , twice as large as @xmath3 with @xmath69 while @xmath4 is reduced by an additional factor of @xmath70 to about @xmath71 .",
    "this indicates a larger probability of probing a @xmath55 than a @xmath16 and especially a @xmath50 resonance in a ( t , p ) reaction .",
    "these weights have been calculated for the bound states by romero - redondo et al @xcite to be @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 for he @xmath75 , @xmath50 , @xmath16 states .",
    "the weights predict a stronger population of the @xmath55 ground state and the bound @xmath50 than the population of the bound @xmath16 .",
    "these findings are consistent with the ( t , p ) measurement of fortune , @xcite .",
    "the strong population of the two resonances in the experiment is then not favored by the suggested @xmath50 structure , which indicate only very weak population .",
    "the suggested quantum numbers of @xmath55 for the lowest resonance and @xmath16 for the second is more consistent with the large population of especially the lowest resonance .",
    "sequential transfers through @xmath14be could also occur , and distort the picture .",
    "whether the reaction is direct or sequential can not be distinguished experimentally , but information from a ( d , p ) reaction might be helpful .",
    "a similar comparison can be made for a ( d , p ) reaction . again assuming the simplest possible reaction , adding one neutron to the ground state of @xmath14be . in this case",
    "all weights are around @xmath76 , which indicates that contributions from higher order reactions would be competitive .",
    "in fact for all three sets of quantum numbers @xmath77 an excitation to the @xmath6-shell is required to get more than @xmath61 weight , hence coupling to these continuum states should be taken into account in any reaction calculation .",
    "this is supported by a scattering experiment with @xmath14be on @xmath78zn which shows a large break up channel for @xmath14be @xcite .",
    "a ( d , p ) reaction could also be used to populate the predicted @xmath79 state around the one neutron threshold , as the reaction does not favor natural parity states .",
    "comparing the strengths for the simplest reactions to populate a @xmath79 from a ( t , p ) and ( d , p ) reaction respectively can be done by comparing the weights in tab  [ tab4b ] . here the weights for the ( t , p ) is less than @xmath76 while it is @xmath80 for a ( d , p ) .",
    "therefore a population in a ( t , p ) should be very weak , nonetheless an indication of a broad weakly populated resonance at @xmath81  mev is seen in the ( t , p ) reaction by fortune , @xcite .",
    "the peak is to very weak , but if it is indeed a resonance , it should be populated and seen in a ( d , p ) measurement .    further improved experimental investigations would help to test the validity of the model interpretation .",
    "this includes measurements of both population and decay of the channels .",
    "we employ the technique of hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method combined with complex coordinate scaling .",
    "we investigate the continuum states , mostly resonances , of @xmath0be in a three - body model where the constituents are two neutrons and @xmath1be .",
    "the previously known four bound states are fairly well described in such a model .",
    "this therefore already determines a successful set of two - body interactions , which are now used in an extension to study low - lying continuum states above the three - body breakup threshold .",
    "the most probable angular momenta and parities are @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we first compute a series of the lowest adiabatic potentials with these quantum numbers .",
    "they exhibit lots of structure and several potentials have attractive regions at small distance .",
    "this already indicates possible bound states or resonances with corresponding properties .",
    "the energies are in principle found as solutions to the hyperradial equations but the three - body model can not be expected to provide precise energies .",
    "therefore we fine - tune with a three - body potential which moves the bound states / resonances up or down .",
    "the widths of the resonances are then correlated with the resonance position .",
    "we should here remember that our computed width should be larger than the measured value because we only have the three - body component in the model .",
    "any additional components would tend to reduce the computed width .",
    "the naturally occurring lowest of these states is the @xmath19 bound state .",
    "so far it has not been found experimentally and perhaps it instead is pushed up above the one- or perhaps even the two - neutron threshold . in attempts to move the energy from a bound to an unbound state , we find that the width increases dramatically just above the lowest one - neutron emission threshold .",
    "the structure of the state then corresponds to a coherent combination of @xmath14be in the ground state surrounded by one neutron and a genuine three - body structure .",
    "quickly it becomes impossible to trace the resonance which could turn into either a virtual state or a very broad neutron-@xmath14be resonance .",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath5 resonances can rather easily be placed at the positions of the two lowest resonances at about @xmath49  mev and @xmath82  mev above the three - body threshold .",
    "it is then natural to associate these quantum numbers with these resonances .",
    "the width comparison to measured values suggest that @xmath5 is the lowest state at about @xmath9  mev and @xmath3 is at @xmath10  mev , but the opposite can not be excluded .",
    "the @xmath4 state also appears as a resonance but it requires a very strong three - body attraction to pull it down to these low energies .",
    "it is then natural to associate this state with a higher - lying resonance at about @xmath63  mev .",
    "we calculate the structure of these resonances expressed as partial - wave decomposed configurations .",
    "the neutron - neutron relative wave functions are mixtures of @xmath8 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6-waves whereas the neutron-@xmath14be relative wave functions consists of essentially only @xmath6-waves for the @xmath5 and @xmath4 resonances , and both @xmath7 and @xmath6-waves for the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the assignment of quantum numbers requires additional information .",
    "the lowest - lying resonances have for some time tentatively been assigned to @xmath4 .",
    "the present model rather suggest @xmath3 and @xmath5 . to find further evidence we calculate the branching ratios for decays into different channels .",
    "these quantities are observables and could help to confirm assignments of angular momentum and parity .",
    "we find several coexisting decay channels for all three resonances depending on which energy position is chosen .",
    "channels like one - neutron , three - body direct as well as three - body sequential via different @xmath14be resonances are all possible",
    ".    the detailed comparison to measured results must unfortunately include calculations of transfer cross sections .",
    "this would provide information about population of the resonances which in combination with our branching ratios could distinguish between different angular momentum and parity assignments .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the low - lying three - body resonance structure of @xmath0be .",
    "partial wave decomposition for small as well as large distances are now available for this model .",
    "we find surprisingly many different resonances and bound states for such a light neutron dripline nucleus .",
    "the computed structures can now be compared to measurements . our results and the available data are all consistent with @xmath55 at @xmath9  mev , @xmath16 at @xmath10  mev and @xmath50 at @xmath11  mev .",
    "this problem was suggested by h. fynbo and k. riisager in connection with detailed analysis of experiments of neutron transfer from deuteron to @xmath14be .",
    "we appreciate the information from numerous discussions .",
    "this work was partly supported by funds provided by dgi of mineco under contract no .",
