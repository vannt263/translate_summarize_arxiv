    "it is already three decades since the first detection of solar neutrinos .",
    "it was realized from the very beginning that the observed rate at the homestake experiment @xcite was far lower than the theoretical expectation based on the standard solar model @xcite with the implicit assumption that neutrinos created in the solar interior reach the earth unchanged , i.e. they are massless and have only standard properties and interactions . in the first two decades of solar neutrino research ,",
    "the problem consisted only of the discrepancy between theoretical expectations based upon solar model calculations and the observations of the capture rate in the chlorine solar neutrino experiment .",
    "this discrepancy led to a change in the original goal of using solar neutrinos to probe the properties of the solar interior towards the study of the properties of the neutrino itself .    from the experimental point of view",
    "much progress has been done in recent years .",
    "we now have available the results of five experiments , the original chlorine experiment at homestake @xcite , the radio chemical gallium experiments on pp neutrinos , gallex @xcite and sage  @xcite , and the water cherenkov detectors kamiokande  @xcite and super ",
    "kamiokande @xcite .",
    "the latter has been able not only to confirm the original detection of solar neutrinos at lower rates than predicted by standard solar models , but also to demonstrate directly that the neutrinos come from the sun by showing that recoil electrons are scattered in the direction along the sun - earth axis .",
    "we now have good information on the time dependence of the event rates during the day and night , as well as a measurement of the recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "after 825 days of operation , super ",
    "kamiokande has also presented preliminary results on the seasonal variation of the neutrino event rates , an issue which will become important in discriminating the msw scenario from the possibility of neutrino oscillations in vacuum  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "there has been improvement on solar modelling and nuclear cross sections .",
    "for example , helioseismological observations have now established that diffusion is occurring and by now most solar models incorporate the effects of helium and heavy element diffusion  @xcite .",
    "the quality of the experiments themselves and the robustness of the theory make us confident that in order to describe the data one must depart from the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics interactions , by endowing neutrinos with new properties . in theories beyond the standard model of particle physics neutrinos",
    "may naturally have exotic properties such as non - orthonormality  @xcite , flavour - changing interactions  @xcite , transition magnetic moments  @xcite and neutrino decays  @xcite , the most generic is the existence of mass .",
    "while many of these may play a role in neutrino propagation and therefore in the explanation of the data  @xcite it is undeniable that the most generic and popular explanation of the solar neutrino anomaly is in terms of neutrino masses and mixing leading to neutrino oscillations either in _ vacuum _  @xcite or via the matter - enhanced _ msw mechanism",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the implications of the present data on solar neutrinos in the framework of the two - flavor msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "we perform a global fit to the full data set corresponding to 825 days of data of the super  kamiokande experiment as well as to chlorine , gallex and sage . in our analysis",
    "we use as ssm the latest results from the most accurate calculation of neutrino fluxes by bahcall and pinsonneault @xcite which incorporates the new normalization for the low energy cross section @xmath17 indicated by the recent studies at the institute of nuclear theory  @xcite .",
    "we have also considered the possibility of departing from the ssm of bp98 by allowing a free normalization of the @xmath11 flux and @xmath12 neutrino fluxes and we present the results we obtain when we treat these normalization as free parameters .",
    "we combined the measured total event rates at chlorine , gallium and super  kamiokande experiments with the super  kamiokande data on the zenith angle dependence , energy spectrum and seasonal variation of the events .",
    "the goal of such analysis is not only to compare the quality of the solutions to the solar neutrino anomaly in terms of flavour oscillations of @xmath0 into active or sterile neutrinos but also to study the weight of different observables on the determination of the underlying neutrino physics parameters as emphasized in ref .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we present the basic elements that enter into our calculation of the observables and the definitions used in the statistical combination of the data .",

    "our results show that for oscillation into active neutrinos although the data on the total event rates favours the sma angle solution , once the full data set is included both sma and lma give an equally good fit to the data .",
    "we find that the best ",
    "fit points for the combined analysis are @xmath1 ev@xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath4 d.  o.  f. and @xmath18 ev@xmath2 and @xmath6 with @xmath7 d.  o.  f. we note that in contrast with the earlier 504-day study of ref .  @xcite our results indicate that the lma solution is not only allowed , but actually slightly preferred .",
    "the existence of hints that the lma msw solution could be correct was also discussed in ref.@xcite . on the other hand",
    "we find good quantitative agreement with the recent results of @xcite as well as qualitative agreement with the old results of  @xcite based on a smaller sample .",
    "we show that seasonal effects may be no - negligible in the lower part of the lma region , without conflict with the negative hints of a day - night variation .",
    "in particular the best - fit lma solution predicts a seasonal effect of 8.5% , 6% of which is due to the eccentricity of the earth s orbit . for conversions into sterile neutrinos",
    "we find that only the sma solution is possible with best  fit point @xmath19 ev@xmath2 and @xmath20 and @xmath10 d.  o.  f. we also consider departures of the standard solar model ( ssm ) of bahcall and pinsonneault 1998 ( bp98 ) by allowing arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath12 fluxes .",
    "these modifications do not affect significantly the oscillation parameters .",
    "we find that the best fit is obtained for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the sma solution both for conversions into active or sterile neutrinos and @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the lma solution .",
    "in order to study the possible values of neutrino masses and mixing for the msw solution to the solar neutrino problem , we have used data on the total event rates measured at the chlorine experiment in homestake @xcite , at the two gallium experiments gallex and sage @xcite and at the water cerenkov detector super  kamiokande . apart from total event rates we have in this case the zenith angle distribution of the events ,",

    "@xcite they have used the sle method and they present results for two additional bins with energies between 5.5 mev and 6.5 mev .    in our study",
    "we use the experimental results from the super  kamiokande collaboration on the recoil electron spectrum on the 18 energy bins including the results from the le analysis for the 16 bins above 6.5 mev and the results from the sle analysis for the two low energy bins below 6.5 mev , shown in table  [ spectrum ] .",
    "notice that in table  [ spectrum ] we have symmetrized the errors to be included in our @xmath51 analysis .",
    "we have explicitly checked that the exclusion region is very insensitive to this symmetrization .",
    "we define @xmath51 for the spectrum as @xmath78 where @xmath79 again , we introduce a normalization factor @xmath80 in order to avoid double - counting with the data on the total event rate which is already included in @xmath73 . notice that in our definition of @xmath81 we introduce the correlations amongst the different systematic errors in the form of a non - diagonal error matrix in analogy to our previous analysis of the total rates .",

    "@xcite the expected msw event rates do exhibit a seasonal effect . in the lma region",
    "such dependence can be expected mainly due to the different night duration throughout the year at the experimental site and also due to the different averaged earth densities crossed by the neutrino during the night periods , which lead to a seasonal - dependent @xmath0 regeneration effect in the earth . on the other hand , in the sma region ,",
    "earth matter effects are due to resonant conversion of neutrinos in the earth which is only possible when neutrinos travel both through the mantle and the core  @xcite .",
    "thus we find that in the sma region the seasonal variation is associated with the fact that at super ",

    "unlike active neutrinos which lead to events in the super  kamiokande detector by interacting via neutral current with the electrons , sterile neutrinos do not contribute to the super  kamiokande event rates .",
    "therefore a larger survival probability for @xmath11 neutrinos is needed to accommodate the measured rate . as a consequence a larger contribution from @xmath11 neutrinos to the chlorine and gallium experiments is expected , so that the small measured rate in chlorine can only be accommodated if no @xmath113 neutrinos are present in the flux .",

    "when doing so we find that the no - oscillation hypothesis gives @xmath51 = 17.4 for 15 d.  o.  f. for @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "when combining the information from both total rates and the recoil energy spectrum data in the case of active - active neutrino oscillations we obtain that for the lma : @xmath142 for 16 d.  o.  f. which is acceptable at  66% while for the sma solution @xmath143 which is acceptable at  75% cl .",
    "finally for the low solution we find @xmath144 acceptable at  93% .    in the case of active - sterile neutrino oscillations the best ",
    "fit point is obtained for the sma solution : @xmath145 which is acceptable at  89% cl .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : specnorm ] we display the normalized expected energy spectra for sma , lma solutions for active - active oscillations and for no - oscillation with non - standard @xmath11 and @xmath12 fluxes .",
    "recently super  kamiokande has also presented preliminary results which seem to hint for a seasonal variation of the event rates , especially for recoil electron energy above 11.5 mev .",
    "as explained in sec .",
    "[ data : sea ] the expected msw event rates do exhibit a seasonal effect due to the the seasonal - dependent @xmath0 regeneration effect in the earth .",
    "we explore here the constraints on the msw oscillation parameters which can be extracted from the seasonal dependence data given in table  [ seasonal ] .    considering only the seasonal variation data above 11.5 mev ( allowing a free normalization for the @xmath11 flux ) we find that the the ssm yields a value of @xmath146 for 7 d.  o.  f. this shows that the data is still not precise enough to enable one to draw any definitive conclusion .",
    "however one can still obtain some preliminary information on the msw parameters from the analysis of these data . in this way , when allowing oscillations into active flavours we obtain the best ",
    "fit point for @xmath147  ev@xmath2 and @xmath148 with @xmath149 for 5 d.  o.  f. and in the case of active - sterile neutrino oscillations best fit is obtained for @xmath150  ev@xmath2 and @xmath151 with @xmath152 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : season ] we show the exclusion regions at 95% and 99% cl .",
    "the larger area represents the _ allowed _ region at 95% cl .",
    "being an allowed region , it means that at 95% cl , some effect is observed .",
    "the darker area shows the small excluded region at 99% cl .",
    "since the seasonal variation of the event rates in the msw region is due to neutrino regeneration in the earth one expects a correlation with the day - night variation which arises from the same origin .",
    "this correlation is observed as the 95% allowed regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : season ] have a large overlap with the 99% excluded region from the observed zenith angle dependence in fig .  [",
    "fig : ratesdn ] .",
    "notice however that the upper part of the 95% cl allowed region for the oscillation in active flavours ( larger @xmath101 and larger mixing angles ) is still in agreement with the observed zenith angle dependence .",
    "thus , should the seasonal effect be confirmed in the higher energy part of the spectrum , it will favour the lma solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "we now present our results for the simultaneous fits to all the available data and observables . in the combination",
    "we define the global @xmath51 as the sum of the different @xmath51 defined above . in principle such analysis should be taken with a grain of salt as these pieces of information are not fully independent ; in fact , they are just different projections of the double differential spectrum of events as a function of time and energy .",
    "thus in our combination we are neglecting possible correlations between the uncertainties in the energy and time dependence of the event rates .    from the full data sample",
    "we obtain that the for the ssm of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath153 for 32 d.  o.  f. so the probability of explaining the full data sample as a statistical fluctuation of the the ssm together with the sm of particle interactions is smaller than @xmath154 .    in the msw oscillation region",
    "we obtain that for oscillations into active flavours the best fits are obtained for the lma solution with @xmath155 for 30 d.  o.  f. which implies that the solution is acceptable at 77% cl . , while in the sma region the local best  fit point is @xmath156 valid at the 83% cl .. the global analysis still presents a minimum in the low region with best  fit point : @xmath157 which is acceptable at 90% cl .",
    "the results of the global analysis for the case of of active - sterile neutrino oscillations , show the fit is slightly worse in this case than in the active - active oscillation scenario .",
    "fit point is obtained for the sma solution with @xmath158 acceptable at 90% cl .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratesdnss ] we show the 90% ( lighter ) and 99% ( darker ) cl allowed regions in the plane @xmath101-@xmath159 .",
    "best  fit points in each regions are also indicated .    by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : ratesdnss ] and  [ fig : rates ] we see the effect of the inclusion of the full data from super - kamiokande on both time and energy dependence of the event rates . for oscillations into active neutrinos ,",
    "the larger modification is in the lma solution region which has its lower part cut by the day - night variation data while the upper part is suppressed by the data on the recoiled energy spectrum .",
    "the best fit point is also shifted towards a larger mass difference by a more than a factor 2 .",
    "as for the sma solution region the position of the best fit point is shifted towards a slightly smaller mixing angle , while the size of the region at the 90% cl is reduced . at 99% cl the allowed sma region is very little modified . for oscillations into sterile neutrinos the best fit point is also shifted towards a smaller mixing angle .",
    "we finally study the allowed parameter space with the normalization of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 fluxes are left free .",
    "figure [ fig : ratesdnssbo ] shows the allowed regions in the msw parameter space when the normalizations are allowed to take arbitrary values .",
    "the best fit for the lma solution occurs at @xmath160 which is acceptable at 64% cl .",
    "the best fit sma solution is obtained for @xmath161 which is acceptable at 80% cl . , the best fit for",
    "the low solution occurs at @xmath162 which is acceptable at 90% cl . ,",
    "in the case of active - sterile neutrino oscillations @xmath163 which is acceptable at 85% cl .",
    ",    for all solutions we find that the main effect of considering free normalization of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 fluxes is upon the position of the best - fit points , mainly a reduction in the value of the mixing angle .",
    "the allowed regions are also enlarged as can be seen by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : ratesdnss ] and [ fig : ratesdnssbo ] .",
    "we have presented an updated global analysis of two - flavor msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem using the full data set corresponding to the 825-day super  kamiokande sample plus chlorine , gallex and sage experiments .",
    "in addition to all measured total event rates we included all super  kamiokande data on the zenith angle dependence , energy spectrum and seasonal variation of the events .",
    "we have given a comparison of the quality of different solutions of the solar neutrino anomaly in terms of msw conversions of @xmath0 into active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "for the case of conversions into active neutrinos we have found that once the full data set is included both sma and lma solutions give an equally good fit to the data .",
    "we find that the best ",
    "fit points for the combined analysis are @xmath164 ev@xmath2 and @xmath165 with @xmath4 d.  o.  f and @xmath166 ev@xmath2 and @xmath167 with @xmath7 d.  o.  f. in contrast with the earlier 504-day study of bahcall - krastev - smirnov our results indicate that the lma solution is slightly preferred . although small , there is a hint for seasonality in the data and this should therefore take into account in future studies , as we have indicated here .",
    "defining the seasonal variation ( in percent ) as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the expected event rate during the winter ( summer ) period , we find that the seasonal effect may still reach 11% in the lower part of the allowed lma region ( 6% comes from the variation expected from the geometric effect due to the eccentricity of the earth s orbit ) , without conflict with the negative hints of a day - night variation .",
    "such seasonal dependence is correlated with the day - night effect and this in turn can be used in order to discriminate the msw from the vacuum oscillation solution to the solar neutrino anomaly .",
    "we have performed a numerical study of this correlation @xcite which generalizes the estimate presented by smirnov at the 1999 edition of moriond for a constant earth density .",
    "our results show that due to the earth matter profile the seasonal variation can be substantially enhanced or suppressed as compared to the expected value obtained with an average earth density .",
    "one must notice , however , that the exact values of masses and mixing for which a significant enhancement is possible may depend on the precise model of the earth density profile .",
    "the numerical results presented above were obtained using the step function profile and thus numerical differences with the results obtained with , for instance the prem model @xcite can be expected for a given point in the msw plane .    with the results from the combined analysis one can also predict the expected event rates at future experiments .",
    "for example , we find that the average oscillation probabilities for @xmath170 neutrinos in the different allowed regions for msw oscillations into active neutrinos is @xmath171 @xmath172 these results imply that , at borexino we expect a suppression on the number of events as compared with the predictions of the ssm of @xmath173 @xmath174 for conversions into sterile neutrinos only the sma solution is possible with best  fit point @xmath8 ev@xmath2 and @xmath175 and @xmath10 d.  o.  f which leads to @xmath176 and one expects a larger suppression of events at borexino @xmath177    as a way to improve the description of the observed recoil electron energy spectrum we have also considered the effect of departing from the ssm of bahcall and pinsonneault 1998 by allowing arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath12 fluxes .",
    "our results show that this additional freedom does not lead to a significant modification of the oscillation parameters .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the sma solution both for conversions into active or sterile neutrinos and @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the lma solution .",
