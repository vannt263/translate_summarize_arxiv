    "for heavy ions , the all - order approach is the only alternative as the parameter of @xmath1 is of order of unity . for light systems , this method is complementary to the @xmath1-expansion approach and can provide results for the high - order remainder beyond the known @xmath1-expansion terms .",

    "[ fig : sese ] was a long and difficult project accomplished in a series of papers @xcite .",

    "a reliable determination of this contribution from the all - order results requires a high numerical accuracy to be achieved for the low values of @xmath4 , which is a challenging task . in our recent investigation @xcite",

    ", one needs an efficient procedure for calculating the transforms for various momenta , including ones as large as @xmath190 . in our calculations",
    ", we used the gauss - legendre integration quadratures in the region where the argument of the bessel function is of about unity or smaller . outside this region ,",
    "the spherical bessel function was expressed as a combination of the sine and cosine functions .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the sine and cosine transform was performed with help of routines of the nag fortran library .",
    "the scheme described above works well for the @xmath170 contribution but turns out to be not sufficiently effective for @xmath171 , leading to a slow convergence of the radial integrations with respect to the number of integration points .",
    "this is because the free green function @xmath191 contains a bessel function [ see eq .  ( [ fgr3 ] ) ] , which oscillates rapidly in the high - momenta region .",
    "this problem was solved by observing that the integral over @xmath174 in eq .",
    "( [ pb ] ) has a structure similar to @xmath192 , i.e. , it is essentially a bessel transform over the intervals @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",

    "the evaluation of the two remaining nested contributions , @xmath195 and @xmath196 , was performed in the full analogy with the discussed above .",
    "however , it turned out to be much more time consuming due to a larger number of integrations . indeed , in place of an integration over @xmath172 in @xmath197 and @xmath171 , there are now four integrations ( those over @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 and the feynman - parameter integration implicitly present in the vertex operator ) .",

    "the two integrations over @xmath143 and @xmath144 , however , lead to a considerable increase of the computational expense ( this being about a week of the processor time for each value of @xmath4 ) .    for the overlapping contribution @xmath198 , there are seven integrations to be performed numerically .",
    "five of them are explicitly written in eq .",
    "( [ pe3 ] ) , one over the feynman parameter is implicitly present in the vertex operator , and the last one is the bessel transform integral in the green function .",
    "the number of nested integrations can be reduced by observing that the integrations over @xmath144 and over the feynman parameter can be carried out independently of the integration over @xmath199 .",
    "the calculation is complicated by the fact that the integral over @xmath199 contains a bessel function , thus being essentially a bessel transform . in order to get a stable result for the @xmath199 integration in the region of large values of @xmath200",

    "however , the resulting formulas turn out to be rather lengthy and not very convenient for numerical evaluation as they become numerically unstable for @xmath290 . because of this , we prefer to evaluate eqs .",
