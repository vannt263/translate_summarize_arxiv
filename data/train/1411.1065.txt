    "star formation is one of the main internal driving forces of galaxy evolution , resulting in the chemical enrichment of a galaxy , the heating of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and indirectly , the production of dust through the winds of dying stars . star formation converts a galaxy s molecular gas into stars through multiple complicated processes including gas accretion and the collapse and cooling of molecular clouds .",
    "although the star formation process itself is intricate , the overall conversion of gas into stars can be expressed simply by the schmidt - kennicutt ( sk ) law which directly relates the molecular gas content to the star formation rate ( sfr ) through a power - law equation , @xmath8 , albeit with significant scatter @xcite .",
    "the bulk of the present day stellar mass was formed at a peak epoch of star formation , from @xmath9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "during this era , the buildup of stellar mass was dominated by dusty galaxies referred to as luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath10 ) and ultra luminous infrared galaxies",
    "( ulirgs , @xmath11 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the past two decades , the spate of far - ir / submillimeter space - based and ground - based telescopes have enabled astronomers to simultaneously study the star formation , through infrared ( ir ) emission , and molecular gas , through co emission , of dusty galaxies out to redshifts of @xmath12 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the ir luminosity , @xmath1 , is an ideal measure of the sfr for dusty galaxies as it is the integrated emission from the dust , presumably heated by star formation . on galaxy - wide scales",
    ", co traces the molecular hydrogen which is difficult to observe directly ; a conversion factor , @xmath13 , is used to relate the co luminosity directly to the h@xmath0 mass ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in the past few years",
    ", a `` galaxy main sequence '' has been empirically determined for local and high redshift galaxies ; a tight relationship holds between sfr and stellar mass , and this relationship evolves with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies that lie above the main sequence , that is , galaxies that have an enhanced sfr for a given stellar mass , are designated `` starbursts '' in this parameter space , as they are thought to be undergoing a short - lived burst of star formation , likely triggered by a major merger . the rate at which a galaxy can form stars is limited by the amount of molecular gas present . @xcite proposed an extended sk law which relates the specific star formation rate ( @xmath14 ) to the stellar mass surface density , suggesting that the existing stellar population may play a role in regulating the amount of star formation .",
    "the authors apply their extended sk law to an analytical model of gas accretion and find that it accurately reproduces the galaxy main sequence .    a dichotomy between starbursts and normal star forming galaxies",
    "may also be observed by comparing @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "first , there may be a `` normal '' rate of star formation measured in undisturbed disk galaxies for a given amount of molecular gas .",
    "then , there is an enhanced starburst mode , where a galaxy has a higher @xmath1 than expected for a given @xmath2 , possibly triggered by a major merger funneling gas towards the inner regions of a galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this dichotomy has a direct effect on the calculation of the h@xmath0 mass , since @xmath13 is proposed to be a factor of @xmath15 lower for starbursting galaxies , due to significant amounts of co residing in the inter - cloud medium .",
    "correctly identifying starbursts is critical for calculating accurate gas masses .",
    "it now appears that every massive galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole at the center , implying that all galaxies have gone through an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) phase , and some lirgs and ulirgs show signs of concurrent black hole growth and star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a starburst is triggered by a major merger , and this phase can be followed by an agn phase , implying that an obscured growing agn may be observable during a galaxy s starburst phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if present , an agn can dramatically influence the internal evolution of a galaxy by heating the dust , expelling the gas , and ultimately quenching the star formation through feedback mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of an obscured agn on the ism can be probed through ir observations . in the mid - ir ,",
    "star forming galaxies have prominent pah features arising from photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) , but agn emission can dilute these features , leaving a warm dust power - law continuum @xcite .",
    "radiation from the agn can heat the dust in the ism to temperatures @xmath16k , producing a significant contribution ( @xmath17 ) to the far - ir emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the degree of scatter in the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , often attributed to the two different modes of star formation , is possibly affected by the contribution from an agn to @xmath1 .",

    "m ) instead of @xmath1 ( 8 - 1000@xmath20 m ) , as dust emission in this regime should come primarily from heating by young stars .",

    "our sample lies in the range expected .",
    "this suggests that we are not observing any differences between our starburst and main sequence galaxies in figures [ fig : lir_lco ] and [ fig : sfe ] simply because we are not probing a large enough range of @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",

    "that is , weaker pah emission is associated with a higher star formation efficiency and faster gas depletion timescales .",
    "the decrease in @xmath92 with increasing @xmath1 could indicate that pah emission in general is suppressed for more luminous galaxies .",
    "we do not find significantly lower @xmath120 ratios for our agn or composite galaxies as compared to our star forming galaxies , indicating that in our sample , the growing agn is not affecting this ratio .",

    "second , we use @xmath125 to calculate the gas mass for those galaxies with an ssfr indicative of a starburst ( bottom panel of figure [ fig : gas ] ) .",
    "we plot the gas fractions as a function of redshift we also plot gas fractions of normal star forming galaxies from the literature , and we have corrected the individual @xmath13 values used to be 4.6 .",
    "the average molecular gas fraction evolves with redshift , and we plot the measured relation , @xmath128 , determined from a stellar mass limited sample with @xmath129 @xcite , similar to the masses of our 5muses sample .",
    "our gas fractions ( in both panels ) lie in the range expected when comparing with the best fit line and the points from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our co(1 - 0 ) detection rate is high ( 17 out of 24 sources ) , producing a large range of measured gas fractions . in the top panel ,",
    "our starburst galaxies are systematically higher than the main sequence galaxies , and the scatter about the @xmath130 line is larger , which suggests that the lower @xmath125 conversion factor might be more appropriate for these sources if we expect similar gas fractions for main sequence and starburst galaxies .",
    "theoretically , the conversion factor depends on the geometry of the co and h@xmath0 distribution .",
    "when the co emission is extended and not confined to molecular clouds , warm , and has a high surface density , as is the case in mergers , then the lower @xmath13 value is appropriate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite measure @xmath13 for a sample of high redshift main sequence and starburst galaxies and find an anti - correlation between @xmath13 and ssfr , which they interpret as evidence that the mechanisms responsible for raising a galaxy off the main sequence must also affect the physical conditions within the star forming regions .",
    "we also find that the gas fractions reproduce a similar separation between sources as the main sequence criterion , linking @xmath13 with the ssfr .",
    "in contrast , neither @xmath5 nor @xmath120 shows any separation between the starburst and main sequence galaxies , likely due to the limited range being probed .",
    "these ratios , then , are relatively stable for galaxies of a limited mass and luminosity range .",

    "we currently lack metallicities for our sample , so we can not directly apply the prescribed variable conversion factor .",
    "given the continuous relationship between ssfr and sfr/@xmath2 evidenced in figure [ fig : tdep ] , a continuous , rather than bimodal , conversion factor based on galactic environment may be the most appropriate choice and would mean that all galaxies in our sample obey a similar relationship between the molecular gas and the stellar mass .",
