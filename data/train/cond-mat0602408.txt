    "over the last decades , the measurement of noise has become a widely accepted diagnosis in the study of electronic quantum transport@xcite .",
    "indeed , noise provides information on the charge of the carriers in unconventional conductors , when considering the fano factor  the ratio of the noise to the average current  in the regime where the carriers tunnel independently .",
    "away from this poissonian regime , noise also contains crucial information on the statistics of the charge carriers @xcite .",
    "experimentally , low frequency noise in the khz ",
    "mhz range is more accessible than high frequency ( ghz  thz ) noise : it can in principle be measured using state of the art time acquisition techniques . for higher frequency measurements , it is becoming necessary to build a noise detector on chip for a specific range of high frequencies . in this work",
    "we consider a detector circuit which is capacitively coupled to the mesoscopic device .",
    "this circuit is composed of a normal metal  superconductor junction ( ns junction ) .",
    "transport in this circuit occurs when the electrons tunneling between the normal metal and the superconductor are either tunneling elastically , or when they are able to gain or to loose energy via photo - assisted andreev reflections .",
    "the `` photon '' is provided or absorbed from the mesoscopic circuit which is capacitively coupled to the ns detector .",
    "the measurement of a dc current in the detector can thus provide information on the absorption and on the emission component of the current noise correlator .",
    "several theoretical efforts have been made to describe the high frequency noise measurement process @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in specific transport setups , high frequency noise detection is required in order to fully characterize transport .",
    "examples are bell inequality tests @xcite and the detection of the anomalous charges in one dimensional correlated systems@xcite .",
    "the former require information about high frequency noise in order to establish a correspondence between electron number correlators and current noise correlators .",
    "the latter requires a high frequency noise measurement in order to obtain a non - zero signal when the nanotube is connected to fermi liquid leads , which tend to wash out the features of a one dimensional correlated electron system .    in ref .",
    ", a detection circuit , which was capacitively coupled to the mesoscopic circuit to be measured , was proposed as a high frequency noise detector .",
    "this interesting theoretical idea has so far eluded experimental verification , possibly because in the double dot system , additional ( unwanted ) sources of inelastic scattering render a precise noise measurement quite difficult .",
    "it is therefore necessary to look for detection circuits which are less vulnerable to dissipation , as is the case of superconducting circuits , because of the presence of the superconducting gap .",
    "indeed , the basic idea of ref . was implemented experimentally recently@xcite using a superconductor  insulator  superconductor ( sis ) junction as a detector , measuring in this case the finite frequency noise characteristics of a josephson junction .",
    "more recently , the noise of a carbon nanotube / quantum dot was also measured @xcite using capacitive coupling to an sis detector , with the detection of super - poissonian noise resulting from inelastic cotunneling processes . the latter proposals , together with their successful experimental implementations , indicate that superconducting detector circuits have advantages over normal detection circuits because of the presence of the superconducting gap .",
    "the purpose of the present work is thus to analyze a similar situation , except that the sis junction is replaced by an ns circuit which transfers two electrons using andreev reflection between a normal lead and a superconductor .",
    "the present scheme is similar in spirit to the initial proposal of ref .",
    ", in the sense that it exploits dynamical coulomb blockade physics @xcite .",
    "however , here two electrons need to be transferred from / to the superconductor , and such transitions involve high lying virtual states which are less prone to dissipation because of the superconducting gap , similarly to the sis detector of refs . .",
    "andreev reflection@xcite typically assumes a good contact between a normal metal and a superconductor , but in general it can be applied to tunneling contacts  it then involves tunneling transitions via virtual states .",
    "consequently , depending on the applied dc bias , two successive `` inelastic '' electron jumps are required for a current to pass through the measurement circuit .",
    "the amplitude of the dc current as a function of bias voltage in the measurement circuit provides an effective readout of the noise power to be measured .",
    "the detector circuit is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figns ] .",
    "two capacitors are placed , respectively , between each side of the mesoscopic device and each side of the ns tunnel junction .",
    "this means that a current fluctuation in the mesoscopic device generates , via the capacitors , a voltage fluctuation across the ns junction . in turn , the voltage fluctuations translate into fluctuations of the phase around the junction .",
    "the presence of the neighboring mesoscopic circuit acts as a specific electromagnetic environment for this tunnel junction , which is described in the context of dynamical coulomb blockade@xcite for this reason .",
    "[ ns_ener ] depicts several scenarios for transport through an ns interface .",
    "elastic transfer of single electrons can occur if the voltage applied to the junction is larger than the gap ( fig . [",
    "ns_ener]a ) . below the gap , elastic transport can only occur via andreev reflection @xcite , effectively transferring two electrons with opposite energies with respect to the superconductor chemical potential ( fig . [ ns_ener]b ) .",
    "single electron can be transferred with an initial energy below the gap , provided that a `` photon '' is provided from the environment in order to create a quasiparticle in the superconductor ( fig . [ ns_ener]c ) .",
    "similarly , andreev reflection can be rendered inelastic by the environment : for instance , two electrons on the normal side , with total energy above the superconductor chemical potential , can give away a `` photon '' to the environment , so that they can be absorbed as a cooper pair in the superconductor ( fig .",
    "[ ns_ener]d ) .",
    "as we shall see , such inelastic andreev processes are particularly useful for noise detection .",
    "after studying the noise detection of the single ns junction , we will turn later on to a double junction consisting of a normal metal lead , a quantum dot operating in the coulomb blockade regime , and a superconductor connected to the latter ( fig .",
    "[ fignds ] ) . the charging energy of the dot",
    "is assumed to be large enough that double occupancy is prohibited .",
    "this setup has the advantage on the previous proposal that additional energy filtering is provided by the quantum dot .",
    "below , we refer to this system as the normal metal  dot  superconductor ( nds ) detector circuit .        in fig .",
    "[ nds_ener ] , the quantum dot level is located above the superconductor chemical potential , and placed well within the gap in order to avoid quasiparticle processes . because double occupancy is prohibited by the coulomb blockade , andreev transport occurs via sequential tunneling of the two electrons . yet , because of energy conservation , the same energy requirements as in fig .",
    "[ ns_ener]b have to be satisfied for the final states ( electrons with opposite energies , see fig . [ nds_ener]a ) . in t - matrix terminology , for this transition to occur , virtual states corresponding to the energy of the dot are required , which suppress the andreev tunneling current because of large energy denominators in the transition rate . figs .",
    "[ nds_ener ] b , c , d , describe the cases where an environment is coupled to the same nds circuit .",
    "provided that this environment can yield or give some of its energy to the nds detector , electronic transitions via the dot can become much more likely because electron energies on the normal side can be close to that of the dot level .",
    "such transitions can thus occur even if the chemical potential of the normal lead exceeds that of the superconductor . as we shall see later on , the bias voltage can act as a valve for photo - assisted electron transitions .",
    "it is precisely these latter situations which will be exploited in order to measure the noise of the measuring circuit ( the `` environment '' ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model and the calculation of the photo - assisted current in the ns junction are given in sec .",
    "ii , and results for the detection of the noise of a quantum point contact are presented . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform the same analysis for the nds junction and compare the results .",
    "the conclusion is point out in sec .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes the decoupled normal metal lead  superconductor  environment ( mesoscopic circuit ) system reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the energy states in the lead , with @xmath2 an electron creation operator .",
    "the superconductor hamiltonian has the diagonal form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are quasiparticle operators , which relate to the fermi operators @xmath5 by the bogoliubov transformation @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the quasiparticle energy , @xmath8 is the normal state single - electron energy counted from the fermi level @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the superconducting gap which will be assumed to be the largest energy scale in these calculations .",
    "hereafter , we also define @xmath11 and assume @xmath12 .    here",
    "we do not specify the hamiltonian of the environment because the environment represents an open system : the mesoscopic circuit which represents the environment will only manifest itself via the phase fluctuations @xmath13 which are induced at the ns junction ( or later on for the nds circuit , at the dot  superconductor junction ) because of the location of the capacitor plates . in what follows , we shall assume that the unsymmetrized noise spectral density @xmath14 corresponding to photon emission ( for positive frequency ) , or alternatively @xmath15 , the spectral density of noise corresponding to photon absorption , are both specified by the transport properties of the mesoscopic circuit@xcite",
    ". here @xmath16 stands for an irreducible noise correlator , where the product of average currents has been subtracted out .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian describing the electron transferring between the superconductor and normal metal lead in the ns junction is @xmath17 the indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 refer to the normal metal lead , superconductor .",
    "we consider for simplicity that @xmath20 .",
    "note that the tunneling hamiltonian contains a fluctuating phase factor , which represents the coupling to the mesoscopic circuit .",
    "indeed , because of the capacitive coupling between the sides of the ns junction and the mesoscopic circuit , a current fluctuation translates into a voltage fluctuation across the ns junction .",
    "both are related via the trans - impedance of the circuit @xcite @xmath21 .",
    "next , the voltage fluctuations translate into phase fluctuations across the junction , as the phase is the canonical conjugate of the charge at the junctions@xcite : the phase is thus considered as a quantum mechanical operator throughout this paper . for definition purposes ,",

    "the present system bears similarities with the study of inelastic andreev reflection in the case where the superconductor contains phase fluctuations@xcite .",
    "such phase fluctuations destroy the symmetry between electrons and holes , and affect the current voltage characteristics of the ns junction .",
    "the tunneling current associated with two electrons is given by the fermi golden rule @xmath27 , with the tunneling rate@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the tunneling energies of the inital and final states , including the environment , @xmath31 is the transition operator , which is expressed as @xmath32 with @xmath33 is a positive infinitesimal .    throughout this paper ,",
    "one considers the photo - assisted tunneling ( pat ) current due to the high frequency current fluctuations of the mesoscopic device , as the difference @xcite : @xmath34 where , in general , the total current for tunneling of electrons through the junction is @xmath35 .",
    "however , experimentally@xcite it is difficult to couple capacitively and then to remove the mesoscopic device circuit from the detector circuit .",
    "what is in fact often measured is the excess noise , i.e. the difference between current fluctuations at a given bias and zero bias in the mesoscopic circuit . in the latter on",
    ", we will calculate the excess noise @xmath36 of @xmath37 . in this work ,",
    "we thus measure the difference between the currents through the detector when the device circuit is applied a bias voltage and zero bias , as a function of detector bias voltage , which is defined as @xmath38 this also corresponds to the difference between the pat currents through the detector when the device circuit is applied a bias voltage and zero bias @xmath39 because the contributions with no environment cancel out .",
    "the difference pat current thus provides crucial information on the spectral density of excess noise of the mesoscopic device .",
    "notice that our calculation applies to the zero temperature case for convenience , but it can be generalized to finite temperatures .",
    "although our focus of interest concerns photo - assisted andreev reflection , we need to compute all possible contributions .",
    "the current associated with one electron tunneling is given by the fermi golden rule : @xmath40    the calculation of the current proceeds in the same way as that of a normal metal junction @xcite , except that one has to take into account the superconducting density of states on the right side of the junction which is done by exploiting the bogoliubov transformation .",

    "nevertheless , due to the presence of the environment , electrons can absorb / emit energy from / to the environment so that an inelastic quasiparticle current flows .",
    "@xmath58      the single electron ( quasiparticle ) tunneling current is of first order in the tunneling amplitude .",

    "we find that both current contributions have the same form and the current fluctuations of the mesoscopic device affect the current in the detector at the energy corresponding to the total energy of two electrons in the normal lead .",

    "as pointed out above , we are computing the difference of the pat currents in the presence and in the absence of the dc bias .",
    "this means that we insert the spectral density of excess noise of the mesoscopic device , which for a point contact bears most of its weight near zero frequencies .",
    "excess noise decreases linearly to zero over a range @xmath108 $ ] for positive and negative frequencies : @xmath109          we choose a generic form for the transimpedance , similar in spirit to that chosen in ref . .",

    ", choosing a finite cutoff frequency @xmath114 means that at frequencies @xmath115 , the mesoscopic circuit has no influence on the detector circuit because low frequencies do not propagate through a capacitor .",
    "we calculate numerically the pat currents in the three above cases : single and two quasiparticle tunneling , and andreev reflection .",

    "currents are typically plotted as a function of the dc bias voltage @xmath87 of the detector , for several values of the mesoscopic bias voltage @xmath118 ( the `` environment '' ) .",
    "our motivation is to consider the pat currents with the condition @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , where the effect of the environment on the pat current is most pronounced , and we shall predict that two electrons tunneling as a cooper pair ( andreev processes ) contributes the most to the pat current , except close to @xmath121 . because of the symmetry between negative @xmath87 and positive @xmath87 , we display the results for @xmath122 .",
    "the pat currents for the three above processes are plotted next to one other in fig .",
    "[ fignst1 ] for comparison .",
    "we find in fig .",
    "[ fignst1 ] that if the chemical potential of the normal metal lead is close to the potential of the superconductor lead ( @xmath123 ) , the pat currents in the three cases are suppressed .",
    "for the two cases of quasiparticle tunneling , the pat currents are equal to zero below a certain threshold .",
    "the single quasiparticle current differs from zero at a threshold which is identified as @xmath124 , that is quasiparticles are able to tunnel above that superconductor gap only if they can borrow the necessary energy from the mesoscopic device .",
    "this explains why the curves associated with different values of the mesoscopic device bias voltage are shifted to the right as @xmath118 decreases . for two quasiparticle particle tunneling",
    ", we observe that the pat current has a similar threshold , which , compared to fig .",
    "[ fignst1]a , is pushed toward the right in fig .",

    "surprisingly , the curves corresponding are once again shifted to the right with decreasing @xmath118 .",
    "these curves all have a sharp maximum at @xmath121 .",
    "we turn now to the andreev pat difference current , which dominates the two above processes at small and moderate bias .",
    "note that the total andreev current contains an elastic contribution as well as an inelastic contribution below the gap , contrary to quasiparticle tunneling which have contributions below the gap only because these processes are photo - assisted . because we are computing the difference between pat current with and without the mesoscopic bias voltage",

    "( [ pat_cooper ] ) tells us that the presence of the environment also gives rise to an effective elastic contribution to the pat andreev difference current .",
    "unfortunately , this elastic correction is not small compared to the true andreev current .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fignst1 ] , we note that the pat curve for andreev processes is shifted to the left when the bias of the mesoscopic device is increased . the environment provides / absorbs energy to pairs of electrons whose energies are not symmetrical with respect to the superconducting chemical potential . at very weak @xmath87 ,",
    "the elastic correction is small compared to the true andreev current .",

    "there is a balance between the right and left currents at very weak bias",
    ".    as the bias is increased , electrons pairs whose energies are above this chemical potential will now be able to yield a photon to the environment , giving rise to an increase of the inelastic pat current .",
    "also , the reverse andreev process mentioned above becomes more restricted because the available empty states for electrons in the leads lie higher at positive bias .",
    "the elastic pat current ( not shown in the figures ) increases when we increase the detector bias but it is always smaller than the inelastic contribution .",
    "the total pat current increases gradually ( fig .",

    "there is in fact no threshold for the pat andreev current : for small bias , it has a linear behavior ( fig .",

    "the elastic and inelastic contributions have now a tendency to cancel each other .",
    "the current reaches a maximum close to the gap , and then it decreases dramatically at the gap .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that for positive bias , the initial state for two quasiparticle tunnel processes and for andreev reflection is precisely the same : close to the gap two quasiparticle tunneling takes over the andreev process .",

    "turning now to the inelastic current , we consider the contribution of 2 electrons being transfered inelastically from the normal metal lead to the superconductor , which is called the @xmath199 in fig .",
    "[ fig_contribution ] . when @xmath181 , electrons tunnel through the quantum dot to the superconductor by absorbing or emitting energy to environment . however , as in the elastic case , the transfer from the normal metal to the dot is more favorable when @xmath200 , which explains the presence of the step in @xmath199 at this bias voltage .",
    "next , we consider the contribution of two electrons tunneling from the superconductor to the normal metal lead , which is called @xmath201 in fig .",
    "[ fig_contribution ] . when @xmath87 is positive , @xmath201 is nonzero only when @xmath202 , this case corresponds to the process of the cooper pair absorbing energy from environment to tunnel to the normal metal lead .",
    "if @xmath203 , a small step occurs ( not shown ) at @xmath190 corresponding to the activation of the two cooper pair electrons on the dot : this small feature can only be seen by zooming in the picture . when @xmath87 is negative , the absorption of energy from the environment becomes much more favorable . because of this , the analog of the step corresponding to @xmath191 in the elastic current is smoothed out , and it saturates around @xmath191",
    ". nevertheless , @xmath201 also contains contributions where electrons emit energy to the environment . starting from @xmath165 , the process of the cooper pair tunneling to the normal metal lead and emitting energy to environment has first a small contribution to @xmath201 but it really becomes noticeable below @xmath191 and eventually saturates for lower bias voltage ( not shown ) . as the voltage of the mesoscopic device is lowered ( left to right panels of fig .",

    "in brief the sum of the contributions for emission and absorption in @xmath201 have a tendency to compensate the elastic current at voltages where saturation is reached .",
    "> from the above considerations , we therefore can interpret the curve of @xmath54 , and we understand when the detector circuit absorbs or emits energy from / to mesoscopic device : when @xmath87 is negative , the pat current is mainly due to absorption for @xmath177 , and emission for @xmath204",

    "it is also acceptable with present day detection techniques .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a new capacitive coupling scheme to study the high frequency spectral density of noise of a mesoscopic device . as in the initial proposal of ref .",
    ", the effect of the noise originating from a mesoscopic device triggers an inelastic dc current in the detector circuit .",
    "this inelastic contribution can be thought as a dynamical coulomb blockade effect where the phase fluctuations at a specific junction in the detector circuit junction are related to voltage fluctuations in same junction . in turn ,",
    "such voltage fluctuations originate from the current fluctuations in the nearby mesoscopic device , and both are related by a trans - impedance .",
    "the novelty is that here , because the junction contains a superconducting element , in the subgap regime , two electrons need to be transferred as the elementary charge tunneling process . in a conventional elastic tunneling situation ,",
    "the two electrons injected from ( ejected in ) the normal metal lead need to have exactly opposite energies in order to combine as a cooper pair in the superconductor . here",
    ", this energy conservation can be violated in a controlled manner because a photon originating from the mesoscopic circuit can be provided to / from the constituent electrons of the cooper pair in the tunneling process .",
    "we have computed the dc current in the detector circuit for two different situations . in a first step ,",
    "we considered a single ns junction , and we computed all lowest order inelastic charge transfer processes which can be involved in the measurement of noise : the photo - assisted transfer of single ( and pairs of ) electrons ( with energies within the gap ) into quasiparticle(s ) above the gap , and photo - assisted andreev transfer of electrons as a cooper pair in the subgap regime .",
    "it was shown that the latter process dominates when the source drain bias is kept well within the gap .",
    "close but below the gap , the absorption of quasiparticle dominates , and we observe a crossover in the current between the andreev and quasiparticle contributions . for the above processes , we demonstrated the dependence of the dc current on the voltage bias of the mesoscopic device , chosen here to be a quantum point contact . when this bias @xmath118 is increased , the overall amplitude of the spectral density and its width scale as @xmath210 , so that the phase space ( the energy range ) of electrons which can contribute to the andreev processes is magnified .",
    "we therefore have gained an understanding about how the measurement of the dc current can provide useful information on the noise of the mesoscopic device .",
    "nevertheless , one should point out that with this ns setup , it is difficult to isolate the contribution of the photo - assisted current which involves , respectively , the absorption and the emission of photons from the mesoscopic device . for biases close to the chemical potential of the superconductor , both will typically contribute to the photo - assisted current .",
    "next , we considered a more complex detector circuit where the normal metal and the superconductor are separated by a quantum dot which can only accommodate a single electron at a given time . there , the dot acts as an additional energy filtering device , with the aim of achieving a selection between photon emission and absorption processes .",
    "we decided to restrict ourselves to the photo - assisted andreev ( subgap ) regime , assuming that the dot level is well within the gap . by computing the total excess photo - assisted current as well as its different contributions for absorption and emission , and",
    "right and left currents , we found that for dc bias voltages comparable to @xmath211 it is possible to make such a distinction .",
    "the nds detection setup could therefore provide more information on the spectral density of noise than the ns setup , but its diagnosis would involve the measurement of smaller currents than the ns setup , because of the presence of two tunnel barriers instead of one .    note that normal lead  quantum dot  superconductor setups have already been investigated theoretically@xcite and experimentally recently @xcite . in such works ,",
    "the emphasis was to study how the physics of andreev reflection affected the kondo anomaly in the current voltage characteristics . in ref .",
    ", the quantum dot consisted of a carbon nanotube making the junction between a normal metal lead and a superconductor . here , we did not consider the quantum dot in the kondo regime , and we included interactions on the dot in the coulomb blockade regime .    a central point of this study is the fact that all contributions to the photo - assisted current , for both the ns and nds setups , can be cast in the same form : @xmath212 where @xmath213 is a kernel which depends on the nature ( elastic or inelastic ) as well as the mechanism ( single quasi - particle or pair tunneling ) of the charge transfer process .",
    "when dealing with an elastic process , one understand that the environment renormalizes the dc current even when no photon are exchanged between the two circuits . in the case of inelastic tunneling",
    "only , the frequency @xmath179 corresponds to the total energy of the two electrons which enter ( exit ) the superconductor from ( to ) the normal metal lead . finally , the sign of the frequency ( and thus the bound of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ general_pat ] ) , which are left `` blank '' here ) decides whether a given contribution corresponds to the absorption or to the emission of a photon from the mesoscopic circuit .",
    "the present proposal has been tested using a quantum point contact as a noise source , because the spectral density of excess noise is well characterized and because it has a simple form .",
    "it would be useful to test the present model to situations where the noise spectrum exhibits cusps or singularities .",
    "cusps are known to occur in the high frequency ( close to the gap ) noise of normal superconducting junctions .",

    "such singularities or cusps should be easy to recognize in our proposed measurement of the photo - assisted current .    on general grounds ,",

    "<S> andreev reflection , which corresponds to the tunneling of two electrons from a metallic lead to a superconductor lead as a cooper pair ( or vice versa ) , can be exploited to measure high frequency noise . </S>",
    "<S> a detector is proposed , which consists of a normal lead  superconductor circuit , which is capacitively coupled to a mesoscopic circuit where noise is to be measured . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two detector circuits : a single normal metal  superconductor tunnel junction and a normal metal separated from a superconductor by a quantum dot operating in the coulomb blockade regime . </S>",
    "<S> a substantial dc current flows in the detector circuit when an appropriate photon is provided or absorbed by the mesoscopic circuit , which plays the role of an environment for the junction to which it couples . </S>",
    "<S> results for the current can be cast in all cases in the form of a frequency integral of the excess noise of the environment weighted by a kernel which is specific to the transport process ( quasiparticle tunneling , andreev reflection , ... ) which is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we apply these ideas to the measurement of the excess noise of a quantum point contact and we provide numerical estimates of the detector current . </S>"
