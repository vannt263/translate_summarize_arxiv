    "low - amplitude variables are difficult to identify and classify , yet determining their true nature is astrophysically important .",
    "lee and carney ( 1999 ) and miceli et al . (",
    "2008 ) have shown that the oosterhoff type i ( oo i ) and the oosterhoff type ii ( oo ii ) _ field _ rr lyrae stars have different galactic distributions and hence , presumably , different origins .",
    "oosterhoff types are defined not only by the period distributions of their rr0 ( type _ ab _ ) and rr1 ( type _ c _ ) variables but also by the relative numbers of these two rr lyrae types .",
    "thus the rr1 ( type _ c _ ) comprise 45% of all the rr lyrae stars in the oo ii globular clusters but only 20% in the ooi globular clusters ( clement et al . 2001 ) . in recent large surveys for field",
    "rr lyrae stars , rr1 variables comprised 17% of the total in the quest survey ( vivas et al . 2004 ) and 22% of the total in the sdss stripe 82 survey ( watkins et al .",
    "2009 ) indicating oo i populations in both cases .",
    "akerlof et al .. ( 2000 ) ( hereafter aab ) , on the other hand , study a 2000 deg@xmath0 field of the @xmath4 all - sky survey , survey .",
    "we refer to the complete northern sky variability survey ( wozniak et al . ,",
    "2004 ) as the @xmath5 . ] and find that 38% of their rr lyrae stars are rr1 ( type _ c _ ) .",
    "problematically , this suggests an oo ii population although the period distribution shown in aab ( fig .",
    "8) is that of a predominantly oo i population .",
    "the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 surveys all use ccd photometry which ( unlike the older photographic surveys ) can be used to detect the relatively low - amplitude rr1 ( type @xmath1 ) variables with reasonable completeness .",
    "the @xmath8 survey , for example , lists variables with amplitudes as low as 0.1 mag  significantly lower than the amplitudes of most rr1 ( type _ c _ ) .",
    "amrose & mckay ( 2001 ) did not include the rr1 ( type _ c _ ) in their discussion of the _ rotse1 _ rr lyrae variables because they considered their classification less robust than that of the rr0 ( type _ ab _ ) .",
    "we also note that the stars that aab classify as rr1 ( type @xmath1 ) tend to be brighter and to have lower reduced proper motions than those that they classify as rr0 ( type @xmath2 ) ; this suggests that we should review the classification of the lower amplitude rr lyrae stars in the @xmath8 survey .",
    "recently , hoffman et al . (",
    "2009 ) have re - classified the brighter variables in the @xmath5 using fourier coefficients . even in this bright sample ,",
    "they say  without color information and higher precision photometry , the w uma and rrc variables can not easily be differentiated \" and in their summary they cite the w uma / rrc degeneracy problem as a major source of misclassification .",
    "blomme et al .",
    "( 2010 ) mention the problem in their discussion of the new kepler data and it surely will be a problem in the pipeline analysis of pan - starrs and lsst variable star data .",
    "in this paper we consider a 246 deg@xmath0 field near the north galactic pole ( ngp ) defined by 186.@xmath95@xmath10 r.a.@xmath10 204.@xmath90 and + 23.@xmath90@xmath10 dec.@xmath10 + 39.@xmath90 ( fig .",
    "this is part of the 2000 deg@xmath0 test field @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to discussing the data given by aab , we use the general catalogue of variable stars ( @xmath11 ) ( samus 2005 ) and various sources discussed in the appendix ( a ) .",
    "aab identified 33 rr lyrae stars in this field ; one of these ( j130441.22 + 381804.50 ) is the same as j130441.18 + 381805.1 and is ignored .",
    "aab classified 9 as rr1 ( type _ c _ ) and 23 as rr0 ( type _ ab _ ) .",
    "two of these rr1 ( u com and vw cvn ) are given in the @xmath11 .",
    "u com has been studied in detail ( bono et al .",
    "2000 ) and its classification is secure .",
    "vw cvn , however , is classified as an eclipsing binary in both the @xmath11 and simbad .",
    "it is also included in a recent catalogue of eclipsing variables ( malkov et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "aab classify vw cvn as rr1 ( type _ c _ ) and it is clear from the light curve given by agerer and berthold ( 1994 ) that this classification is the correct one with a period of 0.425 days and not ( as originally thought ) an eclipsing system with twice this period .",
    "_ this confusion over the nature of a 12th magnitude star shows that the classification of rr1 variables from low s / n data is not trivial_.    the 21 @xmath8 rr lyrae stars in our field that are in the @xmath11 are listed in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath8 data for the other 11 rr lyrae variables are given in table  2 .",
    "further information on these stars is given in the notes to this table .",
    "apart from vw cvn , we assume that the @xmath11 classifications given in table 1 are correct but that the classifications of the stars in table  2 need to checked through new photometry , spectroscopy and a rediscussion of the @xmath5 photometry for these variables .",

    "spectra can be used to distinguish high - metallicity foreground eclipsing stars of the disk from low - metallicity variables that belong to the extended low - rotation halo .",
    "we obtained short integrations with the mmt blue - channel spectrograph of all the stars in table 2 except j130705.50 + 365757.1 .",
    "details of these flux - calibrated spectra ( that cover @xmath28 3600  4500  ) are given in table 5 .",
    "the spectral resolution was 1.0   for all the spectra except those of j133204.15 + 385533.7 and j133234.47 + 351949.5 for which it was 1.2  .",
    "the spectra have s / n in the range 50 to 100 and yield radial velocities with accuracies of 2 to 3 km s@xmath29 ; the balmer lines and ca ii k - line equivalent widths can be used to determine the metallicity ( [ fe / h ) .",
    "no calibrating standard stars were observed , however , so we could only measure pseudo equivalent widths from which non - standard metallicities were derived .",
    "we denote these by [ m / h]@xmath30 .",
    "preston ( 1959 ) showed that the difference between the spectral types of the balmer lines and the ca ii k - line of rr lyrae stars at minimum light gives an index ( @xmath31 ) that measures the metallicity of the star .",
    "these spectral types should be derived from the equivalent widths using a calibration given by spectra of stars of known spectral type that are taken concurrently with those of the program stars .",
    "since we had no standards , we used the equivalent width _ vs. _ spectral type calibration given by kinman & carretta ( 1992 ) ; the resulting non - standard indices ( denoted by @xmath31@xmath30 ) were converted to [ m / h]@xmath30 using the calibration of suntzeff et al .",
    "these metallicities are approximate not only because of the rough calibration of the equivalent widths but also because some of the spectra were taken at phases near maximum light where the conversion of @xmath31 to [ fe / h ] is known to be inaccurate . despite these limitations ,",
    "the mean @xmath31@xmath30 for the rr lyraes ( + 4.6 @xmath12 1.0 ) differs significantly from that of the eclipsing stars ( 1.9 @xmath12 1.8 ) in the sense that the rr lyrae stars have halo abundances ( [ fe / h]@xmath100.8 ) while those of the eclipsing stars are more nearly solar ( table 5 ) .",
    "the metallicities of rr lyrae stars can also be derived from their light - curves .",
    "smooth curves ( drawn by eye through the data points ) were used to derive the fourier coefficient @xmath32 , the @xmath14-amplitude and the rise - time .",
    "non - standard metallicities",
    "[ m / h]@xmath30",
    "were then derived from these quantities using the equations ( 3 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) respectively of sandage ( 2004 ) .",
    "the use of hand - drawn light curves necessarily gives approximate results but we see ( table 6 ) that these three metallicity estimates not only agree well among themselves but also with the spectroscopic values .",
    "our adopted [ m / h]@xmath30 is based on the three photometric and the spectroscopic values . also , the [ m / h]@xmath30 of 0.9 and 1.9 that we adopt for j123854.21 + 245307.9 and j130441.18 + 381805.1 are in reasonable agreement with the 1.2 and 2.2 respectively that kinemuchi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) give for these stars .",
    "we also measured the width ( fwhm of a gaussian fit ) of the mg ii @xmath334481 doublet ( table 5 ) .",
    "this width is frequently used as a measure of rotational broadening ( slettebak , 1954 ) . in our data , this width is significantly larger for the eclipsing systems than for the rr lyrae stars .",
    "the rr lyrae stars are known to have quite narrow lines ( peterson et al . ,",
    "1996 ) while those of the eclipsing systems should be broadened both by rotation and orbital motion .",
    "this broadening should be least for those that are seen pole - on and thus for those with the lowest amplitudes .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "7 , that , in the case of the eclipsing stars , the fwhm of the mg ii @xmath334481 line does indeed decrease with the decreasing amplitude of the star .",
    "extrapolated to zero amplitude , this width would be about 2.4  .",
    "this may be compared with the mean width for the rr lyrae stars ( 1.7@xmath120.15 ) which presumably is close to the instrumental width .      .",
    "absolute magnitudes for the rr lyrae stars were obtained from : @xmath34 + 0.86\\ ] ] using the coefficients given by clementini et al .",
    "absolute magnitudes for the eclipsing systems were obtained from the calibration for w uma - type binary stars given by rucinski ( 2000 ) : @xmath35 the distances given in table 6 are based on these @xmath36 .",
    "then , following johnson & soderblom ( 1987 ) , the radial velocities ( table 5 ) and proper motions ( ucac3 catalog : zacharias et al . , 2009",
    ") were used to calculate the heliocentric galactic rotation velocities ( v ) given in table 6 .",
    "the radial velocities that we give for the rr lyrae stars in table 5 have been converted to @xmath37-velocities following liu ( 1991 ) . as we noted above",
    ", the faintest of our rr lyrae stars have ucac3 proper motions whose errors are comparable with the proper motions themselves .",
    "nevertheless , the range in v that we find for the rr lyraes is quite different from that which we find for the eclipsing stars ; they correspond to what we would expect for halo and disk stars respectively .",
    "the galactic rotations in table 6 are only valid if our reclassications are correct .",
    "we have therefore repeated the calculations assuming that the six stars that we have reclassified as eclipsing binaries are in fact rrc stars as originally classified by aab .",
    "the results are shown in table 7 . in this case , the mean galactic rotation of the six stars that we reclassified is 45@xmath1231 km s@xmath29 and the dispersion in v for these stars is 69@xmath1220 km s@xmath29 . _ thus , the galactic rotation ( v ) alone only tells us that these six stars could be disk stars and either be eclipsing binaries or metal - rich disk rr lyrae stars . _",
    "the most doubtful classification is that of j133234.47 + 351949.5 whose galactic rotation v and metallicity are compatible with it belonging to the halo .",
    "the large fwhm of its mg ii @xmath33 4481 line , however , makes it more likely that it is an eclipsing binary .    as would be expected for a disk population , the six stars that we reclassified as eclipsing systems have essentially zero mean radial velocity ( 22@xmath1220 km s@xmath29 ) .",
    "the rr lyrae stars , on the other hand , show a mean radial velocity that is strongly negative ( 135@xmath1245 km s@xmath29 ) .",
    "this downward streaming of halo stars at the north galactic pole was first discovered among subdwarfs by majewski et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "similar streaming in this part of the sky has since been also found among rr lyrae and and bhb stars ( kinman et al . , 1996 , 2006 ) and",
    "the velocities in table 5 give further confirmation of the effect .",
    "this downward motion towards the plane occurs a few kpc above the plane but does not continue to the solar neighborhood ( seagrove et al .",
    "2008 ) ; it presumably is one of the many tidal streams that are known to exist in the halo .",
    "we use johnson @xmath23 photometry and mmt spectroscopy to study eleven stars ( table 2 ) classified by aab as rr lyraes .",
    "our observations support the rr lyrae classifications for the five stars with the largest amplitudes , however , we find that the six low - amplitude stars classified by akerlof et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as rr1 ( type @xmath1 ) should be reclassified as eclipsing binaries .",
    "we derive metallicities from both spectra and light curves and find a halo abundance for the rr lyrae stars and a solar abundance for the eclipsing binaries .",
    "the fwhm line widths of the mg ii @xmath334481 line provide a clean separation between rr lyrae stars and eclipsing variables so that , in principle , a single moderate s / n spectrum with a resolution of 1   can provide enough information to distinguish between a pulsating variable and an eclipsing binary even when the amplitude is quite low .",
    "supporting evidence comes from the absence of color variation in eclipsing variables , and the differing kinematics of the two types of variables .",
    "our observations resolve the problematic over - abundance of rr1 ( type @xmath1 ) reported by aab .",
    "they found that 38% of their rr lyrae stars were rr1 ( type @xmath1 ) , yet about half this number would have been expected from the oo  i period distribution of these stars . in our 246 deg@xmath0 field , there are 16 rr lyrae stars with m@xmath3 @xmath38 14.5 .",
    "we find 4 rr1 ( type @xmath1 ) , including bs com discussed in appendix a , and 12 rr0 ( type @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus in our small sample , 25% of of the rr lyrae stars are rr1 ( type @xmath1 ) ; this is in statistical agreement with that expected from the period distribution . in the future",
    ", it would be desirable to investigate the classification of larger samples of the lower - amplitude rr lyrae stars from the aab test fields .",
    "also many of the rr1 ( type _ c _ ) variables in the @xmath39 catalog are also classified as possible eclipsing stars ; reclassification of these stars using the techniques suggested here would also be very desirable .",
    "we thank the director of the lowell observatory for allowing tdk to use the lowell 42-inch telescope for this work and also dr david schleicher ( lowell ) both for help in using the kron photometer and in the preliminary reduction of the data .",
