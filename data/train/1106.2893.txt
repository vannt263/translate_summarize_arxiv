    "first studied for their ionic conduction properties  @xcite , the layered cobalt oxides have been , in the last years , the object of a regained attention , due to the discovery of peculiar transport and magnetic properties .",
    "one can cite , for instance , the superconducting state of the @xmath5 ,  @xcite the large thermoelectric power ( tep ) in the @xmath6 ,  @xcite or the rich phases diagram of the @xmath7 family .",
    "@xcite in terms of applications the large thermoelectric power ( tep ) found in some materials of this family is certainly the most interesting property .",
    "indeed , in addition to seebeck coefficients larger than @xmath8 at room temperature , these systems present the atypical association of a low resistivity and a low thermal conductivity .",
    "it results a large figure of merit @xmath9 at room temperature  @xcite ( where @xmath10 is the factor of merit , @xmath11 the seebeck coefficient , @xmath12 the temperature , @xmath13 the electrical resistivity , @xmath14 the thermal conductivity ) .",
    "the motivation was at the origin the search for new compounds , based on the same @xmath15 layers ( known to be responsible for the electronic and magnetic properties ) , but with better chemical stability than the @xmath16 ones .",
    "indeed , in air , these systems can both easily accept water or other small molecules in between the @xmath15 layers and loose part of their sodium content , both processes affecting the desired properties .",
    "the main idea was to replace the alkaline layer by a more complex oxide one .",
    "many systems were thus synthesized such as @xmath17_{1+x}coo_2 $ ] ,  @xcite @xmath18_{3 + 3x/2}coo_2 $ ] ( @xmath19 )  @xcite , @xmath20 ,  @xcite etc .    among these layered cobalt oxides ,",
    "the so - called @xmath21  @xcite ( @xmath22_{0.62}[coo_2]$ ] ) occupies a special place .",
    "indeed , this chemically `` simple '' system has been used as the reference system for the study of the thermoelectric properties in @xmath23-based compounds .",
    "in addition to its interesting thermoelectric properties the @xmath0 present puzzling magnetic transitions  @xcite with the inset of an incommensurate spin density wave ( ic - sdw ) at low temperature , an often called `` ferrimagnetic '' transition around 19  k and a transition interpreted as a cobalt spin state transition around 380  k. the long - range ic - sdw sets in place at 27  k however from 100  k a short range ic - sdw order is observed by muon relaxation  @xcite .    the @xmath0 system is built from the alternation of @xmath24-type @xmath15 layers and @xmath25 rock - salt - type layers  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "f : struc ] ) .",
    "these layers are stacked along the @xmath26-axis and present incommensurate lattice parameters along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "the @xmath15 layers are built from edge - sharing cobalt octahedra presenting a compression along the @xmath26 crystallographic direction ( the octahedra ( 111 ) direction ) .",
    "the rock - salt layers are three - fold layers built from two ca - o planes sandwiching a co - o plane , or equivalently built from a layer of cobalt octahedra , as in a rock - salt structure .",
    "the incommensurability between the @xmath27 lattice parameters of the two subsystems induces , in each layer , a structural modulation presenting the periodicity of the other subsystem .",
    "one of the important consequences is a distortion of the coordination sphere of each cobalt atom in the @xmath15 layers ( different co - co distances , different co - o distances and co - o - co angles ) .",
    "indeed , the @xmath15 subsystem has been shown to be responsible for the low energy properties of the compound ( transport , tep , magnetism , etc . ) , since it supports the fermi level electrons  @xcite while the @xmath25 subsystem was proved to be gapped .",
    "in addition , in the related @xmath1 family the fermi level properties were proved to be strongly dependant both on the doping  @xcite and on the local structural parameters  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work will thus be to study the effect of the incommensurate modulations on the low energy degrees of freedom of the @xmath21 system . at this point",
    "one should notice that , unfortunately , density functional ( dft ) electronic structure calculations fail to properly describe the electronic structure of the @xmath15-based systems .",
    "indeed , lda as well as lda+u calculations  @xcite exhibit a conducting @xmath28 subsystem dominating the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "dft is known to illy treat strong correlation effects , however , in many strongly correlated systems , it is nevertheless able to yield reasonable fermi surfaces and the correct magnetic ground state . in the @xmath15-based systems , this is not the case . in the @xmath1 compounds dft calculations yield a ferromagnetic ground state  @xcite , while experimentally antiferromagnetic  @xcite , and incorrect fermi surfaces  @xcite .",
    "we will thus need to rely on alternating approaches , such as embedded cluster quantum chemical methods , explicitely treating the strong correlation at the fermi level .",
    "such methods also present the advantages to be able to treat the misfit character of the system .",
    "for this purpose we will use the same ab initio method that gave accurate and reliable results on the evaluation of such local effective parameters in other strongly correlated systems , that is the embedded fragment cas+ddci method  @xcite .",
    "this method yielded very good results in systems such as the copper or vanadium oxides  @xcite , the @xmath29  @xcite , etc .",
    ", in periodic systems as well as misfit ones  @xcite .",
    "the modulated structures will be taken from reference  .",
    "we will compute the magnetic effective exchange between two nearest neighbors ( nn ) cobalt ions , the effective transfer , the correlation strength and the on - site parameters variations that could be responsible for electron localization .",
    "the embedded fragment cas+ddci method is a spectroscopy method specifically designed to accurately treat the strongly correlated character of a set of orbitals ( designed as active or magnetic orbitals ) , as well as the screening effects on all processes on this set of magnetic orbitals .",
    "such a calculation implies large diagonalizations and can only be done on a formally finite system . to reach the desired goals , the diagonalized configurations space includes ( 1 ) all configurations that can be built within the magnetic orbitals ( complete active space or cas ) , ( 2 ) all single and double excitations on each of the previous configurations , except for the double excitations not contributing to the excitations energies in a perturbative analysis .",
    "such a choice insures a proper treatment of the correlation effect on the cobalt @xmath30 shell as well as the screening effects on the cobalt @xmath30 electrons  @xcite .",
    "the embedded fragments are thus composed of a quantum part , treated within the cas+ddci quantum chemical method , and an embedding that reproduces the main effects of the rest of the crystal on the quantum part .",
    "the quantum part should include the cobalt ions involved in the sought interaction and their first coordination shell .",
    "the main effects of the rest of the crystal on the quantum part are double .",
    "first , there is the short range exclusion of the quantum electrons from the space occupied by the electrons of the rest of the crystal .",
    "this effect is modeled using total ions pseudo - potentials  @xcite ( tips ) that represent the electronic structure of the first shells of atoms surrounding the quantum part .",
    "the second important effect is the madelung potential . for this purpose",
    ", we used a set of renormalized charges .",
    "as far as the two periodic directions are concerned , we used the real space method developed by a. gell _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that reproduces the madelung potential with an exponential convergence . for the incommensurate direction",
    ", we used the same method as in reference  , imposing the nullity of both charge and dipole moment .",
    "the question is now _ ",
    "what formal charges should we use for the different atoms in order to build the embedding  ?  _ .",
    "the calcium and oxygen atoms will be taken as @xmath31 and @xmath32 ions .",
    "the question of the cobalt valence is a bit more difficult .",
    "indeed , there is no reason for the cobalts to present the same valency in the two subsystems .",
    "two arguments can help us in finding a reasonable evaluation of the charge transfer between the two layers .",
    "the first argument is a simple comparison between the average first neighbor cobalt  oxygen distances in the @xmath15 layers for @xmath0 and for the @xmath1 family . with an average co  o distance of @xmath33",
    "the cobalt valence could be estimated from figure  5 of reference   to be similar to the @xmath34 system , that is about @xmath35 in the @xmath15 layer , and thus @xmath36 in the rock - salt layer .",
    "the second argument comes from a recent evaluation of the cobalt valency using atomic - column resolved energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels )  @xcite .",
    "indeed klie _ et al _ found a single valency of @xmath37 in the rock - salt layers and a mixed valency in the @xmath15 layers .",
    "we thus used a @xmath37 formal charge for the rock - salt subsystem and , insuring electro - neutrality , a @xmath38 formal charge for the @xmath15 subsystem .",
    "such evaluations of the cobalts valences correspond to average values within each layer and , at this point , one could wonder about the effects of the fluctuations around these values , on the madelung potential acting on the fragments . as a matter of example",
    "let us evaluate the order of magnitude of the potential modification due to an oxygen vacancy in the rock - salt layer , located in the close vicinity ( @xmath3910 ) of the fragment ( located in the @xmath15 layer ) .",
    "the relative modification of the madelung potential , at an atomic position within the quantum fragment , scales as @xmath40 .",
    "the relative fluctuation of the potential gradient ( the important degree of freedom for our calculations ) is even weaker .",
    "in addition , the later should be partly compensated by a modification of the valency of the cobalt atoms , located in the vicinity of the vacancy within the rock - salt layer .",
    "one can thus expect that such fluctuations , provided their randomness and scarcity will little affect the reliability of our results . in the quantum calculations , the core electrons where treated using effective core potentials  @xcite , while the valence and semi - valence electrons where treated using the associated gaussian atomic basis set  @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath15 subsystem of the @xmath0 compound , the cobalt ions are in a mixed valence state @xmath37 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "it is sometimes written in the literature  @xcite that the @xmath37 ions are in a low spin state while the @xmath42 ions are in a high spin state .",
    "this assumption is in contradiction with what was found for the @xmath1 family where both cobalt ions are in a low spin state   @xmath44 and @xmath45 . since these @xmath30 orbitals are responsible for the physical properties , it is of prime importance to first understand the cobalt @xmath30 orbital splitting and spin states .",
    "we thus computed the different spin states of a @xmath46 embedded fragment ( @xmath37 as well as @xmath42 ionic states ) for all crystallographically independent cobalt sites in the periodic directions , and a representative set of them in the misfit direction .",
    "we found that in all cases both the @xmath37 and @xmath42 ions are in a low spin state .",
    "indeed , even for the @xmath42 valence state the higher spin states are at least at 700  mev ( @xmath47k ) above the low spin state .    as in the @xmath1 family ,",
    "the @xmath46 octahedra are compressed along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "one thus expects a splitting of the regular octahedron @xmath48 orbitals into a doublet @xmath49 and a singlet @xmath2 .",
    "the energetic order between these orbitals is crucial since it determines the nature of the magnetic orbitals of the @xmath42 ions .",
    "a simple crystal field evaluation yields the @xmath49 orbitals at the fermi level .",
    "however , it was shown that due to the @xmath50 to @xmath51 symmetry reduction , the @xmath49 orbitals can and do hybridize with the high energy @xmath52 ones .",
    "it results an energetic stabilization of the @xmath53 orbitals compared to the @xmath2 one and thus a non degenerated atomic ground state for the @xmath42 ions  @xcite  : @xmath54 . in the present system",
    "the misfit character of the two subsystems tells us that further symmetry breaking occurs and that all cobalt @xmath30 orbitals are non degenerated .",
    "figure  [ fig : split ] displays the @xmath55 orbital energy splitting as a function of the fourth crystallographic dimension parameter ( @xmath56 refers to the @xmath15 subsystem cells in the @xmath27 direction   see figure  [ fig : dimer ]   @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the lattice parameters of the two subsystems in the incommensurate direction ) associated with the incommensurate modulations of the @xmath15 layers .",
    "let us recall that this structural modulation takes place along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "these effective orbital splittings where obtained as the energy difference of fully correlated @xmath59 and @xmath60 states of the @xmath46 embedded fragments .",
    "indeed , this excitation energy can be associated with the effective orbital splitting of a 3-bands hubbard model .",
    "one sees immediately that whatever the co site , the @xmath2 orbital is always of higher energy than the @xmath61 ones  ; that is the hole is always located in the @xmath2 orbital .",
    "the excitation energy for having a hole located in a @xmath61 orbital is always larger than @xmath62 .",
    "the average @xmath63 splitting is 261mev , while the difference between the two @xmath61 orbitals ranges between 13mev to 42mev .",
    "finally one should notice that the variations of the @xmath64 splitting as a function of the different crystallographic sites remains small ( @xmath65mev ) .",
    "as mentioned above the relative position of the @xmath2 and @xmath61 orbitals are related to the @xmath61@xmath52 hybridization . as expected from the weak modulation of the orbital energy splitting ,",
    "this hybridization remains stable , close for all sites to its average value of @xmath66 degrees .",
    "this value is very comparable to the values found on different @xmath29 systems  @xcite .",
    "the previous section clearly told us that the @xmath2@xmath61 orbital splitting is large enough ( @xmath67 ) to justify a on - band model for our system . in this section",
    ", we will thus extract from our calculations , both the effective exchange integrals , and the parameters of an extended hubbard model .",
    "the nn effective exchange can be obtained as the energy difference between the singlet and triplet states of the @xmath68 embedded fragments .",
    "the extended hubbard model parameters necessitate in addition the states wave functions information . indeed , the parameters are determined so that the model reproduce both the singlet  triplet excitation energy , and the relative weight of the dominant configurations , in the states wave functions .",
    "one should however notice that , not all the parameters of the extended hubbard model , can be independently determined from the data .",
    "indeed , only the nn hopping integral  : @xmath69 , the difference between the average on - site repulsion and the nn repulsion  : @xmath70 and the difference between the orbital energies and the on - site repulsions  : @xmath71 can be independently determined .    in this non - periodic system ,",
    "the models parameters were determined for a representative set ( sixteen dimers were computed ) of incommensurate distortions values , then fitted as a function of the incommensurate dimension parameter @xmath72 .",
    "one can define two types of non equivalent nearest neighbor dimers that propagate along the incommensurate @xmath27 direction ( see figure  [ fig : dimer ] ) ; the a dimers ( @xmath73 direction ) and the c dimers ( @xmath74 direction ) .",
    "indeed , the b and d dimers can be deduced from the preceeding ones , through the expressions : @xmath75 in the following discussions , we will refer to `` @xmath74 direction dimers '' for the c and d dimers and to `` @xmath76 directions dimers '' for the a and b ones .      figure  [ fig : j_tau](a ) reports the variations of the effective exchange integral @xmath77 and figure  [ fig : j_tau](b ) of the effective hopping integral @xmath69 , as a function of the fourth crystallographic dimension parameter @xmath72",

    "the fitted values are associated with equations  [ eq : fit ] . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the on - site repulsion being considered constant , the energy difference between nn @xmath2 orbitals can be extracted from our results .",
    "figure  [ fig : delta ] reports the effective @xmath2 orbital energy  : @xmath79 ( @xmath80 being taken as the energy reference ) .",
    "one can see that the amplitude of the @xmath79 modulations is quite large ( @xmath81mev ) .",
    "compared to this modulation , the @xmath2@xmath3 energy splitting is negligible with an amplitude 10 times weaker .",
    "it results that the @xmath79 modulation can be seen as an effective potential on the whole cobalt atom .",
    "associated with the strong nn repulsion v  @xcite , one can thus expect a partial charge localization , with @xmath37 ions on the low energy sites .",
    "this result agrees with the observations on the @xmath1 family for which a partial charge localization is observed for @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "let us now take a closer look on the seebeck coefficient in the @xmath21 system .",
    "the first point to be stressed is the fact that the tep can be quite different according to the intercalation layer ( @xmath83  @xcite , @xmath84_{0.62}[coo_2])\\simeq 120 \\mu v / k$ ]  @xcite , @xmath85_2[coo_2]_{1.69})\\simeq 160 \\mu v / k$ ]  @xcite ) .",
    "the second point is the shape of the seebeck coefficient as a function of temperature . at low temperature",
    "the seebeck coefficient increases quasi - linearly up to @xmath39100k and then saturates to a constant value up to about @xmath39400k  @xcite .",
    "these two behaviors can be fitted on a correlated fermi liquid behavior , for the low temperature part  @xcite ( @xmath86 ) , and on a heikes type of configurational entropy for the saturating part  @xcite ( 150k@xmath87 400k ) .",
    "the generalized heikes formula  @xcite is a high temperature approximation .",
    "it supposes that the system is at very large temperature compared to the scale of the low energy degrees of freedom . in the present compound we showed ( see section  [ atome ] ) that these degrees of freedom are associated with the @xmath2 orbital of the @xmath15 layers cobalt atoms @xmath30-shell . using this formula and the non - degenerated character of the magnetic @xmath2 orbital , one finds ( using a cobalt valency of 3.38 as discussed previously in section  [ methode ] ) , a tep value of @xmath88 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the experimental value of @xmath89 found for the @xmath90 saturation plateau  @xcite .",
    "one may conclude from this agreement that , at room temperature , the high temperature limit of the triangular one band model based on the @xmath2 orbitals is already reached .",
    "however , room temperature only corresponds to 25mev , while the band width of a tight binding model on a triangular lattice is @xmath91  ; using our present transfer estimations ( @xmath92 ) it comes a band width of the order of 10000k .",
    "how can we account for such a large difference in order of magnitude ?",
    "why does the heikes model fits so nicely the room temperature seebeck coefficient for the @xmath15-based compounds ?",
    "different arguments can be advanced in order to explain this high temperature behavior of the tep at 300k .",
    "+ let us first analyze the behavior of the seebeck coefficient , as a function of temperature within a one - band tight binding model on a triangular lattice . the boltzmann equation yields the following seebeck expression @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the fermi function , @xmath95 the orbitals energy , @xmath96 the electrochemical potential  ; the collision time as well as the degeneracy is supposed energy independent",
    ". figure  [ fig : seebeck ] reports @xmath97 and its two components @xmath98 and @xmath99 . at low temperature",
    "@xmath98 dominates , reaches a maximum for @xmath100 , then slowly decreases toward zero in the high temperature limit . on the contrary the entropic part @xmath99 increases for all temperatures and reaches its high temperature limit for temperatures of the order of a few band widths .",
    "the sum of the two terms results in a seebeck coefficient reaching its saturation value at much lower temperature than its entropic part .",
    "indeed for @xmath101 , @xmath11 is already larger than 90% of its high temperature value .",
    "this simple analysis already allows us to reduce , from a few band widths to half the band width , the estimation of the temperature at which the tep saturation should be observed .",
    "this is however not enough to account for the observed saturation temperature .",
    "indeed @xmath102 still accounts for about 5000k .",
    "+    a second argument is the extremely large value of the correlation strength in these compounds . indeed ,",
    "our calculations yield for the average @xmath103 a value of 26 . despite this very large @xmath103 ,",
    "transport measurements  @xcite find the system metallic .",
    "one thus expect its fermi level quasi - particle pic to be strongly renormalized due to the strong correlation effects  @xcite .",
    "+ finally let us remember that our results suggest a partial electron localization due the large site energy modulation ( @xmath104 ) and a large value of nn repulsion .",
    "it results that the lattice pattern seen by the fermi level electrons can be expected to be quite different from the homogeneous triangular lattice assumed in these systems .",
    "this effect is also expected to strongly reduce the quasi - particle bandwidth at the fermi level .",
    "+ all together , it seems quite possible that the bandwidth reduction is large enough ( 20 to 30 times ) so that @xmath105 , and thus that the high temperature heikes model appears valid for the present ( and related ) systems .",
    "let us now take a look on the tep behavior at temperatures larger than 400k .",
    "indeed , at @xmath106 the @xmath0 compound experiences a first - order metal - semiconductor phase transition associated with a linear increase of the seebeck coefficient for @xmath107  @xcite .",
    "different hypotheses have been proposed in order to account for this phase transition and the high temperature phase properties .",
    "the first one associates the transition with a cobalt spin - state transition  @xcite .",
    "however our calculations show that the first atomic excited spin state of the cobalt atom is at least at 700mev , i.e. 8100k , above the ground state .",
    "such an energy difference is clearly incompatible with a phase transition energy scale of 400k .",
    "the second hypothesis associates the transition with a change in the cobalt @xmath48 orbitals occupancies .",
    "however this hypothesis does not resist to the energy scale of the @xmath2@xmath3 energy splitting found in section  [ atome ] . indeed , the 240mev@xmath1082800k is still far too large for the 400k energy scale of the transition .",
    "the last hypothesis is an electron localization of the @xmath3 orbitals , associated with a structural phase transition  @xcite . even if the assumption that the @xmath3 orbitals are the fermi level ones has been proven incorrect ( see reference   or for the present system section  [ atome ] ) , the idea of an electron localization induced by an increase of the in - plane distances in the @xmath15 layers seem quite possible and would explain the metal - semi - conductor phase transition .",
    "muguera and grebille  @xcite solved the crystallographic structure in the high temperature phase .",
    "they showed that the transition is due to a rearrangement of the central @xmath109 layer of the @xmath110 subsystem .",
    "this rearrangement acts on the @xmath15 layers through the o ",
    "ca interaction between the two subsystems .",
    "it results in a modification of both the cobalts and oxygens modulations ( but not of the average structure ) along the @xmath111 and @xmath26 directions .",
    "while such a weak structural modification can account for the metal - semiconductor transition ( due to the large correlation strength and associated closeness to the mott transition ) , it can not account for the associated increase of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "indeed , such an increase necessitate the opening of new degrees of freedom at the fermi level and the weakness of the structural modifications within the @xmath15 layers can not account the opening of either the higher cobalt spin states or the @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "this study however show us that there is another degree of freedom up to now ignored that should be taken into account , that is the partial charge localization due to the action of the subsystem modulation over the fermi level orbital energies .",
    "indeed a modification of the modulation vector will be expected to modify the energy profile pictured in figure  [ fig : delta ] , thus the charge localization configuration and the lattice pattern seen by the fermi electrons at the given temperature . out of any other energetically compatible hypothesis",
    ", the latter seems the most plausible .",
    "let us now extend our discussion to the other important parameters for the thermoelectric performance .",
    "as we all know , a good figure of merit is associated with a large seebeck coefficient @xmath11 , a low resistivity @xmath13 and a low thermal conductivity @xmath14 .",
    "* we saw in the preceeding paragraphs that the heikes formula is fully justified to describe the seebeck coefficient of the layered cobalt oxides ( provided a large @xmath103 value and a partial charge localization ) .",
    "the heikes formula is a pure entropic one and only depends on the band filling of the @xmath2 cobalts magnetic orbitals of the @xmath15 layer .",
    "thus , as far as @xmath11 is concerned , the misfit character essentially acts ( i ) on the filling of the @xmath15 layer , since the latter should adjust to the incommensurate ratio ( @xmath112 ) in order to preserve the electro - neutrality of the system , ( ii ) on the renormalization of the @xmath2 band width ( through a partial localization ) . in both cases",
    "these are indirect effects ( acting through the electrostatic interaction between the two layers ) and the effect of the specific modulation vectors , or even their incommensurate character , will be expected to modulate the @xmath11 value , but not its order of magnitude . * in these @xmath15-based systems , the observed low resistivity is essentially due to the triangular pattern of the transfer interactions in the @xmath15 layer .",
    "indeed , in a triangular lattice , the mott transition is repelled at very high correlation values , and the system remains essentially metallic ( as experimentally observed in the misfit cobalt oxides which present low metal to insulator transition temperatures , between 50k-80k for the present compound  @xcite , around 20k for the @xmath113[coo_2]_{1.8}$ ] compounds  @xcite or the @xmath114[rho_2]_{1.8}$ ]  @xcite , or even remaining metallic at all temperatures such as the @xmath115_{0.53}[coo_2]$ ]  @xcite ) . as a matter of illustration ,",
    "let us compare the @xmath116  @xcite ratio found for the metal to insulator transition of a half - filled , triangular , hubbard model , and the @xmath117 ratio for the same transition when the transfer interactions pattern is square .",
    "the misfit character can thus be expected to be non relevant compared to the basic triangular interaction pattern as far as the resistivity is concerned . at a higher order of precision ,",
    "however , it is expected to sightly increases the resistivity , through the induced partial localization . *",
    "the main effect of the misfit character is most probably on the thermal conductivity .",
    "indeed , one can expect that the non periodicity and the associated modulated potential seen by otherwise equivalent ions , induce a partial localization of the phonons dispersion and thus a lowering of the thermal conductivity .",
    "this point is however difficult to quantify since it would necessitate a comparative study of the phonons dispersion spectra for different misfit and non misfit @xmath118-based compounds .",
    "we performed ab initio calculations of the effective local parameters of the thermoelectric @xmath0 compound , taking into account the incommensurate distortions .",
    "as in the @xmath29 family , cobalts @xmath2@xmath3 orbitals splitting is large so that the low energy physics can be accounted for using the @xmath2 orbitals only .",
    "we showed that the incommensurate modulation of the @xmath15 layer can not be neglected in order to understand the compound physical properties .",
    "indeed , site energies , nn exchange , nn hopping as well as first neighbor repulsions are strongly modulated due to the misfit character of the system .",
    "it particular the site energies large modulation let us expect a partial fermi electrons localization .",
    "the effective exchange remains weak in amplitude , however fluctuates between antiferromagnetic coupling and ferromagnetic one .",
    "this results can be compared with the on - plane afm - fm transition line in the @xmath1 family associated at @xmath119 with similar cobalt valency as found in the present compound .",
    "we discussed the temperature behavior of the seebeck coefficient and showed that the cobalts @xmath2 orbitals bandwidth is strongly renormalized , due to very strong electron correlation ( @xmath4 ) , and the modification of the effective lattice pattern seen by the itinerant electrons , associated with the partial charge localization .",
    "this strong bandwidth renormalization is most probably responsible for the plateau due to the high temperature behavior observed in the seebeck coefficient on the @xmath120 $ ] range .",
    "we further showed that he sudden increase of the tep for @xmath121 , can not be attributed either to a cobalt spin state change or to a modification of the @xmath2 vs @xmath3 orbitals occupation .",
    "in fact the 396k metal - semiconductor transition is associated with a structural rearrangement within the @xmath122 subsystem inducing a modulation modification within the @xmath15 layer .",
    "this modification induces a site energy pattern change , and thus a localization pattern change , which we think to be the best candidate for the change in the seebeck behavior .",
