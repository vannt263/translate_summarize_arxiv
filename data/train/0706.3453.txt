    "in the last decades both experimentalists and theorists have applied significant forces to understand character of hadron interactions at high energies . as result",
    "many aspects of hadron processes at high energies became clear not only qualitatively but also quantitatively .",
    "the last corresponds to quantum chromodynamics which was able to describe quantitatively many the simplest processes occurring at short distances .",
    "however , it is impossible to count on qcd calculations of the multiple hadron production , these processes have enormous number of degrees of freedom .",
    "thus one has to use different model approaches .",
    "a quantitative description of high energy processes by monte carlo generators can be considered as one of these approaches .",
    "monte carlo generators are perspective method of theoretic study at all energies of the existing accelerators including lhc , since any other approaches , theoretical as the bfkl theory or phenomenological as the regge theory , are only valid to the values of @xmath4 order of magnitude , where @xmath5 is the square of total center - of - mass energy . since even for lhc @xmath6 , then it is necessarily to take into account the next to @xmath4 corrections what is an inexecutable task at the most cases .",
    "therefore it is essentially to construct such mc generator which will describe well processes both in hard and soft regions .    amongst generators describing well hard processes there",
    "is known pythia  @xcite .",
    "still soft processes , i.e. processes with small transverse momenta , are included in pythia only on basis of the simplest phenomenological models , the values of cross sections are not generated .",
    "the multiparticle processes are described with the simplest pomeron model in which only one string is stretched between quark and diquark .",
    "pomeron cuts are not taken into account .",
    "the weakness of pythia is also in absence of the agk sum rules  @xcite .",
    "an oscillation structure in the multiplicity distribution function @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the topological cross section of @xmath9 hadrons production , @xmath10 is the total cross section of hadron - hadron scattering , that can be observed at the lhc energies , follows from the agk rules .",
    "since pythia is the most advanced programm then the future mc generator describing both hard and soft regions , in our opinion , should be based on pythia .    in the present work",
    "we will study how multiplicity distributions obtained with pythia agree with experimental data .",
    "we consider the process of @xmath0 annihailation at 6 values of total center - of - mass energy from 14 to 206.2 gev .",
    "wide coverage of the experimental data and sufficient statistical provision of them were criteria for the choice .",
    "electron - positron annihilation to hadrons was simulated by pythia at @xmath2 14 , 29 , 34.8 , 91.2 , 188.6 , 206.2 gev .",
    "the decay process of @xmath11 was considered without the initial state radiation , values of the other parameters were set by default .",
    "there were generated one million events for every energy , and the charged particles multiplicity distributions were analyzed .",
    "experimentally there were obtained 2704 events ( tasso )  @xcite .",
