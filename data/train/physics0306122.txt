    "the hex farm @xcite was developed for the * h*igh energy physics * ex*perimental group of rutgers university .",
    "the group contains about 20 physicists participating in cdf , cms and other experiments , with about 70the primary goal of the farm is to satisfy computing needs of the cdf group for physics data analysis .",
    "hex farm is a good example of a small analysis farm , as opposed to a big production farm , which serves a typical university group participating in a big hep experiment .",
    "the farm is based on dual cpu pcs running fermi linux @xcite . due to lack of ip addresses on the university campus ,",
    "15 worker nodes are connected in a private network .",
    "big ide disks connected to the worker nodes are cross mounted on every node of the farm .",
    "three special  portal  nodes are connected to both wan and private networks :    * farm header node .",
    "users here interactively prepare and test their jobs .",
    "it also hosts home directories and experiment specific software , and runs nat and nis servers .",
    "* data transfer node .",
    "this is used to pass data between public and private networks .",
    "traffic is mainly data exchange between rutgers and fermilab ; this channel network bandwidth is about 100 mbits / s . * analysis facility header node .",
    "it controls analysis load , runs sam ] , and hosts sam data cache .",
    "this is the only fully kerberized node on the farm .",
    "it is connected to the fermilab kerberos domain .",
    "as most of the jobs running on the farm are related to the cdf experiment , the software and computer setup is mostly inherited from standard cdf installations@xcite .",
    "to minimize compatibility issues , the hex farm uses cdf approved components for resource management . cpu usage and data storage are farm resources essential to manage .",
    "we installed batch system developed for and used on the cdf central analysis facility ( caf)]@xcite . the system is built on top of the fbsng batch system @xcite developed at fermilab .",
    "the hex farm does not have its own mass storage system .",
    "necessary data either sits in the local disk cache , some data locally created and some transferred from fermilab , or can be accessed from the cdf central data handling system at fermilab directly over the wan .    since the cdf data handling system is evolving@xcite , there are different data delivery and cataloging systems in use , both at the fermilab and at rutgers .",
    "dim is the original light weight cdf data cache system@xcite .",
    "it is natively compatible with cdf software .",
    "central dim running at fermilab accesses the central mass storage .",
    "the central dfc uses an oracle database to store metadata ; the hex farm instance uses msql .",
    "the hex farm instance of dim is not connected to mass storage .",
    "instead it can fetch data from the central data handling system . a very convenient feature of the dim at rutgers is the ability to synchronize a dataset replica with its master copy at fermilab .",
    "it is important because cdf is a running experiment and new data are continuously added to datasets .",
    "datasets interesting to rutgers physicists are set up in such a way that when new files are added to the dataset at fermilab and a user asks to read the dataset , the new files are automatically fetched to rutgers and local metadata are updated accordingly .",
    "dcache@xcite data access is used for data delivery . the data transfer unit in this mode is one fileset , that is about 10 one - gb files .",
    "sam @xcite is a sophisticated baseline data handling solution for the d0 experiment at fermilab .",
    "cdf is currently adopting sam .",
    "this system uses a local data cache and centrally located metadata .",
    "required data are delivered automatically from the closest available source including the central mass storage at fermilab .",
    "sam provides a native mechanism for cataloging and storing in the central mass storage system of new data produced on the local site .",
    "sam is still in trial use by cdf and is installed on several sites including the hex farm .",
    "the sam data cache disks are located on the sam station and exported to worker nodes via nfs .",
    "the caf batch system is used on the hex farm .",
    "user identity is authenticated via kerberos through the collection of collaboration caf systems .",
    "this is the reason that the hex farm head node is attached to the fermilab kerberos domain .",
    "the caf system decouples well data submission , job executing , and output delivery : the job is remotely submitted to the farm , executed there , and output is delivered to the specified remote destination .",
    "this approach provides a good possibility for distributed computing . from user point of view , all caf farms are identical providing user is authorized to submit jobs there .",
    "the same gui can submit the same job to any of the available caf farms .",
    "the following is assumed :    * baseline software is available on the farm * job tarball created on the fly contains all files needed to run in the base environment    this system is naturally extendible for resource broker driven operation .      the hex farm has also installed a prototype of the job and information manager ( jim ) @xcite .",
    "this tool provides resource brokering , job submission , and a monitoring suite .",
    "the system is built on top of condor - g and uses sam information about the availability of data files to select a destination for the job .",
    "jim has an adapter to the local caf submitter and uses ldap based information providers and monitoring tools .",
    "the prototype operation was demonstrated at the sc2002 workshop , the hex farm being one execution site .",
    "both jim and caf have nice monitoring systems .",
    "each one provides complete information about details of the system status , history etc . but",
    "the connection between these monitoring domains was broken when the jim - caf adapter submitted a job to the batch system .",
    "jim operates in terms of a global universal job i d and caf identifies the job by a local i d that is assigned when the job is released to the batch queue .",
    "this problem is general for any grid system submitting jobs to local batch systems that are not `` gridifyed '' .",
    "a database driven solution was selected for jim and is implemented on the hex farm .",
    "figure [ monigraph ] presents the method of monitoring .",
    "the job submitter delivers the sandbox to the grid - batch adapter on the local system .",
    "the adapter submits the job to the local queue and gets back the local i d of the job .",
    "the pair of global job i d and local job i d is put into the database together with ongoing status of the job .",
    "this database record works as a bridge between the global and local system and makes possible the requesting of the status of the local job by global i d .",
    "after the job is completed , the corresponding record may be removed from the database . a simple file based database",
    "was used to prove the principle and improve monitoring tools .",
    "figure [ moni ] demonstrates how information about matching between global and local ids allows a user to follow the local status of a global job .",
    "in summary , the hex farm has a variety of different data access and job submission systems installed .",
    "the farm is involved in essential cdf tests of frontier computing technologies . at the same time",
    "it is operating as a computing facility for a university group .",
    "this is an interesting test that can demonstrate the choice by physicists who are not enthusiastic about new computer technologies and who would rather use these computers to proceed with physics analysis .",
    "experience shows that :    * 80% of data are about 25 static dim datasets resident on the disk ( some replicas of fermilab datasets and some locally created ) .",
    "these data are intensively used for data analysis . * nearly 100% of big jobs",
    "are submitted via the standard caf submitter .",
    "the farm is used for analysis , therefore neither massive data production nor huge monte carlo jobs run there .",
    "static datasets can easily be managed manually in the small community .",
    "although sam data handling is very sophisticated , the dim has been in use by cdf for a long time and is more familiar to people .",
    "our experience is that users prefer simple and reliable solutions . at the same time , simple solutions are usually less scalable and more sophisticated ones become simpler for use when the system grows .",
    "the hex farm already has one and half times more worker nodes and twice more computing power , than at conference time , so massive monte carlo generation can be reasonably performed on site .",
    "new generated data need to be transferred to the central cdf mass storage .",
    "then the automated sam solution becomes faster and simpler with respect to data transfer and cataloging on the central system ; the sam approach will be definitely appreciated by hex farm users .    concluding , in running an analysis farm for the rutgers hep experimental group we contribute to the development and testing of innovative computing technologies deployed for the cdf collaboration and keep innovations tuned for use by the physicists of the group ."
