    "in the most promising cosmological scenarios , structure formation is traced back to the hierarchical growth of primordial gaussian density fluctuations originated from quantum fluctuations ( guth & pi 1982 ; hawking 1982 ; starobinsky 1982 ; bardeen et al .",
    "1986 - hereafter bbks ) . starting from these fluctuations , collapsed , virialized dark matter haloes condensed out . within these haloes gas cools and stars",
    "form ( white & reese 1977 ; white & frenk 1991 ; kauffmann et al . 1999 ) .",
    "so , the structure of dark matter haloes is of fundamental importance in the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies . from the theoretical point of view , the structure of dark matter haloes can be studied both analytically and numerically .",
    "an analytical model that has achieved a wide popularity is the press - schecter ( 1974 ) ( hereafter ps ) formula , which allows one to compute good approximations to the mass function .",
    "ps and bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) gave a detailed description of the ps statistics together with an understanding of its dynamical basis .",
    "in the ps and bond et al ( 1991 ) papers , the authors described how the statistical properties of the initial density field , assumed to be gaussian , together with the spherical collapse model , could be used to derive an estimate of the number density of collapsed dark matter haloes at later times , the so called universal",
    " unconditional \" mass function .",
    "lacey and cole ( 1993 ) , showed how the model could be extended to estimate the merging rate of small objects to form larger ones , thus leading to the possibility of estimating the  conditional \" mass function of sub - haloes within parent haloes .",
    "mo & white ( 1996 ) applied the model to compute an approximation to the spatial clustering of dark haloes .",
    "although the analytical framework of the ps model has been greatly refined and extended ( as testified by the previous cited papers ) , it is well known that the ps mass function , while qualitatively correct , disagrees with the results of n - body simulations . in particular , the ps formula overestimates the abundance of haloes near the characteristic mass @xmath0 and underestimates the abundance in the high mass tail ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ; white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ; lacey & cole 1994 ; tozzi & governato 1998 ; gross et al . 1998 ; governato et al .",
    "the quoted discrepancy is not surprising since the ps model , as any other analytical model , should make several assumptions to get simple analytical predictions . as previously reported , the main assumptions that the ps model combines are the simple physics of the spherical collapse model with the assumption that the initial fluctuations were gaussian and small . on average , initially denser regions collapse before less dense ones , which means that , at any given epoch , there is a critical density , @xmath1 , which must be exceeded if collapse is to occur . in the spherical collapse model ,",
    "this critical density does not depend on the mass of the collapsed object .",
    "taking account of the effects of asphericity and tidal interaction with neighbors , del popolo & gambera ( 1998 ) and sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) ( hereafter smt ) , using a parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse , showed that the threshold is mass dependent , and in particular that of the set of objects that collapse at the same time , the less massive ones must initially have been denser than the more massive , since the less massive ones would have had to hold themselves together against stronger tidal forces . in the second hand",
    ", the gaussian nature of the fluctuation field means that a good approximation to the number density of bound objects that have mass @xmath2 at time @xmath3 is given by considering the barrier crossing statistics of many independent and uncorrelated random walks , where the barrier shape @xmath4 , is connected to the collapse threshold . simply changing the barrier shape",
    ", smt showed that it is possible to incorporate the  quoted effects \" in the excursion set approach .",
    "moreover , using the shape of the modified barrier in the excursion set approach , it is possible to obtain a good fit to the universal halo mass function .",
    "as previously reported , the excursion set approach allows one to calculate good approximations to several important quantities , such as the  unconditional \" and  conditional \" mass functions .",
    "sheth & tormen ( 2002 ) ( hereafter st ) provided formulas to calculate these last quantities starting from the shape of the barrier .",
    "they also showed that while the  unconditional \" and  conditional \" mass function is in good agreement with results from numerical simulations , neither the constant nor the moving barrier models ( barrier obtained from non - spherical collapse ) were able to describe the simulations results at small lookback times , in the case of the rescaled ( in terms of @xmath5 )  conditional \" mass function .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is probably due to the excursion set approach s neglect of correlations between scales ( peacock & heavens 1990 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ; st ) or to the too simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse outlined in smt .    in the present paper ,",
    "i ll use the barrier shape obtained in del popolo & gambera ( 1998 ) , obtained from the parametrization of the nonlinear collapse discussed in that paper , together with the results of st in order to study the  unconditional \" and  conditional \" mass function .",
    "finally , i ll calculate the temperature function for a cdm model by means of the mass functions previously obtained and using an improved version of the m - t relation obtained by voit ( 2000 ) , which accounts for the fact that massive clusters accrete matter quasi - continuously , and consequently that the m - t relation evolves , with time , more modestly than what expected in previous models ( top - hat model ) and taking account of the tidal interaction with neighboring clusters .",
    "the reasons that motivates this study are several : + a ) to study the effects of a barrier different from that used by st on both  unconditional \" and  conditional \" mass function , as proposed even by st ; + b ) to study how well st formulas really do work for several barrier shapes ; + c ) to test if the discrepancies between the temperature function and simulations , observed in several papers ( e.g. governato et al .",
    "1999 ) are reduced using the mass function and the m - t relation obtained .",

    ", i introduce a model for the mass - temperature ( m - t ) relation and calculate the temperature function .",

    "both models show that the threshold for collapse decreases with mass , or similarly it increases with @xmath68 since this quantity is a decreasing function of mass . in other words , this means that , in order to form structure , more massive peaks must cross a lower threshold , @xmath69 , with respect to under - dense ones . at the same time , since the probability to find high peaks is larger in more dense regions , this means that , statistically , in order to form structure , peaks in more dense regions may have a lower value of the threshold , @xmath69 , with respect to those of under - dense regions .",
    "this is due to the fact that less massive objects are more influenced by external tides , and consequently they must be more overdense to collapse by a given time .",
    "in fact , the angular momentum acquired by a shell centred on a peak in the cdm density distribution is anti - correlated with density : high - density peaks acquire less angular momentum than low - density peaks ( hoffman 1986 ; ryden 1988 ) .",
    "a larger amount of angular momentum acquired by low - density peaks ( with respect to the high - density ones ) implies that these peaks can more easily resist gravitational collapse and consequently it is more difficult for them to form structure .",

    "the symbols in fig . 6 do not overlap exactly , at fixed @xmath3 , the conditional mass functions for different parent haloes do not rescale exactly , and",
    "moreover the mass functions at different output times do not rescale either ( the band traced out by symbols at @xmath104 is different from that traced out at @xmath104 ) . in other words ,",
    "the conditional mass function is not a universal function of @xmath5 .",
    "a comparison between the simulations ( symbols ) and the theoretical predictions , ( curves ) , shows that they can provide a good fit only at high redshift ( fig .",
    "6 ( right panel ) ) .",
    "the situation , even if not represented , is similar for the scdm model .",
    "the reasons of the discrepancy should be the following : one possibility is the neglect of correlations between scales ( peacock & heavens 1990 ; bond et al .",
    "1991 ; st ) , the second is that the parametrization of the collapse described in smt is too simple and consequently the collapse threshold and the barrier is also too simple . in the model of this paper",
    "the parametrization of the collapse is slightly different from that of smt . in this paper ,",
    "the spherical collapse is modified to take account of the tidal interaction between protoclusters ( see del popolo & gambera 1998 and the appendix of this paper ) . with the parametrization of this paper the conditional mass function at small",
    "@xmath5 is lower than smt ( at @xmath113 , the difference is @xmath114 ) and the curve gives a better fit of the conditional mass function . at large @xmath5 there is very little difference between the two predictions . so the plots show that changing the barrier shape influences the conditional mass function especially at small lookback times .",
    "however , if the parametrization of the collapse may have a certain role in final shape of the conditional mass function , the role of correlations between scales is surely important especially at small lookback times ( st ) .",
    "in fact the excursion set approach describes in a reasonably good way the clustering at high redshift , but less accurately at small redshifts .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that at large lookback times the largest part of subclumps constitutes a small fraction of the mass of the parent halo .",
    "neglect of correlations between scales introduces a small error since the smoothing scale associated with subclumps is sufficiently different from that of the parent . at smaller lookback times",
    "the situation changes , since subclumps and parent are not so well separated and neglecting the correlations introduces a larger error with respect to the previous case ( st ) . before going on , it is important to stress that the conditional mass functions in the simulations are not yet sufficiently well determined to make strong statements about whether the simulations prefer the smt or the barrier predictions of the present paper .",
    "higher resolution simulations are required to see whether one or the other is more accurate .",
    "finally , i have studied the cumulative temperature function .",
    "the function i obtained and which i am going to describe differs from predictions based upon the ps formula for two reasons : a ) the cluster density is obtained through the excursion set approach but for a non - spherical collapse and a non - constant barrier ; b ) as described in sect .",

    "7 represents the cumulative temperature function for a scdm model ( @xmath120 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath103 ( left panel ) and @xmath131 ( central panel ) ) , and the accretion law for halos of @xmath132 ( right panel ) .",
    "the solid line represents the model of this paper for the temperature function , while the open squares tozzi & governato ( 1998 ) simulations .",
    "the dotted lines the ps prediction with @xmath126 rescaled as done in tozzi & governato ( 1998 ) , to fit the mass function ( @xmath133 ) . from the plots , it is clear that the ps predicts less massive clusters than simulations .",
    "the discrepancy increases with increasing @xmath3 and @xmath134 : at @xmath135 and @xmath103 the discrepancy is less than a factor of 3 while at @xmath135 and @xmath131 , the discrepancy amounts almost to an order of magnitude .",
    "this implies that the cumulative temperature function obtained from simulations evolves more slowly than the ps prediction , in the range of @xmath3 and @xmath134 studied .",
    "the situation becomes worse at larger @xmath3 and @xmath134 .",
    "this means that trying to rule out or accept a cosmological model exclusively on the basis of comparisons between data and the ps formula should be taken with caution . as fig .",
    "7 shows , the corrections introduced by using eq .",

    "as reported in the appendix , the accretion law used in the calculation of the m - t relation is that obtained by v98 following lacey & cole ( 1993 ) prescriptions , namely it is obtained by using the approximation : @xmath136 ( v98 ) , where @xmath137 and @xmath138 is given in v2000 ( see also the appendix ) . as described in the appendix , in the case",
    "the fluctuation amplitudes can be described by a power - law , we have that : @xmath139 simulations by wechsler et al .",

    "the solid line plots eq .",
    "( [ eq : wech ] ) , while the dashed line represents the prediction of v98 , v2000 model .",
    "as shown in the plot , wechsler s prediction is different from v98 , v2000 and then from that of this paper .",
    "the difference is due to the fact that i used ( as in v98 and v2000 ) the extended press - schechter ( eps ) formalism to evaluate the accretion rate , which can reproduce relative properties of the progenitor halo distribution quite well , but has some difficulties in estimating absolute progenitor masses and the overall conditional mass function ( tormen 1998 ; sommerville et al .",
    "2000 ; gardner 2001 ) .",
    "this is one of the reasons that led many authors to propose alternative expressions for the ps mass function ( e.g. , smt , st ) .",
    "however , note that in the calculation of the cumulative temperature function two factors play a role : the expression for the mass function and the m - t relation .",
    "this last introduce a correction of  second order \" in the temperature function when compared with the correction introduced by the new form of mass function used ( see also del popolo & gambera 1999 ) .",
    "in this paper , i calculated the unconditional , conditional mass function and temperature function by using the extension of the excursion set model of st and the barrier shape obtained in del popolo & gambera ( 1988 ) .",
    "i showed that the barrier obtained in del popolo & gambera ( 1998 ) , which takes account of asphericity and tidal interaction between proto - haloes , is a better description of the mass functions and temperature function than the spherical collapse and is in good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "the results are in good agreement with those obtained by st , only some differences are observed expecially at the low mass end .",
    "the main results of the paper can be summarized as follows : + 1 ) the non - constant barrier obtained from the non - spherical collapse in del popolo & gambera ( 1998 ) , taking account of the tidal interaction of proto - clusters with neighboring ones , combined with the st model gives  unconditional \" and  conditional \" mass functions , is in reasonably good agreement with results from numerical cosmological simulations .",
    "+ 2 ) the  unconditional \" and  conditional \" mass functions obtained with the del popolo & gambera ( 1998 ) barrier are slightly different from those obtained by smt and st : smaller values at small and large @xmath5 , with respect to smt and st predictions , and larger values for @xmath141 . in the case of the rescaled  conditional \" mass function",
    "the discrepancy observed by st for small lookback time is smaller in the model of this paper at small @xmath5 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the discrepancy with simulations is connected to smt parametrization of the collapse and not only to the neglect of correlations between scales .",
    "+ 3 ) the mass function in scdm is in good agreement with governato et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and tozzi & governato ( 1998 ) simulations .",
    "+ 4 ) the temperature function calculated by means of the mass functions obtained in the present paper together with an improved version of the m - t relation , and taking account of the tidal interaction with neighboring clusters is in good agreement with the simulations of scdm universes of tozzi & governato ( 1998 ) for different redshifts .",
    "+ 5 ) the st formulae really do work for different barrier shapes ( at least that used in this paper , that introduced in smt and that of monaco ( 1997a , b ) ) .",
    "+ 6 ) the behavior of the  unconditional \" mass function at small masses is similar to that of sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) , st , and very different from that proposed by jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see st fig . 13 ) .",
    "the above considerations show that it is possible to get accurate predictions for a number of statistical quantities associated with the formation and clustering of dark matter haloes by incorporating a non - spherical collapse in the excursion set approach .",
    "the improvement is probably connected also to the fact that incorporating the non - spherical collapse with increasing barrier in the excursion set approach results in a model in which fragmentation and mergers may occur , effects important in structure formation .",

    "from the simulations and observations , we know that the mass within a specified density contrast is straightforwardly related to temperature . two fundamental steps in obtaining the m - t relation",
    "are : a ) to approximate cluster formation with the evolution of a spherical top - hat perturbation ( e.g. , peebles 1993 ) ; b ) to assume that each cluster we see at a given redshift @xmath3 has just reached the moment of virialization , an assumption known as the late - formation approximation , then @xmath143",

    "the late - formation approximation is a good one for many purposes , but a better one can be obtained in the low-@xmath144 limit . as can be found in the literature , there are two ways of improving the quoted model .",
    "one is to define a formation redshift @xmath145 at which a cluster virializes and after the properties of observed clusters at @xmath3 are obtained by integrating over the appropriate distribution of formation redshifts ( kitayama & suto 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ) .",
    "the second possibility is that described by v98 , v2000 . in this approach , the top - hat cluster formation model is substituted by a model of cluster formation from spherically symmetric perturbations with negative radial density gradients .",
    "the fact that clusters form gradually , and not instantaneously , is taken into account in the merging - halo formalism of lacey & cole ( 1993 ) .",
