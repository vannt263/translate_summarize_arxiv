    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) form a small , but rapidly expanding , class of isolated neutron star ( ns ) sources characterized by the emission of short ( @xmath5  s ) , energetic ( @xmath6 ) bursts of x - rays .",
    "their persistent luminosity ( @xmath7@xmath8  in the @xmath910 kev range ) is often variable , with flux enhancements up to several hundreds during the outburst phases of transient sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the large values of the magnetic field derived from the standard dipole formula ( @xmath17 ) , the lack of detected stellar companions and their large x - ray output as compared to @xmath18 led to the suggestion that sgrs and axps are powered by a young ( age @xmath19@xmath20 yr ) , ultra - magnetized neutron star , or magnetar @xcite . indeed , the magnetar scenario has been largely successful in explaining many of the observed properties of sgrs / axps , including those of the bursts @xcite and of the persistent emission ( the twisted magnetosphere model , * ? ? ?",

    "this , actually , reflects the original definition of a magnetar as a ns which is powered by its ( large ) magnetic field @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "a super - strong magnetic field is not per se a sufficient condition for triggering sgr / axp - like activity , as testified by the existence of ns sources , for instance most of the so - called high - b radio pulsars ( hbpsrs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this suggests that magnetic energy substantially contributes to their emission at certain stages .",
    "the magnetic field inferred from their rotation properties ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) is , in fact , close to that of sgrs / axps , contributing to the widespread belief that magnetar - like activity has to be associated to super - strong magnetic fields , typically higher than the quantum field @xmath24 .    in this respect ,",

    "a crucial point is whether a ns with a surface field well below @xmath30  g , can harbor an internal toroidal magnetic field strong enough to produce crustal displacements , which are believed to be responsible for the bursting / outbursting episodes in sgrs / axps @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address this issue and discuss both the spectral and timing properties of in the framework of an aging magnetar .",
    "the suggestion that  may be an aged magnetar was already put forward by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) on the basis of the low persistent luminosity ( most likely well below that observed during the outburst decay , @xmath31 ) , weak bursting activity ( only two faint bursts were recorded , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite estimated that an internal toroidal field @xmath33  g is required to power the persistent emission over a source lifetime @xmath34 , and concluded that @xmath35 can be still large enough to overcome the crustal yield .",
    "the main appeal of the `` old magnetar '' scenario is that it can offer an interpretation of the observed properties of  within an already established framework , validating the magnetar model also for ( surface ) field strengths quite far away from those of canonical sgrs / axps .",
    "however intriguing , the considerations presented by @xcite necessary rely on quite crude estimates .",
    "a more thorough investigation on the behaviour of evolved magnetars , in which a substantial decay of the magnetic field occurred , is definitely in order before claiming that  is indeed powered by the last hiccups of an once ultra - magnetized ns .    in the following we focus on three points which we deem central in order to test the `` old magnetar '' hypothesis .",
    "first , assuming that  was born with a magnetar - like surface field , @xmath36 must have decayed by a factor @xmath37 to match the current upper limit .",
    "roughly the same reduction is expected in the internal field . although the latter can initially be @xmath38100 times higher than @xmath36 ( at least locally )",
    ", one may wonder if at late times internal magnetic stresses are still strong enough to crack the crust .",
    "a second and related question is if realistic models of field decay in magnetars can account for the observed rotational properties ( period and period derivative ) of .",
    "this also directly bears to the true age of the source which is most probably much younger than the characteristic age , estimated assuming a non - decaying field .",
    "a final point concerns the persistent emission of .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations show evidence for a two component thermal spectrum ( similar to those observed in other transient magnetars ) , although the presence of a non - thermal tail can not be excluded ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see  [ persistent ] ) . in the magnetar model ,",
    "spectra are expected to exhibit a power - law tail which originates from resonant scattering in a twisted magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "however , no calculations have been performed yet in the range of surface fields implied by .",
    "a major issue in establishing the magnetic evolution of nss ( and of magnetars in particular ) is that observations place very little , if any , constraint on the structure and strength of the internal magnetic field . while there are several indications that the large - scale , external field can be reasonably assumed to be dipolar , with a moderate amount of twist in magnetars , the different mechanisms proposed for the generation of the internal field in the earlier phases of the ns life ( differential rotation , dynamo , magneto - rotational instability ) most likely give rise to both toroidal and poloidal components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of a toroidal field , roughly in equipartition with the poloidal one , is also required by general stability arguments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a further complication comes from the present poor knowledge of where the internal field resides .",
    "the field can either permeate the entire star ( `` core '' fields ) , or be mostly confined in the crust ( `` crustal '' fields ) , depending on where its supporting ( super)currents are located .",
    "the highly anisotropic surface temperature distribution required in some xdinss has been taken as observational evidence in favor of a complex field geometry in the external layers ( crust , envelope , atmosphere ) of nss , either in the form of strong crustal toroidal fields , multipolar poloidal components , or both @xcite .    the more general configuration for the internal field in a ns",
    "will then be that produced by the superposition of current systems in the core and the crust . as stressed by @xcite ,",
    "the relative contribution of the core / crustal fields is likely different in different types of nss .",
    "in old radio pulsars , where no field decay is observed , the long - lived core component may dominate , while a sizeable , more volatile crustal field is probably present in magnetars , for which substantial field decay over a timescale @xmath39@xmath40 yr is expected ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a particularly important result @xcite is the lesser role that ambipolar diffusion plays in magnetar cores ( after crystallization , the absence of convective motions already quenched ambipolar diffusion in the crust ) on their active lifetimes , contradicting an assumption often made in the modelling of the flaring activity .",
    "therefore , if the decay / evolution of the magnetic field is indeed the cause of magnetar activity , it is likely to take place outside the core and will be governed by hall / ohmic diffusion in the stellar crust .",
    "the relative importance of these two mechanism is strongly density- and temperature- dependent .",
    "thus , any self - consistent study of the magnetic field evolution must be coupled to a detailed modelling of the neutron star thermal evolution , and conversely .",
    "other mechanisms , e.g. flux expulsion from the superconducting core , due to the interaction between neutron vortices and magnetic flux tubes , are highly uncertain and very difficult to model . for these reasons , recent investigations of the magnetic field evolution in magnetars focused only on the crustal component of the field .",
    "the first attempts in this direction used a split approach .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of the field by solving the complete induction equation in an isothermal crust , but assuming a prescribed time dependence for the temperature .",
    "they found that crustal magnetic fields in nss suffer significant decay during the first @xmath41  yr and that the hall drift , although inherently conservative ( i.e. alone it can not dissipate magnetic energy ) , plays an important role since it may reorganize the field from the larger to the smaller ( spatial ) scales where ohmic dissipation proceeds faster .",
    "the cooling of magnetized nss with field decay was investigated by @xcite by adopting a simple , analytical law for the time variation of the field which incorporates the main features of the ohmic and hall terms in the induction equation .",
    "the fully coupled magneto - thermal evolution of a ns was finally addressed by @xcite , including all realistic microphysics . however , owing to numerical difficulties in treating the hall term , their models include only ohmic diffusion .",
    "this can be a limitation because , as they note , the hall drift likely drastically affects the very early evolution of ultra - magnetized nss with surface field @xmath42  g , and also that of `` normal '' nss at late times ( @xmath43  yr ) , when the temperature in the crust has dropped .",
    "on the other hand , for initial values of @xmath44  g , still well within the magnetar range , the effect of the hall drift is expected to introduce at most quantitative changes ( a somewhat faster dissipation ) with respect to the purely ohmic picture .      to explore if , and",
    "to which extent , the magneto - thermal evolution of ( initially ) highly magnetic nss can lead to objects with properties compatible with those of , we performed some runs using the code of @xcite .",
    "we refer to section 2 in @xcite and section 4 of @xcite for all details about the code and the microphysical input .",
    "we evolved a @xmath45 ns assuming the minimal cooling scenario @xcite , with no exotic phases nor fast neutrino cooling processes , but including enhanced neutrino emission from the breaking and formation of neutron cooper pairs in the ns core , as recent observations of the cassiopeia a supernova remnant seem to require @xcite .",
    "the initial period was fixed at 10 ms and the initial dipole field to @xmath46 g. note that the internal poloidal field is actually higher , with a maximum value @xmath47 g in the inner crust .",
    "we considered three models with different values of the ( maximum ) internal toroidal field , @xmath48 and @xmath49 g , which turns out to be the crucial parameter , as shown in figure [ mag - rot - evol ] .",
    "the four panels illustrate the evolution of luminosity , dipole field @xmath36 , period @xmath50 and period derivative @xmath0 .",
    "indeed the properties of are recovered in the case of @xmath51 g and age @xmath52 yr .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\i ) the low quiescent luminosity is easily explained considering that the object is relatively old : even a ns born as a bright , hot magnetar becomes cool and dim at this age .",
    "\\ii ) on the other hand , the observed period constrains the dipolar field : the initial dipole field can not be much higher that the one considered here in order to prevent the star from spinning - down too fast and reach periods longer than that observed at present .",
    "obviously there are other large uncertainties , such as the angle between rotation and magnetic axis , that may reduce the period ( we assumed an orthogonal rotator here ) .",
    "\\iii ) although the components of the initial internal field @xmath53 can be varied to some extent , a quite large value is required .",
    "a large toroidal field , in fact , implies strong currents , which , in turn , produce more heating and higher temperatures .",
    "this drives a faster global field decay , which makes it possible to match the observed upper limit on @xmath0 and @xmath36 .",
    "we stress that , while there are no stringent arguments against such large internal fields in the ns crust , their real occurrence in magnetars is an open issue .",
    "a possibility is that if the hall drift becomes very important and it results in much faster dissipation , then one can obtain the same results starting with lower initial toroidal fields .",
    "finally , we note that the hall term is bound to become important again for objects like  at late stages ( @xmath54 myr ) as the star cools down and the conductivity increases by several orders of magnitude .",
    "no calculations are available in this regime but the possible occurrence of a second `` hall - active '' phase could lead to enhanced bursting activity and rapid field decay .",
    "this may be an indication that the estimate of the bursting rate in @xcite is a lower limit .",
    "very recently @xcite used the magnetic evolution code of @xcite together with the cooling models by @xcite to compute the magnetic stress acting on the ns crust at different times .",
    "their baseline model has @xmath55  g and @xmath56  g. they found that the occurrence of crustal fractures ( and hence of bursts ) is not restricted to the early ns life , during which the surface field is ultra - strong , but can extend to late phases ( age @xmath57@xmath58  yr ; see their figure 2 ) .",
    "both the energetics and the recurrence time of the events evolve as the star ages . for `` old '' magnetars about @xmath59 crustal fractures release @xmath60  erg and",
    "the waiting time between two successive events is @xmath6110  yr .",
    "they also made a longer run with a model with @xmath62  g and @xmath56  g , for which the event rate is about a factor 10 smaller .",
    "the model we considered in  [ magevol ] as representative of  has @xmath63 very close to this latter configuration , while @xmath53 is larger .",
    "the present ( maximum ) value of the internal toroidal field is @xmath64 and , although we did not perform any detailed simulations , we argue that the bursting rate of our model , at its present age , is similar to the second model of @xcite , because the internal configuration of the magnetic field is similar .",
    "it is important to notice that , despite the much larger initial toroidal fields of the model presented in this paper , this leads to faster decay and therefore similar values are reached when the ns is a million years old .",
    "comparing both models at the estimated age of 1.5 myr , the internal toroidal field of the model presented in this paper is only twice larger than that discussed in @xcite , and we estimate the typical lapse time between events for an object like   is @xmath6550 years .      in order to investigate the spectral properties of the persistent emission from  and its time evolution , we analyzed eight _ swift _ xrt and one _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic spectra ( see table s1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "preliminary results for some of these datasets were already reported in @xcite .",
    "spectra for all the epochs were fitted simultaneously using xspec v.12.6 , with the value of the column density @xmath66 tied within the different observations .",
    "several one- and two - component models were tried , including a single blackbody , a one - dimensional ( rcs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a three - dimensional ( ntz , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) resonant scattering model , a double blackbody and a blackbody plus power - law .",
    "all single component models give rather poor fits . while for the rcs and ntz models the residuals and the @xmath67 values",
    "were not acceptable , a single bb decomposition properly reproduces all the data but the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum , which is the only responsible for the relatively large @xmath67 of the simultaneous fit . since the highest - quality available spectrum argues against the source having ( at least at the early stage of the outburst ) a single thermal spectrum , we decided to add a second component to the multi - instrument fit .",
    "a bb+bb and a bb+pl model with all parameters free ( except @xmath66 , see above ) provide acceptable fits of comparable quality ( @xmath68 for 601 dof and @xmath69 for 601 dof , respectively ) .",
    "however , we stress again that both these spectral representations contain a large number ( 32 in total ) of free parameters , and those associated to the second component are not required by the seven _ swift _ observations but only by the _ xmm - newton _ one . moreover , despite on a statistical ground there is no reason to prefer the bb+bb over the bb+pl model , we note that in the latter : i ) the spectral index @xmath70 changes dramatically and in a totally erratic way from one observation to another , and ii ) @xmath70 can be as large as @xmath71 , arguing against a power - law as a physically - motivated representation of the second spectral component . on the other hand , the values of the spectral parameters in the bb+bb model",
    "appear to be reasonable and their time evolution is monotonic ( see below ) .",
    "since in the bb+bb best fit model the temperature and normalization of the colder bb component appear not to vary sensibly in time ( again , possibly because they are poorly constrained by the _ swift _",
    "observations ) , we performed a fit with these two parameters tied across the various datasets .",
    "this resulted in a similarly good fit ( @xmath72 for 617 dof ) and has the advantage to contain 16 degrees of freedom less . in the case of the bb+pl model",
    "the goodness - of - the - fit worsens considerably ( @xmath73 for 617 dof ) by requiring that the parameters of the ( single ) bb are the same at the different epochs .    for these reasons , in the following we take the bb+bb model ( with the colder bb constant in time ) as the most likely representation of the data , and",
    "discuss the ensuing implications in framework of an evolved magnetar .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the failure of the resonant scattering models to fit the data may be due to the fact that both rcs and ntz were originally developed for much higher fields than that likely present in  ( the ntz version used here assumes @xmath74 g )",
    ". a more detailed spectral analysis will be the subject of a forthcoming paper ( rea et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the picture which emerges from the spectral analysis is that of thermal emission from two regions on the star surface , a cold one , with more or less constant size and temperature ( @xmath75  km for a fiducial distance @xmath76  kpc and @xmath77 kev ) , and a hot one , which shrinks during the outburst decay .",
    "the evolution of the temperature and size of the two components is shown in figure  [ parevol ] .",
    "the temperature of the hot region is more or less constant at @xmath78 and its area changes from @xmath79 to @xmath80 times that of the cold region ( @xmath810.30  km , again for @xmath76  kpc ) .",
    "the overall behavior is quite reminiscent of those seen in other transient magnetar sources , notably the axps xte j1810 - 197 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    .",
    "time is counted in days from the outburst onset , on 2009 - 06 - 05 20:38:24.000 utc ( mjd 54987.862 ) .",
    "[ parevol],width=326 ]    within the magnetar model this is interpreted as due to the sudden development of a twist in the external magnetic field which then progressively decays .",
    "the twist likely affects only a limited bundle of ( closed ) field lines and the charges flowing along the current - carrying bundle heat the surface layers as they impact upon the star .",
    "when the magnetosphere untwists , the size of the heated region decreases @xcite .",
    "this picture is compatible with the results we obtained for  with the bb+bb model assuming that the heated region corresponds to the area emitting the hotter bb .",
    "this is superimposed ( or close ) to a cooler , larger cap which is responsible for the emission of the softer bb .",
    "it is interesting to note that the analysis of the pulse profiles during the first stages of the outburst supports this view .",
    "the double - peaked pulse profile of  suggests , in fact , that the surface thermal map of the star comprises two warm caps , only one of which was involved in the heating process @xcite .",
    "the predicted characteristic time for the outburst evolution is @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the discharge voltage and @xmath84 is the area of the surface region involved by the twist @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath85 rad and @xmath86 , we get for the characteristic time @xmath87 . a low discharge voltage , @xmath88 , is then required to obtain a decay time @xmath89 a few months .",
    "we warn that , as already noted by @xcite , the luminosity produced by ohmic dissipation appears to be too low to reproduce that observed at the beginning of the outburst , @xmath90",
    ". however , if the twist affected a region different from a polar cap ( e.g. a ring confined between two values @xmath91 and @xmath92 of the magnetic colatitude ) the value of the luminosity can be higher . alternatively , other heating mechanisms may be operating , e.g. the release of magnetic energy in the star outer layers @xcite .    as discussed in section [ bursts ] , the internal field of can be still large enough to produce crustal displacements so that magnetic helicity is transferred to the external field , twisting up the magnetosphere .",
    "the appearance of a twist is usually accompanied by the formation of a high - energy spectral tail , due to resonant cyclotron up - scattering of thermal surface photons , which is , however , not unambiguously detected in . in order to investigate the properties of resonant cyclotron scattering spectra in the low - field regime ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "we run a series of 3d montecarlo simulations , using the relativistic transport code of @xcite , to which we refer for all details .",
    "we considered four values of the ( polar ) surface field ( @xmath94 ) , two values of the seed photon temperature ( @xmath95 ) and several values of the twist angle in the range @xmath96 .",
    "the electron temperature and bulk velocity were fixed to @xmath97 and @xmath98 in all cases .",
    "a different choice of these parameters produce similar results provided that the scattering particles are mildly relativistic , as indeed required to reproduce the observed 110 kev spectra of sgrs / axps ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "results are summarized in figure [ gamma ] which shows the photon index of the non - thermal tail ( computed in the 68 kev range ) as a function of the twist angle for the different values of @xmath36 .",
    "the ( average ) index ( in the same energy range ) of the blackbody spectrum is marked by a dashed horizontal line : when the photon index approaches the line the spectrum becomes indistinguishable from a blackbody and no tail is present .",
    "as it can be seen , while for @xmath99 kev a non - thermal tail below 10 kev appears for all the values of the twist , unless @xmath100 g and @xmath101 rad , the up - scattering of seed photons associated to the hotter component only produces a tail if @xmath102 rad and @xmath103  g. we stress that here we are considering photon energies below 10 kev , so the lack of a non - thermal spectral component for @xmath104 kev only reflects the fact that now resonant comptonization tends to move photons at energies higher than 10 kev . a tail , in fact , may be present above 10 kev also if it does not show up below 10 kev .",
    "although the resonant scattering spectrum produced by the reprocessing of soft photons coming from two ns surface regions at different temperature is not exactly given by the superposition of the two individual models ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we adopt this approach to get some insight into the spectral properties of . if the observed spectrum of the source is best modelled in terms of the superposition of two blackbodies with @xmath105 kev the twist angle must be @xmath106  rad for @xmath107 not to produce a power - law tail in the hot component ( see figure [ gamma ] ) .",
    "this , however , is only a necessary condition because a pl tail may still appear in the cold component .",
    "the emergence of such a power - law is related to the relative magnitude of the hot and cold components .",
    "the total spectrum resulting from the superposition of the models with @xmath108 and 0.9 kev is shown in figure [ spec ] for @xmath109 g and two values of the ratio of the emitting areas , @xmath110 , typical of those measured during the evolution of .",
    "we remark that the largest area ratio ( @xmath111 ) corresponds to the most unfavorable case : if the tail does not appear now it is not present for smaller values of the area ratio , when the cold component contributes less . as it is seen , the total spectrum is very close to the superposition of two blackbodies , with no high - energy tail .",
    "the same result holds for different values of the magnetic field , provided that @xmath112 rad , and for even larger values of the twist if the field is as low as @xmath113 g. we conclude that the strong evidence that  exhibits a x - ray spectrum dominated by surface thermal emission below 10 kev is not in contradiction with the predictions of rcs models .        ,",

    "it is actually possible that the external magnetic field in nss , and in sgrs / axps in particular , is more complex than a simple dipole .",

    "the predicted quiescent luminosity at the same age is @xmath134 , again in agreement with the current luminosity of the source , the faintest measured so far and possibly close to the quiescent value ( @xmath135  for a distance of 2 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note in this respect that the luminosity drops very quickly for ages @xmath43 yr ( top left panel of figure [ mag - rot - evol ] ) , so the present value could well be below @xmath136  if the age is only slightly above 1.5 myr .",
    "a somehow longer age would have negligible impact on the predicted @xmath50 , @xmath0 and @xmath36 which already reached a nearly constant value ( see again figure [ mag - rot - evol ] ) .",
    "we also note that the measured flux in the @xmath910 kev band may not be representative of the bolometric luminosity for an old object like",
    ". if the ns surface temperature is @xmath137 k , in fact , the quiescent thermal emission would be too soft ( and absorbed ) to be clearly detectable .",
    "it is then possible that the observed x - ray flux only constrains the `` outburst '' luminosity and the genuine quiescent emission may go undetected even if it is @xmath138 .",
    "given the large internal toroidal field at birth , our fiducial model for  retains the capability to induce crustal fractures , and hence to produce bursts , even at quite late times .",
    "a comparison of our model with one of the cases investigated in detail by @xcite at a comparable age ( @xmath139 myr ) , indicates that the recurrence time between bursting / outbursting events for an object like  is a few tens of years .",
    "crustal displacements are accompanied by a twisting up of the magnetosphere and the formation of a high - energy spectral tail , which is observed in most sgrs / axps .",
    "we have shown , however , that a source with a spectral distribution consistent with a double blackbody , as follows from the analysis of a series of x - ray observations taken during the outburst decay of , can be modelled as well by a resonant cyclotron scattering model if the twist is moderate ( twist angle @xmath106 rad ) and the surface field is low , @xmath140 , as predicted by our evolutionary calculations .    it has been already noticed that the sgrs / axps which exhibit the larger flux variations seem to be those with the lower dipole fields @xcite .  provides a further case for such a correlation .",
    "in the magnetar scenario the occurrence and energetics of outbursts are dictated by the internal field and the peak luminosity @xmath141 depends on the ( maximum ) energy stored locally prior to the event .",
    "@xmath141 is not much sensitive to the external dipole field .",
    "if the energy released in an event is roughly similar in all sources ( as in the case the mechanism is gated e.g. by the crustal yield ) , the ratio between the peak and persistent fluxes has to be much higher in the less active , old objects than in active , young ones .",
    "this is because @xmath141 is similar for all of them , but the quiescent luminosity is much lower for old sources . in the latter ,",
    "field decay had the time to reduce the dipole field to rather low values , so old , low - field objects ( but with a sufficiently high internal field ) appear as transient sources .",
    "it is intriguing that  is the source with the lowest field known and at the same time a most extreme transient , with a peak - to - persistent flux ratio @xmath142 .",
