    "in thermal field theory , in order to deal with the infrared singularities which occur at finite temperature , it is necessary to put thermal masses into the zeroth order of a resummed perturbation theory . to this end",
    ", one must first calculate the hard thermal loops , where all the external energies and momenta are much smaller than the temperature @xmath0 .",
    "these loops yield gauge - invariant contributions , which are in general non - local functionals of the external fields @xcite . however , there are two special cases : the static and the long wave - length limits , when the hard thermal amplitudes become local functions , which are independent of the external energies and momenta @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these two limits give different functions @xcite . of special interest",
    "is the evaluation in the above limits of causal thermal self - energy functions , which determine the high - temperature behavior of screening lengths and plasma frequencies @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to derive a simple method for calculating the leading contributions of retarded thermal loops in static external bosonic fields .",
    "we will show that these contributions can be directly obtained by evaluating the hard thermal loops at zero external energies and momenta .",
    "this result has been previously derived in gauge theories at one - loop level @xcite and verified by explicit calculations at two - loops @xcite . here , we present an argument which is valid to all orders in thermal perturbation theory .    the above result may be more readily understood in the analytically continued imaginary - time formalism @xcite which is well suited for the study of retarded green s functions @xcite .",
    "this formalism of thermal field theory defines the bosonic green s functions at integral values of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy of the @xmath3-th external particle . after performing the sums over the integral values ( half - integral for fermions ) of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the energy of the @xmath6-th internal particle , one arrives at bosonic ( fermionic ) thermal distribution functions of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is some linear combination of external energies and",
    "@xmath9 is some combination of external and internal momenta .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that if one would now analytically continue the external energies , one would get an analytic behavior when all @xmath10 and @xmath11 become small , leading to a well defined result in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "however , the analytic continuation constructed in this manner would yield , after performing the integrations over internal momenta , factors like @xmath13 which are exponentially increasing for large values of @xmath14 .",
    "the proper procedure which avoids the appearance of such factors makes use of the relation @xmath15 which is valid before analytic continuation , since then , @xmath16 is an integer .    in this way , the green s functions will be well behaved when @xmath2 are analytically continued to complex values , and various limits approaching the real axis from different directions may be taken .",
    "but this procedure , in contrast to the previous one , introduces non - analyticities in the thermal loops when @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "nevertheless , the leading contributions of hard thermal loops in the static case @xmath19 , @xmath20 , still agree with those obtained by setting directly in the loops all external energies and momenta @xmath21 .",
    "this agreement occurs only in the static limit which entails that @xmath22 , since then the condition reduces to an identity .",
    "thus , in the static case , analytic continuation preserves the form of the original thermal distribution functions , which lead to an analytic behavior when all @xmath18 .    we will first exemplify the above argument in the case of a two - loop thermal amplitude .",
    "next , we shall present a more general approach , based on a spectral representation of the thermal green s functions @xcite , which allows to verify this argument to all orders .",
    "let us consider , for example , a two - loop diagram in the scalar @xmath23 theory , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the result for the one - loop sub - diagram in the renormalizable six - dimensional theory may be written in the @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a polynomial of degree @xmath26 in @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( when @xmath29 , there appear additional logarithmic terms ) and @xmath30 is given by    @xmath31-\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 } \\log \\frac{t}{\\mu } \\right\\},\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is a renormalization mass scale .",
    "the above one - loop result for @xmath30 has branch points at @xmath33 . when this term is inserted in the two - loop graph of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , these branch points coincide with the poles at @xmath33 which arise from the other terms in this diagram .",
    "therefore , in order to perform the @xmath27 integration in a well defined manner , it is necessary to regularize @xmath34 , which we do using dimensional regularization in @xmath35 dimensions .",
    "this leads to the regularized form of @xmath30 given by    @xmath36-\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2 } \\log \\frac{t}{\\mu}\\right\\},\\ ] ]    which reduces to eq . in the limit @xmath37 . in eq .",
    ", @xmath38 denotes the angle between the momenta @xmath39 and @xmath40 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and @xmath41 denote terms which are well behaved at @xmath33 . using this result in the two - loop graph of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and performing the sum over the integral values of @xmath42 by contour integration , we obtain a leading thermal contribution of the form @xmath43\\ ] ]    where the anticlockwise contour @xmath44 , along the imaginary @xmath27-axis , is closed in the right half @xmath27 plane .",
    "evaluating the @xmath27-integral in terms of the poles inside @xmath44 , and using the fact that the leading contribution from the pole at @xmath45 in @xmath46 vanishes , leads to the result ( @xmath47 )    @xmath48.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this point , we note that if one would analytically continue to complex values of @xmath8 , one would obtain an expression which is analytic as @xmath49 , with the limit @xmath50^\\prime_{p_0=p } - \\frac{n(p ) \\pi_t(p , p,\\epsilon)}{p}\\right\\ }   , \\ ] ]    where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "however , for the reasons mentioned previously , one must first use in the relation @xmath51 and then make the analytic continuation of @xmath8 .",
    "this procedure will introduce a non - analyticity when @xmath49 . to study this",
    ", we remark that the leading contribution in @xmath0 of the @xmath28-integral in comes from the region where @xmath52 .",
    "thus , in order to find the high - temperature behavior of the hard thermal loop , one may assume that @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "then , it is easy to see that the leading contribution obtained in the static limit agrees with the result given in @xmath55 on the other hand , the leading contributions in the long wave - length limit would lead to a different result , namely    @xmath56.\\ ] ]    let us now evaluate the leading static thermal contribution which arises from . in this case",
    ", there appear individual terms proportional to @xmath57 which exhibit a collinear singularity in the region where @xmath58 , with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being nearly parallel ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , such collinear singularities turn out to cancel so that in the present case , it is not necessary to resort to the kln mechanism at finite temperature @xcite . using eqs . and , together with the relations @xmath59 one then gets a leading @xmath60 contribution of the form @xmath61",
    "in order to verify to all orders that the leading static contributions agree with the result obtained by setting directly , in the self - energy , the external energy - momentum equal to zero , it is convenient to use a spectral representation of the analytically continued bosonic self - energy ( see , for example , chapter 3 in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one then obtains for the analytic retarded self - energy the spectral form @xmath62 where @xmath8 is a real energy and , for simplicity , only the energy - momentum dependence has been written explicitly . here",
    ", the spectral density @xmath63 is related to the discontinuity of @xmath64 across the real axis and the second term approaches zero when @xmath65 .",
    "these features can be easily seen at one - loop in the scalar @xmath66 model , where @xmath67 and    @xmath68.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath69 and the free spectral density @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the ordinary mass of the scalar particles .",
    "one can check that , by substituting into and performing the @xmath73 integration , one gets the one - loop thermal contribution    @xmath74 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath75 is to be understood and we have neglected @xmath72 with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "this agrees with the result obtained from by setting @xmath76 and employing the relation .",
    "evaluating in the static and long wavelength limits , leads to distinct terms of order @xmath77 .    using the spectral representation , where we take for definiteness @xmath78",
    ", we now consider the leading thermal contributions which arise in the long wave - length and static limits of the retarded self - energy @xmath79 @xmath80 next , let us compare these contributions with the result obtained by setting directly @xmath22 , @xmath81 in the retarded thermal self - energy function @xmath82 since the integrand in @xmath83 is not a uniformly continous function of @xmath8 , we can not take the limit @xmath84 inside the integral .",
    "thus , we infer that the leading thermal contribution got in the long wave - length limit , would generally differ from the result given in .",
    "on the other hand , we will argue that in the static case , the limit @xmath85 can be taken inside the integral . to this end , using the fact that @xmath86 is an odd function of @xmath73 , it is convenient to write in the alternative form ( where @xmath87 denotes the principal value ) @xmath88 consider now the integral @xmath89 it is well known that if @xmath90 converges uniformly , then the limit @xmath85 can be taken inside the integral .",
    "such a convergence may be shown by considering the physical meaning of @xmath86 , which gives the imaginary part of the retarded self - energy .",
    "it yields the rates of processes occurring in a thermal plasma , such as particle creation / annihilation or scattering , in the presence of an external field @xcite . at high temperatures , such that",
    "@xmath91 , the leading contributions to these rates have a smooth behavior when @xmath85 , in which case @xmath86 would be a well behaved function in this limit .",
    "furthermore , in consequence of unitarity ( conservation of probability ) such rates should decrease at large values of the energy @xmath73 .",
    "assuming , for example , that @xmath86 behaves for large @xmath73 like @xmath92 , where @xmath44 is a positive constant ( which is consistent with ) , one gets @xmath93 for every @xmath94 , provided @xmath95 is sufficiently large .",
    "a similar condition is obtained also for more general forms of the spectral density at large @xmath73 , which lead to a @xmath77 behaviour of the self - energy at high temperatures .",
    "thus , @xmath90 will be uniformly convergent so that the limit @xmath85 can be taken inside and , therefore , inside the integral @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , it follows that the leading static contribution will agree to all orders with the result , got by calculating @xmath97 at vanishing energy and momentum .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the two - loop results given in eqs . and .",
    "according to the simple arguments given following eqs . and , the above result should hold as well in the case of higher point functions .",
    "we will now derive this property for the @xmath98-point green s functions , using a treatment which generalizes the previous method .",
    "the spectral representation of the retarded @xmath98-point functions calculated in the imaginary time formalism may be written in the form @xcite      where @xmath2 are real energy variables and @xmath100 . setting in , for example ,",
    "@xmath101 positive and all other epsilons negative such that @xmath102 , defines the analytic @xmath6-th retarded function .",
    "the spectral densities are the difference of two thermal wightman functions which , in the case of pure bosonic fields , are given by        one may now consider the leading thermal contributions which arise from in the static limit ( when all @xmath106 ) which is well defined due to the analyticity properties of @xmath107 . in this case , to leading order in @xmath0 , one may next take the limits @xmath108 and proceed similarly to the previous analysis .",
    "we then find a result which agrees with that obtained by setting in all external energies and momenta equal to zero :      we have explicitly verified this relation at two - loops order , by calculating the leading static thermal contributions of the three - point functions in gauge theories .",
    "thus , we conclude that to all orders in the static limit , the leading thermal contributions of retarded bosonic green s functions may be directly obtained by evaluating them at zero external energies and momenta ."
