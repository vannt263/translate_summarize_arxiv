    "however , even the simplest correlated networks with only pair correlations between the nearest - neighbor degrees are still poorly understood . our aim is to find when the critical singularities for correlated networks of this kind coincide with those for well - studied uncorrelated networks and when and how much they differ . at the present time",

    "are characterized by model dependent critical exponents which differ from the standard mean - field ones and the critical exponents of two and three dimensional lattices , see , for example , refs .",
    "the critical behavior depends on an asymptotic behavior of a degree distribution at large degrees . for percolation on an uncorrelated complex network that was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "one should expect , however , that for dynamical processes taking place in a complex networks , correlations are important .",
    "the simplest particular kind of correlations in a networks are correlations between degrees of two nearest neighbors in a network  so called degree  degree correlations . in this work",
