    "the distance and proper motion are fundamental and important pulsar parameters .",
    "a model - independent distance and proper motion measurement is especially important for millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "firstly , msps are old enough to leave the galactic disk .",
    "model - independent pulsar distance measurements indicate that the tc93 @xcite or ne2001 @xcite galactic electron density distribution model underestimates the distances for high - latitude pulsars @xcite . secondly , the distance and proper motion of a pulsar are also important parameters in the pulsar timing observation . in the shklovskii effect ,",
    "for example , a transverse component of this pulsar velocity gives rise to an appreciable increase in the apparent period even if the pulsar is not slowing down @xcite .",
    "for msps , @xmath8 is @xmath9  s / s , comparable to their observed first order period derivative .",
    "furthermore , msps have more parameters to fit in timing observations , as most of them have companions .",
    "if the distance and proper motion have been obtained independently , it will be helpful for the other parameters fitting .",
    "high precision vlbi astrometry offers a powerful way to directly measure the parallaxes and proper motions of pulsars . with the steady progress of vlbi observation , correlation and data",
    "processing techniques , vlbi astrometry of some pulsars has been accomplished successfully @xcite .    here , we report the progress of our astrometry project on two msps , psr  b1257 + 12 and psr  j1022 + 1001 , with the vlba and evn .",
    "psr  b1257 + 12 is the first extra - solar planetary system discovered .",
    "it has been confirmed that psr  b1257 + 12 has three planets in approximately co - planar orbits @xcite .",
    "psr  j1022 + 1001 is an intermediate mass binary pulsar accompanied by a 0.9  @xmath10 white dwarf .",
    "it lies near the ecliptic plane , so that only the component of proper motion along the ecliptic longitude can be accurately measured with pulsar timing method @xcite .",
    "for these two pulsars , the astrometry results obtained by various methods are by now very different ( see table  [ tabpara ] ) .",
    "so , it is meaningful to perform vlbi astrometry on these pulsars and further study their related astrophysics .",
    ".the distance and proper motion of psr  b1257 + 12 and psr  j1022 + 1001 [ cols=\"^,<,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabpara ]",
    "the flux density of psr  b1257 + 12 and psr  j1022 + 1001 is about 2 and 3  mjy at 1400  mhz , respectively .",
    "the corresponding observing wavelength of vlba and evn is 21  cm and 18  cm , respectively . including 5 epochs of vlba observation and 4 epochs of evn observation ,",
    "there are 9 epochs of vlbi observations of psr  b1257 + 12 spanning 2 years . in the vlba observations of psr  b1257 + 12 , two calibrators , j1300 + 1206 and j1300",
    "+ 141a , located on opposite sides of psr  b1257 + 12 in ra direction with the separation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , were selected as phase reference sources . in the evn observations of psr  b1257 + 12 , only j1300 + 141a",
    "was selected as the phase reference source .",
    "one phase reference source at @xmath13 away was chosen in psr  j1022 + 1001 observations with the evn .",
    "only 3 of 5 epochs evn observations of psr  j1022 + 1001 were successful .",
    "the vlba and evn data were correlated with nrao - difx and bonn - difx software correlators under the pulsar binning mode , respectively .",
    "the data was processed with aips following the normal data reduction steps of phase reference observations .",
    "firstly , the astrometric parameters of psr  b1257 + 12 are fitted with the standard weighted least squares method with 5 degrees of freedom that astrometry measurements usually use .",
    "but , there are some systematic offset in the dec direction between vlba results and evn results . to overcome this ,",
    "one more parameter @xmath14 is added to the new data fitting .",
    "the reduced @xmath15 of the new fitting is 0.67 with a fitted systematic offset @xmath14 of 1.22  mas .",
    "the parallax fitted is @xmath16  mas , which corresponds to a distance @xmath0  pc .",
    "the corresponding proper motion in ra and dec direction is @xmath17 and @xmath18 mas / yr . the covariance between parallax ( @xmath19 ) and proper motion ( @xmath3 , @xmath20 ) is -0.0239 and -0.0897 , respectively . for comparison",
    "our astrometric measurement results are listed in table  [ tabpara ] .",
    "some debris left over from the planet formation may cause psr  b1257 + 12 to be of low apparent x - ray efficiency .",
    "it is hard to conclude whether this pulsar is low apparent x - ray efficient or not because of distance uncertainties @xcite .",
    "according to the x - ray measurement results from @xcite and our new distance result , for the 90% confidence lower boundary of the distance 649  pc , the x - ray efficiency of this pulsar is @xmath21 .",
    "the best fitted distance 710  pc gives an x - ray efficiency of @xmath22 .",
    "so , our new vlbi result indicates that the x - ray efficiency of psr  b1257 + 12 should still be in the same range ( @xmath23 ) as other msps .",
    "as we only have 3  epochs of successful observations of psr  j1022 + 1001 with the evn , it is impossible to fit both the distance and proper motion of this pulsar . using the distance ( @xmath4300  pc ) of psr  j1022 + 1001 obtained with timing method @xcite , the two dimensional proper motions @xmath24  mas / yr , @xmath25  mas / yr , as estimated with these 3  epochs evn measurements .",
