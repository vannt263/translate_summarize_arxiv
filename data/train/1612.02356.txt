    "this paper deals with the following open problem : let @xmath4 be a continuous map of degree @xmath1 , @xmath5 , and let @xmath6 denote the number of fixed points of @xmath7 .",
    "when does the growth rate inequality @xmath8 hold for @xmath9 ?",
    "( this is problem 3 posed in @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that this inequality does not always hold .",
    "the simplest example is the map expressed in polar coordinates in @xmath10 as @xmath11 and extended to the sphere with @xmath12 .",
    "it has degree @xmath1 and just two periodic points . in @xcite other examples",
    "are presented , where the nonwandering set is not reduced to the set of periodic points . on the other hand , the inequality is known to hold if @xmath9 is a rational map @xcite , if @xmath9 is @xmath13 and preserves the latitude foliation @xcite and @xcite , if the critical points form a two - periodic cycle @xcite , and if all periodic orbits are isolated as invariant sets and @xmath9 has no sources of degree @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite . whenever the growth rate inequality holds , we say that @xmath9 _ has the rate_.    we will work with branched coverings and make the following assumption : there exists @xmath16 connected , open , proper ( i.e. a _ region _ ) , simply connected and completely invariant ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this allows the localization of the set where the periodic points live : the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "these two assumptions ( branched covering + completely invariant simply connected region ) are strong assumptions , but there will be more , as all known examples of maps not having the rate satisfy these two assumptions .",
    "these examples also satisfy that there are exactly two fixed critical points of multiplicity @xmath18 , one in @xmath3 and the other one in the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "it follows that @xmath9 can be thouhgt as a covering map of the open annulus @xmath19 .",
    "related work in the annulus was developed in the sequel @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where various sets of sufficient conditions for a map to have the rate are given .",
    "a _ branched covering _ of the sphere is a covering map of the sphere except at a finite number of critical points were it is locally conjugate to @xmath20 in the open disc , for some integer @xmath21 depending on the critical point .",
    "the _ multiplicity _ of the critical point is @xmath22 and it is well known ( riemann - hurwitz formula ) that the sum of the multiplicities of critical points is equal to @xmath23 , where @xmath1 is the degree of @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , if a region @xmath3 is completely invariant and simply connected , then it contains exactly @xmath18 critical points ( counted with multiplicities ) .    as pointed out before , having exactly one fixed critical point of multiplicity @xmath18 in the boundary of @xmath3 is an obstruction to having the rate . in the case",
    "that the boundary of @xmath3 is locally connected , we show that this is the only one : + * theorem a. * _ let @xmath9 be a degree @xmath1 branched covering of the sphere , where @xmath5 .",
    "assume that there exists a completely invariant simply connected region @xmath3 whose boundary component is locally connected .",
    "assume moreover that it is not the case that there exists only one critical point in the boundary of @xmath3 that has multiplicity @xmath18 and is fixed by @xmath9",
    ". then @xmath9 has the rate . _",
    "+ we do not know if the local connectivity hypothesis is necessary ( but suspect it is not ) . a main ingredient in the proof of theorem a is theorem [ t2 ] , that states that @xmath9 extends continuously to the prime end closure of @xmath3 .",
    "now , this extension gives a circle map of degree @xmath1 which , of course , has the rate .",
    "now , using that the boundary of @xmath3 is locally connected , to each periodic point in this circle at infinity , corresponds a periodic point of @xmath9 in the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "however , this correspondece is not injective , so in order to get the rate one has to understand how many different rays can land at the same point .",
    "an example to have in mind is when @xmath9 is a complex polynomial with connected and locally connected julia set .",
    "then @xmath9 has a supperatracting fixed point at infinity and the region @xmath3 is its basin of attraction , which is the complement of the filled julia set .",
    "figure [ rayos ] shows different periodic rays landing at the same point , namely the periodic orbit @xmath24 is reduced to a point in the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "more figures illustrating this phenomenon can be found in chapter 18 in @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    so , in particular , theorem a is a topological version of the fact that complex polynomials ( with connected and locally connected julia set ) have the rate .",
    "following the polynomial analogy , the opposite situation corresponds to the case when all critical points belong to the complement of the filled julia set .",
    "we also give a topological version of the fact that such maps have the rate : + * theorem b. * _ let @xmath9 be a degree @xmath1 branched covering of the sphere , where @xmath5 .",

    "in this section we prove a theorem extending caratheodory s theory .",
    "this result will be used to establish a relation between the periodic points of @xmath9 and those of @xmath27 , the map defined in the unit circle as @xmath28 .      in this section",

    "it contains just a generalization of a well known theorem of extension of a homeomorphism of a simply connected plane region @xmath3 to its prime ends closure : caratheodory s theorem .",

    ". we will show that a branched covering also extends to the prime ends closure of @xmath3 .",
    "we recall some definitions first .",
    "a crosscut in @xmath3 is a simpe arc whose interior is contained in @xmath3 and whose extreme points belong to @xmath29 , the boundary of @xmath3 .",

    "two sequences @xmath34 and @xmath36 of admissible crosscuts are equivalent if for every @xmath37 there exist @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "an equivalence class of admissible crosscuts define a prime end .",
    "this construction has the following property proved by carathodory : let @xmath42 be the union of @xmath3 with the set of prime ends .",
    "then there is a topology on @xmath42 turning @xmath42 into a topological closed disc whose interior is homeomorphic to @xmath3 with its plane topology . moreover , if @xmath9 is a homeomorphism of the closure of @xmath3 in the plane , then @xmath9 has a continuous extension to @xmath42 .",
    "the following is an extension of this result .",
    "[ t2 ] let @xmath9 be a degree @xmath1 branched covering of the sphere , and @xmath3 a simply connected completely invariant region whose complement contains more than one point .",
    "then @xmath9 extends to a continuous map @xmath43 in the prime ends closure of @xmath3 .",
    "moreover @xmath43 restricted to the boundary of @xmath42 is a degree @xmath1 covering map .",
    "as the complement of @xmath3 has more than one point and is connected , we can assume that @xmath3 is a bounded region of the plane @xmath10 . by the assumption that @xmath9 is a degree @xmath1 branched covering of @xmath3",
    ", it follows that @xmath9 has @xmath18 critical points ( counted with multiplicities ) in @xmath3 ( riemann - hurwitz formula ) .",
    "take @xmath44 a simple closed curve in @xmath3 such that all critical values lie in @xmath45 , the bounded component of @xmath46 .",
    "then , @xmath47 is a simple closed curve , and @xmath48 is a degree @xmath1 covering map , where @xmath49 is the annulus bounded by @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 denote a prime end .",
    "it is claimed first that there exists a sequence @xmath34 of crosscuts defining @xmath52 such that @xmath9 restricted to @xmath53 is injective for each @xmath38 .",
    "first note that the crosscuts can be constructed in such a way that both extreme points have different images , as the critical points in the boundary of @xmath3 are also branched points .",
    "let @xmath54 be the diameter of @xmath45 . if each @xmath53 is small enough then @xmath55 does not intersect @xmath45 and has diameter less than @xmath56 ( use here that @xmath9 extends continuously to the closure of @xmath3 ) .",
    "let @xmath57 and @xmath58 be different points in @xmath53 such that @xmath59 .",
    "then the image under @xmath9 of the segment @xmath60 in @xmath53 joining @xmath57 and @xmath58 can not be homotopically trivial in @xmath61 . but this is absurd by the choice of @xmath56 and the crosscuts @xmath53 .",
    "this proves the claim .",
    "+ the claim implies immediately that @xmath62 is a sequence of crosscuts , and thus defines a prime end @xmath63 .",
    "continuity is obvious by the definition of the topology of @xmath42 and the continuity of @xmath9 in the closure of @xmath3 , so it remains to prove the last assertion . given a prime end @xmath52 defined by a sequence of crooscuts @xmath34 ,",
    "let @xmath64 be a simple arc in @xmath3 joining @xmath44 with a point in the boundary of @xmath3 and such that @xmath65 for all @xmath38 .",
    "then the preimage of @xmath64 under @xmath9 is the union of @xmath1 simple arcs each one of which joins @xmath47 with a point in the boundary of @xmath3 and whose interiors are pairwise disjoint ( recall that @xmath48 is a covering ) .",
    "then @xmath66 has exactly @xmath1 connected components , restricted to each of which the map @xmath9 is injective and onto @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that each @xmath53 has an @xmath9-preimage in each of these components , so @xmath68 contains exactly @xmath1 points .",
    "note that no condition was imposed on the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "note also that @xmath9 may have critical points in the boundary of @xmath3 , but in any case it is part of the assertion of the theorem that the restriction of @xmath43 to the boundary of @xmath42 ( that is homeomorphic to the circle ) has no critical points .",
    "this is illustrated in the following example .",
    "+ * example . *",
    "the complex polynomial @xmath69 satisfies the hypothesis of the theorem above .",
    "the region @xmath3 is the complement of the interval @xmath70 $ ] in the real axis .",
    "the critical point @xmath30 belongs to the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "however , each point in the open interval represent two different prime ends while the extreme points @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent only one prime end .",
    "the two prime ends whose impression is the critical point @xmath30 have the same image under the map @xmath43 .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath43 has no critical points .      beginning with the proof of theorem a , let @xmath9 be a degree @xmath1 branched covering of the sphere and let @xmath3 be a completely invariant simply connected region . by assumption ,",
    "the boundary of @xmath3 is not a unique point , so theorem 1 holds for @xmath9 .",
    "there is no loss of generality in assuming that there is a unique critical point in @xmath3 , say @xmath73 , with multiplicity @xmath18 . indeed , as in the proof of theorem 1",
    ", @xmath9 is a covering map of degree @xmath1 from a semi - closed annulus which is a neighbourhood of @xmath50 onto its image , and we may collapse the boundary of this annulus to a point , which will be critical . as the periodic points will be found on @xmath50 , where the dynamics of @xmath9 remains unchanged , the proof under this assumption will suffice .",
    "a ray in @xmath3 is a simple arc joining @xmath73 with a point in @xmath29 , the boundary of @xmath3 . for each prime end",
    "one can choose a ray intersecting every crosscut defining the prime end . as we are assuming that @xmath29 is locally connected , each prime end defines a point in @xmath29 ( see , for example , chapter 17 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , if the prime end @xmath52 is @xmath74- fixed , so is the landing point for @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , in this case , if @xmath53 is a sequence of crosscuts defining @xmath52 , then @xmath76 is a sequence of crosscuts defining the same prime end as @xmath53 ( see subsection [ 21 ] ) .    by lemma 1 in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath77 is semiconjugate to @xmath28 acting on @xmath78 , this means that there exists a continuous degree one map @xmath79 such that @xmath80 .",
    "moreover it is shown that @xmath81 is monotonically increasing , meaning that if @xmath82 is the universal covering of the circle , then any lift @xmath83 of @xmath81 is monotonically increasing .",
    "of course @xmath81 may have intervals where it is constant , but the fact that it has degree one implies the following : if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are different points with the same @xmath43-image , then @xmath84 ( see item ( 2 ) after definition 2 in the above cited reference ) .",
    "it is easy to find right inverses of @xmath81 @xmath85 .",
    "of course none of them will be continuous , unless the semiconjugacy @xmath81 is actually a conjugacy .",
    "choose a right inverse @xmath86 of @xmath81 such that @xmath87 and @xmath86 is monotonically increasing .",
    "now the assumption that @xmath29 is locally connected will be used to define a map @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the impression of @xmath52 , a unique point in @xmath29 . note that @xmath90 is continuous , surjective and @xmath91 .",
    "the map @xmath90 is not injective since different prime ends may have the same impression in @xmath29 .",
    "of course , if two rays @xmath92 and @xmath93 representing different prime ends @xmath94 and @xmath95 , land at the same point @xmath96 , then this point separates @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the union of these rays with @xmath58 separates the whole sphere , and @xmath90 sends each component of @xmath97 into the closure of a component of @xmath98 .",
    "it may happen as well , that some point in the interior of an arc from @xmath94 to @xmath95 also has its impression at the point @xmath58 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we turn now into the ideas for the proof of theorem a. note that @xmath43 , being a degree @xmath1 covering map of the circle , has at least @xmath99 points with period that divides @xmath38 , or which is the same , @xmath100 has at least @xmath99 fixed points : this is obvious for @xmath27 and follows for @xmath43 because of the semiconjugacy . as was explained earlier , to each of the fixed points of @xmath100 corresponds ( taking impressions ) a fixed point of @xmath7 . however , as many different points may have the same impression , in order to have the rate one has to control this possibility .",
    "counting will be easier to perform with the map @xmath27 instead of @xmath43 , so define the map @xmath101 , that satisfies @xmath102 , and so it carries periodic points of @xmath27 into periodic points of @xmath9 .",
    "two @xmath27-periodic points @xmath57 and @xmath58 in @xmath78 are said equivalent if @xmath103 .",

    "the lemma proved above shows that the points @xmath108 and @xmath109 obtained separate the circle in such a way that ( almost always ) a point in one component can not be identified by @xmath140 with a point in another component .",
