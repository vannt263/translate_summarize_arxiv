    "in this work we used a semiclassical approximation for the spectra of one - dimensional inverse power - law potentials to construct approximate coherent states , relevant for these potentials .",

    "( [ eqi9 ] ) should be perceived as a sort of trial parameters which should asymptoticaly reproduce @xmath3 via eq .",
    "( [ eqi10 ] ) .",
    "this leads , of course , to a multiplicity of possible choices of @xmath43 leading to the same @xmath3 .",
    "the price of this approximation is the fact , that the temporal stability characterizing exact gazeau - klauder cs @xcite denoted by @xmath198 ( i.e. the equality @xmath199 ) will be only approximately satisfied by the states of eq .",
    "( [ eqi6 ] ) . on the contrary , the basic gazeau - klauder axiom of the resolution of unity",
    "is fully maintained in our construction .    for certain values of @xmath5 ,",
    "more precisely for rational @xmath5 such that @xmath6 and for @xmath200 , we are able to produce many resolutions of unity that are asymptotically relevant for one and the same @xmath5 .",
    "this is due in the first place to two key formulae , eq .",
    "( [ eqi24 ] ) and  ( [ eqi32 ] ) which involve the use of the inverse laplace transform . for other values of @xmath5 in the range @xmath201 ( except @xmath108 ) our approach does not produce any required solutions for the resolution of unity .",
    "we should comment here on the nature of approximation involved in the formulation of eq .",
    "( [ eqi6 ] ) . since for general @xmath5 and @xmath40 neither exact spectra nor exact eigenfunctions @xmath35",

    "( [ eqi6 ] ) we substitute the quasiclassical approximation for @xmath3 instead of the exact spectrum .",
    "this means that we are using the asymptotic approximation in the low energy region , where its use is not _ a priori _ justified .",
    "however , for certain values of @xmath5 the quasiclassical approximation is very successful even down to the low energy : in fact , for the linear repulsive potential @xmath202 ( @xmath203 ; @xmath204 , @xmath205 ) it predicts the correct energies and wave functions right down to the ground state @xcite . for attractive potentials ,",
    "for which in general one does not have exact solutions , the agreement is less spectacular @xcite but in general the quasiclassical approximation works well in large parts of the spectra and not only for @xmath38 , in which region it tends to the exact solution .",
