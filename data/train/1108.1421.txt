    "although perfect channel state information at transmitter ( csit ) may not be available in most practical scenarios due to time - varying nature of wireless channels , many wireless applications must still guarantee secure and reliable communication . in fast fading scenarios , the channel estimation / feedback process is often slower than the coherence time and csit may be further outdated . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered such a scenario in the context of multi - input single - output ( miso ) broadcast channels  ( bcs ) . by assuming delayed csit from each receiver and perfect csi at the receivers , they established the optimal sum - degrees of freedom  ( dof ) .",
    "these results show that , by a careful design of linear precoding schemes , completely outdated csit , i.e. independent of the current channel state , can still significantly increase the dof .",
    "recently , @xcite extended the work for two - user multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) bcs and characterized the dof region .",
    "the same feedback model has also been studied in @xcite where the so - called retrospective interference alignment has been proposed for networks with distributed encoders  ( e.g. interference channels and x - channels ) . finally , @xcite established the dof region of the two - user mimo interference channel .",
    "the secrecy capacity of miso gaussian wiretap channel is not fully understood yet for the cases of partial ( or imperfect ) csit . due to the difficulty of its complete characterization , a number of contributions have focused on secrecy degrees of freedom ( sdof ) capturing the behavior in high signal - to - noise ( snr ) regime  ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "references @xcite investigated compound models where the channel uncertainty is modeled as a set of finite states , while @xcite considered the case when the transmitter knows some special structure of the block - fading channels of receivers . in this paper , inspired by recent exciting results , we study the impact of delayed csit on the miso gaussian wiretap and the miso gaussian bc with confidential messages ( bcc ) .",
    "we assume that delayed csi is available both at the transmitter and at the receivers ( or eavesdroppers ) , where each receiver knows its own instantaneous channel .",
    "we consider two different cases for the wiretap channel : ( i ) the `` asymmetric scenario '' where the transmitter has delayed csi of either the legitimate channel or the eavesdropper channel , and ( ii ) the `` symmetric scenario '' where the transmitter has delayed csi of both channels .",
    "it is shown that , similarly to the conclusion drawn in @xcite , delayed csit can increase the sdof .",
    "more precisely , by means of simple artificial noise schemes , a sdof of @xmath1 can be guaranteed in the asymmetric scenario while a sdof of @xmath0 is ensured in the symmetric case .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0 is the fundamental sdof for symmetric scenario .",
    "then , we consider the miso bcc where the transmitter wishes to send two messages respectively to two receivers while keeping each of them secret to the unintended receiver .",
    "we characterize the sdof region and show that the artificial noise to convey two messages enables to achieve the sum rate sdof point @xmath2 .",
