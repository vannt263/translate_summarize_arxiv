    "the goal of this paper is to establish existence and smoothness of the stable foliation for sectional hyperbolic flows .",
    "in particular , we treat the case of the classical lorenz equations  @xcite @xmath2 showing that the stable foliation for the flow is at least @xmath1 .",
    "this regularity ( @xmath3 for some @xmath4 ) is a crucial component of the analysis in  @xcite where we prove exponential decay of correlations for the lorenz attractor .",
    "an immediate consequence of our result is that the stable foliation for the associated poincar map is also at least @xmath1 .",
    "the results are robust in the sense that we obtain smoothness of the stable foliations and exponential decay of correlations for smooth vector fields that are sufficiently @xmath0-close to the classical one .    as far as we know , this is the first complete proof that the stable foliation for the classical lorenz equations ( or even for the poincar map ) exists and is better than hlder continuous . by  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "the classical lorenz attractor is a singular hyperbolic attractor .",
    "a consequence is the existence of smooth stable leaves through each point of the attractor .",
    "however , _ a priori _ it does not follow that these leaves form a topological foliation in a full neighborhood of the attractor ; nor is there any information about smoothness of such a foliation .",
    "these issues are somewhat controversial , with various false claims in the literature .",
    "careful analyses ( see for example  @xcite ) require additional conditions to establish smoothness and do not apply to the classical lorenz attractor .",
    "recently  @xcite gave a verifiable criterion for smoothness of the stable foliation that is easily seen to hold for the classical lorenz attractor .",
    "however , the argument in  @xcite presupposes that the stable leaves topologically foliate a full neighborhood of the attractor  a fact that is folklore but for which apparently there is no proof available in the literature .    in this paper , we consider general partially hyperbolic attractors and give a complete proof of the existence of a topological foliation @xmath5 in a neighborhood of such attractors .",
    "the individual leaves @xmath6 are smoothly embedded stable manifolds . in general",
    ", the leaves need not vary smoothly , but under a bunching condition  @xcite the foliation is smooth .",
    "the argument in  @xcite now applies , and we obtain existence and smoothness of the stable foliation for the classical lorenz attractor .",

    "this resolves an issue in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2.4 ) where it is claimed that the stable foliation for the poincar map is smooth but no details are provided .",
    "in addition , we extend the verifiable criterion of  @xcite to the sectional hyperbolic situation , and we give a lower bound for the smoothness for the classical lorenz attractor . the condition is verifiable in the sense that it depends only on the linearised vector field and the location of the attractor and its equilibria .    in section  [ sec : lorenzmodel ]",
