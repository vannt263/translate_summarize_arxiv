    "hopf algebras were introduced in the 1950 s from three different perspectives : algebraic groups in positive characteristic , cohomology rings of lie groups , and group objects in the category of von neumann algebras .",

    "furthermore , every finite - dimensional hopf algebra @xmath5 gives rise to a quasi - triangular hopf algebra , namely the drinfeld double @xmath8 as vector space .",
