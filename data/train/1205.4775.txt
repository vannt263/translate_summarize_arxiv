    "quantum coherence is essential to the understanding and control of the dynamics in a quantum system . with the advances of experimental techniques and technologies , extreme ultraviolet ( xuv )",
    "attosecond pulse trains ( apt ) and single attosecond pulses ( sap ) have been produced through the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) process , by exposing atoms to intense infrared lasers .",
    "since the natural time scale of the electronic motion of valence electrons in atoms and molecules is in the order of hundreds of attoseconds , these pulses can be used to manipulate or control electron dynamics at the attosecond level  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "pump - probe scheme is used experimentally where the dynamics of the system is investigated by varying the time delay between the pulses . however , existing xuv sap and apt are too feeble to be used for xuv - pump - xuv - probe measurements . instead ,",
    "most of the experiments have been carried out using the weak xuv - pump with an intense ir - probe pulse .",
    "rigorously speaking , the ir can be considered as a probe only if it is applied after the xuv pump ends . in such case ,",
    "the electron wave packet generated by the apt or the sap is probed . in most experiments , however , measurements are also made where the xuv and ir overlap in time .",
    "since the ir is much stronger than the xuv , such measurements are better understood as laser - assisted photoionization .    in xuv+ir experiments ,",
    "the interaction of the xuv+ir field with the target atom is a nonlinear process . to treat such problems theoretically ,",
    "the brute - force numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) has been carried out by many groups where the target atom is treated within the single electron approximation .",
    "for apt+ir , floquet approach  @xcite has also been employed as well . with much efforts ,",
    "tdse calculations have been performed for two - electron helium atom and two - electron hydrogen molecules and compared with measurements  @xcite .",
    "still , simplified theoretical models are highly desirable in order to acquire a better understanding of the dynamics .",
    "these models , clearly , have to depend on the physical systems on hand . to be specific",
    ", we will focus on helium atom where many experiments have been carried out .    the first type of xuv+ir experiments used apt where the photon energy runs from below to above the single ionization threshold of helium  @xcite .",
    "spectra of electrons or ions have been measured and calculations based on tdse and floquet theory reported  @xcite . in the limit of non - overlapping apt and ir ,",
    "a simplified theory has been reported where the aim was to extract the electron wave packet generated by the apt  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , photon spectra can also be measured  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "effect due to propagation in the medium has to be considered  @xcite .",
    "as the energy of the xuv photon increases beyond the single - ionization threshold , it enters a structureless spectral region ( about 25 to 55 ev ) . in this case",
    ", the addition of an intense ir to the xuv is to shift the momentum of the continuum electron along the polarization direction of the ir laser , resulting in the `` streaking '' of photoelectrons where the energies depend on the vector potential of the ir laser at the time of the electron emission .",
    "a `` streaking '' theory based on the strong field approximation ( sfa )  @xcite has been widely used .",
    "this theory also forms the basis of the frequency - resolved optical gating for complete reconstruction of attosecond bursts method  @xcite for extracting the pulse duration of an sap . at a still higher photon energy of 60 ev",
    ", the xuv alone will reach the spectral region where doubly - excited states of helium are located . in this paper , we will focus on this energy region and consider the dynamics of the doubly excited state generated by the xuv pulse in the presence of an ir pulse at different delay times .",
    "doubly excited states have been widely studied using synchrotron radiations since the 1960 s  @xcite .",
    "these are autoionizing states where the lifetime of a state is typically of a few to tens of femtoseconds .",
    "these lifetimes are deduced from the measured spectral width ; thus high - precision spectroscopic measurement is needed . with the emergence of sap , the lifetime of an auger resonance was first measured in the time domain and analyzed by the xuv+ir streaking theory in 2002  @xcite .",
    "however , the evolution of the spectral shape of a resonance state has not been determined so far in the time - domain measurements , which in principle can be investigated with attosecond pulses .",
    "in fact , the autoionization theory was formulated in the energy domain by fano  @xcite .",
    "this issue was addressed recently by us  @xcite and an experimental scheme was proposed .",
    "the scheme , however , requires an attosecond xuv - pump to create the resonance and an attosecond xuv - probe to project out the time - evolution of the resonance .",
    "such measurement is not possible yet .",
    "thus for the time domain measurements so far , doubly - excited states still have to be `` probed '' using an ir pulse . for an isolated fano resonance generated in a combined xuv+ir pulse ,",
    "the problem has been examined by wickenhauser _",
    "a simpler model was proposed by zhao _",
    "@xcite based on sfa .",
    "an xuv+ir experiment on helium doubly - excited states has been reported by loh _",
    "@xcite , where a 30 fs xuv pulse was used to excite the @xmath0 doubly excited state in the presence of a 42 fs ir laser .",
    "the absorption spectra near the @xmath3 resonance were measured vs the time delay between the pulses .",
    "the result was then interpreted by a theory that includes the strong coupling between the @xmath3 and @xmath1 states by the ir . in this experiment , the pulse duration of the xuv was longer than the lifetime of the @xmath3 autoionizing state , i.e. , the bandwidth of the light was narrower than the resonance width .",
    "thus , the continuum electrons in a measurement did not have a meaningful `` distribution '' for such a narrow bandwidth .",
    "a single pump could not reveal any significant spectroscopic features ; instead , sequential measurements were made where the detuning of the xuv was controlled and scanned through an energy range .",
    "the scanned spectra were able to exhibit the autoionization modified by the time - delayed ir , thus providing the temporal information of the system partially .",
    "more recently , an 100 as sap was used by gilbertson _",
    "@xcite to excite helium in the presence of a 9 fs ir pulse .",
    "the central energy of the excitation is at the @xmath3 resonance , and the photoelectron spectra near this resonance vs time delay were reported .",
    "the result was interpreted based on the theory of zhao _ et al _",
    "@xcite from which the decay lifetime of @xmath3 was retrieved .",
    "however , the spectral shape of the resonance was not analyzed due to the limited resolution of 0.7 ev of the electron spectrometer .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , the interpretation was made by the streaking model of zhao _ et al _",
    ". since the ir wavelength used in the two experiments are about the same , the role of strong coupling between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states in this experiment should be addressed .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "the present analysis limits the hilbert space to including only the two autoionizing states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the ground state .",
    "while the xuv can populate other higher doubly excited states , they are weaker in the spectrum and are easily ionized by the ir . governed by the detuning of the 9 fs ir , only the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states are strongly coupled .",
    "the dynamics of such a system is then studied with a theory generalized from the standard three - level system formulated earlier  @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "we develop a model for the ir - dressed autoionization of the @xmath3 resonance in helium excited by an sap , where the ir strongly couples the @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances and also ionizes both doubly - excited states .",
    "both effects by the ir have to be included in order to explain the observed electron spectra reported in ref .  @xcite . after achieving good agreement with the experiment",
    ", we further investigate the case where @xmath3 and @xmath2 are coupled by changing the laser wavelength to 540  nm .",
    "the latter state has a higher binding energy such that it is not ionized by the laser .",
    "such measurements would be closer to the standard electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) experiment  @xcite .",
    "we will look for the presence of the autler - townes doublet  @xcite which are routinely generated by three - level systems with long pulses .    in sec .",
