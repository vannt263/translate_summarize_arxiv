    "most of one - dimensional non - equilibrium systems with stochastic dynamics show unique collective behaviors in their steady - states which usually can not be found in their equilibrium counterparts .",
    "non - equilibrium phase transition and shock formation are two examples of these remarkable behaviors .",
    "non - equilibrium systems are also interesting to study from a mathematical point of view .",
    "these systems have opened up new horizon of research in the field of exactly solvable systems  @xcite .    during the last decade",
    "several non - equilibrium exactly solvable systems have been introduced and studied in related literature . on the other hand",
    ", different mathematical techniques have been developed to study their steady - state properties .",
    "a matrix method , known as the matrix product method , is introduced and used to calculate the steady - state and the average value of the physical quantities in the steady - state of these systems  @xcite .",
    "the excitations , which give the relaxation times , can also be obtained using the _ bethe ansatz _",
    "recently , there has been attempts to establish connections between bethe ansatz and matrix product method  @xcite .",
    "other interesting quantities include the large deviation function for the probability distribution of fluctuating quantities , such as the particle current , in the steady - state of these systems  @xcite .",
    "the large deviation function can be obtained , through a legendre - fenchel transformation , from the minimum eigenvalue of a modified hamiltonian .",
    "we are then basically left with finding the minimum eigenvalue of a matrix .",
    "the number of systems for which this quantity can be calculated exactly is very limited .    in this paper",
    "we consider a stochastic system of classical particles in which the particles interact with each other according to a variant of the zero - temperature glauber dynamics on a lattice with open boundaries  @xcite .",
    "more precisely the particles are injected and extracted from the first and the last sites of the lattice respectively . in the bulk of the lattice , on the other hand , the particles are subjected to totally asymmetric branching and death processes .",
    "the steady - state of this system has already been calculated using the matrix product method  @xcite .",
    "it is known that this steady - state can be written as a linear combination of product shock measures with one shock front and that these shock fronts have simple random walk dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we are specially interested in the total particle current fluctuations in this system .",
    "as we mentioned , the large deviation function for the particle current fluctuations can be obtained from the legendre - fenchel transformation of the minimum eigenvalue of a modified hamiltonian .",
    "this modified hamiltonian can be constructed from the stochastic time evolution operator of the system ( sometimes called the hamiltonian ) .",
    "this can be done by multiplying the non - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian of the system by an exponential factor which counts the particle jumps contributing to the total particle current , see for example  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the modified hamiltonian associated with the total particle current fluctuations can be fully diagonalized .",
    "the key point is to change the basis of the vector space in an appropriate way by introducing a product shock measure with multiple shock fronts . in this new basis",
    "the modified hamiltonian becomes an upper block - bidiagonal matrix which is much easier to work with , because we only need to diagonalize the diagonal blocks .",
    "our analytical investigations reveal that for the small particle current fluctuations ( smaller than the average particle current in the steady - state to be more precise ) the eigenvector associated with the minimum eigenvalue of the modified hamiltonian should be written as a linear combination of product shock measures with a single shock front .",
    "in contrast , for the large particle current fluctuations ( larger than the average particle current in the steady - state to be more precise ) it should be written as a linear combination of product shock measures with more than one shock front .",
    "the validity of our analytical calculations is checked by comparing the analytical results with those obtained from numerical diagonalization of the modified hamiltonian .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we will review the known results on the steady - state properties of the system .",
    "the total particle current is also introduced and its average value in the steady - state is calculated . in the third section",
    "we will briefly review the basics of the particle current fluctuations .",
    "the forth section is devoted to the diagonalization of the modified hamiltonian .",
    "the minimum eigenvalue of the modified hamiltonian will be discussed in the fifth section .",
    "we will compare the analytical and numerical results in the sixth section .",
    "the concluding remarks are also given in the last section .",
    "let s consider a lattice of length @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that each lattice site can be occupied by at most one particle or a vacancy .",
    "the reaction rules between two consecutive sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the lattice are as follow @xmath3 in which a particle ( vacancy ) is labeled with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 )",
    ". a particle can enter the system from the left boundary of the lattice with the rate @xmath6 .",
    "a particle can also leave the system from the right boundary with the rate @xmath7 .",
    "this model is an asymmetric variant of zero - temperature glauber dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the probability distribution vector @xmath8 is given by a master equation  @xcite @xmath9 where the hamiltonian @xmath10 is an stochastic square matrix @xmath11 in which @xmath12 is a @xmath13 identity matrix and that we have defined @xmath14 introducing the basis kets @xmath15 the matrix representation of @xmath16 in the basis of @xmath17 and that of @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the basis of @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 the right eigenvector with vanishing eigenvalue of hamiltonian @xmath10 gives the steady - state probability distribution vector of the system .",
    "it is known that this vector can be written as a linear combination of product shock measures with a single shock front  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics of the position of a shock front is similar to that of a biased random walker moving on a finite lattice with reflecting boundaries .",
    "this steady - state probability distribution vector has also been obtained using a matrix product method in  @xcite . by associating the operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 to the presence of a vacancy and a particle in a given lattice site ,",

    "using  ( [ weight ] ) and  ( [ representation ] ) one can easily calculate the weight of any configuration in the steady - state and also the average value of the physical quantities , such as the particle current , in the long - time limit .",
    "let us call @xmath32 the average local density of particles at the lattice site @xmath1 at time @xmath33 .",

    "the time dependency of the quantities will be dropped and we find @xmath41 comparing  ( [ density evol ] ) and  ( [ current - density ] ) one finds the following relation for the average particle current in the steady - state @xmath42 and also the source terms which are defined as follows @xmath43 in which @xmath35 .",

    "the second dynamical rule in  ( [ rules ] ) clearly increase the particle current .",
    "the first dynamical rule in  ( [ rules ] ) can be considered as a backward movement of a vacancy .",
    "this is equivalent to a forward movement of a particle which , again , increases the particle current .",
    "similar examples of particle current in the presence of source terms can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the average local particle current in the steady - state can be calculated using the matrix product method .",
    "the result is    @xmath44    in which we have defined @xmath45 . defining the total particle current as @xmath46",
    "it is easy to see that in the limit of @xmath47 we have @xmath48 this indicates that the system undergoes a phase transition at @xmath49 .",
    "the phase @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is called the low - density ( high - density ) phase .",
    "assuming that the large deviation principle holds , the probability distribution for observing the total particle current @xmath52 in the system is given by @xmath53 which is valid for @xmath54 .",
    "the large deviation function @xmath55 measures the rate at which the total particle current deviates from its average value .",
    "it is known that the large deviation function @xmath55 is , according to the grtner - ellis theorem , the legendre - fenchel transform of the minimum eigenvalue of a modified hamiltonian @xmath56 , denoted by @xmath57 ,  @xcite @xmath58 the modified hamiltonian is defined as follows @xmath59 in which @xmath60 note that since the modified hamiltonian defined in  ( [ modified hamiltonian ] ) becomes equal to the stochastic time evolution operator given in  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) at @xmath61 then we have @xmath62 .",
