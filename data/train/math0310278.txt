    "we are given positive weights [ symbol : weight ] @xmath6 , which are the magnitudes of the point masses located at the corresponding nodes .",
    "we will occasionally use the alternate notation @xmath7 , @xmath8 [ symbol : weightfunc ] for a weight on the set of nodes @xmath9 ; thus @xmath10 one should not infer from this notation that @xmath7 has any meaning for any @xmath11 , complex or real , other than those @xmath8 ; even if @xmath12 has a convenient functional form , we will only ever evaluate @xmath7 when @xmath8 .",
    "the _ discrete orthogonal polynomials _ associated with this data are polynomials [ symbol : dop ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 is of degree exactly @xmath15 with a positive leading coefficient and where @xmath16 writing [ symbol : coeffs ] @xmath17 , we introduce distinguished notation for the positive leading coefficient : @xmath18 [ symbol : leadingcoeff ] and we denote by @xmath19 the associated monic polynomial : @xmath20 [ symbol : mdop ] the discrete orthogonal polynomials exist and are uniquely determined by the orthogonality conditions because the inner product associated with ( [ eq : ortho ] ) is positive definite on @xmath21 but is degenerate on larger spaces of polynomials .",
    "the polynomials @xmath14 may be constructed from the monomials by a gram - schmidt process .",
    "a general reference for properties of orthogonal polynomials specific to the discrete case is the book of nikiforov , suslov , and uvarov @xcite .",
    "one well - known elementary property of the discrete orthogonal polynomials is an exclusion principle for the zeros that forbids more than one zero from lying between adjacent nodes :    each discrete orthogonal polynomial @xmath14 has @xmath15 simple real zeros .",
    "all zeros lie in the range @xmath22 and no more than one zero lies in the closed interval @xmath23 $ ] between any two consecutive nodes .",
    "[ prop : confine ]    from the gram - schmidt process it follows that the coefficients of @xmath14 are all real .",
    "suppose that @xmath14 were to vanish to @xmath24th order for some nonreal @xmath25 .",
    "then it follows that @xmath14 also vanishes to the same order at @xmath26 , and thus that @xmath27 $ ] is a polynomial of lower degree , @xmath28 . by orthogonality , we must have on the one hand @xmath29 on the other hand , the left - hand side is strictly positive because @xmath30 so @xmath14 can not vanish at all of the nodes .",
    "so we have a contradiction and the roots must be real .",
    "the necessarily real roots are simple for a similar reason .",
    "if @xmath25 is a real root of @xmath14 of order greater than one , the quotient @xmath31 is a polynomial of degree @xmath32 , which must be orthogonal to @xmath14 itself : @xmath33 but the left - hand side is manifestly positive , which gives the desired contradiction .",
    "if a simple real zero @xmath25 of @xmath14 satisfies either @xmath34 or @xmath35 , then we repeat the above argument considering the polynomial @xmath36 of degree @xmath37 to which @xmath14 must be orthogonal , but for which the inner product is strictly of one sign .    finally if more than one zero of @xmath14",
    "were to lie between the consecutive nodes @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then we can certainly select two of them , say @xmath25 and @xmath40 , and construct the polynomial @xmath41 $ ] of degree @xmath32 . again",
    ", this polynomial must be orthogonal to @xmath14 , but the corresponding inner product is of one definite sign , leading to a contradiction .",
    "our goal is to establish the asymptotic behavior of the polynomials @xmath14 or their monic counterparts @xmath19 in the limit of large degree , assuming certain asymptotic properties of the nodes and the weights .",
    "in particular , the number of nodes must necessarily increase to admit polynomials with arbitrarily large degree , and the weights we consider involve an exponential factor with exponent proportional to the number of nodes ( such weights are sometimes called _ varying weights _ ) .",
    "we will obtain pointwise asymptotics with precise error bound uniformly valid in the whole complex plane .",
    "our assumptions on the nodes and weights include as special cases all relevant classical discrete orthogonal polynomials , but are significantly more general ; in particular , we will consider nodes that are not necessarily equally spaced . while the number of nodes will become large , it is important for our methods that this number is finite ; general weights supported on an infinite discrete set of nodes require modifications of the methods we will describe and will be considered in a subsequent paper .",
    "we will establish rigorous asymptotics for the discrete orthogonal polynomials subject to the following fundamental assumptions .",
    "we suppose the existence of a _ node density function _ [ symbol : rho0 ] @xmath42 that is real - analytic in a complex neighborhood of a closed interval [ symbol : nodeinterval ] @xmath43 $ ] , and that satisfies : @xmath44 and @xmath45$\\ , . }",
    "\\label{eq : rho0nonzero}\\ ] ] the nodes are then defined precisely in terms of the density function @xmath42 by the quantization rule @xmath46 for @xmath2 and @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the nodes lie in a bounded open interval @xmath48 and are distributed with density @xmath42 .      without loss of generality",
    ", we write the weights in the form @xmath49 [ symbol : vn ] no generality has been sacrificed with this representation because the family of functions @xmath50 is _ apriori _ specified only at the nodes ; in other words , given positive weights @xmath51 one may solve uniquely for the @xmath3 quantities @xmath52 .",
    "however , we now assume that for each sufficiently large @xmath3 , @xmath53 may be taken to be a real - analytic function defined in a complex neighborhood @xmath54 of the closed interval @xmath43 $ ] , and that @xmath55 where @xmath56 [ symbol : v ] is a fixed real - analytic function defined in @xmath54 , and @xmath57 [ symbol : eta ] note that in general the correction @xmath58 may depend on @xmath3 , although @xmath56 may not . in some cases ( _ e.g. _ krawtchouk polynomials ; see   [ sec : krawtchouk ] ) it is possible to take @xmath59 for all @xmath3 , in which case @xmath60 .",
    "however , the freedom of assuming @xmath61 is useful to handle other cases ( _ e.g. _ the hahn and associated hahn polynomials ; see   [ sec : hahn ] ) . while may be written for any system of positive weights , the condition that should hold restricts attention to systems of weights that have analytic continuum limits in a certain precise sense .",
    "the familiar examples of classical discrete orthogonal polynomials correspond to nodes that are equally spaced , say on @xmath62 ( in which case we have @xmath63 ) . in this special case ,",
    "the product factor on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : weightform ] ) becomes simply @xmath64 using stirling s formula to take the continuum limit of this factor ( that is , considering @xmath65 with @xmath66 ) shows that in these cases the leading term in the formula is a continuous weight on @xmath67 : @xmath68 as @xmath65 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "however , taking the continuum limit of the weight first to arrive at a formula like , and then obtaining asymptotics of the polynomials of degree proportional to @xmath3 as @xmath65 is not equivalent to the double - scaling limit process we will consider here .",
    "our results display new phenomena because we simultaneously take the continuum limit as the degree of the polynomials grows .",
    "our choice of the form ( [ eq : weightform ] ) for the weights is motivated by several specific examples of classical discrete orthogonal polynomials . the form ( [ eq : weightform ] ) is sufficiently general for us to carry out useful calculations related to proofs of universality conjectures arising in certain types of random tiling problems , random growth models , and last - passage percolation problems .",
    "we assume that the degree @xmath15 of the polynomial of interest is tied to the number @xmath3 of nodes by a relation of the form @xmath71 [ symbol : k ] where @xmath72 [ symbol : c ] is a fixed parameter , and @xmath73 [ symbol : kappa ] remains bounded as @xmath65 .      in order to keep our exposition as simple as possible ,",
    "we make further assumptions that exclude certain nongeneric triples @xmath74 .",
    "these assumptions depend on the functions @xmath42 and @xmath56 , and on the parameter @xmath75 , in an implicit manner that is easier to describe once some auxiliary quantities have been introduced .",
    "they will be given in ",
    "[ sec : c3 ] .    in regard to these particular assumptions , we want to stress two points .",
    "first , the excluded triples are nongeneric in the sense that any perturbation of , say , the parameter @xmath75 will immediately return us to the class of triples for which all of our results are valid . the discussion at the beginning of ",
    "[ sec : airy ] provides some insight into the generic nature of our assumptions .",
    "second , the discrete orthogonal polynomials corresponding to nongeneric triples can be analyzed by the same basic method that we use here , with many of the same results .",
    "to do this , the proofs we present will require modifications to include additional local analysis near certain isolated points in the complex @xmath76-plane .",
    "some such modifications have already been described in detail in the context of asymptotics for polynomials orthogonal with respect to continuous weights in   5 of @xcite .",
    "the remaining modifications have to do with nongeneric behavior near the endpoints of the interval @xmath43 $ ] , and while the corresponding local analysis has not been done before , it can be expected to be of a similar character .",
    "given an interval @xmath43 $ ] , appropriate fixed functions @xmath42 and @xmath56 , appropriate sequences @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and a constant @xmath72 , we wish to find accurate asymptotic formulae , valid in the limit @xmath65 with rigorous error bounds , for the polynomial @xmath19 .",
    "these formulae should be uniformly valid in overlapping regions of the complex @xmath76-plane .",
    "we will also require asymptotic formulae for related quantities , like the zeros of @xmath19 , the three - term recurrence coefficients , and the reproducing kernels @xmath79 .",
    "our work on this subject is connected with three different themes of current research .",
    "first of all , in the context of approximation theory , there has been recent activity @xcite in the study of polynomials orthogonal on the real axis with respect to general continuous varying weights and the corresponding large degree pointwise asymptotics .",
    "the setting for this work is the characterization of the orthogonal polynomials in terms of the solution of a certain matrix - valued riemann - hilbert problem @xcite .",
    "these methods are not at all particular to any special classical formulae for weights ; they are completely general .",
    "thus , a natural question to ask is whether it is possible to generalize the methods further to handle discrete weights .",
    "discrete weights are of such a fundamentally different character than their continuous counterparts that this would require the development of new analytical tools .",
    "in particular , each point mass added to the weight amounts to a pole in the matrix solution of the riemann - hilbert problem , so the problem is to analyze the asymptotics of an accumulation of poles .",
    "secondly , there has been some recent progress @xcite in the integrable systems literature concerning the problem of computing asymptotics for solutions of integrable nonlinear partial differential equations ( _ e.g. _ the nonlinear schrdinger equation ) in the limit where the spectral data associated with the solution via the inverse - scattering transform is made up of a large number of discrete eigenvalues .",
    "significantly , inverse - scattering theory also exploits much of the theory of matrix riemann - hilbert problems , and it turns out that the discrete eigenvalues appear as poles in the corresponding matrix - valued unknown .",
    "so , the methods recently developed in the context of inverse - scattering actually suggest a general scheme by means of which an accumulation of poles in the matrix unknown can be analyzed .",
    "finally , a number of problems in probability theory have recently been identified that are in some sense solved in terms of discrete orthogonal polynomials , and certain statistical questions can be translated into corresponding questions about the asymptotic behavior of the polynomials .",
    "the particular problems we have in mind are related to statistics of random tilings of various shapes , and also to certain natural measures on sets of partitions .",
    "the joint probability distributions in these problems are examples of so - called discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the analogy is that the relationship between universal asymptotic properties of discrete orthogonal polynomials and universal statistics of so - called discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles is the same as the relationship between universal asymptotic properties of polynomials orthogonal with respect to continuous weights and universal eigenvalue statistics of certain random matrix ensembles .",
    "we will give many more details later on , but for now the point is that the techniques required for computing asymptotics of discrete orthogonal polynomials with general weights have become available at just the time when questions that can be answered with these tools are appearing in the applied literature .",
    "given a natural number @xmath3 , a set @xmath9 of nodes , and a set of corresponding weights @xmath51 , consider the possibility of finding the matrix @xmath80 [ symbol : p ] solving the following problem , where @xmath15 is an integer .",

    "[ rhp : dop ]    this problem is a discrete version of the riemann - hilbert problem appropriate for orthogonal polynomials with continuous weights that was first used in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the solution of this problem encodes all quantities of relevance to a study of the discrete orthogonal polynomials , as we will now see .",

    ", @xmath89 if @xmath90 and @xmath91 [ prop : solnrhp ]    consider the first row of @xmath80 . according to ( [ eq : poles ] ) , the function @xmath92 is an entire function of @xmath76 . because @xmath93 it follows from the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] ) that in fact @xmath92 is a monic polynomial of degree exactly @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , from the characterization ( [ eq : poles ] ) of the simple poles of @xmath94 , we see that @xmath94 is necessarily of the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is an entire function .",
    "the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] ) for @xmath93 immediately requires , via liouville s theorem , that @xmath97 , and then when @xmath98 we have by geometric series expansion that @xmath99 according to the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] ) , @xmath100 as @xmath101 ; therefore it follows that the monic polynomial @xmath92 of degree exactly @xmath15 must satisfy @xmath102 as long as @xmath103 , these conditions uniquely identify @xmath92 with the monic discrete orthogonal polynomial @xmath19 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of @xmath19 for such @xmath15 is guaranteed given distinct orthogonalization nodes and positive weights ( definiteness of the inner product ) .",

    "the function @xmath104 is seen from ( [ eq : poles ] ) to be an entire function of @xmath76 , that according to the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] ) must be a polynomial of degree at most @xmath105 ( for the special case of @xmath106 these conditions immediately imply that @xmath107 ) . the characterization ( [ eq : poles ] )",
    "implies that @xmath108 can be expressed in the form @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an entire function . if @xmath106 , then @xmath111 and then according to the normalization condition ( [ eq : norm ] )",
    "we must take @xmath112 . on the other hand ,",

    "we find @xmath114 imposing the normalization conditions ( [ eq : norm ] ) we now insist that @xmath115 as @xmath83 ; therefore @xmath116 and @xmath117 using ( [ eq : secondroworthogonality ] ) , the condition ( [ eq : secondrownorm ] ) can be replaced by @xmath118p_{n , k-1}(x_{n , n})w_{n , n}=1 \\,.\\ ] ] these conditions therefore uniquely identify @xmath119 with the orthogonal polynomial @xmath120 .",
    "the interpolation problem is thus solved uniquely by the the matrix explicitly given by ( [ eq : usoln ] ) for @xmath90 and by ( [ eq : usolnzero ] ) for @xmath106 .",
    "an important feature of all systems of orthogonal polynomials , that is present whether the weights are discrete or continuous , is the well - known three - term recurrence relation .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "there are constants @xmath121 [ symbol : ank ] and positive constants @xmath122 [ symbol : bnk ] such that @xmath123 holds for @xmath124 , while for @xmath106 one has @xmath125 necessarily , one has @xmath126 .",

    "given nodes @xmath9 and weights @xmath51 , the dual polynomials arise by taking @xmath148 in the change of variables ( [ eq : ptoq ] ) , and then defining [ symbol : pbar][symbol : bark ] @xmath149 here @xmath150 [ symbol : sigma1 ] is another pauli matrix : @xmath151 thus , we are reversing the triangularity at all of the nodes , and swapping rows and columns of the resulting matrix .",

    "families of discrete orthogonal polynomials always come in dual pairs .",
    "an explicit relation between the dual polynomials comes from the representation of @xmath80 given by proposition  [ prop : solnrhp ] : @xmath162 since the left - hand side is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath163 and the right - hand side is apparently a polynomial of degree @xmath164 , equation ( [ eq : explicitdual ] ) furnishes @xmath15 relations among the weights and the normalization constants @xmath165 .    in particular , if we evaluate ( [ eq : explicitdual ] ) for @xmath166 for some @xmath167 , then only one term from the sum on the right - hand side survives and we find @xmath168 an identity relating values of each discrete orthogonal polynomial and a corresponding dual polynomial at any given node .",
    "the identity has also been derived by borodin @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by using ( [ eq : explicitdual ] ) twice , along with the fact that @xmath169 ( _ i.e. _ duality is an involution ) , we can obtain some additional identities involving the discrete orthogonal polynomials and their duals . by involution , ( [ eq : explicitdual ] ) implies that @xmath170 [ symbol : gammadual ] the sum on the right - hand side is the lagrange interpolating polynomial of degree @xmath164 ( at most ) that agrees with @xmath19 at all @xmath3 nodes .",
    "of course this identifies the sum with @xmath19 itself , upon which we find the relation @xmath171 between the normalization constants for the discrete orthogonal polynomials and their duals .",
    "we want to point out that the notion of duality described here is different from that explained in @xcite .",
    "the latter generally involves relationships between families of discrete orthogonal polynomials with two different sets of nodes of orthogonalization .",
    "for example , the hahn polynomials are orthogonal on a lattice of equally spaced points , and the polynomials dual to the hahn polynomials by the scheme of @xcite are orthogonal on a quadratic lattice for which @xmath172 is proportional to @xmath24",
    ". however , the polynomials dual to the hahn polynomials under the scheme described above are the associated hahn polynomials , which are orthogonal on the same equally - spaced nodes as are the hahn polynomials themselves .",
    "the notion of duality described above coincides with that described in @xcite and is also equivalent to the `` hole / particle transformation '' considered by johansson @xcite .",
    "the characterization of the discrete orthogonal polynomials in terms of interpolation problem  [ rhp : dop ] is the starting point for our asymptotic analysis .",
    "our rigorous analysis of @xmath80 consists of three steps :    1 .",
    "we introduce a change of variables , transforming @xmath80 into @xmath173 , another matrix function of @xmath76 .",
    "the transformation mediating between @xmath80 and @xmath173 is explicit and exact .",
    "the matrix @xmath173 is shown to satisfy a matrix riemann - hilbert problem that is equivalent to interpolation problem  [ rhp : dop ] .",
    "we construct an explicit model @xmath174 for @xmath173 on the basis of formal asymptotics .",
    "we call @xmath174 a _ global parametrix _ for @xmath173 .",
    "we compare @xmath173 to the global parametrix @xmath174 by considering the error @xmath175 , which should be close to the identity matrix if the formally obtained global parametrix @xmath174 is indeed a good approximation of @xmath173 .",
    "we rigorously analyze @xmath176 by viewing its definition in terms of @xmath173 as another change of variables , since @xmath174 is known explicitly from step 2 .",
    "this means that we may pose an equivalent riemann - hilbert problem for @xmath176 .",
    "we prove that this riemann - hilbert problem may be solved by a convergent neumann series if @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "the series for @xmath176 is also an asymptotic series whose first term is the identity matrix , such that @xmath177 is of order @xmath178 in a suitable precise sense .",
    "this gives an asymptotic formula for the unknown matrix @xmath179 .",
    "inverting the explicit change of variables from step 1 linking @xmath173 with @xmath80 , we finally arrive at an asymptotic formula for @xmath80 .",
    "the first step in this process is the most crucial , since the explicit transformation from @xmath80 and @xmath173 has to result in a problem that has been properly prepared for asymptotic analysis .",
    "the transformation is best presented as a composition of several subsequent transformations :    * a transformation is introduced from @xmath80 to a new unknown matrix @xmath138 having the effect of moving poles at some of the nodes in @xmath9 from the second column of @xmath80 to the first column of @xmath138 .",
    "this transformation turns out to be necessary in our approach to take into account subintervals of @xmath43 $ ] that are saturated with zeros of @xmath19 in the sense that there is a zero between each pair of neighboring nodes ( recall proposition  [ prop : confine ] ) .",
    "the saturated regions are not known in advance , but are detected by the equilibrium measure ( see step 1(c ) below ) . *",
    "the matrix @xmath138 is transformed into @xmath180 , a matrix that has , instead of polar singularities , a jump discontinuity across a contour in the complex @xmath76-plane along which @xmath180 takes continuous boundary values . to see how a pole may be removed at the cost of a jump across a contour , consider a point @xmath181 at which a matrix function @xmath182 is meromorphic , having a simple pole in the second column such that for some given constant @xmath183 : @xmath184 if @xmath185 is a scalar function analytic in the region @xmath186 for some @xmath187 having a simple pole at @xmath181 with residue @xmath183 ( obviously there are many such functions and consequently significant freedom in making a choice ) , then we may try to define a new matrix function @xmath188 by choosing some positive @xmath189 sufficiently small and setting @xmath190 it follows that the singularity of @xmath188 at @xmath191 is removable .",
    "therefore @xmath188 may be considered to be analytic in the region @xmath192 , and also at each point of the region @xmath193 where additionally @xmath182 is known to be analytic . in place of the residue condition , we now have a known jump discontinuity across the circle @xmath194 along which @xmath188 takes continuous boundary values from the inside ( denoted @xmath195 ) and the outside ( denoted @xmath196 ) : @xmath197 obviously , the disc @xmath192 can be replaced by another domain @xmath198 containing @xmath181 .",
    "this technique of removing poles was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "+ the problem at hand is more complicated because the number of poles grows in the limit of interest , and in this limit the poles accumulate on a fixed set , and thus it is not feasible to encircle each with its own circle of fixed size . in @xcite a generalization of the technique described above was developed precisely to allow for the simultaneous removal of a large number of poles in a way that is asymptotically advantageous as the number of poles increases .",
    "this generalization employs a single function @xmath185 with simple poles at @xmath38 for @xmath87 having corresponding residues @xmath199 , and makes the change of variables in a common domain @xmath198 containing all of the points @xmath200 . the essential asymptotic analysis",
    "is then related to the nature of the jump condition that generalizes for @xmath76 on the boundary of @xmath198 .",
    "this jump condition can have different asymptotic properties in the limit @xmath65 according to the placement of the boundary of @xmath198 in the complex plane .",
    "+ further difficulties arise here because it turns out that the correct location for the boundary of @xmath198 needed to facilitate the asymptotic analysis in the limit @xmath65 coincides in part with the interval @xmath43 $ ] that contains the poles , and in the context of the method of @xcite this leads to singularities in both the boundary values of the matrix unknown and also in the jump matrix relating the boundary values .",
    "these singularites are an obstruction to further analysis .",
    "therefore , the transformation we will introduce from @xmath138 to @xmath180 uses a further variation of the pole removal technique developed in @xcite in which two different residue interpolating functions @xmath201 and @xmath202 are used in respective disjoint domains @xmath203 and @xmath204 such that all of the poles @xmath38 are common boundary points of both domains .",

    "being careful with branches of the various multivalued functions involved , we find that @xmath2455 here when @xmath76 is in either of the intervals @xmath2456 or @xmath2457 where @xmath2399 is supposed to be analytic , the integral is interpreted as the principal value .",

    "<S> we calculate leading - order asymptotic formulae for the polynomials , with error bound inversely proportional to the number of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a number of asymptotic formulae that are valid in different overlapping regions whose union is the entire complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> we prove exponential convergence of zeros to the nodes of orthogonalization in saturated regions where the equilibrium measure achieves a certain upper constraint . </S>",
    "<S> two of the asymptotic formulae for the polynomials display features distinctive of discrete weights : one formula uniformly valid near the endpoints of the interval of accumulation of nodes where the upper constraint is active is written in terms of the euler gamma function , and another formula uniformly valid near generic band edges where the upper constraint becomes active are written in terms of both airy functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( by contrast @xmath0 appears alone at band edges where the lower constraint becomes active , as with continuous weights ) . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our methods with the krawtchouk polynomials and two families of polynomials belonging to the hahn class . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the equilibrium measure for the hahn weight .    </S>",
    "<S> universality of a number of statistics derived from so - called discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles ( discrete analogues of random matrix ensembles ) is established using asymptotics for the discrete orthogonal polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we establish the universal nature of the discrete sine and airy kernels as models for the correlation functions in certain regimes , and we prove convergence of distributions of extreme particles near band edges to the tracy - widom law . </S>",
    "<S> we apply these results to the problem of computing asymptotics of statistics for random rhombus tilings of a large hexagon . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is described in terms of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles corresponding to hahn - type polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , combining the universality theory with our specific calculations of the equilibrium measure for the hahn weights yields new error estimates and edge fluctuation phenomena for this statistical model .    </S>",
