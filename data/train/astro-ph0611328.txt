    "early - type galaxies are known to follow well defined empirical scaling laws relating their global observational properties , such as total luminosity @xmath1 , effective radius @xmath2 , and central velocity dispersion @xmath3 . among others we recall the faber & jackson ( 1976 , hereafter fj ) , kormendy ( 1977 ) , fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; hereafter fp ) , the color-@xmath3 ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ) , and the mg@xmath4 ( e.g. , guzman et al . 1992 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003c ) relations .",
    "in addition , it is now believed that all elliptical galaxies host a central supermassive black hole ( smbh ; e.g. , see de zeeuw 2001 ) , whose mass @xmath5 scales with the stellar mass @xmath6 and velocity dispersion @xmath3 of the host galaxy ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "clearly , these scaling relations provide invaluable information about the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies , and set stringent constraints to galaxy formation models .",
    "the two major formation models for ellipticals that have been proposed so far are the monolithic ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) , and the merging ( toomre 1977 ; white & frenk 1991 ) scenarios .",
    "each of them scores observational and theoretical successes and drawbacks ( e.g. , see ostriker 1980 , renzini 2006 ) .",
    "for instance , we list here three observational and theoretical evidences in favour of a fast and dissipative monolithic - like collapse .",
    "first , the observed color - magnitude and mg@xmath7-@xmath3 relations , and the increase of the @xmath8 $ ] ratio with @xmath3 in the stellar population of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , see jrgensen 1999 , thomas , greggio & bender 1999 saglia et al .",
    "2000 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003c , and references therein ) , suggest that star formation in massive ellipticals was not only more efficient than in low mass galaxies , but also that it was a faster process ( i.e. , completed before snia explosions take place ) , with the time scales of gas consumption and ejection shorter or comparable to the galaxy dynamical time ( e.g. , see matteucci 1994 , pipino & matteucci 2004 ) , and decreasing for increasing galaxy mass .",
    "second , structural and dynamical properties of ellipticals are well reproduced by cold dissipationless collapse , a process which is expected to dominate the last stages of highly dissipative collapses , in which the gas cooling time of the forming galaxy is shorter than its dynamical time , so that stars form ` in flight ' , and the subsequent dynamical evolution is a dissipationless collapse .",
    "it is now well established that the end - products of cold and phase - space clumpy collapses have projected density profiles well described by the @xmath9 de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) law , radially decreasing line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles , and radially increasing velocity anisotropy , in agreement with what observed in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , see van albada 1982 ; may & van albada 1984 ; mcglynn 1984 ; aguilar & merritt 1990 ; londrillo , messina & stiavelli 1991 ; udry 1993 ; hozumi , burkert , & fujiwara 2000 ; trenti , bertin & van albada 2005 ) .",
    "third , the current and remarkably succesful cosmological scenario for structure formation predicts that well defined scaling laws are imprinted in the dark matter halos ; in particular , the virial velocity dispersion of dm halos increases as @xmath10 .",
    "this because virialized dm halos are the _ collapse _ end - products of negative energy ( inhomogeneous ) density distributions , in which the absolute value of the binding energy per unit mass increases with the halo mass ( peebles 1980 ) . on the contrary , in a parabolic merging",
    "@xmath11 would not increase with halo mass .",
    "thus the observed scaling laws of elliptical galaxies could be originated by the fast collapse of inhomogeneous gas and star distributions in pre - existing dm halos , rather than by parabolic merging processes ( e.g. , see lanzoni et al .",
    "note that high resolution n - body simulations ( nipoti , londrillo & ciotti 2006 ) have shown that cold ( dissipationaless ) collapses in pre - existing dm halos nicely reproduce the weak homology of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , see caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ; prugniel & simien 1997 ; bertin , ciotti & del principe 2002 , hereafter bcd02 ; graham & guzmn 2003 ) and the central break radius in their surface brightness profile ( ferrarese et al .",
    "1994 ; lauer et al . 1995 ; graham et al . 2003 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the last point above is particularly puzzling because the available observations seem to indicate that mergers may happen in the life of elliptical galaxies , with dissipative ( wet ) mergers dominating at high redshift , and gas - free ( dry ) merging mainly affecting massive ellipticals at @xmath12 ( e.g. , see bell et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; van dokkum 2005 ; faber et al . 2005 ; conselice 2006 ) .",
    "this picture is also suggested by the available information on the star formation history of the universe and the redshift evolution of the quasar luminosity function ( see , e.g. , haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ; burkert & silk 2001 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; cavaliere & vittorini 2002 ; haiman , ciotti & ostriker 2004 ) . in addition",
    ", parabolic orbits seem to be quite relevant in the hierarchical merging picture ( e.g. , see benson 2005 ; khochfar & burkert 2006 ) . to get insights on this issue , in the present paper",
    "we will focus on the remarkable homogeneity and regularity of the family of early - type galaxies ( testified by their scaling laws ) , and we explore the consequences of galaxy merging on them",
    ".    the impact of dry merging on the scaling laws of early - type galaxies has been already investigated in several works ( e.g. , capelato , de carvalho & carlberg 1995 ; pentericci , ciotti & renzini 1996 ; haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ; ciotti & van albada 2001 , hereafter cva01 ; evstigneeva , reshetnikov & sotnikova 2002 ; nipoti , londrillo & ciotti 2003 , hereafter nlc03 ; gonzlez - garca & van albada 2003 ; dantas et al .",
    "2003 ; evstigneeva et al . 2004",
    "; boylan - kolchin , ma & quataert 2005 , 2006 ) . in particular , the simple approach of cva01 and the n - body simulations of nlc03 showed that repeated , parabolic merging of gas - free galaxies is unable at reproducing the observed scaling laws , because the merger - products are characterized by unrealistically large effective radius and mass - independent velocity dispersion ( see also shen et al .",
    "however , simple physical arguments show that gas dissipation should be able to mitigate the problems posed by dry merging to the explanation of the observed scaling laws ( e.g. , see cva01 ; kazantzidis et al .",
    "2006 ; robertson et al . 2006ab ; dekel & cox 2006 ) . unfortunately ,",
    "numerical simulations with gas dissipation are considerably more complicate than pure n - body simulations ( e.g. , see siz , domiguez - tenreiro & serna 2004 ; oorbe et al . 2005 , 2006 ;",
    "robertson et al .",
    "2006ab ) , and , in particular , very few of them have been done from realistic cosmological initial conditions ( e.g. , see naab et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) . for these reasons , by generalizing the approach presented in cva01 to the dissipative case , we further investigate with monte - carlo simulations the compatibility of galaxy merging with the formation and evolution of early - type galaxies , focusing in particular on 1 ) the effects of gas dissipation on the merger end - products ( wet merging ) , and 2 ) the effects of parabolic dry and wet merging on the scaling laws followed by elliptical galaxies in the local universe .",
    "we argue that parabolic merging of low - mass seed galaxies alone can not be at the origin of the scaling laws , even though wet mergers lead to early - type galaxies following the observed scaling laws better than the end products of dry merging .",
    "we also show that galaxy scaling laws , such as the fj , kormendy and fp relations , once in place , are robust against merging .",
    "thus , our results reinforce the idea that monolithic - like collapse at early times and subsequent merging could just represent the different phases of galaxy formation ( collapse ) and evolution ( merging , in addition to the aging of the stellar populations and related phenomena ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : models ] we derive the recursive equations describing the evolution of galaxy properties after dry and wet parabolic mergers , and in section 3 we discuss in detail the case of equal - mass merging . in section [ sec : simu ] we use the derived relations in monte - carlo investigations of merging of elliptical galaxy populations , and the main results are finally summarized and discussed in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this section we now derive from elementary physics arguments the relations between the properties of the progenitor galaxies and those of the merging end - products that will be used in the rest of the paper . for simplicity in the adopted scheme each elliptical is modeled as a non rotating , isotropic and spherically symmetric virialized system , characterized by a stellar mass @xmath6 , a gas mass @xmath13 , and a smbh mass @xmath14 ; from observations @xmath15 in @xmath16 spheroids ( magorrian 1998 ) . in our treatment",
    "we do not consider the presence of a dm halo , as it could be introduced just by rescaling the model stellar mass - to - light ratio if the dm density distribution is proportional to the stellar one , as discussed in the following paragraphs .",
    "the total energy of a galaxy is then given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the stellar kinetic energy , and @xmath19 is the gas internal energy ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the stellar 1-dimensional velocity dispersion , the boltzmann constant , the gas temperature , and the gas mean molecular mass , respectively . finally @xmath24 is the total gravitational energy of stars and gas ( we do not consider the negligible contribution of the central smbh ) .    under the simplifying assumption that the gas is spatially distributed as the stars ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) , then @xmath26 , and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the self - gravitational energy of the stellar component .",
    "furthermore , assuming that the gas is in equilibrium in the total gravitational field , from the jeans and the hydrostatic equations it results that @xmath29 , and from equations ( [ eq : kinstar])-([eq : intgas ] ) @xmath30 finally , from equations ( [ eq : w2])-([eq : ug ] ) and the virial theorem for the two - component system of stars + gas , the total galactic energy can be written in terms of the stellar energy and of the relative amount of gas as @xmath31 note that a dm halo of mass @xmath32 distributed as the stars would be easily considered in the present scheme by the addition of the new parameter @xmath33 in equations ( [ eq : w2])-([eq : etvt ] ) .",
    "the quantities introduced so far are not directly observables , and so in section 2.1 we will show how to relate the characteristic one - dimensional stellar velocity dispersion @xmath11 and the characteristic radius @xmath34 , defined as @xmath35 @xmath36 to the galaxy effective radius @xmath2 and central projected velocity dispersion @xmath3 and @xmath34 in equations ( [ eq : tstar ] ) and ( [ eq : wstar ] ) coincide with the virial velocity dispersion and the virial radius of the star@xmath37gas system",
    ". this would not be true in a system where @xmath38 . ] .",
    "we now focus on the parabolic merging of two galaxies , so that the total energy of the system is the sum of the internal potential and kinetic energies of the two progenitor galaxies ; we also assume that no mass is lost in the process . during the merging , as a consequence of gas dissipation",
    ", a fraction @xmath39 of the available gas mass is converted into stars , and the stellar mass balance equation is @xmath40 furthermore , a new smbh forms by the coalescence of the two central bhs and a fraction @xmath41 of the available gas is accreted on it , leading to a bh of final mass @xmath42 the free parameter @xmath43 describes how much bh rest mass is radiated as gravitational waves during the bh coalescence : @xmath44 corresponds to the classical merging case ( no gravitational radiation ) , while @xmath45 to the maximally radiative case for non - rotating bhs . note that in equation ( [ eq : mbh ] ) it is implicitly assumed that first @xmath46 and @xmath47 merge , and then the gas is accreted on the new bh ; the other extreme case would be that of gas accretion followed by merging ( e.g. , see hughes & blandford 2003 ) .",
    "of course , if @xmath44 there is no difference in the final mass ; we anticipate that in the monte - carlo simulations described in section [ sec : simu ] we explored both cases , finding not significative differences . as a consequence of star formation and bh accretion , the gas mass balance equation is @xmath48 which implies that @xmath49 . thus , the gas - to - star mass ratio after the merger and the new magorrian coefficient are given by @xmath50 while @xmath51 respectively .",
    "note that if @xmath44 and @xmath52 , the proportionality coefficient @xmath53 remains unchanged after the merging ; also note that the scheme above is generalizable by allowing for different values of @xmath54 and @xmath39 in the two progenitor galaxies , but for simplicity in this paper we assume @xmath54 and @xmath39 fixed .    in order to describe the effects on @xmath34 and @xmath11 of the radiative energy losses associated with gas dissipation",
    ", a fraction @xmath55 of the gas internal energy @xmath56 of each progenitor is subtracted from the total energy budget of the merger - product , consistently with the previous assumptions of the resulting total gas mass and of the internal energy @xmath57 would be dissipated , where @xmath58 .",
    "the two schemes lead to identical predictions when @xmath59 , or , for @xmath60 , when @xmath61 . ] .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ eq : ug ] ) , the final total energy of the remnant is @xmath62 identity ( [ eq : etvt ] ) with the new total energy @xmath63 , the new mass ratio @xmath64 and the new total stellar mass @xmath6 are given by equations ( [ eq : ep ] ) , ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , and ( [ eq : mstar ] ) , respectively .",
    "simple algebra shows that for the new galaxy @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 and a similar expression holds for @xmath68 . in a dry ( @xmath69 ) merging @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 i.e. , the virial velocity dispersion of the merger - product can not be larger than the maximum velocity dispersion of the progenitors ( the @xmath72 and @xmath69 case also describes the situation in which the gaseous component is replaced by a dm halo ) .",
    "instead , @xmath73 in case of wet ( @xmath74 ) merging , and the resulting @xmath11 is larger than in the dry case , possibly larger than the maximum velocity dispersion of the progenitors .",
    "a similar argument shows that in presence of gas dissipation the new @xmath34 increases less than in the dry case .",
    "note that the conclusions of this preparatory analysis are obtained under the hypothesis of parabolic merging .",
    "if mergers involve galaxies on bound orbits , the additional negative energy term in equation ( [ eq : ep ] ) would lead to an increase of @xmath11 also in equal - mass dry mergers .",
    "the analysis of this case , and the question of how much fine - tuned the properties of the progenitor galaxies should be with their binding orbital energy in order to reproduce the scaling laws , are not further discussed in this paper ( e.g. , see boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; almeida , baugh & lacey 2006 ) .",
    "so far the discussion involved galaxy virial properties only .",
    "however , galaxy scaling laws relate observational quantities such as total luminosity @xmath1 , central projected velocity dispersion @xmath3 ( luminosity averaged over some aperture ) , and circularized effective radius @xmath2 . for example , in this paper we compare our models with the fj ( @xmath75 , rms[@xmath76=0.075 ) , kormendy ( @xmath77 , rms[@xmath78=0.1 ) , and edge - on fp ( @xmath79 , rms[@xmath80= 0.049 $ ] ) relations in the z - band as given by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) ; we also consider the @xmath0 relation ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "an important issue of the present analysis is then how to map , for each galaxy model , the two sets @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    because we are not using @xmath83-body simulations  where under the assumption of a constant mass - to - light ratio @xmath84 the relation between virial and `` observed '' properties",
    "is known ( e.g. , see nlc03 )  we adopt a conservative approach , and we assume a mass - dependent structural _ weak homology _ of our galaxies compatible with the fp tilt ( e.g. , see bcd02 ) : in practice , we `` force '' the models to stay on the edge - on fp , and then we check if and how the fj and kormendy relations are preserved . this assumption is well founded , both observationally and theoretically . in fact , it is known that the edge - on fp is characterized by a tilt , i.e. , by a systematic trend of the ratio between the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath84 and the virial parameter @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and identity above holds for the general expression of the edge - on fp @xmath88 ( curiously , we note that while in the b - band all the tilt depends on luminosity ( bcd02 ) , in the present case and in the k - band it is almost due only to @xmath2 , with @xmath89 ( e.g. , see treu 2001 ) .",
    "unfortunately , a definite answer about the origin and the physical driving parameter(s ) of the fp tilt is still missing .",
    "it is however known that structural weak homology could be able to produce the whole ( or a large part of ) the fp tilt . in particular , sersic ( 1968 )",
    "models provide a remarkably good description of the light - profiles of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , see caon et al .",
    "1993 , graham & colless 1997 ) , with the sersic index @xmath90 increasing with galaxy luminosity and spanning the range of values required by equation ( 20 ) to reproduce the fp tilt ( e.g. , see ciotti , lanzoni & renzini 1996 , ciotti & lanzoni 1997 , bcd02 ) .",
    "note that an increase of @xmath90 with galaxy mass was also found in @xmath83-body simulations of major mergers ( nlc03 ) .",
    "thus , in this paper we introduce weak homology by assuming that for a galaxy characterized by the pair @xmath91 , the observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 are given by @xmath92 and @xmath93 the two relations above , where @xmath3 is the luminosity wheighted projected velocity dispersion within @xmath94 , hold with very good accuracy for one - component , isotropic sersic models with @xmath95 ( ciotti 1991 , ciotti & lanzoni 1997 , ciotti & bertin 1999 ) . from equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) the corresponding virial coefficient @xmath96 is easily found ( see also cbd02 ) .",
    "how a specific value of @xmath90 is assigned to a given galaxy model is described in the following sections .      in order to illustrate the effect of repeated dry and wet mergers on a population of elliptical galaxies , in this section we start our analysis presenting the idealized case of a merging hierarchy of equal mass spheroids , extending the analysis of cva01 to the dissipative case . the seed galaxies",
    "( zeroth - order generation ) are identical systems characterized by a stellar mass @xmath97 , a gas mass @xmath98 , a central bh mass @xmath99 , a virial radius @xmath100 , and a virial velocity dispersion @xmath101 .",
    "a galaxy of the @xmath102-th generation is the merger - product of two galaxies of @xmath103-th generation , so the equations ( [ eq : mstar])-([eq : sigv ] ) can be written in recursive form .",
    "the solution of the gas mass equation ( [ eq : mgas ] ) , that in the present case reads @xmath104 , is @xmath105 so that for @xmath106 the gas mass is a steadily decreasing quantity along the merging hierarchy .",
    "the stellar mass equation ( [ eq : mstar ] ) becomes @xmath107 , and from equation ( [ eq : mgasi ] ) we obtain @xmath108 while the gas - to - star mass fraction at stage @xmath102 is given by @xmath109 at variance with @xmath110 , @xmath111 is a decreasing function of @xmath102 independently of the value of @xmath112 . in fig.[fig : alpimuifei ] we show the evolution of @xmath111 along sequences of ten equal - mass mergers , starting from gas - dominated seed galaxies ( @xmath113 ) and for different values of @xmath39 ( with @xmath114 ) : according to equation ( [ eq : mstari ] ) the stellar mass increases by a factor @xmath115 for @xmath69 and of @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "the horizontal solid line @xmath118 represents the dry merging case ( @xmath69 ; note that we call `` wet '' a merging in which gas dissipation is active : a gas rich merger with @xmath69 is in practice a dry merger ) .",
    "when significant dissipation is present , @xmath111 dramatically decreases in the first mergers for the combined effects of gas depletion and the associated stellar mass increase . only for values of @xmath39 as low as @xmath119 a more gentle evolution is produced .",
    "the bh mass evolution equation ( [ eq : mbh ] ) , @xmath120 , is solved with the aid of equation ( [ eq : mgasi ] ) and reads @xmath121 the explicit formula of the bh - to - star mass ratio @xmath122 ( equation [ [ eq : mu ] ] ) can be derived from equation ( [ eq : mstari ] ) and the equation above .",
    "the evolution of @xmath122 is shown in the middle panel of fig.[fig : alpimuifei ] for the maximally radiative case @xmath45 and for fixed @xmath123 : while the magorrian relation is preserved by construction in case of classical bh merging ( @xmath44 , solid horizontal line ) , in the extreme ( @xmath45 ) case @xmath122 decreases for increasing galaxy mass , even though fresh gas is added to the bh at each merging in proportion to the stellar mass increase .",
    "thus , in order to preserve the magorrian relation when @xmath124 , an increasing fraction @xmath41 of the available gas must be accreted on the bh as the merging hierarchy proceeds , increasing the agn activity .",
    "when the progenitor spheroids are gas rich , high values of @xmath39 may initially compensate the decrease of @xmath53 due to gravitational radiation ; however , after a few mergers these galaxies run out of gas , and the final values of @xmath53 are even lower than in the less dissipative @xmath125 case .    from equations ( [ eq : sigp ] ) and ( [ eq : rp ] ) we finally obtain the relations between the virial velocity dispersion and the virial radius of the progenitors and of the new galaxy : @xmath126 @xmath127 ^ 2\\over ( 1+\\alpha_{i-1})\\left[1+\\alpha_{i-1}+\\eta(1+f)\\alpha_{i-1}\\right]}. \\label{eq : rvi}\\ ] ]    as expected , @xmath11 is larger ( and @xmath34 is smaller ) in the wet than in the dry merging case : for example , @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the limit of @xmath130 . figure",
    "[ fig : alpimuifei ] shows how gas dissipation may produce a non - monothonic behavior of the quantity @xmath131 , which is often considered an estimate of the phase - space density . in particular ,",
    "while @xmath132 decreases as @xmath133 in equal mass dry merging , in highly dissipative gas rich mergers the increase of @xmath134 dominates over the increase of @xmath135 , and @xmath136 . from the previous formula",
    "one would then conclude that an increase of the phase - space density is limited to exceptionally gas rich mergers , but this is not correct .",
    "in fact @xmath137 is based on virial quantities , that by their nature refer to global scales : an increase of the phase - space density in the galactic central regions can be produced by the _",
    "localized _ dissipation of a smaller amount of gas .    in fig.[fig : eqm_screl ] we plot the representative points of the same models of fig.[fig : alpimuifei ] in the @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 planes . these plots , under the assumption of the same stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath84 for all models ,",
    "correspond to the fj ( panel a ) , kormendy ( panel b ) , and fp ( panel c ) planes .",
    "the assumption of a constant value for @xmath84 is made less severe by the comparing the models to the observed scaling laws in the z - band ( dashed lines ) , where metallicity effects on @xmath84 are reduced with respect to bluer wavelenghts .",
    "merging induced structural weak homology is imposed by assuming that the seed galaxies are sersic @xmath142 models in accordance with the observed light profiles of low - luminosity ellipticals , and that @xmath90 increases by 1 in each merging , as shown by numerical simulations ( nlc03 ) . in this way",
    ", the final range of values spanned by @xmath90 is between 2 and 12 , consistently with observations . in practice , for assigned values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the seed galaxies , from equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) with @xmath142 we obtain their @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we also assume that the seed galaxies are placed at the lower end of the various scaling laws represented in fig .",
    "2 . the equal mass merging formula ( 27)-(28 )",
    "are then applied , and the new virial radius and velocity dispersion are mapped in the corresponding @xmath2 and @xmath3 again from equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) with @xmath143 , and so on .    from fig.2c",
    "it is apparent how the fp tilt is well reproduced by the models corresponding to dry mergers ( solid dots ) .",
    "the adopted prescription for weak homology is relevant here : in fact , it is easy to prove that if the models were plotted by using @xmath34 and @xmath11 instead of the fiducial @xmath144 and @xmath3 , they would be placed along a line of slope @xmath145 ( for a surface - brightness coefficient @xmath146 in the fp expression ) instead of 1 . figure 2c also shows that highly dissipative wet mergers are initially displaced from the fp , but they again move along lines almost parallel to the edge - on fp as soon as a large fraction of gas is converted into stars .",
    "these simple considerations indicate that the final position of a galaxy in the fp space as a consequence of merging is sensitive to the physical processes involved , as already discussed by bender , burstein & faber ( 1993 ) . at variance with the edge - on fp , neither the fj nor the kormendy relations",
    "are reproduced : in particular , while velocity dispersions are too low , effective radii are too large .",
    "again , note that this inconsistency would be exacerbated when plotting @xmath34 and @xmath11 : for example , solid dots in fig.[fig : eqm_screl]a would be aligned on a horizontal line , while in fig.[fig : eqm_screl]b they would be placed on the line @xmath147 . from fig.[fig : eqm_screl]d it is finally apparent how the @xmath0 relation is also failed , expecially in the classical merging case .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath45 the mass loss due to emission of gravitational waves maintains the bh mass nearer to the observed relations the the classical merging case .",
    "in general , wet mergers are in better agreement with the fj and kormendy relations than dry mergers ( in a way dependent on the specific value of @xmath39 ) , due to the shrinking of @xmath34 and the increase of @xmath11 . unfortunately , in the present framework we can not evaluate the galaxy non - homology induced by gas dissipation , that can be investigated only with n - body@xmath37gas numerical simulations such those of robertson et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , and so weak homology is just imposed with the same prescription as for dry mergers . in any case , the preliminary analysis of this section is consistent with the idea that the fj and kormendy relations are stronger tests for merging than the edge - on fp , as already clearly shown by numerical simulations ( e.g. , see nlc03 ; boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "in this section we extend the previous investigation to the study of the effects of repeated parabolic merging on a _ population _ of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the merging spheroids are extracted by means of monte - carlo simulations from different samples of seed galaxies , and the properties of the resulting galaxies are determined by using the relations derived in section [ sec : models ] .",
    "the motivation for these simulations is the fact that equal - mass merging maximizes ( minimizes ) the effects on the radius ( velocity dispersion ) of the resulting objects , while mergers of galaxies spanning a substantial range of masses , sizes and velocity disperions not only are more realistic , but also could lead to less dramatic effects on the scaling relations .    in particular , we focus on two schemes designed to explore and quantify the impact of dry and wet merging on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies . in the first scheme the seed galaxies span only a narrow mass range ( a factor of @xmath148 )",
    ": in this case we then study whether massive ellipticals and the observed scaling relations can be _ produced _ by repeated mergers of low - mass spheroidal systems . in the second scheme the seed ellipticals follow the observed scaling relations over their whole observed mass range ( @xmath115 ) , and so we explore whether repeated merging events preserve or destroy these relations . for sake of completeness , and also to check the robustness of the results obtained with the monte - carlo simulations , we finally conduct a third set of experiments in which the merging histories are described by press & schechter ( 1974 ) merger trees .    how the mass , virial radius and velocity dispersion of the seed galaxies , as well as their effective radius and central velocity dispersion , are assigned in each experiment is described in the corresponding sections . in all cases",
    ", however , the initial mass of the smbh obeys the magorrian relation with @xmath149 .      in this first scheme ,",
    "once two spheroids are extracted from the initial population ( made of 1000 objects ) , they are merged together , and the properties of the merger end - product are computed as described in section [ sec : models ] .",
    "the two progenitors are then removed from the seed galaxy population , while the new object is added to it ; the procedure is repeated until the largest produced galaxies are @xmath150 times more massive than the smallest seed galaxy in the original sample .",
    "this may require up to 10 - 12 mergers , @xmath1517 - 10 of which being major mergers ( i.e. , merging in which the stellar mass ratio of the progenitors is in the range @xmath152 ; e.g. , see kauffmann , guiderdoni & white 1994 ) .",
    "the initial population of seed galaxies is obtained by random extraction ( with the von neumann rejection technique ) of the stellar mass @xmath6 from the sdss z - band galaxy luminosity function ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) , under the assumption of constant stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath84 .",
    "finally , the mass ratio of the most massive to the less massive galaxy in the sample is taken to be 5 . in case of wet mergers ,",
    "the _ total _",
    "( stars+gas ) mass is the quantity which is extracted . for each galaxy mass ,",
    "the corresponding central velocity dispersion @xmath3 is fixed according to the z - band fj , and the effective radius @xmath2 is assigned from the fp in the z - band ( bernardi et al .",
    "2003a , b ) . due to the restricted mass range",
    ", all the galaxies are assumed to be @xmath142 sersic models , and so their virial radius @xmath34 and virial velocity dispersion @xmath11 can be easily calculated .",
    "we then apply the rule that in major mergers the sersic index of the resulting galaxy is @xmath153 , where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the sersic indices of the progenitors . in minor mergers ,",
    "the sersic index instead keeps the same value of the more massive galaxy . note",
    "that this is a quite conservative assumption , because in nlc03 it was found that in head - on minor mergers @xmath90 actually _ decreases _ , producing galaxies that fall outside the edge - on fp .",
    "figures [ fig : dry_smallm ] and [ fig : wet_smallm ] show the results in the cases of dry ( @xmath156 ) and dissipative gas rich ( @xmath157 ) parabolic merging , respectively ; the mass interval spanned by the progenitors is indicated by the two vertical ticks , the end - product positions are represented by the dots , and the observed scaling laws are represented by the dotted lines .",
    "figure [ fig : dry_smallm ] reveals that massive ellipticals can not be formed by parabolic dry mergers of low - mass spheroids only , because they would be characterized by exceedingly large @xmath2 and almost mass independent @xmath3 , in agreement with the results of cva01 and nlc03 , and with the conclusions of section [ sec : models ] . in fact , when galaxies reach a mass @xmath158 times larger than that of the largest seed galaxies , all the seed galaxy population can be considered made by equal mass objects , and the considerations of section 2.2 apply .",
    "figure [ fig : wet_smallm ] shows the results in the case of wet merging of gas dominated ( @xmath113 ) galaxies . as expected , mergers with gas dissipation produce more realistic objects than dry mergings and , remarkably , the observed scaling laws are satisfied ( even though with a large scatter ) by the new galaxies , up to a mass increase of a factor of @xmath159 with respect to the smallest seed galaxies . however , new galaxies characterized by a mass increase factor @xmath160 are mainly formed by mergers of gas poor galaxies that already experienced several mergers , and so they deviate from the observed scaling laws as the galaxies in fig.[fig : dry_smallm ] .",
    "more quantitatively , the models plotted in fig.[fig : dry_smallm ] deviate from the observed @xmath161 and fj relations by more than @xmath162 when their ( logarithmic ) mass increase is @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively , the larger mass value allowed by the fj being due to its larger scatter .",
    "the mean gas - to - star mass ratio for the deviating models is @xmath165 ( even though several models with a lower @xmath64 are still consistent with the two relations considered ) .",
    "quite obviously , these values depend on the initial amount of gas : for example , when starting with @xmath166 the models are incompatible with the observed @xmath161 for a logarithmic increase of the stellar mass of @xmath167 , and for @xmath168 .",
    "we note , however , that the populated region in the edge - on fp is reduced for increasing @xmath169 , as can be seen by comparing the model distributions in figs .  3 and 4 .",
    "this first exploration therefore reveals that parabolic merging of low mass galaxies only is unable to produce elliptical galaxies obeying the observed scaling laws , even when allowing for structural weak homology in a way consistent with the edge - on fp .",
    "however gas dissipation plays an important role in gas rich merging and remarkably the resulting elliptical galaxies appear to be distributed as the observed scaling relations , as far as enough gas is available .",
    "quite obviously , the problem of the compatibility of the properties of such merger - products with other key observations , such as the color - magnitude and the metallicity - velocity dispersion relations , and the increasing age of the spheroids with their mass ( e.g. , see renzini 2006 ; gallazzi et al .",
    "2006 ) can not be addressed in the framework of this paper .      in the second scheme ,",
    "the masses of the seed galaxies span the full range covered by ordinary ellipticals ( @xmath115 ) , and their characteristic size and velocity dispersion follow the observed scaling relations . the mass , effective radius , and central velocity disperion of each seed galaxy are assigned as described in section 3.1 ; however , due to the large mass range spanned in the present case , the models can not be caracterized by the same value of the sersic index , if they are placed on the edge - on fp .",
    "for this reason a sersic index is assigned to each seed galaxy by solving for @xmath90 the equation @xmath170 ; in turn , from the knowledge of @xmath90 we obtain the values of @xmath34 and @xmath11 needed in the merging scheme . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our study to major mergers only , increasing by 1 the larger sersic index characterizing each merging pair .",
    "finally , for consistency with the imposed scaling laws ( which hold for present - day gas poor spheroids ) , we focus on dry merging only . in this section",
    "we then study the effect of merging on already established scaling laws .    in practice , once a galaxy is chosen , a second galaxy with a mass ratio to the first in the range @xmath152 is extracted from the seed population , and then the two galaxies are merged . as in the other cases ,",
    "the intrinsic galaxy properties are transformed into their `` observational '' counterparts by using equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) .",
    "the procedure is repeated by selecting a third galaxy from the initial population , and so on for a total of 6 major mergers .",
    "the positions in the observational planes of 1000 galaxies ( at all stages of the merging hyerarchy ) are shown in fig.[fig : dry_allm ] .",
    "the main result is that now , at variance with the narrow mass range experiments , the scaling laws remain almost unaffected by the merging , both in their slope and scatter . in particular , note how the @xmath5-@xmath3 relation ( with @xmath45 ) is preserved , even though we are in dry merging regime .",
    "the only detectable deviations from the observed scaling laws , for the same reasons already discussed in section [ sec : narrow ] , are found for ellipticals with masses larger than the most massive galaxies in the original sample ( marked by the two vertical ticks in fig.[fig : dry_allm ] ) .",
    "why mergers do preserve so well the scaling relations ?",
    "the reason is simple : by construction in a population of galaxies spanning the whole mass range observed today and distributed according to the observed scaling laws , mergers in general involve a `` regular '' elliptical , with realistic values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these mergings act as a `` thermostat '' , maintaining values of @xmath2 in the observed range and increasing the virial velocity dispersion , thus contributing to preserve the scaling laws .",
    "only when the produced galaxies are so massive that no regular galaxies of comparable mass are available , the new merger products deviate more and more from the scaling laws . this behavior becomes extreme in the case of repeated mergers in a galaxy population spanning a restricted mass range , as discussed in section [ sec : narrow ] .",
    "thus , our analysis confirm that while the elliptical galaxy scaling laws ( and so elliptical galaxies ) can not be produced by the merging of low mass spheroids only ( as already pointed out by e.g. , cva01 , nlc03 , evstigneeva et al .",
    "2004 ) , these relations once established by some other mechanism , are robust against merging .      we conclude our study by presenting a set of numerical experiments aimed at investigating the evolution of galaxies with a merging history obtained from the extended press & schechter ( 1974 ) formalism in a standard @xmath171cdm cosmology .",
    "the details of the realization of the merger trees are given in volonteri , haardt & madau ( 2003 ) , while the ensemble from which they have been extracted is in accordance with the jenkins ( 2001 ) modified p&s formula .",
    "in particular , we selected a set of 20 merger trees tracing the merger history , from @xmath172 to @xmath16 , of a halo with mass @xmath173 at present time .",
    "since the mass resolution in the merger tree scales as @xmath174 , it follows that @xmath175 is always @xmath176% of the main halo mass in the merger hierarchy .",
    "this wide range of masses allows for both minor and major mergers in the tree at all redshifts . that the _ statistical _ discrepancies between the dm function derived from the press & schechter formalism and numerical simulations ( e.g. , jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ) are not the present context , where we focus on the growth of a in practice , we applied at each merging event in a given tree the relations derived in section [ sec : models ] , both for the dry and the wet ( @xmath157 ) cases , for a total of 40 simulations .",
    "the virial radius @xmath34 of each seed halo ( that we arbitrarily identify with a galaxy ) is now defined as the radius of the sphere characterized by mean mass density @xmath177 ( where @xmath178 is the critical density for closure at redshift @xmath179 , and @xmath180 is the density contrast at virialization ( eke , navarro , & frenk 1998 ) . ] ) .",
    "this definition of virial radius is not - strictly speaking - identical to the standard dynamical relation ( [ eq : wstar ] ) .",
    "however , in lanzoni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) it was shown that the two definitions of @xmath34 are in nice agreement , and so we also define the halo ( galaxy ) virial velocity dispersion from the virial theorem @xmath181 .",
    "the properties of the merger end - product are determined according to the dry or wet relations , while those of the secondary galaxy involved in each subsequent event follow the cosmological virial relations .",
    "the weak homology trend is added to the models by assigning a sersic index @xmath142 to the main halo at @xmath172 ( which is assumed to be placed on the reference scaling laws ) , and increasing it by 1 in each major merger ; in minor mergers @xmath90 is maintained constant .    for simplicity , in fig.6",
    "we show the fj , kormendy and fp planes for just two out of the 40 simulations , being the behavior of galaxy models in all the merger trees almost identical .",
    "note that at variance with figs.3,4 , and 5 , here the points constitute an evolutionary sequence , representing the successive positions of the main halo during its mass accretion history . from the comparison with figs.[fig : dry_smallm ] and [ fig : wet_smallm ] it is apparent that deviations from the slope of the fj and kormendy relations are less strong than in the previous cases , while the evolutionary tracks of the growing halos move parallel to the edge - on fp plane .",
    "the fact that also in the merger tree exploration the slopes of the fj , kormendy , and fp relations are preserved is not surprising , as it is easily explained when combining the results of previous sections with the fact that now the `` galaxies '' involved in the mergings are provided by the cosmological setting , in which @xmath182 .",
    "thus , the determinant factor of success is again the availability of galaxies with a virial radius and velocity dispersion increasing with the halo mass , a property that can not be produced by parabolic mergings of small systems only , but it is the natural consequence of the substantially different phenomenon of negative energy collapses ( see introduction ) .    note that the accordance with observations would be in fact even better than the results shown in fig .",
    "according to the hierarchical merging picture , the number of mergers an elliptical galaxy experiences in its lifetime ( efficient mergers , i.e. , those with time scales shorter than the hubble time ) is much smaller than the number of halo mergers in a cosmological merger tree , as only a small fraction ( @xmath183 ) of them leads to galaxy mergers , once the finite time needed for merging is taken into account ( see fig.[fig : effmerg ] ) .",
    "in fact , dynamical friction appears to be very efficient ( i.e. , with a decay timescale shorter than the hubble time ) only for mergers with a mass ratio of the progenitors @xmath184 ( taffoni et al .",
    "2003 ) , while satellites in intermediate mass ratio ( @xmath185 ) suffer severe mass losses by the tidal perturbations induced by the gravitational field of the primary halo , and this progressive mass loss further increases the decay time .",
    "the lightest satellites are almost unaffected by orbital decay , so they survive and keep orbiting on rather circular , peripheral orbits .",
    "with the aid of a scheme based on very simple physical arguments we investigated the influence of dry and wet merging on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies , focusing on the origin and robustness of some of their scaling laws .",
    "in particular , by using analytical arguments and numerical simulations we showed that massive elliptical galaxies can not be formed by ( parabolic ) merging of low mass spheroidal galaxies , even in presence of substantial gas dissipation , and allowing for the helpful effects of structural weak homology . however the observed scaling laws of elliptical galaxies , once established by galaxy formation , are robust against merging . more specifically , our findings can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) parabolic dry merging in a population of low mass spheroids leads to massive ellipticals that can not be simultaneously placed on the kormendy , fj and edge - on fp relations .",
    "for example , forcing the end - products to stay on the edge - on fp , the fj and kormendy relations are failed by massive galaxies , with deviations increasing with galaxy mass .",
    "this behavior was predicted in cva01 and confirmed by high resolution numerical simulations ( nlc03 , boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "for example boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in a series of dissipationless merging simulations of galaxies in cosmologically motivated orbits , found that the merging end - products , while preserving the edge - on view of the fp , can present significant differences in the fj and kormendy relations .",
    "this because the variations in the resulting @xmath186 are compensated by corresponding variations in the @xmath187 relation , so that the _ projections _ of the fp - but not the edge - on fp itself - should provide a powerful way to investigate the assembly history of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "\\2 ) parabolic wet merging in the same population of low mass progenitors lead to galaxies in much better agreement with the observed scaling relations , as long as enough gas for dissipation is available . in particular , the resulting @xmath5-@xmath3 relation is in better agreement with the observed one , also in the case of significant mass loss ( via gravitational waves ) of the coalescing bhs .",
    "significant deviations from the observed scaling laws are however expected for massive galaxies .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by sophisticated @xmath83-body plus hydrodynamical simulations of merging of disk galaxies .",
    "for example , kazantzidis et al . (",
    "2005 ) found that merging disk galaxies constructed to obey the @xmath161 relation move relative to it depending on whether they undergo a dissipational or dissipationless merger .",
    "in particular , remnants of dry mergings tend to move away from the mean relation , showing the role of gas - poor mergers as a possible source of scatter .",
    "in addition , robertson et al ( 2006b ) studied the development of the @xmath161 over cosmic time with a large set of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers that include star formation and feedback from the growth of the central bh , and found that the @xmath161 relation is created through coupled bh and spheroid growth ( via star formation ) in galaxy mergers .",
    "\\3 ) parabolic dry mergers in a population of galaxies following the observed scaling laws over the full mass range populated today by stellar spheroids ( or following the scaling laws of dark matter halos predicted by the current cosmological scenario ) , preserve the kormendy , fj , and edge - on fp remarkably well .",
    "the reason of this behavior is rooted in the availability in the merger population of galaxies with velocity dispersion increasing with galaxy mass",
    ". remarkably , robertson et al . ( 2006a ) found evidences that dry merging of spheroidal galaxies at low redshift is expected to maintain the fp relation _ imprinted by gas - rich merging during the epoch of rapid spheroid and central bh growth at high redshift _",
    ", when the progenitors were characterized by gas fractions @xmath188 and efficient gas cooling was allowed in the simulations .",
    "thus , points 1 ) and 2 ) above suggest that ellipticals can not be originated by parabolic merging of low mass spheroids only , even in presence of substantial gas dissipation .",
    "in addition , point 3 ) , when considered together the cosmologically imprinted scaling laws of dark matter halos , and the several appealing features of dissipationless collapse end - products ( see introduction ) , support the idea that elliptical galaxies formed in a process similar to the monolithic collapse , even though their structural and dynamical properties are compatible with a limited number of dry mergers ( we note that the same conclusion has been reached also from the study of color profiles in early - type galaxies , as described in wu et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the possibility that monolithic collapse and successive merging are just the leading physical processes at different times in galaxy evolution , and that they are both important for galaxy formation , is perhaps indicated also by a `` contradictory '' and often overlooked peculiarity of massive ellipticals in fact , while the kormendy relation dictates that the mean stellar density of galaxies decreases for increasing galaxy mass ( a natural result of parabolic dry merging ) , the normalized light profiles of elliptical galaxies becomes steeper and their metallicity increases at increasing galaxy mass ( as expected in case of significant gas dissipation ) .",
    "thus , the present - day light profiles of ellipticals could represent the fossil evidence of the impact of both the processes ; quite obviously , this problem can not be addressed in the framework adopted in this paper .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend the robertson et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and naab et al .",
    "( 2006 ) analysis to the study of dissipative collapses in cosmologically motivated dark matter halos , thus extending the investigation of nipoti et al .",

    "<S> with the aid of a simple yet robust approach we investigate the influence of dissipationless and dissipative merging on galaxy structure , and the consequent effects on the scaling laws followed by elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that ellipticals can not be originated by parabolic merging of low mass spheroids only , even in presence of substantial gas dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also found that scaling laws such as the faber - jackson , kormendy , fundamental plane , and the @xmath0 relations , when considered over the whole mass range spanned by ellipticals in the local universe , are robust against merging . we conclude that galaxy scaling laws , possibly established at high redshift by the fast collapse in pre - existing dark matter halos of gas rich and clumpy stellar distributions , are compatible with a ( small ) number of galaxy mergers at lower redshift . </S>"
