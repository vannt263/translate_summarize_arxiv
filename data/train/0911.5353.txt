    "a magnetization curling occurs in magnetic particles of nanoscale due to the dipole - dipole interaction . in particular , the vortex state is realized in a disk shaped particle , where the magnetization becomes circular lying in the disk plane in the main part of the sample , which possesses a flux - closure state . at the disk center",
    "there appears an out - of - plane magnetization structure ( the vortex core , typically from 10 nm @xcite to 23 nm @xcite ) due to the dominant role of the exchange interaction inside the core .",
    "@xcite the vortex state of magnetic nanodots has drawn much attention because it could be used for high - density magnetic storage and miniature sensors .",

    "the mechanism of the vortex switching is of general nature ; it is essentially the same in all systems where the switching was observed .",
    "@xcite there are two main stages of the switching process : ( i ) at the first stage of the process the vortex structure is excited by the pumping , leading to the creation of an out  of  plane dip with opposite sign nearby the vortex .",
    "the appearance of such a deformation is confirmed experimentally .",
    "@xcite ( ii ) at the second stage , when the dip amplitude reaches the maximum possible value , there appears a vortex ",
    "antivortex pair from the dip structure .",
    "the further dynamics is accompanied by the annihilation of the original vortex with the new antivortex , leading effectively to the switching of the vortex polarity ; the dynamics of this three body problem can be described analytically .",
    "@xcite while the second stage is well understood , the physical picture of the first stage of the switching process , which is a dip creation , is still not clear .",
    "the aim of the current study is to develop a theory of the dip creation , which is a key moment in the vortex switching process .",
    "the dip always appears as a nonlinear regime of one of the magnon modes . in most studies",
    "the dip appears by exciting a low frequency gyromode , which corresponds to the azimuthal quantum number @xmath2 ; the frequency of this mode @xmath3 lies in the sub ghz range .",
    "excitation of the gyromode always leads to a macrospopic motion of the vortex as a whole ; moreover the vortex has to reach some critical velocity @xmath4 of about 300 m / s in order to switch its polarity @xcite .",
