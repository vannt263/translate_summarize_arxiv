    "the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation are theoretically very well understood , allowing precise and unambiguous predictions for a given cosmological model  @xcite .",
    "consequently , measurement of cmb anisotropy has spearheaded the remarkable transition of cosmology into a precision science .",
    "the transition has also seen the emergence of data analysis of large complex data sets as an important and challenging component of research in cosmology .",
    "increasingly sensitive , high resolution , measurements over large regions of the sky pose a stiff challenge for current analysis techniques to realize the full potential of precise determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "the analysis techniques must not only be computationally fast to contend with the huge size of the data , but , the higher sensitivity also limits the simplifying assumptions that can be then invoked to achieve the desired speed without compromising the final precision goals .",
    "there is a worldwide effort to push the boundary of this inherent compromise faced by the current cmb experiments that measure the anisotropy in the cmb temperature and its polarization .",
    "accurate estimation of the angular power spectrum , @xmath2 , is arguably the foremost concern of most cmb experiments .",
    "the extensive literature on this topic has been summarized in literature  @xcite . for gaussian , statistically isotropic cmb sky , the @xmath0 that corresponds to the covariance that maximizes the multivariate gaussian pdf of the temperature map",
    ", @xmath3 is the maximum likelihood ( ml ) solution .",
    "different ml estimators have been proposed and implemented on cmb data of small and modest sizes  @xcite .",
    "while it is desirable to use optimal estimators of @xmath0 that obtain ( or iterate toward ) the ml solution for the given data , these methods are usually limited by the computational expense of matrix inversion that scales as @xmath4 with data size @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "various strategies for speeding up ml estimation have been proposed , such as , exploiting the symmetries of the scan strategy  @xcite , using hierarchical decomposition  @xcite , iterative multi - grid method  @xcite , etc .",
    "variants employing linear combinations of @xmath6 such as @xmath7 on set of rings in the sky can alleviate the computational demands in special cases  @xcite .",
    "other promising ` exact ' power estimation methods have been recently proposed  @xcite .",
    "however there also exist computationally rapid , sub - optimal estimators of @xmath0 . exploiting the fast spherical harmonic transform ( @xmath8 ) ,",

    "moreover , already the data size of the current sensitive , high resolution , ` full sky ' cmb experiments such as wmap have been compelled to use sub - optimal pseudo-@xmath0 related methods  @xcite . on the other hand , optimal ml estimators can readily incorporate and account for various systematic effects , such as noise correlations , non - uniform sky coverage and beam asymmetries . the systematic correction to the pseudo-@xmath0 power spectrum estimate arising from non - uniform sky coverage has been studied and implemented for cmb temperature  @xcite and polarization  @xcite .",
    "the systematic correction for non circular beam has been studied by us  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the results to include non - uniform sky coverage .",
    "it has been usual in cmb data analysis to assume the experimental beam response to be circularly symmetric around the pointing direction . however , any real beam response function has deviations from circular symmetry .",
    "even the main lobes of the beam response of experiments are generically non - circular ( non - axisymmetric ) since detectors have to be placed off - axis on the focal plane .",
    "( side lobes and stray light contamination add to the breakdown of this assumption ) . for highly sensitive experiments ,",
    "the systematic errors arising from the beam non - circularity become progressively more important . dropping the circular beam assumption leads to major complications at every stage of analysis pipeline . the extent to which the non - circularity affects the step of going from the time - stream data to sky map is very sensitive to the scan - strategy .",
    "the beam now has an orientation with respect to the scan path that can potentially vary along the path .",
    "this implies that the beam function is inherently time dependent and difficult to deconvolve .    even after a sky map is made , the non - circularity of the effective beam affects the estimation of the angular power spectrum , @xmath0 , by coupling the power at different multipoles , typically , on scales beyond the inverse angular beam - width .",

    "for radically non - axisymmetric beams , modeling the beam in terms of superposition of displaced circular gaussian beams has been proposed  @xcite .",

    "non - circular beam effects can be modeled into the covariance functions in approaches related to maximum likelihood estimation  @xcite and can also be included in the harmonic ring  @xcite and ring - torus estimators  @xcite .",

    "while considerable attention has been devoted to the effects of incomplete / non - uniform sky coverage , no comprehensive or systematic approach is available for non - circular beam .",
    "the high sensitivity , ` full ' ( large ) sky observation from space ( long duration balloon ) missions have alleviated the effect of incomplete sky coverage and other systematic effects such as the one we consider here have gained more significance .",
    "non - uniform coverage , in particular , the galactic masks affect only cmb power estimation at the low multipoles .",
    "the analysis accompanying the recent second data from wmap uses the hybrid strategy  @xcite where the power spectrum at low multipoles is estimated using optimal maximum likelihood methods and pseudo-@xmath0 are used for large multipoles  @xcite .",
    "the non - circular beam is an effect that dominates at large @xmath10 comparable to the inverse beam width  @xcite . for high resolution experiments , the optimal maximum likelihood methods which can account for non - circular beam functions are computationally prohibitive .",
    "in implementing the pseudo-@xmath0 estimation , we have included both the non - circular beam effect and the effect of non - uniform sky coverage .",
    "our work provides a convenient approach for estimating the magnitude of these effects in terms of the leading order deviations from a circular beam and azimuthally symmetric mask .",
    "the perturbation approach is very efficient . for most cmb experiments the leading few orders capture most of the effect of beam non - circularity  @xcite .",
    "our results highlight the advantage of azimuthally smoothed masks ( mild deviations from azimuthal symmetry ) in reducing computational costs .",
    "the numerical implementation of our method can readily accommodate the case when pixels are revisited by the beam with different orientations .",
    "evaluating the realistic bias and error - covariance for a specific cmb experiment with non - circular beams would require numerical evaluation of the general expressions for @xmath35 using real scan strategy and account for inhomogeneous noise and sky coverage , the latter part of which has been addressed in this present work .",
    "it is worthwhile to note in passing that that the angular power @xmath0 contains all the information of gaussian cmb anisotropy only under the assumption of statistical isotropy .",
    "gaussian cmb anisotropy map measured with a non - circular beam corresponds to an underlying correlation function that violates statistical isotropy . in this case",
    ", the extra information present may be measurable using , for example , the bipolar power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "even when the beam is circular the scanning pattern itself is expected to cause a breakdown of statistical isotropy of the measured cmb anisotropy  @xcite . for a non - circular beam , this effect could be much more pronounced and , perhaps , presents an interesting avenue of future study .",
    "in addition to temperature fluctuations , the cmb photons coming from different directions have a random , linear polarization .",
    "the polarization of cmb can be decomposed into @xmath56 part with even parity and @xmath57 part with odd parity . besides the angular spectrum @xmath58",
    ", the cmb polarization provides three additional spectra , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 which are invariant under parity transformations .",
    "the level of polarization of the cmb being about a tenth of the temperature fluctuation , it is only very recently that the angular power spectrum of cmb polarization field has been detected .",
    "the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ) has measured the cmb polarization spectrum over limited band of angular scales in late 2002  @xcite .",
    "the dasi experiment recently published 3-year results of much refined measurements  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the boomerang collaboration reported new measurements of cmb anisotropy and polarization spectra  @xcite",
    ". the wmap mission has also measured cmb polarization spectra  @xcite .",
    "correcting for the systematic effects of a non - circular beam for the polarization spectra is expected to become important .",
    "extending this work to the case cmb polarization is another line of activity we plan to undertake in the near future .    in summary ,",
    "we have presented a perturbation framework to compute the effect of non - circular beam function on the estimation of power spectrum of cmb anisotropy taking into account the effect of a non - uniform sky coverage ( eg .",
    ", galactic mask ) .",
    "we not only present the most general expression including non - uniform sky coverage as well as a non - circular beam that can be numerically evaluated but also provide elegant analytic results in interesting limits . as cmb experiments strive to measure the angular power spectrum with increasing accuracy and resolution , the work provides a stepping stone to address a rather complicated systematic effect of non - circular beam functions .",
