    "study of the electromagnetic ( em ) decays of the hadronic states is of interest for understanding the structure of hadronic matter and for revealing the fundamental mechanisms for the interactions of photons and hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the em dalitz decays @xmath14 of light unflavored vector mesons ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) are specially interesting for probing the electromagnetic structure arising at the vertex of the transition @xmath18 to the pseudoscalar . in table",
    "[ lightdecays ] , we summarize the experimental results for the em dalitz decays of the light vector mesons",
    ". the ratios of the dalitz decays to the corresponding radiative decays of vector mesons are suppressed by two orders of magnitude , especially , for @xmath19 modes . assuming point - like particles",
    ", the decay rate of this process vs. @xmath4 can be exactly described by qed  @xcite in the standard model ( sm ) . however , the rate is strongly modified by the dynamic transition form factor @xmath20 ( @xmath7 ) , which can be estimated based on models of qcd  @xcite .",

    "these data are from pdg2010  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we discuss the constraints and discovery potential for the @xmath9 boson at beijing electron - positron collider ii ( bepcii )  @xcite . since the @xmath9 boson couples mainly to the sm electromagnetic current  @xcite .",
    "its production at bepcii is the same as that of photon , although with a much suppressed rate .",
    "therefore , the process @xmath25 will have a chance to look for u boson as well .",
    "the on - shell u boson will decay to a pair of leptons in @xmath26 , leading to a signal of @xmath27 .",
    "the sm background @xmath28 , although large for this process , is not a severe problem as the kinematics of the signal are quite distinct .",
    "the invariant mass of the lepton pair is just within a single bin due to the tiny width of the vector @xmath9 boson and can be distinguished from the sm background .",
    "it will be interesting to look for a low mass , up to gev scale , u boson in these modes .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dgamman ] ) , the number of background events in the window of @xmath29 ( resolution of the @xmath30 ) around @xmath31 is about @xmath32   \\delta q^2 \\times br(\\psi \\rightarrow p\\gamma),\\nonumber \\\\",

    "the size of the bin is the window size @xmath29 which is obtained from the resolution functions of the @xmath4 in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in ref  @xcite based on the besiii monte carlo simulations . by replacing the photon by @xmath9 boson in @xmath40 , the signal rate can be estimated to be @xmath41 , where @xmath42 was defined in eq .",

    "in summary , the em dalitz decays of @xmath55 are studied in this paper .",
    "we demonstrate the differential decay rate as both @xmath30-dependent rate and angular dependent rate explicitly . by assuming simple pole approximation",
    "the decay rates for @xmath56 are estimated for the first time .",
    "the estimated dalitz decay rates could reach @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "they will be accessible in the besiii experiment with data sample of 1 billion @xmath38 decay events . especially , the @xmath30-dependent differential decay rate can be measured by looking at the invariant mass of the lepton pairs .    in the besiii experiment",
    ", these measurements will be important for us to understand the interaction of vector charmonium states with photon , as well as to probe new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we have investigated the signatures of a hidden @xmath12 sector at the besiii experiment in @xmath62 decays , and find that the besiii should have an intrinsic sensitivity to the kinetic mixing parameter @xmath42 in the range of @xmath63 - @xmath64 , which depends on the mass values of the @xmath9 boson .",
