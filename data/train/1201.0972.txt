    "define @xmath470 and @xmath471 similarly with @xmath19 replaced by @xmath167 .",
    "we choose @xmath454 sufficiently large and then @xmath472 sufficiently small so that @xmath473 is a negligible vector that does not perturb the lorentzian metric much and so that @xmath474 are directions of lorentzian metrics for which ( i ) @xmath426 is a time - like vector ; and ( ii ) the light cone emerging from @xmath399 includes @xmath301 . here , @xmath416 is the uniform bound of @xmath19 in @xmath414 @xcite .",
    "note that this means that @xmath432 should be chosen on the order of @xmath475 once @xmath454 has been chosen so that @xmath476 is sufficiently small .",

    "using cauchy data on @xmath477 , we can then solve the linear equations on the slab @xmath478 and get the solution at the surface @xmath479 .",
    "for the solutions @xmath466 and @xmath467 , we obtain as a slight modification of @xcite the stability result : @xmath480 the above measurements @xmath481 are those for the functions @xmath482 and @xmath483 .",
    "such measurements can be constructed from the three measurements for @xmath468 , @xmath469 and @xmath484 .",

    ", we need that @xmath429 and @xmath430 be not too close to one - another ( this is guaranteed by @xmath428 ) so that the inversion of the @xmath494 system is well - conditioned . on each slab , we define the angles @xmath487 and @xmath495 in order again to have lorentzian metrics with directions close to @xmath429 and @xmath430 .",
    "we then obtain a similar estimate to and pursue by induction until we reach the slab @xmath496 .",
    "the stability results then apply to @xmath497 and @xmath498 , and we thus obtain a global estimate for @xmath19 as in earlier sections .",
    "so far , the illuminations @xmath34 prescribed on @xmath6 to solve the elliptic problem are of a very specific type . in order for @xmath497 and @xmath498 to be the solutions to the elliptic problems on @xmath6 , then @xmath402 needs to be the trace of @xmath499 on @xmath8 .",
    "it is for these illuminations that the three measurements @xmath500 for @xmath501 generate lorentzian metrics that satisfy the above sufficient properties .",

    "therefore , there is an open set of boundary conditions @xmath402 close to @xmath502 such that the conclusion holds , as well as the same expressions on the other slabs @xmath503 .",
    "this concludes the proof of the result .",
    "[ rem : cgo0 ] the `` three '' measurements @xmath504 for @xmath501 in actually correspond to `` two '' physical measurements .",
