    "one of the more remarkable results to emerge from the study of various statistical mechanical models coupled to two - dimensional quantum gravity is a solution of the ising model in field @xcite . in discrete form",
    "the coupling to gravity takes the form of the spin models living on an annealed ensemble of triangulations or quadrangulations , or their dual planar graphs . the partition function for the ising model on a single graph @xmath1 with @xmath2 vertices @xmath3",
    "is promoted to a partition function which incorporates a sum over some class of graphs @xmath4 by the coupling to gravity , @xmath5 the solution to the ising model in @xcite proceeded by first forming the grand canonical partition function @xmath6 and then noting that this could be expressed as the free energy @xmath7",
    "\\right )   \\label{matint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of a matrix model , where we have written the potential that generates @xmath0 graphs . in the above @xmath8 are @xmath9 hermitian matrices , @xmath10 and the @xmath11 limit is performed in order to pick out planar graphs .",
    "the graphs of interest are generated as the feynman diagrams of the `` action '' in equ .",
    "( [ matint ] ) , which is constructed so as to weight each edge with the correct boltzmann weights for nearest - neighbour interaction ising spins . since the edges carry matrix indices the graphs in question are `` fat '' or ribbon graphs .",
    "the integral of equ .",
    "( [ matint ] ) can be evaluated using the results of @xcite to give ( when @xmath12 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined by @xmath15 .",
    "\\label{geq}\\ ] ]",
    "the idea that the zeroes of the partition function could determine the phase structure of a spin model first appeared in lee and yang s work @xcite .",
    "they considered how the non - analyticity characteristic of a phase transition appeared from the partition function on finite lattices or graphs , which was a polynomial @xmath16 for a lattice with @xmath17 edges and @xmath2 vertices , again with @xmath18 .",
    "they ( and fisher @xcite ) showed that the behaviour of the zeroes of this polynomial in the complex @xmath19 or @xmath20 plane , in particular the limiting locus as @xmath21 , determined the phase structure .",
    "for temperature driven transitions , in zero external field for simplicity , the thermodynamic limit of the free energy on some class of lattices or graphs @xmath22 becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is some set of curves , or possibly regions , in the complex @xmath20 plane on which the zeroes have support and @xmath25 is the density of the zeroes there .",
    "the general question of how to extract the locus of zeroes analytically has been considered by various authors , notably shrock and collaborators @xcite for ising and potts models .",
    "it was first observed in @xcite that such loci could be thought of as stokes lines separating different regions of asymptotic behaviour of the partition function in the complex temperature or field planes .",
    "more recently , the case of models with first - order transitions has been investigated by biskup _",
    "_ @xcite who showed that the partition function of a statistical mechanical model defined in a periodic volume @xmath26 which depends on some complex parameter such as @xmath20 or @xmath19 can be written in terms of complex functions @xmath27 describing @xmath28 different phases , where the various @xmath27 are the metastable free energies per unit volume of the phases , @xmath29 characterises the free energy when phase @xmath30 is stable .",
    "the zeroes of the partition function are then determined from the solutions of the equations @xmath31 the equations ( [ master ] ) are thus in perfect agreement with the idea that the loci of zeroes should be stokes lines , since the zeroes of @xmath32 lie on the complex phase coexistence curves @xmath33 in the complex parameter plane .",
    "the specific biskup _",
    "_ results apply to models with first - order transitions , but we are interested here in an ising model with a third - order transition , so it might initially seem that these results were inapplicable .",
    "we are saved by the fact that when considered in the complex temperature plane the transition is continuous only at the physical point itself ( and possibly some other finite set of points ) .",
    "the determination of the locus of fisher zeroes for the ising model on random graphs in the thermodynamic limit using the ideas of the previous section turns out to be rather straightforward , as we now describe . since we wish to match @xmath34 between the various solution branches to obtain the loci of fisher zeroes and @xmath35 for the ising model on planar graphs , the equation which determines the loci of zeroes in the thermodynamic limit is @xmath36 where the low - temperature solution @xmath37 and the various high - temperature solutions @xmath38 are given by solving @xmath39 in equ .",
    "( [ geq ] ) for @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting curve is shown in the @xmath20 plane in fig .  1 where it can be seen that in addition to the physical phase transition at @xmath41 , an unphysical transition with the same kpz @xcite exponents appears at @xmath42 .",
    "the interior of the curve is the ferromagnetic @xmath43 region and the exterior the paramagnetic @xmath44 and unphysical `` @xmath45 '' phases , separated by cuts on the imaginary axis which we have not plotted .",
    "the points plotted in fig .",
    "1 are generated from a series expansion of @xmath46 in equ .",
    "( [ fullpart ] ) , which is arrived at by reverting the expression for @xmath47 and substituting the resulting @xmath48 into equ .",
    "( [ fullpart ] ) .",
    "earlier work reported in @xcite obtained similar results at lower orders .",
    "the form of the expression for @xmath46 means that the contributions from each of the terms in equ .",
    "( [ fullpart ] ) are proportional @xcite , so the full series for @xmath46 can be generated from @xmath49 .",
    "the loci of fisher zeroes are highly non - universal , and we also show the zeroes on `` thin '' , generic random @xmath50 graphs for comparison in fig .  2 . these models can be thought of as the @xmath51 limit of the matrix models , rather than the @xmath11 planar limit .",
    "similar methods to those discussed above also serve in this case where one has mean - field behaviour @xcite . for the ising model on thin graphs @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the saddle point action for either the low- or high - temperature phase .",
    "the equivalent of equ .",
    "( [ ecurve ] ) is then @xmath54 potts zeroes and chromatic zeroes are also accessible on the thin graphs .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that an analytic determination of fisher zeroes for the ising model on both fat and thin random graphs is possible , and that series expansions are easily obtainable .",
    "the general form of the solution also holds on ( planar ) random quadrangulations and @xmath50 graphs , and in non - zero field , so all of these can also be investigated .",
