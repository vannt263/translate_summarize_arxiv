    "the compact , flat - spectrum radio source pks  1830 - 211 ( @xcite ) is a well - studied gravitational lens located behind the galactic plane @xmath9 . at radio wavelengths , pks  1830 - 211 consists of two bright , flat - spectrum sources embedded in a ring like structure with a diameter of 1 .",
    "the radio emission is known to be variable , and a time delay of 26 days has been determined by monitoring the source at 8.6 ghz ( @xcite ) . at millimeter wavelengths ,",
    "molecular absorption lines are detected in both sources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and are attributed to a galaxy at @xmath10 .",
    "additionally , redshifted 21 cm absorption is found at @xmath11 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relative role of these two systems in lensing of the radio source is unclear ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical identification of pks  1830 - 211 has long been hampered by the presence of a nearby , bright m - star ( @xcite ) and by obscuration by both the galactic plane and the lens itself .",
    "pks  1830 - 211 was finally identified in deconvolved images taken at infrared wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "these images show the ne component of the source , the m - star and the sw component of the source , which is most likely blended with the lensing galaxy .",
    "the source is very red : the ne component has @xmath12 , so that at k ( 2.15 @xmath0 m ) it is much brighter than the nearby m - star , which dominates at optical wavelengths .    in this letter , we describe how we were able to determine the redshift of pks  1830 - 211 from infrared spectroscopy carried out with sofi , the new ir imager and spectrograph on the eso new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , chile ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data also allow us to derive the extinction along the line of sight to pks  1830 - 211 and an estimate of the mass of the lensing galaxy at z=0.886 .",
    "pks  1830 - 211 was observed with sofi ( sofi stands for son of isaac , the latter is the near - ir instrument on the first 8.2 m unit telescope of the very large telescope at paranal , chile ) during the night of 1998 june 13 .",
    "sofi is an ir instrument capable of imaging , polarimetry , and low resolution spectroscopy .",
    "the detector is a hawaii 1024@xmath131024 hgcdte array .",
    "spectra were taken with the red grism , which covers the wavelength range from 1.51 to 2.54 @xmath0 m , and with the 1  slit , which gives a resolution of 700 at 2.1 @xmath0 m .",
    "the slit was aligned to pass through both the ne and sw components of source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ) .    for accurate sky subtraction , the source",
    "was alternatively observed at two positions separated by 40 arcseconds along the slit . at each position , the exposure was 180 seconds .",
    "the conditions at the time of the observation were very cloudy , so only 24 minutes of useful data were obtained .",
    "the night sky , which consists of bright emission lines and a thermal continuum , is effectively removed by subtracting , from each other , frames taken at alternative positions along the slit .",
    "the resulting images are then flat - fielded , registered , and combined to give a two dimensional spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the source is then extracted and wavelength calibrated , which is done by fitting arc lines from a xenon lamp in the adaptor .",
    "the residuals of the fit are 0.5  .",
    "the extracted spectrum is then divided by that of a very hot star , in this case an o6 star , to remove the strong atmospheric absorption features that appear in infrared spectra . in a final step ,",
    "the spectrum is multiplied with a blackbody curve that is appropriate for an o6 star .",
    "we have used a blackbody with a temperature of 36,000  k. at this temperature and wavelength , the shape of the blackbody curve is not a sensitive function of the temperature .",
    "note that the o6 star may contain weak bracket and hei lines that are introduced in the reduction process .",
    "however , there is no evidence of them in the fully reduced spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] displays the reduced spectrum of pks  1830 - 211",
    ". regions of significant atmospheric absorption are marked by horizontal lines . since",
    "the atmosphere is almost totally opaque near 1.9 @xmath0 m and beyond 2.5@xmath0 m , the data in these regions have been deleted . due to the presence of clouds during the observations ,",
    "no absolute flux calibration could be carried out and the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is shown on a relative @xmath14 flux scale .",
    "we could not use the @xmath15-band flux derived by courbin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to put the spectrum on an absolute flux scale because the source is variable in the ir .",
    "the spectrum contains a contribution from the m - star ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) that lies 05 to the north of the ne component of the qso . at 1.25 @xmath0 m",
    "the m - star is twice as bright as the ne component . at 2.15",
    "@xmath0 m the ne component is 3 times brighter that the m - star ( see courbin et al .",
    "1998 ) and largely dominates the total flux that falls within the slit .",
    "a very strong @xmath16 emission line is seen at a redshift of @xmath17 .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in the redshift is due to internal instrumental flexure . also visible , but at lower signal to noise ratios , are h@xmath18 and possibly the 4959   and 5007   lines of [ oiii ] .",
    "all four lines are marked in fig .",
    "the rest equivalent width of the @xmath16 line is 170    and the velocity width is 2600 .",
    "both measures are somewhat lower than the average value for high redshift quasars ( @xcite ) , although the range for high redshift quasars are large .",
    "the @xmath16 line can not be fitted with a single gaussian .",
    "there are broad wings on either side of the line , particularly on the red side .",
    "the region around the @xmath19 and [ oiii ] lines is quite noisy .",
    "the lines may be blended with a feii multiplet , # 42 in oke & lauer ( 1979 ) .",
    "this multiplet is a common feature in quasar spectra at both low and high redshifts .",
    "however , the strength of this feature varies greatly from one quasar to the next ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a spectrum with better signal to noise is required before these features can be positively identified .",
    "the region near 18,000    is on the edge of the strong absorption feature that lies between the @xmath20 and @xmath15 ir windows .",
    "the redshift determined from @xmath21 line alone is @xmath22 , the same as that determined from @xmath23 .",
    "thus , despite the noisy nature of the region surrounding this line , it is unlikely that the line at 23,000   has been misidentified as @xmath16 .    the 5007   [ oiii ] line is slightly blueshifted ( @xmath24 ) with respect to the @xmath16 and @xmath21 lines .",
    "if the relative motion of the broad and narrow line regions is along the line of site , the difference in the redshift corresponds to a velocity shift of 250 km / s .",
    "this has been observed in other quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "other common quasar emission lines such as heii at 4686  , hei at 5876  , @xmath25 , [ oiii ] at 4363   and a feii complex around 4500   are not detected , although they are within the wavelength limits of our spectrum in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "however , given the strength of the @xmath21 line , this is not surprising .",
    "the continuum shows a steep increase towards longer wavelengths . between 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath0 m",
    "it can be approximated by a power law @xmath26 with a spectral index @xmath27 .",
    "this is considerably steeper than the median value of @xmath28 for quasar spectra ( @xcite ) , even considering orientation effects ( baker & hunstead , 1995 ) , and it implies a considerable amount of reddening .",
    "any reddening in the o star that was used to remove the atmospheric absorption features would bias the derived reddening in pks  1830 to smaller and not higher values .",
    "by comparing the radio and near - ir flux ratios between the lensed components of pks  1830 - 211 , courbin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated a differential extinction in the rest frame of the lens of @xmath29 between the sw and ne components .",
    "this value is estimated from @xmath15 band observations and assumes that the lensing galaxy does not contribute to the flux of the sw source ( @xcite ) . at the lens redshift ,",
    "the @xmath15 band is still in the near - ir , so we can safely assume that extinction does not depend dramatically on galaxy type , as it could at shorter wavelengths .",
    "thus , if we adopt a galactic extinction law with @xmath30 , we find that the sw component is absorbed by @xmath31 magnitudes relative the ne component .",
    "our near - ir spectrum is dominated by the light from the ne component ( the sw component is 3 magnitudes fainter ) , and offers the opportunity to estimate the line - of - sight absolute extinction . for this purpose",
    ", we do not use the slope of the continuum , which is partially contaminated by the nearby m - star , but instead measure the balmer decrement , given by the line flux ratio @xmath32/f[\\rm{h}_{\\beta}]$ ] , and compare it with previous measurements of other quasars .",
    "common measurements give @xmath32/f[\\rm{h}_{\\beta}]\\sim 4 - 5 $ ] and are interpreted in terms of moderate intrinsic reddening ( e.g. , @xcite ) or enhanced @xmath33 emission due to collisional excitation ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that the balmer decrement depends on the core - to - lobe flux ratio , @xmath34 .",
    "they find @xmath32/f[\\rm{h}_{\\beta}]$ ] in the range 5 - 6 for @xmath35 , and up to 10 for @xmath36 .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath37 line is uncontaminated by other lines , @xmath32/f[\\rm{h}_{\\beta}]=11\\pm2 $ ] .",
    "this implies that pks  1830 - 211 is significantly reddened . if we assume further that all the absorption occurs in the z=0.886 lens , that the balmer decrement of the unreddened quasar is five , and that a galactic absorption law is applicable , we find that the ne component has @xmath38 in the rest frame of the lens .",
    "thus , the extinction towards the ne component in the rest frame of the lens is @xmath39 magnitudes , which implies an extinction of @xmath40 magnitudes towards the sw component .",
    "we stress that these estimates are very uncertain",
    ". they can change if any of the following are true : ( i ) some fraction of the reddening is caused by our galaxy or by the hi absorber at @xmath41 , ( ii ) the @xmath37 line flux is overestimated , ( iii ) pks  1830 - 211 is reddened at the source , ( iv ) the sw component contributes significantly to the flux , ( v ) the sw component is blended with some other object , for example , the lensing galaxy ( courbin et al .",
    "( vi ) the galactic extinction law does not apply for the lens galaxy , and ( vii ) the balmer decrement of the unreddened quasar is not five .",
    "with the source and lens redshifts known , the mass interior to the radio ring can be estimated from a simple point mass model .",
    "table 1 gives this mass for two different cosmologies .",
    "such relatively low masses , in the range @xmath42 , combined with the fact that a very significant amount of dust is present in the deflector , suggests that the deflector is a late type spiral .",
    "more detailed models ( @xcite ) , which incorporate some constraints on the position of the lensing galaxy relative to the qso images and on the geometry of the source , give even lower values : @xmath43 .",
    "the models of kochanek & narayan ( 1992 ) , which use the radio structure of the lens to characterise the lensing potential , give one dimensional velocity dispersions that range between 150 and 210 km / s .",
    "pks  1830 - 211 is known to be variable at radio and millimeter wavelengths ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . with the present measurement of the redshift of the source ,",
    "this quasar becomes a good candidate for constraining @xmath44 .",
    "recently , a time delay of @xmath45 days between its two point - like components was reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is substantially smaller than the time delay of @xmath46 days reported by van ommen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . since the lower estimate of the time delay",
    "was obtained from radio observations with high angular resolution , almost allowing for the separation of the ne and sw components , we consider it to be more accurate .",
    "we use this low value with the models of @xcite to deduce @xmath6 .",
    "the derived estimates tend to be higher that those derived from other lensed quasars , even with a large @xmath47 . for @xmath3 , @xmath6=@xmath7 ; for @xmath5 it increases to @xmath6=@xmath8 .",
    "the rather large uncertainty in the time delay , approximately 20% , translates directly into an uncertainty in @xmath44 .",
    "this uncertainty may be lessened by monitoring pks  1830 - 211 in the near - ir .",
    "in particular , @xmath15-band observations , where the source is bright due to the presence of redshifted h@xmath48 emission ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , should allow accurate photometry of both the ne and sw components .",
    "our ir observations of the quasar obtained in march and june 1998 show that the ne and sw components have brightened by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "similar changes were also found at millimeter wavelengths during the same epochs ( t. wiklind 1998 , private communication ) .",
    "the strong h@xmath51 line can be used to search for differences between continuum and line variability and thus can be used to help us distinguish between intrinsic source variability and differential magnification of the continuum versus the broad - line region due to the passage of compact micro - lensing sources in the lensing galaxy .",
    "monitoring of pks  1830 - 211 carried out simultaneously in @xmath20 ( continuum ) and @xmath15 ( h@xmath48 ) would provide adequate material , not only for the measurement of @xmath6 , but also for the study of micro - lensing itself .",
    "newly available near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrograph images show that the lensing galaxy is located near to the center of the radio ring , so that the two qso images probe the lensing potential at similar distances from the lens center .",
    "we can therefore expect that detailed modelling of the system will strongly depend on the accuracy reached on the position of the lensing galaxy , as found in pg  1115 + 080 ( e.g. , keeton & kochanek , 1997 , courbin et al .",
    "1997 , impey et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the relative ease with which we obtained the redshift of this lensed radio source by ir spectroscopy lends considerable hope to the identification of the other classical radio lenses for which source redshifts are still outstanding .",
    "the authors would like to thank d. hutsemkers for useful conversations on reddening by the lensing galaxy .",
