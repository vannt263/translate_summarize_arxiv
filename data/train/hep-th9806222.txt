    "the principal chiral model @xmath2 is defined by the action : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite : @xmath5 in eq.(1 ) @xmath6 is a lie group valued field defined on a two - dimensional compact spacetime surface @xmath7 .",
    "the region of integration @xmath8 in eq.(2 ) is a three - dimensional simply - connected manifold whose boundary is @xmath9 .",
    "topological arguments show that the ambiguity in this definition amounts to the wzw functional ( 2 ) being determined up to a positive integer , which can be reabsorbed into the constant k in eq.(1 ) @xcite .",
    "if the lie group is simple this ensures the positivity of the action ( 1 ) .",
    "here we shall consider the group @xmath10 .",
    "the action ( 1 ) hence enjoys a @xmath11 global symmetry .    for @xmath12",
    "the theory corresponds to a @xmath13 nonlinear sigma model .",
    "its behaviour is massive .",
    "if @xmath14 the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis reveals that it interpolates between two fixed points @xcite . the ultraviolet ( uv ) fixed point is controlled essentially by the first term in eq.(1 ) .",
    "the rg flow of the coupling @xmath15 terminates at the infrared ( ir ) fixed point @xmath16 where the theory becomes massless at all distances . at this point",
    "the theory is characterized by a conformal field theory based on two @xmath17 kac - moody algebras ( at level @xmath18 ) . for a generic k",
    "the rg trajectory arrives at the ir fixed point along the direction defined by the irrelevant field @xmath19 of dimension @xmath20 @xcite . for @xmath1",
    ", this field does not exist in the conformal theory and the incoming direction is defined by the operator @xmath21 , composed from the components of the stress tensor of the ir conformal field theory .",
    "the point where the model crosses over from the region of one fixed point to the other introduces a mass scale that breaks the scale invariance .",
    "the @xmath2 was argued to be integrable in refs . @xcite-@xcite and its thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations proposed in @xcite .",
    "zamolodchikov s c - function was shown to take the values @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the fixed points .",
    "the latter is in agreement with the central charge of the @xmath17 conformal field theory @xcite , @xcite . al.b.zamolodchikov and a.b.zamolodchikov subsequently proposed the background scattering in terms of massless particles that leads to the correct tba equations for @xmath1 @xcite . following a prescription developed by smirnov and kirillov @xcite in the context of the @xmath0-invariant thirring model",
    ", they also showed that the form factors associated with the chiral currents obey the correct commutation relations .",
    "however the central term remains undetermined .",
    "notwithstanding this , it can be shown to take the correct value by tba analysis , @xcite .",
    "mejean and smirnov @xcite derived the form factors for the trace of the stress tensor .    in this work , we study the model in the presence of reflecting boundaries .",
    "this problem may appear awkward at the first sight due to the very definition of the action ( 1 ) .",
    "this is because the boundary of a boundary is evidently an empty set .",
    "however we shall circumvent this obstacle by ignoring the classical action ( 1 ) altogether and going directly to the quantum theory .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that we are not able to apply useful information from the classical theory , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the determination of the boundary conditions compatible with integrability and the corresponding reflection amplitudes will involve some amount of guesswork .",
    "we shall use as guideline some knowledge coming from the symmetries of the problem , the limiting ir conformal field theory and a related problem ( kondo ) .",
    "the difference between this and the kondo problem lies in the fact that in the former the scale invariance is broken in the bulk by a mass scale associated with a very unstable @xmath24-isovector resonance , whereas in the kondo problem the scale invariance is broken at the boundary .",
    "let us first assemble some known results about this model , @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the theory consists of stable massless particles : left - movers and right - movers .",
    "it is convenient to parametrise the on - mass - shell momenta of the particles in terms of the rapidity variables @xmath25 : @xmath26    with this parametrisation opposite momenta still correspond to opposite rapidities , @xcite . for left - left and right - right scattering",
    "all mandelstam variables vanish and since the scattering depends only on the dimensionless ratios of the momenta , the mass scale @xmath27 is arbitrary .",
    "the right - left scattering on the other hand distinguishes some preferable scale normalization @xmath27 .",
    "the mandelstam variable is now : @xmath28 for the scattering of a right - mover with rapidity @xmath29 and a left - mover with rapidity @xmath30 .",
    "the soft scattering corresponds not to @xmath31 but rather to @xmath32 .",
    "the mass scale @xmath27 can thus be chosen so that the crossover occurs at @xmath31 .    besides being massless these particles form doublets @xmath33 under the global @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "however there is an additional structure : each particle is also a kink , @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 wzw model has @xmath34 degenerate vacua .",
    "the allowed kinks interpolate between adjacent vacua .",
    "so , for instance , each left - moving particle doublet can be labeled by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an index referring to the vacua @xmath37 . in the simplest case @xmath38 , which is the one we are interested in , the only nontrivial structure is that of a @xmath33 doublet .",
    "we then represent the @xmath39 doublet of right - moving particles by the symbol @xmath40 ( @xmath41 is the right isotopic index ) and the @xmath42 doublet of left - movers by @xmath43 ( @xmath44 is the left isotopic index ) with energy spectra given by eq.(3 ) .",
    "the charge conjugation operator @xmath45 is defined with respect to the @xmath0 symmetry by : @xmath46 we shall denote the antiparticles of @xmath40 and @xmath47 by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "let us now consider the general @xmath50 scattering of a particle @xmath51 with its antiparticle @xmath52 .",
    "the s - matrix element is given by @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the forward and backward amplitudes are : @xmath55 however , for massless particles backward scattering is unacceptable and we therefore set @xmath56 .",
    "the particle - particle s - matrix element is given by : @xmath57 with @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the transition and reflection amplitudes , respectively .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the 2-particle amplitude in the isovector and isoscalar channels : @xmath61 using the requirements of factorizability , unitarity and crossing symmetry , the following minimal solution was suggested in ref.@xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 of course we get exactly the same expression for the l - l scattering .",
    "the non - trivial right - left scattering is defined by the commutation relations : @xmath64 as we discussed before , this scattering breaks the scale invariance thus spoiling the @xmath65 current algebra symmetry .",
    "however action ( 1 ) is invariant under the global @xmath66 isotopic symmetry at all distances .",
    "the only form of @xmath67 preserving this symmetry is : @xmath68 the factorization constraint is trivially met for this choice . for massless particles there is a combined unitarity - crossing restriction , @xcite : @xmath69 the simplest non - trivial solution proposed in ref.@xcite is , which coincides with that of the tba equations for the magnons , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . ] : @xmath70 it is worth noting that both amplitudes ( 12 ) and ( 16 ) have no poles on the physical sheet .",
    "also , we see from the soft scattering @xmath71 in eq.(16 ) that the fields behave as fermions . and since @xmath72",
    ", we conclude that we have a selection rule preventing any two particles of the same type to be in exactly the same quantum state .",
    "let us assume that our system is now restricted to the truncated line @xmath73 with a boundary located at @xmath74 .",
    "we can interpret the boundary as an impenetrable particle sitting at the origin .",
    "furthermore we consider that the boundary conditions satisfy the following prerequisites :    \\(1 ) the integrability is preserved ,    \\(2 ) the boundary does not introduce any additional mass scale ,    \\(3 ) at the ir fixed point conformal invariance is conserved .",
    "the last statement can be made more precise . if @xmath75 is the boundary state in the hilbert space of the conformal field theory , then @xcite , @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the generators of the current algebra .",
    "if the virasoro modes , @xmath78 , are constructed according to sugawara s prescription , then : @xmath79 cardy @xcite @xcite argued that these boundary states are in one - to - one correspondence with the set of conformal blocks .",
    "this has the immediate consequence that , since the conformal towers are labeled by the isospin @xmath80 @xcite of the corresponding primary operator , so must the boundary states .",
    "the modular properties of the kac - moody characters @xmath81 are encoded in the matrix @xmath82 , @xmath83 where : @xmath84 the partition function on an annulus of width @xmath85 with boundary conditions @xmath86 on each side and the points along the periodic direction identified modulo @xmath87 is given by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 are the structure constants of the fusion rules , which can be obtained from the verlinde formula @xcite : @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "all these results hold because the conformal field theory @xmath65 is diagonal in the sense that the partition function of the theory on the torus takes the diagonal form being a simply - connected group ( cf.@xcite ) ] : @xmath93 as @xmath87 tends to infinity the dominant contribution to the partition function ( 18 ) is that of the state with lowest energy given by : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath96 in the representations @xmath97 for which @xmath98 . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , we have two integrable representations , corresponding to isospins @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "they have been identified with the identity operator and the fundamental field @xmath6 in the wzw action , respectively @xcite .",
    "the modular matrix @xmath101 is given by , @xcite : @xmath102 from ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) we get : @xmath103 so we look for two distinct boundary conditions that lead to the two above in the ir limit . the @xmath65 conformal field theory with a boundary",
    "can also be seen as the ir limit of another integrable model where this time the rg flow is controlled by the boundary interaction .",
    "this situation is connected to the kondo problem .",
    "the hamiltonian of the multi - channel kondo problem is that of a k - tuple of free massless fermions @xmath104 ( @xmath105 )",
    "antiferromagnetically coupled to a fixed impurity of spin s in 3 dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the interaction term is of the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the pauli matrices .",
    "a variety of arguments show that this problem can be described by a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theory on the half line with the impurity sitting at the boundary",
    ". moreover the rg flow interpolates between an unstable uv fixed point where the impurity is decoupled ( @xmath108 ) and a strongly coupled ir one where the spin of the impurity is ` _ screened _ ' @xmath109 .",
    "as before the crossover introduces a scale @xmath110 called the kondo temperature . in the bulk",
    "the spectrum of particles is the same as for the @xmath2 .",
    "however due to the bulk scale invariance , the r - l scattering must be trivial . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the l - l and r - r scattering are given by ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) .",
    "actually in this description we are only considering the @xmath17 spin symmetry in @xmath111 and discarding the additional charge @xmath112 and `` flavour '' @xmath113 symmetries .",
    "this is because the impurity only couples to the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the particles are again @xmath0 doublets with a kink structure .",
    "several cases have to be distinguished , @xcite , @xcite . in the underscreened case ( @xmath114 )",
    "one electron from each species binds to the impurity effectively reducing its spin to @xmath115 .",
    "the impurity particle is thus a member of a @xmath116-dimensional @xmath0 multiplet .",
    "in the exactly screened case ( @xmath117 ) the electrons completely screen the impurity and it behaves like a @xmath0 singlet . finally , in the overscreened case ( @xmath118 ) the boundary particle develops a kink structure .    for @xmath1 ,",
    "the overscreened case is not allowed , as this would imply @xmath119 , which means that there is no coupling to the impurity .",
    "the exactly screened case corresponds to @xmath120 and hence the impurity behaves effectively as a @xmath0 singlet . in this case",
    "the reflection amplitude was found to be , @xcite : @xmath121 the underscreened case arises when @xmath122 . if @xmath123 , then @xmath124 and the impurity is a @xmath0 doublet .",
    "there is also the possibility @xmath125 , which we shall not consider here . in the underscreened case",
    "@xmath123 the boundary has an isotopic spin index associated with it .",
    "the reflection matrix is given by eq.(9 ) .",
    "let us emphasize that our problem is not the kondo problem .",
    "nevertheless , when we derive the boundary consistency equations , in the limit when the bulk theory becomes scale invariant , the scattering amplitudes of the kondo problem should solve these equations",
    ". this will be an important consistency check .",
    "this program is depicted in fig.[fig : rg ] .    with these considerations in mind",
    "let us first admit that the boundary impurity has effectively no spin .",
    "this would correspond to the exactly screened case in the kondo problem .",
    "we shall call this `` _ fixed _ '' boundary condition .",
    "the reflection matrix @xmath126 is defined by @xcite : @xmath127 @xmath128 is formally an operator which , when acting on the vacuum , creates a boundary state @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath129 the fact that the boundary impurity is an @xmath0 singlet implies the following diagonal form : @xmath130 the diagonal matrix ( 26 ) automatically satisfies the boundary yang - baxter equation irrespective of @xmath131 . let us now consider the boundary crossing unitarity condition : @xmath132 where @xmath133 . from eqs.(14 ) and ( 26 ) we get : @xmath134 next we consider the boundary unitarity condition : @xmath135 using ( 26 ) , we get : @xmath136 note that we have been using the quantity @xmath137 which would correspond to a left - moving particle being reflected into a right - moving one .",
    "this does not seem to make much sense given that our system is defined on the half line @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "however , as we will see , it will prove useful to ignore this and see it only as a formal tool to derive consistency equations for the boundary reflection factors .    substituting eq .",
    "( 28 ) into ( 30 ) , we get : @xmath139 notice that we can not take @xmath140 as can readily be verified if we substitute @xmath141 in eqs.(28 ) and ( 30 ) . as we discussed",
    "before if we take the bulk r - l scattering to be trivial @xmath142 , then the exactly screened amplitude ( 24 ) of the kondo problem is a solution of eq.(31 ) .",
    "let us now consider ( 31 ) with nontrivial r - l scattering .",
    "this has the minimal solution : @xmath143 with @xmath144^*$ ] .",
    "this amplitude has no poles on the physical sheet .",
    "the only pole lies in the second sheet @xmath145 at @xmath146 and is associated with the mass scale of the bulk theory .",
    "let us now consider the second situation when the boundary has an effective spin @xmath124 .",
    "this will be denoted as `` _ free _ '' boundary condition .",
    "we then have : @xmath147 where @xmath148 creates a boundary state with isotopic spin @xmath149 : @xmath150 the boundary yang - baxter equation has to be slightly modified to incorporate this additional structure , @xcite : @xmath151 substituting ( 14 ) , we get : @xmath152 we see that the bulk r - l scattering decouples as before",
    ". we will see that it only plays a role in the boundary crossing - unitarity condition .",
    "this , of course , is a consequence of the r - l scattering being diagonal . substituting ( 9 ) ,",
    "this yields : @xmath153    \\sigma_t ( \\beta_1 - \\beta_2 ) = \\\\ \\\\ = \\left [ r_{bc}^{\\bar a c ' } ( \\beta_1 ) r_{a c'}^{\\bar b d } ( \\beta_2 ) -    r_{a c'}^{\\bar b d } ( \\beta_1 ) r_{bc}^{\\bar a c ' } ( \\beta_2 ) \\right ]    \\sigma_r ( \\beta_1 - \\beta_2 ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] since the total isospin has to be conserved , we assume the following @xmath0 symmetric combination : @xmath154 we then get , using ( 11 ) : @xmath155 which implies : @xmath156 the boundary unitarity condition , @xmath157 reads : @xmath158 finally , we consider the boundary crossing - unitarity condition .",
    "we assume the following generalization : @xmath159 where we used the fact that the r - l scattering is diagonal .",
    "following berg et al .",
    "@xcite ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) , we define the following crossing symmetric matrix : @xmath160 as before the matrix @xmath161 vanishes , because it is associated with the exchange of momenta , which is not possible since the boundary particle has to stay at rest after the interaction . in terms of @xmath162 and @xmath163 , ( 42 ) reads : @xmath164 the unitarity conditions , @xmath165 yield the following equations for @xmath162 and @xmath163 : @xmath166 notice that if we choose , @xmath167 then eq.(38 ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "the boundary yang - baxter equation for antiparticles yields : @xmath168 which is perfectly compatible with eq.(39 ) for the choice ( 47 ) . solving this whole system",
    "is tantamount to finding @xmath169 such that : @xmath170 suppose that the r - l scattering becomes trivial @xmath171 . in that case",
    "it is perfectly acceptable to take @xmath172 : @xmath173 this system is solved by @xmath174 , in agreement with fendley .",
    "the system ( 49 ) with @xmath131 given by eq.(16 ) is not consistent for @xmath175 .",
    "again this is checked immediately for @xmath176 .",
    "it has the minimal solution , @xmath177 where @xmath137 is given by eq.(32 ) and @xmath178^*$ ] .",
    "let us restate our results .",
    "the @xmath179 wzw theory was defined in an axiomatic fashion by introducing the current algebra and constructing the conformal symmetry according to sugawara s procedure .",

    "there are two rg trajectories that terminate at this theory in the ir limit .",
    "one of them - the kondo theory - suggests the interpretation of the two boundary conditions as the exactly screened and underscreened situations , respectively . the factorized scattering is well known for this theory .",
    "the second trajectory represents the principal chiral model with scale invariant boundary conditions .",
    "the symmetries of the model , the ir limiting wzw theory and comparison with the kondo model allowed us to construct the corresponding reflection amplitudes , ( 32 ) , ( 50 ) .",
    "the set of equations thus obtained are also valid if we introduce an additional boundary perturbation .",
    "however it is not clear whether the integrability is still preserved .",
    "we will present some checks for these results elsewhere , @xcite .",
