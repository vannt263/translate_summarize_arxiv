    "core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) are triggered by massive stars at the end of their lives .",
    "thanks to the high luminosity , sne can be detected in distant galaxies . by measuring the cosmic occurrence rate of core - collapse sne , one can study the overall formation rate of the massive star population through cosmic time .",
    "with upcoming or planned large - scale optical and near - infrared ( nir ) surveys , sne could be detected to @xmath7 or higher .",
    "it is thus important to derive a realistic estimate for the detectability in order to make an efficient survey strategy for such observational programmes .",
    "@xcite study the detectability of core - collapse sne with the _ large synoptic survey telescope _",
    "( lsst , @xcite ) .",
    "they show that the wide survey with lsst ( with the 5 @xmath8 @xmath9-band limiting magnitude of 25 mag ) can detect type ii sne , core - collapse sne with hydrogen features , up to @xmath10 .",
    "magnification by gravitational lensing will boost the number of detectable sne @xcite .",
    "type ii sne at higher redshifts can be detected by an extremely deep nir survey @xcite with future satellites such as _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) .",
    "@xcite show that up to several thousands type ii sne can be detected at @xmath11 if the survey depth reaches the flux limit of 3 njy ( 30 mag in ab magnitude ) , which can be achievable with long ( @xmath12 seconds ) integration with jwst .",
    "it may be more promising to aim at detecting sne that are bright in the rest frame optical to ultra - violet ( uv ) wavelengths .",
    "type iin sne , a type of sne with narrow hydrogen emission lines , are ideal targets to detect at high - redshifts @xcite .",
    "type iin sne are thought to be powered by the interaction of the sn ejecta with the circumstellar medium @xcite , and are bright in the rest frame optical to uv .",
    "@xcite reported the discovery of type iin sne at @xmath13 and 2.0 in the archival data of the legacy survey with canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "there is another type of possibly luminous sne worth mentioning here .",
    "pair - instability sne ( pisne ) are thought to be triggered by very massive stars with mass in the range of 140 - 260 @xmath14 at zero metallicity @xcite , and are also expected to be very luminous @xcite .",
    "pisne might also occur even in the local universe , as suggested by the recent discovery of sn 2007bi @xcite .",
    "however , pisne are not very luminous at rest uv wavelengths @xcite , and thus they can be detected only at @xmath15 even with lsst @xcite .",
    "it is possible , in principle , to detect pisne at @xmath16 with an extremely deep nir survey with @xmath1728.7 mag ( @xcite , see also recent papers by @xcite ) , but the occurence rate of pisne ( or the formation rate of extremely massive stars ) at such high redshifts is highly uncertain .",
    "interestingly , recent theoretical studies and detailed simulations of the first generation of stars suggest that the characteristic mass of the first stars is not as large as the progenitor of a pisn @xcite .",
    "then observing core - collapse sne may be a more promising route to study the massive star population in the early universe .",
    "recently , superluminous sne were discovered such as sn 2006gy @xcite and sn 2005ap @xcite , whereas other superluminous sne include sne 2003ma @xcite , 2006 oz @xcite , 2008es @xcite , 2008fz @xcite , 2008ma @xcite , 2010gx ( ptf10cwr , * ? ? ?",

    "ptf09atu , ptf09cnd , ptf09cwl , @xcite , ps1 - 10ky , ps1 - 10awh @xcite , and css100217 @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for other earlier candidates .",
    "these sne have an absolute magnitude of about @xmath18 mag in optical .",
    "some of them are classified as type iin ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or type iil , which is a subclass of type ii sne with the linear light curve decline @xcite , and others are hydrogen poor ( type ibc , e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nature of these superluminous sne is poorly known .",
    "some of them are powered by the circumstellar interaction , or by the shock breakout from the dense circumstellar medium @xcite , as suggested by the presence of narrow emission lines in superluminous type iin sne ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "it is also argued that superluminous sne could be powered by a large amount of @xmath19ni which is synthesized as a result of energetic core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "other scenarios include the interaction between shells ejected by the pulsational pair - instability @xcite , and sne powered by a magnetar @xcite .",
    "although the origin of the high luminosity is not yet fully understood , the progenitors of the superluminous sne are thought to be very massive .",
    "the long time - scale of the light curve is suggestive of a long diffusion times of optical photons and hence of a large mass of ejecta ( for a given kinetic energy ) .",
    "at least one progenitor of type iin sn is directly identified to be as luminous as luminous blue variables with the zero - age main sequence mass of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "superluminous sne may provide an important information on the star formation in the high - redshift universe .",
    "because superluminous sne are likely to be triggered by the very massive end of the stellar population , the relative occurence rate of such sne with respect to the overall star formation rate can be a sensitive probe of the slope of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that the shape of the imf may be different in the early universe , or could even be of top - heavy one ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . detecting superluminous sne at high redshifts will give a direct evidence for such non - standard imf .",
    "in this paper , we study the detectability of superluminous sne at high redshifts with the upcoming wide - field surveys .",
    "@xcite noted that superluminous sne are bright enough that they can be detectable even at @xmath0 with 8m - class telescopes , such as subaru and lsst .",
    "we derive a realistic estimate for the detectability for a few particular set of surveys . for the optical survey",
    ", we focus on the proposed survey with the subaru / hyper suprime - cam ( hsc , @xcite ) .",
    "the method of mock observations is described in section [ sec : setup ] .",
    "we show that with a realistic survey strategy we can detect superluminous sne to @xmath21 ( section [ sec : opt ] ) .",
    "more emphasis is made on the detectability by upcoming nir survey utilizing future satellites , such as euclid , the wide - field infrared survey telescope ( wfirst ) , and wide - field imaging surveyor for high - redshift ( wish ) ( section [ sec : nir ] ) .",
    "we study how the expected number of detection at @xmath6 is affected by the slope of the imf at the massive end .",
    "details of the sample selection are described in section [ sec : selection ] .",
    "finally , we give our concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusions ] ."
