    "the study of heavy quarkonium production is one of the best ways to understand hadronization in qcd .",
    "currently , the most widely used theory for heavy quarkonium production is the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) approach @xcite proposed in 1994 . by introducing a systematic velocity expansion , this theory can naturally solve the infrared divergence problem encountered in the color singlet model ( csm ) @xcite . in this sense",
    ", nrqcd factorization can be thought of as a generalized version of csm .",
    "furthermore , it also successfully explained the @xmath2 surplus found at tevatron @xcite by including color octet contributions .",
    "nevertheless , recent studies have shown that nrqcd factorization encouters serious difficulties @xcite .",
    "first , naive power counting implies that @xmath3 and @xmath4 productions at hadron colliders are dominated by the @xmath5 color octet channel which results in transverse polarization at high transverse momentum , @xmath6 . however , experimental measurements found these states to be almost unpolarized .",
    "current explanations of @xmath1 polarization include @xmath7 color octet dominance @xcite and cancelation of transverse polarization between the @xmath5 and @xmath8 color octet channels @xcite .",
    "whether these explanations can be generalized to other quarkonium states is still in question .",
    "second , the nonperturbative color octet long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) extracted from hadron colliders @xcite are inconsistent with the upper bound set by @xmath9 collisions @xcite .",
    "thus the ldmes are not universal . finally , there is still no convincing proof of nrqcd factorization to all orders in @xmath10 .",
    "the state - of - art proof is only to next - to - next - to - leading order for special cases @xcite .    considering the above difficulties",
    ", one should definitely study nrqcd factorization in more detail , but , at the same time , one may need to turn to other theories of quarkonium production . a theory which is known to satisfy",
    "all - order factorization is the color evaporation model ( cem ) @xcite . in this model , to produce a charmonium states @xmath11 , one first produces a charm quark - antiquark pair @xmath12 with invariant mass smaller than the @xmath13-meson threshold .",
    "the pair then hadronizes to the @xmath11 by randomly emitting soft particles .",
    "the production cross section is expressed as @xmath14 where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the mass of charm quark ( @xmath13 meson ) and @xmath17 is the invariant mass of the @xmath18 pair . in this model , it is assumed that the @xmath11 momentum , @xmath19 , is approximately the same as the momentum of the @xmath12 pair .",
    "the predictive power of the cem is based on the assumption that the hadronization factor @xmath20 is universal and thus independent of the kinematics and spin of the @xmath11 , as well as the production process .",
    "although cem is intuitive , simple , and successful to explain @xmath1 production data , it has very fatal flaw .",
    "a straightforward conclusion from the cem is that the ratio of differential cross sections of two charmonia states is independent of the kinematics and independent of the colliding species .",
    "however , it has long known that experimental results of ratio of production cross section of @xmath0 over that of @xmath1 depend on their transverse momentum ( recent experimental data see refs .",
    "this disagreement is regarded as the main evidence that cem is a wrong .",
    "considered the advantages of cem mentioned above , we may need to study whether a modification of cem can provide a correct theory for quarkonium production . in this paper , by taking into account physical effects overlooked in the original cem , we propose an improved color - evaporation model ( icem ) .",
    "on the one hand , the nice features of cem are retained in the icem , including having only one parameter for each quarkonium state and satisfying all - order factorization . on the other hand ,",
    "the icem can correctly describe charmonium production cross section ratios .",
    "our picture of heavy quarkonium ( say charmonium ) production is as follows . to produce a charmonium state @xmath11 ,",
    "it is necessary to produce a @xmath12 pair in the hard collision , because the mass of the @xmath12 pair is much larger than the qcd nonperturbative scale @xmath21 .",
    "before the @xmath12 pair hadronizes to charmonium , it will exchange many soft gluons between various color sources , as well as emit soft gluons .",
    "an illustration of this picture is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] . in this figure",
    ", the blob marked by ` @xmath22 ' denotes the hard collision kernel , the blob marked by ` @xmath23 ' denotes soft interactions , and the thick double lines denotes the @xmath12 pair with momentum @xmath19 . to separate the hard part from the other parts , we introduce a scale @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and define the hard part as all particles that are off shell by more than @xmath26 .",
    "we emphasize that we distinguish soft gluons exchanged between the @xmath12 pair and other color sources ( with momentum denoted by @xmath27 ) from soft gluons emitted by the @xmath12 pair ( with momentum denoted by @xmath28 ) . indeed",
    ", these two kinds of soft gluons are significantly different",
    ". the total energy of exchanged gluons can be either positive or negative .",
    "however , the emitted gluons will eventually evolve to experimentally observable particles .",
    "thus their total momentum must be time - like and their total energy must be positive .    in our model , we construct a relationship between @xmath19 and @xmath29 , the average momentum of @xmath11 that has hadronized from a @xmath12 pair with fixed momentum @xmath19 .",
    "the relationship is easy to obtain in the rest frame of @xmath19 , with @xmath30 . for each event",
    ", we have @xmath31 in the spirit of the traditional cem , we assume the distributions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are rotation invariant in this frame , which implies @xmath32 and @xmath33 . because exchanged gluons can flow in either direction , we may expect @xmath34 . thus @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 where we use the fact that @xmath38 must be larger than @xmath39 .",
    "equation   sets a lower limit on @xmath17 that is significantly different from the lower limit @xmath40 of the traditional cem .",
    "as both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are order of @xmath24 , power counting of @xmath41 gives @xmath42 .",
    "combining with the on - shell condition @xmath43 , we arrive at @xmath44 .",
    "thus we have @xmath45 which again differs from the relation used in the traditional cem where @xmath41 is identified with @xmath19 .",
    "note that the proportionality between the momenta of the mother and daughter particles in eq .",
    "was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to relate the momentum of the @xmath46 and the @xmath1 produced by its decay .",
    "it has since been used in many calculations of quarkonium production in the nrqcd framework . in this paper , we prove the relation rigorously with clear assumptions . by combining eqs .   and , we arrive at the improved color evaporation model ( icem ) : @xmath47 with correction at @xmath48 .",
    "if one is only interested in the transverse momentum distribution , we have @xmath49    before performing any numerical calculations , we can already expect some advantages of the icem .",
    "first , because there is an explicit charmonium mass dependence in eq .  , the ratio of differential cross sections of two charmonia is no longer @xmath6-independent in the icem .",
    "thus it is possible to explain data such as @xmath50 .",
    "second , by making a distinction between the momentum of the @xmath12 pair and that of charmonium , the predicted @xmath6 spectra will be softer and thus may explain the high @xmath6 data better .",
    "we emphasize that the icem eq .",
    "[ eq : model ] does not mean that @xmath51 pair with invariant mass smaller than @xmath39 has no possibility to hadronize to @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , this kind of @xmath51 pair can absorb energy by interacting with other color source , and thus can have larger invariant mass and hadronize to @xmath11 . at the same time , even if the invariant mass of @xmath51 pair is larger than @xmath39 , it may loss energy by interacting with other color source , and eventually can not hadronize to @xmath11 because of invariant mass being too small . by assuming @xmath52 , we effectively approximate that the two effects cancel each other . as a result , the eq .  [ eq : model ]",
    "should be only interpreted at the integration level .",
    "an exception for the above argument is for the ground state particle production , say @xmath53 for charmonium .",
    "based on the quark - hadron duality , @xmath51 pair with invariant mass smaller than @xmath13 meson threshold must hadronize to charmonium , therefore it is not possible for a @xmath51 pair with @xmath54 to emit too much energy so that its invariant mass becomes smaller than @xmath55 .",
    "this means that the approximation @xmath52 is not reasonable here and thus icem is not good for @xmath53 production .",
    "however , for @xmath53 production , as the condition eq .",
    "is not needed , the original cem should be good .",
    "to confront our model with experimental data , we updated the cem parameters determined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work , in an attempt to reduce the uncertainty on the total charm cross section , the charm mass was fixed at @xmath56  gev while the factorization and renormalization scales were fit to a subset of the measured total charm cross section data .",
    "the values found were @xmath57 and @xmath58 employing the ct10 proton parton densities @xcite .",
    "the central open charm parameter set @xmath59 was used to calculate the energy dependence of the forward @xmath1 cross section , @xmath60 , in the cem using the exclusive @xmath61 production code described in ref .",
    "@xcite . because the nlo @xmath61 code is an exclusive calculation , the mass cut is on the invariant average over kinematic variables of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , in this calculation @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined relative to the transverse mass of the charm quark , @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "the normalization @xmath20 is the scale factor that adjusted the fraction of the total charm cross section in the mass range @xmath68 to the forward cross section data .    to determine the uncertainty on the @xmath1 calculation",
    ", the charm mass was varied between the upper and lower limits , 1.36 and 1.18 gev respectively , for the central values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the scales were varied around their central values while the charm mass was held fixed at its central value of 1.27 gev : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the upper ( lower ) limit of the factorization and renormalization scales determined from the charm fits . using the same value of @xmath20 in all cases ,",
    "the uncertainty band on the @xmath1 cross section was calculated by finding the upper and lower limits of the mass and scale variations and adding them in quadrature , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to calculate the charmonium @xmath6 dependence ,",
    "a gaussian transverse momentum broadening is added to the final state .",
    "the value of the average @xmath73 kick applied was taken to be @xmath74  gev@xmath75 @xcite , giving 1.19  gev@xmath75 at rhic and 1.49  gev@xmath75 at 7 tev .    since the icem calculation discussed here reduces the cross section relative to the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , the value of @xmath20 had to be increased by 40% to retain agreement with the data . the @xmath2 cross section and its uncertainty",
    "was calculated with the same parameters but with a value of @xmath76 scaled to the @xmath2 data .    to obtain the uncertainty on the @xmath77 ratio",
    ", the mass and scale uncertainties were assumed to be correlated .",
    "the resulting uncertainty band is dominated by the scale uncertainty , the mass uncertainty is small .",
    "our results for @xmath1 production cross section as a function of @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jpsi ] , where we compare with data at hadron colliders for center of mass energies of 0.2 tev and 7 tev . the 0.2 tev",
    "rhic data are measured by the phenix collaboration @xcite at central rapidities , @xmath78 , and the 7 tev lhc data are measured by the lhcb collaboration @xcite at forward rapidity , @xmath79 . the largest discrepancy between the model and the data is in the rhic data at intermediate @xmath6 , @xmath80 gev .",
    "however , since the experimental uncertainty is rather large in this region , our results are in general agreement with the data .",
    "we now turn to the @xmath0 production cross section as a function of @xmath6 in fig .  [",
    "fig : psi2s ] .",
    "we again compare with the midrapidity phenix data @xcite at 0.2 tev and the forward lhcb data @xcite at 7 tev .",
    "since the @xmath0 rates are generally lower , the measured uncertainty is larger . given this ,",
    "the agreement of the calculation with the data is also good .",
    "the ratio of the production cross sections of @xmath0 to that of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath6 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "the 0.2 tev rhic data and 7 tev lhc data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "although the original cem predicts a constant for this ratio , in contradiction with the data , our icem calculations are in good agreement with all data .",
    "by distinguishing between exchanged and emitted soft gluons and considering some physical constraints , we propose an improved color evaporation model for charmonium production .",
    "comparison with data shows that the icem can nicely reproduce the @xmath6 dependence of the ratio of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 production cross sections .",
    "thus , this improved model overcomes one of the main obstacles of the original cem .",
    "the success of the icem calculation confirms our picture of charmonium production .",
    "we note that the question of polarization in the icem as well as the original cem has not yet been addressed .",
    "as seen in the nrqcd approach , the polarization is an important test of models .",
    "the prediction of the final - state charmonium polarization depends on whether soft gluons change spin and angular momentum of the @xmath51 pair .",
