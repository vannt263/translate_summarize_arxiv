    "[ intro ] the role of hardonic soft interactions is hard to overestimate , since they are responsible for multi - particle production in high - energy hadronic collisions .",
    "low - momentum transfer characterizes these processes and the strong interaction constant is not a small parameter for them . as a consequence pqcd",
    "can not be used for their study .",
    "the models of quark - gluon strings ( qgsm ) @xcite and dual - parton model ( dpm ) @xcite , are based on nonperturbative notions , combining @xmath1 expansion in qcd with regge theory and using parton structure of hadrons . in both approaches the matrix element of hadron - hadron scattering amplitude consists from planar diagrams ( related to flavor exchange ) , which are associated with secondary - reggeon exchange diagrams in reggeon field theory ( rft ) and cylinder - type diagrams ( related to color exchange ) , which are associated with pomeron exchange in rft .",
    "@xmath1 expansion is a dynamical expansion and the speed of convergence depends on the kinematical region of studying process . at very high energies many terms of the expansion ( multi - pomeron exchanges ) should be taken into account .    in ref .",

    "it was applied for discription of soft single - diffractive dissociation process in hadronic interactions .",
    "it was shown that it is possible to describe data on diffractive @xmath2 and @xmath0 differential cross - sections in a wide energy range ( from @xmath3 = 65 gev / c to @xmath4 = 1800 gev ) accessible by different accelerators of cern and fermilab . in this article",
    "we incorporate qgsm into the model and give description of data on spectra of secondary particles produced in single diffraction dissociation .",

    "@xcite to describe soft single - diffractive process in the model where any number pomeron exchanges is taken into account together with each reggeon ( pomeron or secondary - reggeon , which was considered as @xmath5-trajectory ) of the triple - reggeon diagrams .",
    "the screening corrections between initial and final hadrons were also taken into account in the eikonal approximation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr3r ] .",
    "this approach allowed to describe inclusive spectra in single diffractive @xmath2 and @xmath0 interactions from fnal , isr to tevatron energies .    for multi - reggeon interaction vertices",

    "spectra of particles produced in single - diffractive dissociation we calculate within the framework of qgsm . in the next section",

    "in qgsm the production of a particle is defined through production of showers and each shower corresponds to the cut - pomeron pole contribution in the elastic scattering amplitude .",

    "being interested in the spectra of particles produced in single diffractive process we calculate @xmath36 for single - diffraction dissociation in the same way as for inelastic process in @xmath37 interaction with @xmath38 or @xmath39 . for eikonal approximation , which we use the expression for @xmath36",

    "spectra of secondary particles in single - diffractive dissociation process integrated over @xmath40 are given by the following expression : @xmath41 in order to calculate the distribution of hadrons produced during the fragmentation of the strings one should take into account that the hadron can be produced in each of the 2@xmath30-chains and the ( di-)quarks , which stretch the strings , carry only a fraction of energy of the incoming protons . in these terms , the inclusive spectra can be written as convolution of the probabilities to find a string with certain rapidity length and the fragmentation function , which defines the distribution of hadrons in the string breaking process .    for meson - nucleon collisions",

    "for instance , for fragmenting to a pion the parameterizations are ( see @xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath65 we do not list fragmentation functions for kaons and ( anti-)protons , they are taken from ref . @xcite .",
