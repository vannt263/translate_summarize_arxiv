    "this paper deals with the relation between the property of specific sites in a crystal and the property of the crystal itself .",
    "we shall discuss in particular the case of x - ray absorption spectroscopy , but many of our results are general .    the aim of this paper is to introduce x - ray physicists , experimentalists and theoreticians , to the use of spherical tensors to analyze theoretical and experimental spectra .",
    "therefore , our presentation is as pedagogical as we can manage .",
    "the manipulation of spherical tensors can be quite complicated , we have tried to reduce it to the simplest possible rules .",
    "an atom in a crystal occupies generally a crystallographic site that is not unique .",
    "the present paper was inspired by the concrete case of a chromium atom sustituted for aluminum in spinel @xcite .",
    "the chromium atom can occupy sixteen equivalent trigonal sites in the cubic cell .",
    "the ( normalized ) x - ray absorption spectrum of chromium is the average of the spectra of the chromium atoms occupying the sixteen sites .",
    "the angular - dependent spectrum of a chromium atom in a specific site is determined by its environment , but some features of this spectrum are lost by the average over the equivalent sites . if we want to investigate the deformation of the environment due to the substitution of chromium for aluminium , we need to know the spectrum of chromium at a given site .",
    "but some features of this spectrum are washed out by the fact that we can only measure an average spectrum .",
    "the present paper describes precisely the relation between the spectrum of a given site and the spectrum of the crystal .    if we want now to calculate the spectrum of chromium , we need to put a chrominum atom at a specific aluminum site , relax the environment , carry out a self - consistent calculation with and without core hole , and calculate the spectrum of this site .",
    "then , we need to repeat the procedure for all equivalent sites and take the average spectrum .",
    "a considerable amount of time can be saved if we calculate the spectrum of one site and deduce the spectrum of the other sites by symmetry considerations .",
    "the present paper gives all the tools required to do so .",
    "let us first defend the case of spherical tensors , that will be precisely defined in the next section .",
    "most physical properties are tensors and they are usually taken to be cartesian tensors . in this paper , we want to stress the advantage of using spherical tensors .",
    "they are a refinement with respect to cartesian tensor .",
    "for example , a second - rank cartesian tensor is the sum a zeroth - rank , a first - rank and a second - rank spherical tensors .",
    "this refinement enables us to discard irrelevant contributions .",
    "for example , the quadrupole transitions in x - ray absorption spectroscopy are represented by a fourth - rank cartesian tensor with 81 components , whereas it is represented by a zeroth - rank , a second - rank and a fourth - rank spherical tensor with 15 components altogether .",
    "moreover , the spherical average used to represent powder sample is obtained by taking only one spherical tensor component ( the zeroth - rank tensor ) whereas it is the sum of twelve cartesian components .",
    "thus , using spherical tensors can save computing time .",
    "the drawback of the spherical tensor analysis is that some subtelties enter its practical use ( the same is true for cartesian tensors ) .",
    "a purpose of this paper is to give a detailed presentation of these problems and of their solutions .    in practice",
    ", one faces the frustrating task of sorting out the various conventions used by the authors and to determine whether the rotation is active or passive , if the row index of the wigner matrix increases from left to right as in a normal matrix or decrease as in reference @xcite , p.  47 , which definition of the wigner matrix is used ( seven inequivalent definitions are found in the literature @xcite ) , how the tensor transforms under complex conjugation , etc .",
    "misprints are also numerous in the literature and we made thorough efforts to give correct formulas .",
    "the paper starts with a presentation of the cartesian and spherical tensors and a detailed description of the notation .",
    "then , the concept of tensor coupling is introduced and simple formulas are given to change the coupling order .",
    "these methods are applied to the calculation of electric dipole and quadrupole transitions .",
    "this completes the generalities on spherical tensors .",
    "then , we consider the case of crystals . we show how the symmetries of a crystal site constrains the spherical tensor components in the reference frame of the site and in the reference frame of the crystal .",
    "we also give the precise formula relating these reference frames . as an illustration",
    ", we treat the example of the al site in spinel and garnet . finally , we determine the spherical tensor describing the full crystal from those of the sites .",
    "an appendix gathers the formulas that were used to calculate rotation matrices , wigner matrices and solid harmonics .",
    "a cartesian tensor is the generalization of a scalar , a vector or a matrix .",
    "a vector @xmath0 is transformed by a rotation @xmath1 into a vector @xmath2 , so that @xmath3 .",
    "a vector is also called a first - rank tensor . a matrix @xmath4 defined by @xmath5 transforms under rotation into @xmath6 any matrix @xmath7 that transforms under rotation as in equation ( [ rang2 ] )",
    "is called a second - rank cartesian tensor . more generally , an @xmath8th - rank cartesian tensor is a generalized matrix @xmath9 that transforms under rotation as in equation ( [ rang2 ] ) , but with the product of @xmath8 matrices @xmath1 instead of just two .",
    "cartesian tensors are ubiquitous in physics .",
    "as we shall see , the electric dipole transitions are described by a second - rank tensor , the quadrupole ones by a fourth - rank tensor .",
    "cartesian tensors have very simple transformation rules under rotation , but they suffer from a severe drawback : they are not irreducible . to see what that means , consider a second - rank tensor @xmath7 .",
    "its trace is @xmath10 .",
    "it transforms under rotation into @xmath11 where we used the fact that @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the transpose of @xmath1 .",
    "we recover the fact that the trace of a matrix is invariant : it transforms into itself by rotation .",
    "a second - order cartesian tensor gives another interesting object , the vector @xmath14 , which is defined by @xmath15 , where the sum is over @xmath16 and @xmath17 from 1 to 3 .",
    "the levi - civita symbol @xmath18 is 1 if @xmath19 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath20 , it is -1 if @xmath19 is another permutation of @xmath20 and it is 0 if two indices are identical . then , using the identity @xmath21 , we see that @xmath14 transforms under rotation as a vector : @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , from a second - rank cartesian tensor , we can build a linear combination of its elements ( the trace ) that is invariant under rotation , and three linear combinations of its elements that transform into each other as the components of a vector .",
    "more generally , a tensor is said to be _",
    "reducible _ when there are linear combinations of its elements that transform into each other under rotation",
    ". when a tensor is not reducible , it is called irreducible .",
    "thus , a vector is irreducible but a second - rank cartesian tensor is reducible .",
    "the irreducible tensors are called _ spherical tensors _ and will be the main topic of this paper .",
    "the first spherical tensors were the spherical harmonics @xmath23 . for each @xmath24 , there are @xmath25 spherical harmonics @xmath23 that transform into each other by rotation .",
    "more precisely , for each rotation @xmath1 , there is a unitary matrix @xmath26 , called a _ wigner matrix _",
    "( to be precisely defined in the next section ) , such that the rotation of @xmath23 by @xmath1 is @xmath27 spherical tensors are defined in analogy with spherical harmonics . an @xmath24th rank spherical tensor , denoted by @xmath28 , is a set of @xmath25 components , written @xmath29 where @xmath30 , that transform under rotation as @xmath31 this definition is not very concrete , but we shall see how spherical tensors are built in practice .",
    "it is an unfortunate but historical fact that the position of @xmath24 and @xmath32 is different in the spherical harmonics @xmath33 and the spherical tensors @xmath29 .",
    "when many spherical tensors are involved in a formula , we use also the notation @xmath34 , @xmath35 , etc . for notational convenience ,",
    "we shall often write @xmath36 for equation ( [ rtl ] ) , as for the product of a matrix and a vector . moreover , the product of two wigner matrices will be written @xmath37 .",
    "spherical tensors can satisfy other symmetries .",
    "for example , most of them are built from hermitian operators and satisfy time - reversal symmetry : ( see equation  ( 4 ) p.  61 of @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath38 in this paper , the only tensors that do not satisfy time - reversal symmetry are those built from the polarization vector @xmath39 that can possibly be complex . in that case",
    "we have @xmath40 .",
    "this happens for instance when @xmath28 is a solid harmonics ( see section [ solharmsect ] ) .",
    "inversion is another common symmetry . in pure electric dipole and quadrupole transitions inversion",
    "does not play any role because all tensors are even ( i.e. invariant under inversion ) .",
    "however , the interference between dipole and quadrupole transitions is always an odd spherical tensor @xcite .",
    "the many conventions and misprints found in the literature forces us to describe in detail our notation and conventions .",
    "we consider _ active _ rotation , that is rotation that move the points and not the reference frame .",
    "for example the rotation through an angle @xmath41 about the @xmath42-axis is represented by @xmath43 after an active rotation @xmath1 , the coordinates @xmath44 of the vector @xmath45 are transformed into the coordinates @xmath46 of @xmath2 . in a _ passive _ rotation , the reference frame is rotated : the basis vectors @xmath47 are transformed into the basis vectors @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the coordinates of a point @xmath45 are transformed by the inverse matrix : @xmath49 .    to describe the transformation of the properties of a crystal under rotation",
    ", we consider the case of its charge density @xmath50 .",
    "after a rotation changing @xmath45 into @xmath2 , the charge density @xmath51 is transformed into a `` rotated '' charge density @xmath52 of the rotated crystal . to determine @xmath52 , we require that the value of the charge density is not modified by the rotation .",
    "more precisely , we want that @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the rotated function @xmath52 is defined by @xmath54 . for later convenience ,",
    "we denote the rotated function @xmath52 by @xmath55 .",
    "the use of the same symbol @xmath1 to denote the rotation of both the vectors and the functions should not bring too much confusion .",
    "the presence of the inverse rotation @xmath56 in the definition of @xmath55 ensures that @xmath57 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite p.  59 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath58 the wigner rotation matrix corresponding to the rotation @xmath1 .",
    "for example , @xmath59 .",
    "the wigner rotation matrices define a unitary representation of the rotation group , so that @xmath60 and @xmath61      the spherical harmonics are defined by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite p.  68 ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the rotation defined by the euler angles @xmath64 .",
    "for notational convenience , we denote by @xmath65 the vector @xmath66 and we write @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 and @xmath63 .",
    "this notation is justified by the fact that @xmath67 can be defined for any vector @xmath45 , not necessarily normalized .",
    "the resulting functions are called _ solid harmonics _ and are described in section [ solharmsect ] .",
    "solid harmonics are required , for example , in the presence of elliptically polarized x - rays because @xmath65 has then complex coordinates .",
    "a three - dimensional cartesian vector @xmath0 can be turned into a set of three solid harmonics @xmath70    this definition of spherical harmonics implies @xmath71 this is proved by noticing that the argument @xmath72 of the spherical harmonics corresponds to the argument @xmath73 of the wigner matrix in equation ( [ defspharm ] ) . by equation ( [ unitaire ] )",
    ", we have @xmath74 .",
    "the result follows from @xmath75 and the group representation property , equation ( [ grouprep ] ) .",
    "the same property is true for solid harmonics .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 the presence of the spherical harmonics on the left of the wigner rotation matrices ensures that @xmath77 . to show this , multiply equation ( [ ryellm ] ) on the left by @xmath78 : @xmath79 in the foregoing proof",
    ", we simplified the notation by omitting the component index @xmath32 ( as described at the end of section [ cartsphsect ] ) .",
    "physical properties can be represented by spherical tensors that can often be built by coupling lower rank tensors .",
    "we illustrate this construction by the example of electric dipole and quadrupole transitions .",
    "we shall use the remarkable toolbox for spherical tensor calculations elaborated by varshalovich , moskalev and khersonskii @xcite .",
    "many spherical tensors used in physics are obtained by coupling vectors .",
    "a three - dimensional cartesian vector @xmath80 can be turned into a first - rank spherical tensor @xmath81 by defining @xmath82 note that solid harmonics @xmath83 are also spherical tensors built from @xmath14 and that @xmath84 .",
    "however , the factor @xmath85 is cumbersome and the definition @xmath86 is often preferred .    two spherical tensors @xmath34 and @xmath35 of ranks @xmath87 and @xmath88 can be _ coupled _ into a spherical tensor of rank @xmath89 , denoted by @xmath90 , and defined by @xmath91 where @xmath92 are clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite .",
    "the clebsch - gordan coefficient is zero if @xmath93 .",
    "the triangle relation implies @xmath94 .",
    "the notation @xmath90 is inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the fact that they write the rank as an index instead of an exponent .",
    "for example , the coupling of two vectors ( i.e. first - rank spherical tensors ) gives a zeroth - rank , a first - rank and a second - rank spherical tensors .",
    "the zeroth - rank tensor obtained by coupling two vectors is proportional to the scalar product of these vectors : @xmath95 , because @xmath96 .",
    "more generally , we define the _ scalar product _ of two spherical tensors @xmath34 and @xmath97 of the same rank to be ( see @xcite , p.  64 and 65 ) @xmath98    it is often necessary to modify the coupling order of the tensors . for example , when calculating electric dipole transitions , we have to calculate @xmath99 , where @xmath45 is coupled to @xmath39 by the scalar product and then multiplied by its complex conjugate .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , it is more convenient from the physical point of view to couple the x - ray polarization vectors @xmath39 and @xmath100 . for that purpose",
    ", there is a powerful identity @xmath101 where @xmath102 runs from @xmath103 to @xmath104 by the triangle relation .",
    "this identity is proved in section [ couplingidsect ] .    in the next two sections ,",
    "we illustrate the recoupling methods with the calculation of electric dipole and quadrupole transitions .",
    "similar methods were used to investigate the interference of electric and quadrupole transitions and their interferences @xcite or to calculate x - ray scattering cross - sections @xcite .",
    "the electric dipole transitions amplitudes are given by the formula @xmath105 . if we denote @xmath106 by @xmath107 , equation ( [ scalaire ] ) gives us @xmath108 .",
    "for notational convenience , we remove the exponent 1 in the spherical tensors @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this should not bring confusion : if a vector takes part in a coupling , it is a first - rank tensor . using the recoupling identity ( [ recouple0 ] ) , we find the dipole transition intensity @xmath111 note that , for elliptic polarization , @xmath39 is complex , whereas the wavevector @xmath112 is always real .",
    "each term of a decomposition over spherical tensors has often a clear physical meaning . in equation ( [ dipole ] )",
    ", the variables concerning the incident x - ray ( i.e. @xmath39 and @xmath100 ) are gathered in @xmath113 , the variables concerning the crystal are in @xmath114 .",
    "thus , we can easily investigate the influence of a rotation @xmath1 of the crystal on the absorption cross - section @xmath115 where we used equation ( [ rtl ] ) and that @xmath114 is a @xmath87th - rank spherical tensor .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of a powder sample is given by the average over all orientations , i.e. over all rotations @xmath1 .",
    "this average is very simple with spherical tensors @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the term @xmath117 gives the spectrum of a powder , called the isotropic spectrum .",
    "@xmath118 where we used equation ( [ scalaire ] ) and @xmath119 .    to interpret the term @xmath120",
    ", we use the relation between vectors @xmath121 , @xmath14 and the corresponding first - rank tensors @xmath122 , @xmath81 ( we restore the tensor rank in @xmath122 , @xmath81 for clarity ) : according to equation  ( [ vecprod ] ) , @xmath123 is the first - rank tensor corresponding to the vector @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , @xmath125 the first cross product is related to the rate of circular polarization @xmath126 and to wavevector direction @xmath127 of the incident x - ray by @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the second cross product is zero for a non - magnetic sample because time - reversal symmetry implies @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the term @xmath120 describes magnetic circular dichroism .",
    "the term @xmath130 describes the linear dichroism of x - ray spectra .",
    "the number of non - zero components of @xmath131 depends on the symmetry of the crystal @xcite .",
    "we shall determine the number of non - zero components in the case of spinel and garnet .",
    "we consider the case of electric quadrupole transitions , which is more involved than dipole transitions .",
    "we start from the quadrupole transition operator @xmath132 and we rewrite it in terms of spherical tensors using equation ( [ prod0 ] ) : @xmath133 . in this expression @xmath39 is coupled with @xmath45 and @xmath112 with @xmath45 . as in the electric dipole , we want to gather all the terms concerning the crystal into a single tensor . for that purpose ,",
    "we use equation ( [ recouple0 ] ) with the sum over @xmath102 changed into a sum over @xmath87 @xmath134 the term @xmath117 is zero because , according to equation ( [ scalaire ] ) , @xmath135 since the polarization and wavevectors are perpendicular .",
    "the term @xmath120 is zero because equation ( [ vecprod ] ) gives us @xmath136 .",
    "thus , @xmath137 is reduced to the single term @xmath138 the tensor @xmath139 can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics ( equation  ( 23 ) , p.  67",
    "of @xcite ) @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the spherical coordinates of @xmath45 . for completeness , we give the components of @xmath144 : @xmath145    the electric quadrupole transition intensities are proportional to @xmath146 , where the transition amplitude is @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , @xmath148 , with @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 the apparent simplicity of this calculation is essentially due to the powerful tools given in reference @xcite .",
    "a straightforward approach is quite heavy @xcite .",
    "if the sample is nonmagnetic or the x - ray polarization is linear , the terms @xmath120 and @xmath154 are zero .    as in the electric dipole case , the term @xmath117 corresponds to the isotropic spectrum obtained by measuring a powder .",
    "equation ( [ prod4 ] ) gives us @xmath155 and the isotropic spectrum is @xmath156 the calculation of this average will be discussed in section [ sphavsect ] .    if @xmath157 ( i.e. the x - rays are linearly polarized ) or @xmath158 ( i.e. the sample is non magnetic ) , then the terms @xmath120 and @xmath154 are zero . more generally , for any tensor @xmath159 with integer rank @xmath87 , @xmath160 is zero for @xmath89 odd .",
    "this is due to the symmetry of the clebsch - gordan coefficients  @xcite @xmath161 : @xmath162 where we first exchanged the summation variables @xmath163 and @xmath164 , and used the symmetry of the clebsch - gordan coefficients , then the commutativity of @xmath165 and @xmath166 , and the fact that @xmath87 is an integer .",
    "if we consider only the case of linearly polarized x - rays or non - magnetic samples , only the terms @xmath117 , @xmath130 and @xmath167 are possibly non zero .",
    "the number of independent components depends on the crystal symmetry and is tabulated in @xcite .",
    "we describe how to calculate the spherical tensor of a crystallographic site , assuming that it is invariant under the symmetries of the site .",
    "we can work in a reference frame corresponding either to the site symmetries or to the crystal symmetries .",
    "if we take the aluminum sites of spinels as an example , the site symmetry is @xmath168 whereas the crystal is cubic . in the reference frame",
    "adapted to the site symmetry , the @xmath42 axis is along a diagonal of the cube . in the reference frame",
    "adapated to the crystal , the @xmath42 axis is along an edge of the cube .",
    "the symmetrized tensors has usually less nonzero components in the site axes , but they are easier to calculate in the crystal axes .",
    "we also give the way to go from one reference frame to the other .",
    "two examples are treated in detail : a spinel and a garnet .",
    "if @xmath169 is the symmetry group of the crystal , then a site has a symmetry group @xmath170 which is a subgroup of @xmath169 . to know the general form of a spherical tensor invariant under the site symmetries",
    ", we start from a general tensor @xmath28 and we calculate the symmetrized tensor @xmath171 compatible with the site symmetries by using the classical formula @xmath172 where @xmath78 runs over the symmetry operations of the subgroup @xmath170 and where @xmath173 is the number of elements of @xmath170 . from the physical point of view , this formula means that the tensor @xmath171 is obtained by averaging over all the symmetry operations that leave the site invariant . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", we project onto the subset of tensors that are invariant by any symmetry operation of @xmath170 . to check this ,",
    "take any operation @xmath1 in @xmath170 and evaluate the action of @xmath1 on the symmetrized tensor : @xmath174 because , @xmath170 being a group , the set of operations @xmath175 where @xmath78 runs over @xmath170 is the same as the set of operations of @xmath170 .      the rotations @xmath1 can be expressed either in the site axes or in the crystal axes .",
    "we shall see in the examples that the symmetric tensors are simpler in the site axes .",
    "moreover , some computer programs need to be used in the site axes . however , the matrices @xmath1 are easier to determine in the crystal axes , because they correspond to the symmetry operations of the crystal that leave the site invariant .",
    "both cases will be treated in the examples of the following sections .",
    "it is also necessary to describe precisely how to go from one reference frame to the other . if @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 are the orthonormal axes associated with the crystal and @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 those of the site , we denote by @xmath1 the rotation matrix such that @xmath182 .",
    "for example , if @xmath47 are the axes of the cube and @xmath183 are the trigonal axes along the @xmath184 direction , then @xmath1 is the rotation matrix corresponding to the euler angles @xmath185 .",
    "it is the inverse of the rotation matrix of equation ( [ butler43 ] ) .",
    "it can be checked that @xmath186 ( i.e. the three - fold axis is the @xmath42-axis of the site along the @xmath184 direction of the cube ) and @xmath187 ( i.e. the @xmath188 axis of the site is along the @xmath189 direction of the cube ) .",
    "if @xmath78 is a symmetry operation in the cubic axes of the cube leaving the site invariant , the basis change formula in a vector space implies that @xmath190 is a symmetry operation in the trigonal axes of the site . a spherical tensor @xmath28",
    "will be denoted by @xmath191 when it is expressed in the trigonal axes and by @xmath192 when it is expressed in the cubic axes .",
    "the argument 3 and 4 mean that the @xmath42 axis is along a three - fold axis for a trigonal basis and a four - fold axis for a cubic basis .",
    "the relation between @xmath191 and @xmath192 is given by the formula @xmath193    we give now two examples .",
    "we illustrate this method with the example of the aluminium site in spinel mgal@xmath194o@xmath195 , which is the most common mineral of the spinel structural family .",
    "the spinel structure is derived from a face - centred - cubic close - packing of oxygens with a space group symmetry @xmath196 .",
    "the conventional cubic cell contains 8 formula units , i.e. 32 oxygen atoms with 24 cations in tetrahedral and pseudo - octahedral interstices . with origin choice 2 @xcite ,",
    "the mg@xmath197 cations occupy 8 tetrahedral sites , which are located at the special 8a wyckoff positions ( 1/8,1/8,1/8 ) , with @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) point symmetry .",
    "the al@xmath200 cations occupy 16 pseudo - octahedral sites at the special 16d wyckoff positions ( 0,1/4,3/4 ) , with @xmath201 ( @xmath168 ) point symmetry .",
    "this symmetry corresponds to a small elongation of the octahedron along the trigonal axis , arising from a small departure of the position of the oxygens from the perfect fcc arrangement .",
    "the o@xmath202 ions are located at the wyckoff positions 32e ( u , u , u ) with point symmetry @xmath203 .",
    "the simplest results are obtained when the reference frame of the site is used .",
    "the point group of the site we consider is @xmath168 .",
    "the group @xmath168 has six pure rotations and the same six rotations multiplied by the inversion .",
    "we assume that the property that we investigate is not sensitive to the inversion operator , so that we only have to consider the six pure rotations .",
    "it is natural to take the @xmath42-axis along the three - fold axis and the @xmath188 axis along one of the @xmath204 axes .",
    "the results do not depend on which @xmath204 axis is chosen .",
    "however , they would be different if the @xmath188 axis were chosen , for example , between two @xmath204 axes .",
    "the six pure rotations are : the unit , the @xmath205 rotation about the @xmath42-axis through the angle @xmath206 , its square @xmath207 , the @xmath204 rotation about the @xmath188-axis through the angle @xmath208 and the other two rotations @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "these rotations have euler angles @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 , respectively .",
    "these rotations will be denoted by @xmath217 .    to calculate the symmetrized tensors for this site , we use equation ( [ siteaverage ] ) .",
    "the special cases given in section [ eulerwignersect ] enable us to show that @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "therefore , the sum @xmath221 is @xmath222 if @xmath32 is an integer multiple of 3 , and zero otherwise .",
    "we calculate the wigner matrices for the other three rotations and we obtain @xmath223 if @xmath32 and @xmath224 are integer multiples of 3 , and zero otherwise . equation ( [ siteaverage ] ) is then applied to a general fourth - rank tensor @xmath225 , where the argument @xmath226 denotes the trigonal axes and we obtain the non - zero components of the symmetrized tensor @xmath227 @xmath228 for the second - rank tensor , all symmetrized components are zero , except for @xmath229 .",
    "of course , we have also the relation @xmath230 , which is valid for any group .",
    "now we show that time - reversal symmetry implies that the symmetrized tensors are real .",

    "we could have used the quotient of the full space group by the group of translations of the fcc lattice ( which has only 48 operations ) , however our choice is simpler from the programming point of view : we take the symmetry operations given by the table @xcite , and we identify two points whose coordinates differ by an integer . ] .",
