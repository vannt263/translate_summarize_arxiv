    "observationally , the earliest stage of evolution for low - mass protostars is the so - called `` class 0 '' phase , which is characterized by a blackbody - like spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that peaks in the submillimeter ( @xcite , hereafter awb93 ) . barsony ( 1994 )",
    "defines the following as characteristics of class 0 objects : @xmath3 , an sed like a 30  k blackbody , undetected at @xmath4 m , and possession of a molecular outflow .",
    "these characteristics of class 0 objects imply that they are in a very active mass accretion phase , and possess more circumstellar mass than stellar mass .",
    "an even earlier phase of evolution prior to class 0 objects has also been proposed , the so - called `` pre - protostellar '' stage @xcite .",
    "observationally , objects in this stage of evolution have seds that are similar to class 0 objects , but they lack other kinematic signatures of star formation such as molecular outflows and centimeter continuum emission .",
    "the pre - protostellar cores are probably gravitationally bound , but lack a central hydrostatic stellar source , and are hence not yet `` protostars '' . indeed molecular line spectroscopy of a number of pre - protostellar cores ( e.g. @xcite ) show that they are undergoing infall , but more slowly than that seen towards class 0 protostars .    to study the detailed kinematical evolution of pre - protostellar objects to class 0 objects and beyond , it is important to study both type of objects with observational tools like millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy .",
    "pre - protostellar cores do not possess a strong outflow , and hence it is expected to be less complex to disentangle the various motions that accompany star formation such as infall , rotation , outflow and turbulence . since the details of the star formation process can vary from cloud to cloud , and",
    "may depend on environmental factors , it is crucial to choose pre - protostellar and protostellar candidates within the same region .",
    "the centrally condensed l1688 core of the nearby ( 160 pc ) @xmath0 ophiuchus ( hereafter @xmath0 oph ) molecular cloud consists of a rich array of young stellar objects at various stages of evolution @xcite .",
    "in particular , the cloud a region ( called @xmath0 oph a ) harbors a number of pre - protostellar and protostellar cores . in this region",
    ", there is vla1623 , which was designated as the prototype of the class 0 phase of evolution ( awb93 ) .",
    "vla1623  is known to possess a remarkably collimated and very young ( @xmath5 yrs ) molecular outflow ( @xcite , awb93 ) .",
    "the millimeter and submillimeter continuum maps of awb93 reveal that @xmath0 oph a breaks up into 4 cores , sm1 , vla1623 , sm1n , and sm2 .",
    "of these , vla1623  was the only source with an identified outflow .",
    "both sm1n and sm1 are probably real pre - protostellar cores ( awb93 ) .",
    "wide - field 1.3 mm continuum mapping by @xcite ( hereafter man98 ) reveals that oph a is the brightest of all oph cores , and in addition to vla1623  there are eight other starless cores in @xmath0 oph a. the objects a - mm6 , a - mm7 , and a - mm8 , together with sm1n , sm1 and sm2 , compose an arc within oph a , which seems to be delineating a photo - disassociation front of a pdr region illuminated by the nearby b star s1 ( see man98 ) .",
    "recent high angular resolution n@xmath6h@xmath1 observations @xcite of the quiescent dense gas in this region show emission peaks of this tracer at sm1 and sm1n , but not at vla1623 .",
    "n@xmath6h@xmath1 can deplete significantly at densities greater than @xmath7 @xmath8 @xcite , so the difference in n@xmath6h@xmath1 emission from sm1n to vla1623  might be another indicator that sm1n is less evolved than vla1623 .    in this paper , we present results of a study of the @xmath0 oph a region designed to make a comparison of pre - protostellar core(s ) with a more evolved class 0 protostellar object ( vla1623 ) .",
    "one of the main goals of this study was to understand better the earliest stages of star formation from the pre - protostellar phase to the class 0 phase .",

    "the red - shifted line profiles are consistent with expansion or outflow but the red - shifted opacity profiles are consistent with tracing infall . the main isotope",

    "outflows play an important role in the early phases of stellar evolution .",

    "centered on vla 1623 , we can see the outflow , especially the more collimated blue - shifted lobe of the outflow .",
    "the red - shifted line wing emission appears more diffuse throughout the region without a clear signature representing bipolarity of the outflow .",
    "a second blue - shifted component is seen east and north of vla 1623 .",
    "the submillimeter cso co j=3@xmath22  data have higher angular resolution and in this higher transition , excitation conditions are more favorable for picking up the strong line wing emission from outflows .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ hvco ] shows the integrated intensity maps from the co j=3@xmath22  line wing emission over a smaller region in @xmath0 oph a. indeed , in this transition the highly collimated outflow of vla 1623 is readily seen extending across the map from the northwest to the southeast .",
    "the superposition of the red and blue - shifted emission indicates the vla 1623 flow is located almost in the plane of the sky .",
    "also , the differing angles ( @xmath47 ) of the northwest red and blue outflow lobes is consistent with the co j=2@xmath21 observations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the north - west blue - shifted high velocity lobe attributed to vla 1623 may be a combination of an outflow from vla 1623 more in line with the vla 1623 red - shifted outflow lobe and a separate blue - shifted outflow originating from some source north and east of vla 1623 . north of the vla 1623 flow , we see two well - separated red - shifted and blue - shifted lobes .",
    "the midpoint of the line joining the peaks of red - shifted and blue - shifted emission of this flow north of vla 1623 falls very close to sm1n .",
    "we suggest that we have detected a new bipolar outflow centered on the source sm1n .",
    "a second outflow was reported to have been discovered north of the vla 1623 flow at approximately the position reported here , based on smaller angular extent millimeter interferometric measurements ( * ? ? ? * hereafter kshk ) , and jcmt co j=3@xmath22  observations ( * ? ? ? * hereafter kshuk ) . however , both of these studies covered a region only 1  centered on sm1n in right ascension .",
    "our maps cover 2.5  around sm1n in ra . as a result of the smaller scale of their observations , kshk and kshuk claim the detection of a new northern flow ( which they dubbed `` an outflow '' ) with a driving source that is a near - infrared star called gy30 ( which is @xmath48from sm1n ) .",
    "they also conclude that the an outflow has a blue - shifted lobe in the east , and a red - shifted lobe in the west , which is the same as the orientation of the vla 1623 flow .",
    "a comparison of figure 2 of kshuk with figure  [ hvco ] of this paper indicates that their blue - shifted lobe coincides with the northern blue - shifted lobe seen in our work .",
    "but kshuk do not observe the region where the eastern red - shifted lobe is seen . as a result",

    "it appears from our present work that a new bipolar outflow is present north of vla 1623 , with a driving source , which is most likely sm1n , and whose orientation of blue and red - shifted lobes in the sky is opposite to that of vla 1623 .",

    "the blue - shifted contours in vla1623  are even seen to extend north - east of the axis of rotation .",
    "the encroachment of the blue - shifted contours across the rotation axis displays the predicted `` blue - bulge '' infall signature .",
    "the region around sm1n shows a more complex morphology in the centroid velocity map .",
    "if the gradient in isovelocity contours towards sm1n is interpreted solely as that produced by rotation , one major feature is that the sense of rotation is counter to that of vla1623  with the blue - shifted gas north of the source and the red - shifted emission toward the south .",
    "another interesting feature is that unlike in vla1623 the isovelocity contours do not lie parallel to the outflow axis in sm1n . toward the eastern edge of the map , the contours curve to the expected orientation if the contours were to align with the rotation axis .",
    "however , in the central regions , the gradient appears to be in a north - north - west to south - south - east direction . such a direction for the gradient in hco@xmath1   emission might result if even its line - core in sm1n is tracing both outflow and infall , in which case the resultant velocity gradient would be oriented at an angle intermediate between the outflow direction and rotational gradient direction .",
    "although certainly less defined than the blue bulge found toward vla1623 , sm1n s blue bulge is evident from the blue shifted shifted isovelocity contours extending from the north - west through the source to the south - east .",
    "to constrain the infall parameters in both sources , we modeled our sources using a semi - analytic infall model based on the terebey , shu , and casen ( tsc ) collapse treatment @xcite . for a more complete explanation of the model used , see @xcite .",
    "the tsc model requires the use of three parameters : the sound speed @xmath66 , the rate of cloud rotation @xmath67 , and the infall time @xmath68 ( or infall radius @xmath69 ) .",
    "after the model protostar has been generated , values for the temperature , density , and velocity along the prescribed lines of sight ( loss ) are generated for any given viewing angle .",
    "the loss are defined by two geometric angles : @xmath70 , the angle out of the plane of the sky , and @xmath71 , the angle in the plane of the sky .",
    "after the program generates all loss , a separate radiative transfer code calculates molecular and continuum emission along all loss using the assumption of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "many model runs were made varying the infall and geometric parameters each time .",
    "the synthetic observations were then convolved to the resolution of the telescopes used in the observations .",
    "the best fit models were determined by eye by constraining the model spectra to the observed hco@xmath1  and h@xmath9co@xmath1spectra .",
    "the tsc model does not include outflows , while vla1623  and sm1n both have vigorous young outflow systems .",
    "however , as has been discussed in ",
    "[ impact ] , while the line - wing emission of hco@xmath1  seems to trace the outflows , the line - core emission itself seems to be less affected by the presence of outflows .",
    "indeed , for vla1623 , the centroid velocity map shown in figure  [ centroid ] shows predominantly the impact of rotation and infall , both of which are well - treated by the tsc formalism . in our infall modeling",
    ", we only use the line - core hco@xmath1  to constrain the infall parameters . even in this light ,",
    "the infall parameters derived here should be used with some caution , as the models are for single isolated protostars , and not for clusters of protostars , and hence not rigorously applicable to the observations .",
    "the comparison between the observed spectra and the simulated spectra of the best - fit model towards vla1623  is shown in figure  [ modelspectra ] .",
    "while the spectral shapes are reasonably well - fit ( at least in the central regions ) , the best fit tsc model does not do a good job of matching the observed centroid velocity map observed in hco@xmath1  j=4@xmath23  ( see figure  [ modelvs ] ) .",
    "given the caveats discussed above of applying the tsc model for this study , this latter result is not surprising .",
    "similar model plots were made for sm1n , but are not shown here .    since there is some evidence that even the line - core emission of hco@xmath1 in sm1n is being impacted by the observed outflow ( see   [ centroid_map ] and figure  [ centroid ] ) , it was expected that it would be harder to fit the sm1n observations to the tsc model . the velocity gradient in figure  [ centroid ] seems to imply a more or less east - west rotational axis if the gradient is purely interpreted as due to that of rotation . in view of the possible contamination from the outflow ,",
    "in our modeling , we forced the rotational axis for sm1n to be parallel to that of vla1623 . because of this , the model centroid velocity map for sm1n can not reproduce the direction of the gradients seen in the observed map of figure  [ centroid ] .",
    "however , the general appearance and width of the line profiles are well modeled even in the region towards sm1n .",
    "when the effects of outflows are separable from the observations of density - sensitive molecules such as hco@xmath1  and cs , the tsc model can be used reasonably effectively to derive infall parameters ( see the case of iras 16293 and smm4 in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the results of the tsc models clearly indicate the difficulty in modeling complex regions that consist of both infalling and outflowing motions .",
    "in fact , the inability to adequately account for the presence of outflows , severely handicaps the modelling of spectra and centroid velocity maps along the axes of the outflows . despite this shortcoming and the complexity of the region ,",
    "our models are robust enough to deduce key properties of the regions around vla1623  and sm1n .",
    "the tsc models confirm vla1623 s outflow is within the plane of the sky to @xmath72 as initially proposed by @xcite .",
    "second , our modelling of vla1623  could not reproduce the observations unless a temperature gradient was applied to the tsc code .",
    "the best fit temperature gradient decreases at an angle of 32  west of south .",
    "the nearby b3 star , s1 , provides the best physical explanation for this temperature gradient .",
    "our best model parameters are summarized in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "cccccccc[!h ]    vla 1623 & 0.01 & 0.33 & 3.0 x 10@xmath73 & 3 x 10@xmath74 & 0 & -60 & 0.5 + sm1n & 0.006 & 0.58 & 1.0 x 10@xmath73 & 7 x 10@xmath74 & 0 & -60 & 0.6 +      one of the more difficult challenges in star formation is the determination of age .",
    "this difficulty arises from the lack of a definitive definition for the age of a protostar and inability to accurately measure key time dependent observables such as mass infall rate and velocity dispersion .",
    "one of the first estimates for the age of vla1623  was derived by @xcite by examining the dynamical timescale for vla1623 s molecular outflow .",
    "their conclusion , a dynamical age of @xmath753000 yr , is similar to the age derived by awb93 ( @xmath766000 yr ) using the mass infall rate .    using our submillimeter co j=3@xmath22  data , the dynamical age of vla1623",
    "is found to be @xmath754000 yr , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "however , our modelling of vla1623  suggests an older age for the time since infall by approximately 10 times ( see table  [ parameters ] ) .",
    "given errors in the calculations of both the dynamical and modelled age estimates , the similarity of the infall and dynamical timescales leads to the conclusion that large outflows develop almost from the onset of collapse .",
    "we have observed two cores in the @xmath0 oph a molecular cloud to investigate the kinematic signatures of star formation .",
    "we obtained isotopic and main line co j=3@xmath22 , j=1@xmath20 , and hco@xmath1  j=4@xmath23 , j=1@xmath20data of a known class 0 source , vla1623 , and a core that was previously identified as a pre - protostellar core , sm1n . using more spatially extended and sensitive co maps than those of kshk and kshuk",
    ", we confirm the detection of the second molecular outflow north of vla1623 .",
    "this second outflow is most likely generated by the protostar sm1n , and not by the near - infrared star gy30 as suggested by kshk and kshuk .",
    "sm1n appears to be in a more progressed evolutionary stage of star formation than previously thought .",
    "millimeter observations toward the source positions show the expected blue asymmetry . however , the submillimeter transitions of hco@xmath1j=4@xmath23  display a line profile signature of expanding rather than infalling gas .",
    "most likely , in vla1623  and sm1n , the higher density , centrally condensed gas kinematics are greatly affected by the outflows emanating from both sources .",
    "examination of the opacity profiles , however , provides support that , despite outflowing material , the core is still undergoing gravitational collapse .",
    "we performed centroid analysis of vla1623  and sm1n to confirm the existence of the `` blue bulge '' signature found in other star forming regions .",
    "the `` blue bulge '' found around vla1623  is very well aligned with the axis of rotation and is strong , confirming that vla1623  is a true protostar .",
    "the centroid velocity map near sm1n also exhibits `` blue bulge '' signature but it is not as well aligned about a rotation axis as seen in vla1623 .",
