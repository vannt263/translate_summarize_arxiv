    "enabled by progress in chemical synthesis ( see @xcite for reviews ) , macromolecules with `` bottle - brush '' architecture where flexible side chains are densely grafted to a backbone , have found much recent interest ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such molecules may be useful for various applications ( such as sensors , actuators , building blocks in supramolecular structures @xcite ) , since these systems are stimuli - responsive polymers , exhibiting large conformational changes when external conditions vary .",
    "apart from these synthetic bottle - brush polymers , also biopolymers with a related architecture are abundant in nature , e.g. proteoglycans @xcite .",
    "these brush - like polymers contain a protein backbone with carbohydrate side chains , and are held responsible for a large variety of biological functions ( cell signaling , cell surface protection , joint lubrication , etc .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the interplay between entropic effects and various enthalpic forces in these `` soft '' objects makes the understanding of structure - property relationship of such bottle - brush polymers a challenging problem of statistical thermodynamics @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the interplay between chain conformations and local order in binary a , b bottle - brush polymers , from the point of view of both theoretical arguments and molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "previous work @xcite has focused on the possibility of microphase separation in the form of `` janus cylinders '' @xcite , i.e. , the cylinder splits in two halves ( in the most symmetric case , where the lengths @xmath2 of both types of side chains and their grafting densities @xmath3 are equal ) , such that the a - b - interface contains the cylinder axis ( taken to be along the @xmath4-axis henceforth ) .",
    "then it was pointed out @xcite that due to the quasi - one - dimensional character of this ordering , for finite cylinder radius r , no true long - range order of janus - cylinder - type should be expected : rather there exists a finite correlation length over which the orientation of the interface plane decorrelates .",
    "in addition , it was speculated @xcite that also the ratio @xmath5 between the interaction strength @xmath6 of unlike monomers and monomers of the same kind @xmath7 matters : if the formation of a - b interfaces is energetically much more unfavourable rather than the formation of polymer - solvent interfaces , a phase separation along the axial ( z ) direction of the cylinder could occur also in the form of a double cylinder ( the a - rich polymers form a separate cylinder from the b - rich ones , both cylinders touch each other along the z - axis ) @xcite . also intermediate cases ( `` janus dumbbell''-like cross sections of the bottle - brush )",
    "were suggested @xcite and some indication of such structures were observed @xcite . however , again only finite correlation lengths of such orderings along the z - axis can be expected .",
    "in addition , one needs to consider that for not very large grafting densities the bottle - brush polymer under poor solvent conditions does not form a structure that is homogeneous along the z - axis ( the direction of the backbone ; note that we restrict attention to rigid backbones only , for simplicity ) , but rather inhomogeneities in the form of a `` pearl - necklace''-structure form @xcite .",
    "the problem which we investigate in the following sections is whether it can be favorable to form a microphase - separated structure that is inhomogeneous along the z - axis .",
    "following the information from experiment that one side - chain can be grafted per backbone monomer @xcite , we assume an alternating grafting of the two types ( a and b ) of side chains @xcite .",
    "of course , this situation is essentially equivalent to the case where symmetrical block copolymers @xcite would be anchored with their a - b junction to the backbone .",
    "it is then also interesting to ask how such a situation compares to the case where such block copolymers fill a cylinder ( at the same density ) without constraint on the locations of the a - b junctions . of course",
    ", the latter problem has already been studied in other contexts @xcite . here",
    "we generalize the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite to take this constraint on the location of the a - b junctions into account to formulate a weak segregation theory @xcite of ordering in binary bottle - brushes ( sec .  2 ) . then we present data from molecular dynamics simulations , extending the study of ref .  @xcite by considering now the variation of properties with @xmath5 ( sec .",
    "we summarize the main findings of our work in the concluding section ( sec .  4 ) .",
    "the general idea of our theoretical approach is as follows .",
    "we consider the case when incompatibility of both sorts of blocks with the solvent is high enough to form a condensed state ( globule ) , which in the case of a rigid backbone would acquire the form of a cylinder uniformly filled by the monomers of the side chains .",
    "the height @xmath8 of the cylinder would be just the length of the rigid backbone and the radius @xmath9 would be related to the equilibrium monomer density @xmath10 inside the cylinder .",
    "such a condensed state could be considered as an equivalent of a bottlebrush compressed up to the monomer density @xmath10 via squeezing it into a tube of the radius @xmath9 . to consider the composition fluctuations in such a condensed ( squeezed ) bottlebrush we employ some new ideas , which were put forward in refs @xcite to generalize the seminal leibler theory @xcite",
    "( see also refs @xcite ) to confined polymer systems . to begin with ,",
    "we find , based on the theory of polymer globules by i. lifshitz et al .",
    "@xcite , the value of @xmath10 , which is to provide the minimum of the two - component bottlebrush free energy given the values of the chi - parameters @xmath11 ( a similar approach has been employed by borisov et al .",
    "@xcite for one - component bottlebrushes in a poor solvent ) . to determine the equilibrium value of a two - component bottlebrush forming a condensed state due to its overall incompatibility with the solvent we notice that , according to i. lifshitz et al @xcite , the free energy of any flexible polymer system is ( in a zeroth approximation ) just the sum of a structural ( entropic ) contribution , which allows for the effect of connectivity",
    "( `` linear memory '' in lifshitz terms ) and an energetic contribution , which allows for the van - der - waals attraction and the excluded volume repulsion effects : @xmath12    the precise form of the structural free energy @xmath13 as a functional of the spatially non - unform distributions @xmath14 of the local number densities of the repeat units of the @xmath15-th sort ( @xmath16 ) is determined by the actual microscopic structure of the bottlebrush .",
    "we analyze it somewhat later when studying the bottlebrush stability with respect to its longitudinal , angular or helical ordering .",
    "but now , when we focus on the basically uniform cylindrical globule , the structural term could be simply disregarded as compared to the energetic contribution to the free energy : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the volume of the cylindrical globule ( where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total number of both @xmath21 and @xmath22 side chains and the distance between the neighboring @xmath21 and @xmath22 chains ) , @xmath23 is the value of the local number density of the repeat units of the @xmath15-th sort , averaged over the whole volume @xmath24 of the bottlebrush , and the specific ( per unit volume ) free energy @xmath25 depends on the type of the interactions between the solvent molecules and repeat units ( monomers ) forming the bottlebrush . for simplicity , we assume in this paper that these interactions correspond to the conventional incompressible flory - huggins lattice model , in which case @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the excluded volume assumed , for simplicity , to be the same for both sorts of the repeat units and solvent molecules , @xmath28 is the local volume fraction of the particles of the @xmath15-th sort within the globular bottlebrush , @xmath29 is the total polymer volume fraction ( volume fraction of all monomers ) , @xmath30 is the volume fraction of the solvent molecules and @xmath11 are the conventional flory - huggins energetic parameters .    for the homogeneous bottle brush we are considering here , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the fraction of the monomers of the @xmath15-th sort , and , thus , the function @xmath33 can be rewritten in the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the effective @xmath36-parameter describing the overall bottlebrush - solvent incompatibility and the parameter @xmath37 does not affect the equilibrium value of @xmath38 .",
    "indeed , taking into account that the polymer volume fraction within the uniform bottlebrush is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total average number of all monomers @xmath21 and @xmath22 per the distance @xmath41 of the backbone , one can reduce the total free energy ( [ freev ] ) to the form @xmath42 . \\label{free0}%\\ ] ]    minimization of the free energy ( [ free0 ] ) with respect to @xmath38 results , finally , in the desired equation ( it corresponds to the so - called volume approximation of the polymer globule theory @xcite ) for the equilibrium polymer volume fraction of the two - component bottlebrush : @xmath43    obviously , the finite equilibrium polymer volume fraction of the two - component bottlebrush @xmath44 , which is the solution of eq ( [ phi_bar ] ) , depends on the value of @xmath45 only and has a physically meaningful positive value only for @xmath46    the corresponding asymptotics read @xmath47{c}% \\phi=3\\tau-(27/4)\\tau^{2}+ ... ,\\quad\\;\\tau\\ll1\\\\ \\phi=1-\\exp\\left (   1+\\widetilde{\\chi}\\right )   , \\quad\\qquad\\chi\\gg1 \\end{array } \\right .   \\label{asym1}%\\ ] ]    it is worth to notice that in so - called hildebrand approximation @xcite , in which the value of the @xmath36-parameter for the @xmath15-th and @xmath48-th species is proportional to the squared difference of their solubility parameters : @xmath49 the effective @xmath36-parameter is always positive:@xmath50 where @xmath51 is the selectivity parameter @xcite . if the @xmath52 and @xmath22 monomers are compatible ( @xmath53 ) then @xmath54 .    to conclude this subsection we discuss the conditions of validity of our consideration .",
    "first , it is worth to notice that the bottlebrushes under consideration are quasi-1d systems .",
    "therefore , their equilibrium volume fraction stays finite even in the @xmath55-solvent , where @xmath56 ( here @xmath57 is the statistical segment supposed , for simplicity , to be the same for both sorts of the side chains ) .",
    "indeed , it follows from eq ( [ phi ] ) that in this case @xmath58 where we introduced the reduced distance @xmath59 between the neighboring side chains and the lifshitz number @xmath60 , which characterizes the chains flexibility . comparing eq ( [ theta ] ) and the first of eqs ( [ asym1 ] ) and taking into account that the condensed bottlebrush should be much denser than that in @xmath55-solvent we conclude that the first of the validity conditions reads @xmath61    on the other hand , the volume approximation ( [ phi_bar ] ) is known @xcite to be valid when @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the correlation radius within the globule . for dense globules ( @xmath64 or @xmath65 ) the condition holds always but for semidilute globule ( @xmath66 )",
    "the correlation radius is known @xcite to increase with decrease of @xmath67 : @xmath68    it follows from eqs ( [ phi ] ) , ( [ asym1 ] ) and ( [ rc ] ) that close to the @xmath55-temperature the condition ( [ val1 ] ) is satisfied only when the side chains are long enough : @xmath69    condition ( [ val2 ] ) is rather severe since both quantities @xmath70 and @xmath67 are small .",
    "thus , the fact that the monomer density profile usually observed in computer simulation of bottlebrushes in poor solvents close to the @xmath55-temperature is not step - like , which is expected for a condensed ( globular ) state , but rather smooth @xcite is explained by insufficiently high degrees of polymerization of the side chains , which do not satisfy condition ( [ val2 ] ) .",
    "to consider the fluctuations within the two - component condensed bottlebrush we are to expand the total free energy ( [ freel ] ) in powers of the density fluctuations counted from the uniform globular state ( @xmath71 = @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is defined by eqs ( [ freev ] ) and ( [ free0 ] ) , the quadratic term of the expansion reads @xmath75 ( in eq ( [ f2a ] ) and thereafter we employ the rule of summation over the repeating indices ) and the next terms of the expansion ( [ f2 ] ) are defined similarly @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this subsection is to find the explicit form of the kernel @xmath76 and conditions ensuring that the quadratic form @xmath77 is positive definite , which implies that the fluctuations are small .",
    "it follows from eqs ( [ freel ] ) - ( [ f_sp ] ) and ( [ f2a ] ) that @xmath78 here we introduced new designations @xmath79@xmath80 where the number matrix @xmath81 reads @xmath82{cc}% 2\\chi_{as}-\\phi_{s}^{-1 } & k-\\phi_{s}^{-1}\\\\ k-\\phi_{s}^{-1 } & 2\\chi_{bs}-\\phi_{s}^{-1}% \\end{array } \\right )   \\label{c}%\\ ] ] and @xmath83 .",
    "thus , our problem is reduced to calculating the second derivative ( [ gam ] ) of the structural free energy functional . for this purpose",
    "we consider an auxiliary thermodynamic potential @xmath84 which has meaning of the free energy of an ideal polymer system with a specified architecture ( in our case it is the two - component bottlebrush ) affected by a set @xmath85 of external fields applied to the particles of the @xmath15-th sort .",
    "the thermodynamic potential @xmath86 could be readily calculated ( see below ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is directly related to the desired thermodynamic potential @xmath87 .",
    "indeed , the partition function @xmath88 appearing in eq ( [ phi ] ) is the integral over all possible non - uniform density distributions @xmath89 of the particles of the @xmath15-th sort in the volume of the system : @xmath90 with@xmath91 definition and calculation of the density integral @xmath88 is , generally , rather cumbersome but it becomes trivial in the saddle - point approximation:@xmath92    it follows from ( [ field_pot ] ) that if the thermodynamic potential @xmath93 is known then the thermodynamic potential @xmath94 is parametrically defined as follows : @xmath95 @xmath96 eqs ( [ l1 ] ) and ( [ l2 ] ) imply that the thermodynamic potential @xmath97 , which is a functional of all external fields @xmath98 applied to the particles of the system , is the legendre transform of the thermodynamic potential @xmath99 , which is a functional of all number densities @xmath89 of these particles .",
    "therefore , the reciprocal relationships hold : @xmath100",
    "@xmath101    it follows from eqs ( [ f2a ] ) and ( [ l1])-([rl2 ] ) that @xmath102furthermore , if we define the structural matrix @xmath103 we obtain @xmath104      the derivation of the explicit expression for the structural matrix @xmath105 of copolymer systems under confinement is a straightforward extension of that in bulk .",
    "so , we remind the reader how the structural matrix is derived in bulk .    instead of calculating the density integral ( [ z ] )",
    "we consider an equivalent expression for the partition function @xmath106 of an ideal polydisperse @xmath107-component system of linear macromolecules affected by the external fields @xmath108 applied to the monomers of the @xmath15-th sort .",
    "the partition function @xmath106 can be written directly in terms of the corresponding discrete microscopic model : @xmath109 here @xmath110 is the macromolecular structure , which for linear chains is just a sequence of integers @xmath111 equal to the number @xmath112 of the sort of the @xmath15-th monomer , @xmath113 is the number of chains with structure @xmath110 in the whole volume @xmath24 of the system and @xmath114 is the partition function of the chain @xmath110 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is a point of the configuration space of the chain @xmath110 and @xmath117 is the distribution function of the ideal chain @xmath110 , the effect of connectivity being taken into account by the bond functions @xmath118 , which describe the correlations between the neighboring monomers of the chains . for simplicity , we assume that the bond function does not depend on the sorts of the neighboring monomers and has the conventional normalized form @xmath119 where @xmath57 is the statistical segment length . thus , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath120    the thermodynamic potential @xmath121 reads@xmath122 where @xmath123    additivity of @xmath124 with respect to the terms characterizing macromolecules with different chemical structure implies that the matrix ( [ gam_1 ] ) is a properly weighted sum of molecular response functions:@xmath125 here @xmath126 is the average number density of the macromolecules @xmath110 and @xmath127 where we employed the definitions ( [ z1 ] ) and ( [ def1])@xmath128 summing the second field derivatives of @xmath129 and collecting similar terms one gets@xmath130 where @xmath131 @xmath132 is the number of the monomers of the @xmath15-th sort , which belong to the macromolecules @xmath110 , and @xmath133 are the numbers of pairs of monomers of the @xmath112-th and @xmath134-th sorts , which are separated by @xmath107 bonds . the structural matrix , which was first introduced in the form ( [ gab ] ) by one of us @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) ,",
    "is a discrete analog of the expressions for the correlators obtained in the continuous limit ( like the debye function for homopolymer and the leibler expressions @xcite for diblock copolymers ) .    to calculate the structural matrix explicitly we rewrite it as the inverse fourier transform:@xmath135 where the direct fourier transform @xmath136 is an algebraic function of the fourier transform of the bond function:@xmath137",
    "the explicit finite expressions for homo- and some block copolymers can be found in refs @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now , we make use of the fact that @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the eigen values and eigen functions of the laplace operator @xmath140 acting in the infinite space .",
    "the natural idea @xcite to generalize expression ( [ rb ] ) for the structural matrix to confined copolymers is to rewrite it in the form of a somewhat more general series@xmath141 where now @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the full sets of the eigen values and the orthonormalized eigen functions of the laplace operator @xmath140 acting in a finite volume under specified boundary conditions and @xmath144 is a matrix - function of the parameter @xmath145 .    then the kernels @xmath146 and @xmath147 read@xmath148 which results in the following final expression for the desired kernel @xmath149 : @xmath150 with @xmath151 which is a generalization of the well known rpa equation for polymers in bulk : @xmath152    we conclude that the condition ensuring that the quadratic form @xmath77 is positive definite is that ensuring that the matrix @xmath153 has positive eigen values for any allowable value of @xmath145 .    in particular , for confinement in a cylindrical capillary of the radius @xmath9 the eigen values and the eigen functions of the laplace operator read : @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the radius - vector in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath156 is a normalization factor and @xmath157 is location of the @xmath158-th extremum of the bessel function @xmath159 of the order @xmath107",
    "accordingly , the quadratic form ( [ f2a ] ) takes the form @xmath160 where the coefficient @xmath161 reads @xmath162    for future comparison with ordering in two - component bottlebrushes under investigation we present here the explicit form of the structural matrix for diblock copolymers @xmath163:@xmath164 here @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169is location of the @xmath158-th extremum of the bessel function @xmath159 of the order @xmath107 , parameter @xmath170 is defined by eq ( [ val1 ] ) and we introduced functions @xmath171",
    "the derivation presented above for the confined block copolymers can be now extended to the tethered copolymers . for this purpose",
    "it is sufficient to replace the expression ( [ zm ] ) for the partition function of the corresponding confined system by that of the tethered system under consideration . in this paper",
    "we consider for definiteness the two - component bottlebrush consisting of @xmath19 pairs of @xmath21 and @xmath22 side chains regularly distributed along the backbone .",
    "the partition function of such an ideal bottlebrush affected by the external fields @xmath172 reads : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the number of side chains of each sort , @xmath175 is the partition function of an @xmath176-mer , which is attached by one of its ends to the rigid backbone aligned along the @xmath4-axes at the point @xmath177 and affected by an external field @xmath178 : @xmath179 here @xmath180 and @xmath181 is the bond function defined above by eq ( [ bond ] ) , the statistical segment length @xmath57 being the same for @xmath21 and @xmath22 chains .",
    "then the thermodynamic potential @xmath94 reads@xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184    additivity of @xmath124 with respect to the terms depending on different external fields implies that the matrix ( [ gam_1 ] ) of the molecular response functions contains diagonal elements only:@xmath185    on the other hand , @xmath186@xmath187 where we employed the definitions ( [ z_s ] ) and ( [ def_s ] ) . summing the second field derivatives of @xmath188 and collecting the similar terms one gets@xmath189 where@xmath190@xmath191@xmath192 and the kernel @xmath193is defined by eq ( [ def_n ] ) .    based on the previous consideration ,",
    "we should use for @xmath194 the representation @xmath195 with the eigen values @xmath145 and eigenfunctions @xmath196 defined by eq ( [ tube ] ) .",
    "however , unlike the situation with free ( untethered ) copolymers under confinement , the correlators ( [ gii ] ) for bottlebrushes are , in general , not reducible to the form ( [ series ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the quadratic form ( [ f2a ] ) does not take the desired diagonal form ( [ f2 t ] ) .",
    "fortunately , it could be shown that for the condensed state the correlators can be expanded in powers of the small parameter @xmath170 defined by eq ( [ val1 ] ) .",
    "therewith , keeping only the dominant ( zeroth approximation in @xmath170 ) term of this expansion one arrives precisely at the diagonal form ( [ f2 t ] ) : @xmath197 with@xmath198 where the matrix @xmath199 is defined in eq ( [ c ] ) and @xmath200@xmath201 with all parameters and functions defined after eqs ( [ g_dib ] ) .",
    "the general condition of the multi - component block copolymer disordered state stability with respect to microphase separation is well known @xcite . for block copolymers confined in a cylindrical tube and the condensed two - component bottlebrushes",
    "it should be reformulated as follows : @xmath202 where @xmath203 are the eigen values of the correlation matrix @xmath204 defined by eq ( [ g2bb ] ) given the values of the `` quantum numbers '' @xmath107 and @xmath158 characterizing the types of the angular and radial concentration modulation and wave number @xmath205 characterizing the wave length of the longitudinal concentration oscillation @xcite , and the minimum is to be sought on the set of all possible values of @xmath107 and @xmath158 and on the half - axes @xmath206 .",
    "accordingly , the condition , which determines the surface ( in the space of the structure and energetic parameters of the system under study ) where the uniform state of the latter loses its stability ( spinodal ) , reads@xmath207 where we label with asterisks those values of @xmath208 that actually satisfy eq ( [ spin ] ) .    based on the wst experience @xcite one can arrive readily at the following conclusions .",

    "the corresponding eigen values are @xmath222 for bottlebrushes ( with @xmath223 ) and @xmath224 for free diblocks in a tube .      substituting eqs",
    "( [ g_dib ] ) and ( [ g_bb0 ] ) - ( [ g_bbab ] ) into expressions ( [ l- ] ) and ( [ l ] ) we see that the functions @xmath225 are the same for free and tethered diblocks ( bottlebrushes ) in the case of a purely longitudinal ordering ( @xmath226 ) ( see the well known @xcite bold solid line _ 1 _ in fig .",

    "it is worth to emphasize that the location of the minimum depends only on the length @xmath176 of the side block ( which scales the dimensionless quantity @xmath228 ) and does depend neither on the grafting density nor on the value of the @xmath36-parameter ( temperature ) .",
    "this surprising similarity is due to the very nature of our approximation , which is valid only for strongly compressed bottlebrushes ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "indeed , in this case the entropic loss due to fixing one of the chain ends on the backbone is negligible as compared to that due to chain squeezing into a narrow tube , which is the same for free and tethered chains . for other concentration modes having no angular but",
    "some radial modulation ( @xmath230 ) one has @xmath231 ( see definitions after eq ( [ g_dib ] ) . in other words , for these modes the instability curve @xmath232 looks like that for the lamellar - like mode ( @xmath233 ) but shifted by @xmath234 ( thin solid lines _ 1 _ and _ 2 _ in fig .",

    "the lamellar - like mode is the only one for which the function @xmath239 reaches its minimum at a finite value of @xmath240 .",
    "moreover , in this case the lamellar mode is dominant among those with no angular modulation . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is only the square averaged amplitude of this mode , which strongly increases when @xmath241    the situation is rather different for the modes with angular modulation ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "the relationship ( [ lam- ] ) holds for these modes of free diblock copolymers in a tube also but for bottlebrush angular concentration modes one has @xmath243 in other words , the instability condition @xmath244 looks like that for the mixture of free blocks a and b but shifted by @xmath245 ( see the dashed lines in fig . 1 . ) .",
    "as described above , passing the instability threshold ( [ spin ] ) results in formation of a lamellar - like or janus - cylinders morphology depending on which function , ( [ l- ] ) or ( [ l+ ] ) , has a deeper minimum .        as shown in fig .",
    "3 , if the shift @xmath245 is small then the instability with respect to forming of janus - cylinders appears first ( with increase of @xmath246 ) . with decrease of @xmath170",
    "the shift increases and we arrive at the value of @xmath247 where both the lamellar and first angular modulated mode loose their stability simultaneously at @xmath248 . with further decrease of @xmath170 the lamellar phase becomes more thermodynamically stable .",
    "it follows from eq ( [ val1 ] ) that @xmath170 decreases when the distance @xmath20 between the neighboring side chains of the bottlebrush increases ( and , thus , grafting density decreases ) .",

    "thus , this variation clearly must be discarded as being due to somewhat insufficient preparation of the initial states .",
    "in contrast , fig .",
    "9b shows that @xmath380 develops much stronger order of uniform sign , indicating that this system shows a tendency to develop janus - cylinder type short range order .",
    "while at @xmath368 ( not shown ) this tendency is also present , though less developed , for @xmath369 ( fig .",
    "11b ) the ordering tendency is much weaker : this indicates that the effective @xmath381-parameter for phase separation between a and b at @xmath369 and @xmath382 may be too weak to cause micro - phase separation .",

    "this conclusion is corroborated by the concentration correlations ( fig .",
    "13 ) , which reveal neither a significant long range correlation in @xmath379 nor in @xmath387 while @xmath388 exhibits the development of very pronounced janus - type order .    for considerably lower grafting density , such as @xmath289 ( not shown ) or @xmath258 ( figs .",
    "14,15 ) the behavior is very different , however : both @xmath374 and @xmath389 do not exhibit much structure at high temperature , but develop an oscillation ( minimum near @xmath375 , maximum near @xmath390 ) when @xmath356 is lowered towards @xmath285 . for longer chain lengths",
    "( n = 50 , not shown ) the behavior is qualitatively similar , but the minimum now occurs near @xmath391 and the maximum near @xmath392 , and for n = 20 ( not shown ) @xmath393 has its minimum at @xmath394 , the maximum at @xmath391 .",
    "thus , there is a clear dependence on this weak correlation seen in figs .",
    "14a , 15a on the length of the side - chains . in @xmath395 there occurs only a fast decay to zero for n=20 ( not shown ) , while for n=35 a minimum develops for @xmath375 ( fig.14b ) and for n=50 this minimum occurs for @xmath391 , i.e. , these structures are strongly correlated with the structure that develops for @xmath374 .",
    "taken together with the observation ( fig .",
    "5b ) that the chains form a pearl - necklace structure , we conclude that typically the `` mass '' in the pearls is not distributed spherically symmetric around the backbone ( the @xmath4-axis ) . this feature is also suggested by visual inspection of the snapshots ( fig .",
    "5a , 5b ) , but fig .",
    "14 implies that it is not an accidental observation of some particular snapshots , but a statistically significant physical effect .    turning to the concentration correlation",
    "@xmath388 we notice that for high temperatures a rapid decay to zero occurs but this decay becomes significantly slower as @xmath356 is lowered ( fig .",
    "again the comparison with the corresponding data for @xmath396 ( not shown ) and n=50 ( not shown ) reveals a qualitatively similar picture ( for n = 50 the decay is so slow , however , that our choice of 2 m = 50 would not be large enough to avoid artefacts due to the periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "turning finally attention to @xmath378 and @xmath384 , figs .",

    "such a finding is quite nontrivial , and without guidance by the theoretical treatment of the previous section , would have been somewhat unexpected .",
    "moreover , it is worth to notice that the theoretical and simulation values for @xmath412 ( @xmath413 and @xmath414 , respectively ) are in remarkable agreement .",
    "since the theory is done for temperatures slightly below the theta temperature but very long side chain lengths , while the simulation is done for temperatures down to one half the theta temperature but rather short side chains , the agreement is perhaps better than one would have expected .    in previous work on cylindrical bottle - brushes with a single type of side chain under poor solvent conditions @xcite it was found that for @xmath415 clusters elongated in @xmath4-direction occur , which have a gyration radius of order @xmath416 .",

    "however , the trend seen for @xmath422 , which exhibits a growth for small @xmath205 with decreasing temperature for all the cases included in fig .  18 , indicates a tendency for local janus cylinder type order in these cases , while long range order clearly is not established .",
    "we have not included @xmath424 into this study , since the data for @xmath425 \\{fig .",
    "9c , 11c , 13c } indicated already hardly any interesting temperature dependence to be present .",
    "the data shown in figs .",
    "16 - 18 indicate that in the case @xmath426 density takes the leading role in the mesophase ordering of the cylindrical brush , and the concentration ordering adjusts to it , while for @xmath427 concentration variations along the backbone drive the mesophase ordering , with a strong coupling between density variations and concentration variations still being present . in this case , a periodic modulation of density along the z - axis still grows when the temperature is lowered ( fig .",

    "we interpret these observations as a tendency towards the formation of janus dumbbell - type structures .",
    "in this paper the microphase separation in binary ( a , b ) bottlebrush polymers with rigid backbones driven by decrease of temperature ( i.e. , variation of the solvent quality from theta solvents to poor solvents ) was studied , considering also the variation of grafting density along the backbone of these cylindrical brushes .",
    "two complementary theoretical methods were used , namely ,      the first approach has the merit that arbitrarily long chain lengths of the side chains can be considered , as well as infinitely long backbones ( so that end effects or effects of boundary conditions along the backbone do not matter ) . besides , the approach results in some explicit expressions for the correlation functions under study .",
    "however , the disadvantage of the approach is that it is basically a linear stability analysis around the homogeneous state , strongly nonlinear effects are out of consideration .",
    "the md approach , on the other hand , in principle can take both nontrivial correlations and nonlinear effects into account , but in practice ( to avoid excessive requests for computer time resources ) is limited to rather short length of the side chains , and also the length of the ( rigid ) backbone is finite ( end effects then are avoided by a periodic boundary conditions , but the price to be paid is that reciprocal space in the z - direction along the backbone is discretized ) . also , non - negligible statistical errors ( and systematic errors due to insufficient length of the md trajectories , which affect the establishment of full thermal equilibrium ) restrict the accuracy of the results that can be gotten .    whereas the rpa treatment assumes that the monomer density in the radial direction perpendicular to the cylinder axis is uniform and constant ( up to the cylinder radius , while it is zero outside of the cylinder surface ) , in the model studied by md this assumption",
    "clearly does not apply , as has been shown in our previous work @xcite .",
    "rather , it was found that there occur density oscillations very close to the cylinder axis ( reminiscent of the layering of fluid particles adjacent to the hard wall ) , and for the chain lengths one can study only for a rather small regime of radial distances the density profile then is approximately constant .",
    "one approaches rather fast the regime where the density continuously drops to zero , similar to the density profiles across interfaces in phase - separated polymer solvent systems , where the density decreases from its value in the melt towards zero over a distance of several monomer diameters .",
    "this low temperature behavior in the simulation comes closest to the situation assumed in the rpa calculations . at higher temperatures , close to the @xmath55 temperature",
    ", the interfacial profile is so broadened that a flat region where the density has reached the melt density no longer can be identified .",
    "given the different temperature and chain length regimes for which theory and simulation access the microphase separation conditions , it is very gratifying that there is not only a good qualitative agreement between both , but furthermore the wavelength of instability towards the microphase separation agrees quantitatively between both .",
    "qualitatively , the analytical theory describes similar trends as seen in the simulation : there is a competition between microphase separation developing periodic order in axial direction , i.e. , the system tends to develop long range order with a particular periodicity ( the wavelength of this periodic modulation being controlled by the gyration radius of the side chains , while the strength of the modulation depends on temperature and grafting density , as the analytical theory compellingly shows , and as is confirmed by our simulations ) and microphase separation of the janus - type , characterized by @xmath440 ( the cross section of the dumbbell , depending on the ratio @xmath5 , in the strongly segregated regime ) .",
    "the theory shows that the instability leading to the latter type of order prevails if the grafting density is sufficiently high ( and/or the side chain length sufficiently long ) .",
    "both the snapshot pictures of the simulated bottle - brushes ( figs .",
    "4,5 ) and the quantitative analysis of the simulations in terms of the correlation functions of density fluctuations @xmath327 [ with @xmath441 and concentration fluctuations ( or their fourier transforms ) are compatible with such an interpretation .",
    "we emphasize that both the simulation and the analytical theory have considered a particularly symmetric case , where both types of side chains have equal length ( @xmath442 ) and also their number was taken exactly the same ( and moreover the same solvent quality was chosen for both types of chains , @xmath443 ) . clearly , when one would like to discuss particular experimental systems , these rather special conditions need to be relaxed . also , we have restricted attention to the case where the side chains are perfectly flexible while the backbone was assumed to be rigid .    for many real bottle - brush systems",
    "it is probably more realistic to assume backbones that are semi - flexible rather than completely rigid , and also the local intrinsic stiffness of the side chains may play a role .",
    "thus , the treatment presented in our paper can be taken as a first step towards a more complete description of less complex but interesting systems only .",

    "<S> when two types of side chains ( a , b ) are densely grafted to a ( stiff ) backbone and the resulting bottle - brush polymer is in a solution under poor solvent conditions , an incompatibility between a and b leads to microphase separation in the resulting cylindrical brush . </S>",
    "<S> the possible types of ordering are reminiscent of the ordering of block copolymers in cylindrical confinement . </S>",
    "<S> starting from this analogy , leibler s theory of microphase separation in block copolymer melts is generalized to derive a description of the system in the weak segregation limit .    </S>",
    "<S> also molecular dynamics simulation results of a corresponding coarse - grained bead - spring model are presented . </S>",
    "<S> using side chain lengths up to n = 50 effective monomers , the ratio of the lennard - jones energy parameter between unlike monomers @xmath0 and monomers of the same kind @xmath1 is varied . </S>",
    "<S> various correlation functions are analyzed to study the conditions when ( local ) janus cylinder - type ordering and when ( local ) microphase separation in the direction along the cylinder axis occurs . both the analytical theory and the simulations give evidence for short range order due to a tendency towards microphase separation in the axial direction , with a wavelength proportional to the side chain gyration radius , irrespective of temperature and grafting density , for a wide range of these parameters . </S>"
