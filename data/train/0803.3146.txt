    "the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe@xcite is one of the most important problems in both cosmology and particle physics which can not be explained within the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "inflation in the early universe @xcite , which is required in order to solve many cosmological problems such as the flatness and the horizon problems and to account for the origin of primordial fluctuations , washes out any preexist baryon asymmetry , so baryogenesis @xcite must take place after inflation but before the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite epoch .",
    "as for the physics beyond sm , one of the best motivated models is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite , because it can solve the hierarchy problem and realizes the gauge coupling unification .",
    "generic supersymmetric models have flat directions in field space where scalar potential vanishes at the classical level and their dynamics is very important in the broad context .",
    "the affleck - dine ( ad ) mechanism @xcite of baryo(lepto)genesis makes use of scalar fields having a large amplitude along the flat directions . in this scenario , the angular momentum , or the rotation around the origin , of scalar fields that carry baryon or lepton number represents the number density of the field .",
    "note that lepton asymmetry can be converted to baryon asymmetry through the sphaleron effect @xcite , which violates @xmath5 at the electroweak scale , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are baryon and lepton charges , respectively .",
    "therefore the source of baryon asymmetry in this scenario is large values of the scalar fields as the initial conditions and the phase difference between the potential minimum and the initial condition , which represents cp - violation .",
    "later dine et al.@xcite analyzed behaviors of the field that parameterizes a flat direction ( we call it the ad field . ) during and after inflation taking non - renormalizable superpotential of the form @xmath8 and susy breaking in the early universe into account .",
    "here @xmath9 is the ad field and @xmath10 is some cut - off scale . in this scenario ,",
    "susy breaking in the early universe induces both a possibly negative mass term of the form , @xmath11 , and cp - violating a - terms of the form , @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( real ) and @xmath14 ( complex ) are numerical factors of order unity and @xmath15 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the negative mass term assures the flat direction to have a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the difference of phase between @xmath14 and the coupling constant of a - term from hidden sector of the form , @xmath16 , which is a consequence of susy breaking at low energy , provides cp - violation .",
    "when the hubble induced a - terms do not exist , initial value of ad field in the angular direction is determined randomly during inflation and cp is violated spontaneously by the phase difference between initial phase of ad field and phase minima of the a - term from hidden sector . in this scenario , in both cases ,",
    "the net baryon - to - entropy ratio is in proportion to the cut - off scale and the reheating temperature .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that thermal effect induces an early coherent oscillation of ad field and suppresses the resultant baryon asymmetry @xcite .",
    "those analyses restricted only in the case where the configuration of flat direction can be parameterized in terms of one complex scalar field .",
    "there are , however , many flat directions even in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , some of which carry @xmath17 charge but others do not",
    ". therefore it is very important which flat direction , if any , is selected as the ad field .",
    "moreover , there are multiple flat directions which do not give rise to any f - term in the renormalizable limit@xcite .",
    "such directions can get large values at the same time and we can no longer parameterize them by one scalar field . if some of them carry @xmath17 charge and others do not , the degree of the mixing of multiple flat directions directly affects the net baryon asymmetry .",
    "it is not trivial whether the simple one - field analysis is applicable in such a case .",
    "the case where multiple flat directions have large values in the mssm and its extensions have been considered in the literature @xcite . in this paper , we improve the evaluation of the potential and clarify how final lepton asymmetry is determined in the multifield context . in particular , we highlight the difference in the origin of cp - violation between the single - field case and the multiple - field case .",
    "we also study how much pre - inflationary information survives after inflation .",
    "as mentioned above the general structure of the flat directions of the scalar potential in mssm has been classified by gherghetta , kolda and martin @xcite , but not all these flat directions remain flat in cosmological setting where scalar fields are expected to be distributed rather randomly @xcite .",
    "for example , if higgs fields have large values , only @xmath18 and @xmath1 flat directions remain flat and the other fields are driven to vanishingly small values . here",
    "@xmath19 is left - handed slepton multiplet ( @xmath20 is family index ) , @xmath21 is the higgs multiplet that couples to @xmath22-type quarks and @xmath23 is the higgs multiplet that couples to @xmath24-type quarks and leptons . in this paper , we concentrate on such a situation , which is similar to the case @xcite .",
    "we investigate the potential for these scalar fields in detail and estimate the net lepton asymmetry .",
    "we find that hubble induced a - terms play critical roles in both the survival of pre - inflationary information and the dynamics of ad fields .",
    "if hubble induced a - terms exist , our result for the resultant lepton asymmetry is consistent with the case of @xcite , but the dynamics of one of the scalar fields is slightly different . moreover , if hubble induced a - terms do not exist , there are almost no differences to the dynamics of scalar fields between single flat direction case and multiple flat directions case . in such a case , we must pay attention to the baryon isocurvature perturbation as is the case with ref.@xcite the structure of the paper is as follows . in the following section we present the relevant part of the mssm in which we are interested",
    ". then it is argued how cp - violating term is introduced and what is responsible for cp - violation .",
    "furthermore we show how multiple flat directions are mixed in our model and how natural we consider the case where multiple flat directions have large value . in section",
    "[ dyna ] , ad mechanism in our model is discussed .",
    "the classical evolution along two flat directions is studied . in section [ noa ] , we comment on the case when the hubble induced a - terms do not exist .",
    "we also discuss the baryon isocurvature perturbation .",
    "finally , section [ conc ] is devoted to the conclusion of the dynamics of scalar fields and leptogenesis in our model .",
    "we adopt a non - renormalizable superpotential of the form , @xmath25 in addition to the lepton sector of the renormalizable superpotential of mssm @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is right - handed slepton and @xmath28 is the yukawa - coupling for lepton sector . here",
    "@xmath10 is some cut - off scale , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are coupling constants and @xmath20 is family index .",
    "for example , if there is a right - handed majorana neutrino multiplet whose mass @xmath10 is heavier than hubble parameter , we can acquire the first term of by integrating out the right - handed sneutrino .",
    "we choose a basis which @xmath29 is diagonal .",
    "note that this superpotential gives a neutrino mass when one of the higgs fields gets a vev , @xmath31 here @xmath32gev and @xmath33 .",
    "( @xmath34 means the neutral component of higgs fields . ) to realize inflation , we introduce an inflaton sector besides the mssm sector .",
    "couplings between the inflaton sector and the mssm sector arises only with the gravitational strength in the supergravity scalar potential , @xmath35 and assuming non - minimal k@xmath36hler potential , @xmath37 in addition to the canonical terms . here",
    "@xmath38 is scalar fields of mssm and @xmath39 is the inflaton , @xmath14 is a label to distinguish the scalar fields and we assume the f - term of inflaton dominates the energy density during inflation . note that while @xmath40 can not be forbidden by any symmetries , some symmetries of the inflaton forbid @xmath41 .",
    "the resultant potential for @xmath42 and @xmath23 during inflationary era is @xmath43 + \\left [ \\frac{\\lambda_h}{2 m } h a_h h_d^2 h_u^2 + \\mathrm{h.c . }",
    "\\right ] , \\label{potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 s are real and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are complex parameters with their magnitude presumably of order of unity .",
    "terms including @xmath15 arise due to the coupling of flat direction to the f - term of the inflaton @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath41 is forbidden , the hubble induced a - terms , @xmath48 + \\left [ \\frac{\\lambda_h}{2 m } h a_h h_d^2 h_u^2 + \\mathrm{h.c . }",
    "\\right ] , \\ ] ] vanish .",
    "hereafter , therefore , we consider the two cases with and without hubble induced a - terms . in the remainder of this section and section [ dyna ] , we examine the case when the hubble induced a - terms exist . in section [ noa ] ,",
    "we discuss the influence of existence or nonexistence of hubble induced a - terms to the dynamics of the scalar fields and the resultant lepton asymmetry .",

    "@xmath50 and @xmath4 are masses of scalar fields and gravitino respectively , while @xmath51 and @xmath52 are complex numerical factors with their magnitude of order of unity .",
    "scalar potential also includes d - terms , which are @xmath53 in this case . here",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are the gauge coupling constants and superscripts @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the indices of the representation of @xmath58 .",
    "however , deviation from d - flat direction is strongly restricted .",
    "therefore we restrict dynamics of scalar fields into the space of flat directions .",
    "hereafter , we consider scalar fields parameterized as @xmath59 and , @xmath60 we can easily see that @xmath61 and thus @xmath62 by this parameterization and there remains no additional physical degrees of freedom . here",
    "f - term @xmath63 in ref.@xcite vanishes because of d - flat conditions .",
    "moreover , we assume @xmath64 in other words , neutrino mass matrix has a hierarchy . in this case , potential minima is located at @xmath65 and @xmath66 acquire heavy masses from @xmath67 .",
    "therefore only one slepton and two higgs have large vevs and other scalar fields set in the origin approximately .",
    "hereafter , we adopt a notation , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 representing the mean value of @xmath71 and @xmath30 .",
    "we now comment on cp - violation . in the case",
    "only a single flat direction has a nonvanishing vev , there are two phase - dependent terms during inflationary era@xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath9 is the ad field parameterizing the flat direction , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are phases of the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath75 , respectively . in this model , determines the initial condition just after inflation and determines the eventual potential minimum in the angular direction for the following dynamics .",
    "therefore @xmath76 represents the cp - violation . when @xmath77 , in other words when is negligible , there is no cp violation , and lepton asymmetry can not be induced because of sakharov s condition @xcite .",
    "as @xmath15 decreases to make the ratio of a - term from hidden sector to the total scalar potential for ad field larger , cp - violation becomes effective and lepton asymmetry can be generated . in our model , on the other hand , we have five phase - dependent terms during inflationary era , @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are phases of @xmath81 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "four of them are a - terms and the last one is from f - term . in inflationary era , , and are dominant and they determine the initial condition of scalar fields in the angular direction for the following dynamics . moreover , in this case , the time dependence of and change after inflation , on which we comment in the next section , therefore the potential minimum for angular direction is varied . in this sense",
    ", cp is violated strongly just after the end of inflation . in our model , therefore , lepton asymmetry can be induced just after the end of inflation .      in the remainder of this section",
    "we demonstrate the necessity of considering multiple flat directions .",
    "when a flat direction acquires a large vev , many other flat directions acquire masses from f - term .",
    "consequently such flat directions can not take large values , so that single flat - direction description can be justified . however , there are directions that do not acquire f - term from other flat directions within the mssm @xcite .",
    "the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is its typical example .",
    "the mass terms of scalar fields are @xmath82 neglecting soft terms from hidden sector . setting the d - flat condition , it reads @xmath83 if @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 is stable at the origin and we conclude that @xmath86 falls down to the origin and we can take the one - flat direction description .",
    "however , if @xmath84 and @xmath87 , both @xmath88 and @xmath86 are unstable and can not stay at the origin .",
    "we can no longer take the description",
    ". moreover , even if only @xmath0 direction is selected in the beginning , @xmath23 is unstable at the origin for large parameter region .",
    "we can see this by evaluating mass matrix for @xmath23 around the local minimum of @xmath0 flat direction parameterized as @xmath89 , @xmath90 the eigen values of this matrix are @xmath91^{1/2}. \\label{eigen}\\ ] ] as a consequence , @xmath86 is unstable around @xmath0 flat direction with a wide range of parameters .",
    "for example , even when @xmath92 , sufficiently large @xmath46 or @xmath30 can make @xmath86 unstable .",
    "( note , however , that too large @xmath30 makes @xmath93 stable . ) therefore , the situation where multiple flat directions have nonvanishing vevs is more natural than the case with single flat direction .",
    "in this section , we describe the motion of scalar fields and estimate baryon - to - entropy ratio . here",
    "we consider only homogeneous mode and neglect fluctuations around it because the curvature of the potential is much larger than the hubble parameter and quantum fluctuation is sufficiently suppressed in this case .    in the friedman universe with the spacetime metric , @xmath94 , scalar fields",
    "@xmath38 obey the equation of motion , @xmath95 parameterizing as , there remains a d - term , @xmath96 numerical analysis shows that this potential energy density remains small and that deviation from flat directions by this parameterization does not have great influence on the dynamics of scalar fields and the resultant lepton asymmetry .",
    "this result justifies our definition of the field variables with which all the d - terms except vanish from the beginning . if @xmath97 , the friction term is dominant and the fields are overdamped . on the other hand , if @xmath98 , the inertial term is dominant and the fields are underdamped .",
    "in inflationary cosmology , the hubble parameter evolves as follows . in inflationary epoch , the hubble parameter is approximately constant and we call it @xmath99 . as inflation finishes , the inflaton starts oscillating around its minimum and the hubble parameter decreases as in the matter dominant era , @xmath100",
    ". meanwhile the inflaton decays into other light particles gradually , and finally the universe turns to radiation dominant .",
    "note that the cosmic temperature reaches the highest just after the end of inflation as a result of partial decay of the inflaton even if preheating is not operative . as a consequence",
    ", we can not neglect the effect of the high - temperature cosmic plasma on the scalar fields even during the inflaton oscillation dominant regime@xcite .      during inflationary epoch ,",
    "scalar fields go to a minimum of the potential gradually . in our model",
    ", the potential is very complex and it is nontrivial how many minima our model has and which minimum is selected by those fields . if the number of e - fold is large enough , scalar fields fall into one of the potential minima because @xmath101 at the minimum . moreover , using numerical analysis we have confirmed that the minimum is unique except for gauge freedom and phase inversion",
    ". figures [ fig : one ] show typical example of the value where scalar fields fall from various initial values . setting sneutrino real by @xmath102 gauge transformation , @xmath67 and @xmath86",
    "are found to be on only two minima whose amplitudes are equal and whose phase differences are @xmath103 .",
    "what is important is that the values of the fields are fixed both in the angular direction and in the radial direction .",
    "in particular , cp - violation just after inflation arises from difference between the initial phases of scalar fields and the time - dependent potential minima in the angular direction at the inflaton oscillation dominant era . note that if @xmath104 , the potential minima during and after inflation are equivalent until the beginning of the oscillation of scalar fields around the origin . in this case",
    ", cp is not violated at large @xmath15 .",
    "the change of potential minima is discussed precisely in the following section .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     as a result , the vevs of scalar fields are fixed on the minima at the end of inflation , and following dynamics of scalar fields is independent of initial value at the beginning of inflation because quantum fluctuations are suppressed due to the large effective mass at the potential minima . in other words , there remains no pre - inflationary information .",
    "this feature is the same as in the one - field case .",
    "after inflation the universe enters the inflaton oscillation dominant era .",
    "the radial components of motion of scalar fields in this epoch are almost the same as in the case of single flat direction .    in this epoch",
    "the equation of motion is @xmath105 neglecting phase dependent terms , and reparameterizing as @xmath106 becomes@xcite @xmath107 this equation has a fixed point @xmath108@xcite , @xmath109 where @xmath110 are minima of the potential .",
    "this fixed point presents a solution which traces points that are a little bigger than the time - dependent minimum of the potential .",
    "the initial values are the minima of the potential and different with these fixed points .",
    "therefore scalar fields oscillate around the time - dependent fixed point with the period @xmath111 . due to the time dependence of the potential minima , the oscillations do not redshift away even in the presence of cosmic expansion . as a result",
    ", scalar fields decrease with time as @xmath112 oscillating around the fixed point .",
    "when a soft term from hidden sector , @xmath113 , or , thermal terms@xcite , @xmath114 dominate the hubble induced mass terms , the minima of the potential are at the origin and scalar fields begin oscillating around it . here",
    "@xmath115 is an index of fields which couples to flat directions , @xmath116 is its coupling constant , @xmath117 and @xmath118 is numerical factor of order unity , and @xmath119 .",
    "( @xmath120 is gauge coupling of @xmath121 . )",
    "when scalar fields oscillate around the origin , the amplitudes of scalar fields change with hubble parameter as @xmath122    figure [ fig : two ] shows typical time variation of scalar fields .",
    "the center of oscillation deviates from because the complicated mixings of scalar fields change the fixed points @xmath123 .",
    ", green dashed line is @xmath67 , blue dotted line is @xmath86 .",
    "the following parameters are used .",
    "@xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and reheating temperature @xmath130 is @xmath131gev .",
    "[ fig : two],width=453 ]    however , the angular motions of scalar fields are different from one - field case . for this purpose ,",
    "we first comment on the hubble induced a - terms in this era .",
    "the hubble induced terms in inflationary era , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , are from the couplings with @xmath134 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "these couplings exist even in the inflaton oscillation dominant era . in this regime , inflaton oscillates around the potential minimum with sufficiently shorter time scale than the motions of ad fields .",
    "the induced potential , therefore , can be acquired by replacing @xmath134 and @xmath47 with their time average .",
    "generally @xmath135 is dominant in @xmath134 because the linear term @xmath136 vanishes by time averaging , where @xmath137 is the fluctuation of inflaton from the potential minimum and @xmath138 represents time average .",
    "moreover , when the f - term of inflaton includes second order monomials of the inflaton , @xmath139 is also dominant in @xmath140 . as a consequence ,",
    "hubble induced a - terms have the same dependence on time as the hubble induced mass terms . since @xmath141 by the virial theorem ,",
    "the hubble induced a - terms can be written in the form , @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a numerical factor that is determined by the inflation model and here we assume that its magnitude ia order of unity .",
    "for example , if we take the superpotential of the form as a inflation model@xcite , @xmath144 where @xmath39 is inflaton , and @xmath145 is auxiliary field , @xmath146 is vacuum energy , @xmath54 is coupling constant whose dimension is @xmath147 , the important f - term is @xmath148 the resultant potential is @xmath149\\ ] ] in inflationary epoch , the vacuum energy dominates the universe , @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , the friedman equation reads @xmath151 after inflation , the inflaton oscillates around the potential minimum .",
    "as the potential minimum is @xmath152 we expand @xmath153 therefore , the f - term can be written as , @xmath154 , \\\\",
    "average of them , @xmath155 as a consequence , these two time averages are related as , @xmath156 and we can write the hubble induced a - term as , @xmath157 as the amplitude of ad field decreases in proportion to @xmath158 , the hubble induced a - terms fall off more rapidly than the mass terms .",
    "note that the inflaton @xmath145 has @xmath159-charge 2 and the k@xmath36hler potential of type break @xmath159-symmetry .",
    "here we assume that @xmath159-symmetry of the inflaton is broken by some mechanism of high energy physics .",
    "in the one field case , the change of a - term discussed above does not make the change of the minima potential in the angular direction at large @xmath15 and it is fixed until just before the beginning of oscillation around the origin because the effect of cp violation is very small at that time . as we commented in the previous section , in our model , the phase difference of coupling constant of two a - term , and yields cp violation .",
    "in contrast to the one field case , there exist phase dependent terms in the potential and the hubble induced a - terms . moreover the change of a - terms induces the change of potential minima in the angular direction .",
    "therefore scalar fields also start oscillating around the minimum in the angular direction as in the radial direction at the onset of the inflaton oscillation .",
    "the equation of motion for the phase , @xmath73 , of a scalar field @xmath38 , @xmath160 leads @xmath161 in this case , the relevant part of the potential is of the form of @xmath162 here we approximate that all the scalar fields have the same amplitude .",
    "therefore , the phases of @xmath93 and @xmath86 oscillate around its minimum without damping .",
    "the period of its motion is also @xmath163 .",

    "therefore angular motion of @xmath67 is fixed immediately .",
    "when the oscillation around the origin begins , the angular momentum is fixed to its value at that time because phase dependent term in the potential becomes negligible and it becomes the constant of motion .",

    "this constraint requires small hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "moreover , small @xmath263 , or small reheating temperature or small cut - off scale is required .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained three important results about affleck - dine leptogenesis via multiple flat directions with non - renormalizable superpotential and vanishing renormalizable f - terms .",
    "first , when multiple flat directions have negative hubble induced masses , we can no longer parameterize flat directions in terms of one complex scalar field and multi - dimensional motion of scalar fields must be considered . the scalar potential , however , has unique minimum except for gauge freedom and phase inversion if the hubble induced a - terms exist .",
    "therefore the degree of the mixing of flat directions is determined only by the shape of the potential without ambiguities , and the scalar - field dynamics in the post inflationary era are deterministic .",
    "thus in the ad mechanism via multiple flat directions with nonrenormalizable potential to realize the nonvanishing field values , there remains no pre - inflationary information provided that inflation lasts long enough . in the case",
    "where the hubble induced a - terms are absent , on the other hand , one of the physical phases of scalar fields takes an indefinitive value and its relative phase to the eventual potential valley acts as a source of cp - violation as in the case of single - field without the hubble induced a - term .",
    "second , there are cp - violation terms even for large @xmath15 due to cross coupling of scalar fields in non - renormalizable f - terms and the hubble induced a - terms . although the hubble induced a - terms decreases rapidly after the end of inflation , they can give angular momentum to scalar fields . therefore lepton asymmetry",
    "is generated just after the end of inflation .",
    "in particular , there is no suppression due to thermal effect @xcite .",
    "net lepton - to - entropy ratio does not have suppression factor @xmath177 , and the low - energy susy breaking mechanism , in particular , the gravitino mass , has practically no influence to the net lepton asymmetry .",
    "since the hubble induced a - terms play the critical role , the absence of them destroys this feature and the suppression factor @xmath177 is restored .    finally , in the case without the hubble induced a - terms , this mechanism generates the baryon isocurvature perturbation and observational constraints narrow the allowed parameter space . in particular too large hubble parameter during inflation",
