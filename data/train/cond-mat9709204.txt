    "in 1955 , in one of the first but well known numerical simulations , fermi , pasta and ulam ( fpu )  @xcite have observed the _ absence _ of thermalization in a nonlinear lattice in which the energy was initially fed into the lowest frequency mode . even if a lot of progress have been made  @xcite in the last thirty years on the study of the evolution towards energy equipartition among linear normal modes , several points are far from being clarified . for historical reasons , the evolution towards equipartition has been usually analyzed considering an initial state where all the energy of the system was concentrated in a small packet of modes centered around some low frequency  @xcite .",
    "only a few studies have been devoted to the evolution from an initial condition where all the energy was fed in the highest frequency mode @xcite . from these analyses it turned out that this different initial condition leads to a completely new dynamical behavior in the transient time preceding the final equipartition .",
    "in particular , the main finding was the appearance of a sharp localized mode during the transient @xcite .",
    "moreover , the highest frequency mode turns out to be a linearly unstable periodic solution ; thus , starting the orbit from this initial point in phase - space put the system on a hyperbolic point embedded into a chaotic layer . on the other hand ,",
    "when low frequency modes are initially excited , instability arises because of the presence of thin chaotic layers near elliptic points  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that the time - scales for the relaxation to the equipartition state and the physical picture of the evolution towards the final state should be strongly affected .    in this paper",
    ", we present a detailed numerical and theoretical study of the dynamics of a @xmath0-fpu model in the transient preceding equipartition , when only the highest frequency mode is initially excited . employing the quite recent concept of breather excitations@xcite ,",
    "we are able to give a more detailed explanation of some of the behaviors observed in ref .  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "we show that the existence of such localized modes during the transient is strongly connected to exact breather modes for the @xmath0-fpu model @xcite .",
    "an important peculiarity of these excitations is that ( contrary to exact breathers ) they have a chaotic evolution in time , therefore we have termed them `` chaotic breathers '' ( cbs ) .",
    "the fact that localized oscillating excitations ( that can be identified as cbs ) show up spontaneously  @xcite and persist in numerical simulations has suggested that they play an important role in the dynamics of hamiltonian anharmonic systems .",
    "however , an important point that should be clarified is why these objects emerge so easily in hamiltonian systems .",
    "since hamiltonian dynamics is reversible , large packets should break up into smaller ones at the same rate that small ones merge into larger one ; while in the formation of a cb the latter process seems to be favored .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this paper to give some clarification about these points and in particular to emphasize the importance of these localized excitations for the transition towards energy equipartition .",
    "another important aspect that we discuss is the existence of scaling laws for the indicators characterizing the approach to the equipartition state .",
    "we notice that quite general scaling laws indeed exist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "moreover , the relevant quantity for the equipartition time turns out to be the energy density .",
    "we have organized the paper in the following way .",
    "the results of numerical simulations concerning the appearance of cbs are presented in sec",
    ".  [ localization ] .",
    "the consequences of the existence of cbs for the transition to equipartition are presented in sec .",
    "[ transition ] together with the observed scaling laws .",
    "the relation between cbs and exact breathers is discussed in detail in sec .",

    "some final remarks and conclusions are reported in sec .",

    "denoting by @xmath6 the position of the @xmath7th atom ( @xmath8 $ ] ) , the equations of motion of the @xmath0-fpu chain read @xmath9 \\label{sub } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 can be absorbed with an appropriate rescaling of @xmath11 , but we keep it not only for historical reasons , but also in order to make easier comparisons with results reported in previous papers .",
    "we have chosen periodic boundary conditions which allow the propagation of waves in the lattice .",
    "as recently shown in @xcite , the study of the evolution of traveling waves with wavelength of the order of the system size ( i.e. @xmath12 ) can give very useful information .",
    "in particular , the average lifetime of such waves is strictly related to the time necessary to reach equipartition . here again , the propagation of waves and localized structures will play a fundamental role in the evolution of the system .    as usual , in numerical simulations one does not study the real hamiltonian system , but a discrete time version that approximates the time continuous dynamics .",
    "it is therefore essential for long time simulations to use an appropriate symplectic integration scheme in order to preserve as far as possible the hamiltonian structure of the problem .",
    "we adopt the 6th - order yoshida s algorithm  @xcite with a time step @xmath13 ; this choice allows us to obtain an energy conservation with an accuracy @xmath14 ( that corresponds to a relative accuracy @xmath15 ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ) .",
    "we follow the approach proposed by fermi - pasta - ulam in ref .   where they look at the stability of one normal mode of the harmonic part , but contrary to them",
    "we have performed simulations adopting as initial condition the highest frequency mode .",
    "the highest frequency mode ( the so called @xmath18-mode ) corresponds to the following zig - zag pattern for @xmath11 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is its amplitude .",
    "since most of the normal modes of the harmonic part of the hamiltonian are no longer solutions of the full hamiltonian , energy initially fed into one single mode will be shared on later times among other modes . however ,",
    "this is not true for three particular modes that are exact solutions of the fpu lattice  @xcite . as the @xmath18-mode is one of these solutions , in order to destabilize such initial state a small amount of noise ( of order @xmath21 ) has been added on the velocities .    as already shown in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath18-mode turns out to be modulational unstable above a critical energy @xmath22 , that can be analytically derived  @xcite    @xmath23    as for this mode , @xmath24 , we easily see that if @xmath25 the @xmath18-mode will be destroyed by modulational instability .    in fig .",
    "[ greyscales](a ) a generic evolution of the above initial state for @xmath26 is reported .",
    "the grey scale refers to the energy residing on site  @xmath7 , @xmath27 where the substrate potential is @xmath28 .",
    "[ greyscales](b ) , [ greyscales](c ) and [ greyscales](d ) refer to three successive snapshots of the local energy @xmath29 along the chain . after a very short delay ,",
    "a slight modulation of the energy in the system appears ( see fig .  [ greyscales](b ) ) and the @xmath18-mode is destabilized .",
    "later , as attested by fig .",
    "[ greyscales](a ) , only a few localized energy packets emerge from this temporary state ; they correspond to oscillating localized waves and are usually called breathers or intrinsic localized modes . at this stage ,",
    "as inelastic collisions of breathers have a systematic tendency to favor the growth of big breathers at the expense of small ones@xcite , the number of localized objects decreases and only one very large amplitude breather - like excitation survives ( see fig .  [ greyscales](c ) ) : this is the excitation we have termed cb .",
    "the cb moves along the lattice with a perturbed ballistic motion : sometimes the cb is even stopped or reflected . during its motion",
    "the cb collects energy from the visited sites on the chain , and its amplitude increases .",
    "it is important to note that the cb will never be at rest and that it propagates in general with almost the same speed ( in modulus ) .",
    "finally , after a very long time and through a mechanism we will consider later , the cb decays and the system reaches the equipartition of energy , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ greyscales](d ) .",
    "the main important aspect that arises from the above reported picture is that the dynamics of the model seems to favour the emergence of a well localized state ( cb ) during the transient preceding equipartition @xcite . in order to give a more quantitative characterization of the energy localization ,",
    "we introduce the following quantity @xmath30    as it can be easily seen @xmath31 is of order one if @xmath32 at each site of the chain and of order @xmath33 if the energy is localized on only one site . in fig .",
    "[ coherence ] @xmath31 is reported as a function of time for an initial condition ( [ pimode ] ) with @xmath34 .",
    "initially @xmath31 grows in time , indicating that the energy , evenly distributed on the lattice at @xmath35 , localizes over a few sites .",
    "this localized state survives for some time , at later times @xmath31 begins to decrease and finally it reaches an asymptotic value @xmath36 that is associated with a total disappearance of the cb . at this stage a state with a flat distribution of energy in fourier space is attained , i.e. a state where equipartition of energy is fulfilled . already at this point",
    ", it is important to remark that for @xmath33 greater than 512 , all the curves @xmath37 are almost coincident at any time .",
    "we discuss this point in sec .",
    "[ formationdestruction ] .    the asymptotic value @xmath38 can be easily obtained . in the limit @xmath39 ,",
    "the energy per site has a mean value @xmath40 , but with some site dependent fluctuations , therefore @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath38 can be theoretically estimated within a canonical ensemble picture , that allows us to derive an expression for @xmath42 ( more details are reported in appendix a ) .",
    "the actual @xmath38-value depends on energy density @xmath1 and lies of course between the two limiting values : corresponding to the pure harmonic case @xmath43 and the pure quartic case @xmath44 ( notice that both these values are independent of @xmath1 ) . as derived in appendix a , for @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath46 , in perfect agreement with the numerical results as shown in fig .  [ coherence ] .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the energy - equipartition state is preceded by a transient characterized by the emergence of a localized state .",
    "the main properties of this state and its relationship with exact breathers is studied in the next section .",
    "here we are mainly concerned with the identification of some general aspects of the transient . in particular , scaling laws for two indicators measuring the relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium are derived .    as a first indicator we consider a parameter in the fourier space @xmath47 that gives a quantitative estimation of the energy transfer among the different normal modes @xcite .",
    "the energy associated with the fourier mode @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , is in the harmonic approximation @xmath50 , where @xmath51 represents the linear dispersion relation and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the fourier transforms of the velocities and the positions , respectively .",
    "initially , all the energy is put in the @xmath18-mode , but as soon as the modulational instability develops also the nearest modes @xmath54 acquire a non - zero amplitude @xmath55 , these numerical results confirm a previous analytical derivation of the most unstable modes  @xcite . after this initial stage ,",
    "energy transfer from the highest modes to the lowest ones continues and the shape of the spectrum as a function of the wavevector is well described by an exponential @xmath56\\ ] ] where , at any time @xmath57 , @xmath47 is the slope of the linear fit in the lin - log scale .",
    "when the equipartition of energy is reached , the spectrum is no longer exponential ( in other words the slope @xmath58 vanishes ) .",
    "therefore , the slope @xmath58 is a excellent tool to follow the transition towards equipartition .",
    "the numerical results that we have obtained yield the interesting conclusion that the equipartition time is a function of the energy density @xmath1 only , as attested by fig .",
    "[ slope](a ) , where all evolutions of @xmath47 for various lengths are almost indistinguishable except for the smallest chain @xmath59 where finite size effects do appear  @xcite .",
    "let us remark that in the original fpu problem , with excitations of long - wavelength modes , the distribution was well approximated by @xmath60 $ ] . in that context",
    ", introducing the analytic continuation of the continuum field @xmath61 to the complex plane  @xcite , the slope was directly related to the imaginary part of the nearest singularity to the real axis .",
    "work along this line would probably lead to a similar conclusion in our case .",
    "the transition to equipartition can be investigated even more precisely considering the following indicator  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the probability to have an energy @xmath55 associated to the mode @xmath64 at time @xmath57 ; i.e. @xmath65 indeed , @xmath66 whereas @xmath67 is reached  @xcite in the energy equipartition state where all @xmath68 ( for a detailed derivation of the equipartition value @xmath69 see appendix b ) .",
    "thus energy sharing among normal modes will be detected by an increase of @xmath70 , which can be considered as the percentage of modes with significant energy .",
    "it is exactly what we obtain in fig .",
    "[ slope](b ) for various chain lengths .",
    "the main conclusion that we can draw from this result is that again the equipartition time is a function of energy density @xmath1 only , and therefore it is finite in the thermodynamic limit , although it may diverge in the limit of vanishing energy density ( see the following )",
    ".    simulations for various energy densities @xmath71 allow us to study the variation of the equipartition time as a function of the the energy density .",
    "in the low energy limit ( @xmath72 ) , a good data collapse is obtained if the time is rescaled by a typical time scale @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ timeq ] ( a ) ) . at high energy ( @xmath74 )",
    "the typical time scale is @xmath75 , as it is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ timeq ] ( b ) .",
    "let us also stress that @xmath1 was also found to be the relevant dependence of the largest lyapunov exponent in the equipartition state  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the maximal lyapunov exponent shows two scaling laws at high and low energy density that coincide with those here reported for the equipartition time ( namely , for its inverse )  @xcite .",
    "however , while for the lyapunov the transition from one regime to the other is observed at @xmath76 @xcite , for the equipartition time the transition occurs at higher energy : @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "power law divergences of the relaxation time have been recently reported for several models of nonlinear oscillators and for different classes of initial conditions @xcite , although the large @xmath33 limit has not been studied as carefully as in the present paper .",
    "in the present section , we would like to pay attention to the localized objects observed during the transient state , and study their relationship with the already known localized solutions of nonlinear lattices , that we call _ exact _ breathers .",
    "we have seen that the energy contained in a cb ( and thus its frequency ) can be very high .",
    "for example , in chains of @xmath79 sites , we found breathers with frequency @xmath80 ( when the maximal frequency associated to the phonon band is 2 ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that the usually adopted nonlinear schrdinger approximation  @xcite is not appropriate to describe these objects .",
    "the unstable @xmath18-mode gives rise spontaneously to a localized breather - like excitation , qualitatively very similar to the exact breathers obtained for the fpu chain@xcite .",
    "the most evident difference is that the former move in an erratic way in the lattice and have a finite lifetime , while the latter are exactly periodic and mainly static .",
    "therefore it is natural to try to determine to what extent it is possible to compare them .",
    "another important difference between the self - created excitation and the exact breathers concerns their dynamical stability , which has been investigated with the aid of a lyapunov analysis . on one hand",
    "exact breathers are linearly stable and remain perfectly unchanged during very long simulations . on the other hand , we show here that cbs are strongly chaotic .    in",
    "order to compute the lyapunov exponents of the system , we have used the standard algorithm of benettin _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "however , we are here interested in the lyapunov exponents at _ short times _ instead of the asymptotic ones .",
    "we evaluate the cumulative average corresponding to such exponents as a function of time . in fig .",
    "[ cohlyap ] , the evolution of the localization parameter @xmath37 is reported ( panel ( a ) ) together with the corresponding cumulative average for the first four lyapunov exponents ( panel ( b ) ) for a typical evolution starting from an unstable @xmath18-mode .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ cohlyap](b ) that the localized object , which has spontaneously appeared , is chaotic because its presence ( indicated by the peak in @xmath37 ) is associated with a positive maximal lyapunov exponent .",
    "moreover , another typical feature of the cb is that the running average for the maximal lyapunov exponent has an higher value during the transient than in the equipartition state .",
    "the evolution of this running average is quite similar to that of @xmath37 : there is an initial growth followed by a decrease at later times .",
    "naively , one would usually expect that an higher degree of chaoticity should be related to a higher degree of energy equipartition : the present simulations clearly shows the opposite .",
    "one should stress that the running average for the lyapunov exponents relaxes very slowly to the asymptotic value , because its value is affected by the estimation at earlier times . a more efficient method to obtain the asymptotic lyapunov exponents",
    "is therefore to restart the running averages _ after _ the transition to equipartition state ( i.e. after the decrease of @xmath31 ) .",
    "the dash - triple dotted line of fig .  [ cohlyap](b ) shows that the convergence is much faster if this is done .",
    "another interesting result is the fact that a gap is present in the distribution of the lyapunov exponents during the transient : the first lyapunov is clearly above the others whereas , when the system reaches the energy equipartition state , the gap disappears ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ cohlyap](b ) ) and the whole spectrum of lyapunov exponents is approximately linear  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a measure of the localization of the lyapunov vectors shows that during the transient the first lyapunov vector is localized contrary to all others .",
    "this localization of the lyapunov vector disappears after that the equipartition is reached , since the energy density is below the strong stochasticity threshold , see  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is to see whether this peculiar structure of the tangent space ( i.e. the gap in the spectrum and the localization of the first lyapunov vector ) can be related to the properties of exact breathers .",
    "let us briefly recall that exact discrete breathers are time - periodic and spatially exponentially localized solutions of the equations of motion  ( [ sub ] ) .",
    "their frequency is always higher than the frequency of the top of the phonon band .",
    "calculating such a solution is equivalent to looking for a fixed point of the stroboscopic @xmath81 map @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the period of the solution .",
    "this can be done with the aid of a newton process , using the tangent map @xmath84 .",
    "the latter relates linearly an initial perturbation @xmath85 to its image @xmath86 where the perturbations @xmath87 evolve according to the @xmath33 linearized equations of motion @xmath88(\\epsilon_{n+1 } -\\epsilon_n ) - \\left[1 + 3\\beta(u_n - u_{n-1})^2\\right](\\epsilon_n -\\epsilon_{n-1}).\\ ] ] starting from a sufficiently good approximation , the newton method converges to a periodic solution , satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : period ] ) up to machine precision@xcite .",
    "one can then investigate the linear stability of the breather solution with a standard floquet analysis , i.e. computing the eigenvalues of the @xmath89 matrix @xmath84 ( a periodic solution is linearly stable when all eigenvalues lie on the unit circle of the complex plane ) .",
    "the main results concerning exact breathers in the fpu chain can be summarized as follows .",
    "they exist for every frequency above the phonon band ; moreover the spatially antisymmetric solutions ( centered between two particles , as the generic example plotted in fig .",
    "[ breather](a ) and sometimes called @xmath90-modes  @xcite ) are linearly stable , while the symmetric ( the @xmath91-modes@xcite ) are unstable .",
    "the spectrum of the floquet matrix , discussed in detail in @xcite , consists of a `` continuum '' of spatially extended eigenmodes ( the linear phonons ) and a discrete part with a spatially symmetric and exponentially localized mode . due to the time reversibility of the solution ,",
    "the real axis is a symmetry axis of the spectrum ( if @xmath92 is an eigenvalue of @xmath84 , then @xmath93 is also an eigenvalue ) .",
    "[ breather](b ) shows schematically half of the spectrum ( the other half is its complex conjugate ) with the continuum and the discrete localized mode . as the problem is solved for a _",
    "finite _ chain , the continuum corresponds in reality to @xmath94 modes with a higher density of modes close to the end of the band .",
    "such linear modes out of the phonon band and with opposite symmetry to the original solution , have been observed and studied in the framework of klein - gordon chains .",
    "they are called _ pinning _ or _ translation _ modes @xcite .",
    "indeed , an excitation of the periodic solution in the direction of this mode produces an oscillation of the center of energy or can even lead to a propagation of the solution along the chain without radiative decay .",
    "we have checked that these features are also present in the @xmath0-fpu model .",
    "the problem now is to link these exact solutions with the self - created excitations which have been observed in the simulations .",
    "the essential difference is that the former are linearly stable while the latter are strongly chaotic .",
    "however the comparison of the lyapunov spectrum of the cb and the floquet spectrum of the exact breather solution shows strong similarities : they both present a `` continuum '' of extended states and an isolated spatially localized mode .",
    "a quite natural hypothesis is that non - zero perturbations of the exact breather could lead to a strong destabilization of the translation mode .",
    "if this is true , one can understand why this instability is not destructive for the breather : a perturbation along this direction only leads to a coherent displacement of the breather and in addition , it explains why , in the simulations , the non - linear excitation is very seldom static .    in order to verify that the most unstable direction corresponds to the translation mode of the exact solution",
    ", we have performed the following test .",
    "we study the evolution of an exact solution , once it has been perturbed with a spatially antisymmetric gaussian noise all over the lattice .",
    "the antisymmetry of the initial condition allows the breather to remain at rest centered between two sites and this simplifies the comparison .",
    "the lyapunov analysis reveals that the perturbed state is now chaotic .",
    "the maximal lyapunov eigenvector associated with the perturbed solution and the floquet vector corresponding to the translational mode for the unperturbed case are shown in fig .",
    "the two vectors are both symmetric and in perfect agreement .",
    "this is a convincing evidence that the structure of the tangent space of a cb can be qualitatively interpreted in terms of the floquet spectrum of `` neighboring '' exact periodic solutions .",
    "we would like to stress that the fact that breather - like excitations move is not a sufficient condition for their chaoticity .",
    "similarly to what has already been found numerically for klein - gordon chains  @xcite , many exact mobile breather solutions can be exhibited by the fpu model ( see @xcite or @xcite for a discussion on approximations of moving breathers ) .",
    "such solutions satisfy the relation @xmath95 where @xmath81 , the inverse of the velocity , is a multiple of the period of internal vibration of the breather .",
    "one should also note that a small amplitude phonon tail dresses these solutions , such that one can consider that the breather is in equilibrium with the emitted and the absorbed radiation ( for more details see ref .",
    "many of these solutions are linearly stable and were checked to have zero maximal lyapunov exponent ; the chaotic regime is reached only if the whole system is sufficiently perturbed .",
    "the direction of the translation mode is easily excitable , but is not the direction responsible for chaoticity : thus mobile breathers are not necessarily chaotic and strong chaos occurs only when other modes are sufficiently excited .",
    "at this stage , we have understood the connection of the cb with exact fpu breathers but we should explain how the destabilization of the @xmath18-mode can lead to only one localized solution . indeed , as attested by fig .  [ greyscales](a ) , the modulational instability gives rise first to a few packets of energy but then , because of their interactions , energy is concentrated in only one .      in order to study this effect in a controlled manner ,",
    "we have put four exact breathers on the lattice : three moving ones with small amplitude and a frequency @xmath96 , that is just above the phonons upper band edge ( @xmath97 ) , and one at rest with a larger amplitude and a frequency @xmath98 . as shown in fig .  [ merging ] ,",
    "due to collisions , the biggest breather successively absorbs the smaller ones and gives rise to a moving large amplitude breather - like excitation .",
    "such a result is a generic example of the collision process in the fpu chain and it explains why a single localized cb emerges during the transient .    let us emphasize that even if some localization processes have already been reported in homogeneous nonlinear lattices  @xcite , the process presented here is particularly interesting because of the absence of the self - regulation process . indeed , in the klein - gordon systems studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the process is regulated by a stronger pinning effect .",
    "discreteness provides a path to localization but is also responsible for the pinning effect .",
    "this is stronger for larger excitations ( big breathers are easier trapped ) , and this does not allow a collapse of all the breathers into a single very large excitation . for the fpu model , pinning effects are perhaps too small to be detected .",
    "moreover , we have observed that the velocity of the cb slightly increases with its energy . as a consequence ,",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ greyscales ] the emergence of only one large amplitude breather - like excitation from the initial @xmath18-mode .",
    "is this effect present also in the thermodynamic limit ? as the lifetime @xmath99 and the velocity @xmath100 of a cb are finite , one could predict that , for very long chains , the cb will probably not have enough time to collect all the energy present in the system .",
    "if , in small chains , the breather could easily move through the system many times , in very long chains this would not be the case .",
    "one can expect that above a critical chain length @xmath101 more than one cb will be observed in the transient preceding equipartition . to check this ,",
    "we have investigated the case with an initial amplitude @xmath102 for the @xmath18-mode ; in this situation the typical velocity of the final breather is @xmath103 and its lifetime is @xmath104 . from these data",
    "the critical length @xmath105 is @xmath106 . for chains @xmath107 and @xmath102",
    ", additional simulations have shown that this is indeed true : the energy is no longer localized in only one huge cb but in few of them .",
    "a long chain could therefore be considered as a juxtaposition of almost non - interacting sub - chains of length @xmath105 . and in each sub - chain ,",
    "one single cb is created by the modulational instability .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the observed saturation of the localization parameter @xmath31 when the size of the system increases ( fig .",
    "[ coherence ] ) .",
    "indeed , a chain can be considered as made up of 2 independent parts @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and one has @xmath110",
    "( @xmath31 is an intensive - like quantity ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ transition ] , the lifetime is a function of the energy density @xmath1 .",
    "thus the critical length of course depends on @xmath1 .",
    "one can define two different regimes associated to the growth of the excitation . in a first stage",
    "the main breather present in the chain absorbs the smaller ones by collisions .",
    "after this initial stage the growth slows down .",
    "this effect could be explained by an observation made by bang and peyrard for the klein - gordon equation  @xcite .",
    "they noticed that the energy transfer between localized modes depends on their relative energy difference : the transfer is less efficient when the energy difference ( or frequency difference ) increases . for our system",
    "we have observed that , after the first collisions , the lattice contains one big breather with a rather high frequency and a large population of high frequency phonons waves .",
    "the presence of the latter is due to the destabilization of the original @xmath18-mode via modulational instability  @xcite . correspondingly , the energy transfer - rate between the phonons and the cb is still positive but reduced with respect to the initial one .",
    "we want to stress that this second regime was detected because of the very small initial perturbations of the @xmath18-mode , since for bigger perturbation this regime can easily be missed  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in this paper we have concentrated our attention on the energy region just above the critical energy defined by eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) , where the fpu chain evolves towards equipartition on a very long time scale .",
    "once the localization process is finished , a very large amplitude breather is moving in the system and all the high frequency waves have been absorbed .",
    "the hungry excitation can not grow any more and this regime corresponds to the plateau where @xmath31 has reached its maximum . at later times , the excitation disappears and now we want to explain how this phenomenon can take place .",
    "we have seen that the effect of collisions of the cb with high frequency modes leads to absorption of the latter . during such a scattering process",
    ", small quantities of energy radiate towards low frequency modes . therefore , after the initial stage the only phonons left in the system are the low frequency ones .",
    "it is natural to suspect that the destruction of the cb is related to their interaction with the low frequency modes .    in order to understand this interaction ,",
    "we have performed numerical experiments where one exact breather initially at rest collides with the following wave packets of low frequency phonons centered on the site @xmath111 :    @xmath112    we have taken @xmath113 , @xmath114 and an amplitude @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "[ destruction ] shows that the collision process is very efficient in destroying the cb excitation .",

    "[ destruction](a ) , the decrease of the energy of the breather @xmath116 can be considered as linear at the earlier times with a good approximation . moreover",
    ", a more detailed study of the phenomenon shows that the amplitude of the wave packet determines the destruction rate . in particular",
    ", the slope of the decrease of @xmath116 is an exponential function of the amplitude .",
    "this result suggests that a very complicated nonlinear mechanism is at the origin of the interaction . to give a more quantitative explanation we should study the scattering on one phonon with the cb as done by cretegny et al@xcite for exact breathers at rest in the klein - gordon model .",
    "however , here , the study will be much more complicated because small perturbations will easily put the fpu - breather in motion .",
    "a possible explanation of the cbs metastability is the following : at the beginning of the simulation , when only the @xmath18-mode is excited , and even during the modulational instability process , the low frequency phonons are not present . during the growing process of the cb the low frequency phonon band",
    "is populated due to radiative processes .",
    "when all the high frequency phonons have been absorbed by the cb , the excitation can only loose energy due to the destructive interaction with the low frequency phonons .",
    "therefore , we can say that the cb `` die of starvation '' .",
    "the destruction of the cb is associated with a significant increase in the population of low frequency linear waves .",
    "this transition corresponds to the final decrease of the slope @xmath47 plotted on fig .",
    "[ slope ] and to the final relaxation to the equipartition state .",
    "we have seen that the evolution towards equipartition in the @xmath0-fpu chain , starting from the @xmath18-mode as initial condition , gives rise to a striking localization process .",
    "the spontaneously created excitations are moving breather - like excitations with a finite lifetime and a chaotic dynamics .",
    "the features of these transient localized modes can be explained by exploiting the correspondence with exact breathers .",
    "we want also to stress that , contrary to the previous belief , we have found that the localization mechanism originally obtained in the klein - gordon case  @xcite , is also a transient state : the breathers obtained by collisions have a very long lifetime but are indeed cbs as characterized by the local lyapunov exponent .",
    "the lifetime of the process is however much longer in this case , because pinning effects on the excitation are stronger .",
    "it is important to recall that the fpu equation was at the origin of the rediscovery of the soliton  @xcite in the continuum limit , which justified the recurrence phenomenon observed by fermi - pasta - ulam  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the present paper , we have shown the fundamental role played by a second family of excitations , the breathers , in achieving the equipartition state on a discrete fpu lattice .",
    "the creation of a cb can be considered as an efficient mechanism to transfer energy from high frequency modes to low frequency phonons .",
    "let us also remark that the breathers are created from the high frequency zone corresponding to zero group velocity .",
    "this portion of the phonon band was also recently found to be crucial for the transition to equipartition @xcite .",
    "indeed , the transition to equipartition disappears if a renormalized fpu hamiltonian with a dispersion relation without zero group velocity region is considered @xcite . as in electromagnetism and string theory",
    ", the idea that this ingredient is absolutely necessary to observe the transition to equipartition of energy is another reason to justify a posteriori our study .",
    "moreover , we have found that the fundamental parameter for the dynamics of the system is always the energy density @xmath40 ( i.e. energy / volume ) . this is true not only for the value of the maximal lyapunov exponent ( as already noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) but also for the transient time towards energy equipartition .",
    "one should of course emphasize that this is the only parameter which makes sense in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , the transition to equipartition happens in a finite time in the thermodynamic limit , but this time diverges as an inverse power of the energy density in the zero energy density ( zero temperature ) limit .    as a final remark , this study emphasizes that the concept of a breather is not only important for the energy localization in lattices , but is also crucial to address one of the main classical problem of statistical mechanics : the transition to equipartition .",
