    "we calculate the gw amplitude due to the ns@xmath0wd  binaries out to cosmological distances and compare it to the sensitivity curve of lisa @xcite as well as the galactic confusion noise estimates from white dwarf binaries @xcite .",

    "for the older recycled pulsars , however , @xcite pointed out that this assumption is usually not appropriate , since the weaker magnetic fields of these objects mean that their present spin periods are only moderately larger than the periods produced during accretion . adopting the spin - up line from @xcite ,",
    "we may write @xmath18 using the above two equations we calculate @xmath16 for the two recycled pulsars j0751 + 1807 and j1757@xmath05322 to be 6.7 and 4.9 gyr respectively ( see table [ tab : obsprop ] ) .",
    "the remaining lifetime of a pulsar binary is defined by the shorter of the merger time of the binary due to the emission of gws , @xmath19 , or the time that the pulsar will reach the `` death line '' , @xmath20  @xcite . for young pulsars like j1141@xmath06545 which have relatively short radio lifetimes , @xmath20@xmath21@xmath19 .",
    "recycled pulsars , on the other hand , have far smaller spin - down rates than young pulsars so that it is likely that close binaries containing a recycled pulsar will coalesce before the pulsar reaches the death - line ( @xmath19@xmath21@xmath20 ) . for circular orbits ,",
    "the results of peters ( 1964 ) calculations for the merger time of a binary system of two point masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 with orbital period @xmath24 can be written as simply : @xmath25 where the reduced mass @xmath26 .",

    "j0751 + 1807 and j1757@xmath05322 , which have lower magnetic field strengths and hence longer radio lifetimes , both binaries will coalesce before the pulsars stop radiating ( i.e.  @xmath19@xmath39 @xmath20 ) , so we calculate their lifetime using @xmath8@xmath35@xmath16@xmath37@xmath19 .",
