    "the subject of complex networks has been widely explored in the past few years in part due to its broad range of applications to social , biological and communication systems @xcite . in a real world network , whether it be a communication network or transport network , the time @xmath20 taken to traverse a link @xmath1 may not be the same for all the links .",
    "in other words , there is a `` cost '' or a `` weight '' @xmath20 associated with each link , and the larger the weight on a link , the harder it is to traverse this link . in such a case , the network is said to be disordered .",
    "consider two nodes @xmath21 and @xmath22 on such a disordered network .",
    "in general , there will be a large number of paths connecting @xmath21 and @xmath22 . among these paths , there is usually a single path for which the sum of the costs @xmath23 along the path is minimum and this path is called the `` optimal path . ''",
    "the problem of optimal paths on networks is of import since the purpose of many real networks is to provide an efficient traffic route between its nodes .",
    "when most of the links on the path contribute to the sum , the system is said to be `` weakly disordered '' ( wd ) . in some cases , however , the cost of a single link along the path dominates the sum . in this case",
    "every path between two nodes can be characterized by a value equal to the maximum cost along that path , and the path with the minimal value of the maximum cost is the optimal path between the two nodes .",
    "this limit of disorder is called the _ strong disorder _ ( sd ) limit ( `` ultrametric '' limit ) @xcite and we refer to the optimal path in this limit as the _ min - max path_.    the procedure to implement disorder on a network is as follows @xcite .",
    "one assigns to each link @xmath1 of the network a random number @xmath24 , uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "the cost associated with link @xmath1 is then @xmath25 where @xmath6 is the parameter which controls the broadness of the distribution of link costs .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 represents the strength of disorder .",
    "the limit @xmath26 is the strong disorder limit , since for this case only one link dominates the cost of the path .",
    "there are distinct scaling relationships between the length of the average optimal path @xmath0 and the network size ( number of nodes ) @xmath27 depending on whether the network is strongly or weakly disordered @xcite . for strong disorder @xcite , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 for erds - rnyi ( er ) random networks @xcite and for scale - free ( sf ) @xcite networks with @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the exponent characterizing the power law decay of the degree distribution . for sf networks with @xmath12 , @xmath32 . for weakly disordered er networks and for sf networks with @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",

    "@xcite considered the optimal path transition from weak to strong disorder for 2-d and 3-d lattices , and found a crossover in the scaling properties of the optimal path that depends on the disorder strength @xmath6 , as well as the lattice size @xmath35 .    here",
    "we show that similar to regular lattices , there exists for any finite @xmath6 , a crossover network size @xmath7 such that for @xmath36 , the scaling properties of the optimal path are in the strong disorder regime while for @xmath13 , the network is in the weak disorder regime .",
    "we evaluate the function @xmath7 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sc ]",
    "we derive a scaling approach for the transition from weak disorder to strong disorder of the optimal path . in section [ sm ]",
    "we present simulation results which support the scaling ansatz .",
    "finally , in section [ disc ] we conclude with an analytic justification for the scaling of the transition .",
    "for a given disorder strength @xmath6 .",
    "the solid line shows the optimal path at a finite value of @xmath6 connecting two nodes indicated by the filled circles .",
    "the portion of the min - max path that is distinct from the optimal path is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "( a ) for @xmath8 ( i.e. @xmath37 ) , the optimal path coincides with the min - max path , and we expect the statistics of the sd limit .",
    "( b ) for @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath39 ) , the optimal path starts deviating from the min - max path .",
    "( c ) for @xmath40 ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , the optimal path has almost no links in common with the min - max path , and we expect the statistics of the wd limit.,width=302,height=188 ]",
    "in general , the average optimal path length @xmath42 in a disordered network depends on @xmath6 as well as on @xmath27 . in the following we use instead of @xmath27 the min - max path length @xmath43 which is related to @xmath27 as @xmath44 and",
    "hence @xmath27 can be expressed as a function of @xmath43 , @xmath45 thus , for finite @xmath6 , @xmath46 depends on both @xmath6 and @xmath43 .",
    "we expect that there exists a crossover length @xmath47 , corresponding to the crossover network size @xmath7 , such that ( i ) for @xmath48 , the scaling properties of @xmath46 are those of the strong disorder regime , and ( ii ) for @xmath49 , the scaling properties of @xmath50 are those of the weak disorder regime . in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] , we show a schematic representation of the change of the optimal path as the network size increases .    in order to study the transition from strong to weak disorder , we introduce a measure which indicates how close or far the disordered network is from the limit of strong disorder .",

    "the costs on the links for any path on the network typically differ by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "this means that for a min - max path of @xmath59 links ( or length @xmath59 ) , if we arrange the costs of the links in descending order , then two consecutive costs typically differ at least by an order of magnitude . if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the random numbers associated with two such consecutive links , with @xmath62 , then the ratio of the costs on the links is @xmath63 where @xmath64",
    ". thus , in the case of strong disorder we must have @xmath65 .",
    "consequently the transition to weak disorder occurs when all the links become equivalent in order of magnitude , i.e. , when @xmath66 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 depends on the length of the path . if the distribution of random numbers on the min - max path is uniform , then @xmath68 for a min - max path of length @xmath59 . the condition for the transition , @xmath66 is satisfied at the crossover length @xmath47 which implies that @xmath69 therefore , from eq .",

    "@xcite .    since there are @xmath126 clusters which include clusters of nodes connected by black links as well as isolated nodes , the mst can be described as an effective tree of @xmath126 nodes , each representing a cluster , and @xmath133 gray links .",

    "if we take two nodes @xmath21 and @xmath22 on our original network , they will most likely lie on two distinct effective nodes of the gray tree .",
    "the number of gray links encountered on the min - max path connecting these two nodes will therefore equal the number of links separating the effective nodes on the gray tree .",
    "hence the average number of gray links @xmath119 encountered on the min - max path between an arbitrary pair of nodes on the network is simply the average diameter of the gray tree .",

    "[ f.5]a .",
    "now we will discuss the implications of our findings for the crossover from strong to weak disorder . from observations ( i ) and ( ii ) , it follows that for the portion of the path belonging to the giant component , the difference between consecutive random values @xmath67 is given by @xmath140 .",

    ". hence when the min - max path is of length @xmath148 the deviation of the optimal path from the min - max path becomes significant .",
    "the length of the min - max path at which the deviation occurs is precisely the crossover length @xmath47 , and therefore @xmath149 .",
    "note that in the case of sf networks , as @xmath150 , @xmath111 approaches zero and consequently @xmath151 .",
    "this suggests that for any finite value of disorder strength @xmath6 , a sf network with @xmath152 is in the weak disorder regime .    in summary ,",
    "for both er random networks and sf networks we obtain a scaling function for the crossover from weak disorder characteristics to strong disorder characteristics .",
    "we show that the crossover occurs when the min - max path reaches a crossover length @xmath47 and @xmath153 .",
