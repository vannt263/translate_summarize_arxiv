    "the radio emission of core - dominated , radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is synchrotron radiation generated in the relativistic jets that emerge from the nucleus of the galaxy , presumably along the rotational axis of a central supermassive black hole .",
    "synchrotron radiation can be highly linearly polarized , to @xmath0 in the case of a uniform magnetic ( * b * ) field ( pacholczyk 1970 ) , and linear polarization ( lp ) observations can yield unique information about the orientation and degree of order of the * b * field in the synchrotron source , as well as the distribution of thermal electrons and the * b*-field geometry in the immediate vicinity of the agn ( e.g. , via faraday rotation of the plane of polarization ) .",
    "after a number of early circular - polarization ( cp ) studies for various samples of agn in the 1970 s and 1980 s ( gilbert & conway 1970 ; conway et al . 1971 ; roberts et al . 1975 ; weiler & wilson 1977 ; weiler & de pater 1983 ; komesaroff et al . 1984 ) , little observational work was done in this area until the late 1990 s , when the australia telescope compact array was optimised for cp measurements by rayner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and techniques for deriving cp information on parsec scales were developed by homan and his collaborators ( homan & wardle 1999 ; homan , attridge & wardle 2001 ) using the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) . the high resolution provided by these latter observations makes it possible to more precisely localize the regions of cp within the source , and thereby more accurately estimate the degree of cp in these regions .",
    "certain tendencies became clear from the very first vlba cp measurements : the cp was nearly always coincident with the vlbi core , with the degrees of cp typically being tenths of a percent .",
    "comparisons with integrated data obtained earlier indicated that the sign of the cp for a given source usually remained constant on time scales of decades .",
    "in addition , it became clear that cp could occasionally be detected in compact components in the inner vlbi jets .",
    "cp measurements of agn have recently made another major step forward with the publication of first - epoch cp results for the 133 sources in the mojave sample of radio - bright agn , which are regularly monitored by the vlba at 15  ghz ( homan & lister 2006 ) . of these sources , 34 displayed cp at the positions of their total - intensity peaks ( nearly always the vlbi core ) at a level of @xmath1 or greater , with the typical degrees of cp being a few tenths of a percent .",
    "comparison with 20 different optical , radio and intrinsic parameters of the agn yielded virtually no evidence for any correlation between the degree of cp and these other parameters .",
    "another exciting result of the first - epoch mojave cp measurements was that 5 of the sample sources clearly displayed appreciable cp in their vlbi _ jets _ , well resolved from the core , indicating that a cp - generation mechanism capable of operating effectively in optically thin regions was involved .",
    "we consider here the hypothesis that the parsec - scale cp is generated via faraday conversion in helical jet * b * fields in these agn , focusing on the _ sign _ of the observed cp , which has not been investigated in previous studies .",
    "we first examine the sign of cp generated by faraday conversion ( section  2 ) , then turn to the special case of conversion in a helical magnetic - field geometry ( section  3 ) . in section  3",
    ", we also describe our approach for using multi - frequency vlbi polarization data to determine the expected cp sign for particular agn in a simple helical jet b - field model",
    ". sections  4 and 5 discuss the data used for our analysis and our results : new detections of cp and transverse jet faraday - rotation gradients in several agn , and our remarkable result that the cp signs expected in our simple model agree with the observed signs in all eight agn for which the comparison was possible , provided their longitudinal * b*-field components correspond to south poles .",
    "the robustness and implications of this result are discussed in section  6 , and our conclusions summarized in section  7 .",
    "various possible mechanisms for the generation of cp in relativistic astrophysical jets are discussed , for example , by macquart & melrose ( 2000 ) , wardle & homan ( 2002 , 2003 ) , beckert & falcke ( 2002 ) and ensslin ( 2003 ) .",
    "incoherent synchrotron radiation produces a very small amount of cp at frequencies of several to tens of gigahertz ( legg & westfold 1968 ) , and the observed degrees of cp are high enough to make this mechanism implausible .",
    "a much more likely mechanism is the faraday conversion of linear - to - circular polarization during propogation through a magnetised plasma ( jones & odell 1977 ; jones 1988 ) ; although this mechanism has been studied fairly extensively theoretically and demonstrated to be plausible , the action of faraday conversion has not been directly demonstrated observationally .    in order for faraday conversion to operate ,",
    "the observed linear polarization electric ( * e * ) vector must have non - zero components both parallel and perpendicular to the * b * field in the conversion region projected onto the sky , * b@xmath2*. we will describe this electric vector using components parallel to * b@xmath2 * , * e@xmath3 * , and orthogonal to * b@xmath2 * , * e@xmath4*. @xmath5 excites oscillations of free charges in the plasma , while @xmath6 can not , since the charges are not free to move perpendicular to * b@xmath2*. this leads to a delay between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , manifest as the introduction of a small amount of cp ; the sign of the cp depends on the relative phase of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "unlike faraday rotation , faraday conversion does not depend on the sign of the free charges involved .",
    "a full mathematical description of faraday conversion is given by jones & odell ( 1977 ) ; we will be concerned here only with a qualitative understanding of the origin of the _ sign _ of cp generated by faraday conversion in a simple * b*-field geometry .    *",
    "to cp in a foreground field * b@xmath2 * for the case when the angle @xmath7 between the two fields projected onto the sky is between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( top ) and between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( bottom ) . from left to right , the plots show the relationship between the oscillations of * e@xmath3 * and * e@xmath4 * of the synchrotron polarization * e * vector parallel and perpendicular to * b@xmath2 * ; the relationship between * b*@xmath2 , * b*@xmath11 and * e*@xmath11 on the sky ; and the resulting cp that arises when * e@xmath3 * is delayed with respect to * e@xmath4*. the points labeled 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 refer to successive times .",
    "the total * e * vector rotates in the ccw direction ( @xmath12 cp , or right - circular polarization ) when @xmath13 and in the cw direction ( @xmath14 cp , or left - circular polarization ) when @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] [ fig : conv_sign1 ]    to demonstrate the sign of the cp that arises due to faraday conversion , we consider a foreground ( conversion ) field * b@xmath2 * , which purely for convenience of illustration ( to avoid our diagrams from becoming overly cluttered ) we take to lie in the @xmath16 direction on the sky ( fig .  1 ) , in a right - handed `` observer s '' coordinate system in which north ( the @xmath17 direction ) is upward and east ( the @xmath16 direction ) is to the left .",
    "we suppose that lp is generated in an optically thin background synchrotron source , and that the conversion delays correspond to phase shifts of less than @xmath9 . in this case , the key parameter determining the sign of the resulting cp turns out to be the angle @xmath7 between the synchrotron * b * field , * b@xmath11 * , and * b@xmath2 * , projected onto the plane of the sky , measured in the usual sense from north through east , as shown ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the observed linear polarization * e * vector will be orthogonal to * b@xmath11 * , since the synchrotron emission region is optically thin .    in principle , some amount of conversion is inevitable if @xmath7 differs from @xmath18 ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath7 lies in one of the four quadrants ( i ) @xmath20 , ( ii ) @xmath21 , ( iii ) @xmath22 or ( iv ) @xmath23 . as examples , fig .",
    "1 qualitatively illustrates the connection between the angle @xmath7 , the resulting delay between * e@xmath3 * and * e@xmath4 * and the sign of the resulting cp for the first two cases . in case ( i ) , the oscillations of * e@xmath3 * and * e@xmath4 * are in phase ( they have the same sign ) , and the tip of the vector sum of * e@xmath3 * and * e@xmath4 * moves in the counter - clockwise ( ccw ) direction on the sky , corresponding to positive cp ( right - circular polarization ) ; in case ( ii ) , * e@xmath3 * and * e@xmath4 * oscillate @xmath10 out of phase oscillate ( they have opposite signs ) , and the tip of the vector sum of * e@xmath3 * and * e@xmath4 * moves in the clockwise ( cw ) direction on the sky , corresponding to negative cp ( left - circular polarization ) . cases ( iii ) and ( iv ) are entirely analogous to cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "as has been mentioned by wardle & homan ( 2002 ) and analysed in more detail by ensslin ( 2003 ) , a helical jet * b*-field geometry can facilitate the conversion process  a small fraction of the lp from the far side of the jet relative to the observer is converted to cp as it passes through magnetised plasma in or near the near side of the jet .",
    "the angle @xmath7  and thereby the distribution of cp  will vary across the jet , but in observations with limited resolution , the overall observed cp sign should correspond to that near the central axis , provided that the overall jet * b * field is dominated by the ordered helical component rather than a chaotic component . the observed cp sign and distribution",
    "will also be affected by the viewing angle ; however , we are viewing the jets of radio - bright agn at angles close to @xmath9 in the jet rest frame ( @xmath24 in the observer s frame , where @xmath25 is the bulk lorentz factor for the jet ; e.g. , lyutikov , pariev & gabuzda 2005 ; cohen et al .",
    "2007 ) , so that this effect should not radically change the observed picture . in the absence of other propagation effects , such as faraday rotation of the plane of polarization",
    ", the sign of the generated cp is determined by the pitch angle @xmath26 ( the angle between * b * and the helix axis projected onto the sky ) and the helicity of the jet * b * field .",

    "these pitch angles correspond to the case when the longitudinal * b*-field component points along the jet ; if this component points opposite to the jet , the effective pitch angle will be greater than @xmath9 , and the cp sign for a pitch angle of @xmath27 will be the same as that for @xmath26 with the same helicity .",

    ", the fact that the detected cp usually coincides with the vlbi `` core '' is essentially a selection effect .",
    "the faraday conversion occurs to some extent on all scales in the jets , including on smaller scales than the resolution of the vlbi observations , and it is natural that the inner jet dominates the cp signal , since this is the brightest part of the jet . in addition , this effect may be enhanced by the fact that the * b*-field strengths and ( thermal-)plasma densities that determine the conversion may rise toward the active nucleus of the agn .",
    "it is interesting that cp has , in fact , been directly detected in the vlbi _ jets _ of 7 agn ( homan & lister 2006 , vitrishchak & gabuzda 2007 ) , 3 of which appear in table  2 ( 3c273 , 3c279 , 2252 + 158 ) . of these 7 agn , all but 3c84 , which is clearly an unusual object ( homan & wardle 2004 ) ,",

    "one natural question is how sensitive our results are to this assumption . in other words , for how large a range of angles do we expect to observe the cp sign predicted for a viewing angle of @xmath59 in the jet rest frame ?",
    "[ fig : sign_plots ]    to address this question in a first approximation , we have constructed two - dimensional plots of the expected cp sign for a hollow , right - handed helical * b * field as a function of distance from the jet axis and viewing angle in the jet rest frame , shown in fig .  6 . note that there is some physical basis for adopting such a model , since the thermal plasma giving rise to the transverse rm gradients appears to be external to the bulk of the jet volume in at least some cases ( sikora et al .",

    "is indicated in arbitrary units , with 0 corresonding to the position of the jet axis ( `` spine '' ) and @xmath60 corresponding to the two edges of the jet .",
    "regions of positive cp are coloured red and regions of negative cp blue .",
    "regions predicted not to give rise to cp because the projected angle between the background and foreground fields is 0 or a multiple of @xmath9 are white , while regions corresponding to the intermediate `` optimal '' angles for generating cp via faraday conversion , near odd multiples of @xmath61 , are coloured most intensely .",
    "these diagrams are calculated based purely on the angle between the background field @xmath62 and foreground field @xmath63 for a helical field with pitch angle @xmath26 as seen by an observer viewing the jet at an angle @xmath64 projected onto the sky ( this formula corresponds to a right - handed helix ; in the analogous expression for a left - handed helix , the pitch angle @xmath26 is replaced by @xmath65 ) :    @xmath66\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , it is important to bear in mind that they do not represent the actual intensity of the cp , merely the sign that should be produced for a specified viewing angle , pitch angle and relative distance from the jet axis . for comparison",
    ", we also show the cp sign distribution across the jet as a function of viewing angle for a pitch angle of @xmath67 and a left - handed helical field . note",
    "that , in this simple treatment , these images are point - symmetric .",
    "while these diagrams do not take into account a number of potentially significant effects , such as effects due to the propagation of the synchrotron radiation emitted at the `` back '' of the jet along the line of sight through the jet volume on its way to the observer , they nevertheless provide a useful overview of the expected robustness of our approach .",
    "we plan in future to carry out more complete radiative - transfer calculations of the expected cp distributions across the jet as a function of pitch angle and viewing angle .",
    "the approach we have used will be relatively robust if the predicted cp sign is constant over a large fraction of the jet cross section and for a fairly wide range of viewing angles .",
    "we can see that this will be the case for essentially all pitch angles that are not too close to those values that yield zero cp .",
    "there is an interesting selection effect here that helps make our approach relatively robust  the pitch angles for which there is a relatively small range of viewing angles corresponding to the cp sign observed for a viewing angle of @xmath9 in the jet frame are also those that give rise to relatively weak cp .",
    "thus , given the weakness of the cp signal , the agn from which we detect parsec - scale cp will tend to be those with jets whose pitch angles are far from these values , so that the inferred cp sign is constant over a wide range of viewing angles .",
    "despite the success of our approach for the eight agn considered here , there are limitations to its robustness .",
    "we argue above that the dependence of the cp sign on the viewing angle is not likely to play the most important role .",
    "we note as well that this first simple analysis has not included the effects of possible modest faraday rotation in the jet volume , which will affect the angle between the polarization * e * vector and conversion * b * field .",
    "however , the weakest link in the procedure we have outlined is probably inferring the pitch angle regime for the helical jet * b * field based on the observed polarization structure .",
    "in particular , there are other physical mechanisms that could give rise to a predominance of orthogonal or longitudinal * b * fields in agn jets .",
    "orthogonal fields can be generated by shock compression , and the longitudinal * b*-field component may be enhanced during shear interactions between the jet and the medium through which it flows .",
    "if one or both of these mechanisms operate , the associated * b*-field structure will be superposed on the `` intrinsic '' * b*-field structure associated with the helical field , possibly leading to incorrect conclusions about the pitch - angle regime for the helical field . however , the fact that our approach also requires that there be a transverse rm gradient across the jet , thereby providing direct evidence for a predominant helical * b * field , may help reduce ambiguity in the inferred pitch - angle regime due to these effects .      as is shown in fig .  2 , a right - handed helix with a south poloidal component will display the same sense of rm gradient as a left - handed helix with a north poloidal component .",
    "this means , for example , that the helicity we would infer in this case based on the observed transverse rm gradient would be incorrect if we assumed the jet base represented a _ north _ magnetic pole , but in fact it represented a _ south _ pole .",
    "therefore , if statistically equal numbers of the approaching jets in the 8 agn considered here corresponded to north and south magnetic poles , the sense of the poloidal fields that yielded agreement between the predicted and observed cp signs would have been north in roughly half the cases and south in roughly half the cases .",
    "since we have no other way to verify the sense of the poloidal field observationally , it would not have been possible to draw conclusions about whether , in fact , conversion in a helical - field geometry was the origin of the observed cp .",
    "however , our expected cp signs for south poloidal fields matched the observed values in 8 out of 8 cases ; the probability of this happening just by chance is less than 1% ( it is equivalent to the probability of flipping a coin 8 times and getting `` heads '' all 8 times ) .",
    "this leads us to conclude that our results provide evidence for a predominance of south poloidal components among the jet * b * fields .",
    "this does not seem plausible if the seed fields that are transformed into a helical - like field by the jet outflow and rotation of the central objects are essentially dipolar . in this case",
    ", each black hole would have one jet with a north poloidal field and one with a south poloidal field , which should be randomly oriented in space , so that there are equal probabilities that the approaching jet corresponds to the south and north poles of the black hole .",
    "however , another possibility is that the seed field generated by the rotating central black hole is actually quadrupolar - like , with two north poles or two south poles , such that the magnetic - field lines close through the equatorial plane . in fact , it has recently been suggested that such a quadrupolar * b*-field may more likely be realized for black - holes / accretion - disc systems in agn than a dipolar field ( blandford 2007 ) .",
    "our results would be consistent with this type of initial * b*-field configuration if there were some reason for a predominance of quadrupolar initial * b*-field configurations with two south poles , rather than two north poles . at present , however , we are not aware of any possible physical origin for such an asymmetry .",
    "despite extensive analyses of the degree of cp in previous studies , we are the first to consider the _ sign _ of the parsec - scale cp of agn . the new transverse faraday - rotation gradient and parsec - scale cp detections reported here have enabled us to compile a list of 8 agn with both cp detections and direct evidence for helical jet * b * fields .",
    "the perfect agreement between the observed cp signs and the cp signs expected if the cp is generated by faraday conversion in helical jet fields whose poloidal component is oriented opposite to the jet conclusively demonstrates that the observed cp is intrinsically related to the helical jet * b * fields in these objects . although the possibility of conversion - generated cp has been considered in a number of theoretical studies , this represents the first direct _ observational _ evidence pointing toward this specific cp - generation mechanism in the more than three decades since the earliest studies of cp in agn .",
    "this result has far - reaching implications for our understanding of the processes occurring in agn jets , since it suggests that helical jet * b * fields are common in agn , possibly even ubiquitous .",
    "indeed , such helical * b * fields can be produced very naturally through the `` winding up '' of a seed field by rotation of the central black hole and accretion disc , combined with the jet outflow ( e.g. meier et al .",
    "2001 ; kato et al . 2004",
    "; mckinney 2006 ) .",
    "the generation of a helical field requires the presence of a significant poloidal field , which can come about due to the jet outflow .",
    "the presence of helical jet * b * fields provides a means to collimate the jets , and demands that the jets carry current ( e.g. lovelace et al .",
    "2002 , tsinganos & bogovalov 2002 ) .",
    "thus , it is clear that we must view agn jets as fundamentally electromagnetic structures , although it is less clear from the available observations whether or not the jets are actually dynamically dominated by the associated electromagnetic forces .",
    "our results also appear to provide evidence that the initial `` seed '' fields of the central black holes are typically quadrupolar rather than dipolar , with a predominance of quadrupolar fields with two south poles .",
    "numerical simulations of the joint action of rotation and outflow on an initial quadrupolar field would be helpful in determining if there is a theoretical basis for this possible asymmetry between these two field configurations .",
    "an interesting observational distinction between dipolar and quadrupolar field configurations for the central black holes was recently pointed out by blandford ( 2007 ) : in the case of a helical jet * b * field generated from a dipolar seed field , the transverse faraday - rotation gradients for the approaching jet and receding counterjet should have _ opposite _ directions , while these two gradients will be in the _ same _ direction if the seed field that is `` wound up '' by the rotation of the system is quadrupolar . the observational challenge is therefore to identify agn in which both total intensity and polarization are detected in both the jet and counterjet on scales on which the transverse faraday - rotation gradients due to the helical jet * b * fields are reliably detected , and to carry out sensitive faraday - rotation measurements for such objects ( the apparent absence of clear rm gradients in fri jets on kiloparsec scales ( e.g. laing & bridle 2007 ) may indicate that the systematic transverse rm gradients are disrupted by chaotic or turbulent motions on these scales ) .",
    "we plan to analyze multi - wavelength vlba polarization observations for several additional agn with detected parsec - scale cp in order to search for transverse faraday - rotation gradients in these objects , with the aim of further investigating the relationship between the linear - polarization structures , * b*-field helicities and observed cp in agn .",
    "we also plan to consider the possible influence of modest amounts of faraday rotation on the observed cp in a future paper .",
