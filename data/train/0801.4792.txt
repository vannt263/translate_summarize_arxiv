    "the three dimensional ising model ( henceforth 3di ) is one of the main open problems in field theory and statistical mechanics .",
    "a large number of interesting statistical systems near the transition point are described by 3di and the theoretical methods suitable to deal with such a problem manifest deep connections in various areas of physics ranging from quantum information theory to string theory ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "besides its intrinsic interest in statistical physics , since the formulation of the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture @xcite , it has been widely recognized its role in describing the deconfinement transition in qcd . for this reason ,",
    "the 3d ising model is worth to be further investigated .",
    "it has been recently proposed @xcite to use in statistical mechanics the powerful tools of regge theory @xcite which have been so fruitful in the study of the strong interactions leading to the formulation of the dual models @xcite ( two detailed reviews are @xcite and ve74 ) .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that such ideas may be useful in dealing with the 3d ising model .",
    "it would be also interesting to try to test these methods in the mean field theory of spin glass as developed in @xcite ( recently  it has been proved , that such a framework provides one with the exact solution in the mean field ising spin glass @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we perform a numerical test of these methods in the case of the 3d ising model .",
    "we will try to find the best `` regge parameters '' appearing in the kallen - lehman form for the free energy : that is the parameters which provide one with the best possible agreement both at high and low temperatures montecarlo expansions as well as around the critical point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section the kallen - lehman form for the free energy of the 3d ising model is discussed . in the third section the issue of duality breaking is analyzed . in the fourth and fifth sections the comparison with montecarlo results at high and low temperatures are presented . in the sixth section ,",
    "the behavior at the critical point is described . in the seventh section",
    "some possible improvements are pointed out .",
    "eventually , we draw some conclusions .",

    "( [ errhigh0 ] ) , ( [ errhigh ] ) , ( [ comme2 ] ) and ( [ errlow ] ) ) .",
    "these quite small deviations obtained with @xmath11 ( which indeed is less natural than the ansatz with @xmath16 ) show that the present method is well suited to describe the thermodynamics of the 3d ising model . in any case , as it will be shown in a moment , the results for @xmath16 are quite better .    besides the first trivial term in eq .",
    "( [ trivial ] ) , the `` regge free energy '' depends on the temperature through an effective @xmath17 in the same way as the ( non trivial part of the ) free energy of the 2d ising model depends on @xmath18 : @xmath19the duality symmetry of the 2d ising model ( discovered in @xcite by kramers and wannier before the exact solution of onsager @xcite ) is manifest in the above function of the temperature since @xmath20 has the same expression when rephrased in terms of the low temperatures variable @xmath21 and the high temperatures variable @xmath22 .",
    "indeed , the 3d ising model has not such a duality symmetry : in the next section it will be described how the simplest duality breaking can be achieved .",
    "there are indeed many reasonable ways to break duality , how can one choose ? here a criterion of simplicity will be followed .",
    "an important ingredient is the following : all the ising models on simple hypercubic lattices are invariant under the marchesini - shrock transformation @xcite@xmath23while this symmetry is obviously realized in the 2d case in which one has at own disposal the exact solution , such an exact symmetry puts a strong constraint on the form of the free energy . as discussed in @xcite , the free energy suggested by the kallen - lehman representation",

    "a simplicity criterion ( which , as it will be shown in a moment , is supported by the numerical data ) suggests to consider the easiest possible modification of the @xmath24 of the 2d case in eq .",
    "( [ ka2]):@xmath25the fact that the exponential only depend on @xmath26 is the simplest possible way to fulfil the marchesini - shrock symmetry . the four parameters @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) are not independent since there are two conditions that the function @xmath29  has to fulfil : firstly , the maximum of @xmath29 has to occur at the known critical temperature @xmath30 of the 3d ising model:@xmath31the second condition is related to the fact that the expected transition has to occur @xcite when @xmath32 as it happens in the 2d case:@xmath33thus , in order to consider the simplest modification of the two - dimensional @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ ka2 ] ) , we will take @xmath35 ( the 2d ising value ) in such a way that only one parameter is left : @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be expressed in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath39 as follows@xmath40 .",
    "\\label{co4}\\end{aligned}\\]]from the numerical point of view , this parametrization is very useful since automatically ensures that the maximum is equal to one avoiding possible problems related to negative numbers appearing inside the square root in eq .",
    "( [ t2d ] ) .",
    "moreover the minimal modification criterion suggests that @xmath41as in the 2d case .",
    "indeed , one should expect a more general duality breaking : the 2d ising model and its exact duality are closely related to * * n**=4  susy yang - mills theory ( for instance see @xcite ) . from the gauge theory side",
    ", one would thus expect that a minimal duality breaking should be related to a yang - mills theory with two supersymmetry which has an effective duality ( for instance see @xcite ) .",
    "the 3d ising model is related to qcd without supersymmetries , so that it is natural to expect that a more general pattern of duality breaking ( which will be discussed later on ) should occur in the 3d ising model .",
    "however , it is a truly remarkable feature of the present tools that already a minimal duality breaking works very well in comparisons with montecarlo results .",
    "it is worth to mention here that the so called `` effective string approch '' to the 3d ising model ( in which duality symmetry is unbroken ) gives reasonable resuts in comparison with montecarlo data ( see for instance @xcite ) .",

    "\\label{kahigh}\\end{aligned}\\]]so our ansatz for the 3d ising free energy is given by eq .",

    "the best choice of parameters will be the one minimizing the following deviation function which , to some extent , represents the deviation between the ansatz and the monte carlo data : @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46where we keep the terms up to the @xmath47 of @xcite since our algoritm is not sensitive to the higher order terms , @xmath48 is the high temperatures montecarlo free energy , @xmath49 can be assumed to be of order @xmath50 one is not anymore in the high temperatures regime since the critical temperature is at @xmath51 which is only a factor of four larger . indeed , @xmath52 appears to be not enough smaller than @xmath39 .",

    ", we need to change variable from @xmath18 to @xmath55 , so that we have to use the expression in eq .",
    "( [ kahigh ] ) whenever it appears @xmath29 .",
    "the set of points candidates to be the best parameters are : @xmath56    in order to have a graphical idea of the closeness of the regge and the montecarlo free energies at high temperature we have drawn in fig .",
    "( fig - ht ) both functions .",
    "the agreement appears to be excellent : the deviation at high temperature is @xmath57    it is worth to note that in the range of parameters@xmath58we found many other good sets of parameters with only slightly larger deviations with respect to the montecarlo free energy .",
    "however , as it will be discussed in a moment , it is very difficult to evaluate the errors on the single coefficients of the expansions .",
    "thus , we simply considered the set in eq .",
    "( [ oht ] ) but other sets of parameters in the above range could reproduce better the single coefficients .     and kallen - lehman @xmath59 free energies at high temperatures versus @xmath60 . ]",
    "there are some points in the parameters space in which the agreement at low temperatures is much better than the agreement at high temperatures ( which is in any case quite good ) . in the present analysis",
    "it is apparent that one can not achieve an excellent agreement both at high and at low temperatures : in the best cases very small deviations ( of the order of @xmath61 ) on one side correspond on the other side to quite good but not excellent deviation of the order of @xmath62 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the already discussed fact that the 3d ising model , being related to qcd without any supersymmetry , needs a more general duality breaking .",
    "a consistency test would be provided comparing the derivatives of montecarlo free energy with the ones predicted by our model at @xmath63 . due to the complicated expression of the regge free energy numerical methods",
    "are needed .",
    "to this aim we consider the finite difference approximation of the derivative which , at any order of derivation @xmath64 , is given by the forward finite difference of order @xmath64 divided by the increase of the independent variable ( say @xmath65 ) raised to the @xmath64-th power , i.e. @xmath66(\\beta ) } { \\delta ^{n}}+o(\\delta ) \\]]@xmath67(x)$ ] being the @xmath64-th order finite difference . behind this apparently easy procedure",
    "there are hidden dangers which already at the lowest orders deserve special attention ( for an introductory discussion see @xcite ) : which is the best choice of @xmath65 in order to approximate correctly the value of the @xmath64-th order derivative ( since neither too small nor too large values are correct ) ?",
    "one can only try to find the suitable @xmath68 to reproduce the montecarlo coefficients at any order . in the case of the regge free energy it s always possible to find ( more than ) one suitable numerical value for @xmath65 .",
    "one can verify that the @xmath68 which reproduce the montecarlo results fulfil a sort of `` natural '' scaling ( see @xcite ) : namely , as the order of derivation increases , the suitable @xmath65 reproducing the montecarlo result stays constant or decreases . despite being only a first attempt to compute the derivatives of the regge partition function in zero ,",
    "nevertheless it is a quite encouraging fact that at any order one can find at least one @xmath65 reproducing exactly the montecarlo data .    another possible way to obtain the numerical derivatives for @xmath54 is the following .",
    "one can fit the regge free energy ( in which now the parameters are fixed to be the best parameters ) for small @xmath18 with a polynomial with unknown coefficients ( in which _ a priori _ one has to include all the - even and odd - coefficients ) in such a way that the coefficients of the polynomial are the numerical derivatives at the origin .",
    "however , after the first four coefficients are fixed , the polynomial becomes very close to the regge free energy .",
    "the higher order coefficients are fixed by the program to be the montecarlo results , but it is very difficult to evaluate the errors since if one changes the higher order coefficients of a factor of two or four the deviation with respect to the optimal polynomial is smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "even with this method , it is extremely difficult to evaluate the deviations of the derivatives of the higher order derivatives of the regge free energy from the montecarlo results . in any case",
    ", we find an attractive feature of our model that even fixing the first few coefficients at high temperature one obtains a good agreement at the critical point and at low temperatures .",
    "once the best set of high temperatures parameters @xmath69 have been found in eq .",
    "( [ oht ] ) one could hope to find a good agreement also at low temperatures ( something which , _ a priori _ , is very far from obvious ) .",
    "the internal energy at low temperatures is ( @xmath29 as in eq .",
    "( [ kalow ] ) and expressing @xmath70 as in ( [ trivial ] ) in terms of @xmath21 ) @xmath71 this is the average energy for spin ( the two expressions can differ by a non zero constant @xmath72 , see footnote 4 ) to be compared with @xmath73 ( the polynomial in @xmath21 representing the montecarlo average energy for spin for small @xmath21 ) found in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to discuss the origin of the constant @xmath72 in the above formula .",
    "the partition function of the 3d ising model reads @xmath74where the constant in the hamiltonian can always be chosen in such a way that the lowest energy state has zero energy .",
    "the ansatz ( [ parto32 ] ) has not been deduced by solving in some approximated way the model .",
    "rather , it has been found on the basis of the regge theory and the kallen - lehman representation : one can not pretend that it already corresponds to the normalization in which the hamiltonian @xmath75 has a zero energy ground state . at very low temperatures ,",
    "the free energies corresponding to @xmath75 and to @xmath76 differ by a term proportional to @xmath77@xmath78 -\\log \\left [ \\sum_{\\left\\ { \\sigma _ { i}\\right\\ } } \\exp \\left ( -\\beta \\left ( h_{0}\\right ) \\right ) \\right ] \\sim \\beta \\sim 1/t\\sim \\log u.\\]]in terms of the internal energy , such a term corresponds to a constant:@xmath79    from the numerical point of view it is extremely inconvenient to use the expression on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ parto33 ] ) since the derivative @xmath80 has a really big expression .",
    "a trivial but useful trick is the following : in @xcite one has a polynomial expression for the average energy for spin so that one can integrate it and obtain the monte carlo expression for the free energy at low temperatures:@xmath81this implies that@xmath82therefore , the low temperatures test function reads@xmath83@xmath84@xmath85\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we keep the terms up to the @xmath47 of @xcite  since our algoritm is not sensitive to the higher order terms and @xmath88 can be assumed to be of order @xmath89 .",
    "actually , the value of @xmath21 which corresponds to the critical temperature is @xmath90 .",
    "the low temperatures expansion provides one with reasonable results for @xmath91 .",
    "indeed , @xmath92 is not at all much smaller than @xmath93 : one may expect a reasonable value of @xmath88 to be quite smaller than is quite difficult because of the fact that the logaritm is very large and dominates the too small numbers coming from the montecarlo polynomial .",
    "if the logartmic divergent terms would be absent , in the region @xmath94 very soon the montecarlo polynomial would give rise to very small numbers ( below the precision of our pc ) .",
    "thus , to analyze this range more refined numerical techniques are needed . in any case",
    ", the good agreement at the critical point provides one with some control on the deviation of the theoretical low temperatures coefficients with respect to the montecarlo ones . ]",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the agreement is quite good up to @xmath96 .    eventually , the deviation at low temperatures between the regge and the montecarlo free energies _ evaluated for the same optimal parameters _ in eq .",

    "( [ fig - lt ] ) . as far as the numerical derivatives at @xmath99 of regge free energy , the same considerations as in the high temperatures case hold .",
    "namely , both a direct evaluation by means of a simple algoritm and to try to find the suitable approximating polynomial give results compatible with the montecarlo ones but it is not clear to the present authors how to estimate the errors on the single coefficients .",
    "it is nevertheless worth to stress here that the relative deviations both at high and at low temperatures are very small ( see eqs .",
    "( [ errhigh ] ) and ( errlow ) ) . furthermore",
    ", as it will be now shown , also the critical exponent is in a very good agreement with the available data : one may hope that the good agreement at the critical point could prevent too large deviations of the the kallen - lehman derivatives from the montecarlo data .",
    "the last test is the critical point .",
    "namely , once the parameters have been fixed as in eq . ( [ oht ] ) one may hope to verify that the critical point is correctly predicted too . to do",

    "@xmath107the agreement appears to be very good when compared with the recent estimate in @xcite in which the authors found @xmath108 so that @xmath109     while the continuous line corresponds to the critical part of the expected free energy @xmath100 versus @xmath60 . ]",
    "further theoretical as well as experimental determinations of @xmath104 can be found in @xcite : the deviation @xmath110 of our prediction ( [ predi ] ) from observations appears to be less than 7% in all the more recent values .",
    "the following figure fig.([fig - cp ] ) in which we draw both the graph of the ( non - analytic part of the ) regge free energy and of @xmath111 confirm that in the parts of the graph of @xmath100 in which the dependence on @xmath104 is important the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "the first obvious improvement is to keep all the regge exponents @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 without fixing _ a priori _ any of them ( while here , for the sake of simplicity , we set both @xmath116 and @xmath114 to @xmath117 , the 2d ising values ) . as it has been already stressed , it is also natural to explore different patterns of duality breakings . one can keep in the parameters space the parameter @xmath38 without fixing it to 1 ( the 2d ising value ) . in the ansatz ( [ parto32 ] ) the terms corresponding to the 2d ising model ( [ t2d ] ) ( which , in the kallen - lehman view comes from the single particles discrete part of the spectrum @xcite ) has a natural interpretation as a `` boundary terms '' . in other words ,",
    "the 2d - like term with a single integral has its origin in the boundary contributions in the same way as in the 2d case , the trivial one - dimensional term has its origin in the boundary .",
    "it is conceivable that the patterns of duality breakings in the bulk and at the boundary could be different .",

    "we expect that more general duality breakings could improve of two or three order of magnitude the ( already quite good ) agreement at low temperatures . as a matter of fact , all these natural ways to improve the numerical results ( which add at least two parameters to the computations ) would need a big cluster of cpus since without a cluster the cpu s time needed would be too long .",
