    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although the three observations show that the source is in the same class of variability , the energy dependence of the qpo amplitude is quite different from one observation to the other .",
    "the main difference is the presence of a turn - over in the amplitude vs. energy relation in obs .",
    "2 which is not obvious in the other ones ( although a flattening is always detected ) . obviously , this is not related to the frequency of the feature : e.g. the 2 features observed in obs .",
    "4 have a similar energy dependence of their amplitude , although they have different frequencies .",
    "we found that the radio loud hard state ( a.k.a . class @xmath0-@xmath1 )",
    "does not lead to sensible parameters when fitted with a multi colour disc black body and a power - law ( see muno et al .",
    "2001 , trudolyubov 2001 ) .",
    "a broken power - law represents the 3 - 300 kev spectra well .",
    "+ during the 3 steady observations high level of radio emission is observed ( see fuchs et al .",
    "2003 , hannikainen et al .",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "the hard x - rays above 20 kev may originate from the jet ( as expected see markoff et al .",
    "2003 ; corbel et al .",
    "the spectra of grs 1915 + 105 , would then fit better in the standard picture of micro - quasars states .",
    "+ our analysis of the spectra of lfqpos confirms the presence of a cut - off in their energy dependence ( tomsick & kaaret 2001 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "2002 ) , with an evolving energy from @xmath215 - 20 kev in obs . 2 to a value @xmath325 kev in the remaining obs .",
    "( fig.[fig : amplitude ] ) . although the qpo cut - off is needed at some point ( otherwise its amplitude would grow indefinitely ) , its evolution is unclear .",
    "it can be easily understood , however , if the jet contributes significantly to the hard x - ray , and its flux is not modulated on such a short time scale . + the fact that a high level of radio emission ( at 15 ghz ) is found during obs.2 , when the cut - off is clearly detected in the qpo spectrum , is compatible with this interpretation .",
    "we thus propose that a part of the hard x - ray is emitted by the compact jet , explaining both the spectral behaviour of the source and the qpo `` spectra '' .",
