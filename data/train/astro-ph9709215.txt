    "the optical and uv emission of radio - quiet active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is dominated by a quasi - thermal component , the  big blue bump \" ( shields 1978 , malkan & sargent 1982 , malkan 1983 ) . the big blue bump is usually interpreted as thermal emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick , accretion disk around a massive black hole ( malkan 1983 , sun & malkan 1989 , laor & netzer 1989 : ln89 ) .",
    "there are two general reasons for this belief .",
    "first , if the accreting gas has any angular momentum far from the black hole , it will collapse to a disk as it falls into the gravitational potential of the hole .",
    "second , the effective temperature of radiation from optically thick gas accreting onto a @xmath6 solar mass black hole at the eddington accretion rate is roughly @xmath7  k. black body emission at @xmath8  k peaks in the optical and uv bands .",
    "unfortunately , theoretical models of accretion disk spectra do not agree with the observed optical - uv spectra of agns .",
    "a benchmark calculation of the vertical structure and optical - uv spectrum of an accretion disk around a massive black hole was performed by ln89 ( see also laor , netzer & piran 1990 and laor 1990 ) .",
    "they calculated the radial structure of the disk for three different viscosity prescriptions and computed the corresponding emergent spectra with a semi - analytic approximation to the radiative transfer equation .",
    "the predicted slope of the near uv spectrum ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ) was larger than the mean near uv spectral index for a sample of @xmath11 agns ( @xmath12 , laor 1990 ) .",
    "ln89 also predicted that lyman edge features , both in absorption and emission , should generally be present in accretion disk spectra .",
    "however , lyman edge features have only been detected in a few agns ( antonucci , kinney & ford 1989 , koratkar , kinney & bohlin 1992 ) .",
    "since the work of ln89 , the sophistication of numerical models of agn accretion disks has increased dramatically , without a corresponding improvement in fits to the observed uv spectra .",
    "these models can be broadly divided into two groups : those which compute the uv spectrum using the diffusion approximation ( ross , fabian & mineshige 1992 , shimura & takahara 1993 , drrer , 1996 ) and those which explicitly solve the radiative transfer equations ( hubeny & hubeny 1997 , blaes & agol 1996 , storzer , hauschildt & allard 1994 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a calculation of the uv spectra of accretion disks around massive non - rotating black holes using the method developed by sincell & krolik ( 1997 ) .",
    "we solve the frequency- and angle - dependent radiative transfer equation with a variable eddington factor method ( auer & mihalas 1970 ) .",
    "we assume lte level populations and neglect comptonization .",
    "the gas temperature is determined by balancing viscous and radiative heating with radiative cooling and the density is determined by hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the local disk spectra are then added together , including doppler boosting by the rotation of the disk and the redshift caused by propagation out of the potential well of the black hole , to form the observed integrated disk spectrum .",
    "the emergent flux from one face of a geometrically thin keplerian disk around a black hole is @xmath13 independent of the viscosity .",
    "the relativistic correction factors @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are taken from the standard references ( novikov & thorne 1973 , page & thorne 1974 ) , and apply to accretion disks around non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black holes .",
    "the surface density required to support a given accretion rate is determined by relating the vertically - averaged @xmath17-@xmath18 component of the stress tensor to local physical conditions .",
    "the conventional _ ansatz _ for doing this is the ",
    "@xmath19\"-model introduced by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , in which this component of the stress is taken to be a dimensionless number @xmath20 times the vertically - averaged pressure . however , as shakura & sunyaev ( 1976 ) showed , this model is thermally unstable when , as commonly occurs , the disk pressure is dominated by radiation .    in the absence of a compelling physical argument for any particular viscosity prescription , we follow ln89 and investigate three different stress prescriptions .",
    "we calculate the disk surface mass density assuming that the stress tensor is proportional to the total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure , the gas pressure and the geometric mean of the radiation and gas pressures .",
    "the second and third models are thermally stable .",
    "we choose @xmath21 , but the results depend only very weakly on the value of this number .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the ( half ) surface mass density at a given radius @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the schwarzschild radius , is @xmath24 for @xmath25 ( the @xmath26 case ) , @xmath27 for @xmath28 ( the @xmath29 case ) and @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( the @xmath32 case ) . in these expressions",
    "we introduce @xmath1 , the accretion rate in units of the eddington critical accretion rate assuming the schwarzschild efficiency of 0.057 , and @xmath2 , the mass of the central black hole in units of @xmath6 solar masses ( sk97 ) .",
    "the relativistic correction factors are taken from novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) and riffert & herold ( 1995 ) .    to find the local heating rate per unit mass , we assume that at any given radius the heating rate is independent of position .",
    "it is then @xmath33 where the factor of two reflects the fact that @xmath34 is the total surface mass density of the disk and we are calculating the flux from only one face of the disk .    we determine the vertical structure and uv spectrum of the disk by solving the coupled differential equations describing the transfer of radiation , hydrostatic equilibrium , and the relation between optical depth and the vertical coordinate , subject to the local constraints of thermal equilibrium and charge conservation .",
    "we include electron scattering , bremsstrahlung and hi , hei and heii photoionization opacities and the corresponding continuum cooling processes .",
    "we neglect all line opacities and emissivities .",
    "a detailed description of the computational method is presented in sk97 .    in order to calculate the spectrum of a conventional disk , we have made two changes to the method described in sk97 .",
    "first , the local heating rate is determined by viscous heating ( eq . [ eq : local heating rate ] ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we neglect irradiation of the disk .",
    "second , the boundary conditions on the radiation flux and the gas pressure have been changed .",
    "the gas pressure at the upper edge of the disk is set to a small fraction of the total central pressure .",
    "the radiation flux is set to zero at the disk midplane .",
    "the analytic solution used by ln89 for the gas density ( their equations 13 , along with their assumption of constant density as a function of altitude ) and temperature ( as expressed in their equation 25 ) is in good agreement with our calculation because electron scattering dominates the flux weighted mean opacity .",
    "a typical example of the results of a vertical structure calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tp profile ] .",
    "the dashed lines are the gas density and temperature profiles used by ln89 .",
    "the gas density is constant near the midplane of the disk , as expected for a radiation pressure dominated disk , but drops rapidly above @xmath35 .",
    "the ln89 estimate of the gas density at the midplane is about a factor of two smaller than the actual central density and about an order of magnitude larger than the density at @xmath36 .",
    "the discrepancy at the midplane is due to the riffert & herrold ( 1995 ) corrections to the expression for the vertical gravity in the relativistic portion of a thin disk , which were not included in ln89 .",
    "the numerical value for the midplane density agrees with the ln89 value to within a few percent when we use the same expression for the vertical gravity as they used .",
    "the gas temperature estimate of ln89 is a good approximation to the true profile at large optical depths , but the more accurate treatment gives temperatures which are about @xmath37 higher near the top of the disk .      despite the close agreement between the gas pressure and temperature profiles , our predicted spectrum is quite different from the one found by ln89 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is that the ln89 calculation of the emergent spectrum is accurate only if electron scattering dominates the opacity at _ all _ frequencies .",
    "they define the mass column @xmath38 of the uv photosphere at @xmath39 by setting the effective optical depth of the photosphere @xmath40 when @xmath41 , this expression gives the erroneous result that @xmath42 , rather than the correct optical depth , @xmath43 . as a result ,",
    "this prescription overestimates @xmath38 by a factor @xmath44 .",
    "because the temperature increases with increasing @xmath45 , this method overestimates the photospheric temperature , and the observed flux at @xmath39 , when @xmath41 .",
    "we find that the absorptive opacity dominates several significant frequency ranges  well below the lyman edge ( where free - free opacity is important ) and just above the heii edge ( heii photoionization opacity ) , even though electron scattering dominates the flux - weighted opacity .",
    "therefore , the largest differences between our calculation and ln89 occur in these frequency ranges .",
    "our improvements in the radiative transfer calculation result in three changes to the predicted spectrum of an accretion disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : laor comparison ] ) .",
    "first , we find that the slope of the non - ionizing continuum is much harder than predicted by ln89 .",
    "the free - free opacity @xmath46 well below the lyman edge , so the mass column of the photosphere increases with frequency ( @xmath47 , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "this results in a rapid increase in the flux density with frequency because radiation from higher frequencies comes from hotter gas .",
    "in contrast , the ln89 prescription results in a nearly constant @xmath48 in this frequency range and a much weaker frequency dependence for the flux .",
    "second , the amplitudes of the spectral features are underestimated by the ln89 model .",
    "the opacity jump across the lyman edge is large in both models but , for the reasons outlined above , ln89 underestimate the corresponding change in photospheric temperature because @xmath41 .",
    "third , the continuum flux above the heii edge is overestimated by ln89 .",
    "the heii photoionization opacity is much larger than @xmath49 at @xmath50 , where most of the high frequency flux is formed , which causes the ln89 approach to overestimate the photospheric temperature .",
    "the surface mass density of the disk is smallest for the @xmath26 case and largest for the @xmath32 case ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : sigma pt ] - [ eq : sigma pg ] ) .",
    "although the difference in @xmath34 can be many orders of magnitude , we find that the spectral changes are comparatively small ( fig . [ fig : standard visc ] ) .",
    "the gas density increases with @xmath45 , so the bound - free opacity of the @xmath26 case is much smaller than either the @xmath51 or @xmath32 cases .",
    "compared to the other cases , the flux above the heii edge is about a factor of ten larger in the @xmath26 case , with a corresponding decrease of a factor of two in flux below the lyman edge .",
    "the flux between these frequencies is nearly the same in all three cases .",
    "the shift of flux from low to high frequencies results in smaller edge features for the @xmath26 case .    in figures [ fig : standard mass ] and [ fig : standard mdot ]",
    "we plot the spectra of the standard accretion disk as a function of @xmath2 for fixed @xmath1 and as a function of @xmath1 for fixed @xmath2 , respectively . in order to illustrate the effects of variations in these parameters",
    ", we fix the viscosity prescription and use the thermally stable @xmath29 case .",
    "although there is continuous curvature to the spectra , they can be characterized by three parameters : the near ( @xmath52 ) and far ( @xmath53 ) uv spectral indices and the amplitude of the lyman edge feature ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "we define the spectral indices as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath52 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath53 .",
    "the amplitude of the lyman edge feature is defined as the ratio of the fluxes just above and below the edge .",
    "this quantity is less than one for absorption edges and larger than one for emission edges .",
    "the shape of the spectrum depends primarily on the ratio of the accretion rate to the central mass , @xmath60 ( see table [ table : spectral parameters ] ) .",
    "this quantity determines the effective temperature scale of the disk because @xmath61 .",
    "we find that the near uv spectral index hardens from @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 to @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "for the same range of @xmath60 , the far uv spectral index increases from @xmath68 ( no flux above the lyman edge ) to @xmath69 and the amplitude of the lyman edge increases from @xmath70 ( no flux above the lyman edge ) to @xmath71 .",
    "the near uv spectral index is also weakly dependent on the disk luminosity ( @xmath72 ) so that the spectrum softens slightly with increasing disk luminosity .",
    "no appreciable emission is seen above the heii edge in any of the disks . only in the hottest case ( @xmath73 )",
    "is any emission seen at those frequencies .",
    "although the near uv spectral index of the hotter disks is near the canonical @xmath74 power law , appropriate for a newtonian disk ( pringle 1981 ) , this is a coincidence caused by two competing effects . on the one hand , we find that the near - uv spectrum of an individual ring is significantly harder than a black body at its effective temperature . on the other hand ( as pointed out by ln89 ) ,",
    "the general relativistic corrections to the disk structure equations soften the disk - integrated spectrum by making the dependence of temperature on radius shallower .      the computed gas temperature and pressure profiles also allow us to make an _ a posteriori _ check of our model assumptions : lte level populations and no comptonization .",
    "comptonization will change the observed disk spectrum if the compton opacity is larger than the absorptive opacity and the compton y - parameter , defined as @xmath75 ( rybicki and lightman 1979 ) , is greater than unity . in the present context , the relevant compton optical depth is the optical depth from the photosphere to the disk surface , so @xmath76 . for most frequencies @xmath77 . in the spectral range where free - free opacity is the dominant absorption mechanism , yet @xmath78 , we define @xmath79 by @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the scale height for changes is the gas density near the photosphere in @xmath83  cm and @xmath84 is the disk temperature in @xmath8  k.    for our range of central masses and accretion rates , the height of the radiation pressure supported disk is @xmath85  cm . at @xmath86",
    "gm/@xmath87 gas pressure gradients support the disk against gravity and we find that the scale height is typically @xmath88 times the thickness of the disk .",
    "the photosphere lies in the gas pressure supported layer of the disk for virtually all frequencies in all our models , implying that @xmath89 .",
    "the photospheric temperature is @xmath90  k , and we conclude that @xmath91 for all our models . including bound - free opacity in this estimate would further reduce @xmath79 .",
    "note , however , the very sharp dependence of @xmath92 on temperature .",
    "smaller central masses , which lead to higher temperatures , can create circumstances in which comptonization is significant ( e.g. as in the work of ross 1992 ) .",
    "departures from lte level populations become significant when the gas pressure in the disk is @xmath93  dyn  @xmath94 ( storzer , 1994 ) .",
    "when the gas pressure is this low , non - lte effects can reduce the amplitude of the lyman edge or drive it into emission .",
    "however , we expect lte to be a good approximation in our case because @xmath95  dyn  @xmath94 near the photospheres of our models . to check this assumption , we have made a non - lte calculation of the disk spectrum for the case @xmath96 and @xmath97 . as expected , we find that non - lte effects have a negligible effect upon the spectrum .",
    "we have calculated the vertical structure and uv spectrum of a conventional , viscously heated , accretion disk around a massive non - rotating black hole .",
    "electron scattering dominates the opacity and the disk is supported by radiation pressure , except in the uppermost layers , where the gravitational acceleration becomes large and gas pressure gradients support the disk .",
    "the computed midplane density and temperature agree with the predictions of analytic calculations of the vertical structure ( ln89 , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , if the riffert & herrold ( 1995 ) corrections to the vertical gravity are included .",
    "although the flux weighted mean opacity is dominated by electron scattering , the absorptive opacity can exceed the thomson opacity both below the lyman edge and above the heii edge .",
    "in contrast , the best previous calculation ( ln89 ) assumed that electron scattering dominates the opacity at all frequencies , leading them to overestimate the flux in these frequency ranges .",
    "as a consequence of our improved treatment of the gas opacity and radiative transfer , we find greater overall spectral curvature and larger features at the lyman edge and the heii edge .",
    "although the spectral index of the near uv spectrum of the hotter disks is near the newtonian black body value ( @xmath74 ) , this is just a coincidence .",
    "we find that the local black body approximation is not a good description of the disk spectrum .",
    "we computed spectra assuming that the viscous stress was proportional to the total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure , the gas pressure and the geometric mean of the two pressures .",
    "we find that the lower densities in the @xmath26 case cause the flux above the heii edge to increase by about an order of magnitude and the flux below the lyman edge to decrease by about a factor of two .",
    "this results in somewhat smaller edge amplitudes in this case .",
    "the flux between these two energies is unaffected by the viscosity prescription .",
    "the shape of the uv spectrum is determined by the effective temperature of the disk radiation or , equivalently , @xmath98 . for the hottest disks , the near uv spectral index , @xmath65 and the far uv index , @xmath99 .",
    "the lyman edge can be in emission for these disks .",
    "the coldest disks have softer near uv spectra ( @xmath100 ) and are completely absorbed above the lyman edge .",
    "the average optical - uv power - law index for quasars is @xmath101 ( laor 1990 ) but a single power law is a poor description of the continuum spectrum ( francis , 1991 ) .",
    "the continuum of the composite quasar spectrum , formed by combining all the quasars in the large bright quasar survey , softens with increasing frequency ( francis , 1991 ) . both the mean optical - uv slope and the spectral curvature are consistent with our predicted uv spectrum of an irradiated disk if @xmath102 .",
    "however , disks this cold would be completely absorbed above the lyman edge , which is not observed ( antonucci , kinney & ford 1989 ; koratkar , kinney & bohlin 1992 ) . on the other hand , disks hot enough to eliminate the lyman edge feature all have @xmath52 much larger than the observed slope .",
    "observational support for the existence of accretion disks in agn originally came from the qualitative match between the  big blue bump \" and the characteristic temperature scale predicted by the thermal accretion disk model .",
    "we now see that the simplest theoretical models fail when confronted with more specific spectral tests . the model considered here , in which the dissipation all occurs inside a geometrically thin , but optically very thick , disk around a non - rotating black hole does not adequately explain the observed uv spectrum .",
    "the next step in this program is to study the consequences of placing accretion disks around rotating ( kerr ) black holes .",
    "laor ( 1992 ) argued that the large doppler shifts and gravitational redshifts of disk radiation from near the last stable orbit of a kerr black hole could spread the lyman edge feature and make it undetectable , but did not present detailed calculations of these effects .",
    "in addition , the effective temperature distribution for a disk around a kerr black hole is different from that for a disk around a schwarzschild hole , and this , too , may affect the shape of the uv continuum .",
    "we plan to construct models for the structure and uv continuum emission from disks around kerr black holes in the near future .",
    "we would like to thank ari laor for helpful conversations and for providing many disk spectra .",
    "we also thank omer blaes and eric agol for ongoing conversations .",
