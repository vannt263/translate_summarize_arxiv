    "the understanding of the behavior of a spin glass in a magnetic field is a challenging issue from both experimental and theoretical sides .    in the theoretical side , there are two competing theories . in the droplet model",
    "the spin glass phase is unstable ( for any amount of magnetic field ) and so there is no phase transition : there is only a pure state describing all the ising spin glass in a magnetic field .@xcite on the other side , mean field ( mf ) predicts a phase transition between two phases .",
    "the first one is characterized by one pure state , and the low temperature phase is described by a countable number of pure states . in the mean field approximation a third order phase transition @xcite has been found between those two phases @xcite separated by the de almedia - thouless line .@xcite see references for a description and for a critic of the rsb picture .",
    "hence , those two competing theories have opposite predictions about the overall behavior of a spin glass in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , to perform experimental or numerical tests of the previous analytical predictions has proved very difficult despite the clear theoretical predictions ( phase transition or not ! ) .",
    "a further step in mean field computations is to take into account the effect of fluctuations .",
    "this can be done , for instance , using field theoretic methods and has been done in the past .",
    "working with a projected theory ( by taking only the replicon sector which contains the most divergent terms of the initial hamiltonian ) no fixed points have been found in the model.@xcite it is important to mention that the existence or not of a transition in magnetic field affects the existence or not of a phase with replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) at zero magnetic field .",
    "in particular the absence of a fixed point for the ising spin glass in a magnetic field supports the droplet picture against the mean field one .",
    "a recent and detailed analysis @xcite reaches the same conclusions of ref .",
    ", and so three possibilities are opened : _",
    "no phase transition at all , _ ii _ ) first order phase transition driven by fluctuations and finally _ iii _ ) second order phase transition dominated by a fixed point outside the accessible perturbative region ( i.e. region of small parameters ) .",
    "however , a fourth possibility has been recently opened by temesvri and de dominicis,@xcite who have extended the field theoretic analysis further .",
    "they analyze a field theory in which the replicon and anomalous sectors are both _ critical _ going beyond the old analysis where only the replicon sector was taken critical .",
    "the main result of this analysis is the existence of a new critical point ( which appears at eight dimensions ) taking the control of the phase transition at six dimensions .",
    "the authors also pointed out that this new fixed point provides a phase transition which has different features to that of mean field .    on the numerical side",
    "the situation is a bit clearer ( but not enough ! ) .",
    "looking at the off equilibrium numerical simulations , the difference between the mean overlap and the minimum overlap has been computed.@xcite in four dimensions and not for too low temperatures there is a clear difference between these two measurements , which is a clear signature for replica symmetry breaking .",
    "another off equilibrium approach is to compute the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem out of equilibrium .",
    "this has been done using a slightly modified version of the four dimensional gaussian spin glass,@xcite and it was found that the violation is well understood in terms of a non trivial low temperature phase . in this paper we will follow this approach but working in three dimensions and simulating the edwards - anderson model . it is important to notice , that the same kind of studies on the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation out of equilibrium can be done in real experiments .",
    "in fact , in a recent paper , @xcite the violation of the fluctuation - dissipation relations in an ising spin glass ( in zero magnetic field ) has been reported , and the experiment can be explained in terms of replica symmetry breaking .    another numerical method is to use exact ground state techniques in order to understand the qualitative features of the low temperature phase .",
    "this has been done in three dimensions and a rsb behavior has been found between zero and a magnetic threshold ( for the gaussian ising spin glass in @xmath0 , this threshold is near 0.65 ) , however this work can not exclude completely a droplet behavior .",
    "@xcite a recent study @xcite points out that there is no phase transition at all ( at finite temperature ) but they can not exclude a critical field below 0.4",
    ".    we can cite different numerical studies working at equilibrium .",
    "those studies have been mainly done in four dimensions in order to avoid the proximity to the lower critical dimension ( which is between two and three , at least in the ising spin glass without magnetic field ) .",
    "those studies are not fully conclusive , but the existence of a finite temperature phase transition emerge as the most likely explanation of the numerical data.@xcite    on the experimental side the situation is not clear .",
    "there is strong experimental evidence about an irreversibility line ( where the zero field cooled ( zfc ) and the field cooled ( fc ) magnetization start to be different ) , but unfortunately , that line depends on the time , and so , we have only off equilibrium information about what happens in the presence of a magnetic field . in the literature , one can find some attempts to analyze the scaling behavior of the freezing temperatures and the conclusion is that no phase transition exists.@xcite    however , recent experimental studies based in the fluctuation - dissipation relations point out the existence of a phase transition in the presence of magnetic field.@xcite moreover , a phase transition has been reported in a heisenberg spin glass ( aufe ) in three dimensions in the presence of a magnetic field against the droplet prediction ( we recall that the droplet model predicts no phase transition independently of the number of components of the spin).@xcite    we will study the three dimensional ising spin glass using an off - equilibrium approach based on the computation of the fluctuation - dissipation relations .",
    "this method has provided and important tool to investigate the low temperature properties of disordered systems ( and it has been very useful in the study of non disordered systems such as glasses).@xcite",
    "we have focused this paper on the study of the fluctuation dissipation relations in the off - equilibrium regime . to do this",
    "we need to define the spin - spin autocorrelation function and the response of the magnetization to a small change of the magnetic field of the system .    in order to make the paper self - contained and to fix the notation",

    "it is clear that these two waiting times are asymptotic ( within error bars ) and so we are again confident in that our curves plotted in figure [ all_t ] are asymptotic .",
    "we have deleted the temperature factor in the ordinate axis and so each fdt straight line has slope @xmath147 .",
    "we can see that when the data leave the pseudo - equilibrium region ( i.e. the straight line ) , they go to the same curve ( independently of their temperatures ) .",
    "this is a strong signature that the pat ansatz works .",
    "we have tried in figure [ all_t_scaling ] this kind of ansatz and the scaling is very good and so we are confident that the pat scaling describes with great accuracy the behavior of the fluctuation dissipation curves in a large temperature window .",
    "notice that the pat scaling works for our @xmath151 and @xmath152independent curves .",
    "we have found a good scaling for values of @xmath153 . in figure [ all_t_scaling ]",
    "we use central value for @xmath154 .",
    "two clear and distinctive regimes can be seen in that figure .",
    "the first one correspond to the quasi - equilibrium regime : in that part of the figure the behavior is linear and so it matches with the quasi - equilibrium regime @xmath155 .",
    "the second one corresponds to the aging regime : that part of the plot can be parametrized with a power law with the @xmath156 exponent introduced above in the paper .",
    "we have obtained @xmath157 which provides @xmath158 , which is a compatible value with the @xmath159 value used in the scaling plot ( this is a check of consistency of the scaling law ! ) . for completeness",
    "we report the value of @xmath160 ( we remark that the aging region follows a law @xmath80 , where @xmath79 is the scaling variable @xmath161 ) : @xmath162 .",
    "we can compare the values obtained for @xmath160 and @xmath156 with previous results published in the literature . in the @xmath0 ising spin glass with no magnetic field @xmath163 and @xmath164.@xcite for the @xmath165 ising spin glass again with no magnetic field @xmath166 and @xmath164 .",
    "@xcite    we can see that in absence of magnetic field the @xmath156 value is close to the mean field value ( 0.5 ) whereas the magnetic field value in three dimensions is clearly far from the mf value .",
    "following reference this kind of scaling it is not enough to detect a rsb phase ( they found in the two dimensional ising model with no phase transition at finite temperature a pat scaling for their ofdr ) . nevertheless , in @xcite the pat scaling only works for points with the same waiting time , instead , in our plot we have points computed with different waiting times . in effect , we remark again , our scaling is @xmath37-independent ( at least in our numerical precision ) which is a behavior completely different from the two dimensional spin glass ( paramagnetic phase ) . for a paramagnetic phase and",
    "very long waiting time ( i.e. all the points lie in the @xmath59 straight line , see for example our figure [ high_t ] , we have equilibrated the system ) the pat scaling plot should consist in points over the linear part ( quasi - equilibrium regime ) , and no one in the power law part ( aging regime ) .",
    "we finally remark that this scaling in addition with the analysis of the ofdr ( see above ) provides us with a picture that could be explained assuming a low temperature phase with rsb .",
    "we have studied how the fluctuation dissipation relations work off equilibrium in the three dimensional ising spin glass with a magnetic field .",
    "we have shown numerical data that has been obtained simulating very large lattices ( @xmath167 and @xmath168 ) and for extremely large times for the three dimensional ising spin glass . in order to achieve these lattice sizes and time",
    "we have used a dedicated machine ( sue ) .",
    "we have identified with this tool a paramagnetic phase in the high temperature region ( as expected ) and a phase where we have found strong violations of fluctuation - dissipation .",
    "we can describe very well ( within our statistical precision ) these violations assuming a rsb scenario , yet we can not exclude completely a droplet scenario .",
    "moreover we have shown the crossover , both moving in temperature as well as moving in magnetic field , between a spin glass behavior and a paramagnetic one .",
    "we have a picture of the phase diagram composed by three points ( using the notation @xmath137 ) : @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( with the symbol @xmath172 we denote that the figure that follows is only indicative ) .",
    "in addition we know that for the gaussian model there is a critical point at @xmath173 , but this critical magnetic field should be modified to take into account that we are using binary couplings .",
    "finally we have checked that the overlap probability distribution of our model , @xmath50 , ( obtained via the static - dynamics link : @xmath174 ) , which is not trivial ( at least within our numerical precision , see section ii . ) , satisfies the pat ansatz .",
