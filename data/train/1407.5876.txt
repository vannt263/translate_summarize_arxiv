    "because they are such natural and beautiful structures , lattices and crystals appear throughout physics and mathematics , in many different ( and often unexpected ) ways @xcite . here",
    "we introduce the idea of a choreographic crystal , a type of configuration that can be much more symmetrical than is revealed by a snapshot of it at any given time .",
    "we study this idea from several different angles , and suggest experimental diffraction signatures to identify and characterize such choreographic systems in the lab , whether they are naturally occuring or artificially engineered .",
    "let us start with a simple and beautiful example of a choreographic lattice .",
    "we can find our way to this example by comparing the following two elementary problems .",
    "the first problem is static : what is the most symmetrical arrangement of four points on the 2-sphere ?",
    "the solution is well known : the four points are the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron .",
    "we can express the positions of these four points neatly in cartesian coordinates as follows : we start from the 8 vertices of the cube @xmath0 and select the four vertices with an even number of minus signs ; in other words , the positions @xmath1 of the four points ( @xmath2 ) have cartesian components @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "the second problem is a natural dynamical analogue of the first : let us now imagine that we let the points flow along the geodesics of the sphere ( _ i.e _  the great circles ) , with angular velocities that are constant in time and all have equal magnitudes , like satellites in circular orbit around the sun  what is the most symmetrical configuration of four such satellite trajectories ?",
    "once again , the answer may be neatly summarized in cartesian coordinates : we choose the four satellites to have trajectories @xmath7 with cartesian components @xmath8 given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is given by eq .",
    "( [ q_hat ] ) .",
    "this solution has the following geometrical interpretation .",
    "each of the four satellites is orbiting in a different orbital plane : the @xmath11th trajectory @xmath7 is a circular orbit with its angular momentum in the direction @xmath1 ; in other words , there is one satellite orbiting around each of the four 3-fold symmetry axes of the regular tetrahedron .",
    "furthermore , to achieve maximal symmetry , the relative phases of the four orbits ( or , equivalently , the initial positions ) have been carefully chosen : for example , note that whenever the four satellites degenerate into a common plane [ which happens 6 times per orbit , whenever @xmath12 , for odd @xmath13 , they always form a perfect square containing the origin at its center .",
    "since the first problem is static , the corresponding solution ( [ q_hat ] ) has a static sort of symmetry : a group ( the full tetrahedral group ) of 24 spatial rotations and reflections that carry the configuration into itself .",
    "since the second problem is dynamical , the corresponding solution ( [ p_hat ] ) has a dynamic sort of symmetry . from a static standpoint , a",
    " still photograph \" of ( [ p_hat ] ) at some instant will , at most , be symmetric under 16 rotations and reflections ( namely , the symmetry group @xmath14 of the square prism , at the special times @xmath15 described above ) ; but , from a dynamic standpoint , we can recall that the satellites four angular momenta point along the four diagonals of the cube with vertices @xmath0 , and note that any rotation or reflection that leaves this cube invariant ( there are 48 in total ) also leaves the 4-satellite orbit ( [ p_hat ] ) invariant , _ when combined with an appropriate overall translation and/or reflection in time_. in both solutions , ( [ q_hat ] ) and ( [ p_hat ] ) , the four particles are equivalent to one another , in the sense that any particle may be mapped into any other by one or more of the symmetries .",
    "while the symmetries of ( [ q_hat ] ) are intuitively clear , the symmetries of ( [ p_hat ] ) are considerably more subtle  yet , as we have seen , ( [ p_hat ] ) is actually more symmetrical than ( [ q_hat ] ) !",
    "just as ( [ q_hat ] ) represents one of the simplest examples of a static lattice on the sphere , ( [ p_hat ] ) represents one of the simplest examples of a choreographic lattice on the sphere .",
    "solution ( [ q_hat ] ) was known in ancient times ; but , as far as we can tell , ( [ p_hat ] ) is new .",
    "we believe that choreographic crystals share a beauty and naturalness with ordinary crystals , and we hope that they may be of similarly broad interest and importance .",
    "in the previous section , we introduced choreographic crystals via an example based on a symmetrical configuration of four satellite orbits . in this section , we explain how to construct and classify _ all _ symmetrical satellite configurations .",
    "( for earlier work on symmetric satellite configurations , see @xcite . )",
    "in addition to being intrinsically ( and technologically ) interesting , this problem will set up our more general treatment of choreographic crystals in the subsequent section .",
    "let us start by establishing some notation , terminology and conventions . in this section",
    ", we can imagine for concreteness that each individual satellite moves on a keplerian ( elliptical ) orbit with unit period .",
    "the time translation operator @xmath16 maps each orbit @xmath17 to the orbit @xmath18 ( it shifts all of the satellites forward along their orbits by a common phase ) ; the time reversal operator @xmath19 maps each orbit @xmath17 to the orbit @xmath20 ( it reverses all velocities and angular velocities , so the satellites move backward along their orbits ) ; and an element @xmath21 of the orthogonal group @xmath22 maps each orbit @xmath17 to the ( rotated and/or reflected ) orbit @xmath23 .",
    "we can also combine these operations : _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "[ to illustrate , consider two combinations ",
    "( i ) a @xmath26 time delay combined with a @xmath27 rotation around the @xmath28 axis , or ( ii ) zero time delay combined with a reflection through the @xmath29 plane : either combination leaves a circular orbit in the @xmath29 plane invariant , but acts non - trivially on an orbit which is tipped out of the @xmath29 plane . ]",
    "we refer to a set of satellite orbits as a  swarm \" @xmath30 .",
    "a  symmetry \" ( or  symmetry operation \" @xcite ) of the swarm @xmath30 is a combined transformation @xmath31 that leaves @xmath30 invariant : @xmath32 ; and a  @xmath33symmetry \" of the swarm @xmath30 is a combined transformation @xmath34 that leaves @xmath30 invariant : @xmath35 . in other words ,",
    "a @xmath33symmetry involves time reversal , while a symmetry does not .",
    "[ for example , a swarm of circular orbits has a symmetry consisting of a time shift by half a period combined with spatial inversion through the origin ( @xmath36 ) ; and a single elliptical orbit has two @xmath33-symmetries : one which combines a time reversal with a rotation around the periapse direction , and another which combines a time reversal with a reflection in the plane spanned by the periapse and angular momentum directions .",

    "for example , the 4-satellite orbit described in the previous section is a primative @xmath37-@xmath33symmetric swarm , where @xmath58 is the achiral octahedral group ( _ i.e. _  the full symmetry group of the cube , including rotations and reflections ) ; the index-2 subgroup is @xmath59 ( the pyritotetrahedral group ) ; and the one - dimensional representation @xmath11 of @xmath39 is @xmath60 ( in mulliken notation ) .",
    "a primitive @xmath37-symmetric or @xmath37-@xmath33symmetric swarm is generated by acting on a fiducial satellite orbit @xmath43 with @xmath61 distinct operations ( where @xmath62 is the order of @xmath37 ) ; this process will generically produce a swarm with @xmath61 satellites .",
    "but if the fiducial orbit @xmath43 and representation @xmath11 are chosen carefully , then @xmath43 will be invariant under some subgroup @xmath63 of the these operations , and we will instead generate a primitive @xmath37-invariant swarm in which the number of satellites is only @xmath64 .",
    "such orbits , in which an especially small number of satellites manage to represent an especially large number of symmetries , are of special interest and importance : the natural figure of merit here is @xmath65 or , equivalently , the total number of symmetries @xmath62 divided by the total number of satellites in the @xmath37-invariant swarm @xmath30 .",

    "the symmetric satellite swarms in the previous section are a special case of a more general class of object with choreographic order .",
    "it is natural to generalize the previous section in two different ways .        _ choreographic crystals on various geometries . _ just as it is interesting to study static lattices , crystals and tilings on a wide variety of different spaces ( the 2-sphere , the 3-sphere , 2d euclidean space , 3d euclidean space ,  ) , it is interesting to study choreographic order on a wide variety of spaces .",

    "let us see the effect of this modified bragg law in two standard experimental configurations @xcite : von laue diffraction and powder diffraction .    _",
    "von laue diffraction and powder diffraction .",
    "_ in von laue diffraction , a beam of particles of mass @xmath103 ( with a range of energies , but a single fixed direction @xmath104 ) is scattered off a single crystal of fixed orientation .",
    "first focus on a particular diffraction peak due to sub - lattice @xmath98 ( corresponding to a particular point @xmath105 in its reciprocal lattice ) .",
    "if sub - lattice @xmath98 were at rest , this peak would lie in the direction @xmath106 , with wavenumber @xmath107 and frequency @xmath108 ; but when we give the sub - lattice a small velocity @xmath109 , the direction and frequency of the peak changes ( to first order in @xmath109 ) as follows : the perturbed peak still lies in the unperturbed scattering plane spanned by @xmath104 and @xmath106 , but the scattering angle @xmath110 shifts from its unperturbed value @xmath111 to the perturbed value @xmath112 , while the frequency shifts by @xmath113 .",
    "when we superpose the diffraction pattern from the @xmath95 different sub - lattices , we see that for the most part , the peaks from different sub - lattices do not overlap , but instead group into @xmath95-tuplets with small angular and frequency splittings described by the preceding formulae .",
    "but for certain values of @xmath105 , it can happen that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the same , for two different sub - lattices @xmath98 and @xmath116 : in this case , these two peaks will interfere with one another , with the interference phase @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are arbitrarily chosen points in sub - lattices @xmath98 and @xmath116 , at some arbitrary time @xmath81 . in powder diffraction",

    "otherwise , the story is the same as in the von laue case : the peaks group into @xmath95-tuplets , with small splittings given by the preceding formulae ; and interference when @xmath124 , with interference phase @xmath117 .",
    "the possible crystals in 2d and 3d euclidean space , and their corresponding diffraction patterns , will be explored further in subsequent work @xcite . in the future",
    ", it will be interesting to reconsider the vibrational modes of an ordinary crystal , by thinking of them as a special type of choreographic crystal ; or to explore the possible connections with previous work on generating higher harmonics of laser fields ( which also relies crucially on the combined space - time symmetries of the system in question ) @xcite ; or to consider the possibility of choreographic _ quasi_crystals .",
