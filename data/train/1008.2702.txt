    "in the standard model ( sm ) , @xmath0 violation occurs due to a single , irreducible phase appearing in the @xmath2 quark - flavor mixing matrix , called the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , which relates quark mass eigenstates to weak eigenstates .",
    "unitarity of the ckm matrix yields a set of relations among its elements that can be depicted as triangles in the complex plane .",
    "in particular , the unitarity condition @xmath3 gives rise to the so - called unitarity triangle ( ut ) , whose sides and angles are related to the magnitudes and phases of the ckm matrix elements @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "the main goal of the two @xmath1-factory experiments ",
    "belle @xcite at kek , japan and babar @xcite at slac , usa  is to overconstrain the ut through precise measurements of its sides and angles . by doing so",
    ", they are designed to verify whether the ckm mechanism is the correct description of @xmath0 violation in the sm , and to set constraints on possible new physics effects that could lead to inconsistencies among these measurements .    in these proceedings",
    ", we summarize recent results on @xmath0 violation , involving three ut angles , from belle and babar . after a decade of successful operation , during which many records are made and broken subsequently ,",
    "these two @xmath1-factory experiments have together collected over @xmath7 @xmath8 pairs at the @xmath9 peak .",
    "the kekb accelerator of the @xmath1 factory in japan holds the current world record with a peak luminosity @xmath10 .",
    "results reported here comprise the full @xmath9 data from babar ( @xmath11 @xmath8 ) and a large fraction of the @xmath9 data available with belle ( @xmath12 @xmath8 ) .",
    "the ut angles are mostly determined through the measurement of the time - dependent  asymmetry , @xmath13-n[b^0(t)\\to f_{\\cp } ] }                    { n[\\bbar^0(t)\\to f_{\\cp}]+n[b^0(t)\\to f_{\\cp } ] } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] is the number of @xmath15s that decay into a common  eigenstate @xmath16 after time @xmath17 .",
    "the asymmetry , in general , can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mass difference between the two @xmath20 mass eigenstates .",
    "( note that babar uses a notation @xmath21 . )",
    "the sine coefficient @xmath22 here is related to the ut angles , while the cosine coefficient @xmath23 is a measure of direct  violation . for the latter to have a nonzero value",
    ", one needs at least two competing amplitudes with different weak and strong phases to contribute to the decay final state . as an example , for the decay @xmath24 , where mostly one diagram contributes , the cosine term is expected to vanish and the sine term is proportional to the ut angle @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 corresponding to @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , respectively , is adopted by babar . ] .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry is , therefore , given as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath0 eigenvalue of the final state @xmath16 .",
    "in the case of @xmath1 factories , the measurement of @xmath32 utilizes decays of the  into two neutral @xmath1 mesons , of which one can be fully reconstructed into a  eigenstate , while decay products of the other ( called the tag @xmath1 ) identify its flavor at the decay time .",
    "the time difference @xmath17 between the two @xmath1 decays is determined by reconstructing their decay vertices .",
    "finally the @xmath0 asymmetry amplitudes , proportional to the ut angles , are obtained from a maximum likelihood fit to the proper time distributions separately for events tagged as @xmath33 and @xmath20 .",
    "the most precise measurement of the angle @xmath25 is obtained from a study of the decays @xmath34 charmonium @xmath35 .",
    "these decays , known as  golden \" modes , mainly proceed via the ckm - favored tree diagram @xmath36 with an internal @xmath37-boson emission . the subleading penguin ( loop )",
    "contribution to the final state , having a different weak phase compared to the tree diagram , is suppressed by almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "this makes @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] to a good approximation .",
    "besides the theoretical simplicity , these channels also offer experimental advantages because of the relatively large branching fractions ( @xmath39 ) and the presence of narrow resonances in the final state , which provides a powerful rejection against the combinatorial background .",
    "the  eigenstates considered for this analysis include @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "babar has updated the @xmath45 measurement with its full @xmath9 data sample @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath46 .",
    "combined with belle s result based on @xmath47 @xmath8 pairs @xcite , @xmath48 , the world - average value is @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the result , having a precision of @xmath50 , serves as a firm reference point for the sm .",
    "the world - average value of @xmath23 is @xmath51 @xcite , which is consistent with zero as expected .",
    "this major accomplishment of the @xmath1 factories has been cited @xcite as leading to half of the 2008 physics nobel prize being awarded to kobayashi and maskawa .",

    "+     the angle @xmath29 can not be extracted using time - dependent @xmath0 violation study in a similar fashion as was done for other two angles .",

    "both @xmath65 and @xmath66 decay to a common final state .",
    "this measurement can be performed in three different ways : ( a ) by utilizing decays of @xmath67 mesons to @xmath0 eigenstates , such as @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( @xmath0 even ) or @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( @xmath0 odd ) @xcite , ( b ) by making use of doubly cabibbo suppressed decays of @xmath67 mesons , _",

    "the first two methods are theoretically clean but suffer from low statistics . on the other hand , the dalitz method currently provides the strongest constraint on @xmath29 . combining all recent measurements from belle @xcite and babar @xcite ,",

    "as @xmath45 is the most precisely measured observable concerning @xmath0 violation in @xmath1 decays , one can use it as a `` standard candle '' to set constraints on new physics by looking for possible deviations from this value in a number of ways .",
    "one such is the comparison of the values of @xmath75 measured in penguin dominated decays with the world - average value of @xmath45 , coming from decays involving charmonium final states .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ penguin ] , where the largest discrepancy is found to be at the level of @xmath76 standard deviations . a caveat one should be aware of while making such",
    "a comparison is that the penguin modes may have additional topologies that could lead to a difference between @xmath45 and @xmath75 .",
    "if these sm corrections , @xmath77 , are well known then any residual difference @xmath78 would be from new physics . nevertheless , looking at fig .",
    "[ penguin ] it is fair to say that we need more data before drawing a firm conclusion whether the observed deviations are due to some new physics effects or a play of statistics .",
    "both belle and babar have intensively searched for direct @xmath0 violation in several @xmath1 decays .",
    "the most notable result comes from the decay @xmath79 , where direct @xmath0 violation has been established beyond any doubt : the measured @xmath0 asymmetry is @xmath80 .",
    "this is in contrast to the result from @xmath81 having a @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath82 .",
    "since both the decays are expected to proceed via similar feynman diagrams at the tree level , the discrepancy between the two measurements @xcite tells us that it could be either due to a large contribution from the color - suppressed tree diagram , or from possible new physics contribution in the electroweak penguin , or from a mixture of both . before concluding anything ,",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite to improve the precision on @xmath0 violation results of the decay @xmath83 @xcite using more data .",
    "in addition to these results , there are also a number of interesting evidences for direct @xmath0 violation at a level of @xmath84 standard deviations in the decays @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",

    "thanks to the excellent performance of the two @xmath1 factories , studies using a large sample of @xmath92 collision data at the @xmath9 peak have now established the ckm framework as the only source of @xmath0 violation in the sm .",
    "there are a number of intriguing hints , such as time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry in penguin dominated decays and direct @xmath0 asymmetry difference in @xmath93 , at various levels of significance .",
