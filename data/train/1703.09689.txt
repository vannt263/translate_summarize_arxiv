    "long - range interacting ( lri ) systems are those in which the two - body interparticle potential decays at large separation @xmath0 as v(r ) ~ ;  0 d , eq : vr where @xmath1 is the dimension of the embedding space , and @xmath2 is the coupling strength .",
    "the range of allowed values of the decay exponent @xmath3 implies that the energy per particle , @xmath4 , scales super - linearly with the system size .",
    "this feature is easily demonstrated by considering the example of a particle placed at the center of a hypersphere of radius @xmath5 in @xmath1 dimensions , with the other particles homogeneously distributed with a mass density @xmath6 .",
    "for such a system , considering the interaction potential ( [ eq : vr ] ) , the energy per particle is given as = _ ^r d^d r  = , eq : epsilon where @xmath7 is a short distance cut - off introduced to exclude the contribution to the energy due to particles located in a small neighborhood of radius @xmath8 , and is motivated by the need to regularize the divergence of the potential ( [ eq : vr ] ) at short distances . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) , @xmath9 denotes the angular volume in @xmath1 dimensions . from the equation",
    ", it follows that as @xmath5 is increased , the energy @xmath4 remains finite for @xmath10 , implying thereby the linear scaling of the total energy @xmath11 with the volume @xmath12 , thus making the system extensive .",
    "these systems are called short - range interacting systems . on the other hand , for our allowed values of @xmath3 ,",
    "the energy @xmath4 scales with the volume as @xmath13 ( the energy scales logarithmically with @xmath14 in the marginal case @xmath15 ) , thereby implying a super - linear scaling of the total energy of lri systems with @xmath14 , as @xmath16 .",
    "the lri systems are thus generically non - extensive . for such systems , on computing the free energy @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the intensive temperature and @xmath19 being the entropy that typically scales linearly with the volume , @xmath20 , we find due to the super - linear scaling of @xmath11 with @xmath14 that the thermodynamic properties are dominated by the energy",
    ". in particular , the equilibrium state of a mechanically isolated lri system at constant temperature , obtained by minimizing @xmath21 , corresponds to the one with the minimum energy , that is , the ground state , allowing for no thermal fluctuations .",
    "of course , in reality , there ought to be a competition between the energy and the entropy contributions to the free energy in order to have such phenomena as phase transitions that are known to occur in lri systems . a way out from this energy dominance consists in scaling the coupling constant as j , eq : j - scaling thereby making the energy extensive in the volume .",
    "note that this is just a  mathematical trick \" ( kac s trick ) to properly study lri systems within the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics that exists for short - range ones , and does not correspond to any physical effect .",
    "indeed , no interaction whose strength changes on varying the volume is known to occur . applying this trick",
    ", one can obtain the free energy per particle , and then revert to the actual physical description by scaling back the coupling constant . an equivalent alternative to kac s trick , which still allows for an effective competition between the energy and the entropy contribution to the free energy , consists in rescaling the temperature as t .",
    "eq : t - scaling    beyond the rescaling procedures discussed above , which were implemented to obtain a meaningful large - volume limit for lri systems and competing energy and entropy contributions to the free energy , let us illustrate how such a competition may actually occur in nature , by considering a relevant lri system in the arena of astrophysics , namely , that of globular clusters , see fig . [",
    "fig : globular ] . these clusters are gravitationally bound concentrations of @xmath22 stars that are spread over a volume that has a diameter ranging from several tens to about @xmath23 light years ( 1 light year = @xmath24 m ) . for a typical globular cluster ( m2 )",
    ", one has @xmath25 , @xmath26 light years , and total mass @xmath27 kg .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate of energy and entropy may be done as follows : e= ,  s = k_b n ~ ~1.7 10 ^ 60  k , eq : globular - clusters where @xmath28 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "to such an extremely high temperature as @xmath30 k , one can associate a velocity by invoking energy equipartition ( neglecting interactions ) , as @xmath31 km / s .",
    "typical star velocities indeed range between a few km / s to about @xmath32 km / s .",
    "thus , for systems such as these for which the temperature is high enough , the energy , although super - linear in volume ( @xmath33 ) , can effectively compete with the entropy contribution to the free energy .",
    "fig : globular    let us now make an important remark : although kac s trick allows to obtain an energy that is extensive in the volume , it is not necessarily additive ( additivity implies extensivity , but not the converse ) .",
    "a simple example will illustrate the point .",
    "consider the well - studied curie - weiss model of magnetism , with the hamiltonian given by h_cw=- _",
    "1 i < j n _ i _ j , eq : h - cw where @xmath34 are spin variables occupying the sites @xmath35 of a lattice .",
    "the model mimics a mean - field system ( every spin interacting with every other with the same strength ) , which may be considered as the @xmath36 limit of the potential ( [ eq : vr ] ) .",
    "being a mean - field system , one does not need to specify the structure of the underlying lattice , excepting to mention that every site is connected to every other . in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h - cw ] )",
    ", the coupling strength has been rescaled by using kac s trick , so that the energy is extensive in the number of spins given by @xmath37 .",
    "let us consider a macrostate with zero total magnetization : @xmath38 , which is composed of @xmath39 spin-@xmath40 sites and @xmath39 spin-@xmath41 sites , see fig .",
    "[ fig : additive ] . since the energy is proportional to the square of magnetization ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - cw ] ) ) , the total energy of the system is @xmath42 .",

    "this point will be demonstrated by considering several illustrative examples in the later parts of the paper . as a warm - up",
    ", we may mention that a violation of additivity implies a violation of convexity of the domain of accessible macrostates of an lri system , for example , a magnetic one in the magnetization ( @xmath47 ) - energy ( @xmath11 ) plane .",
    "an example of such a violation is shown in fig .",

    "for example , the states @xmath48 and @xmath49 in fig . [",
    "fig : convexity ] are not connected by any continuous energy - conserving dynamics .",
    "and @xmath49 are not connected by any continuous energy - conserving dynamics.,width=226 ]    fig : convexity    on account of the violation of additivity , one should exercise caution in discussing equilibrium properties of lri systems using the canonical ensemble whose derivation from the microcanonical ensemble relies on holding of additivity .",
    "let us briefly recall the derivation .",
    "the microcanonical partition function for a system of @xmath37 particles contained in a volume @xmath14 in @xmath50 dimensions is given by ( e , v , n ) ^3n q d^3n p  ( e - h(p , q ) ) , eq : microcanonical where @xmath51 are the canonically conjugate variables , and @xmath52 is the hamiltonian .",

    "the additivity of energy implies that one has @xmath59 , so that the probability distribution @xmath60 that the `` small '' system has energy @xmath53 is given by p(e_1 ) _ 2(e - e_1,v - v_1,n - n_1 ) .",

    "<S> , we discuss the general features of long - range interactions , emphasizing in particular the main physical phenomenon of non - additivity , which leads to a plethora of distinct effects , both thermodynamic and dynamic , that are not observed with short - range interactions : ensemble inequivalence , slow relaxation , broken ergodicity . in section 2 , we discuss several physical systems with long - range interactions : mean - field spin systems , self - gravitating systems , euler equations in two dimensions , coulomb systems , one - component electron plasma , dipolar systems , free - electron lasers . in section 3 , we discuss the general scenario of dynamical evolution of generic lri systems . in section 4 , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss an illustrative example of lri systems , the kardar - nagel spin system , which involves discrete degrees of freedom , while in section 5 , we discuss a paradigmatic example involving continuous degrees of freedom , the so - called hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model . for the former , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the effects of ensemble inequivalence and slow relaxation , while for the hmf model , we emphasize in particular the occurrence of the so - called quasistationary states ( qsss ) during relaxation towards the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> the qsss are non - equilibrium states with lifetimes that diverge with the system size , so that in the thermodynamic limit , the systems remain trapped in the qsss , thereby making the latter the effective stationary states . in section 5 </S>",
    "<S> , we also discuss an experimental system involving atoms trapped in optical cavities , which may be modelled by the hmf system . in section 6 , we address the issue of ubiquity of the quasistationary behavior by considering a variety of models and dynamics , discussing in each case the conditions to observe qsss . in section 7 </S>",
