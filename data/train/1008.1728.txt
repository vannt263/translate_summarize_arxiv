    "the packing of objects has long fascinated physicists , mathematicians , and the curious .",
    "while the centuries old kepler s conjecture that the maximum packing of spheres is @xmath5 has been finally proven  @xcite , spheres tossed randomly into a jar and shaken , do not reach such high packing fractions , unless special protocols are used  @xcite .",
    "a random closed packed ( rcp ) volume fraction @xmath6 was found by mechanically vibrating a set of steel ball bearings  @xcite .",
    "in fact , work in the last decade has shown that random packing itself is not unique , and there is a range of packing fractions which can be obtained for spherical particles with random order .",
    "these values are bounded at the upper end by @xmath7  @xcite , the so called maximally random close packed state , and more tentatively at the lower end by random loose packing at @xmath8  @xcite .    ,",
    "width=264 ]    in contrast , much less is known for non - spherical particles .",
    "it was only shown a few years ago that randomly packed prolate and oblate objects pack denser than spherical particles  @xcite .",
    "the highest bravais lattice packing of platonic solids are also considered to be the highest packings except in case of the tetrahedrons  @xcite . in the case of tetrahedrons ,",
    "disordered wagon - wheel packings were initially found to pack even higher .",
    "the maximum packing of tetrahedrons has since been improved upon in rapid succession with different approaches  @xcite , and the current highest packing for tetrahedrons stands at 0.856347 .. corresponding to dimer packings of regular tetrahedrons  @xcite .",
    "as noted for spheres , maximum packing tend to be larger than polyhedral packings which may be disordered or ordered when brought together randomly .",
    "for example , quasi - crystals were observed with monte carlo simulation of tetrahedrons by haji - akbari et al  @xcite .",
    "experiments on random packed tetrahedronal dice have been reported recently in ref .",
    "volume fractions were said to be @xmath9 if the observed packings were extrapolated to infinite systems , but the protocol by which the packings were prepared was not clear .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to understand the trends in the observed packings , we have plotted the mean values for each kind of solid and protocol in fig .",
    "[ maxpacking ] along with the maximum known @xmath0 which have been reported  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we find that the data follows the same trend as the theoretical maximum @xmath0 , but is systematically lower because of the disordered nature of their packing .",
    "while lower @xmath0 than maximum can be anticipated , it is somewhat unexpected that the trend for disordered packing reflects the maximum packing .",
    "because the particles we use have friction , and the presence of friction reduces the minimum number of particle contacts needed for static equilibrium from 3 to 2 in three dimensions , it is important to consider its effect on packing . in the case of spheres ,",
    "friction is known to affect packing fractions especially at the loose packing limit  @xcite .",
    "needing fewer neighbors implies the particles are further apart and therefore the packing can be less dense .",
    "it is possible for this reason that we observe a lower dense close packing value for tetrahedrons compared with simulations which found 0.6817 with frictionless tetrahedrons using a relaxation algorithm  @xcite . to explore this further",
    ", we compare packings of the plastic tetrahedrons with the more frictional ceramic tetrahedrons .",
    "we find that for both the unshaken and hand shaken protocols ( see table  [ exp_phi ] ) , the larger the coefficient of friction , the lower the packing fraction with a 9% and 5% lower packing fraction for the ceramic case .",
    "because the plastic dice were expensive , the cost became prohibitive to test with a larger number of dice .",
    "however , ceramic tetrahedrons used in grinding media were relatively inexpensive and we were able to test the number dependence in this case . in fig .",
    "[ ndep ] , we plot the measured packing fraction for numbers ranging from around 100 to 1200 in proportionately larger containers . here",
    "we used the sequential addition and hand shaken protocol ( the particle weight was too high to use our shaker and fluidization experimental setup in this case . ) we find that after @xmath10 , @xmath0 remains constant within experimental error and therefore we believe that @xmath0 reported in table  [ exp_phi ] are representative of even larger packings and surface effects are small .",
    "we measured @xmath0 for each of the platonic solids as a function of frequency while keeping the driving strength @xmath11 constant ( see fig .  [ shaker ] ) .",
    "a peak is observed at @xmath12 hz .",
    "the appearance of peak in frequency can be explained as follows . at the lowest frequencies ,",
    "the particles are tossed up which appears to result in lower packing fractions . whereas , at high frequency particles do not appear to receive sufficient energy to rearrange from initial packings formed after particles are added .          in order to parameterize the randomness in the packings",
    ", we use the images of the packing obtained from the top ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ topimage ] ) and measure the projected area of the largest visible face .",
    "all the projected areas found lie above a minimum ( @xmath13 for the 4,6,8,12 and 20 sided polyhedron respectively ) which is dependent on the geometry of the polyhedron because the projected area is normalized with the area of the face when laying normal to the perpendicular . because of the normalization , the maximum projected area is 1",
    ". we first sample 100 projected area for each platonic solid and preparation technique .",
    "then we calculate the variance among these projected areas ( see fig .  [ order ] ) . for a periodically ordered system",
    ", all the particles would have the same orientation , and therefore the same projected area for the top face .",
    "this implies that the variance of these areas would be zero . as a point of comparison",
    ", we find the variance of 100 random numbers generated in the allowed range for each shape .",
    "this variance represents that of a highly random system .",
    "we find the variance of the projected areas for all shapes except the mechanically shaken cube to be closer to the random number variance than it is to the zero variance for an ordered orientation ( see fig .",
    "[ order ] ) .",
    "as cubes have a strong tendency to align , the variance of the projected areas lies slightly below @xmath14 and closer to the ordered extreme for the mechanically shaken case . from this",
    "we conclude that in most cases we have disordered or random packings .",
    "in fig .  [ maxpacking ] , we also plot the maximum @xmath0 , @xmath15 and @xmath4 for spheres along those for the platonic solids .",
    "the sphere can be considered as a limit of polyhedral shaped particles as the number of sides goes to infinity , and gives a context to understand the observed packing fractions .",
    "as has been noted previously , @xmath16 for all the platonic solids exceed that for spheres , consistent with ulam s conjecture that convex particles pack to a greater @xmath0 than spheres . examining the known maximum packing structure for platonic solids",
    "@xcite it appears that faces align near contacts to give the greater @xmath0 .",
    "however for dense packings , @xmath17 for spheres lies below only the cube and octahedron , but as the trend decreases from the octahedron to the dodecahedron and icosahedrons , it appears that the sphere value would now be approached from below .",
    "finally , in considering the loose extreme , we find that all the platonic solids pack less dense than @xmath4 for spheres .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that all convex particles in the random loose packed configuration pack less dense than a corresponding packing of spheres .",
    "in summary , we have obtained a wide range of packing fractions which depend on the number of faces and edges of the packing solid .",
    "the values systematically depend on the protocols used to create these random packings .",
    "we hypothesize that the limiting values we report correspond approximately to random loose packing and random dense packing for these shapes .",
    "interestingly , we find the overall trend similar to that for the maximum packing fraction .",
    "in contrast with the maximum packings fraction which always exceed that for spheres , the random packings for platonic solids with large number of sides pack looser than for spheres . in closing , we note that our packings of idealized polyhedral particles created with random protocols may give better insight into true packings of faceted particles such as sand found in nature ."
