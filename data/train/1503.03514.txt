    "satellite - based global positioning systems ( gps ) have been available to consumers for many years . when combined with other sensor data , such as terrestrial - based radio signal strength indicators ( rssi ) , the quality of pedestrian localization within cities , at street level",
    ", can be quite reliable .",
    "recently , interest has been gathering for the development of systems for indoor position sensing : we might consider this to be the next challenge in localization systems @xcite .",
    "indoor sensing is likely to require additional infrastructure , such as bluetooth - based rssi , or time - of - flight systems . at the time of writing , both of these",
    "are reported to be under trial .    despite this , vision - based navigation systems are under active development .",
    "this might be because such systems do not require special markers to be embedded within the environment .",
    "however , another reason could be that vision provides an immensely rich source of data , from which estimating position is also possible .",
    "for example , in emerging applications @xcite such as mobile domestic robots , merely knowing where a robot is is not enough : a robot often needs some information about its immediate environment in order to take appropriate decisions .",
    "this includes navigating around obstacles and identifying important objects ( e.g. pets ) .",
    "systems and devices that are designed to help humans to navigate would be improved by incorporating vision as one of the sensing modalities .",
    "this is particularly true of systems that are designed to help visually impaired people to navigate ( assistive navigation systems ) .",
    "however , for wearable or smartphone - based systems , accuracy and power consumption remain two of the challenges to the reliable and continuous use of computer vision techniques .",
    "visual localization accuracy is affected by several factors , including the techniques used to infer location from visual data . in the case of feature - based slam @xcite ,",
    "for example , a lack of features , or a highly occluded environment , can reduce accuracy .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested an interesting approach to localization based on the principle of identifying landmarks in ambient signals .",
    "these ambient signals are acquired from a crowdsourcing - like approach , rather than explicitly mapping out signal strength and wifi identifiers and appears to offer good performance , with median absolute localization error of less than 1.7 m. perhaps more importantly , it removes the need to change building infrastructure specifically for localization .",
    "one way to strengthen the landmark approach would be to incorporate _",
    "cues , automatically mined from the video data . theoretically speaking , such an approach might be limited by i ) the quality of the image acquisition , which could be affected by blur , poor focusing , inadequate resolution or poor lighting ; ii ) the presence of occlusions to otherwise stable visual landmarks ; iii ) visual ambiguity : the presence of visually - similar structures , particularly within man - made environments .",
    "we now consider something of an ideal situation in which we can harvest visual signatures from several journeys down the same route ; the approach starts with the idea of collecting _ visual paths _ , and using the data from these to localize the journeys of users relative to each other , and to start and end points .",
    "consider two users , juan and mary , navigating at different times along the same notional path . by notional path",
    ", we refer to a route that has the same start and end points .",
    "an example of indoor notional paths would be the navigation from one office to another , or from a building entrance to a reception point .",
    "for many buildings , such notional paths might allow different _ physical _ trajectories which could diverge .",
    "for example , users might take either stairs or lifts , creating path splits and merges .",
    "such complex routes could be broken down into route ( or path ) segments , and path segments could contribute to more than one complete notional path .",
    "for any notional path or path segment , both humans and autonomous robots would `` experience '' a series of cues that are distinctive when navigating along that path . in some instances",
    ", however , the cues might be ambiguous , just as they might be for radio signal strength indicators , audio cues and other environmental signals .",
    "a vision - based system would need to analyze the visual structure in sequences from hand - held or wearable cameras along path segments in order to answer two questions : which notional path or segment is being navigated , and where along a specific physical path , relative to start and end point , a person might be .",
    "we addressed the first of these questions in previous work @xcite .",
    "returning to the two - user scenario , let us assume that juan has been the first to navigate along the path , and has collected a sequence of video frames during his successful navigation .",
    "as mary makes her way along the path , we wish to be able to associate the images taken by mary with those taken by juan ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pathexample ] ) . the ability to do this allows us to locate mary relative to the journey of juan _ from the visual data acquired by both_. for only two users , this may seem an uninteresting thing to do .",
    "however , imagine that this association is done between not two , but multiple users , and is applied to several physical paths that together form the navigable space of a building . achieving",
    "this association would enable some types of inference to be performed .",
    "in particular :    * the visual path data would be a new source of data that could be used for location estimation ; * the association of image locations would allow visual change detection to be performed over many journeys along the same route , made at different times ; * through non - simultaneous , many - camera acquisition , one could achieve more accurate mapping of a busy space , particularly where moving obstructions might be present ; * visual object recognition techniques could be applied to recognize the nature of structures encountered along the route , such as exits , doorways and so on .    using continuously acquired images provides a new way for humans to interact with each other through establishing associations between the visual experiences that they have shared , independent of any tags that have been applied .",
    "the concept is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : conceptandheadsup](a ) . in this diagram , four users are within the same region of a building ; however , two pairs of users ( a , c ) and ( b , d ) are associated with having taken similar trajectories to each other . with a sufficient number of users , one could achieve a crowdsourcing of visual navigation information from the collection of users , notional paths and trajectories .",
    "one intriguing possibility would be to provide information to visually - impaired users .",
    "for example , in an assistive system , the visual cues that sighted individuals experience along an indoor journey could be mined , extracting reliable information about position and objects ( e.g. exit signs ) that are of interest .",
    "whilst other sources of indoor positioning information , such as the locations of radio beacons , can aid indoor navigation , some visual cues are likely to be stable over long periods of time , and do not require extra infrastructure beyond that already commonly installed .",
    "collecting distinctive visual cues over many journeys allows stable cues to be learned .",
    "finally , in contrast to signal - based methods of location landmarks @xcite , the `` debugging '' of this type of navigation data  i.e. images , or patches within images  is uniquely human - readable : it can be done simply through human observation of what might have visibly changed along the path .",
    "perhaps most compelling of all , visual path data can be acquired merely by a sighted user sweeping the route with a hand - held or wearable camera .",
    "0.45     0.45",
    "the current state - of - the - art methods for robot navigation make use of simple visual features and realistic robot motion models in order to map , then to navigate . for human navigation ,",
    "the challenge is slightly greater , due partly to the variability of human motion .",
    "nevertheless , recent progress in simultaneous localization and mapping ( slam ) @xcite and parallel tracking and mapping ( ptam ) @xcite have yielded stunning results in producing geometric models of a physical , recovering geometry and camera pose simultaneously from hand - held devices .    at the same time , being able to recognize certain objects whilst performing slam could improve accuracy , reducing the need for loop closure and allowing better  more reliable ",
    "self - calibration @xcite .",
    "recognition pipelines in computer vision have recently taken great strides , both in terms of scalability and accuracy .",
    "thus , the idea of collaboratively mapping out a space through wearable or hand - held cameras is very attractive .",
    "appearance - based navigation , closely related to navigation , has been reported as one of many mechanisms used in biology , and has been explored by various groups in different animals ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "appearance - based approaches can add to the information gained using slam - type algorithms .",
    "indeed , in a robust system , we might expect several sources of localization information to be employed .",
    "consider , for example , outdoor navigation in cities : gps can be combined with wifi rssi .",
    "doing so improves overall accuracy , because the errors in these two localization systems are unlikely to be highly correlated over relatively short length scales ( @xmath0 m ) , and would only be trivially correlated ( but highly ) over longer distances .",
    "localization systems often rely on motion models embedded into tracking algorithms , such as kalman , extended kalman @xcite filtering , or particle - filtering @xcite , to infer position .",
    "more recently , general purpose graphics processing units ( gp - gpus ) have enabled camera position to be quickly and accurately inferred relative to a point cloud by registering whole images with dense textured models @xcite .",
    "anecdotal evidence and conversations with uk groups supporting visually - impaired people suggests that no _ single _ source of data or single type of algorithm will be sufficient to meet the needs of users who are in an unfamiliar space , or who might suffer from visual impairment .",
    "it is likely that a combination of sensors and algorithms is called for .",
    "research into the mechanisms employed by humans during pedestrian navigation suggests that multisensory integration plays a key role @xcite .",
    "indeed , studies into human spatial memory using virtual reality and functional neuroimaging @xcite suggest that the human brain uses a combination of representations to self - localize that might be termed as _ allocentric _ and _ egocentric_. the egocentric representation supports identifying a location based on sensory patterns recognized from previous experiences in a given location .",
    "allocentric representations use a reference frame that is independent of one s location .",
    "the respective coordinate systems can , of course , be interchanged via simple transformations , but the sensory and cognitive processes underlying navigation in both cases are thought to be different .",
    "the two forms of representation are typified by different types of cells , and , in some cases , different neuronal signal pathways . within some mammals , such as mice",
    ", it appears that a multitude of further sub - divisions of computational mechanisms lie behind location and direction encoding .",
    "for example , in the hippocampus , there are at least four classes @xcite of encoding associated with position and heading .",
    "hippocampal _ place cells _ display elevated firing when the animal is in a particular location @xcite .",
    "the environmental cues that affect hippocampal place cells include vision and odour , so the inputs to these cells are not necessarily limited to any one type of sensory input .",
    "grid cells , on the other hand , show increased firing rates when the animal is present at a number of locations on a spatial grid ; this suggests that some form of joint neuronal encoding is at work , and , indeed , there is some evidence that place cell responses arise through a combination of grid cells of different spacing @xcite .",
    "boundary cells in the hippocampus appear to encode just that : the distance to the boundaries of a spatial region .",
    "this encoding seems to be relative to the direction the animal is facing but independent of the relation between the animal s head and body ; they are therefore , examples of an allocentric scheme .    in conclusion , biology seems to employ not only several sensory inputs to enable an organism to locate itself relative to the environment , but also different computational mechanisms . the evidence of these multiple strategies for localization and navigation @xcite motivates the idea for an appearance - based localization algorithm .",
    "a total of 60 videos were acquired from 6 corridors of the rsm building at imperial college london .",
    "two different devices were used .",
    "one was a lg google nexus 4 mobile phone running android 4.4.2 `` kitkat '' .",
    "the video data was acquired at approximately 24 - 30 fps at two different acquisition resolutions , corresponding to @xmath1 and @xmath2 pixels . the other device was a wearable google glass ( 2013 explorer edition ) acquiring data at a resolution of @xmath1 , and a frame rate of around 30 fps .",
    "a surveyor s wheel ( silverline ) with a precision of 10 cm and error of @xmath3 was used to record distance , but was modified by connecting the encoder to the general purpose input / output ( gpio ) pins of a raspberry pi running a number of measurement processes .",
    "the pi was synchronized to network time using network time protocol ( ntp ) , enabling synchronization with timestamps in the video sequence .",
    "because of the variable frame rate of acquisition , timestamp data from the video was used to align ground - truth measurements with frames .",
    "this data is used to assess the accuracy of estimating positions , and not for any form of training .    in total",
    ", 3.05 km of data is contained in this dataset , at a natural indoor walking speed . for each corridor ,",
    "ten passes ( i.e.  10 separate visual paths ) are obtained ; five of these are acquired with the hand - held nexus , and the other five with glass .",
    "table  [ tbl : datasets ] summarizes the acquisition .",
    "as can be seen , the length of the sequences varies within some corridors ; this is due to a combination of different walking speeds and/or different frame rates .",
    "lighting also varied , due to a combination of daylight / nighttime acquisitions , and occasional windows acting as strong lighting sources in certain sections of the building .",
    "changes were also observable in some videos from one pass to another due to the presence of changes ( path obstructions being introduced during a cleaning activity ) and occasional appearances of people .",

    "the dataset is publicly available for download at http://rsm.bicv.org @xcite .",
    "we evaluated the performance of different approaches to query images taken from one visual path against others stored in the database . in order to index and query visual path datasets",
    ", we used the steps illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : figpipeline ] . the details behind each of the steps ( e.g. gradient estimation , spatial pooling )",
    "are described in the remainder of this section .",
    "they include techniques that operate on _ single _ frames as well as descriptors that operate on _ multiple _ frames , at the frame level and at the patch level .",
    "all the performance evaluation experiments were carried out at low - resolution ( 208@xmath6117 pixels ) versions of the sequences , keeping bandwidth and processing requirements small .    .",
    "variants of the gradient operators , pooling operators , quantization and distance metrics are described in section [ sec : index ] . ]",
    "based on the use of optical flow in motion estimation  @xcite and space - time descriptors in action recognition @xcite we estimated in - plane motion vectors using a simple approach .",
    "we first applied derivative filters along @xmath7 dimensions , yielding a 2d@xmath8 , i.e. spatio - temporal , gradient field . to capture variations in chromatic content from the visual sequence , we computed these spatio - temporal gradients separately for each of the three rgb channels of the pre - processed video sequences .",
    "this yielded a @xmath9 matrix at each point in space .",
    "temporal smoothing was applied along the time dimension , with a support of 11 neighbouring frames . finally , the components of the matrix were each averaged ( pooled ) over 16 distinct spatial regions , not very dissimilar to those to be described later in this paper .",
    "for each visual path , this yielded 144 signals , of length approximately equal to the video sequences .",
    "an illustration of the time series for one visual path is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : traces ] .        at each point in time , the values over the 144 signal channels are also captured into a _",
    "single _ space - time descriptor per frame : lw_color .",
    "our observations from the components of this descriptor are that a ) relative ego - motion is clearly identifiable in the signals ; b ) stable patterns of motion may also be identified , though changes in the precise trajectory of a user could also lead to perturbations in these signals , and hence to changes in the descriptor vectors .",
    "minor changes in trajectory might , therefore , reduce one s ability to match descriptors between users .",
    "these observations , together with the possibility of partial occlusion , led us to the use of _ patch _ based descriptors , so that multiple descriptors would be produced for each frame . these are introduced next .",
    "the patch descriptors can be further divided into two categories : those produced from patches of single frames , and those that are based on patches acquired over multiple frames ; the latter are _ space - time _ patch descriptors .",
    "we explored two distinct single - frame descriptors , and three distinct space - time descriptors .",
    "we first describe the single - frame descriptors .",
    "the spatial patch descriptors consist of the dense - sift descriptor @xcite and a tuned , odd - symmetric gabor - based descriptor .",
    "the sift descriptor was calculated by dense sampling of the smoothed estimate of @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the scale - space embedding of image @xmath12 within a gaussian scale - space at scale @xmath13 .",
    "we used a standard implementation of dense sift from vlfeat  @xcite with scale parameter , @xmath14 , and with a stride length of 3 pixels .",
    "this yielded around @xmath15 descriptors per frame , each describing a patch of roughly @xmath16 pixels in the frame .",
    "we compared these with another single - frame technique devised in our lab : we used filters that we previously tuned on pascal voc data @xcite for image categorization .",
    "these consisted of @xmath17-directional , 9 @xmath18 9 pixels spatial gabor filters ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ) .",
    "each filter gives rise to a filtered image plane , denoted @xmath21 .",
    "for each plane , we applied spatial convolution ( @xmath22 ) with a series of pooling functions :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is computed by spatial sampling of the pooling function :    @xmath25 ^ 2 - \\beta | \\theta-\\theta_m | \\right \\rbrace \\label{eq : pool1}\\ ] ]    with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 were taken to construct 8 regions at angles @xmath30 for each of two distances @xmath31 , @xmath32 away from the centre of a spatial pooling region in the image plane .",
    "for the central region , corresponding to @xmath33 , there was no angular variation , but a log - radial exponential decay .",
    "this yielded a total of 17 spatial pooling regions .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 fields were sub - sampled to produce a dense 136-dimensional descriptors , each representing an approximately @xmath16 pixels image region .",
    "this resulted in , again , approximately 2,000 descriptors per image frame after the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conv ] ) is sub - sampled .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : isopool ] .          given the potential richness available in the capture of space - time information , we explored three distinct approaches to generate space - time patch descriptors .",
    "these approaches all lead to multiple descriptors per frame , and all take into account neighbouring frames in time when generating the descriptor associated with each patch .",
    "additionally , all three densely sample the video sequence .",
    "the three methods are i ) hog 3d , introduced by @xcite ; our space - time , antisymmetric gabor filtering process ( st_gabor ) ; and iii ) our spatial derivative , temporal gaussian ( st_gauss ) filter .    1 .",
    "the hog 3d descriptor ( hog3d ) @xcite was introduced to extend the very successful two - dimensional histogram of oriented gradients technique @xcite to space - time fields , in the form of video sequences .",
    "hog 3d seeks computational efficiencies by smoothing using box filters , rather than gaussian spatial or space - time kernels .",
    "this allows three - dimensional gradient estimation across multiple scales using the _ integral video _ representation , a direct extension of the integral image idea @xcite .",
    "the gradients from this operation are usually performed across multiple scales .",
    "we used the dense hog 3d option from the implementation of the authors @xcite , and the settings yielded approximately 2,000 descriptors per frame of video .",
    "space - time gabor ( st_gabor ) functions have been used in activity recognition , structure from motion and other applications @xcite .",
    "we performed one dimensional convolution between the video sequence and three one - dimensional gabor functions along either one spatial dimension i.e.  @xmath35 or @xmath36 , or along @xmath37 .",
    "the one - dimensional convolution is crude , but appropriate if the videos have been downsampled .",
    "the spatial extent of the gabor was set to provide one complete cycle of oscillation over approximately 5 pixels of spatial span , both for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 spatial dimensions .",
    "the filter for the temporal dimension was set to provide temporal support and one oscillation over approximately 9 frames .",
    "we also explored symmetric gabor functions , but found them less favourable in early performance tests .",
    "+ after performing three separate filtering operations , each pixel of each frame was assigned a triplet of values corresponding to the result of the each filtering operation .",
    "the three values were treated as being components of a 3d vector . over a spatial extent of around @xmath38 pixels taken at the central frame of the 9-frame support region ,",
    "these vectors contribute weighted votes into 13 histogram bins according to their azimuth and elevations , with the weighting being given by the length of the vector .",
    "the votes were also partitioned into 17 regions according to the approximate spatial lobe pattern illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : isopool ] , yielding a 221-dimension descriptor .",
    "3 .   a final variant of space - time patch descriptor was designed .",
    "this consisted of spatial derivatives in space , combined with smoothing over time ( st_gauss ) . in contrast to the strictly one - dimensional filtering operation used for the space - time gabor descriptor , we used two @xmath39 gradient masks for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions based on derivatives of gaussian functions , and an 11-point gaussian smoothing filter in the temporal direction with a standard deviation of 2 .",
    "8-directional quantization was applied to the angles of the gradient field , and a weighted gradient magnitude voting process was used to distribute votes across the 8 bins of a 136-dimensional descriptor . like the st_gabor descriptor , pooling regions were created , similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isopool ] .",
    "our initial conjecture was that whole frames from a sequence could be indexed compactly , using the single - frame descriptor ( lw_color ) .",
    "this was found to lead to disappointing performance ( see section  [ sec : performance ] ) .",
    "for the case of many descriptors - per - frame i.e.  descriptors that are patch - based , we have the problem of generating around 2,000 descriptors per frame , if dense sampling is used .",
    "thus , we applied vector quantization ( vq ) to the descriptors , then used histograms of vq descriptors , effectively representing each frame as a histogram of words @xcite .",
    "the dictionary was always built by excluding the entire journey from which queries are to be taken .",
    "two different approaches to the vq of descriptors were taken , one based on standard @xmath40-means , using a euclidean distance measure ( hard assignment , `` ha '' ) , and one corresponding to the vector of locally aggregated descriptors ( vlad ) @xcite .",
    "for vlad , a @xmath40-means clustering was first performed .",
    "for each descriptor , sums of residual vectors were used to improve the encoding .",
    "further advances to the basic vlad , which include different normalizations and multiscale approaches , are given by @xcite .",
    "to compare encodings , either @xmath41 or hellinger distance metrics @xcite were used to retrieve results for ha and vlad encoding approaches respectively .",
    "distance comparisons were performed directly between either hard assigned bag - of - words ( bow ) or vlad image encodings arising from collections of descriptors for each frame .",
    "the methods for a ) describing spatial or space - time structure , b ) indexing and comparing the data are summarized in table  [ tbl : methods ] .",
    "the choice of parameters was selected to allow a ) as consistent a combination of methods as possible , allowing fair comparisons of the effect of one type of encoding or spatio - temporal operator to be isolated from others b ) to select parameter choices close to other research in the area , e.g.  for image categorization , dictionary sizes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 words are common .",
    ".a summary of the different encoding methods and their relationships to different descriptors .",
    "the number of elements of each descriptor is also reported ( * dim * ) . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : summaries ]    finally , we applied one implementation of the simultaneous localization and mapping technique ( slam ) to this dataset , at the same frame resolution as for the appearance - based localization discussed in this paper .",
    "we chose the `` ekf mono slam '' @xcite , which uses an extended kalman filter ( ekf ) with 1-point ransac .",
    "we chose this implementation for three reasons : a ) it is a monocular slam technique , so comparison with the single - camera approach is fairer ; b ) the authors of this package report error estimates  in the form of error distributions ; and c ) the errors from video with similar resolutions ( 240 @xmath18 320 ) to ours were reported as being below 2 m for some sequences @xcite in their dataset .",
    "the results of the comparison were surprising , and somewhat unsatisfactory .",
    "the challenging ambiguity of the sequences in the rsm dataset , and possibly the low resolution of the queries , might explain the results .",
    "the feature detector , a fast corner detector @xcite , produced a small number of features in its original configuration .",
    "we lowered the feature detection threshold until the system worked on a small number of frames from each sequence .",
    "even with more permissive thresholds , the average number of fast features averaged only 20 across our experiments .",
    "this small number of features led to inaccuracy in the position estimates , causing many of the experimental runs to stop when no features could be matched .",
    "the small number of features per frame is also not comparable with the feature density of the methods described in this paper , where an average of 2,000 features per frame was obtained for the `` dense '' approaches .",
    "dense slam algorithms might fare better .",
    "the performance comparisons shown in the cumulative error distributions of fig .  [ fig : cdfall ] would seem a fairly natural means of capturing localization performance . yet",
    ", they do not suggest large differences in terms of the auc metric ( table  [ table : summaries ] ) , given the large diversity in the complexity of the indexing methods . however , absolute position estimation errors tell a different story : average absolute errors are as high as 4 metres for the worst performing method ( hog3d ) , and just over 1.3 metres for the best performing method ( sf_gabor ) , if the same camera is used . the best performance compares very favourably with reported errors in positioning from multi - point wifi signal strength measurements using landmark - based recognition that employs multiple ( non - visual ) sensing @xcite . indeed , it is very likely that the size of the errors we have observed can be reduced by incorporating simple motion models and a tracker , in the form of a kalman filter .",
    "a surprising result was that good levels of accuracy were obtained for images as small as @xmath44 pixels .",
    "this suggests that relatively low - resolution cameras can be used to improve the performance of indoor localization systems .",
    "being able to use such low resolutions of image reduces the indexing time , storage , power and bandwidth requirements .",
    "the advent of wearable and hand - held cameras makes appearance - based localization feasible .",
    "interaction between users and their wearable device would allow for new applications such as localization , navigation and semantic descriptions of the environment . additionally , the ability to crowdsource `` visual paths '' against which users could match their current views is a realistic scenario given ever improving connectivity .",
    "we evaluated several types of descriptor in this retrieval - based localization scenario , achieving errors as small as 1.30 m over a 50 m distance of travel .",
    "this is surprising , given that we used low - resolution versions of our images , and particularly since our rsm dataset also contains very ambiguous indoor scenes .",
    "we are currently working on enlarging the rsm database , by including larger numbers of journeys .",
    "a future goal will be to!h mitigate the effects of partial occlusion between different views of the same physical location .",
    "for example , face - detection might be applied to identify when and where people are within the scene acquired along a users journey ; we would avoid generating descriptors that covered these regions of image space .",
    "other movable objects ( chairs , trolleys ) could also be actively detected and removed from indexing or queries .",
    "the challenges associated with searching across video from multiple devices would still need to be solved .",
    "we can see from section [ sec : performance ] that between - device queries have much higher error than within - device queries .",
    "this problem can be solved by either capturing and indexing data from a variety of devices for the same journeys , or by learning a mapping between devices .",
    "another obvious strand of work would be to incorporate information from other sources , such as rssi indicators , to reduce localization error .",
    "finally , we are exploring ways to combine the appearance - based technique described in this paper with slam and its variants . doing this would allow geometric models from independent point - cloud sets to be associated with each other , allowing the continuous updating of the models that describe a physical space .",
    "multiple geometric models , acquired from otherwise independent journeys , would support more detailed and reliable descriptions of an indoor , navigable space .",
    "it would also allow better interaction between the users of a building with its features , and with each other .",
    "our long - term goal is to convey the information acquired by sighted users to help people with visual impairment ; this would require creating and updating rich descriptions of the visual and geometric structure of a physical space .",
    "this could be used in the making of indoor navigational aides , which would be rendered through haptic or audio interfaces , making the planning of journeys easier for the visually impaired .",

    "<S> we evaluated different types of image and video frame descriptors that could be used to determine distinctive visual landmarks for localizing a person based on what is seen by a camera that they carry . to do this </S>",
    "<S> , we created a database containing over 3 km of video - sequences with ground - truth in the form of distance travelled along different corridors . using this database , the accuracy of localization  both in terms of knowing which route a user is on  and in terms of position along a certain route , can be evaluated . for each type of descriptor </S>",
    "<S> , we also tested different techniques to encode visual structure and to search between journeys to estimate a user s position . </S>",
    "<S> the techniques include single - frame descriptors , those using sequences of frames , and both colour and achromatic descriptors . </S>",
    "<S> we found that single - frame indexing worked better within this particular dataset . </S>",
    "<S> this might be because the motion of the person holding the camera makes the video too dependent on individual steps and motions of one particular journey . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that appearance - based information could be an additional source of navigational data indoors , augmenting that provided by , say , radio signal strength indicators ( rssis ) . </S>",
    "<S> such visual information could be collected by crowdsourcing low - resolution video feeds , allowing journeys made by different users to be associated with each other , and location to be inferred without requiring explicit mapping . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a complementary approach to methods based on simultaneous localization and mapping ( slam ) algorithms .    </S>",
