    "plasmas in magnetic - confinement - fusion plasmas are turbulent , due to the presence of strong spatial gradients .",
    "turbulence is often observed accompanied by zonal ( i.e. axisymmetric ) radial electric fields , generating poloidal exb flows in tokamaks .",
    "these zonal flows are usually constituted by two components , one nearly constant in time , dubbed zero - frequency zonal flows ( zfzfs )  @xcite , and one oscillating with a frequency of the order of the sound frequency ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the sound speed and @xmath2 is the tokamak major radius ) , dubbed geodesic acoustic modes ( gams )  @xcite .",
    "the importance of both components is due to their nonlinear interaction with turbulence , for they shear and distort convective and turbulent cells leading to the turbulence saturation and consequently to a reduction of the transport .",
    "the peculiarity of gam oscillations resides in the different shearing efficiency that the zonal flows have in relation to their oscillatory behavior .",
    "in fact , while zfzfs suppress turbulence efficiently , oscillations make the action of the zonal flow less effective  @xcite .",
    "zfs / gams are also known to transfer energy to the long - wavelength components of the turbulence  @xcite .",
    "historically , the landau damping has been recognized as one of the main damping mechanisms of gams .",
    "the landau damping is due to the nonuniformity of the ion distribution function in velocity - space , and it is therefore an intrinsically kinetic effect . its evaluation has been performed with increasing accuracy , where finite - orbit - width ( fow ) of the passing ions were initially neglected  @xcite , then included to the first order  @xcite , then included to higher orders  @xcite . finally , the effect of the flux surface shape was also included  @xcite .",
    "all analytical calculations of the landau damping of gams have been performed so far by assuming a uniform plasma , i.e. by neglecting the effect of a gradient of the equilibrium density or temperature profiles .",
    "more recently , the phase mixing , which was previously investigated for non - ionized fluids  @xcite , for langmuir waves in plasmas  @xcite , and for shear - alfvn waves in plasmas  @xcite , has also been investigated for gams analytically  @xcite .",
    "contrarily to the landau damping , the phase mixing can be studied also in fluid theory , whenever the local spectrum of oscillation of a wave - the _ continuous spectrum _ - varies in space ( for the gam in a tokamak , this happens due to the variation of the plasma temperature across the magnetic flux - surfaces ) . in this case , the spatial shape of a perturbation will be deformed in time due to the effect of the different frequency of oscillation , occurring at different positions . when performing a fourier transform in space",
    ", the effect of the phase mixing is that of shifting the peak of the perturbation in time , towards higher values of the wavenumber .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the perturbation in fourier space calculated at the initial wavenumber , decays in time , giving rise to the _ continuum damping_. gyrokinetic simulations of gams with realistic profiles of asdex upgrade had already shown a peculiar behaviour at the edge , which was not been possible to explain with a description based on the landau damping alone  @xcite .",
    "in particular the damping rate at the edge , where the temperature profile is steep , was measured to be much stronger than that predicted by the theory of landau damping .",
    "more recently , the investigation of this strong damping observed in gyrokinetic simulations has started , showing a new mechanism based upon the combined action of the phase mixing and the landau damping , and the first results have been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we complete the level of understanding of this problem , by describing the details of the combined effect of the nonuniformities in velocity- and in real - space , causing the cascade in the wavenumber and the effective damping at high wavenumbers , with a dedicated initial - value code and diagnostics .",
    "in fact , as previously mentioned , the phase mixing , acting because of the nonuniformity in space , damps only each single mode in fourier space by continuum damping , but in the whole real space the energy of the electric field is conserved , so the actual total damping is zero . therefore , although our analysis is linear , we can state that the values of the damping rate calculated as pure landau damping and as pure phase mixing do not just _ linearly _ sum up .",
    "in fact , the landau damping of gams strongly increases with the radial wave number , due to the finite orbit width of the passing ions .",
    "consequently the effect of the phase mixing is to greatly amplify the efficiency of the landau damping .",
    "this general effect , recently proved to be crucial ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , is explored here in specific cases chosen for their practical experimental relevance , and quantitatively proved to be indispensabile for an interpretation of realistic gam dynamics . in particular , the phase mixing and landau damping are first studied separately and then the resulting combined effect is shown to form a cascade of the energy in wavenumber ( analogously to that generated in a turbulent system ) with a strong absorption at the small scales  @xcite , which is reproduced here quantitatively with a dedicated initial value code .",
    "the investigation of the landau damping with analytical theory and numerical simulations with orb5 was performed already in ref .",
    "@xcite , and recalled here for sake of completeness .",
    "the investigation of the phase mixing , on the other hand , is performed in this work with the help of an initial value code which solves the gam dynamics by adopting the real part of the kinetic frequency , and neglects its imaginary part .",
    "this initial value code for the study of the phase mixing , is used to reproduce the evolution of the radial structure of the gam perturbation , modified by the phase mixing alone .    in tokamaks , the combined effect of landau damping and phase mixing can play a crucial role in the dynamics and in the decay of gam at the tokamak edge , where the temperature gradients are very large .",
    "depending on the confinement regime , low confinement ( l - mode ) , improved ( low ) confinement ( i - mode ) and high confinement ( h - mode ) , different parameter values are achieved in the experiments , in particular changing the relative strength of temperature and density gradients at the edge of the plasma .",
    "the sequence of events in the transition phases between these regimes , particularly regarding the turbulence suppression , the development of the edge temperature and density gradients and the increase of the shear flow , is not completely established yet .",
    "gams are considered to be potential key players in the dynamics of the transition to i- and to h - modes  @xcite , and their absence can enhance the effects of the shear flow on the turbulence  @xcite .",
    "gams are reported to be regularly observed in l - mode , and are also observed in i - mode , whereas they are not observed in h - mode .",
    "it will be shown that the proposed mechanism of gam decay is consistent with the observed existence or non - existence of gams in the different confinement regimes  @xcite .",
    "our investigation is carried out by means of analytical theory and numerical simulations .",
    "for the numerical simulations , we use the global particle - in - cell code orb5  @xcite , which now includes all extensions made in the nemorb project  @xcite .",
    "the orb5 code uses a lagrangian formulation based on the gyrokinetic vlasov - maxwell equations  @xcite . due to the method of derivation of the gk vlasov - maxwell equations from a discretized lagrangian",
    ", the symmetry properties of the starting lagrangian are passed to the vlasov - maxwell equations , and the conservation theorems for the energy and momentum are automatically satisfied  @xcite .",
    "the code solves the full - f gyrokinetic vlasov equation for ions and the drift - kinetic equation for electrons .",

    "in this section , we recall the results about the landau damping of gams in uniform plasmas , i.e. in the absence of gradients of the equilibrium profiles ( i.e. the safety factor , density and temperature profiles are flat ) , shown in ref .",
    "the gam dynamics is independent on the radius to a good approximation , and the radial shape of the initial perturbation does not change in time , at least for the first few gam oscillations ( after which , global effects can occur ) . for our regimes of interest , a linear estimation of the frequency and damping rate",

    "ronsebluth - hinton tests similar to those described in the previous section are performed , but with the main difference that the equilibrium radial profiles are not considered flat .",

    "<S> geodesic acoustic modes ( gams ) are oscillations of the electric field whose importance in tokamak plasmas is due to their role in the regulation of turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the linear collisionless damping of gams is investigated here by means of analytical theory and numerical simulations with the global gyrokinetic particle - in - cell code orb5 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined effect of the phase mixing and landau damping is found to quickly redistribute the gam energy in phase - space , due to the synergy of the finite orbit width of the passing ions and the cascade in wave number given by the phase mixing . </S>",
    "<S> when plasma parameters characteristic of realistic tokamak profiles are considered , the gam decay time is found to be an order of magnitude lower than the decay due to the landau damping alone , and in some cases of the same order of magnitude of the characteristic gam drive time due to the nonlinear interaction with an itg mode . in particular , the radial mode structure evolution in time is investigated here and reproduced quantitatively by means of a dedicated initial value code and diagnostics .     </S>"
