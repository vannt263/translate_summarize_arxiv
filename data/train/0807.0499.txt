    "we characterize each motor species by six parameters as measured in single molecule experiments ( see table  1  and text in the supporting information ( si ) ) as follows : it binds to a mt with the binding rate @xmath10 and unbinds with the unbinding rate @xmath11 , which increases exponentially under external force , with the force scale given by the detachment force @xmath12 .",
    "when bound to the mt , the motor walks forward with the velocity @xmath13 , which decreases with external force and reaches zero at the stall force @xmath14 . under superstall external forces , the motor walks backward slowly with backward velocity @xmath15 .",

    "<S> intracellular transport is based on molecular motors that pull cargos along cytoskeletal filaments . </S>",
    "<S> one motor species always moves in one direction , e.g. conventional kinesin moves to the microtubule plus end , while cytoplasmic dynein moves to the microtubule minus end . </S>",
    "<S> however , many cellular cargos are observed to move bidirectionally , involving both plus - end and minus - end directed motors . </S>",
    "<S> the presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional transport is provided by a tug - of - war between the two motor species . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism is studied theoretically using the load - dependent transport properties of individual motors as measured in single - molecule experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous expectations , such a tug - of - war is found to be highly cooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the precise values of the single motor parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the transport process to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its cargo traffic .    </S>",
    "<S> the complex internal structure of biological cells depends to a large extent on targeted transport of vesicles , organelles and other types of cargo . </S>",
    "<S> this active intracellular transport displays the counterintuitive property that many cargos are observed to move bidirectionally , reversing direction every few seconds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this saltatory motion , which is faster and more persistent than brownian motion , has been known for a long time @xcite . with the improvement of experimental techniques , </S>",
    "<S> bidirectional motion has been found to be widespread , including particles such as mitochondria , pigment granules , endosomes , lipid - droplets , and viruses @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the long - range intracellular traffic inside biological cells is powered by molecular motors which transport cargos along microtubules ( mts ) . </S>",
    "<S> some motors such as cytoplasmic dynein walk to the minus end , while others such as kinesin  1 or 2 walk to the plus end of the mts . </S>",
    "<S> cells often have a unidirectional mt cytoskeleton : the mt minus ends are typically located near the cell center , while the plus ends point outwards towards the cell periphery . </S>",
    "<S> polarized cells like epithelial cells or axons possess a unipolar parallel mt array . because of this unidirectional nature of the mt network and the motors , both plus and minus </S>",
    "<S> motors must be involved in the bidirectional transport of a single cargo . indeed both kinesin and dynein are found simultaneously on various cellular cargos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a matter of current research how the two motor species accomplish the bidirectional transport @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two scenarios seem plausible @xcite : ( i ) _ tug - of - war_. each motor species tries to move the cargo into its own direction , thereby performing a ` tug - of - war ' on the cargo as depicted in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ coordination_. an additional coordination complex prevents opposing motors from being active at the same time , thereby excluding state ( 0 )  in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> in both cases , regulatory mechanisms , which may directly target the motors or the putative coordination complex , must be present in order to allow the cell to alter its motor transport in response to internal or external stimuli .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed fast motion , and the complexity of bidirectional transport , as briefly reviewed in the following paragraphs , has led many authors to reject a tug - of - war scenario and search for a coordination complex . however , as shown in this article , this rejection of the tug - of - war scenario is premature since a realistic tug - of - war leads to rather complex transport behavior that is not easily understood intuitively and , thus , may be erroneously interpreted as coordinated transport .    )  of motors bound to the mt . for configuration ( 0 ) , the motors block each other so that the cargo does not move . for configuration </S>",
    "<S>   and ( @xmath0 ) , the cargo exhibits fast plus and minus motion , respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> most quantitative data have been obtained experimentally in two model systems : pigment granule transport in fish and frog melanophores @xcite and lipid - droplet transport in _ drosophila _  embryos @xcite . in melanophores , which are specialized pigment cells responsible for skin color , pigment granules move bidirectionally with similar velocities in both directions . </S>",
    "<S> they achieve net minus - end transport during an aggregation period because the average distance traveled in minus direction ( the minus run length ) is longer than the average distance traveled in plus direction ( the plus run length ) . during a dispersion period </S>",
    "<S> , there is almost no net transport because of an increased minus run length @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> lipid - droplets are storage organelles for lipids . in late _ drosophila _  </S>",
    "<S> embryos , they move on a unipolar mt array in the egg periphery . </S>",
    "<S> their bidirectional motion exhibits different patterns in different stages of embryonic development . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , from so - called phase ii to iii their net transport direction changes from plus to minus because of an increase in the minus run length @xcite . this system is the only one for which force measurements have been performed so far . </S>",
    "<S> stall forces have been found equal in plus and minus direction , independent of the net direction of droplet transport @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> various proteins that are necessary for the proper function or regulation of motor transport have been identified @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples are the dynein cofactor dynactin , which is necessary for bidirectional transport in melanophores @xcite , or proteins like halo , klar or lds2 in the lipid - droplet system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> motor transport was found to be affected both by intracellular regulation and by mutational changes in the motor structure . </S>",
    "<S> first , cellular regulation often leads to changes in only one direction . in the lipid - droplet system , net transport during embryogenesis </S>",
    "<S> is altered via a change in the plus run length @xcite , while in the melanophore system during skin color change the minus run length is changed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , herpesvirus capsids achieve targeting during entry and egress by modulation of the plus run length @xcite . in all cases , </S>",
    "<S> the other direction is left unaltered . </S>",
    "<S> second , mutation of the plus or minus motor mostly causes reduced motion in both directions by decreasing run lengths or velocities , as observed by mutating dynein on lipid - droplets @xcite and kinesin on axonal protein carrying vesicles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in melanophores , kinesin inactivation leads to breakdown of plus motion and increased minus run lengths @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interfering with the dynein - cofactor dynactin impairs transport in both directions in melanophores @xcite , but impairs minus and enhances plus transport of adenovirus particles @xcite . in the only _ in vitro _  </S>",
    "<S> experiment concerning bidirectional transport @xcite , a motility assay of kinesin and dynein , it was observed that increasing the number of dyneins enhances minus and impairs plus end transport .     </S>",
    "<S> plus ( blue ) motors and @xmath1 minus ( yellow ) motors is pulled by a fluctuating number of motors bound to the mt . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration in the middle corresponds to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> only 5 out of 12 possible @xmath3 configurations are displayed . ]    as shown in this article , all of these experimental observations are consistent with the tug - of - war mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we present the first explicit tug - of - war model that takes into account the experimentally known single motor properties and makes quantitative predictions for bidirectional transport . in our model , the motors act independently and interact only mechanically via their common cargo . </S>",
    "<S> we find seven possible motility regimes for cargo transport . </S>",
    "<S> three of these regimes are dominated by the three configurations ( 0 ) ,  , and ( @xmath0 )  in fig .  1  and represent no motion , fast plus motion , and fast minus motion of the cargo , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the other motility states are combinations thereof ; in particular , there are the two regimes ( @xmath4 )  and ( @xmath00@xmath5 )  where the cargo displays fast bidirectional transport without and with pauses , respectively . during fast plus or minus motion , </S>",
    "<S> only one motor type is pulling most of the time and the tug - of - war appears to be coordinated .    </S>",
    "<S> the different motility regimes are found for certain ranges of single - motor parameters such as stall force and mt affinity . </S>",
    "<S> small changes in these parameters lead to drastic changes in cargo transport , e.g. from fast plus motion to bidirectional motion or no motion . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that cells could use the sensitivity of the transport to the single - motor properties to regulate its traffic in a very efficient manner . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this general proposal by providing an explicit and quantitative tug - of - war model for the lipid - droplet system . </S>"
