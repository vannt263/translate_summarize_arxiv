    "in this paper , we analyze point - to - point communication of energy harvesting nodes from an information - theoretic perspective .",
    "we focus on wireless networking applications where nodes ( e.g. , sensors nodes ) can harvest energy from nature through various different sources , such as solar cells , vibration absorption devices , water mills , thermoelectric generators , microbial fuel cells , etc . in such systems ,",
    "energy that becomes available for data transmission can be modeled as an exogenous recharge process .",
    "therefore , unlike traditional battery - powered systems , in these systems , energy is not a deterministic quantity , but is a random process which varies stochastically in time at a scale on the order of symbol duration .",
    "the transmission can be interrupted due to lack of energy in the battery . on the other hand ,",
    "excess energy can be buffered in the battery before consumption for transmission .",
    "this model requires a major shift in terms of the power constraint imposed on the channel input compared to those in the existing literature .    to illustrate , in information - theoretic approaches ,",
    "there are two widely used input constraints on the channel inputs of continuous - alphabet channels : average power constraint and amplitude constraint .",
    "if the input is average power constrained , then any codeword should be such that while each symbol can take any real value , the average power of the entire codeword should be no more than the power constraint .",
    "on the other hand , if the input is amplitude constrained , then every code symbol should be less than the constraint in amplitude .",
    "it is clear that in an energy harvesting model , the constraint imposed on the channel input is different than these constraints , in that , while code symbols are instantaneously amplitude constrained , energy can be saved in the battery for later use .",
    "this amounts to an unprecedented input constraint on the channel input . in this context",
    ", the main goal of this paper is to investigate the effect of stochastic energy arrivals on the communication in an information - theoretic framework . in particular , we augment an energy buffer to the classical awgn system and study information - theoretically achievable rates .    first , we consider the setting where energy arrives at the transmitter as a stochastic process , which varies on the order of symbol duration .",
    "the problem is posed as design of a codebook that complies with all of the input constraints .",
    "the input constraint imposed by stochastic energy arrivals is a random one and in this sense it generalizes classical deterministic average or amplitude power constraints .",
    "the recharge process together with past code symbols determine the allowable range of inputs in each channel use .",
    "we start with showing that the capacity of the awgn channel with an average power constraint equal to the average recharge rate is an upper bound for the capacity in the energy harvesting system .",
    "then , we develop a scheme called _ save - and - transmit _ scheme that achieves this upper bound and hence the capacity .",
    "the _ save - and - transmit _ scheme relies on sending zero code symbols in a portion of the total block length , which becomes negligible as the block length gets larger .",
    "next , based on feasibility to send the code symbol in a channel use , we provide an alternative scheme called the _ best - effort - transmit _",
    "scheme for achieving the capacity .",
    "whenever the available energy is sufficient to send the code symbol , it is put to the channel , while a zero is put to the channel if there is not enough energy in the battery .",
    "we show that this scheme achieves rates arbitrarily close to the capacity .",
    "secondly , we address a typical behavior in certain energy harvesting sensors , such as solar - powered sensors , where the recharge process is not ergodic or stationary . in this case",
    ", we assume that the average recharging rate is not a constant in time , but rather fosters time variation in a scale much larger than the time scale that communication takes place .",
    "accordingly , we extend the formulation to the case in which recharge process has a mean value that is varying in sufficiently long time and we call each such sufficiently long time a slot .",
    "we derive the optimal power control for maximum average throughput in this case , and provide a geometric interpretation for the resulting power allocation .",
    "we illustrate the advantage of the optimal power allocation in a numerical study .      to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this work is the first attempt to analyze an energy harvesting communication system from an information - theoretic perspective .",
    "there are many motivating works in the networking literature . in @xcite , lei _",
    "address replenishment in one hop transmission . formulating transmission strategy as a markov decision process ,",
    "@xcite uses dynamic programming techniques for optimization of transmission policy under replenishment . in @xcite , gatzianas _",
    "_ extend classical wireless network scheduling results to a network with users having rechargeable batteries .",
    "each battery is considered as an energy queue , and data and energy queues are updated simultaneously in an interaction determined by rate versus power relationship .",
    "stability of data queues is studied using lyapunov techniques . in @xcite , in a similar energy harvesting setting , a dynamic power management policy is proposed and is shown to stabilize data queues . in each slot , energy spent is equal to the average recharge rate . moreover , under a linear approximation , some delay - optimal schemes are proposed .",
    "the capacity of scalar awgn channel has been extensively studied in the literature under different constraints on the input signal .",
    "average power ( or the second moment ) constraint on the input yields the well - known result that the capacity achieving input distribution is gaussian with variance equal to the power constraint .",
    "smith @xcite considers amplitude constraints in addition to average power constraints and concludes that the capacity achieving input distribution function is a step function with finite number of increase points .",
    "moreover , shamai and bar - david @xcite extend smith s result to amplitude constrained quadrature gaussian channel for which the optimal input distribution is concentrated to finite number of uniform phase circles within the amplitude constraint .",
    "we consider scalar awgn channel characterized by the input @xmath0 , output @xmath1 , additive noise @xmath2 with unit normal distribution @xmath3 and a battery ( see fig .  [ sys_mod ] ) . input and output alphabets",

    "we assume that the energy stored and depleted from the battery are for only communication purposes ( for example , the energy required for processing is out of the model ) .",
    "existing energy in the battery can be retrieved without any loss and the battery capacity is large enough so that every quanta of incoming energy can be stored in the battery .",
    "this assumption is especially valid for the current state of the technology in which batteries have very large capacities compared to the rate of harvested energy flow @xcite : @xmath11 .",
    "the battery is initially empty and energy needed for communication of a message is obtained from the arriving energy during transmission of the corresponding codeword subject to causality . in particular , @xmath4 units of energy is added to the battery and @xmath12 units of energy is depleted from the battery in the @xmath5th channel use .",
    "this brings us to the following cumulative power constraints on the input based on causality : @xmath13 this is illustrated in fig .",

    "the input constraints in ( [ constraints ] ) are challenging because @xmath4 are random and these constraints introduce memory ( in time ) in the channel inputs .",
    "randomness in @xmath4 makes the problem similar to fading channels in that state of the recharge process ( i.e. , low or high @xmath4 ) affects instantaneous quality of communication .",
    "moreover , this time variation in recharge process allows opportunistic control of energy as in fading channels .",
    "however , recharge process can be collected in battery unlike a fading state .",
    "in fact , we will see that , this nature of energy arrivals makes it more advantageous to save energy in the battery for future use when a peak occurs in the recharge process , as opposed to opportunistically _ ride _ the peaks .",

    "therefore , each codeword satisfying constraints in ( [ constraints ] ) automatically satisfies @xmath31 with probability 1 .",
    "however , if a codeword satisfies average power constraint , it does not necessarily satisfy the constraints in @xmath32 .",
    "hence , we get the following bound : @xmath33 next , we state and prove that the above upper bound can be achieved .",

    "achieving the capacity requires design of an @xmath36 codebook with encoding function @xmath37 and decoding function @xmath38 where @xmath8 is the code length , @xmath39 is the code size and @xmath40 is the probability of error such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "there are two separate causes of error .",
    "the first one is that any codeword does not satisfy the input constraints . in this case",
    ", the encoder does not send that codeword but sends an all zero codeword .",
    "hence , all zero codeword is assumed to be in the codebook and it is decoded to message @xmath43 at the receiver .",
    "if the decoder maps received signal to message @xmath43 , it is accepted as an error .",
    "second cause of error is the actual decoding error at the receiver .",
    "if the received signal is decoded to a message that is different from the message sent , then an error occurs .",
    "accordingly , the error event is defined as union of these two events .    while designing the codebook and the encoding / decoding rule",
    ", a first approach can be to optimize the codebook design subject to the input constraints .",
    "therefore , the occurrence of the first type of error ( i.e. , insufficient energy ) is eliminated from the beginning .",
    "however , we will show that , it is not necessary to solve this difficult optimization problem .",
    "instead , the asymptotic behavior of the constraints allows us to design codes that do not obey the input constraints for a particular @xmath8 with a small probability but the requirement is that small probability goes to zero asymptotically . for the error probability to go to zero , we need to average out the error due to randomness introduced by the channel and due to the randomness in the energy arrivals . to do this",
    ", we propose a scheme that implements a _ save - and - transmit _ principle in that error due to randomness in energy is averaged out first and then the channel coding is performed .",
    "in addition , it is possible to maintain error - free communication even if some code symbols can not be put to the channel correctly .",
    "therefore , we also investigate achievable rates using a _ best - effort - transmit _ scheme , which can interestingly approach @xmath44 neighborhood of the capacity for any @xmath45 .",

    "that is , for @xmath54 , we have , the encoding function , @xmath55 for all @xmath56 . for @xmath57 , @xmath58 comes from realizations of a gaussian distributed random variable of variance @xmath9 for all @xmath56 .    as @xmath8 grows large , by strong law of large numbers , at time index @xmath52 , about @xmath59 amount of energy",
    "is collected in the battery with very high probability . since no energy is consumed up to this time , the codebook is feasible until time @xmath52 .",
    "after time @xmath52 , the probability that a code symbol requires more energy than the energy available in the battery goes to zero and energy consumed is accounted for the energy arrived . in the next @xmath52 channel uses , @xmath59 units of energy is collected in the battery and another @xmath59 is consumed for data transmission .",
    "we repeat this procedure for a total of @xmath60 times , where in each interval of @xmath52 symbols , we collect about @xmath61 units of energy and use about @xmath61 units of energy collected in the previous block of @xmath52 symbols .",
    "the first collected amount guarantees that the codewords are always feasible ( see fig .",
    "[ sys_mod3 ] ) .",
    "more specifically , as the length of the codewords gets large , by strong law of large numbers , we have @xmath62 almost surely for all @xmath63 . for a precise proof of these arguments ,",
    "we need to make use of marcinkiewicz - zygmund type strong laws for sums of i.i.d . random variables",

    "the achievable rate for this scheme is @xmath64 in other words , communication can start with @xmath52 amount of delay and the capacity of a corresponding average power constrained awgn channel can be achieved . since",

    "let @xmath66 be a codeword of length @xmath8 where @xmath14 is the code symbol to be sent in channel use @xmath5 and the codebook be @xmath67 .",
    "the codebook that two parties agree upon is determined by generating independent gaussian distributed random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath68 for each code symbol .",

    ", the code symbol @xmath14 can be put to the channel if @xmath70 .",
    "otherwise , transmitter puts a code symbol @xmath43 to the channel as battery does not have sufficient energy to send symbol @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the input to the channel is @xmath71 and therefore there is a possible mismatch .",
    "yet , we will show in the following that the mismatch does not affect the correct decoding of the message at the receiver .",
    "the battery energy is updated as follows @xmath72 the energy updates in ( [ updates ] ) are analogous to the queue updates in classical slotted systems @xcite where the notion of a slot is replaced with channel use",
    ". therefore , battery acts like an energy queue . unlike in the classical systems with packet queues ,",
    "our aim is to keep the energy queue unstable so that the availability of the energy to send a code symbol is asymptotically guaranteed .",
    "the key to the updates in ( [ updates ] ) is to put @xmath43 symbol on the channel as it guarantees that infeasible code symbols are observed only finitely many times , which is stated in the following theorem , and detailed proof is again skipped for brevity and can be found in @xcite .",
    "[ fmthm ] let @xmath73 be a codeword such that @xmath74 is an i.i.d . real random sequence with mean zero and variance @xmath75 for some @xmath45 sufficiently small .",
    "let @xmath4 be the energy arrivals and @xmath69 be the battery energy which is updated as in ( [ updates ] ) .",
    "then , only finitely many code symbols are infeasible .",
    "it is well known that we can pack about @xmath76 codewords with block length @xmath8 , each having average power less than or equal to @xmath68 , in the @xmath77 space such that , whenever one of them is sent by the transmitter , a joint typicality decoder @xcite which checks whether a codeword is jointly typical with the received signal vector , can reconstruct the codeword at the receiver with probability of error approaching zero . in the _ best - effort - transmit _ scheme",
    ", the received signal vector will still be jointly typical with the sent codeword , since the number of infeasible code symbols is only finitely many due to theorem [ fmthm ] .",
    "hence , the same decoder can recover the codeword if the channel input is @xmath78 in each channel use .",
    "therefore , the code rate @xmath79 is achievable , and hence by continuity of @xmath80 , @xmath81 can be achieved .",
    "we have seen that classical awgn capacity with average power constraint can be achieved with @xmath48 delay for fueling the battery with energy if the recharge process is i.i.d .",
    "however , the recharge process can deviate from its i.i.d .",
    "characteristic in a large time scale .",
    "in particular , the mean value of the recharge process may vary after a long time . in the classical example of sensor nodes fueled with solar power , mean recharge rate changes depending on the time of the day . as an example , the mean recharge rate may vary in one - hour slots and the sensor may be on for twelve hours a day , in which case , a careful management of energy expenditure in each slot will be required to optimize the average performance during the day .",
    "we generalize the system model for @xmath82 large time slots ( see fig .",
    "[ sys_mod4 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the duration of each slot is @xmath83 ( large enough ) . for each slot @xmath84 ,",

    "the causality of energy arrivals requires @xmath92    around @xmath93 bits of data are sent in slot @xmath5 .",
    "before the communication starts , suppose the designer knows the mean recharge rates @xmath85 for all @xmath5 , calculates @xmath86 and adjusts the average power of codewords in slot @xmath5 to @xmath86 during transmission works as well .",
    "this can also be interpreted as a codebook with dynamic power allocation @xcite in slow time variation . ] .",
    "we allocate transmit power to each slot subject to causality constraint so that average throughput in @xmath82 slots is optimized : @xmath94 we will denote the solution of the above optimization problem as @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "note that the slot duration @xmath83 does not appear in the optimization problem .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to characterizing @xmath96 . after developing necessary concepts ,",
    "we present an algorithm to find @xmath96 and illustrate it for several cases .      in order to understand how the optimal solution may look like",
    ", we will first pose the simplest version of the problem .",
    "suppose there is @xmath97 amount of energy available in the battery where @xmath98 is a constant and the recharge process is zero .",
    "then , the optimal power allocation strategy @xmath96 is the one that maximizes @xmath99 subject to @xmath100 . by jensen s inequality @xcite ,",
    "optimal strategy is @xmath101 .",
    "that is , if @xmath102 for @xmath103 , then we can always achieve higher average throughput by setting @xmath104 .",
    "returning to the original problem , above observation translates to a general optimality criterion for the problem , stated in the following theorem",

    "this theorem proposes a method to optimize the power allocation .",
    "it should be performed such that variation in power from slot to slot is avoided as much as possible and the energy should be consumed in as smooth a way as possible .",
    "we will now make this more precise by describing the method of finding the solution @xmath96 .",
    "it is inferred that @xmath96 must take a constant value ( not necessarily the same value ) in each slot .",
