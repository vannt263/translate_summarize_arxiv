    "neutron stars , and more generally , compact stars ( neutron stars , hybrid hadron - quark stars , quark stars ) are the densest stellar objects in the universe . due to their compactness and strong gravity , compact stars can be very fast rotators . in the present paper we limit ourselves to a rigid rotation .",
    "theoretical calculations show that compact stars could rotate at sub - millisecond periods ( i.e. , at frequency @xmath01000 hz : @xcite ) .",
    "the quest for fast rotating compact stars has an interesting history .",
    "the first millisecond pulsar b1937 + 21 , rotating at @xmath1 hz @xcite , remained the most rapid one for 24 years .",
    "in january 2006 , discovery of a faster pulsar j1748 - 2446ad rotating at @xmath2 hz was announced @xcite",
    ". however , sub - khz frequencies are still too low to significantly affect the structure of massive neutron stars with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "actually , pulsars b1937 + 21 and j1748 - 2446ad still rotate in a _ slow rotation _ regime , because their @xmath4 is significantly smaller than the mass shedding ( keplerian ) frequency @xmath5 . in the slow rotation regime",
    "rotational effects in neutron star structure , e.g. , polar flattening , are @xmath6 , and hence not large .",
    "rapid rotation regime for @xmath3 requires sub - millisecond pulsars with supra - khz frequencies ( @xmath7 hz ) .",
    "exciting news came in december 2006 .",
    "@xcite reported a discovery of oscillation frequency @xmath8 hz in an x - ray burst from the x - ray transient , xte j1739 - 285 .",
    "@xcite wrote cautiously `` this oscillation frequency suggests that xte j1739 - 285 contains the fastest rotating neutron star yet found '' .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the first detection of a sub - millisecond pulsar ( discovery of a 0.5 ms pulsar in sn1987a remnant , announced in january 1989 , was withdrawn one year later ) .",
    "fast rotation of compact stars is sensitive to the stellar mass and to the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "hydrostatic , stationary configurations of neutron stars rotating at given rotation frequency @xmath4 form a one - parameter family , labeled by the central density .",
    "this family - a curve in the mass - equatorial radius plane - is limited by two instabilities . on the high central density side",
    ", it is instability with respect to axi - symmetric perturbations , making the star collapse into a kerr black hole .",
    "the low central density boundary results from the mass shedding from the equator . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the dependence of rotation at @xmath7 hz on the poorly known eos , and derive constraints on the eos of neutron stars which could result from future observations of stably rotating sub - millisecond pulsars .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect .  1 we briefly describe eoss used in our calculations .",
    "numerical methods of solving equations of hydrostatic equilibrium of rigidly rotating compact stars in general relativity , and criteria for their stability , are presented in sect .",

    "we are pleased to present our paper on fast rotation of neutron stars in the proceedings of the conference in honor of j .-",
    "lasota . in 1990s",
    "jean - pierre became intrigued by a puzzling precision of `` empirical formula '' for the absolute upper bound on rotation frequency of compact stars , proposed by two of us ( ph and jlz ) on the aftermath of ill fated `` discovery '' of 0.5 ms pulsar in sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "two joint papers resulted from our collaboration @xcite , some progress has been made , but the basic puzzle still remains to be solved .",
    "in view of a high degree of our ignorance of eos of dense matter at supranuclear densities ( @xmath10 ) we considered a broad set of theoretical models .",
    "the set of ten equations of state ( eoss ) considered in the paper is presented in fig .  [",

    "two eoss were chosen to represent a soft ( bpal12 ) and stiff ( gn3 ) extreme cases .",
    "these two extreme eoss should not be considered as `` realistic '' , but they are used just to `` bound '' the models from the soft and the stiff sides .",
    "four eoss are based on realistic models involving only nucleons ( fps , bbb2 , dh , apr ) .",
    "the next four eoss are softened at high density either by the appearance of hyperons ( gnh3 , bgn1h1 ) , or a phase transition ( gmgs - km , gmgs - kp ) .",
    "a softening in the latter case is clearly visible in fig .",

    "however , to get gmgs - kp we assumed that the phase transition takes place between two pure phases and is accompanied by a density jump , calculated using the maxwell construction .",
    "the gmgs - km eos was obtained assuming that the transition occurs via a mixed state of two phases ( gibbs construction ) .",
    "a mixed state is energetically preferred when the surface tension between the two phases is below a certain critical value .",

    "this stability condition sets the bound on our rotating configurations from the right side on @xmath15 plane .",
    "it fixes the largest radius and the smallest central density , allowed for stable stationary configurations .",
    "instability with respect to these oscillations determines the bound for most compact stars , with the smallest radius and the highest central density ( i.e. , from the left side on the @xmath15 plane ) .",

    "it is commonly believed that fast ( millisecond ) pulsars are recycled old neutron stars , spun up to khz frequencies via a long - time disk accretion in lmxbs .",
    "such neutron stars have a weak magnetic field ( @xmath39 g ) , which does not affect the accretion flow .",

    "specific angular momentum per unit baryon mass of a matter element orbiting the neutron star at the isco , @xmath40 , is calculated by solving exact equations of the orbital motion of a particle in the space - time produced by a rotating neutron star ( appendix a of @xcite ) .",

    ", one has to start with a non - rotating neutron star located in the segment cd ( if @xmath48 ) , or ab ( if @xmath49 ) . as one can see , there are bounds on the initial mass of a non - rotating star , which can be spun - up to a given frequency @xmath52 via disk accretion . for @xmath47  hz @xmath48 the allowed mass range for initial non - rotating star is @xmath53 .    .",

    "triangular region near the center ( cyan ) is obtained for @xmath48 .",
    "the non - shaded region on the right , composed of a tilted triangle and a lentil - like upper determines the range of allowable masses of final configurations rotating at a given frequency . ]    in fig [ fig : fmacc ] we plotted , for the dh eos , the bounds on the initial mass of a non - rotating neutron star , for which the spin - up via accretion could reach a required rotation frequency .",
    "results are presented for two values of @xmath45 .",
    "shaded areas correspond to the allowed a range of initial masses of non - rotating star .",
    "left `` triangle '' was obtained for @xmath49 , while the central shaded `` triangle '' ( with points c and d ) - for @xmath48 .",
    "the limits on the actual mass of rotating ns which was formed by disk accretion onto an initial static star are given by the three curves on the right in fig .",

    "these curves pass by three points e , f , and g in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr1400 ] .",
    "the curve passing by the point e ( green ) is the bound resulting from the keplerian limit of a rotating star .",
    "the ( magenta ) line passing by the point f is the boundary resulting from the instability with respect to axi - symmetric perturbations . finally , curve passing through the point g is a locus of maxima on the mass - radius curve at a fixed final rotation frequency : point g is obtained for 1400 hz .",
    "as the frequency of the final configuration increases , the mass at the keplerian limit increases more rapidly , than that defined by the onset of the axi - symmetric instability at the maximum mass ( at 1400 hz : points f and g , respectively ) .",
    "for very high frequencies the maximum mass of the stars rotating at a fixed frequency is given by the value for keplerian limit .",
    "in the considered case of the dh eos , the point g disappears at frequency @xmath54  hz ( point @xmath55 ) . for faster rotation",
    "the curve @xmath21 is monotonous ( no maximum between the both ends ) .",
    "however , the range of masses of stars rotating at so high frequency is very narrow . for @xmath56",
    "hz it is smaller than @xmath57 ( see also discussion of fig.[fig : mrsubms ] in sect .  [",
    "sect : sub - ms ] ) .",
    "let us summarize main results reported in the present paper , and obtained using a large set of theoretical eoss .",
    "the @xmath21 curve for @xmath58  hz ( rotation period @xmath59ms ) is flat .",
    "therefore , at such frequencies , for any given eos the mass of a stably rotating compact star is quite well defined .",
    "conversely , a measured mass of a compact star rotating at @xmath58 hz will allow us to unveil the actual eos of dense matter .",
    "the `` newtonian '' formula for the keplerian frequency reproduces surprisingly well precise 2-d simulations and sets a firm upper limit on @xmath60 for a given @xmath4 .",
    "finally , observation of @xmath61 hz sets stringent limits on the initial mass of a non - rotating star which was spun up to this frequency via accretion from a disk .    in the present paper we limited ourselves to _ hadronic stars _",
    ", built exclusively or predominantly of hadrons .",
    "we did not discuss our results obtained for hypothetical compact stars built of a self - bound quark matter , called _ quark stars _ or _",
    "strange stars_. some of results for quark stars with and without crust were briefly reported in ref.@xcite . generally , most of general features and relations obtained for hadronic stars hold also for quark stars . however , is some cases one notices systematic difference between rapidly rotating hadronic and quark stars .",
