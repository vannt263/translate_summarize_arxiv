    "phosphorus , an extraordinary element in the group 5a of the periodic table , exists in different allotropic modifications including white , black and amorphous red at ambient conditions.@xcite among these allotropic forms black phosphorus is the most stable one.@xcite it is a semiconductor@xcite that crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure.@xcite at ambient conditions , orthorhombic black phosphorus has a puckered layered structure where each phosphorus atom is covalently bonded with three neighboring phosphorus atoms in the same layer , the layers being weakly coupled by van der waals ( vdw ) forces . at high pressures orthorhombic black phosphorus transforms to a rhombohedral structure around 5 gpa , and transforms further on to a simple cubic structure at 10 gpa.@xcite at very high pressures of 137 gpa and 262 gpa , further structural phase transitions have been studied by akahama et al.@xcite using x - ray diffraction .",
    "the measurements of the physical properties of black phosphorus such as the anisotropic electrical resistivity@xcite and the optical reflectance have been reported,@xcite as have been angle resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectra,@xcite infrared absorption spectra,@xcite and phonon dispersions obtained by inelastic neutron scattering.@xcite    on the theoretical side , investigations of the electronic structure@xcite using the linear muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) method,@xcite and optical properties using the self consistent pseudopotential method were published.@xcite lattice dynamical properties of black phosphorus including phonon dispersion relations were obtained@xcite using a valence force field method .",
    "a number of studies discuss the high - pressure behavior of black phosphorus , notably the structural stability and the electronic structure.@xcite recently , du et al.@xcite performed calculations for single layered and bulk black phosphorus and reported that black phosphorus may be used as anode material for lithium ion batteries .    since black phosphorus is a layered structure material that binds through van der waals interactions between the layers it is necessary to include the vdw interactions in the theoretical calculations of the ground state structural properties of this system .",
    "van der waals forces , or dispersive forces , result from the interaction between fluctuating multipoles without the need of an overlap of the electron densities . the standard density functional theory ( dft ) functionals such as the local density approximation ( lda ) , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , and various hybrid functionals do not describe properly the vdw forces , which are non - local in nature . to overcome this difficulty , we have used dispersion corrected density - functional theory ( dft - d ) approaches , which enhance the total - energy functional by a damped@xcite interatomic pairwise potential energy of the form c@xmath6r@xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the interatomic distance .",
    "the main focus of the present work is to calculate the ground state structural and dynamical properties of black phosphorus , and to compare several schemes for inclusion of vdw interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the next section presents the computational methods used , and the results and discussions are presented in section iii . the last section , iv , contains a summary .",
    "the calculations were performed using the cambridge series of total energy package ( castep)@xcite code based on dft using vanderbilt - type ultra soft pseudo potentials@xcite for the electron - ion interactions .",
    "the exchange - correlational potential of ceperley and alder@xcite as parameterized by perdew and zunger@xcite(capz ) in lda , and the gga schemes of perdew and wang@xcite ( pw91 ) and of perdew - burke - ernzerhof@xcite ( pbe ) were used .",
    "different dft - d approaches to treat vdw interactions were employed , notably the ortmann , bechstedt and schmidt@xcite ( obs ) correction to pw91 , as well as the tkatchenko and scheffler@xcite ( ts ) and grimme@xcite corrections to pbe . in the three methods , a correction of the form @xmath9",
    "is added to the dft total energy for each pair @xmath10 of atoms separated by a distance @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is a damping function which is necessary to avoid divergence for small values of @xmath8 , and @xmath13 is the dispersion coefficient for the atom pair @xmath10 .",
    "the three methods use a slightly different damping function ( see refs . , and for details ) , but while the @xmath13 coefficients in the grimme and obs methods depend only on the chemical species , the ts method calculate them for every structure by using the fact that the polarisability depends on the volume ( see ref . ) . in the present study , we did not attempt to tweak the various coefficients of the different methods and kept them as in the original publications . in particular , in black phosphorus enters only one @xmath14 coefficient , for the p - p interaction , with values of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ev@xmath18@xmath19 in the obs , grimme and ts ( unscaled ) approaches , respectively .",
    "these methods have shown to be realiable and are often used for electronic structure calculations .",
    "for instance , grimme s method has been used recently to study the binding properties of various solids@xcite and the structure and dynamics of molecular spin crossover compounds.@xcite the obs method is also widely used , as exemplified by the study@xcite of the interaction between no@xmath20 molecules and the au-111 surface .",
    "the method of tkatchenko and scheffler is also very popular and was used recently to study the hydrogen bonds of ice under pressure@xcite and the interlayer sliding energy landscape of hexagonal boron nitride.@xcite    to perform our calculations , a plane wave cut - off energy of 520 ev is used and the first brillouin zone of the unit cell is sampled according to the monkhorst - pack scheme,@xcite by means of a ( 9x6x8 ) k - point sampling .",
    "the pulay@xcite density mixing scheme was applied for the electron energy minimization process . during the structural optimization process iterations",
    "were continued until the change in total energy was less than @xmath21 ev / atom and the maximum displacement of atoms less than @xmath22  .",
    "the elastic constants are calculated using the volume - conserving strain technique as implemented in the castep code.@xcite    at ambient conditions black phosphorus crystallizes in a base centered orthorhombic structure ( see fig .",
    "1 ) with the space group of c__mca _ _ ( no . 64 ) .",
    "the experimental lattice parameters@xcite are @xmath23  , @xmath24   and @xmath25  .",
    "the crystal structure consists of puckered layers of p atoms with three short covalent bonds ( two at 2.22  , and one at 2.28  ) , with vdw bonding along the @xmath0-axis , the vertical distance between layers being 3.27  .",
    "the orthorhombic unit cell contains 8 phosphorus atoms in the crystallographic ( @xmath26 ) positions@xcite @xmath27 .",
    "the nearest and next - nearest atomic separations between the layers ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 in fig . 1 ) are 3.6   and 3.8  .    in the orthorhombic crystal structure",
    "there are nine independent elastic constants@xcite : c@xmath2 , c@xmath1 , c@xmath3 , c@xmath30 , c@xmath31 , c@xmath32 , c@xmath33 , c@xmath34 , c@xmath35 . here",
    ", we follow the conventions of the experimental works@xcite in which the indices @xmath36 are defined to correspond to the crystallographic directions @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , respectively , as indicated in fig . 1 . to calculate the elastic constants ,",
    "the equilibrium crystal structure is deformed by the appropriate strain and the variation in total energy gives the elastic constants .",
    "this is explained in detail for orthorhombic crystals in ref . .",
    "the phosphorus internal coordinates @xmath39 and @xmath40 are freely varied during these deformations .",
    "the theoretical equilibrium crystal structure was obtained by full structural optimization including lattice constants and the internal coordinates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , using lda , gga , and the three considered versions of gga - d .",
    "the calculated structural parameters are presented in table i. taking the experimental ambient volume as reference , we find the difference between calculated and experimental volume of -11 % with lda , + 8 % with pw91 , and + 10 % with pbe .",
    "the large errors reflect that none of these approximations to the exchange - correlation potential are able to capture correctly the nature of the interactions in black phosphorus .",
    "the dft - d schemes perform much better ( see table i ) , the errors in predicted equilibrium volumes being only + 1.5 % , + 2.9 % , and -0.3 % , respectively , for the pw91-obs , pbe - ts , and pbe - grimme parametrizations . considering the three lattice parameters ,",
    "it is clear that the largest error is found for the @xmath0-parameter , the characteristic dimension in the z - direction , i.e. perpendicular to the covalent p layers .",
    "thus , the interlayer interaction is dominated by dispersive forces ( vdw ) , and an accurate description of this type of interaction is important .",
    "comparison of the data for gga - pbe and gga - pbe - grimme in table i shows that the inclusion of vdw interaction reduces the @xmath5-parameter by @xmath41 % , while the @xmath0-parameter is reduced by @xmath42 % . on the other hand ,",
    "the internal parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 are about equally well predicted by all functionals considered , probably because these parameters are determined by the p - p covalent bonds , which are usually well described by lda and gga .",
    "the overall best agreement with experimental parameters is achieved with the pbe - grimme functional .",
    "our lda calculations are in reasonable agreement with the lda calculations performed by ahuja@xcite ( see table i ) .",
    "the minor differences are most likely due to the different parametrizations of the lda functional used and to the different basis sets ( plane waves in the present work versus full potential lmto in ref . ) .     and @xmath29 ) .",
    "]    .the calculated ground state properties of orthorhombic black phosphorus at ambient pressure .",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath5 are the lattice parameters , @xmath43 the volume of the orthorhombic unit cell , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 the internal crystallographic parameters .",
    "capz denotes the lda parametrization of refs . ,",

    "also included are the results of the lda calculations by ahuja@xcite with the hedin - lundqvist parametrization ( lda - hl)@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      black phosphorus transforms under pressure from the orthorhombic structure ( @xmath4417 ) to a rhombohedral structure ( @xmath447 ) at roughly @xmath45 gpa.@xcite this transition was studied previously by schiferl@xcite using an empirical local pseudopotential , and was analysed by burdett et al.@xcite using the concept of orbital symmetry conservation . chang and cohen@xcite performed calculations using the pseudopotential method within the local density approximation .",
    "however , they found it necessary to apply a shift ( of 2.3 mry per p atom ) to their calculated total energy of the @xmath447 phase in order to reproduce the experimental value of the transition pressure , which is pointing out the inadequacy of the lda to describe correctly the energetics of black phosphorus .",
    "this is in contradiction with the results of ahuja@xcite who obtained a transition pressure of @xmath46= 4.5 gpa using the lmto method and lda . in the present work we also studied the transition pressure using grimme s vdw functional",
    "this leads to a value of @xmath47 gpa , implying that although the grimme functional is correctly ranking the @xmath4417 structure versus the @xmath447 structure in terms of the total energy at @xmath48 gpa , the transition happens at a too low pressure in the calculation compared to the experimental pressure .",
    "similar calculations were carried out using either of the pw91 , pbe , obs or ts functionals , but in all cases the transition pressure is found to be too low , within a 1 gpa range around the value obtained with the grimme functional .    possibly , a better agreement with the experimental transition pressure could be obtained using a more advanced description of the van der waals interactions , such as the adiabatic - connection fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite in the random phase approximation or quantum monte - carlo@xcite method .",
    "however , these methods are numerically heavier than the simple dipole - dipole corrections considered here , and to our knowledge the implementation of the corresponding forces necessary to perform the structural relaxation under pressure is not available .",
    "the optical phonons of black phosphorus have been obtained by the linear response method within density functional perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite in this method the force - constant matrix is obtained by differentiation of the hellmann - feynman forces on atoms with respect to the ionic coordinates . in order to understand the optical phonons of black phosphorus ,",
    "it is necessary to first consider the dynamical properties of this structure .",
    "the primitive cell contains four atoms leading to 12 vibrational modes , i. e. 9 optical and 3 acoustic phonons branches . from the group theoretical analysis of the c__mca _ _ space group , the irreducible representation at the brillouin zone center is @xmath49 and @xmath50    all the optical phonons are raman active except the @xmath51 and @xmath52 modes , which are infrared active , and the @xmath53 mode , which is silent .",
    "the optical phonons of black phosphorus were investigated by sugai and shirotani@xcite and by akahama et al.@xcite the raman frequencies turn out to be relatively insensitive to the details of the functional employed , for which reason we show the results obtained with the gga - grimme fuctional .",
    "this is probably a reflection of the fact that the optical phonons are described by near - neighbour interatomic forces , which are dominated by covalent interactions , which are generally well accounted for by the lda .",
    "the eigenvectors of the raman modes , as calculated at ambient pressure within the gga - grimme approach are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_modes ] , in good agreement with earlier work.@xcite from the calculated raman eigen - modes , the @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 modes are seen to constitute inter - layer vibrations with a strong component along the @xmath0 direction . in the modes @xmath57 and @xmath58 the atoms move along the @xmath4 direction , while in the @xmath59 mode the atoms move along the @xmath5 direction .",
    "ref . studied the pressure variation of the raman shifts . in fig .",
    "[ fig_raman ] the calculated raman frequencies under pressure up to 5 gpa are compared with these experimental results .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent .",
    "the strongest pressure dependence is seen for the inter - layer @xmath54 mode , for which the pressure coefficient is @xmath60 @xmath61/gpa in theory , and @xmath62 @xmath61/gpa according to experiment.@xcite     +     ]",
    "first - principles calculations based on the dft have been used to investigate the structural properties of black phosphorus within lda and gga .",
    "it was found that the calculated material parameters differ significantly from the experimental data , while including empirical methods to account for van der waals interactions ( dft - d ) leads to structural properties in good agreement with experiments .",
    "this demonstrates that van der waals interactions play a major role in black phosphorus . among the obs , ts and grimme parametrizations of van der waals interactions , the calculated structural parameters are in closest agreement with experimental data when pbe - grimme is used",
    "also , the influence of external pressure on the lattice parameters were calculated .",
    "the @xmath0 lattice parameter was found to be most sensitive to which vdw functional was used , reflecting the dominance of van der waals interactions along the crystallographic @xmath0-direction .",
    "further , the elastic properties of single crystal as well as polycrystalline black phosphorus were examined using the gga - pbe - grimme functional .",
    "our calculations confirm that black phosphorus is a mechanically stable anisotropic material , and that the system is stiffest along the @xmath4-axis .",
    "the calculated shear anisotropy factors for different directions indicate strong anisotropies for shears perpendicular to the @xmath4 and @xmath0 axes .",
    "the polycrystalline bulk , shear and young s moduli , as well as poisson s ratio were calculated . from the ratio of bulk to shear modulus ,",
