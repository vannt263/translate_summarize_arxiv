    "nonlinear interference effects , based on atomic coherence @xcite , have attracted in the past decade a growing attention .",
    "they have found numerous applications in nonlinear optics @xcite - @xcite , nonlinear high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite - @xcite , high - precision metrology ( atomic clocks and magnetometers ) @xcite - @xcite , laser cooling @xcite , atom optics and interferometry @xcite - @xcite , and quantum information processing @xcite - @xcite .",
    "to date the most investigated phenomenon is electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . as a matter of fact , eit means a broad array of nonlinear effects in which the absorption is significantly reduced due to nonlinear interference of electromagnetic waves .",
    "in particular , in certain atomic systems eit is related to dark states and coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite .    the opposite phenomenon of electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia ) , first observed by akulshin et al . in 1998 @xcite , is much less studied .",
    "after 1998 several groups have performed experiments on observations of eia and related effects in different atomic systems and under different conditions @xcite - @xcite .",
    "both two - photon resonances in a bichromatic light field and magneto - optical resonances in the hanle configuration have been explored .",
    "the first theoretical explanation of physical origins of eia was given in @xcite , where , using a simple analytically tractable model of a four - level @xmath1-system as an example , we have shown that eia is due to the transfer of low - frequency atomic coherence between interacting levels in the course of spontaneous radiative transitions . subsequently , this concept has been confirmed in experiments and by numerical calculations @xcite , and it has been further developed in @xcite . summarizing and generalizing , we can say that eia can be observed on resonant atomic transitions of @xmath2 type with degenerate ground state ( @xmath3 ) , and its physical origin is the spontaneous transfer of the light - induced anisotropy ( atomic coherence or / and population difference ) . as the result",
    ", under two - photon resonance conditions atoms mainly populate zeeman sub - states most coupled to the light field .",
    "if the spontaneous transfer of anisotropy is absent , i.e. , the ground state is repopulated isotropically , atomic populations are distributed inversely proportional to the optical depopulation rates , which leads to the eit - type resonances .",
    "it is worth to note that the same physical reason ( the spontaneous transfer of anisotropy ) is responsible for the `` anomalous '' sign of nonlinear magneto - optical rotation of linearly polarized light on @xmath4 transitions .",
    "this effect has been observed earlier in 1990 @xcite , and its theoretical explanation has been given by kanorsky et al .",
    "@xcite on the base of the perturbation theory method developed in @xcite .",
    "the difference in signs of the ground - state quadrupole moments , which govern the sign of nonlinear magneto - optical rotation , for transitions @xmath4 from one hand , and for @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions from the other hand has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a detailed theoretical study of eia / eit magneto - optical resonances in the hanle configuration .",
    "we explore the realistic but analytically solvable model of a @xmath7 atomic transition .",
    "note that this transition is the simplest transition ( from the @xmath8 class ) , where the light - induced quadrupole moment , precessing in a magnetic field orthogonal to the polarization ellipse plane , can appear in the ground state .",
    "apart from the radiative relaxation , the excited - state depolarization due to collisions with a buffer gas is taken into account , which allows us to consider a gradual transition from eia to eit with the increase of the depolarization rate .",
    "it should be noted , in the majority of works on the magneto - optical variant of eia / eit resonance , except for the papers @xcite - @xcite , the linearly polarized radiation was used or considered .",
    "here we investigate a general case of the resonance interaction of atoms with elliptically polarized light .",
    "we find several new features of the magneto - optical spectra connected with the light ellipticity .",
    "the treatment is carried out for atoms at rest ( homogeneous broadening ) as well as for atomic gas under conditions of the doppler broadening .",
    "the role of the finite atom - light interaction time is briefly discussed .",
    "we consider the resonance interaction of atoms , having the total angular momenta @xmath9 in the ground state and @xmath10 in the excited state , with a monochromatic light field @xmath11 in the presence of a static magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "more specifically , the field configuration is an elliptically polarized running wave : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the complex amplitude , and @xmath15 is the unit polarization vector . in the coordinate frame",
    "associated with the wave ( @xmath16 is directed along @xmath17 , @xmath18  along the polarization ellipse semiaxes ) the polarization vector can be written as @xmath19 with @xmath20 the corresponding spherical orths , and @xmath21 equal to the ratio of the ellipse semiaxes ( see in fig .  [",
    "scheme].a ) .",
    "the atom - light interaction hamiltonian in the dipole and in the rotating - wave approximations has the form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the coupling constant ( rabi frequency ) , and , according to the wigner - eckart theorem , @xmath24 with the wigner vector operator defined through clebsch - gordan coefficients : @xmath25 the indices @xmath26 and @xmath27 can take values @xmath28 .",
    "the interaction with a weak static field @xmath12 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath29 where the operator @xmath30 are the projection of the total angular momentum operator of the level @xmath31 on the direction @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the zeeman splitting between adjacent substates of the level @xmath31 with @xmath34 the bohr magneton and @xmath35 the lande @xmath36-factor ; @xmath37 is a unit vector directed along the magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "all operators are represented as matrices on the zeeman basis of the ground and excited levels , with states @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the atomic density matrix @xmath40 can be separated in four matrix blocks , where the matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the density submatrices for the ground and excited state , and the off - diagonal blocks @xmath43 and @xmath44 describe the optical coherences . in the rotating - wave approximation",

    "the operator @xmath59 in the right - hand side of eq.([gg ] ) corresponds to the repopulation of the ground state due to the spontaneous radiative transitions .",

    "one can see that for elliptically polarized light the resonance width is significantly less than in the case of linear polarization .",

    "is obtained . in the low - saturation limit , when the resonance width is much less than the natural width , the lineshape is a generalized lorentzian .",
    "it is shown that in the case of linearly polarized filed ( @xmath119 ) or in the exact resonance ( @xmath150 ) the lineshape is symmetric , and the resonance sign is governed by the rate of the excited - state collisional depolarization @xmath71 . with an increase of @xmath71",
