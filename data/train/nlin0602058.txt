    "the search for solitary waves is a mandatory topic in a huge number of branches of non - linear science .",
    "the reason for this lies in the fact that the method of linearizing nonlinear differential equations omits phenomena of essential importance in many different physical problems .",
    "the non - linear klein - gordon system of coupled pde equations , generalized to @xmath0-real scalar fields , reads : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is a differentiable potential function of the scalar fields @xmath3 , whereas @xmath4 are non - linear functions of the fields .",
    "it is clear that this system is invariant under poincare transformations .",
    "for this reason we shall use a system of units where the speed of light is set to one : @xmath5 .",
    "also , due to the potential applications of the pde system ( [ eq : nlkg ] ) in quantum physics we shall implicitly understand @xmath6 , i.e. , we shall work in the natural system of units .",
    "we shall focus on physical systems governed by the pde system ( [ eq : nlkg ] ) in only one spatial dimension .",
    "the paradigm with only one real scalar field is the celebrated sine - gordon equation : @xmath7 arising in differential geometry in the theory of negative curvature surfaces , the sine - gordon equation is ubiquitous in the description of one - dimensional physical phenomena . to mention a few ,",
    "1 ) it is the evolution equation for the amplitude of various slowly varying waves , 2 ) it describes the propagation of a dislocation in a crystal , 3 ) it provides a model for elementary particles moving on a line , 4 ) it rules the propagation of magnetic flux in a long josephson - junction transmission line , 5 ) it determines the modulation of a weakly unstable baroclinic wave packet in a two - layer fluid , etcetera , see , e.g. , reference @xcite .    point 3 ) deserves special mention and will be the arena within we shall analyze the generalized non - linear klein - gordon pde system proposed in this paper .",
    "the similarities between the properties of solitary waves ( or solitons ) and elementary particles are clear .",
    "the field energy density of a non - linear wave ( solitary wave or soliton ) is localized in a lump . moreover , being non - dispersive , solitary waves ( or solitons ) propagate without changes in shape .",
    "after collisions , solitary waves almost keep their structure , leaving some radiation in the form of dispersive waves as remnants .",
    "solitons , however , only suffer phase shifts under collisions . in soliton - antisoliton scattering , either both solitary waves may be annihilated or , alternatively , they may form a bound ( breather ) state .",
    "elementary particles share all of these properties .",
    "thus , if an appropriate system of non - linear field equations admits solitary waves ( or solitons ) as solutions , these non - dispersive waves behave almost as elementary particles .",
    "nevertheless , the main feature of these solutions , the confinement of the energy density , has straightforward implementation in many areas . in condensed matter",
    ", these solutions describe interfaces in magnetic materials @xcite and in ferroelectric crystals @xcite .",
    "they have also been used to understand some bizarre properties of the poly(oxyethylene ) @xcite , widely studied owing to its biotechnical and biomedical applications @xcite . among the impressive features of this polymer",
    ", we can mention the ability to entrap metallic ions in aqueous solution and its solubility in water to almost any extent . on the other hand , in cosmology",
    "solitary waves are interpreted as domain walls which seeded the formation of structures in the early universe @xcite .",
    "they are also of direct interest in high energy physics , for instance , describing gravity in warped spacetimes involving @xmath8 extra spatial dimensions @xcite , or the coupling of scalar matter fields with dilaton gravity @xcite , which seems to be related to the formation and evaporation of black holes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when these defects appear as bps states in both extended supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite and string / m theory @xcite they play a crucial rle in the understanding of dualities between the different regimes of the system . in this framework",
    ", they behave as extended states in @xmath9 susy gluodynamics and the wess - zumino model @xcite .",
    "the structure of the solitary waves that we are going to unveil in this paper is richer than the usual kink structure found in simpler models .",
    "thus , our topological defects could describe more subtle effects in each of all these scenarios .    in general , the above mentioned systems",
    "involve a high number of fields . in order to investigate the presence of solitary waves or topological defects , the usual procedure is to obtain an effective scalar field theory , carrying out severe restrictions on the original theory . in most cases one",
    "is compelled to pursue an effective theory that corresponds to a single scalar field model , where the existence of topological defects can be checked easily . in general , however , the effective theory depends on several scalar fields , and the truncation can involve a important loss of information about the presence of solitary waves or topological defects .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to investigate the general properties of solitary waves in a multi - scalar field theory",
    ". this is an important qualitative step as reported by rajaraman @xcite : _ this already brings us to the stage where no general methods are available for obtaining all localized static solutions , given the field equations .",
    "however , some solutions , but by no means all , can be obtained for a class of such lagrangians using a little trial and error_.    some work on two - component scalar field theory models equipped with a minkowskian space - time has been accomplished , see for instance references @xcite . in some of these models , two - parametric families of solitary waves or kinks",
    "are identified .",
    "generally , each member of these families is a composite solitary wave , which involves several lumps , i.e , the energy density is localized at several points .",
    "the parameters identifying each solution correspond to a translational parameter , @xmath10 , which determines the center of the kink , and an orbit \" parameter @xmath11 , which specifies the separation between the lumps .",
    "study of manton s adiabatic motion of solitary waves @xcite is very simple in this case because the geometric metric of the moduli ( parameter ) space that governs the dynamics does not depend on the translational parameter @xmath10 ; thus , it is always possible to apply a transformation that leads to an euclidean metric . on the other hand , there are only a few works that have addressed research into solitary waves in three - component scalar field theory models , see @xcite . in this richer case",
    "there are three - parametric families of kinks , and the adiabatic evolution of three - body lumps is associated with metrics with curvature .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of , in this case , three - body solitary waves is therefore much more intricate .    in a slightly different physical context , where the solitary waves are understood as domain walls ( 2-branes ) in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions models with three scalar fields have been discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "considering topological defects ( 0-branes ) in more spatial dimensions ( p - branes ) allows for complex structures having defects nested inside defects .",
    "it is plausible that the composite solitary waves to be discussed in this paper will give rise to even richer structures of nested defects inside defects if considered in more dimensions .",
    "an interesting work is also available on networks of topological defects in a model with two complex scalar fields , see @xcite .",
    "the potential energy density is a polynomial in the fields of arbitrary order chosen in such a way that the model enjoys a @xmath12 symmetry , networks of domain walls arising in the surface of @xmath13-balls .",
    "in other direction , defects inside defects in models with two scalar fields have been considered before , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "very recently , networks of topological defects arising in a model with @xmath14 scalar fields in nine spatial dimensions have been studied in @xcite and the evolution of these ( or similar ) structures has been analyzed in @xcite .    in this paper , we shall address a three - component scalar field model that generalizes the two - component model discussed in reference @xcite to three fields .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce the model and describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern as well as the spectrum of dispersive waves . in section 3",
    "we describe the variety of solitary ( non - dispersive ) waves that arises in this system .",
    "we classify these solutions according to the number of lumps they are made of .",
    "there are three basic solitary waves with the energy density confined in one finite region .",
    "the rest of the solutions are composite and display several lumps the energy density is localized at various points.",
    "we shall deal with a three - component scalar field theory model defined in a ( 1 + 1 ) minkowskian space - time .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the action functional : @xmath16 \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] and the potential term is the following sixth - degree polynomial in the fields : @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the non - dimensional coupling constants of the system , chosen , without loss of generality , such that @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , are dimensionless scalar fields , @xmath23 our convention for the metric tensor components in minkowski space @xmath24 is : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this model is a @xmath27 deformation of the same system with @xmath28-invariant potential energy density : @xmath29 besides the poincare transformations acting on @xmath24 , the non - deformed model -@xmath30- is invariant under @xmath31 rotations in internal space @xmath32 .",
    "the specific form of @xmath33 , however , shows spontaneous symmetry breaking of the internal symmetry to a @xmath34 subgroup so that two goldstone bosons are unavoidable if the asymmetric vacuum -any point at a distance 1 from the origin in @xmath32- is chosen to perform the quantization of the system ; the set of zeroes of @xmath33 is the the union of a discrete point , the origin , and a continuous manifold , the 2-sphere of radius 1 in @xmath32 .",
    "coleman proved in @xcite that there are no goldstone bosons on the line in a sensible physical system .",
    "the infrared asymptotic behavior of the quantum system would require modification of the potential @xmath33 in such a way that the zeroes of the potential become a discrete set and massless particles are forbidden .",
    "our deformation complies with this requirement and could be understood as being generated by infrared quantum fluctuations .",
    "the added terms in the potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) explicitly break the @xmath31 symmetry to the discrete subgroup @xmath35 , generated by the reflections @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in internal space .",
    "we also stress that the present system is a generalization of the two - component scalar field theory model discussed in reference @xcite , where the dimension of the internal space , the number of scalar fields , is increased by one unit .",
    "the field equations form the system of coupled second - order partial differential equations : @xmath39 \\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_2}{\\partial t^2}-\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_2}{\\partial x^2}&=&2\\phi_2\\left[3 ( \\phi_1 ^ 2+\\phi_2 ^ 2+\\phi_3 ^ 2)^2 -2 ( 2-\\sigma_2 ^ 2 ) \\phi_1 ^ 2 -4 \\bar\\sigma_2 ^ 2 \\phi_2 ^ 2 -2 ( \\bar\\sigma_2 ^ 2+\\bar\\sigma_3 ^ 2 ) \\phi_3 ^ 2 + \\bar\\sigma_2 ^ 4\\right ] \\label{eq : partial}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_3}{\\partial t^2}-\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_3}{\\partial x^2}&=&2\\phi_3\\left[3 ( \\phi_1 ^ 2+\\phi_2 ^ 2+\\phi_3 ^ 2)^2 -2 ( 2-\\sigma_3 ^ 2 ) \\phi_1 ^ 2 - 2 ( \\bar\\sigma_2 ^ 2+\\bar\\sigma_3 ^ 2 ) \\phi_2 ^ 2 -4 \\bar\\sigma_3 ^ 2 \\phi_3 ^ 2 + \\bar\\sigma_3 ^ 4\\right ] \\nonumber \\qquad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the sake of simplicity , henceforth we use the notation : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "a point \" in the configuration space of the system is a configuration of the field of finite energy ; i.e. , a picture of the field at a fixed time such that the energy @xmath45 , the integral over the line of the energy density , @xmath46=\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx { \\cal e}[\\vec\\phi]\\qquad , \\qquad { \\cal e}[\\vec{\\phi}]=\\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{d\\phi_1}{d x } \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{d\\phi_2}{d x } \\right)^2+\\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{d\\phi_3}{d x } \\right)^2+v(\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\phi_3 ) \\qquad , \\label{eq : density}\\ ] ] is finite .",

    "the zeroes of the potential energy density ( [ eq : vac ] ) are also homogeneous static solutions of the field equations ( [ eq : partial ] ) with zero energy ; in fact , they are absolute minima of the energy in the topological sectors @xmath81 .",
    "a spontaneous symmetry breaking arises because of the degeneracy of the set @xmath51 .",
    "whereas the point @xmath82 located in the origin preserves the discrete symmetry @xmath83 of the lagrangian , the choice of @xmath84 breaks the symmetry generated by the reflection @xmath85 , which connects the two points , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , to the little group @xmath88 .",
    "similar considerations work for the pair of points @xmath89 and @xmath90 with respect to the transformations @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "the energy of these six - body solitary waves does not depend on the coupling constants : @xmath309= e(k_1^{cd } ) +   e[k_3^{do}(0,0 ) ] +   e[k_2^{oc}(0)]= 2 e(k_1^{cd } ) + 2 e(k_1^{ob})+ 2 e(k_1^{bc})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\qquad .\\ ] ]      _ 2 .",
    "@xmath310 : _ another one - parametric family of six - body solitary waves exists in the @xmath311 topological sectors , now located on the plane @xmath57 . also ,",
    "the restricted potential energy , @xmath312 corresponds to a two - component scalar field model studied in @xcite .",
    "there is one difference in this three - component situation : as in the previous case , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) reduces to either the i ) @xmath313 or ii ) @xmath314 faces of @xmath122 : @xmath315 again , the hamilton - jacobi equations for @xmath302 and @xmath303 must be solved consecutively and the two pieces must be continuously glued afterwards .",
    "the choice of sign combinations for @xmath316 , @xmath305 , @xmath306 is opposite to that giving the @xmath260 kinks .",
    "these solutions asymptotically join the points @xmath317 and @xmath318 crossing the foci @xmath130 .",
    "the kink form factors are : @xmath319 in figure 14(a ) a @xmath310 kink is depicted with @xmath202 that connects the point @xmath287 with @xmath157 .",
    "the structure of one member of this family is similar to that found for the previous kinks . from the energy density plot shown in figure 14(b ) , one sees that each member of the family consists of six basic particles : two @xmath161 , two @xmath148 and two @xmath173 kinks .",
    "only the order differs ( the two - body kink is on the right of the three - body lump ) and the two - body kink is made of a @xmath161 and a @xmath173 solitary wave , instead of a @xmath148 and a @xmath173 .",
    "the energy , however , is the same : @xmath320        _ 2 .",
    "@xmath321 : _ besides the generic ( depending on two parameters ) @xmath232 kinks , there are other generic solitary waves . other combinations of signs in the system of equations ( [ eq : nu3 ] ) provide new generic kinks different from @xmath232 .",
    "the kink orbits of these solutions run between the @xmath175 and @xmath176 minima tracing a curve with three well - defined stages : 1 ) first , the kink trajectory departs from the point @xmath176 at @xmath178 remaining in a octant of the ellipsoid @xmath55 interior until the particle reaches a point of the characteristic hyperbola @xmath322 . during this stage",
    "the trajectory satisfies the system of equations ( [ eq : nu3 ] ) with @xmath323 .",
    "2 ) then , the kink orbit crosses to the next octant ( from left to right or viceversa ) through this point and traces a curve that ends by hitting a point in the characteristic ellipse @xmath324 . in this second stage",
    "the kink trajectory also complies with ( [ eq : nu3 ] ) but the sign combination is @xmath325 .",
    "3 ) the last stage of the kink trajectory starts again by changing the octant ( from up to down or viceversa ) through the point in @xmath324 .",
    "the kink orbit runs along a curve in the latter octant until the point @xmath175 is reached .",
    "the final stage satisfies the system ( [ eq : nu3 ] ) with @xmath326 , see figure 15(c ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath192 and @xmath246 respectively determine the points where the kink orbit hits the characteristic hyperbola @xmath322 and ellipse @xmath324 .",
    "orbits for which the relation @xmath327 between integration constants holds meet at a single point on ellipse @xmath324 .",
    "the same happens for trajectories that comply with @xmath328 meeting at a point on the hyperbola @xmath322 .",
    "thus , at each point in @xmath322 and @xmath324 an infinite number of kink trajectories meet .",
    "these characteristic curves are focal lines .",
    "these solutions are so complex that it is not possible to invert the relationships ( [ eq : nu3 ] ) in order to obtain analytical expressions in cartesian coordinates for the kink form factors .",
    "for this reason , we parametrize these solutions in terms of the integration constants @xmath192 and @xmath246 that set the orbits in the hamilton - jacobi expressions ( [ eq : nu3 ] ) .",
    "the use , however , of the implicit expressions in elliptic coordinates allows mathematica to plot field profiles and energy densities .",
    "it should be mentioned that extreme care is necessary to guarantee continuity of the trajectories and its derivatives when it rebounds on the faces of the @xmath122 cuboid . in figure 15(a ) the form factor ( field profile ) of a @xmath321 kink is shown . in the figure 15(b )",
    "we display the energy showing seven basic lumps : two @xmath161 s , two @xmath148 s and three @xmath173 s , with the peculiarity that three different basic particles always travel together .",
    "we remark that there exist no net forces between particles in these configurations but that they are highly unstable against any perturbation splitting the centers of superposed particles .",
