    "surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) are half - photon half - electron surface waves .",
    "thanks to their dual nature , spps can be focused tighter than pure light , which is an important property for potential applications in optical processing of information . in the absence of lateral boundaries propagating spps",
    "are expected to diffract in the interface plane .",
    "one way to control diffraction is to structure the surface and make plasmonic waveguides , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use nonlinearity for the creation of spatial spp solitons , which are non - diffracting self - localized surface waves @xcite .",
    "other transverse effects with nonlinear plasmons , such as self - focusing and filamentation @xcite can be important for frequency conversion , switching and routing experiments with photonics chips .",
    "note , that the interplay between transverse and nonlinear effects have attracted significant attention outside the plasmonics and nanophotonics contexts , see , e.g. , @xcite for the historic accounts .",
    "nonlinear functionality of spps @xcite can be significantly hampered by ohmic losses resulting in short propagation distances .",
    "one of the possible solutions is to amplify spps by doping and pumping the dielectric , so that the losses are either partially or fully compensated @xcite .",
    "the linear dispersion of the amplified spps has been studied by several groups , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the linear results have been recently generalized to the more realistic case , when linear gain is nonlinearly saturated above the stimulated emission threshold @xcite .    analytical or semi - analytical approaches to describe nonlinear effects with spps are very important , since the first principle numerical modelling of nonlinear and multidimensional cases is still computationally demanding .",
    "recently the nonlinear shrodinger equation ( nls ) has been introduced for the plasmons in a slot waveguide formed by two planar metal dielectric interfaces @xcite and at a single interface @xcite .",
    "the _ averaging method _ implemented in @xcite has been borrowed from the theory of the dielectric waveguides @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one starts from the known solution for the linear spps : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the coordinate perpendicular to the interface , @xmath2 is the propagation direction and @xmath3 is the propagation constant . then introducing a slowly varying amplitude @xmath4 and assuming small nonlinearity , the maxwell equations are averaged in @xmath1 and the nls equation for @xmath5 is derived @xcite .",
    "the above approach has some drawbacks .",
    "first , it is sufficiently well justified only for the quasi - transverse fields , that approximately satisfy the wave equation @xcite .",
    "another problem is that it does not treat the boundary conditions rigorously . in particular , continuity of the normal to the interface component of the displacement @xmath6",
    "is guaranteed only in the linear approximation .",
    "if the intensity of the guided light peaks away from the interfaces and is small in the proximity of the latter ( like it typically happens in dielectric waveguides operating on the principle of total internal reflection ) , then the nonlinear terms in the boundary conditions can be disregarded .",
    "however , the spp intensity peaks exactly at the interface and nonlinear contribution to the boundary conditions is critical @xcite .",
    "this is also true for other types of nonlinear surface waves , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to develop a rigorous procedure of deriving the nonlinear evolution equation for surface plasmons , such that the continuity of @xmath6 is enforced together with its nonlinear part .",
    "below we develop a multiple - scale asymptotic approach for the amplified spps , which treats the nonlinear boundary conditions rigorously and reveals the differences with the results obtained by the averaging technique . the gain and complex nonlinearity we use",
    "are derived using the two - level model .",
    "our procedure leads to the complex ginzburg - landau equation that accounts for diffraction of spps in the interface plane .",
    "the nonlinearity enhancement factor derived by us is intrinsically complex , whilst the averaging approach gives a real one .",
    "the difference between the predictions of two approaches increases in the short wavelength limit , where spps are maximally localized at the interface , and thus the nonlinear part of the boundary condition is more important . using our theory we derive a criterion for spp filamentation and discuss bright and dark spatially localized spps . strictly speaking both soliton families are unstable , though the bright solitons demonstrate propagation distances sufficient for their practical observation .",
    "we assume that the interface between metal and dielectric is at @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the in - plane coordinates .",
    "the evolution of spps obeys the time independent maxwell equations @xmath9 the coordinates are dimensionless and normalized to the inverse wavenumber @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the vacuum wavelength .",
    "the permittivity on the dielectric side of the interface ( @xmath12 ) is @xmath13 the permittivity on the metal side ( @xmath14 ) is @xmath15    if spps are amplified by means of active inclusions in the dielectric , then @xmath16 and @xmath17 are functions of the gain coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "the propagation constant @xmath3 for linear plasmons is @xmath19 where @xmath3 becomes real at the threshold : @xmath20 @xcite : @xmath21 the linear and nonlinear permittivities for the dielectric at @xmath20 are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the active inclusions are approximated by the 2-level atom susceptibility . for light intensities much smaller than the transition saturation intensity @xmath24",
