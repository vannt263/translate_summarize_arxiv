    "one of the most impressive achievements of the characteristic approach is its demonstrated ability to carry out long - term stable evolutions  @xcite of generic single black hole spacetimes .",
    "work is under way to extend these numerical simulations to the post - merger regime of binary black hole coalescence , by first computing the gravitational radiation emitted during a white hole fission  @xcite , and then extending these results to compute the gravitational waveforms emitted during the post - merger phase of a binary black hole collision  @xcite .",
    "the present work is an outgrowth of one of these projects , having been motivated by numerical difficulties that we have encountered with the present implementation of the characteristic code  @xcite . in the course of our simulations of a white - hole fission  @xcite",
    ", we have noticed an angular oscillation mode in some of the metric variables of the characteristic formulation , similar in appearance to a _ red - black _  @xcite decoupling .",
    "numerical experiments reveal that although the area that it affects can be somewhat reduced , its amplitude does not converge to zero with increasing grid resolution for practical grid sizes in the rapidly changing environment near the time of merger of a binary black hole .",
    "we had expected to see convergence in this regime , given the measured second order convergence of the code on less rapidly changing solutions , even at fairly low resolutions  @xcite .",
    "this effect is clearly of numerical nature , and would not have been observed in earlier work , as it is only triggered when , in addition to extreme nonlinearities in the metric functions ( such as those found in the post - merger phase of the head - on collision of two black holes , or in the time - reversed picture , during the fission of a single black - hole ) , a fairly large degree of asymmetry and of time dependence in the metric functions is present .",
    "moreover , it appears that even when some of these conditions are satisfied , the dissipation built into the algorithm used for the evolution the conformal metric of the spheres  @xcite can , in certain circumstances , be sufficient to suppress the spurious oscillations , provided the boundary data is specified analytically  @xcite .    in the systems that we have previously considered , such as robinson - trautman spacetimes , a perturbed kerr black hole  @xcite and the collapse of matter into a black hole  @xcite , our choice of the gauge conditions at the boundary effectively precluded fulfilling the second condition above . in all cases ,",
    "the boundary data was given analytically , so no extraneous effects could be observed .",
    "this oscillatory mode is not an _",
    "unstable _ mode of the finite difference approximation in the usual sense of exponential growth of the error .",
    "this is confirmed by tests where random initial and/or boundary data  @xcite is prescribed , and the code run for many crossing times .",
    "but it is worth pointing out that while those tests are useful to spot exponentially growing modes , they would not detect a non - exponentially growing oscillatory mode such as the one we address here .",
    "we observe , in fact , an inaccuracy in the computation of the metric variable @xmath0 , which does not converge to zero , and gets triggered in situations where there are large angular variations and rapid time changes in the metric variables , specially in @xmath1 , eq .  ( [ eq : bmet ] ) .",
    "because @xmath1 is related to the time slicing of the boundary ( and in the black hole case , this boundary is the event horizon @xmath2 ) , @xmath1 will indeed change substantially near the time of _ coalescence _ of a binary black hole horizon ( or , in the time - reversed description actually used by our numerical code , near the time of _ fission _ of a white hole ) .",
    "the pitt null code runs stably in the usual sense ( without exponentially growing modes ) in the configurations that we have explored .",
    "the effect of the angular noise is nevertheless important for our present purposes , since the angular error it introduces in the metric functions is most pronounced near null infinity , and this in turn spoils the accuracy of the waveforms computed .",
    "we have found that the difficulty lies with the characteristic evolution equations themselves , and it is not a boundary - induced effect . although the boundary ( horizon ) data is smooth and , by construction , satisfies the consistency conditions  @xcite , the evolution and hypersurface equations themselves introduce the above mentioned oscillation mode , which is shown clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : wold ] . we have found clear evidence that the origin of the difficulty lies with those terms in the equations that contain second angular derivatives .",
    "these type of terms are present both in the evolution equation for the conformal metric of the surfaces at constant luminosity distance @xmath3 , and in the hypersurface equation for the metric function @xmath0 itself .",
    "most notably , when this terms are suppressed , so is the angular oscillation mode in @xmath0 .",
    "the most troublesome terms are those containing second angular derivatives of the metric variable @xmath1 , of the form @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "second angular derivatives of the conformal metric @xmath6 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bmet ] ) , also appear in the hypersurface equation for @xmath0 , in the form of @xmath7 and @xmath8 operators acting on quantities defined in terms of the conformal metric .",
    "however , these terms do not seem to lead to numerical difficulties as pronounced as those caused by the terms involving second angular derivatives of @xmath1 , although the reason behind this is not entirely clear at the moment .",
    "it is possible that in the present regime the contribution from these terms is not as important .",
    "our rationale for implementing the characteristic code in mixed first and second order form has been that doing so is entirely straightforward , and leads to an accurate and stable discretization with the least number of variables .",
    "the argument of using the least variables is compelling ; however one must consider whether relaxing this requirement might not lead to better overall numerical behavior .",
    "we will show that this is indeed the case .",
    "rigorous stability arguments can be given for the linearized system  @xcite in the axisymmetric case , with the analysis extending unmodified to the full three - dimensional problem as shown in  @xcite .",
    "later work  @xcite has shown that special care must be taken in the nonlinear case , as some unstable modes are present that are not revealed by the von - neuman analysis of the linear problem .",
    "one must keep in mind however that a stable discretization of a model problem as in  @xcite may not address other issues such as those raised here . the numerical analysis for mixed order systems",
    "is not yet at the level of sophistication achieved for first differential order systems .",
    "long - term stable evolutions  @xcite have been achieved , and this is a consequence of the remarkably good choice of variables and coordinates inherent to bondi s system of equations , as well as of the care taken in implementing them numerically .",
    "we have attempted to solve the problem at hand by the expeditious method of introducing further dissipation in the equations , in the spirit of  @xcite .",
    "regrettably , these numerical remedies do not seem to have the desired effect , apparently because they do not go to the root of the problem .",
    "we consider here a different solution , which is analytic in nature , but motivated by a numerical application , specifically the need to attain controlled accuracy in the computation of gravitational waveforms out of highly distorted single black hole systems .",
    "our approach is to remove the offending second angular derivatives from our system of equations altogether , by introducing additional variables , in terms of which the enlarged system can be written in first differential order form in the angular coordinates .",
    "we thus implement a _ partial _ reduction to a first differential order system , leaving the radial part of the evolution equations in second order form , and allowing for mixed radial and angular derivatives , both in the original equations and in the auxiliary equations introduced .",
    "one goal is to preserve , where appropriate , the radial and time integration schemes developed for the pitt null code , whose long - term stability ( in the usual sense of not having exponentially growing modes ) has been amply demonstrated  @xcite . at the same time , we perform the necessary modification to the system of equations to make the pitt null code useful for the problem at hand .",
