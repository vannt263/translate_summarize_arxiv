    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data have greatly contributed to the building of a cosmological model , named concordance @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) model , see @xcite for the last cosmological analysis of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data and see @xcite for the recent planck cosmological results .",
    "this model involves a set of basic quantities for which cmb observations and other cosmological and astrophysical data - sets agree extracted from planck cmb and galaxy clusters data . ] : spatial curvature close to zero ; @xmath8 of the cosmic density in the form of dark energy ; @xmath9 in cold dark matter ( cdm ) ; @xmath10 in baryonic matter ; and a nearly scale invariant adiabatic , gaussian primordial perturbations @xcite .",
    "however there are several interesting deviation from the @xmath0cdm model , often called anomalies , specially at large angular scales @xcite where cmb anisotropies probe the physics of the early universe .",
    "if they are statistical flukes or deterministically due to some unknown effect is still an open question .",
    "see @xcite for a prescription based on polarization data , to test the hypothesis that the large - angle cmb temperature perturbations in our universe represent a rare statistical fluctuation within @xmath0cdm model .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion about the `` a posteriori '' bias that might affect these analyses . in the current paper we focus on the lack of power in the two point correlation function of the temperature cmb anisotropies for angles larger than @xmath11 .",
    "such intriguing discrepancy has been already noted with cobe data @xcite and then by the wmap team in their first year release @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that this event happens in only 0.03% of realizations of the @xmath0cdm model using wmap 3 and 5 years data .",
    "such a lack of power is confirmed in a later analysis @xcite using wmap 5 year data but at the same time it is found with a bayesian approach that the @xmath0cdm model can not be excluded .",
    "wmap 7 year data are taken into account by @xcite , where it is also shown that such anomaly does not correlate with the anomalous alignment of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 multipoles .    here ,",
    "we compute the two - point correlation function , @xmath14 , using wmap 9 year low resolution data in temperature .",
    "this correlation function is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the legendre polynomials and with @xmath18 being the angular power spectrum ( aps ) of the temperature cmb map .",
    "we build @xmath14 through eq .",
    "( [ ctt ] ) evaluating the aps with a quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimator .",
    "this method is proven to be optimal since it provides unbiased and minimum variance estimates @xcite .",
    "the optimality of the qml method is compared to pseudo-@xmath19 methods in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that at the lowest multipoles ( i.e. @xmath20 ) the variance of the qml method is roughly half that of the pseudo-@xmath19 approach .",
    "this makes the qml method for aps essential for the computation of the two point correlation function since such an object is dominated by the lowest multipoles .    once the two - point correlation function is computed , we evaluate the following estimator , @xmath3 @xcite @xmath21 as well as its natural generalization @xmath5 to the whole angular range @xmath22 eqs .",
    "( [ s1su2estimator ] ) and ( [ sfullestimator ] ) have to be considered as estimators of the distance from the null value .",
    "they are used to test the lack of correlation , i.e. how much likely is for a cmb extraction ( compatible with the wmap 9 best fit model ) to be close to the zero value . instead in order to test the compatibility with the @xmath0cdm model we define the following analogous estimators @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the two point correlation function for temperature cmb anisotropies expected in a given @xmath0cdm model , that in following will be the wmap 9 best fit model .",
    "( [ s1su2estimatorlambda ] ) and ( [ sfullestimatorlambda ] ) have to be considered as estimators of the distance from @xmath26 .",
    "they are used to test the compatibility with the wmap 9 best fit model .",

    "( [ s1su2estimator ] ) , ( [ sfullestimator ] ) , ( [ s1su2estimatorlambda ] ) , ( [ sfullestimatorlambda ] ) and compare with wmap 9 year data",
    ". moreover we test the stability of our results on various galactic sky cuts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ dataset ] is devoted to the description of the considered wmap 9 year low resolution data set .",
    "a general analysis of the two - point correlation function of wmap 9 year data is given in section [ twopoints ] .",
    "the evaluation of the estimators and corresponding analysis are presented in section [ estimators ] . in section [ connectionwithaps ]",
    "the low amplitudes of the lowest aps are recognized as responsible of the lack of correlation at large scales .",
    "this makes a connection with the low variance anomaly , see for example @xcite .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] . in appendix [ qmlbolpol ] details about the aps estimator are provided .",
    "appendix [ consistency ] gives a comparison between the estimators build with our aps extractor and with the spectrum provided by the wmap team @xcite .",
    "we use the temperature ilc wmap 9 year map , available at the lambda website , smoothed at @xmath27 degrees and reconstructed at healpix @xcite resolution @xmath28 .",
    "we have added to that map a random noise realization with variance of @xmath29 as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this is done to regularize the inversion of the covariance matrix .",
    "because of its amplitude , such an additional white noise covers the correlated noise present in the ilc map due to the smoothing of the data and , at the same time , is sufficiently low to not impact the subsequent analysis .",
    "consistently , the noise covariance matrix for tt is taken to be diagonal with variance equal to @xmath29 when using our qml implementation , namely bolpol @xcite .",
    "see also appendix [ qmlbolpol ] .    the temperature ilc wmap 9 year map has been masked with various galactic masks that are shown in fig .",
    "more specifically , these masks are built extending the edges of the kq85 temperature mask by 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 and 20 degrees .",
    "see table [ maskstabel ] for details of the considered cases including the observed sky fraction .",
    "in this section we evaluate eq .",

    "in the present paper we have evaluated the two - point correlation function of wmap 9 year data .",
    "this function has been computed using the aps estimates obtained through a qml method which is proven to be optimal @xcite , see also appendix [ qmlbolpol ] .",
    "the behavior of this function has been tested against various galactic masks , see table [ maskstabel ] and fig .",
    "the cases of table [ maskstabel ] have been confronted with the wmap 9 best fit model , see fig .",
    "[ fig : minipage2 ] .",
    "this has been possible thanks to mc realistic simulations , each of them being analyzed with our implementation of qml estimator .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : minipage2 ] , we have qualitatively noted that the increase of the mask pushes @xmath30 downward for @xmath31 . at the same time at large scales ,",
    "i.e. @xmath32 , @xmath30 is going systematically upward still when the mask is larger .",
    "this means that @xmath30 is more consistent with @xmath0cdm model ( and with no - correlation ) when the sky area around the kq85 mask is dropped out from the analysis .",
    "the latter behavior also suggests that increasing the mask , the so called tt parity anomaly is becoming milder , since @xmath33 is a natural estimator for the even - odd multipole power asymmetry .",
    "moreover we have quantitatively evaluated @xmath3 and @xmath5 in order to estimate the consistency with no correlation .",
    "we have demonstrated that the anomaly is showing up enlarging the kq 85 mask .",
    "[ quattrotris ] makes evident how the anomalies percentage monotonically decreases with the masked area .",
    "note that not only @xmath3 is anomalous for a @xmath0cdm model ( see first column of table [ percentages ] ) but also its generalization @xmath34 , which does not suffer of any `` a posteriori bias '' , is very unlikely at the level of @xmath6 c.l .",
    "for the considered masks that cover at least @xmath7 of the sky ( see second column of table [ percentages ] ) .",
    "the other two considered estimators , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are found to be consistent with @xmath0cdm model , see third and fourth columns of table [ percentages ] .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ quattro ] for an explicit computation of the distribution of @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in a @xmath0cdm model ( histograms ) and the corresponding wmap value ( vertical bars ) .",
    "furthermore we have shown that increasing artificially the quadrupole and octupole values from what observed @xcite to the wmap 9 best fit values , makes @xmath3 and @xmath5 not anomalous , see fig .",
    "[ s1su2es1-fakec2ec3 ] and table [ percentagesfake ] .",
    "this indicates that the low amplitude of the lowest aps are responsible of the lack of correlation in the two - point correlation function .",
    "this fact represents a connection with the low variance anomaly which is driven by the same multipoles @xcite .",
