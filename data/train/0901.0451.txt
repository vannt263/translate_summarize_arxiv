    "phase transitions occurring in the bulk , but driven by specific conditions at its boundaries , are called _ boundary - induced phase transitions _  @xcite .",
    "examples include diffusive transport  @xcite and traffic flow  @xcite models .",
    "a simple example for this is provided by the one - dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process @xcite , where particles enter the system at the left boundary , jump to the right in the bulk , and exit at the right boundary .",
    "depending on the entering and exiting rate values , the system exhibits qualitatively different phenomenologies ( maximal current , large current and low density , or small current and high density ) , with straightforward applications to traffic flow problems .    in the present work , we are interested in boundary - induced phase transitions in systems with absorbing states .",
    "an absorbing state is a dynamical trap which can be accessed but can not be left  @xcite .",
    "systems with absorbing phase transitions are controlled by a parameter , depending on which the system either enters the absorbing state with certainty or survives in a stationary fluctuating / active state .",
    "the most prominent family of phase transitions into an absorbing state is the very robust direct percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "a recent breakthrough has been the experimental observation of dp critical behavior for the first time  @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic model in the dp universality class is the contact process ( cp ) @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a simple model for the propagation of a disease where sick individuals can infect healthy neighbors or become healthy spontaneously .",
    "more precisely , in the cp in @xmath1 spatial dimensions , a particle ( infected individual ) can be created at an `` empty '' site with a rate @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of nearest neighbors occupied by a particle , and an occupied site can become empty at rate @xmath4 .",
    "the empty configuration is an absorbing state . for @xmath5 larger than a certain critical threshold , @xmath6",
    ", the process is able to sustain ( in an infinite lattice ) a non - vanishing density of particles , while for @xmath7 the dynamics ends up , ineluctably , in the absorbing state .",
    "as continuous phase transitions involve long - range correlations , boundary effects may play an important role . in the context of absorbing phase transitions , previous studies focused primarily on dp confined to parabolas  @xcite , active walls  @xcite , as well as absorbing walls and edges  @xcite .",
    "although such boundaries influence the dynamics deep into the bulk , the universality class of the bulk transition is not inherently changed , rather it is extended by an additional independent exponent describing the order parameter near the boundary . therefore , the question arises whether it is possible to find boundary - induced absorbing phase transitions , absent in the corresponding systems without boundaries , constituting independent universality classes .    in this paper",
    "we present a detailed discussion of two slightly different models introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "both of them exhibit a boundary - induced nonequilibrium phase transition into an absorbing state .",
    "these are one - dimensional particle systems consisting of a single site ( and , at most , its nearest neighbor ) , where creation and annihilation of particles occur , and a bulk , where particles move diffusively .",
    "while in the first reference @xcite , the dynamics at the boundary is a contact process , in the second one  @xcite particles at the origin annihilate only pairwise ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we study different versions of these models to compare them and scrutinize the relevance of relaxing the fermionic constraint ( i.e. occupation number not restricted to @xmath9 or @xmath4 ) both at the bulk and at the boundary .",
    "our study includes mean field approximations , numerical analysis , some field theoretical arguments , as well as the relation with a ( 0 + 1)-dimensional non - markovian model  @xcite .",

    "particles in the bulk perform a symmetric exclusion process , moving to any of their two neighbors with equal probability , provided that the destination site is empty ( otherwise nothing happens ) .    starting with a single particle at the leftmost site in an otherwise absorbing ( i.e. empty ) configuration",

    "we expect that off - critical simulations of the survival probability give the exponent @xmath35 but the simulation times needed to reach steady state are prohibitively long .",
    "an explanation for the value @xmath83 , differing from @xmath73 , is given in the following subsection .",
    "in ordinary bond dp , the statistical weight of a configuration of percolating paths does not depend on the direction of time . more specifically ,",
    "the probability to find an open path from at least one site at time @xmath84 to a particular site at time @xmath76 coincides with the probability to find an open path from a particular site at time @xmath84 to at least one site at time @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that , in bond dp , _",
    "i ) _ the density @xmath85 in simulations with fully occupied initial state and _ ii ) _ the survival probability @xmath75 in seed simulations coincide ; hence @xmath42 .",
    "in other realizations of dp ( e.g. site dp ) , this time reversal symmetry is not exact but only asymptotically realized .",
    "applying the same arguments to the present model , the survival probability @xmath75 in seed simulations should scale in the same way as the density of active sites at the boundary @xmath20 in a process starting with a _ fully occupied lattice _ in the bulk .",

    "following the arguments of  @xcite in a related model , this observation can be used to provide an heuristic explanation for the fact that @xmath88 .",
    "it is known that , if the boundary acts as a sink or perfect trap ( e.g. if @xmath89 ) , then , in a process starting with a fully occupied lattice , one observes a growing depletion zone around the boundary whose linear size @xmath90 increases as @xmath91 , with @xmath92 ( see @xcite and the next subsection ) .",
    "thus , the density of active sites decays as @xmath21 .",
    "hence , the influx of particles from the bulk to the leftmost site may be considered as an effective time - dependent external field @xmath93 .",
    "making the assumption that this field varies so slowly that the response of the process ( i.e. the actual average activity at the boundary ) behaves adiabatically , as if the field was constant , then in a critical process starting from an initially fully occupied state : @xmath94 owing to the time reversal property , this quantity should decay as the survival probability .",
    "this chain of heuristic arguments leads to the conjecture that the survival exponent is given by @xmath95 , in agreement with the numerical estimate @xmath72 .",
    "this unusual value of the exponent @xmath78 is clearly related to the fact that the present problem is inhomogeneous .",
    "the argumentation presented above does not work for the cp , for example , since there is no special site and , therefore , a fully occupied lattice can not be interpreted as a time dependent field acting on a special site .",

    "the relation can be explained as follows : consider the cp - like model only from the perspective of the leftmost site .",
    "a particle at the origin may die or create a new particle that will go for a random walk coming back to the origin after a time @xmath187 .",
    "what happens during this random walk is irrelevant from the perspective of the leftmost site ; the only relevant aspect is the time needed for a created particle to come back to the boundary .",
    "once it returns it may die or create new offsprings which , on their turn , will undergo random walks in the bulk .",
    "our simulations above show that the fermionic constraint is irrelevant in the bulk .",
    "therefore , we can consider without lost of generality the bulk - bosonic version in which there is no effective interaction among diffusing particles . in this case",
    ", the probability distribution of the returning time to the origin has the well - known asymptotic form  @xcite : @xmath188 taking all these elements into account we define the following non - markovian model on a single site  @xcite :    1 .",

    "4 .   go back to ( b ) .",
    "the process runs until the system enters the absorbing state ( @xmath195 for all @xmath196 ) or a predetermined maximum time is exceeded .     as a function of @xmath60 for different values of @xmath19 , with @xmath197 .",
    "[ fig : datacollapse],width=328 ]    the density of particles at the leftmost site of the original model is related to @xmath198 in the single - site model , the survival probability at time @xmath76 is given by the fraction of runs surviving at least up to @xmath76 , and the initial condition @xmath189 corresponds to start with a single particle at the boundary in the full model .",
    "critical exponents can be defined as in the original model .",
    "however , the simulation results for the single - site non - markovian model are more reliable because it is possible to perform much longer runs and , in the case of off - critical simulations , one can work with smaller values of @xmath19 . with time - dependent simulations at the critical point @xmath199",
    ", we obtained @xmath200 and @xmath201 , in good agreement with the conjectured values @xmath69 and @xmath178 .",
    "as an example , we show the results of supercritical simulations in fig .  [",
    "fig : datacollapse ] , where we obtained a convincing data collapse by plotting @xmath202 as a function of @xmath60 for different values of @xmath19 with @xmath203 .",
    "the latter estimate is in agreement with @xmath49 , coming from the original model .    as shown in previous studies ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , a non - markovian time evolution with algebraically distributed waiting times @xmath204 is generated by so - called fractional derivatives @xmath205 which are defined by : @xmath206\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath207 $ ] and @xmath208 is a normalization constant .",
    "hence , we expect this model to be described by a dp - like @xmath9-dimensional langevin equation with a half - time derivative , instead of the usual one , to account for the non - markovian character of the model : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is proportional to the distance from criticality and @xmath211 is a multiplicative noise with correlations @xmath212",
    ". this equation can be obtained from the effective action that arises when the fields related to diffusion in the bulk are integrated out , and the relation of the order of the fractional derivative in a generalized one - site model with the dimension in the full model is @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "an analysis of this one - site model with general @xmath214 and a comparison with the results coming from field theory is presented in @xcite .",
    "we have studied boundary - induced phase transitions into an absorbing state in one - dimensional systems with creation / annihilation dynamics at the boundary and simple diffusive dynamics in the bulk .",
    "the non - trivial dynamics at the boundary induces a phase transition in the bulk .",
    "we have analyzed such a transition for different though similar models , including different ingredients : either single - particle annihilation or pairwise annihilation , fermionic constraint or lack of it , etc .",
    "a particular bosonic version can be exactly solved ; owing to the lack of any saturation mechanism , the density of particles grows unboundedly in the active phase , leading to a discontinuous transition with trivial critical exponents .",
    "the rest of the analyzed models exhibit a continuous transition and define a unique universality class . at the bulk",
    ", the dynamics is governed by random - walks , entailing the exponent values @xmath103 and @xmath47 .",
    "on the other hand , some critical exponents take non - trivial values : _",
    "i ) _ the survival probability from a localized seed at the boundary exponent , which from an heuristic argument supported by simulations results , turns out to be @xmath215 , as well as _",
    "ii ) _ the order parameter exponent , @xmath197 . the remaining exponents can be obtained from these ones using scaling relations .",
    "finally , it has been shown that the class of boundary induced phase transitions studied here can be related to a single - site non - markovian process .",
    "this process is particularly suitable for numerical simulations and it is also of conceptual interest in the sense that it shows that nonequilibrium phase transitions can occur even in @xmath216 dimensions by choosing an adequate non - markovian dynamics .",
    "it is also convenient for the comparison of the results obtained form the @xmath172-expansion and simulations @xcite .",
    "the models studied here possibly constitute the simplest universality class of nonequilibrium phase transition into an absorbing state , in the sense that the transition occurs because of the special dynamics of just one site and , in contrast to dp , some critical exponents can be obtained exactly from the field theory .",
