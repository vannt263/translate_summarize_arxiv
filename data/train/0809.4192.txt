    "one of our aims is to give the framework of fibred and cofibred categories to certain colimit calculations of algebraic homotopical invariants for spaces with parts glued together : the data here is information on the invariants of the parts , and of the gluing process .",
    "the second aim is to advertise the possibility of such calculations , which are based on various higher homotopy van kampen theorems ( hhvkts ) , proved in 1978 - 87 .",
    "these are of the form that a _ homotopically defined _",
    "functor @xmath0 preserves certain colimits @xcite , and where the algebraic data contains non - abelian information .",
    "the antecedent for dimension 1 of such functors as @xmath1 is the fundamental group @xmath2 of based spaces : the van kampen theorem in its form due to crowell , @xcite , gives that this @xmath3 preserves certain pushouts .",
    "the next advance was the fundamental groupoid functor @xmath4 from spaces @xmath5 with a _ set _",
    "@xmath6 of base points to groupoids : groupoids in effect carry information in dimensions 0 and 1 .",
    "for example , the groupoid van kampen theorem @xcite gives the fundamental group of the circle as the infinite cyclic group @xmath7 obtained in the category of groupoids from the ( finite ) groupoid @xmath8,\\{0,1\\})$ ] by identifying @xmath9 .",
    "that is , we have the analogous pushouts @xmath10 \\ar[d ] & \\ar [ d ]   \\{0\\}\\\\    [ 0,1 ] \\ar [ r ] & s^1 } } \\overset{\\pi_1}{\\mapsto }     \\vcenter{\\xymatrix{\\{0,1\\ } \\ar[r ] \\ar[d ] & \\ar [ d ]   \\{0\\}\\\\    { { \\mathcal i}}\\ar [ r ] & { \\mathsf{c}}}}\\ ] ] the first in the category of spaces , the second in the category of groupoids , and @xmath3 takes the first with the appropriate sets of base points , to the second . the aim is to have a similar argument at the module level for @xmath11 .",
    "one of the problems of obtaining such results in higher homotopy theory is that low dimensional identifications of spaces usually affect high dimensional homotopy invariants . to cope with this fact",
    ", the algebraic data for the values of the functor @xmath1 must have structure interacting from low to high dimensions , in order to model how the spaces are glued together .",
    "an example of such dimensional interaction is the operation of the fundamental group on the higher homotopy groups , which fascinated the early workers in homotopy theory ( private communication , j.h.c .",
    "whitehead , 1957 ) .",
    "this operation can be seen as necessitated by the dependence of these groups on the base point , but is somewhat neglected in algebraic topology , perhaps for perceived deficiencies in modes of calculations .",
    "a recognised reason for the difficulty of traditional invariants such as homotopy groups in dealing with gluing spaces , and so obtaining colimit calculations , is the failure of excision . if @xmath5 is the union of open sets @xmath12 with intersection @xmath13 then the inclusion of pairs @xmath14 does not induce an isomorphism of relative homotopy groups as it does for singular homology .",
    "however there is a residue of homotopical excision which can be deduced from a hhvkt , as in @xcite ; it requires connectivity conditions and gives information in only the critical dimension , but this information involves the additional structure of operations .",
    "we state it at this stage for a single base point , as follows :    * homotopical excision theorem ( het ) * _ if @xmath12 and @xmath15 are path connected with base point @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is @xmath18-connected , @xmath19 , then @xmath20 is @xmath18-connected and the excision map @xmath21 presents the @xmath22-module @xmath23 as induced by the morphism of fundamental groups @xmath24 from the @xmath25-module @xmath26 .",
    "the same holds for @xmath27 with ` module ' replaced by ` crossed module ' .",
    "_    we show that this theorem implies the classical relative hurewicz theorem , ( corollary [ cor : rht ] ) for which in more usual terms see for example @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath27 implies a deep theorem of whitehead on free crossed modules ( corollary [ cor : freeonattaching ] ) ( of which @xcite explains the original proof ) , and indeed allows the more general calculation of @xmath28 as a crossed @xmath2-module ( corollary [ cor : attachcone ] ) .",
    "that result is applied in @xcite to calculate crossed modules representing some homotopy 2-types of mapping cones of maps of classifying spaces of groups .",
    "the notion of _ inducing _ used here is both an indication of the existence of some universal properties in higher homotopy theory , and also of the tools needed to exploit such properties as there are . in the case",
    "@xmath29 the inducing construction is well known for modules over groups : if @xmath30 is a module over the group @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a morphism of groups , then the induced module @xmath33 is isomorphic to @xmath34 . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the analogous construction is non - abelian .",
    "we give the approach of fibred and cofibred categories to this inducing construction .",
    "also the following simple example of algebraic modelling of a gluing process suggests a further generalisation is needed .",
    "consider the following maps involving the @xmath35-sphere @xmath36 , the first an inclusion and the second an identification : @xmath37 { \\stackrel{p}{\\longrightarrow } } s^n \\vee s^1.\\ ] ] here @xmath38 , the base point @xmath39 of @xmath36 is in the second space identified with @xmath40 , and the map @xmath41 identifies @xmath9 to give the circle @xmath42 .",
    "this clearly requires an algebraic theory dealing with many base points , and so a generalisation from groups to groupoids .",
    "the geometry of the base points and their interconnections can then play a role in the theory and applications .",
    "this programme has proved successful for the algebraic data of _ crossed complexes over groupoids _ , or equivalent structures , and for _ cat@xmath43-groups _ , or , equivalently , crossed @xmath35-cubes of groups . in both categories there",
    "is a hhvkt asserting that a homotopically defined functor @xmath1 preserves certain colimits , and this leads to new calculations of homotopical invariants .",
    "the calculation of colimits in these algebraic categories usually requires working up in dimensions .",
    "so it is useful to consider for these hierarchical structures the forgetful functors from higher complex structures to lower structures .",
    "the prototype again is groupoids , with the object functor from groupoids to sets .",
    "the fibre of this functor over a set @xmath44 is written @xmath45 : the objects of this category are groupoids with object set @xmath44 and morphisms are functors which are the identity on @xmath44 .",
    "this fibre has nice properties , and is what is called _ protomodular _ ; in rough terms it has properties analogous to those of the category of groups . in particular , there is a notion of normal subgroupoid , and of coproduct , so that colimits can be calculated in @xmath45 as quotients of a coproduct by a normal subobject .",
    "however the whole category @xmath46 is of interest for homotopical modelling .",
    "the functor @xmath47 has the properties of being a fibration and a cofibration in the sense of grothendieck , @xcite .",
    "so a function @xmath48 of sets gives rise to a pair of functors @xmath49 , known often as pullback , and @xmath50 , which could be called ` pushin ' or ` push forward ' , such that @xmath51 is left adjoint to @xmath52 .",
    "so for @xmath53 we have a morphism @xmath54 over @xmath55 with a universal property which is traditionally called ` cocartesian ' , and it is also said that @xmath56 is the object _ induced from @xmath5 by @xmath55_.    it is interesting to see that the main parts of the pattern for groupoids goes over to the general case .",
    "our categorical results are for a fibration of categories @xmath57 .",
    "the first and a main result ( theorem [ thm : preservecolimfibres ] ) is that the inclusion @xmath58 of a fibre @xmath59 of @xmath60 preserves colimits of connected diagrams .",
    "our second set of results relates pushouts in @xmath61 to the construction of the functors @xmath62 for @xmath55 a morphism in @xmath63 ( proposition [ prop : induced - pushout ] ) .",
    "finally , we show how the combination of these results uses the computation of colimits in @xmath63 and in each @xmath59 to give the computation of colimits in @xmath61 ( theorem [ thm : compcolim - fibred ] ) .",
    "these general results are developed in the spirit of ` categories for the working mathematician ' in sections [ sec : fibcat ] to [ sec : pushouts ] .",
    "we illustrate the use of these results for homotopical calculations not only in groupoids ( section [ sec : groupoidsinduced ] ) , but also for crossed modules ( section [ sec : xmodgpd ] ) and for modules , in both cases over groupoids . finally we give a brief account of some relevance to crossed squares ( section [ sec : crossedsquares ] ) , as an indication of a more extensive theory , and in which these ideas need development .",
    "we are grateful to thomas streicher for his lecture notes @xcite , on which the following account of fibred categories is based , and for helpful comments leading to improvements in the proofs .",
    "for further accounts of fibred and cofibred categories , see @xcite and the references there .",
    "the first paper gives analogies between fibrations of categories and hurewicz fibrations of spaces .",
    "we recall the definition of fibration of categories .",
    "let @xmath64 be a functor .",
    "a morphism @xmath65 in @xmath61 over @xmath66 is called _ cartesian _ if and only if for all @xmath67 in @xmath63 and @xmath68 with @xmath69 there is a unique morphism @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",

[ example : ob ] the forgetful functor , @xmath93 , from the category of groupoids to the category of sets is a fibration .",
