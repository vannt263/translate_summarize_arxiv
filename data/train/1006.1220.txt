    "it is often assumed that the discs of classical t tauri stars are those in which planets form .",
    "these ` class ii ' objects have disc - dominated dust emission in the infrared to millimetre , in contrast to fainter remnant discs around class iii ( weak - line ) t tauri stars , or the envelope - dominated emission of the earlier - stage class 0 and i protostars . provided that dust persists for a few myr in class  ii discs , along with the gas component that contains the bulk of the mass @xcite , then gas giants should be able to form by core accretion followed by accumulation of a thick atmosphere @xcite .",
    "however , it has been noted recently that the masses of t  tauri discs as derived from millimetre observations are typically small compared to the reservoirs needed for gas - giant formation .",
    "@xcite inferred that the median class ii disc comprises only 5 jupiter masses of dust and gas , from deep surveys of the taurus and ophiuchus regions .",
    "in contrast , at least 20 jupiter masses was present in the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) , on the basis of the rocky content now locked up in planetary cores @xcite . in models , a mass - reservoir a few times larger is actually needed for core - accretion to successfully build the the sun s giant planets .",
    "for example , @xcite find that a 120 jupiter - mass is adopted throughout , rather than the true inverse mass ratio of 1047 . ] or 6-mmsn disc can make all four giants .",
    "there are also examples of more massive exo - planets than the sun s giants , probably requiring more substantial discs from which to form .",
    "hence , if exo - discs only comprise a few jupiter - masses , there is a ` missing mass ' problem at these early stages .",
    "further , the surface densities that are the critical parameter in core accretion models are typically measured to be lower than expected , for example in relation to forming jupiter at around 5  au @xcite .",
    "millimetre dust emission is a good choice for measuring total disc - masses , being of low optical depth and reasonably bright , but limited angular resolution means that material at a few au is not resolved .",
    "although the bulk of the disc mass should be at large scales @xcite , discontinuous profiles with a strong central mass peak can not be ruled out . however , if the profiles are smooth , the typical outer radii of @xmath1  au @xcite are much larger than the solar system , exacerbating the missing - mass problem by further reducing the inferred inner - disc surface densities .",
    "several types of solution to the missing - mass problem have been proposed .",
    "the conversion of millimetre flux to dust mass is via the grain temperature and emissivity , and while the former can be estimated from the wavelength of peak emission , the latter is more uncertain and comes from modelling of grain properties @xcite . decreasing",
    "the adopted emissivity would enhance the derived disc masses , and this could be reasonable for a different composition , or a size distribution where much of the mass is in large grains .",
    "such ` pebbles ' are not conspicuous in the millimetre measurements but can be detected by radio continuum emission @xcite .",
    "in addition , the total disc masses could be wrong if the assumed gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 , i.e. inherited from the interstellar medium , is in error",
    ". a higher conversion factor would be correct if some of the dust has evolved into non - observable forms ( * anywhere from small pebbles up to * planetesimals ) but the gas is still all in the disc .",
    "the true disc masses should then be higher if a more appropriate gas - to - dust ratio were used .",
    "similarly , if some of the gas has also been accreted into planets , the disc mass estimates are even more uncertain but will underestimate the initial reservoir .",
    "* generally , @xcite have shown that the disc masses estimated via the amount of accretion onto the star are substantially higher than the masses derived directly from the observed dust , confirming that there is indeed a discrepancy within the available data . *",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     figure  5 shows representative spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of the star plus disc system  generated using the ho - chunk : 3d radiation transfer code @xcite  for a standard power - law distribution of disc mass ( top panel ) , and a case where more material has been artifically added inside 10  au to double the total disc material ( bottom panel ) .",
    "there is very little difference in the sed of the power - law and centrally - enhanced discs , especially in the millimetre regime that is canonically ` mass tracing ' .",
    "in fact , the centrally condensed disc has a submillimetre flux that is slightly lower than that from the lower - mass , power - law disc .",
    "therefore , if real discs are in fact massive , a central pile - up would be both theoretically predicted @xcite and not detected in millimetre images where the inner disc is unresolved .",
    "this provides a potential solution to the missing mass , at least for discs with moderately high mass estimates already .      as discussed above , discs have higher mass at earlier evolutionary stages . at class",
    "i , the fraction of objects hosting 2 - 25  mmsn is around 18  % , in the regime of jupiter - building models , and also matching the 18  % of gas - giant planet systems inferred around mature stars @xcite .",
    "however , if planetary cores can grow this early on  which could indeed occur if migration were to accelerate the core growth as noted above  then in principle the process could even start in the class  0 protostar phase , within the first 0.1  myr . at this time",
    "the central object is only partly accreted , and much of the mass of the system is still in a circumstellar envelope .",
    "millimetre photometry will be dominated by the envelope flux , but many of the class  0 objects have now been studied with millimetre - wavelength interferometry .",
    "this resolves out the large - scale envelope emission , leaving in most cases a compact or point - like signal attributed to a very young disc .",
    "table  3 lists these interferometry - based results , in order of increasing disc mass .",
    "the mass estimates were made with different methods and assumed temperatures and emissivities , and may be lower limits at @xmath2  mm if the inner disc has non - negligible opacity , so only rough comparisons may be made .",
    "however , among these 19 class  0 objects , half now host upwards of 2  mmsn , increased three - fold over the equivalent population within class  i. this continues the trend of finding more substantial discs at each earlier phase studied , and is very promising for forming many future planetary systems . *",
    "if these larger dust masses at the class  0 stage represent most closely a true ` initial mass reservoir ' for planet formation , then the small quantities observed during classes i , fs and ii suggest that dust has been converted into larger pebbles and boulders , and perhaps planetesimals if core accretion has proceded successfully . in the grain growth models of @xcite ,",
    "metre - sized boulders are abundant by ages of a few @xmath3 years , i.e. in the class i stage , and planetesimals can aggregate into planetary cores over a similar timescale @xcite . *      in addition , as the protostar is largely assembled in the class  0 phase , it must for part of this period have much less than its final mass . therefore , as the discs are mostly substantial , @xmath4 can be high , raising the possibility of forming planets by the alternative mechanism where gravitational instability leads to disc fragmentation . to attempt to quantify this",
    ", we estimate masses for the protostars assuming that the bolometric luminosity is supplied by the energy released in infall . the accretion rate is taken to be @xmath5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 , i , e , building most of an @xmath8 star in about 0.1  myr @xcite .",
    "the mass of the protostar @xmath9 is then derived from @xmath10 , taking @xmath11 to be @xmath12 after @xcite .",
    "the protostellar radii have not been measured but for pre - main - sequence phases should be moderately independent of mass @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 values may be uncertain by factors up to a few , as disc opacities , stellar radii and accretion rates are not known for individual systems .",
    "the estimates in table  3 suggest that half of the discs should be unstable to fragmentation , with @xmath4 of roughly 0.3 or more . in four cases",
    ", the disc appears to actually out - weigh the star , as in some models of @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses are low , as expected if the stars are not yet fully built .",
    "the protostars estimated to be the most massive also tend to have higher - mass discs , as do the objects in binary systems ( i.e. names ending in a , b , n or s ) .",
    "however , most of the short - wavelength data happens to be for the single systems , so these could simply have disc masses that are under - estimated due to dust opacity .",
    "one problem with the idea of forming planets early on via disc fragmentation is that theoretical calculations , both semi - analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite , suggest that planetary mass bodies will not form inside @xmath13  au .",
    "it is likely that these extremely massive class  0 discs would instead become globally unstable @xcite , moving large amounts of mass to large radii , where fragmentation could produce substellar , or even stellar , mass companions @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of spiral structures in the massive disc could help to collect together solid particles @xcite and thus accelerate planet formation via the mechanism of core accretion .",
    "thus massive discs at very early times may still be a promising signpost to abundant planetary systems around mature main - sequence stars .",
    "the compilation of millimetre data for circumstellar discs in 1 - 2  myr - old star formation regions confirms that the * observable * mass reservoirs are small , at these snapshots in time .",
    "the fraction of discs * apparently * capable of forming gas giants by core accretion is generically less than the fraction of observed exo - planet systems .",
    "an early start to planetary growth is favoured , as the fractions of exo - planets and suitable proto - planetary discs do match in the class  i stage .",
    "we also considered other solutions to the ` missing mass ' problem .",
    "sweeping up the disc material efficiently into planets has both observational and theoretical difficulties .",
    "more promisingly , viscous evolution through disc self - gravity could produce a central concentration of mass that would be optically thick even in the millimetre , and so essentially invisible . at very early times",
    "( class  0 ) , the discs are both massive and at a high mass - fraction with respect to the star , so growth into larger bodies could even start at this very early phase when the star is only part - completed . in conclusion ,",
    "most of the * dust discs seen around class  ii classical t  tauri stars are too insubstantial for commencing to grow planets , and so these should be relics , in the sense that the initial mass reservoir in dust grains has already been converted to larger forms with little millimetre emission .",
    "this growth process around a particular star could have reached anywhere from small rocks up to planetesimals or even completed gas giant planets , especially if the rapid disc instability mechanism operates . *",
    "we thank stfc and supa for support , and kenny wood for insightful remarks that inspired the early stages of this project .",
