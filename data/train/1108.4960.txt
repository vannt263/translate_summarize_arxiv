    "disk turbulence plays a key role in the outward transport of angular momentum that permits disk accretion .",
    "two main sources of disk turbulence are gravitational instability @xcite and magnetic instability due to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the magnetic instability to operate , a critical level of ionization is required for the gas to couple strongly enough to the magnetic field . in certain situations ,",
    "a nonturbulent , high density , cool , weakly ionized disk layer known as a dead zone , can become gravitationally unstable , while remaining magnetically stable @xcite .",
    "the gravitational instability can lead to turbulent heating , resulting in increased ionization of the gas .",
    "the ionization can then trigger the magnetic instability , causing a much higher level of disk turbulence and accretion , an outburst .",
    "after an outburst , the remaining disk gas cools and is replenished by accreting gas from larger radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outburst then repeats at later times in an approximately periodic manner .",
    "such behavior provides a possible model for fu ori outbursts in young stars .",
    "the gravitational instability is thought to be a natural outcome of dead zones in a layered disk , regions where the disk is nonturbulent near the disk mid - plane , but turbulent due to the mri near the disk surface @xcite .",
    "the surface disk turbulence occurs as a consequence of surface ionization by external sources of ionization , such as cosmic rays or x - rays , that then permit the mri to operate @xcite . in a layered region containing a dead zone ,",
    "steady state accretion is generally not possible and the dead zone gains mass from some of the accretion flow near the disk surface .",
    "as mass builds up in the dead zone , it can become self - gravitating . as discussed above ,",
    "the self - gravitating state is turbulent and can trigger a disk outburst .",
    "the purpose of this _ letter _ is to describe the disk outburst cycle in terms of transitions between steady state configurations of an accretion disk .",
    "we determine the limit cycle for the outbursts in a diagram that plots the mass accretion rate @xmath0 versus disk surface density @xmath1 .",
    "a similar approach was taken to explain the disk instability in dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "the dwarf nova thermal - viscous instability can be understood by the s - shaped curve of steady state configurations in such a diagram . in this paper , we determine an analogous curve for outbursts in layered disks with gravitational and magnetic sources of turbulence .",

    "the cycle tracks along steady state branches of the disk solutions and along the dead zone branch",
    ". the cycle jumps between states of low and high accretion rates at the initiation and termination of an outburst .",

    "the thermal - viscous instability could be triggered at smaller radii than the gm instability .",
    "the interaction between the two instabilities may produce some interesting behavior applicable to t tauri stars .",
    "the role of the thermal - viscous instability and its s - curve has been considered by @xcite and @xcite .    following previous work ( armitage et al . 2001 ) , we have taken a rather small value for the viscosity in the active regions of @xmath72 and a large value for the depth of the surface magnetic turbulence of @xmath73 .",

    "we have assumed that the turbulent viscosity associated with self - gravity , @xmath78 , depends on the toomre @xmath79 parameter .",

    "the final disk @xmath79 value is found to be self - regulated at a value @xmath81 .",
    "we have neglected external heating of the disk and assumed that the accretional heating dominates . for the parameters associated with the gm instability in fig 2",
    ", this assumption may be valid .",
    "however , more generally external heating should be considered .",
    "the use of a fixed value for the maximum depth of nonthermal ionization of the outer magnetic layers , @xmath58 , is an approximation .",
    "a more accurate approach to apply a critical magnetic reynolds number required for the mri to operate , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have taken a single critical temperature for thermal ionization @xmath13 at the disk mid - plane temperature above which the disk becomes mri turbulent at all heights . instead",
    ", there may be a thin turbulent layer near the disk mid - plane that develops at this mid - plane temperature that increases in thickness at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "several authors have suggested that there is a small but non - zero turbulent viscosity in the dead zone that develops as a response to turbulence driven in the magnetic surface layers @xcite .",
    "the range of steady state disk flow solutions is then increased ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to some extent , this effect will stabilize the outbursts as material can flow through the ( nearly ) dead zone .",
    "however , there may be issues with the model if the rate of flow through the dead zone approaches that through the magnetic surface layer .",
