    "<S> we consider extensions of the standard model based on open strings ending on d - branes , with gauge bosons due to strings attached to stacks of d - branes and chiral matter due to strings stretching between intersecting d - branes . assuming that the fundamental string mass scale is in the tev range and the theory is weakly coupled , we review possible signals of string physics at the large hadron collider .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.015 cm    at the time of its formulation and for years thereafter , superstring theory was regarded as a unifying framework for planck - scale quantum gravity and tev - scale standard model ( sm ) physics . </S>",
    "<S> important advances were fueled by the realization of the vital role played by d - branes  @xcite in connecting string theory to phenomenology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has permitted the formulation of string theories with compositeness setting in at tev scales and large extra dimensions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> tev - scale superstring theory provides a brane - world description of the sm , which is localized on membranes extending in @xmath0 spatial dimensions ( here taken to be flat ) , the so - called d - branes . </S>",
    "<S> gauge interactions emerge as excitations of open strings with endpoints attached on the d - branes , whereas gravitational interactions are described by closed strings that can propagate in all nine spatial dimensions of string theory ( these comprise flat parallel dimensions extended along the @xmath1-branes and transverse dimensions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent weakness of gravity at energies below few tevs can then be understood as a consequence of the gravitational force `` leaking '' into the transverse compact dimensions of spacetime .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two paramount phenomenological consequences for tev scale d - brane string physics : the emergence of regge recurrences at parton collision energies @xmath2 and the presence of one or more additional @xmath3 gauge symmetries , beyond the @xmath4 of the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the latter follows from the property that the gauge group for open strings terminating on a stack of @xmath5 identical d - branes is @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge group can be @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the simplectic representation of weinberg - salam @xmath11 reduces the required number of higgs doublets to generate all yukawa couplings at tree level  @xcite . ] in this brief review we exploit both these properties in order to identify `` new physics '' signals at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    </S>",
    "<S> only one assumption is necessary in order to set up a solid framework : the string coupling must be small in order to rely on perturbation theory in the computations of scattering amplitudes . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> black hole production and other strong gravity effects occur at energies above the string scale ; therefore at least a few lowest regge recurrences are available for examination , free from interference with some complex quantum gravitational phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a small string coupling , the values of standard model coupling constants are determined by d - brane configurations and the properties of extra dimensions , hence that part of superstring theory requires intricate model - building ; however , as argued in  @xcite , some basic properties of regge resonances like their production rates and decay widths are completely model - independent .    to develop our program in the simplest way </S>",
    "<S> , we will work within the construct of a minimal model in which we consider scattering processes which take place on the ( color ) @xmath12 stack of d - branes . in the bosonic sector , the open strings terminating on this stack contain , in addition to the @xmath13 octet of gluons @xmath14 , an extra @xmath3 boson ( @xmath15 , in the notation of  @xcite ) , most simply the manifestation of a gauged baryon number symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 boson @xmath16 , which gauges the usual electroweak hypercharge symmetry , is a linear combination of @xmath15 , the @xmath3 boson @xmath17 terminating on a separate @xmath3 brane , and perhaps a third additional @xmath3 sharing a @xmath10 brane which is also a terminus for the @xmath18 electroweak gauge bosons </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> any vector boson @xmath20 , orthogonal to the hypercharge , must grow a mass @xmath21 in order to avoid long range forces between baryons other than gravity and coulomb forces . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous mass growth allows the survival of global baryon number conservation , preventing fast proton decay  @xcite . in what follows , </S>",
    "<S> the first regge excitations of the gluon , quarks , and the extra @xmath3 boson tied to the color stack will be denoted by @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical processes underlying dijet production at the lhc are the collisions of two partons @xmath24 , producing two final partons @xmath25 that fragment into hadronic jets . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath26 scattering amplitudes @xmath27 , computed at the leading order in string perturbation theory , are collected in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes involving four gluons as well as those with two gluons plus two quarks do not depend on the compactification details of the transverse space .. then , because of the require correspondence with field theory , the phenomenological results are independent of the compactification of the transverse space . </S>",
    "<S> however , a different phenomenology would result as a consequence of warping one or more parallel dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] all string effects are encapsulated in these amplitudes in one `` form factor '' function of mandelstam variables @xmath28 ( constrained by @xmath29 ) @xmath30 the physical content of the form factor becomes clear after using the well - known expansion in terms of @xmath31-channel resonances  @xcite : @xmath32,\\label{bexp}\\ ] ] which exhibits @xmath31-channel poles associated to the propagation of virtual regge excitations with masses @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> thus near the @xmath34th level pole @xmath35 : @xmath36 in specific amplitudes , the residues combine with the remaining kinematic factors , reflecting the spin content of particles exchanged in the @xmath31-channel , ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes for the four - fermion processes like quark - antiquark scattering are more complicated because the respective form factors describe not only the exchanges of regge states but also of heavy kaluza - klein ( kk ) and winding states with a model - dependent spectrum determined by the geometry of extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , they are suppressed , for two reasons . first , the qcd @xmath13 color group factors favor gluons over quarks in the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> second , the parton luminosities in proton - proton collisions at the lhc , at the parton center of mass energies above  1 tev , are significantly lower for quark - antiquark subprocesses than for gluon - gluon and gluon - quark  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the collisions of valence quarks occur at higher luminosity ; however , there are no regge recurrences appearing in the @xmath31-channel of quark - quark scattering  @xcite .    in the following we isolate the contribution to the partonic cross section from the first resonant state . </S>",
    "<S> note that far below the string threshold , at partonic center of mass energies @xmath39 , the form factor @xmath40  @xcite and therefore the contributions of regge excitations are strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath31-channel pole terms of the average square amplitudes contributing to dijet production at the lhc can be obtained from the general formulae given in  @xcite , using eq.([nthpole ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath69 mixing coefficient is model dependent : in the minimal @xmath70 model it is quite small , around @xmath71 for couplings evaluated at the @xmath72 mass , which is modestly enhanced to @xmath73 as a result of rg running of the couplings up to 2.5  tev . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that in models possessing an additional @xmath3 which partners @xmath18 on a @xmath10 brane , the various assignment of the charges can result in values of @xmath67 which can differ considerably from @xmath74    before proceeding we pause to stress that at low energies @xmath75 the absence of massless poles , at @xmath76 _ etc . </S>",

    "<S> virtual kk graviton emission ( @xmath81 ) involves emission of closed strings , resulting in an additional suppression of order @xmath82 compared to @xmath83 emission . a careful discussion of this suppression is given in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in some scenarios compensation for this suppression can arise from the large multiplicity of graviton emission , which is somewhat dependent on the cutoff mechanism  @xcite . ignoring the @xmath72-mass ( i.e. , keeping only transverse @xmath72 s ) , the quiver contribution to @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> is suppressed relative to the @xmath85 by a factor of @xmath86    the first regge recurrence would be visible in data binned according to the invariant mass @xmath87 of the final state , after setting cuts on rapidities @xmath88 and transverse momenta @xmath89  gev , where @xmath90 for photons and @xmath91 for jets . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd background is calculated at the partonic level making use of the cteq6d parton distribution functions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> standard bump - hunting methods , such as obtaining cumulative cross sections , @xmath92 , from the data and searching for regions with significant deviations from the qcd background , may reveal an interval of @xmath87 suspected of containing a bump . with the establishment of such a region , </S>",
    "<S> one may calculate a signal - to - noise ratio , with the signal rate estimated in the invariant mass window @xmath93.$ ] the noise is defined as the square root of the number of background events in the same dijet mass interval for the same integrated luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the lhc discovery reach ( at the parton level ) is encapsulated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure ] . </S>",
    "<S> the solid , dot - dashed , and dashed lines show the behavior of the signal - to - noise ( s@xmath94 ) ratio as a function of the string scale for three different event topologies ( dijet , @xmath95 jet , and @xmath96 jet ; respectively ) , at @xmath97  tev with an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that with 100  fb@xmath98 of data collection , _ string scales as large as 6.8  tev are open to discovery at the  @xmath99 level . </S>",
    "<S> _ although the discovery reach is not as high as that for dijets , the measurement of @xmath100 jet and @xmath101 jet can potentially provide an interesting corroboration for the stringy origin for new physics manifest as a resonant structure in lhc data . </S>",
    "<S> the stars in fig .  [ figure ] show the expected s / n of dijet events for the first lhc run , at @xmath102  tev . for @xmath103  tev and 100  pb@xmath98 of data collected at @xmath102  tev , we expect s@xmath104 for an overly conservative assumption of integrated luminosity @xmath105 10  pb@xmath98 , a s@xmath106 is expected for string scales as high as @xmath107  tev . </S>",
    "<S> it is also remarkable that within 1 year of data collection at @xmath102  tev , _ string scales as large as 3  tev are open to discovery at the @xmath108 level . </S>",

    "<S> _    we now turn to the analysis of the angular distributions . qcd parton - parton cross sections are dominated by @xmath109-channel exchanges that produce dijet angular distributions which peak at small center of mass scattering angles . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , non  standard contact interactions or excitations of resonances result in a more isotropic distribution . in terms of rapidity variables for standard transverse momentum cuts , dijets resulting from qcd processes will preferentially populate the large rapidity region , while the new processes generate events more uniformly distributed in the entire rapidity region . to analyze the details of the rapidity space </S>",
    "<S> the dcollaboration  @xcite introduced a new parameter @xmath110 , the ratio of the number of events , in a given dijet mass bin , for both rapidities @xmath111 and both rapidities @xmath112 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure ] we compare the results from a full cms detector simulation of the ratio @xmath110  @xcite , with predictions from lo qcd and model - independent contributions to the @xmath53 , @xmath52 and @xmath23 excitations  @xcite . for an integrated luminosity of 10  fb@xmath98 </S>",
    "<S> the lo qcd contributions with @xmath113 ( corresponding to running scale @xmath114 ) are within statistical fluctuations of the full cms detector simulation . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that the string scale is an optimal choice of the running scale which should normally minimize the role of higher loop corrections . ) since one of the purposes of utilizing nlo calculations is to fix the choice of the running coupling , we take this agreement as rationale to omit loops in qcd and in string theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure ] that incorporating nlo calculation of the background and the signal would not significantly change the large deviation of the string contribution from the qcd background . </S>",
    "<S> very recently the cms collaboration optimized the dijet ratio  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the new ratio , @xmath115 is shown in fig .  [ figure ] ; string scales @xmath116  tev can be probed with 100  pb@xmath98 of data collection .    </S>",
    "<S> although there are no @xmath31-channel resonances in @xmath117 and @xmath118 scattering , kk modes in the @xmath109 and @xmath119 channels generate calculable effective 4-fermion contact terms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these in turn are manifest in an enhancement in the continuum below the string scale of the @xmath110 ratio for dijet events . for @xmath120  tev </S>",
    "<S> , this contribution can be detected at the lhc with 6@xmath121 significance above sm background  @xcite . in combination with the simultaneous observation in dijet events of a string resonance at @xmath122 </S>",
    "<S> , this would consolidate the stringy interpretation of these anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it could serve to differentiate between a stringy origin for the resonance as opposed to an isolated structure such as a @xmath123 , which would not modify @xmath110 outside the resonant region . moreover , because of the high multiplicity of the angular momenta ( up to @xmath59 ) , the rapidity distribution of the decay products of string excitations would differ significantly from those following decay of a @xmath123 with @xmath124 . with high statistics , isolation of lowest massive regge excitations from kk replicas ( with @xmath59 ) may also be possible .    in terms of the perturbative cross section itself , </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity of levels that one excites is limited because the scattering takes place on a particular brane from a particular helicity state . for level @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , the regge trajectory has access to @xmath34 spins . for fixed @xmath54 the coupling of the heavier string resonance modes @xmath125 decreases quadratically with energy  @xcite , but the number of modes at each mass level @xmath34 grows also quadratically . </S>",
    "<S> this makes @xmath126 a constant independent of @xmath34 and so the cross section grows linearly with energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the d - brane structure with scattering confined to a single stack of d - branes may not be a valid assumption for the decay of higher mass level excitated states , because there may be branching into a high multiplicity of two resonances which connect to different branes . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the width of the regge excitations will grow at least linearly with energy , whereas the spacing between levels will decrease with energy . </S>",
    "<S> this implies an upper limit on the domain of validity for this phenomenological approach . in particular , for a resonance @xmath110 of mass @xmath87 , the total width @xmath127 , where @xmath128 because of the growing multiplicity of decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the level spacing at mass @xmath87 is @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath130 for excitation of the resonance @xmath110 via @xmath131 , the assumption @xmath132 ( which underestimates the real width ) yields a perturbative regime for @xmath133  @xcite . for an increase width , the transition level can easily drop to @xmath134 .    </S>",
    "<S> black hole intermediate states are expected to dominate @xmath31-channel scattering at trans - planckian energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the number of such non - perturbative states grows faster than that of any perturbative state ; e.g. , the number of black hole states in 10 spacetime dimensions grows with mass like @xmath135 , whereas the number of perturbative string states grows like @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> along these lines , if @xmath137 , semiclassical arguments seem to indicate that black hole production and evaporation would be observed at the lhc  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath138 , the lhc black holes would become stringy ( a.k.a . </S>",
    "<S> `` string balls '' ) and their properties rather complex . </S>",
    "<S> string ball dynamics is framed on the context of the string @xmath139 black hole correspondence principle : when the size of the black hole horizon drops below the size of the fundamental string length , an adiabatic transition occurs to an excited string state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the string will slowly lose mass by radiating massless particles with a nearly thermal spectrum at the unchanging hagedorn temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the continuity of the cross section at the correspondence point , at least parametrically in energy and string coupling , provides independent supportive argument for this picture  @xcite .    _ in summary , _ in d - brane constructions , the full - fledged string amplitudes supplying the dominant contributions to dijet cross sections are completely independent of the details of compactification . </S>",
    "<S> if the string scale is in the tev range , such extensions of the standard model can be of immediate phenomenological interest . in this brief review </S>",
    "<S> we have made use of the amplitudes evaluated near the first resonant pole to report on the discovery potential at the lhc for the first regge excitations of the quark and gluon . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , after a few years of running , the reach of lhc in the dijet topology ( @xmath140 ) can be as high as 6.8  tev . </S>",
    "<S> this intersects with the range of string scales consistent with correct weak mixing angle found in the @xmath141 quiver model  @xcite . for string scales as high as 5.0 tev , observations of resonant structures in @xmath142 jet can provide interesting corroboration for stringy physics at the tev - scale . </S>"
