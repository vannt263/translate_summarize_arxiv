    "since the first discovery of anomalous heat conduction in 1d fermi - pasta - ulam @xmath0 ( fpu-@xmath0 ) lattices where thermal conductivity diverges with the lattice size  @xcite , enormous efforts have been put forward to the study of heat transport in 1d nonintegrable lattices trying to unravel the underlying physical mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the consensus reached in this community is that the total momentum conservation do play an important role in determining the system s heat conduction behavior . for momentum - nonconserving nonintegrable lattices with on - site potentials ,",
    "there is no dispute that they should have normal heat conduction .",
    "however , for momentum - conserving nonintegrable lattices , the issue whether they should necessarily give rise to anomalous heat conduction is still under severe debate .",
    "the hydrodynamic theory has predicted that momentum conservation will naturally induce anomalous heat conduction in 1d nonintegrable lattices  @xcite .",
    "but this theory fails to explain the normal heat conduction numerically found for the rotor model which is also a momentum conserving lattice  @xcite .",
    "there are some arguments that the 1d rotor model should exhibit anomalous heat conduction in thermodynamical limit where approval or disapproval is very hard to be performed by numerical simulations due to huge computation cost  @xcite .",
    "most recently , the normal or anomalous heat transport in asymmetrical momentum conserving lattices has attracted much attention  @xcite , but more studies in this new issue need to be done when a final conclusion can be drawn . for a thorough comprehension of the heat transport problems in low dimensional systems , please refer to some excellent review articles for further reading  @xcite .",
    "despite that the study of normal / anomalous heat conduction or size - dependent thermal conductivities is still causing many troubles for this community , the exploration of temperature dependence of thermal conductivities in 1d nonintegrable lattices turns out to be more successful .",
    "the difficulty of study on size dependence arises from the fact that numerical simulations on extremely long lattices need to be calculated in order to reach the asymptotic behavior .",
    "in contrast , a very short lattice usually in the number of hundreds or thousands atoms is enough to obtain stable temperature dependence of thermal conductivities  @xcite .",
    "the most important thing is that the diversity of temperature dependence for various lattice models can provide perfect testbed for any heat conduction theory , especially some kind of phenomenological theory .",
    "according to numerical simulations , the thermal conductivities of fpu-@xmath0 lattice depend on temperature as @xmath1 in the low temperature limit and @xmath2 in the high temperature limit  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 models have monotonically ascending temperature dependence for thermal conductivities as @xmath4  @xcite , while the hard - kg lattices exhibit monotonically descending temperature dependence as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the exponent of the on - site potential  @xcite .",
    "interesting enough , all these temperature dependence can be _ quantitatively _ and _ consistently _ interpreted by the same phenomenological effective phonon theory  @xcite which is based on the renormalized phonons  @xcite occurred in nonlinear lattices .    in this work , we would like to extend the analytical and numerical investigations of temperature dependence of thermal conductivities to several soft - kg lattices with @xmath7 .",
    "the spectra of renormalized phonons will be numerically calculated in comparison to the predictions from classical field theory .",
    "the temperature - dependent thermal conductivities will be systematically studied via non - equilibrium molecular dynamics .",
    "consistent and quantitative comparison between numerical simulations and theoretical predictions from effective phonon theory will be performed .",
    "the paper is organized as the follows : in sec .",
    "ii the soft - kg lattice models will be introduced and the properties of renormalized phonons will be presented .",
    "iii will then display the results of temperature - dependent thermal conductivities and their comparison with the theoretical predictions from effective phonon theory .",
