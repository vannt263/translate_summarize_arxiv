    "with the foreseen improvements in theoretical techniques for form factor calculations , measurement of exclusive @xmath0 processes shows promise as the most robust route for determination of @xmath2 .",
    "the experiments babar , belle and cleo now have a variety of measurements , preliminary or published , of such processes .",
    "while the experiments employ a variety of strategies , the core techniques are similar and lead to potential correlations . with the current information available from the experiments , realistic evaluation of the correlations and , therefore , robust averaging of the results is very difficult .",
    "this review surveys areas in which correlated systematic uncertainties are likely to exist for the measurements .",
    "i pose a set of `` homework '' questions .",
    "these can hopefully serve as a starting point for discussion among the experiments aimed at standardized evaluation of uncertainties where correlations are likely to exist .    as discussed in any reference concerning exclusive @xmath3 transitions ,",
    "the major theoretical uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath2 from these transitions arises from uncertainties in the hadronic form factors involved in the transitions ( see , for example , @xcite ) . for electron and muon transitions",
    ", one form factor dominates transitions to final states with a single pseudoscalar meson , and three form factors dominate those to a single vector meson .",
    "all of these form factors vary as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath4 .",
    "i will review mechanisms leading from uncertainties in the form factors to uncertainty in the branching fractions and in @xmath2 .",
    "an excellent overview of the status of the theoretical work on the form factors can be found in the proceedings of the previous ckm workshop @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite also makes a valiant start towards an average of the various experimental results .",
    "better standardization among the experiments will be necessary to effect a more robust averaging procedure .",
    "table  [ tab : measurements ] summarizes the measurements of exclusive @xmath1 channels that have been published or presented in preliminary form at conferences .",
    "all the measurements have made use of detector hermeticity to obtain an initial estimate the four momentum of the neutrino . at babar , belle and cleo ,",
    "the initial four momentum of the @xmath5 is known very well . since the detectors cover most of the total @xmath6 solid angle , the missing four momentum , defined via @xmath7 provides a good estimate of the total four momentum of all undetected particles in the event . for events with just one undetected neutrino from @xmath0 ,",
    "the missing four momentum provides a good estimate of the neutrino s four momentum .",
    "one of the challenges facing `` reconstruction '' of the neutrino in this fashion lies in appropriate selection of the tracks and showers used in the sums .",
    "the babar 01 analysis , for example , selects the subset of tracks @xmath8 mev@xmath9 , at least 12 hits in their drift chamber , and consistent with coming from the origin .",
    "the cleo analyses have optimized track selection for hermeticity in two ways . for contributions to the missing momentum , cleo attempts to identify one and only one reconstructed track per true particle from the origin ( taking `` poorly measured '' in preference to `` not measured '' ) .",
    "selection of tracks to be matched to hadronic showers in the calorimeter is performed separately .",
    "for example , particles with transverse momentum low enough to `` curl '' within the detector may result in several reconstructed tracks .",
    "cleo groups these tracks and chooses the likeliest best representation of the original particle . for particles that decay in flight or suffer a hard scatter or a hadronic interaction ,",
    "cleo identifies the inner and outer tracks for the two different purposes .",
    "similarly , the experiments have a range of selection criteria of showers in the electromagnetic calorimeter to separate true photons from showers originating with interactions of charged hadrons .    .published and preliminary @xmath0 measurements .",
    "the years correspond to year of publication , year of submission for publication , or year of presentation for identification purposes and are _ not _ indicative of the intellectual history . for example , the preliminary version of cleo 03 and of belle 02 appeared simultaneously . [",
    "cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     all of the analyses performed to date rely on detector hermeticity to provide an estimate of the neutrino momentum and , as a result , more robust background suppression .",
    "the price to be paid is an enhancement of the systematic uncertainties from physics and detector simulation .",
    "a systematic uncertainty in the tracking efficiency , for example , acts coherently over all charged particles in an event . since there are typically about ten charged particles per @xmath10 event at the @xmath5 ) , single track effects can get magnified dramatically .",
    "_ a priori _ it is difficult to predict how correlated the systematics will be and how they will vary from experiment to experiment .",
    "the systematic effects tend to affect both background levels and efficiency , so the effects could vary quite significantly among the measurements depending on the optimization of efficiency versus background level .",
    "the hermeticity  related systematic categories considered by the cleo 03 analysis are tabulated in table  [ tab : hermsyst ] . because detector simulation in the experiments tend to rely on a common geant base , or even more fundamentally , on a common pool of cross section measurements , many of the categories are likely",
    "to be at least partially correlated among the experiments .",
    "cleo has found , for example , measurable differences between data and simulation for hadronic interactions of kaons in its cesium  iodide ( csi ) calorimeter .",
    "these studies provide the input for the @xmath11 shower simulation listed in the table .",
    "while babar and belle may be less susceptible to these effects because of their instrumented flux returns , this could remain a sizable , strongly correlated systematic .",
    "cleo has also found that data and simulation disagree on the energy deposited in charged hadronic showers at distances too large to veto using proximity to a projected track .",
    "the resulting systematic contributions in the production of such `` splitoffs '' and in the variables used to reject them appear , fortunately , to be rather small .",
    "they are , however , also likely to be significantly correlated among experiments , so could result in a non - negligible contribution to an experimental average .    the cleo tracking system and its associated uncertainties have been intensively studied at cleo . as a result ,",
    "the individual track  finding efficiency has been limited in studies at the @xmath12 level .",
    "the cleo 03 analysis has used @xmath13 per track in table  [ tab : hermsyst ] to be conservative .",
    "even at this small rate , the track efficiency uncertainty becomes sizable when coherently amplified by all tracks in the event . at @xmath12 level , the uncertainty in the tracking efficiency studies that provided that limit are similar to the uncertainty in total number of interaction lengths in the tracking system because of uncertainties in the underlying cross sections .    at a smaller level in the cleo analysis",
    "are the uncertainties in the @xmath11 production spectrum and rate and in the @xmath14 production spectrum and rate ( particularly from the secondary production process @xmath15 ) from the @xmath5 .",
    "the production models tend to be strongly correlated among experiments through common event generators , so these categories still merit some attention .",
    "other systematics in the list may also be correlated , such as the photon resolution resulting from a common model of electromagnetic showers . typically in measurements",
    "many of these effects are small . however , with the amplification from the use of hermeticity , the experiments should evaluate with some care the levels of uncertainty and the levels of correlation among experiments for a broad variety of detector effects .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what is the complete set of systematics related to generic production model and detector simulation that are significant at the few percent level for the exclusive @xmath3 analyses ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ what is the level of correlation among the experiments for these different systematic effects ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _      the literature now teems with calculations of the form factors involved in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 transitions . for a relatively recent survey ,",
    "see the references within reference  @xcite .",
    "this review will limit itself to those considered within the analyses to date .",
    "these include a variety of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations from ape ( ape 00 ) @xcite , fnal ( fnal 01 ) @xcite , jlqcd ( jlqcd 01 ) @xcite , and ukqcd ( ukqcd 98 and ukqcd 99 ) @xcite and light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) calculations from ball and collaborators ( ball 98 and ball 01 ) @xcite and khodjamirian and collaborators ( krwwy ) @xcite .",
    "both approaches currently have uncertainties in the @xmath18 to @xmath19 range .",
    "also incorporated into various analyses are the quark model calculations of isgur _ et al _ ( isgw  ii ) @xcite , feldman and kroll ( spd ) @xcite , and the relativistic quark model calculation of melikhov and stech @xcite .",
    "as they are purely models , it is difficult to assign a meaningful uncertainty to the quark model calculations .",
    "finally , the analysis of ligeti and wise @xcite based on study of heavy quark symmetry and measured @xmath20 form factors is often considered .    to    a rate measurement suffers from significant theoretical uncertainties when the experimental efficiency varies significantly over the variables on which the form factor , or combination of form factors ,",
    "depend . to clarify the problem ,",
    "consider the @xmath16 transition , for which a variety of form factor calculations are shown in figure  [ fig : pi_models ] .",
    "the models were selected to indicate the span of @xmath21 dependence that arises in the literature : a significant variation in the case of @xmath16 . since there is a single form factor that dominates the dynamics for this mode ( in the limit of massless leptons ) , the @xmath22 distribution contains all of the dynamical information . if an analysis ( a ) integrates over a broad @xmath21 interval and ( b ) imposes selection criteria that cause a significant efficiency variation , then a significant variation in the form factors will cause a significant variation in the weighting of low ",
    "efficiency versus high ",
    "efficiency @xmath21 regions . as a result ,",
    "the overall efficiency prediction will vary dramatically , leading to significant theoretical uncertainty .",
    "a variety of effects can lead to a @xmath21dependent efficiency .",
    "all analyses , for example , require a minimum lepton momentum , which results in the reconstruction efficiency falling as @xmath21 with @xmath21 ( sloped light blue line in figure  [ fig : pi_models ] .",
    "the higher the minimum momentum , the steeper the efficiency slope becomes .",
    "to    a more subtle situation can arise from methods of continuum background suppression .",
    "the continuum background naturally reconstructs at low @xmath21 . to achieve a large beam  constrained mass ( near @xmath23 )",
    ", the kinematics favor the selection of a meson ( in this case a pion ) from one jet and a lepton pair from a semileptonic decay in the opposite jet ( see figure  [ fig : topology ] ) .",
    "interpreted as an @xmath5 event , the @xmath24 pair has a small invariant mass , and hence the @xmath16 candidate decay appears to have low @xmath21 .",
    "this topology , unfortunately , mimics that of a true @xmath5 event containing a @xmath25 decay at low @xmath21 ( figure  [ fig : topology ] ) .",
    "continuum background suppression techniques based on variables that characterize the event _ shape _ generally introduce a significant bias into signal reconstruction efficiency versus @xmath21 . requiring the ratio of the second to zeroth fox ",
    "wolfram moments , @xmath26 , to be small ( spherical topology ) introduces such a bias .",
    "variables characterizing the momentum flow relative to the lepton momentum direction , while providing powerful continuum suppression , severely bias the reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the efficiency curve that falls steeply at low @xmath21 in figure  [ fig : pi_models ] characterizes the effect of lepton  based suppression .",
    "fortunately , continuum suppression can be realized without introducing any bias into the reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the angle between the thrust or sphericity axes for the candidate event and the remainder of the event provides such suppression ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the same considerations hold for other @xmath3 decay modes .",
    "decays to a vector meson can not , of course , be characterized solely by the @xmath22 distribution because of the interference among the three form factors involved in those decays .",
    "analyses can , of course , be optimized to reduce effects from uncertainties in the form factors .",
    "obviously , the looser the selection criteria on lepton momentum and event shape variables that bias the efficiency versus @xmath21 , the smaller the bias .",
    "one can further reduce the form factor uncertainty via extraction of independent rates in separate @xmath21 intervals .",
    "the form factors are then only required to provide relative rates over each restricted @xmath21 interval , and not between the different @xmath21 intervals . as a bonus",
    ", the resulting @xmath22 distribution can be used as a test of the form factor calculations .",
    "the cleo 03 analysis adopts both approaches , and the resulting @xmath21 distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : dgamma ] , along with a variety of calculations .",
    "the @xmath16 mode shows essentially no variation as the form factors are changed .",
    "the @xmath17 mode still exhibits dependence on the form factor calculation .",
    "the branching fractions , obtained by summing the measured rates , show significantly smaller form factor dependence than other measurements ( figure  [ fig : branching_fractions ] ) for both modes . the residual uncertainty in the @xmath17 mode likely results from a cut on the angle between the lepton in the @xmath27 rest frame and the @xmath27 direction and the different effect this has on the three form factors for that decay .",
    "to    cross - feed among @xmath3 modes also exhibits a strong @xmath21 dependence , with the high@xmath21 regions seeing the most background contribution .",
    "this phenomenon is clearly visible in the cross - feed background contribution to @xmath16 in figure  [ fig : cleo_pi ] .",
    "basically , at large @xmath21 , which corresponds to soft mesons , there is a larger probability for random hadronic combinatorics to combine with the lepton pair from a non - signal @xmath3 mode and satisfy the kinematic requirements for the signal mode .",
    "most analyses have not studied variations of the form factors from specific background modes .",
    "the cleo 03 approach of extracting rates in independent @xmath21 intervals has reduced the sensitivity to the form factors relative to the cleo 96 analysis .",

    "note that the quoted theoretical uncertainties on @xmath2 obtained by the experiments are _ not _ directly comparable .",
    "they are evaluated with rather different degrees of conservativeness and analyses with similar sensitivities will appear with differing uncertainties .",
    "independent extraction of rates in the three @xmath21 intervals in the cleo 03 analysis permits extraction of @xmath2 with a method that minimizes unquantifiable modeling assumptions .",

    "however , extrapolation of those calculations outside of the @xmath21 range in which the techniques are valid to the full @xmath21 range involves modeling assumptions that can not be quantified .",

    "many new measurements with new techniques have been presented recently , with more anticipated .",
    "the statistics are now sufficient to permit extraction of @xmath22 with reasonable precision in the decays , which in turn allows reduction of the uncertainty from theoretical form factor shapes on the rates .",
    "measurement of @xmath22 also allows more robust extraction of @xmath2 .",
    "the theoretical prediction on the overall form factor normalization continues to dominate extraction of @xmath2 from the measured rates .",
