    "when we estimate the present star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies , we use the luminosity of radiation from young massive stars as its indicator .",
    "various observational quantities are adopted in order to count the number of photons originating from these stars .",
    "indeed , we use the data of hydrogen recombination lines , ultraviolet ( uv ) , infrared ( ir ) , radio , etc .",
    ", as the indicators of the photon flux and the sfr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observational evidence suggests , however , that star - forming regions are often associated with dust ( e.g. , @xcite , p.  125 ) .",
    "thus , we can not obtain the true sfr of galaxies unless we correct observational data for dust extinction .",
    "in other words , understanding the extinction property is important in estimating the sfr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we should examine the properties of dust extinction in star - forming regions in detail .",
    "the extinction by the interstellar dust from uv ( @xmath6  ) to near - ir ( nir ) has been studied well to date ( e.g. , interstellar extinction curve : @xcite ) . according to those researches",
    ", it is widely accepted that when we estimate the sfr from the h@xmath7 luminosity , for example , we should correct decrement of the line luminosity due to the uv ",
    "nir extinction .",
    "it can be performed by using a proper extinction curve and the observation of the balmer decrement ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "how about the effect of the extinction in the lyman continuum band ?",
    "because of the decrement of the stellar radiation owing to the lyman continuum extinction ( lce ) , we may underestimate the sfr of galaxies . in this paper , this point is extensively examined .    indeed , many observations of h ii regions have revealed that dust grains are associated with these regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this means a very important fact that the lyman continuum photons from the central young massive stars suffer extinction by dust grains within h ii regions . as a result",
    ", the number of lyman continuum photons contributing to hydrogen ionization is reduced . from the intensity of recombination lines or thermal radio radiation , we can only estimate the number of the photons really contributing to the ionization .",
    "therefore , we inevitably underestimate the number of lyman continuum photons and the sfr unless we correct the observational data for the lce by dust .    in studies on each individual h ii region",
    ", it has been reported that a part of lyman continuum photons are absorbed by dust if h ii regions contain dust grains ( e.g. , petrosian , silk , & field 1972 ; @xcite ) . according to @xcite , for instance",
    ", the fraction of lyman continuum photons used by hydrogen ionization is estimated to be 0.26 for the orion nebula .",
    "their result has shown that the chance which the lyman continuum photons are extinguished by dust is significantly large . on a galactic scale ,",
    "smith , biermann , & mezger ( 1978 ) have examined lce by dust for a large number of radio h ii regions in the galaxy , and then , have shown about half lyman continuum photons from exciting stars in many h ii regions are absorbed by dust within these regions .",
    "however , they did not discuss the effect of the lce on estimating the sfr of galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that we often estimate the sfr of galaxies from lyman continuum flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) without any correction of the lce effect .",
    "hence , it is indispensable for us to re - examine lce by dust within h ii regions and to discuss the effect of lce on determining the sfr of galaxies .",
    "first , we formulate the way of estimating the fraction of lyman continuum photons used by hydrogen ionization , and determine the fraction in each individual h ii region of the galaxy in section 2 .",
    "we also present another way for estimating lce by dust in section 3 .",
    "then , we discuss the effect of lce by dust on estimating the galaxy - scale sfr in section 4 .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "the lyman continuum photons from young massive stars in an h ii region are absorbed by dust grains as well as by neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "then , the number of lyman continuum photons contributing to hydrogen ionization , @xmath8 , is smaller than the intrinsic number of lyman continuum photons , @xmath9 .",
    "we parameterize this effect by @xmath1 , which is defined as the fraction of lyman continuum photons contributing to the hydrogen ionization ; @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately , we are able to estimate only @xmath8 from observations of recombination lines or thermal radio continuum .",
    "this means that the `` real '' sfr , which should be estimated from @xmath9 , is @xmath11 times larger than the `` apparent '' sfr estimated from @xmath8 .",
    "hence , if the parameter , @xmath1 , is much smaller than unity , the effect of lce by dust becomes very important to the estimation of the sfr .",
    "we call @xmath11 _ correction factor _ or _ increment factor _ for the sfr . in this section ,",
    "we examine the value of @xmath1 in each individual h ii region in the galaxy to find the correction factor quantitatively .",
    "first , when no dust grains exist in an h ii region , the radius of the region is estimated to be the strmgren radius , @xmath12 . according to @xcite",
    ", we express the number of lyman continuum photons emitted per unit time , @xmath9 , by using the strmgren radius , @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number densities of electrons and protons , respectively , and @xmath16 is the recombination coefficient excluding captures to the @xmath17 level . here",
    ", we employ the case b approximation , which is the assumption that h ii regions are optically thick for the photons of all lyman - emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume spherical symmetry and spatial uniformity of h ii regions in this paper for simplicity .",
    "next , we consider the effect of lce by dust on the size of h ii regions . the actual radius of the ionized region becomes smaller than the strmgren radius in equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) by the lce effect .",
    "when we express the actual ionized radius as @xmath18 , we obtain @xmath19 moreover , if the ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath12 is expressed by @xmath20 , we obtain the following relation from equations  ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , @xmath21    to estimate @xmath1 , we need to find the quantitative relation between @xmath1 and the amount of dust .",
    "we determine @xmath1 in terms of the optical depth of dust for lyman continuum photons . according to @xcite , then",
    ", we define @xmath22 as the optical depth of dust for lyman continuum photons over the strmgren radius in order to formulate the dependence of @xmath1 on the dust - to - gas ratio . here",
    ", @xmath22 is approximated to be the optical depth at the lyman limit ( 912  ) .",
    "when we adopt the galactic extinction curve , the dust extinction at 912   is about 13@xmath23 mag .",
    "thus , @xmath24 .",
    "if we assume that the dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath25 , is proportional to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the column number density of hydrogen , then , according to @xcite and @xcite , @xmath28\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 is estimated with respect to a typical galactic value , @xmath29 . thus , @xmath30    here , we define @xmath27 as the column density over the strmgren radius .",
    "that is , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the volume number density of hydrogen .",
    "therefore , equation  ( [ eq19 ] ) is reduced to @xmath33 where @xmath12 is eliminated by equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) , and we suppose that @xmath34 ( fully ionized in the ionized region ) and that the temperature of h ii regions is @xmath35 k. since we can not observe the real number of lyman continuum photons , @xmath9 , we rewrite equation  ( [ eq18 ] ) in terms of the apparent one , @xmath36 ; @xmath37    in addition , @xcite derived the following relation between @xmath20 and @xmath22 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius normalized by @xmath12 . integrating equation  ( [ eq22 ] ) , we obtain @xmath40 where @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that @xmath41 is identified with the optical depth of dust over the actual ionized radius , @xmath18 . according to equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we finally obtain @xmath44 this is the same as equation  ( 8) in @xcite .",
    "now , once @xmath32 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath8 , and @xmath25 are determined , we derive @xmath46 via equation  ( [ eq20 ] ) , and then , we calculate @xmath1 by using equation  ( [ eq31 ] ) . in figure  1",
    ", we show the @xmath1 vs.  @xmath41 relation obtained from equation  ( [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "which quantity determines @xmath1 the most effectively ? according to figure  1 , decrement of @xmath1 is due to increment of the dust optical depth .",
    "thus , to find the most effective parameter for @xmath1 , let us examine the parameter dependence of the optical depth .",
    "we find in equation  ( 7 ) that the optical depth increases according to the dust - to - gas ratio , lyman continuum flux , and density of hii regions .",
    "then , when any of those three parametes increase , @xmath1 decreases . by the way , among the power indices in equation  ( 7 ) , that of the dust - to - gas ratio is the largest .",
    "then , we find that @xmath1 depends most largely on the dust - to - gas ratio",
    ".    one might think that the effect of helium on the ionization structure of h ii regions is important ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in h ii regions , there are extremely energetic photons whose wavelengths are shorter than 504  .",
    "such photons can ionize neutral helium .",
    "hence , the number of lyman continuum photons absorbed by hydrogen seems to decrease because of the absorption by helium .",
    "however , fortunately , almost all ( 96% according to @xcite ) photons produced by helium recombination can ionize neutral hydrogen .",
    "therefore , we can assume safely that the number of lyman continuum photons does not significantly decrease owing to the presence of helium .",
    "moreover , the fraction of the photons with shorter wavelengths than 504   is small ( 0.14 in our calculation adopting the stellar spectra assumed to be the plank function and salpeter s imf ) .",
    "thus , the effect of helium on the photon count is small in estimating the sfr .",
    "another effect of helium appears on the electron number density .",
    "for example , in the derivation of equation  ( [ eq18 ] ) , we must replace @xmath47 with @xmath48 . since helium abundance is typically 0.1 by number , @xmath49 .",
    "hence , we consider this effect to be less significant than that caused by some other uncertainties , e.g. , the change of the imf .",
    "therefore , we neglect these effects of helium in this paper .",
    "let us estimate @xmath1 for the galactic h ii regions in order to estimate the effect of lce by dust on determining the sfr . to do this , as formulated in the previous subsection , we need the data set of the number of lyman continuum photons , the electron ( or hydrogen ) number density , and the dust - to - gas ratio .    the amount of dust is considered to be related to the metallicity . in this section , we determine the dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath50 , from the observational metallicity ( abundance of oxygen ) for each h ii region , using a global relation between @xmath25 and ( o / h ) proposed and modeled by hirashita ( 1999a , b ) . and @xmath51",
    "here , @xmath52 is the dust mass fraction in the material injected from stars , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined as gas consumption timescale ( gas mass divided by star formation rate ) normalized by dust growth timescale and by dust destruction timescale , respectively ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "] we display in figure  2 the global relation between @xmath25 and @xmath55 .",
    "this is the same as figure  4 of @xcite .",
    "here , we adopt @xmath56 as the solar abundance ( @xcite ) . we should note here that this @xmath25(o / h ) relation is the average relation for the interstellar medium ( ism ) in nearby spirals and dwarfs .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath25(o / h ) relation of h ii regions is not different significantly from the averaged @xmath25(o / h ) of ism . this assumption may not be very good , but the dust properties in h ii regions are still uncertain .",
    "hence , as a first step , we apply the @xmath25(o / h ) relation of the ism to each h ii region .    we make two sets of the suitable samples to estimate @xmath1 of each individual h ii region .",
    "one is the sample of seven representative giant h ii regions in the galaxy .",
    "their properties are summarized in table  1 .",
    "these h ii regions are famous and have been studied well .",
    "thus , the uncertainties of their data , especially their distance ( i.e. , their luminosity ) , can be regarded as small .",
    "their apparent number flux of lyman continuum photons ( @xmath57 ) are estimated from radio observations and more than about @xmath58 s@xmath59 .",
    "hereafter , we call this sample _ luminous _ sample .",
    "the determined @xmath1 values are also shown in column ( 7 ) of table  1 .",
    "we find a good agreement between petrosian et al.s @xmath1 and ours for the orion nebula ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath1 of this sample is 0.35 .",
    "the other sample is a part of h ii regions observed and investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we select the h ii regions whose kinematic distance and photometric distance are consistent within a factor of 1.5 from their sample .",
    "this is because the uncertainty in distance affects the estimation of the number of lyman continuum photons and then prevents us from determining @xmath1 reasonably .",
    "these h ii regions tend to be less luminous than the sample of table  1 and their apparent number flux of lyman continuum photons ( @xmath57 ) are estimated from their h@xmath7 luminosities .",
    "hereafter , the sample is called to _ less luminous _ sample .",
    "their properties are tabulated in table  2 .",
    "@xcite also observed the orion nebula and m16 , both of which are also included in the sample in table  1 , but their h@xmath7 luminosities are smaller than that expected from the radio observations adopted in table  1 .",
    "this is because @xcite did not observe whole parts of these nebulae .",
    "thus , we exclude the orion nebula and m16 from the sample of table  2 .",
    "the finaly determined @xmath1 of the sample distributes over 0.51 , and the mean is 0.8 .    in figures  3 ( a)(f ) , we present several relations among various parameters of our sample h ii regions in tables  1 and 2 .",
    "open symbols are h ii regions in table  1 , and filled symbols are those in table  2 . in the panels of ( a)(c ) , we show some relations among the basic parameters to determine @xmath1 . from these panels , we can check our standpoint for the subsequent considerations .",
    "firstly , we may find , in panel ( a ) , the sample regions with higher metallicity have larger observed lyman continuum flux , @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , the sample correlation coefficient is 0.41 , so that the correlation exists with a confidence level of 95% for the sample .",
    "however , we find no correlation for the sample of table  2 alone .",
    "we also can not find the correlation for the extragalactic h ii regions .",
    "thus , we consider that the correlation in panel ( a ) may be caused by our sample selection .",
    "hence , we assume it conservatively in this paper that @xmath8 dose not depend on the metallicity . in panel ( b ) , the correlation between the metallicity and the electron number density , @xmath14 , is not found .",
    "thus , we dose not consider that @xmath14 depends on the metallicity . in panel",
    "( c ) , interestingly , we can find a correlation between @xmath14 and @xmath8 for only samples in table  2 .",
    "next , in the panels of ( d)(f ) , we present the dependece of @xmath1 on the parameters of h ii regions . the estimated @xmath1 is regarded as a function of the metallicity in panel ( d ) , i.e. , as the metallicity in an h ii region increases , @xmath1 becomes smaller .",
    "this is because , in our formulation , the dust - to - gas ratio ( i.e. , metallicity ) has a positive dependence on the optical depth of dust as shown in equation  ( [ eq20 ] ) , and then , a larger dust content leads to a larger optical depth of dust and smaller @xmath1 .",
    "although the correlation in ( d ) is not the result directly derived via the analysis of the observational quantities , we confirm a trend that @xmath1 depends on the metalicity ( see also hirashita et al .",
    "2001 ) . in panel",
    "( e ) , we also find @xmath1 is related to @xmath8 which has a positive dependence on the dust optical depth ( eq .  [ [ eq20 ] ] ) .",
    "this issue will be discussed again in section 3 .",
    "we can not find a significant correlation in panel ( f ) , probably because @xmath14 has a weak dependence in the dust optical depth ( index 1/3 in eq .",
    "[ [ eq20 ] ] ) and its dynamic range is small relative to @xmath8 which has the same dependence in equation  ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "now , we concentrate on the dependence of the dust - to - gas ratio ( i.e. , metallicity ) on @xmath1 , because the variation of dust - to - gas ratio has the largest influence on determining the dust optical depth as seen in equation  ( [ eq20 ] ) .",
    "that is , we assume that the optical depth of dust is a function of the dust - to - gas ratio only .",
    "if we consider @xmath8 and @xmath14 dose not depend on @xmath61 ( or metallicity ) , we can re - express equation  ( [ eq20 ] ) as @xmath62 where @xmath41 is the dust optical depth over the actual ionized radius ( see section 2.1 ) , and @xmath63 is a factor containing the dependence of @xmath8 and @xmath64 . we find that the best fit value of @xmath63 for the adopted galactic h ii regions is 1.8 , although the dispersion is large . in figure  4 , we display the estimated @xmath1 of the individual h ii region in our sample as a function of its dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath25 .",
    "the open and filled symbols represent the sample of tables  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "this figure is basically identical to figure  3 ( d ) .",
    "the solid line is the best fit line ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "we also show the lines of @xmath66 , and 3.0 for comparisons .    here",
    ", let us discuss the increment factor for the sfr , @xmath11 , which is introduced at the beginning of section [ sec : f_value ] .",
    "it is useful for us and readers to check quantitatively how @xmath1 is affected by @xmath25 . as a representative case",
    ", we consider the model of @xmath67 , which corresponds with @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( nearly equal to the lyman continuum number flux and electron number density of the orion nebula ) .",
    "numerically , from the set of equations ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) , we find @xmath1 to be about 0.2 for @xmath70 ( the typical value of the ism in the galaxy ; @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath25 is 1/3 , 1/10 , or 1/100 of the galactic value , @xmath1 becomes 0.6 , 0.9 , or nearly unity , respectively .",
    "thus , it is found that the increment factor for the sfr , @xmath11 , increases from almost unity to about 5 as @xmath25 increases from @xmath71 ( 1/10 of a typical galactic value ) to @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , the correction factor for the sfr is very sensitive to the dust - to - gas ratio ( or metallicity ) , especially around @xmath72 .",
    "hence , we should determine @xmath25 precisely to find an actual @xmath1 and sfr . in any case",
    ", we must take account of the effect of lce by dust at least for the objects whose metallicity is as high as that of the orion nebula .",
    "@xcite have also determined @xmath1 for a numerous radio sample of giant h ii regions in the galaxy .",
    "although our equation  ( [ eq20 ] ) is equivalent to their equation  ( a.2 ) , there is a difference in the method of determining the dust - to - gas ratio of h ii regions .",
    "indeed , they used an empirical relation of the absorption cross section as a function of the galactocentric radius ( @xcite ) , whereas we determine @xmath25 for each h ii region individually as described above .",
    "the determined mean @xmath1 for the giant h ii regions by @xcite is 0.56 .",
    "since @xmath8 of their sample is larger than @xmath73 , their sample h ii regions correspond to our sample in table  1 , which has mean @xmath74 .",
    "the estimated @xmath1 values by us may be systematically small .",
    "this is due to the differences of some adopted parameters in calculation , for example , @xmath75 . also , @xcite took account of the effect of helium which we neglect as mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "the parameter of @xmath1 in smith et al .",
    "is thus determined as the sum of the fractions of lyman continuum photons absorbed by both hydrogen and helium .",
    "this increment by helium in @xmath1 is about several % ( up to 10% ) in their framework .",
    "if the increment is removed , smith s mean @xmath1 will approach our value .    throughout this section",
    ", we have found that the determination of @xmath25 is very important to estimate the `` real '' sfr ( or @xmath1 ) from an observational count of lyman continuum photons . to obtain @xmath25 accurately , it is a recommendable way that we use the luminosity of ir thermal emission of dust in h ii regions . since dust grains absorb the radiative energy from the young massive stars and then re - emit the energy in the ir range , the amount of dust is determined from the ir luminosity . in the next section , we discuss lce by dust from observation of ir luminosity",
    "in the previous section , we estimate the amount of dust ( the dust - to - gas ratio ) in h ii regions from their metallicity .",
    "since the amount of dust is also reflected in the ir emission , @xmath1 is also determined from ir luminosity independently . in this section , then , we determine @xmath1 by using the ir luminosity of h ii regions in order to check consistency between the results of the previous and the current section .    based on the theory of the ir emission from dust in h ii regions by @xcite , we formulate the relation between the observed ir luminosity , @xmath76 , and the observed number of lyman continuum photons , @xmath8 ( inoue , hirashita , & kamaya 2000 , 2001 ) . the derived formula is @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the average efficiency of the dust absorption for uv  optical photons from ob stars . here , we have also adopted the salpeter s imf ( the stellar mass range is 0.1100 @xmath79 ) and proper stellar properties .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic number of lyman continuum photons , @xmath9 , is @xmath80 per unit solar luminosity of the bolometric luminosity of ob stars , in our calculation . as defined in the previous section , @xmath81 . instead of determining the sed of the ir radiation",
    ", we consider the total ir luminosity of dust , @xmath76 , in the range of 8  1000 @xmath82 m which covers almost the whole wavelength range of dust emission .",
    "first , let us consider the correlation between the luminosities of ir and h@xmath7 for h ii regions .",
    "we make a cross - reference between the sample of @xcite and the _ iras _ point source catalog ( _ iras _ psc ; @xcite ) .",
    "we select the sample h ii regions by the following criteria ; ( a ) the separation between the positions of the h@xmath7 observations and sources in _ iras _ psc is within @xmath83 .",
    "( b ) @xmath84 .",
    "( c ) @xmath85 .",
    "( d ) @xmath86 jy . here ,",
    "@xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 are the _ iras _ fluxes at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath82 m , respectively .",
    "the criterion ( a ) is based on the typical radius of optical h ii regions ( @xmath91 110 pc ) and _ iras _ positional error ( @xmath92 , @xcite ) .",
    "the criteria ( b )  ( d ) are proposed by @xcite .",
    "the confidence level of the set of criteria for true association between _ iras _ sources and h ii regions is more than 80% ( @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain 18 h ii regions ( 10 samples are also in table  2 ) and their properties are found in table  3 .    when we suppose that the dust emission can be fitted by the modified black - body radiation of 30 k ( spectral index is 1 ) , _ iras _ 40  120 @xmath82 m luminosity , @xmath93 , is @xmath94 .",
    "this correction factor is consistent with that of @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath8 is estimated in terms of the h@xmath7 luminosity corrected for interstellar extinction : @xmath95 , where we assume the case b and the electron temperature of @xmath35 k ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ eq40 ] ) is reduced to @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are fluxes of _ iras _ and h@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this is a theoretical relation between @xmath97 and @xmath99 .",
    "since a flux ratio does not depend on the distance to the objects , equation  ( [ eq41 ] ) is free from the uncertainty in the distance .",
    "the average efficiency of dust absorption for uv  optical photons from ob stars , @xmath78 , is defined as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is an average dust absorption over the wavelength range of @xmath102  4000   in units of magnitude .",
    "this range is suitable for our purpose because the number of photons of @xmath103 4000   emitted by ob stars are negligible .",
    "if we adopt the galactic extinction curve ( @xcite ) , then we have @xmath104 .",
    "thus , we obtain the following equation ; @xmath105 using this equation , we find @xmath106 for the h ii regions in table  3 .    once we obtain the value of @xmath78 for each h ii region from equation ( [ eq42 ] ) , we can determine each @xmath1 from ir and h@xmath7 fluxes by using equation  ( [ eq41 ] ) .",
    "we show the estimated @xmath1 in column ( 7 ) of table  3 . by definition ,",
    "however , for some sample h ii regions , @xmath1 appears to be greater than unity .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy will be discussed in the last paragraph of this section .    by the way",
    ", we compare the theoretical @xmath97@xmath98 relation with observational data on the @xmath97 vs.@xmath98 plane in figure  5 . adopting @xmath108",
    ", we make three lines for three values of @xmath1 ; the solid , dotted , and dashed lines for @xmath109 , 0.5 , and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "moreover , we make the dash - dotted line for the set of @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "this corresponds to the case that only the lyman @xmath7 photons are absorbed by dust grains .",
    "as long as all lyman @xmath7 photons are absorbed by dust within h ii regions and re - emitted in the ir range ( @xcite ) , the area below the dash - dotted line on the @xmath111 vs.  @xmath98 plane is the forbbiden area within the framework of our theory .",
    "that is , the dash - dotted line stands for the lower boundary of _ iras _ flux corresponding to h@xmath7 ( lyman continuum photon ) flux in our model .",
    "while the correlation between @xmath97 and @xmath99 is expected theoretically from equation  ( [ eq41 ] ) , we do not find a significant correlation in observational data points in figure  5 ( the sample correlation coefficient is 0.35 ) .",
    "this point is also examined in the final part of this section .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that there is a tight observational correlation between the ir luminosity and the number of lyman continuum photons estimated from the radio luminosity ( @xcite ) . using equation  ( [ eq40 ] ) ,",
    "we compare this observational correlation with the theoretical one in figure  6 . here , we read the data directly from the figure in @xcite and re - plotted them .",
    "the sample correlation coefficient of their data is 0.96 , showing a stong correlation .",
    "the parameters of lines are the same as those in figure  5 . comparing the data and the model lines",
    ", we consider the ir luminosity of @xcite ( 40  350 @xmath82 m ) is nearly equal to the whole dust - ir luminosity in equation  ( [ eq40 ] ) because the dust luminosity of the wavelength range of @xmath112 or @xmath113 is negligible ( @xcite ) . from figure  6",
    ", we find that the theoretical lines agree with the data of @xcite excellently .",
    "this shows that our model is supported by the observation .",
    "if we assume @xmath108 for the sample of @xcite , we can determine their @xmath1 from equation  ( [ eq40 ] ) .",
    "we find @xmath114 as an average in the current sample .",
    "now , we compare it with another mean @xmath1 value estimated by the method of the previous section",
    ". since h ii regions in figure  6 have @xmath115 s@xmath59 , we shall choose 18 regions whose @xmath8 is greater than @xmath116 s@xmath59 from tables 1 and 2 .",
    "thus , we obtain a mean @xmath1 as being 0.56 by the method of section 2 .",
    "fortunately , we find a good agreement between the two @xmath1 s .    by the way",
    ", @xmath1 values estimated by the both methods are not fully consistent with each other .",
    "for example , the sample of @xcite includes the orion nebula , m8 , and m17 as the sample of table  1 does .",
    "their @xmath1 values via equation  ( [ eq40 ] ) are 0.44 , 0.59 , and 0.59 , respectively .",
    "obviously , these values are larger than those of the orion nebula , m8 , and m17 in table 1 .",
    "this may be caused by the aparture difference between two photometories , ir and radio ( see also the last paragraph in this section ) .",
    "this discrepancy may also result from our assumption in equation  ( [ eq40 ] ) that all of the energy of photons not used by hydrogen ionization is converted into ir radiation .",
    "generally , the efficiency of conversion to ir radiation is never unity because of the escape of lyman continuum photons from h ii regions or the scattering of these photons by dust . as a result , we expect rather large ir luminosities for the h ii regions by using equation  ( [ eq40 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we can not find in figure  6 the trend that the more luminous h ii regions have the smaller @xmath1 .",
    "this trend was seen in section 2.1 , where we determined @xmath1 from the metallicity .",
    "this may be the effect of ir cirrus .",
    "the observed ir flux originates from dust associated with the star forming regions and from diffuse dust heated by the interstellar radiation field . if we consider that the ir surface brightness of the cirrus component is almost constant in a galaxy , the effect of cirrus contamination in the observed ir flux of an h ii region is larger as its ir flux is lower . in the case",
    ", we may overestimate the ir luminosity for low luminosity regions , so that we may underestimate @xmath1 of such regions .",
    "figure  6 has other interesting implications : first , the dash - dotted line ( @xmath109 and @xmath117 ) means that only lyman @xmath7 photons heat dust grains and only this energy is re - emitted in ir .",
    "obviously the predicted ir luminosity in this case falls short of the observed one .",
    "next , the solid line ( @xmath109 and @xmath118 ) represents the case that only the energy of photons whose wavelength is longer than the lyman limit is absorbed by dust and re - emitted in ir . even in this case",
    ", the predicted ir luminosity is not enough to explain the observed one .",
    "hence , we conclude that a part of lyman continuum photons ought to be aborbed and reprocessed by dust .",
    "the fraction of lyman continuum photons absorbed by dust is about 0.5 or more . in terms of the fraction of the photons used by hydrogen ionization , @xmath2 in many h ii regions of our galaxy",
    "this is one of the main conclusions in the current paper .    to close this section",
    ", we must discuss a few remaining questions in the previous paragraphs : why is @xmath1 determined by our theory greater than unity for some h ii regions in table  3 ? why can not we find the observational correlation between @xmath97 and @xmath98 in figure  5 ?",
    "these may be because we use the _ iras _ psc .",
    "since the galactic h ii regions lie close to us and extend over large areas , they can never be regarded as point - like sources .",
    "hence , the ir flux for h ii regions in _ iras _ psc may be underestimated since the aperture effect of h ii regions is not neglected . therefore , _ iras _ psc may not be suitable when we measure the ir flux of galactic h ii regions ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , the correlation between the ir luminosity and the number of lyman continuum photons inferred from radio observations is tight .",
    "this observational correlation is explained very well by our theory .",
    "this is because the ir luminosities of sample in @xcite are observed in detail individually . seeing the observational tight correlation in figure  6 ,",
    "the absence of the correlation in figure  5 is caused by flux underestimation of _ iras _ psc due to the finite aperture effect .",
    "thus , if we use the _ image _ data of the h ii regions observed by _ iras _ or recent / future facilities such as _ iso _ , sofia , _ sirtf _ , or astro - f ( see @xcite for a summary of the facilities ) , the observational correlation between @xmath119 and @xmath99 will appear .",
    "in this section , we estimate @xmath1 averaged on galactic scale for the nearby spiral galaxies . then we discuss the effect of lce by dust on determining their galaxy - wide sfr . in the privious sections ,",
    "we have discussed lce by dust in h ii regions .",
    "as shown in section 2 , the parameter @xmath1 strongly depends on the dust - to - gas mass ratio . for the galactic h ii regions ,",
    "we show that @xmath120 is appropriate in equation  ( [ eq30 ] ) .",
    "that is , the orion nebula is likely to be a typical galactic h ii region in gas density and lyman continuum flux . here",
    ", we consider the orion nebula is also a typical h ii region in the other galaxies . in short ,",
    "we assume @xmath67 in equation  ( [ eq30 ] ) to be universal for the galaxies .",
    "then , we estimate a typical @xmath1 for the nearby spiral galaxies from their dust - to - gas ratio . by the way",
    ", we can determine @xmath1 of the galaxies from equation  ( [ eq41 ] ) as perfomed for the galactic h ii regions in section 3 .",
    "this alternative way is discussed in the last part of this section .    in order to determine their dust - to - gas ratio , we estimate the amount of dust mass in the nearby spiral galaxies from their ir emission re - processed by dust . as considered in the final paragraph of section 3 , we do not use _ iras",
    "_ psc since we want to estimate the entire ir luminosity of the sample galaxies safely .",
    "we adopt only the sample galaxies whose entire images by _ iras _ are available .",
    "we note another issue here .",
    "if we convert the ir emission calculated only from _ iras _ data to the dust mass , the total amount of dust will be underestimated .",
    "this is because there is large amount of cold dust ( 1020 k ) in the spiral galaxies , even in those with starburst regions ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such cold dust can not be traced by _ iras _ bands . on the other hand ,",
    "_ iso _ has better detectability for the cold dust than _ iras _ because _ iso _ covers longer wavelengths than _",
    "iras_. thus , we expect that _ iso _ data improve the estimation of dust mass .",
    "@xcite present the imaging properties of seven nearby spiral galaxies obtained by both _ iras _ and _ iso_. their sample galaxies are ngc 134 , ngc 628 ( m74 ) , ngc 660 , ngc 5194 ( m51 ) , ngc 5236 ( m83 ) , ngc 6946 , and ngc 7331 .",
    "some basic properties of these galaxies are tabulated in tables  1 , 2 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "we estimate the dust - to - gas mass ratio for alton s sample galaxies , and then , determine their @xmath1 averaged over galactic scale . to avoid the confusion from @xmath1 of the h ii regions , in this section",
    ", we express the galactic @xmath1 as being @xmath3 .",
    "of course , each sample galaxy has unique @xmath3 .",
    "we , first , calculate the dust temperature of the sample galaxies from the ratio of flux densities at 100 and 200 @xmath82 m . in this calculation",
    ", we assume the spectrum of dust emission to be the modified black - body radiation with the spectral index of 1 . here",
    ", we note that the determination of the dust temperature strongly affects the successive estimation of the dust mass .",
    "the obtained dust temperatures are shown in column ( 5 ) of table 4 .",
    "next , we estimate the dust mass , @xmath121 , in the sample galaxies from the observed flux density at 100 @xmath82 m via the following equation : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are the grain radius , grain density , and galaxy distance , respectively .",
    "@xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 are the observed flux density , grain emissivity , and the plank function of the temperature @xmath129 at the frequency @xmath130 , respectively . according to @xcite , we set @xmath131 g @xmath132 at the frequency of 100 @xmath82 m ( @xmath133 @xmath82 m and @xmath134 g @xmath135 ) .",
    "the estimated dust masses are tabulated in column ( 6 ) of table  4 .",
    "then , we determine the dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath25 , of the sample galaxies by using their total ( h",
    "i + h@xmath136 ) gas masses reported in literatures ( column 7 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath25 are in column ( 8) , and the average is about @xmath137 .",
    "this is quite consistent with @xmath25 estimated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also claim that the median value of the dust - to - gas mass ratios of sample galaxies of isophot 170 @xmath82 m serendipity survey ( @xcite ) is about @xmath138 .",
    "thus , our estimation of @xmath25 is reasonable .    it still remains open whether @xmath25 in h ii regions can be approximated to an averaged @xmath25 of the ism in the galaxies . as seen in subsection 2.2",
    ", there is a large variation of @xmath25 ( i.e. observed metallicity ) of the galactic h ii regions .",
    "moreover , most of the sample h ii regions in tables  1 and 2 have smaller @xmath25 than the typical value for the galactic ism ( @xmath29 ; spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "it may suggest that @xmath25 in h ii regions is systematically smaller than that of the ism .",
    "however , it is reported that the mean @xmath25 in the ism is not so different from that in h ii gas . @xcite",
    "have determined the dust - to - gas mass ratio of the h i , h@xmath136 , and low - density ( @xmath139 ) h ii gases in the galaxy from the data of @xmath140 . according to them , the mean value of @xmath25 in the galactic ism ( h i + h@xmath136 + h ii ) is 4.66.6@xmath141 , and that in h ii gas is 5.110@xmath141 . with the uncertainty of a factor of 2 , therefore , we assume that @xmath25 in h ii regions is approximated to the mean @xmath25 of the ism in the galaxies .    here ,",
    "let us calculate a characteristic value of the @xmath3-parameters for the sample seven spiral galaxies , adopting their dust - to - gas mass ratio ( column 8 in table 4 ) , equations  ( [ eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq30 ] ) with @xmath67 .",
    "the derived values of @xmath3 are tabulated in column ( 9 ) of table 4 .",
    "the averaged @xmath3 is 0.3 .",
    "this is nearly equal to the mean @xmath1 of the sample h ii regions in table  1 which are more luminous than the orion nebula .",
    "this small @xmath3 means that the correction factor of the sfr ( @xmath4 ; see also section [ sec : f_value ] ) for these spiral galaxies is large ( typically @xmath5 ) .",
    "although @xmath1 values of h ii regions distribute over a wide range ( 0.021 ) as shown in tables  1 and 2 , @xmath3 is approximately equal to the averaged value of the luminous h ii regions ( i.e. , the sample in table 1 ) .",
    "this may be caused by the effect of luminosity function of h ii regions .",
    "indeed , it is implied that the total luminosity of h ii regions is dominated by the regions more luminous than the orion nebula ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , @xmath3 may be shifted toward smaller values because we expect smaller @xmath1 in more luminous h ii regions ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "therefore , we think it reasonable that a characteristic @xmath3 for nearby spiral galaxies is about 0.3 .",
    "now we discuss the importance of the increment of a factor of @xmath142 for the estimated sfr .",
    "there are two other major uncertainties for the estimation of the sfr .",
    "one is related to the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the choices of a specific imf and its upper / lower limit masses affect the coefficient of the conversion formula of the sfr .",
    "the uncertainties are within a factor of about two ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the other uncertainty is related to stellar properties .",
    "the choices of the stellar properties adopted affect the conversion formula of the sfr .",
    "@xcite derived the formula , @xmath143 , adopting their stellar population synthesis model and salpeter imf ( 0.1100@xmath79 ) .",
    "we also derive the same type formula by using the same imf but by using very simplified stellar properties ( @xcite ) . in comparison with them , we find that the uncertainty due to the adopted stellar properties is at most a factor of two . therefore , we conclude that the effect of lce by dust may be more significant than the uncertainties due to the specific imf or the stellar properties for nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "finally , we discuss the alternative way for determining galaxy - wide @xmath3 . we can use equation ( [ eq41 ] ) to do it . however , there are three difficulties to determine @xmath3 reasonably .",
    "( i ) one is the uncertainty of the cirrus fraction of the ir luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "it is widely believed that the ir luminosity of the galaxies consists of two components : the warm component originating from the dust nearby the star forming regions and the cirrus component originating from the diffuse cold dust heated by the interstellar radiation field from the older stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a very difficult task to subtract the cirrus component from the observed ir luminosity of the galaxies in order to obtain the `` pure '' ir luminosity originating from the star forming regions .",
    "since the cirrus fraction differs from galaxy to galaxy ( e.g. , 0.30.8 ; @xcite ) , the subtraction of cirrus causes a significant uncertainty in the estimation of @xmath3 .",
    "the other difficulties are the correction of the h@xmath7 luminosity for ( ii ) the interstellar extinction and ( iii ) the [ n ii ] contamination .",
    "indeed , @xcite noted that the interstellar extinction at the wavelength of h@xmath7 is 1.1 mag on average for his sample galaxies .",
    "that is , the increment correction factor for h@xmath7 luminosity is 2.8 .",
    "for that case , we do not neglect such large extinction in order to determine @xmath3 reasonably .",
    "at that time , we may also have to correct the inclination of the galaxies along the line of sight to find the correct @xmath3 .",
    "the [ n ii ] contamination is more complicated if we do not have sufficient resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "fortunately , the h@xmath7 flux of @xcite is not contaminated by [ n ii ] because of their high dispersion of spectrograph .",
    "then , our main conclusions on @xmath1 of the galactic h ii regions are not altered . however , we are sure of that the [ n ii ] line contaminates the galactic h@xmath7 emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when we use equation ( [ eq41 ] ) to find @xmath3 , therefore , we always need the h@xmath7 luminosity corrected for the interstellar reddening and [ n ii ] contamination to find the true @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , we face the deficiency of the data to correct the h@xmath7 luminosity of each individual galaxy . because of several large uncertainties , thus",
    ", we can not safely determine @xmath3 of the galaxies via equation  ( [ eq41 ] ) in this paper .",
    "this problem is examined by us in the near future .",
    "for each individual h ii region in the galaxy , we examine lce by dust within such regions .",
    "then , we discuss the lce effect on determining the sfr of galaxies .",
    "we reach the following conclusions .    [ 1 ] we estimate the fraction of lyman continuum photons contributing to hydrogen ionization within the galactic h ii regions , @xmath1 .",
    "the estimated @xmath1 values distribute over a wide range ( 0.021 ) . in our framework , an h ii region with higher metallicity and",
    "larger lyman photon flux tends to have a smaller @xmath1 .    [ 2 ] from the correlation tests in figure 3 , we find that @xmath1 is approximately treated as a function of only the dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath25 . for our sample of the galactic h ii regions , the orion nebula is regarded as a typical region in gas density and lyman continuum flux .    [ 3 ] we explain theoretically the observed correlation between ir luminosity and radio luminosity of the galactic h ii regions .",
    "then , we manifest that a part of lyman continuum photons ( about a half or more ) ought to be absorbed by dust directly in many regions .    [ 4 ] we do not find the observational correlation between fluxes of _ iras _ psc and h@xmath7 for our sample h ii regions , which is expected by our model theoretically",
    ". this may indicate that _ iras _ psc is not suitable to determine the ir flux of nearby extended sources like galactic h ii regions as pointed out in literatures .    [ 5 ] if we assume that @xmath25 in h ii regions is not significantly different from a mean @xmath25 of the ism , we estimate @xmath1 averaged over galactic scale to be about 0.3 for the nearby spiral galaxies ( i.e. @xmath144 ) . consequently , the increment factor for the sfr due to the lce by dust ( @xmath4 ) is about 3 .",
    "the correction factor is larger than the uncertainties of determining the sfr due to the choice of a specific imf or stellar properties ( within a factor of 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we can not neglect the effect of lce by dust when we estimate the sfr in galaxies .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for very helpful comments , which improved quality of the paper significantly .",
    "we are also grateful to tsutomu t. takeuchi for careful reading of this paper and giving us very useful comments .",
