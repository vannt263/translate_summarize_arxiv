    "ngc  6791 is one of the most intriguing open cluster ( oc ) in the galaxy .",
    "it possesses a unique set of properties that have attracted a lot of attention in the last decade .",
    "indeed , ngc  6791 is one of the most massive ( @xmath6 ; platais et al 2011 ) , oldest ( @xmath7 gyr ; king et al .",
    "2005 ; grundahl et al . 2008 ; garcia - berro et al . 2010 ; brogaard et al . 2012 ) and most metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath8 + 0.40 ; carraro et al .",
    "2006 , gratton et al .",
    "2006 , origlia et al .",
    "2006 ) galactic ocs .",
    "more specifically , this combination of properties is unique for clusters at its galactocentric distance ( @xmath9 ; carraro 2014 ) .",
    "stars with similar age and metallicity are found in the galactic bulge ( bensby et al .",
    "2013 ) where it has been suggested ( jlkov et al .",
    "2012 ) ngc  6791 might have formed .",
    "given its peculiarities , and in particular its mass , ngc  6791 represents an ideal link between ocs and globular clusters .",
    "for this reason it has been widely targeted to understand whether star - to - star variations of light element ( c , n , o , na , o , mg and al ) abundances can be found also in this system as observed in basically all globular clusters ( gratton et al .",
    "this topic is still matter of debate and no consensus has been reached so far on whether the cluster hosts more than one generation of stars .",
    "geisler et al . (",
    "2012 ) presented evidence of na - o anti - correlation among giant stars in ngc  6791 , while recently bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and cunha et al .",
    "( 2015 ) have questioned this result finding an homogeneous na abundance ( within @xmath10 dex ) .",
    "ngc  6791 shows also an anomalous horizontal branch ( hb ) with a well populated red clump , as expected for its high metallicity , and a group of hot hb stars ( liebert et al .",
    "1994 , tofflemire et al .",
    "2014 ) , whose origin is still not completely understood ( carraro 2014 ) .",
    "the combined uv flux of the few hot hb stars and its metallicity makes this cluster a fairly good proxy of standard uv - upturn elliptical galaxies ( buzzoni et al .",
    "this result is supported also by the lick indices analysis of its spectral energy distribution .",
    "this plethora of unique properties makes ngc 6791 an extremely interesting object to study and understand .",
    "a number of questions about the nature of this system still arise : how and where could such a stellar system have formed ?",
    "is ngc 6791 a genuine oc ?",
    "did it form close to the bulge ?",
    "how could have survived for so long in the adverse high - density environment of the inner galactic disk , where it presently is ?",
    "one of the still missing key ingredient that could help to understand the origin of such a fascinating system is its original mass .    the mass budget of any stellar system is strongly affected by two - body relaxation , stellar evolution , encounters with giant molecular clouds and spiral arms , interactions with the tidal field .",
    "the disruption scenarios and the survival rates of galactic ocs have been studied since the sixties ( spitzer & harm 1958 ; spitzer 1958 ) .",
    "recently , @xmath3-body simulations ( e.g. , gieles et al . 2006 ; gieles & baumgardt 2008 ) have also shown the impact of giant molecular clouds and of the initial structure of ocs on their dissolution .",
    "the oc orbits have generally small eccentricities and they tend to be located at a small height ( @xmath11 ) on the galactic plane , as a consequence they are expected to pass many times trough the galactic disk .",
    "each of these gravitational shocks heat up and compress the cluster which then takes an elongate shape which flattens to its maximum at @xmath12 ( leon 1998 ) . repeated disk - shocking speed - up the disruption of ocs ( combes et al . 1999 ) and after each passage cluster stars rejected in the halo of the system are stripped out by the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "these ejected stars are expected to form tidal tails extending far from the cluster inner regions . indeed , davenport & sandquist ( 2010 ) and bergond et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have found that some ocs show a quite elongated and extended structures likely resulting from the interactions with the galactic tidal field .    in general",
    ", ocs are thought to dissipate in a timescale of the order of @xmath13 yr ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . in this context",
    "the existence of very old ocs like ngc  6791 represents an anomaly gyr ) ocs for which such an argument applies are ngc  188 , m  67 and berkley  11 . ] .",
    "this system may have managed to survive so long either because it moved along a preferential orbit or its original mass was much larger than observed today .",
    "in this paper we analyse the two - dimensional ( 2d ) and projected density distributions of ngc  6791 with the aim of understanding whether the cluster suffered from strong tidal interactions that could have significantly decreased its mass .",
    "we find that this system has an elongated structure and shows overdensities in the external regions that are aligned to the direction of the orbital motion .",
    "these features strongly suggest that this system has likely lost part of its mass because of gravitational shocks and interaction with the galactic tidal field .",
    "we use this argument to support the hypothesis that this system was significantly more massive than observed today and we derive an estimate for its original mass by means of a simplified analytic approach .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  2 data - set and data - reduction procedures are described , in section  3 the 2d density map is obtained while in section  4 both the star - count projected density and the surface brightness profiles are analysed ; finally in section  5 we estimate , the initial mass of ngc  6791 .",

    "this camera consists of a mosaic of 36 chips of @xmath17 pixels each , with a pixel scale of @xmath18 pixel@xmath19 providing a total field of view of @xmath20 .",
    "we used four different pointings set up to cover a total field of view of @xmath21 centered approximately on the cluster center ( figure  1 ) . for each pointing four images",
    "acquired both with the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands and with exposure times @xmath24 sec and @xmath25 sec respectively have been secured .",
    "an appropriate dither pattern of few arcesc have been adopted for each pointing .",
    "this allowed us to cover most of the inter - chip gaps , with the exception of the most prominent and horizontal ones ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the data were pre - processed ( i.e. bias and flat - field corrected ) by the elixir pipeline developed by the cfht team . by means of an iterative procedure , an adequate number ( @xmath26 ) of isolated and bright stars",
    "have been selected in each chip and band to model the point spread function ( psf ) . then the psf model was applied to all the stellar - like sources at about @xmath27 from the local background by using daophot and the psf - fitting algorithm allstar ( stetson 1987 ) . for each filter and chip",
    "we matched the single - frame catalogues to obtain a master list .",
    "finally , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 master lists were then geometrically matched and combined .",
    "each master list includes the instrumental magnitude , defined as the weighted mean of the single image measurement reported to the system reference frame of the transformation , and the error , which is the standard error of the mean .",
    "the instrumental coordinates have been reported independently for each chip to the absolute astrometric system ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) using a large number of stars in common with the dr7 release of the sloan digital sky survey ( abazajian et al .",
    "2007 ) and following the procedure described by dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . using the same stars",
    ", we derived for each chip and band the zero - points to report the instrumental magnitudes to the sloan photometric system . at this stage",
    "all the master lists are in the same photometric and astrometric system .",
    "we then merged them to create the final catalogue , which counts about 270,000 stars .",
    "the ( @xmath22 , @xmath30 ) colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of ngc  6791 and of the surrounding field are shown in figure  2 . in the cmds , it is possible to clearly distinguish the main sequence ( ms ) of the cluster ( left panel of figure  2 ) , extending down to @xmath31 in the innermost regions , corresponding to about five magnitudes below the turn - off . also , it is possible to note that our data suffer of strong saturation starting at @xmath32 .",
    "two almost vertical sequences located around @xmath33 and @xmath34 are clearly visible both in the innermost ( figure  2 left panel ) and external regions ( figure  2 right panel ) . they are populated by m - dwarf and main - sequence galactic disk stars .    a differential reddening of about @xmath35 has been estimated for this cluster ( see for example platais et al .",
    "indeed , at the level of the turn - off ( @xmath36 ) , the ms shows a mild broadening not explainable in terms of pure photometric errors .",
    "such an effect disappears at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath37 ) , where the ms starts to bend diagonally in the ( @xmath22 , @xmath30 ) cmd . given its relatively small amplitude",

    ", @xmath30 ) cmds of the innermost region of ngc  6791 ( _ left panel _ ) and of the `` control field '' ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the black box along the ms of ngc  6791 encloses the region in the cmd where cp stars have been selected .",
    "the shaded area defines the region where fiducial galactic disk ms stars have been selected.,width=321 ]    to probe the spatial distribution of ngc  6791 we first analysed the 2d density distribution .",
    "the density analysis of ngc  6791 has been performed in the circular area enclosed within a distance from the cluster center ( see details in section  4 ) @xmath38 , thus covering a @xmath39 area .",
    "we selected stars along the ms in the magnitude range @xmath40 and within three times the local color dispersion about the cluster mean ridge line ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "stars selected in this way define the  cluster population \" ( cp ) sample .",
    "these selection criteria have been chosen to ensure a good level of completeness and to minimize the contamination from galactic field stars .",
    "variations of the adopted magnitude limits do no affect the final result .",
    "as a first qualitative step , we obtained a rough smoothed density distribution of cp stars . as expected , at a first look , the distribution of cp stars appears to be extremely concentrated around the position of the cluster and it shows some irregularities and structures allover the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "we also note that the north - west quadrant shows on average a smoother distribution than the other quadrants for @xmath41 .",
    "to investigate in more detail the two - dimensional distribution of cp stars , we adopted the widely used optimal matched filter technique ( see for example kuhn et al .",
    "1996 ; rockosi et al .",
    "2002 ; odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "it has been shown ( davenport & sandquist 2010 ) that this method is robust for identifying low - density stellar populations against a significant background , as in the case of ocs .",
    "the optimal matched filter technique requires to use a fiducial field population as reference . for this purpose , we selected stars in the same magnitude and colour bins as the cp sample and located at @xmath42 from the cluster center in the north - west quadrant ( because of its apparent homogeneous distribution ) .",
    "we named this sample of stars  control field \" ( cf ; figures  1 and 2 ) .",
    "we computed the densities in the cmds ( hess diagrams ) of both the cp and cf samples .",
    "then we assigned to each star in the cp sample a weight defined as the reciprocal of the fraction of cf stars lying within a fixed range of colour and magnitude from its location in the cmd .",
    "finally , the weighted distribution of star positions was transformed into a smoothed surface density function through the use of a kernel whose width has been chosen to be large enough so as to make negligible the impact of the gaps in the fov .",
    "this procedure yields the surface density distribution shown in figure  3 . as apparent ,",
    "the overall density distribution is elongated and irregular .",
    "in particular , we observe that the innermost @xmath43 are quite spherical , while at larger distance the cluster starts to be distorted mainly along the north - east / south - west direction in an almost symmetrical way respect to the center of the cluster . at @xmath41 ,",
    "two tails running at opposite directions are clearly visible , with the one in the southern direction extending up to distances larger than @xmath44 from the cluster center .",
    "it is important to note that both the external tidal arms and the innermost elongation of the cluster run almost parallel to the absolute proper motion vector ( bedin et al .",
    "2006 ) and to the direction of the galactic center ( galc ; figure  3 ) .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with a real tidal nature for the observed distortions .",
    "in fact , the orbital motion of ngc  6791 likely develops close to the galactic equatorial plane ( jlkov et al .",
    "2012 ) and , since tidal tails are supposed to lie on the orbital plane ( at least in axisymmetric potentials , see montuori et al .",
    "2007 ) , they are expected to be seen with such a projected alignment .",
    "moreover , other distortions extending almost perpendicularly to the pm direction are clearly visible and their formation could be related to the tidal effect due to the galactic disk ( e.g. , bergond et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the features observed in the 2d density distribution of ngc  6791 are indeed typical evidence of recent stellar mass loss due to dynamical evolution of the system under the tidal influence of the overall galactic potential .",
    "it is interesting to note that the density map of ngc  6791 is qualitatively similar to that observed in m  67 by davenport & sandquist ( 2010 ) and to a weaker extent to other three ocs ( namely ngc  2287 , ngc  2516 and ngc  2548 ) by bergond et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "we also note that in the south - east quadrant for @xmath45 there is a star density increase that does not seem to be directly connected to the cluster .",
    "interestingly enough , this overdensity appears at decreasing galactic latitude therefore we speculate that it might be due to the density gradient of galactic disk stars .      to further check the significance of the anisotropic distribution of ngc  6791 we used for comparison stars selected in the cmd in the range @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "these are likely ms galactic disk stars and they trace the behaviour of the main contributors to the contamination of cp stars . this sample is supposed to be homogeneously distributed across the fov and actual deviations from a smooth distribution reflect variations in the detection efficiency , galactic field and/or extinction gradients .",
    "we performed on this sub - sample the same analysis done previously for cp stars .",
    "the 2d density map of ms galactic disk stars is shown in figure  4 .",
    "we observe that in general they are uniformly distributed across the fov as expected , but they show a density excess in the external regions of the south - east quadrant .",
    "this evidence further suggests that the relevant feature in the 2d density distribution of cp stars at @xmath45 ( figure  3 ) in this quadrant , is likely due to a gradient of the density of the galactic disk within the fov .",
    "in addition , we divided the fov in ten angular sectors of @xmath48 each with vertex at the cluster center .",
    "then for each sector with angle @xmath49 measured counter - clockwise from the west direction , and for different distances from the cluster center we estimated the ratio between cp stars ( @xmath50 ) , and likely galactic disk ms stars , selected as described before ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the results for @xmath52 and @xmath53 are shown in figure  5 . in both cases",
    "the ratio shows significant variations as a function of @xmath49 , as expected for a real anisotropic density distribution .",
    "moreover it is also worth noting that different patterns in the central and outermost regions appear .",
    "for @xmath53 the maxima of the ratio occur at @xmath54 and @xmath55 corresponding to the two opposite main tidal arms .     and @xmath47 , which are representative of the galactic field contamination ( see section  3.2 ) .",
    "colors are in the same relative scale as in figure  3.,width=321 ]    these sanity checks demonstrate that the observed 2d density distribution shown in figure  3 is a real feature of ngc  6791 and can not be ascribed to observational bias or field gradients .",
    "star density distortions , elongation and tidal tails are expected to be detected also in the radial density profile ( see for example odenkirchen et al .",
    "2003 ; capuzzo - dolcetta et al .",
    "therefore as a second step of our analysis , we studied the projected density profile of ngc  6791 .",
    "first we derived the center of gravity ( c@xmath56 ) by using an iterative procedure ( see for example dalessandro et al .",
    "2013 ) and averaging the positions @xmath28 and @xmath29 of cp stars .",
    "we used the center reported by the webda web page as starting guess point of our procedure . to avoid spurious effects due to incompleteness we performed several estimates by adopting different magnitude and distance selections .",
    "in particular , we used three different magnitude bins in the range @xmath40 , with the upper limit ( fainter magnitude ) increasing by 0.5 mag at each step . for each magnitude bin",
    ", we repeated the procedure for four different radial selections , from @xmath57 to @xmath58 with a step of @xmath59 .",
    "we ended up with a total of 20 estimates .",
    "the resulting c@xmath56 is the average of these measures and it is located at @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( r.a.= 290.2261395 dec=37.77366712 ) , with an uncertainty of @xmath62 .",
    "this new determination is located at @xmath63 north - east from the center reported by the webda web page .",
    "while it is not trivial to understand the origin of this discrepancy , we stress here that it has a negligible impact on the results presented in this paper .",
    "( section  3 ) for stars at @xmath52 ( _ upper panel _ ) and at @xmath53 ( _ lower panel_).,width=321 ]    the projected density profile of ngc  6791 has been determined using direct counts of cp stars .",
    "we excluded the south - east quadrant from the analysis since in the most external part of this region the star distribution is dominated by ms galactic disk stars ( section  3.1 ) . using the procedure described in dalessandro et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we divided the considered fov into 18 concentric annuli , each centered on c@xmath56 and suitably split in an adequate number of subsectors .",
    "number counts have been calculated in each subsector and the corresponding densities were obtained dividing them by the sampled area . incomplete area coverage , mainly due to the presence of gaps ( figure  1 ) , have been properly taken into account .",
    "the stellar density of each annulus was then defined as the average of the subsector densities and its standard deviation computed from the variance among the subsectors .",
    "the resulting projected surface density profile is shown in figure  6 .",
    "we estimated the background density contribution by using only stars in the north - west quadrant .",
    "in fact , as discussed before ( see also figure  3 ) this region is free by any evident structure caused either by the cluster elongation or from field stars .",
    "the background contribution has been estimated as the average of the four outermost density measurements ( @xmath64 ) , which define a kind of plateau at @xmath65 stars arcsec@xmath66 .",
    "we then subtracted this value to the observed density profile .",
    "we have verified that this choice is appropriate .",
    "in fact , the contribution to the background due to field stars ( see selection criteria in section 3.1 ) is constant in all quadrants but the south - east one .",
    "the derived density profile has been reproduced by using a single - mass king model ( king 1966 ) .",
    "the fitting procedure is fully described in miocchi et al .",
    "the fit was limited to the innermost @xmath52 to avoid the most elongated regions of the cluster .",
    "the best - fit is obtained for a concentration @xmath67 ( corresponding to a central dimensionless potential @xmath68 ) and core radius @xmath69 .",
    "these parameters are in partial disagreement with those obtained by platais et al .",
    "( 2011 ; @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) which to our knowledge is the only other density profile analysis present in the literature for ngc  6791 .",
    "the authors obtained the density profile using stars with @xmath72 and weighted according to their proper motion .",
    "however their data were limited to the innermost @xmath73 and therefore the determination of the tidal radius and any residual in the background contribution was rather unstable .    as apparent in figure  6 , for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) the density profile clearly deviates from the behaviour predicted by the king model .",
    "the use of a wilson model ( wilson 1975 ) does not provide any significant improvement on the overall quality of the fit .",
    "we have also checked that even if we do not constrain the model to fit the innermost region , there is no way to satisfactory reproduce the density profile for @xmath75 .",
    "the external part of the projected density profile instead follows a power - law behaviour with an exponent @xmath76 , in agreement with the values found in galactic globular clusters with observed tidal tails ( see for example sollima et al . 2011 and references therein ) and as predicted by theoretical models ( johnston et al .",
    "kpper et al .",
    "( 2010 ) analysed the variation of the power - law slopes of tidal tails of dissolving clusters as a function of the orbital phase , eccentricity and initial cluster densities by means of n - body simulations .",
    "they found that the power - law slopes have typical values @xmath77 that can increase reaching values @xmath78 for systems with highly eccentric orbits and close to or at the apogalacticon , where tidal tails get strongly compressed .",
    "this upper limit is in good agreement with what found for ngc  6791 , however we should note that the analysis by kpper et al . (",
    "2010 ) is performed on clusters moving on orbits perpendicular to the line of sight , while this is not the case for ngc  6791 . as a consequence",
    "the relatively shallow power - law observed in ngc  6791 can be the result also of projection effects .",
    "to further investigate the results just described and check whether they might be caused by incompleteness or bias of our photometric catalogue , we also derived the surface brightness profile by performing the analysis directly on fits images ( see for example dalessandro et al .",
    "we used a low - resolution single - plate eso digitalized sky survey image obtained in optical band and extending up to about @xmath79 from c@xmath56 .",
    "we limited the analysis to the same quadrants used for deriving the star counts density profile and we used the north - west quadrant to estimate the background contribution .",
    "we divided the fov in a similar number of concentric annuli and subsectors . the surface brightness assigned to each annulus",
    "is given by the ratio between the mean of the fluxes measured in the subsectors and the area covered by the annulus .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profile is shown in figure  7 .",
    "first we observe that the king model best - fitting the star counts density profile well reproduces also the surface brightness profile .",
    "more importantly , we note that consistently with what found in the star count projected density profile , for @xmath75 the surface brightness profile starts to deviate from the behaviour predicted by the model and it declines as a power - law .",
    "we can therefore safely conclude that both the 2d density map and the density ( surface brightness ) profile analysis suggest that ngc  6791 is currently experiencing tidal stripping events .",
    "it is worth noting that king et al .",
    "( 2005 ) observed a rather flat mass function in the centre of ngc  6791 by using very deep _ hubble space telescope _",
    "this observational evidence further supports the results obtained in this work .",
    "in fact , for clusters that experienced episodes of mass loss , a flat mass function is expected because of the preferential depletion of low mass stars .",
    "a detailed analysis of the radial variation of the mass function of this system will be presented in an upcoming paper ( e. dalessandro et al .",
    "the observational evidence presented in the previous sections reveal that ngc  6791 might have lost a fraction of its original mass due to environmental effects ( like tidal shocks due to close interactions with giant molecular clouds , spiral arms , the galactic disk and , in general , to the interactions with the galactic tidal field ) or internal dynamical effects ( like two - body relaxation . in this section",
    "we attempt to estimate the total mass lost by ngc  6791 during its evolution and derive its original mass .    while many recipes can be used for this purpose ( e.g. , vesperini et al .",
    "2013 ) , we adopted the approach described by lamers et al .",
    "it has the advantage of describing the way the mass of a cluster decreases with time by means of relatively simple analytic expressions .",
    "the analysis by lamers et al .",
    "( 2005 ) accounts for the effect of both stellar and dynamical evolution .",
    "it is important to note that the results obtained with this simplified approach are in good agreement with those obtained by detailed @xmath3-body simulations for clusters in the tidal field of the galaxy ( see also lamers & gieles 2006 ) .",
    "lamers et al .",
    "( 2005 ) provide an expression for the initial mass of the cluster , @xmath80 , in terms of its age ( @xmath81 ) and present mass ( @xmath82 ) :    @xmath83^{1/\\gamma } \\left[1-q_{\\mathrm{ev}}(t ) \\right]^{-1}\\ ] ]    @xmath84 is the dissolution time scale parameter .",
    "it is a constant depending on the strength of the tidal field and it basically describes the mass loss due to dissolution processes such as galactic tidal field interactions and shocks due to encounters with giant molecular clouds or spiral arms ( gieles et al . 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "the smaller values of @xmath84 are typically associated to encounters with molecular clouds and spiral arms , while the larger to the galactic tidal field . also , the longer @xmath84 , the weaker the tidal effect is .",
    "we used @xmath85myr ( corresponding to the disruption time of @xmath86gyr for a cluster with the initial mass of @xmath87m@xmath88 ) , obtained by lamers et al .",
    "( 2005 ) by comparing the distribution of mass and age of ocs in the solar neighbourhood with theoretical predictions .",
    "this choice is reasonable since the current galactocentric distance of ngc  6791 roughly corresponds to that of the sun .",
    "@xmath89 is a dimensionless index , which depends on the cluster initial density distribution and has typical values ranging from about 0.6 to 0.8 , which increases with the concentration , as constrained from theoretical studies ( gieles et al .",
    "2004 ) and observations ( boutloukos et al . 2003 ) .",
    "@xmath89 is usually constrained by the king dimensionless potential @xmath90 , which characterises the concentration of the king models ( king 1966 ) .",
    "we adopted here @xmath91 corresponding to @xmath92 that is a typical value for open clusters and is in agreement with what derived by the analysis of the observed star count density and surface brightness profiles ( @xmath93 ; section  4 ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that the star cluster density distributions change with time , therefore including the present - day value of @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m_ini_approx ] ) represents a crude approximation . in particular , it is well known ( e.g. trenti et al . 2010 ) that the concentration of stellar systems tend to increase ( and @xmath90 accordingly increases ) as the dynamical evolution of star cluster proceeds . as a consequence ,",
    "given the proportionality linking @xmath89 to @xmath90 , if the adopted value of @xmath90 is larger that its initial one , also the adopted value of @xmath89 will represent an upper limit to the correct one .",
    "the function @xmath94 describes the mass loss due to stellar evolution and can be approximated by the following analytical formula :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are coefficients that depend on the cluster metallicity .",
    "the [ fe@xmath99h ] abundance of ngc6791 is about @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ; carraro et al .",

    "this data - set allowed us to derive updated estimates of its structural parameters , by fitting a king profile over both the star counts and surface brightness profiles .",

    "some of them seem to closely follow the cluster motion , while others are nearly perpendicular to the galactic disk .",
    "these are clearly visible both in the 2d surface density map and in the projected density profile and they represent typical evidence of recent stellar mass loss .",
    "we can therefore argue that ngc  6791 might have lost quite a significant fraction of its original mass while orbiting around the galactic center . by using a simple analytic approach ( lamers et al .",
    "2005 ) , we estimated the mass likely lost by ngc  6791 during its evolution because of the effect of both stellar evolution and dynamical interactions . from this calculation we estimated the mass at its birth to be @xmath4@xmath108 , several tens larger than its present - day mass .",
    "this derivation lends support to a scenario in which ngc 6791 was a much more massive system .",
    "this would qualitatively explain why the cluster could have survived for such a long time ( its age is around 7 - 8 gyr ) contrary to the expectations of current estimates for the destruction rates of ocs in the galaxy .    it is interesting to note also that @xmath80 is comparable to the present - day mass of most galactic globular clusters and it is in rough agreement with the initial mass of the least massive clusters hosting multiple stellar populations ( see for example dalessandro et al .",
