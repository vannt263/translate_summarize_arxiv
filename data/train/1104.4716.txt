    "our primary motivation comes from the actual physical concepts  @xcite ; however , our realization differs from the original attempts in various significant details .",
    "the second aspect of our method is that it enables a transformation into a format which is useful for an analysis of a partial trend or relative fluctuations on the time scale window of interest .    as with most science problems ,",
    "the representation of data is the key to efficient and effective solutions .",
    "the underlying link between our approach and the string theory may be seen in the switching from a local to a non - local form of the data description .",

    "the string theory development over the past 25 years achieved a high degree of popularity among physicists  @xcite .",
    "the reason lies in its inherent ability to unify theories that come from diverse physical spheres .",
    "the prime instrument of the unification represents the concept of extra dimension .",
    "the side - product of theoretical efforts can be seen in the elimination of the ultraviolet divergences of feynman diagrams . however , despite the considerable achievements , there is a lack of the experimental verification of the original string theory .",

    "the term _ duality _ is used to refer to the relationship between two systems that have different descriptions but identical physics ( identical trading operations ) .",
    "let us analyze the 1-end - point elementary string map when the currency changes from direct to indirect .",
    "the change can be formalized by means of the transformation @xmath60 for the 1-end - point map model of the string , eq.([eq : stringq ] ) , we obtained @xmath61 let us consider two - member space of maps @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",

    ", the compactification may be viewed as an act of the information reduction of the original signal data , which makes the transformed signal periodic .",
    "of course , it is not very favorable to close strings by the complete periodization of real input signals .",
    "partial closure would be more interesting .",
    "this uses pre - mapping @xmath95 where the input of any open string ( see e.g. eq.([eq : string1 ] ) , eq.([eq : pq2p ] ) ) is made up partially compact .",
