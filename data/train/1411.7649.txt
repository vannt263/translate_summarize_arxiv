    "the physics of cosmic rays is only partially understood . indeed some basic questions like where they come from , how they are accelerated , how they propagate in the galaxy and beyond , and even what particle type they are , have only tentative answers . despite the considerable experimental progress accomplished over the last century ,",
    "most of the key points are still open .",
    "the flux is well measured but it is just one tool to investigate the nature of cosmic rays .",
    "some important clues have to come from the measurements of the primary mass composition and the arrival direction distribution .",
    "in particular composition data are crucial to find the transition between the galactic and extragalactic components of cosmic rays ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) and to elucidate the origin of the flux suppression at the highest energies @xcite .",
    "the measured all particle energy spectrum extends from below @xmath2{ev}$ ] to above @xmath3{ev}$ ] , more than eleven orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "it can be roughly approximated by a broken power law with four spectral features including the knee at a few times @xmath4{ev}$ ] , the ankle at @xmath5{ev}$ ] , and the cutoff at @xmath6{ev}$ ] .",
    "in addition a second knee was recently reported by the kascade - grande collaboration at @xmath7{ev}$ ] @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the evolution of primary mass composition with energy , measured by several experiments , has been reviewed .",
    "although systematic uncertainties are large , data from optical detectors show composition changes in regions corresponding to the observed spectral features .",
    "composition seems to become progressively heavier from the first to the second knee .",
    "a transition from a heavy to a light composition then appears up to the ankle .",
    "data collected by the pierre auger observatory show a new change that marks the beginning of a transition from light to heavy primaries in the ankle region  @xcite .",
    "this transition is not confirmed by telescope array data , which are more compatible with a proton dominated composition @xcite .",
    "the present telescope array statistics is however insufficient to distinguish between the composition profile seen by auger and a proton dominated case  @xcite . in spite of large systematic uncertainties ,",
    "surface detector data also show a trend from light to heavy primaries above the knee .",
    "in addition data from the auger surface detector show a gradual mass number increase above @xmath8{ev}$ ]  @xcite , in agreement with its fluorescence detector observations .",
    "the cosmic ray composition can be inferred indirectly from the atmospheric depth at which the maximum development of an air shower is reached ( @xmath9 ) and from the muon content at ground level ( see for instance ref .",
    "the @xmath9 parameter is observed with fluorescence telescopes and muons are measured with dedicated detectors .",
    "it is very well known that the shower muonic component is also sensitive to high energy hadronic interactions .",
    "therefore , as shown in ref .  @xcite simultaneous measurements of @xmath9 and muons allow for their testing .",
    "different muon detector types have been used since the earliest surface arrays  @xcite and , more recently , by kascade @xcite and yakutsk @xcite .",
    "two different techniques for counting muons have been employed : there are on the one hand _ analog _ detectors , that produce a signal proportional to the number of muons and _ digital _ ones , that are divided into segments and count muons based on the number of segments with a signal .",
    "hybrid detectors combining both techniques have already been used in casa - mia  @xcite and agasa  @xcite .",
    "muon counters are currently being installed in auger as part of the amiga project ( auger muons and infill for the ground array ) , an enhancement to extend the observation energy of auger down to @xmath10{ev}$ ] and to perform composition studies  @xcite .",
    "amiga also includes a triangular array of water cherenkov detectors identical to those used in the surface array but spaced @xmath11{m}$ ] apart , half its distance .",
    "each amiga surface detector will be accompanied by 3 nearby plastic scintillator detectors buried at @xmath12{m}$ ] to count muons . in the vertical direction ,",
    "the soil overburden provides a shielding of 20 radiation lengths and entails a muon threshold of @xmath13 above ground",
    ". the amiga muon detector will accept events up to @xmath14 of zenith angle .",
    "each muon counter has a sensitive surface area of @xmath15{m^2}$ ] and is divided into 64 scintillator strips of equal size .",
    "each strip is long , wide , and thick . in the amiga case",
    "the scintillator strip is the generic segment of a segmented detector .",
    "the three counters at each array position are equivalent to a single detector divided into @xmath16 segments that covers @xmath17{m^2}$ ] . each strip",
    "is fitted lengthwise with a wavelength shifting fibre that drives light to a pixel of a 64 multianode pmt .",
    "the muon detector has a dead time of given by the width of the muon pulse .",
    "muons arriving at the same strip closer in time are not resolved . with the same aim as amiga ,",
    "3 fluorescence telescopes were deployed by the heat project  @xcite .",
    "heat and the amiga @xmath11{m}$ ] surface array are already fully operational .",
    "there are also 22 amiga muon counters taking data , 16 of @xmath18{m^2}$ ] and 6 of @xmath19{m^2}$ ] . the counters are deployed in an hexagon around a central position .",
    "most of them are installed in two positions to compare the detector response in different conditions , as the burial depth for example .",
    "the other 5 positions have a single @xmath18{m^2}$ ] counter each .",
    "furthermore , auger is also planning to upgrade its @xmath20{m}$ ] surface detector to perform detailed composition analyses at the highest energies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the near future there will be simultaneous measurements of @xmath9 and muons , the two parameters most sensitive to primary mass , starting from the second knee region up to the highest energies .",
    "these detailed measurements , in which muon detectors play a fundamental role , will allow unprecedented composition analyses that have the potential to make a decisive contribution in the understanding of the transition between the galactic and extragalactic cosmic ray components , as well as the nature of the suppression observed at the highest energies .",
    "a method for reconstructing the amiga muon lateral distribution function ( mldf ) was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work a new reconstruction that improves the amiga resolution is presented .",
    "the enhancement is made possible by using an exact likelihood function in the mldf fit . as a result",
    "the power to disentangle the primary composition increases .",
    "the new method is suitable for any array of segmented counters .    in section [ sec : methods ] the original and the new reconstructions are presented .",
    "section  [ sec : simulations ] describes air shower and detector simulations used in this work and section  [ sec : saturation ] continues with an estimation of the maximum number of muons that a segmented detector can measure before saturating .",
    "section  [ sec : comparison ] contains a comparison of iron reconstructions at @xmath21{ev}$ ] and zenith angle @xmath22 , which is extended to all simulated energies and zenith angles in section  [ sec : performance ] . in section",
    "[ sec : conf ] we review the performance of the new method for different array configurations .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the average number of muons expected in a detector ( @xmath23 ) depends on the muon density ( @xmath24 ) , the detector area ( @xmath25 ) and the zenith angle ( @xmath26 ) according to @xmath27 the actual number of muons impinging on the detector ( @xmath28 ) fluctuates event by event following a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath29    one has to make a distinction between expected and actual number of muons , as the aim of a counter is estimating a muon density rather than counting the exact number of particles that crossed the detector .",
    "the difference is subtle but important .",
    "for example when only one segment has a signal then @xmath30 with @xmath31 of confidence level . the probability of only one segment on when @xmath32 , the next best case , is only @xmath33",
    ". however in this case , the number of expected muons @xmath23 can only be estimated to fall in the rather broad interval @xmath34 $ ] with a 1@xmath35 confidence level as shown in [ sec : appendixa ] .",
    "the detector resolution is driven by the poissonian fluctuations in @xmath28 rather than by the detector segmentation in this example .",
    "in general the resolution is determined by the finite particle number when @xmath28 is much less than the number of segments .",
    "there is a key methodological difference between the original and the new reconstruction .",
    "while the first one starts from @xmath28 , the new method is built from @xmath23 .",
    "both reconstructions are presented below .",
    "a simplified detector model considering the detector size and segmentation is used to compare the reconstructions .",
    "this model is a good approximation to the amiga detector , which is designed to be close to @xmath36 efficient and to have a low noise level .",
    "the original reconstruction , introduced in  @xcite , is here briefly reviewed for the sake of completeness .",
    "an approximate likelihood function is used by this method .",
    "stations are divided into three classes : saturated , good and silent .",
    "a station is silent if it has less than 3 segments on .",
    "a segment is on when it has a signal compatible with one or more muons .",
    "the silent limit of 3 was set to reject accidental triggers caused by background muons crossing two strips .",
    "a detector is considered as saturated when 130 or more segments are on in at least one time bin .",
    "this limit has to be set because the adopted likelihood underestimates data errors . at 130 segments the statistical uncertainty is @xmath37 larger than the one used in the reconstruction .",
    "the underestimation grows with the number of segments on .",
    "finally good stations are those that are neither saturated nor silent .",
