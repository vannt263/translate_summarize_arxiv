    "the understanding of anomalies in quantum field theories has important applications both because it provides a strict criterion to select consistent gauge theories and because it represents a way to explain a number of experimental facts ( for the original works see @xcite ) .",
    "the explicit calculation of the anomalous ward identities in standard theories shows that the anomaly manifests itself as the impossibility to define two or more conserved currents in the quantum theory rather than the breaking of a single symmetry .",
    "the vector and axial symmetries can not be simultaneously implemented taking into account quantum corrections , but it is possible to define the theory in a way that , for example , the vector symmetry is preserved . from this point of view",
    "an interesting conceptual question is weather or not the space - time symmetry that we observe in nature participates in this clash of symmetries ; in other words , is the anomaly the impossibility to define a quantum relativistic theory with conserved vector and axial currents or does lorentz symmetry behave as a spectator in this clash ?",
    "the aim of the paper is to address this problem in a broad class of lorentz violating theories , focusing on those that can be treated perturbatively and do not include gravitational interactions .    on the other hand , the investigation of quantum field theories that do not possess the relativistic symmetry has attracted much interest among particle physicists during the last decades .",
    "one of the most fascinating motivations is the possibility to interpret these models as effective descriptions of more fundamental theories where gravity is consistently included and the breaking of lorentz invariance occurs spontaneously @xcite .",
    "relaxing lorentz invariance might also open further ways to address phenomenological problems @xcite and for these reasons much work has been done to investigate conceptual issues of quantum field theory with lorentz violation , for example causality , stability @xcite and renormalization @xcite . among the most popular frameworks , which extend the standard model ( sm ) by incorporating lorentz violating operators , there are the works by coleman and glashow @xcite and colladay and kostelecky @xcite , where quite general assumptions like locality , translational invariance and power - counting renormalizability are made .    in this paper , by making those assumptions , we provide a derivation of the perturbative anomalies allowing general ( but small ) lorentz violating operators . for the sake of definiteness , here we focus on the case of a single family of fermions or at least on the case in which the lorentz violating parameters are diagonal in the family space . our strategy is to deal with fermions coupled to gauge fields , which can be either dynamical or non - dynamical , therefore describing both the anomalies of gauge and global currents .",
    "the ( one - loop ) 3-point ( green ) functions involving three currents are analyzed and the anomalous parts are proved to be independent of all the lorentz violating parameters , which are compatible with the gauge symmetries at the classical level , by using a certain momentum cut - off regularization . although we have more freedom to change the form of the anomalies in this framework ( as lorentz non - invariant counterterms are allowed ) , we show that this is not sufficient to eliminate the anomaly by adding local terms to the lagrangian , which are polynomial in the gauge fields and their derivatives .",
    "therefore , the anomaly cancellation conditions turn out to be very stable .    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe in detail our class of lorentz violating fermion models coupled to general gauge fields .",
    "we then consider in section [ fermionredef ] the 3-point functions for the currents and show , in particular regularizations , that their anomalous part reproduces the analogous quantities in the lorentz invariant case . in section [ regulator - indep ] ,",
    "we provide a regulator independent argument , which shows that the anomaly cancellation conditions remain at least as strong as in the lorentz invariant limit .",
    "we end with some conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "we consider a family of fermions @xmath0 in a general representation of a ( compact lie ) group @xmath1 . in the following",
    "we will write an action that contains a certain number of lorentz violating terms .",
    "let us assume the corresponding parameters to be small ( in a sense that will be clarified later on ) and the corresponding theory to be perturbative with respect to ( w.r.t . ) them .",
    "this assumption allows us to consider @xmath0 as an object with four _ spinorial _ components , as a discrete quantity can not be changed by a small perturbation .",
    "the infinitesimal action of @xmath1 on @xmath0 is = i i ^b ( t^b_l p_l + t^b_r p_r ) , [ psitransf]where @xmath2 represent the group transformation parameters , @xmath3 is the projector on the left - handed ( right - handed ) subspaces , @xmath4 is defined as in lorentz invariant theories and @xmath5 are the hermitian generators in the left - handed ( right - handed ) representation .",
    "we imagine that each generator of @xmath1 corresponds to a gauge field @xmath6 , @xmath7 , but we do not require each gauge field to be dynamical : in this way we can study both the anomalies associate with gauge currents and those associate with global currents .",
    "the action of @xmath1 on @xmath6 and the covariant derivative of the fermion are respectively defined by a_^b = f^c d b ^d a_^c + _ ^b , [ atransf]where @xmath8 are the structure constants of @xmath1 , satisfying @xmath9=if^{bcd}t^d_l$ ] , and d_like in lorentz invariant theories , as their form is only consequence of gauge invariance and therefore is insensitive to any lorentz violation .",
    "here we only consider chiral representations : t^b_l t^b_r , .[chirality]this is indeed the only case when anomalies can appear in lorentz invariant theories .",
    "all the ingredients introduced so far are also present in standard theories .",
    "we now want to write a ( classical ) action for @xmath0 in the @xmath10 background , which involves lorentz violating terms . by following the works of coleman and glashow @xcite and colladay and kostelecky @xcite , we assume the following properties :    * locality , * translational invariance , * power - counting renormalizability ( operators with dimension greater than four are not allowed ) .",

    "these energies ( or equivalently boosts ) are at a very high scale @xmath24 where the spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance occurs . for example",
    "it is conceivable , but not obligatory , that @xmath24 is the planck scale .",
    "therefore , the model at hand should be considered as a low energy effective description . from an effective field theory point of view",
    "we expect @xcite @xmath25 to be at most of order @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be at most of order @xmath28 and therefore these parameters are tiny if @xmath20 is identified with the mass of the observed fermions .    in the following",
    "we will not assume @xmath29 to be invariant under ( [ psitransf ] ) ; in this way our analysis will be applicable also to those theories , like the minimal sm , where the fermion masses emerge from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a gauge symmetry .",
    "however , we do assume the first term in ( [ action ] ) to be invariant under ( [ psitransf ] ) as , at least in the power - counting renormalizable case , the higgs mechanism can not modify that term . since the generators satisfy ( [ chirality ] ) ,",

    "this four - vector has been introduced by performing the following replacements in the assignment of figure [ graphs ] : @xmath63 and @xmath127 , respectively in the graph on the left and on the right in figure [ graphs ] . like in subsection",
    "[ massless ] , the linear superficial divergence of ( [ vva ] ) has been regularized by performing the @xmath74-integration over a domain @xmath75 with finite volume , but with shape still not fixed .",
    "we shall see that the @xmath122-independence of the anomaly can be showed without choosing a particular shape of @xmath75 .",
    "we can now split ( [ vva ] ) in the antisymmetric and symmetric part ( respectively @xmath128 replaced with @xmath129/2 , t^b [ t^d_5 , t^c]/2 $ ] and @xmath130 ) . again",
    "the antisymmetric part does not harbour any anomaly like in the lorentz invariant case ( we shall provide an explanation below ) .",
    "therefore , we focus on the symmetric part .",
    "let us start by considering the vwis .",
    "we have j^_b(x ) j^_c(y)j^_5d(z)_anom= - e^i + \\{t^b } , [ anomvva]where again the label @xmath106 represents the anomalous part or equivalently the symmetric part and we used the identities ( k_1 + k_2 ) & = & -1 + ( p+k_2 + -m_1 ) , + ( k_1 + k_2 ) & = & -1 + ( p+k_1 - -m_1 ) .",
    "we start by considering the first and fourth terms inside the square brackets of ( [ anomvva ] ) .",
    "the trace of the integral over @xmath131 of those terms can be written as follows : i^(q ) d^4 p , [ diff]where @xmath132 and h^(p ) ( ^_5^ ) .",
    "[ hmu]the integral @xmath133 has a superficial quadratic divergence ) reveals that the divergence is only linear .",
    "however , we keep thinking that the divergence is at most quadratic in order for our argument to be applicable to other types of 3-point functions , such as the axial - axial - axial ones . ] and therefore we are not allowed to perform a shift in the integration variable and declare that ( [ diff ] ) vanishes .",
    "this is what leads to the anomaly also in the lorentz invariant case .",
    "however , our aim is to show that the anomalous part of the 3-point functions is independent of @xmath134 and to this end we substitute ( [ expansion ] ) into ( [ hmu ] ) .",
    "the terms that are at least quadratic in @xmath135 do not contribute to ( [ diff ] ) as they lower the degree of divergence of @xmath133 from quadratic to logarithmic ( a shift of the integration variable is allowed in logarithmically divergent integral ) .",
    "a priori , a non vanishing effect can be provided by the terms linear in @xmath136 , which give the following contribution to ( [ hmu ] ) h^_1(p ) ( ^_5m_1^. + + .",
    "^_5^m_1).however , it is easy to see that the linear divergence cancels in the last expression because @xmath136 contains an even does not contribute to @xmath137 for the same reason why @xmath20 does not .",
    "] number of dirac matrices and the trace of an odd number of dirac matrices vanishes .",
    "so @xmath138 is also at most logarithmically divergent and does not contribute to ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "a similar argument shows that the @xmath136 dependence in the second and third terms in the square brackets of ( [ anomvva ] ) disappears .",
    "analogous is also the treatment of the awis and therefore we do not explicitly present it here .",
    "moreover , we observe that it is possible to derive in the same way the well - known @xmath20-independence of the anomaly .",
    "the proof that the antisymmetric part of ( [ vva ] ) satisfies the wis can also be based on a quite similar reasoning . by writing down an explicit expression for the 2-point functions appearing in the wis",
    "one can easily realize that the condition for the wis to be satisfied by the antisymmetric part again coincides ) . ] with the possibility to perform a shift of the integration variable in a potentially divergent integral .",
    "since this is allowed in the @xmath139 ( lorentz invariant ) case , so it is in the @xmath140 case because extracting powers of @xmath136 necessarily lowers the degree of divergence .",
    "in the last section we have shown that the anomalous part of the 3-point functions may be taken equal to the lorentz invariant case .",
    "in other words , there are regulators for which the anomalous part is insensitive to the lorentz violating parameters",
    ". it might still be possible that such an anomaly can be canceled by adding a lorentz violating term @xmath141 $ ] to @xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath141 $ ] is a local integral of polynomials in @xmath142 and its derivatives ( counterterms ) .",
    "here we show that this is not the case and therefore the anomaly cancellation conditions remain at least as strong as in lorentz invariant theories even if we allow for lorentz violating regularizations .    from the results of section [ fermionredef ] we know",
    "that & & j^_lb(x ) j^_lc(y)j^_ld(z)_anom= + & & -(t^b_l \\{t^c_l , t^d_l } ) d^4 k_1 d^4 k_2 e^i ^ _ ( k_1+k_2)_,[anometa]where @xmath143 is defined in terms of @xmath61 appearing in ( [ divergence ] ) by means of the following relation _ _ - l^(-1)_(a_-b _ ) , [ etaalpha]with @xmath144 . to obtain ( [ anometa ] ) we used together eqs . ( [ lv - lianom ] ) , ( [ property ] ) and ( [ explicit - anom ] ) and redefinitions ( [ shift - redef ] ) and ( [ red2 ] ) . therefore , like in the lorentz invariant case ( see eq .",
    "( [ lideltaw ] ) ) , the anomalous part of @xmath37 $ ] , which is quadratic in the gauge fields , can be written as follows : w[a]_anom^(2 ) = d^4x ^ _ l _ ( 2 a_^l _ a_^l)- ( lr ) , [ 2deltaw]where label @xmath145 denotes the part quadratic in @xmath142 . regarding the left - handed part , in the lorentz invariant case this corresponds to choosing @xmath111 in ( [ explicit - anom ] ) , whereas in the general lorentz violating case to choosing _",
    "= l^(-1)_(a_-b_)+(k_1-k_2 ) in eq . ( [ anometa ] ) , where we used ( [ etaalpha ] ) .",

    "terms cubic in the gauge fields and with one derivative , 2 .",
    "terms quadratic in the gauge fields with two derivatives .",
    "therefore , a counterterm that could cancel the part of the anomaly quadratic in @xmath142 is [ a]=d^4x ( c_bcd^ _ a^b_a^c _",
    "q_(1)bc^ _ _ a^b _ a^c_+q_(2)bc^ _ a^b _ _ a^c _ ) , [ counterterms]where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are constant , but not assumed to be lorentz invariant tensors .",
    "let us start by analyzing the first term in ( [ counterterms ] ) ; after a gauge variation ( [ atransf ] ) this gives & & ( c_bcd^d^4x _ a^b_a^c _",
    "c_bcd^ d^4 x,[gaugevar ] where @xmath148 represents terms cubic in the gauge fields and we have performed some integrations by parts . if ( [ gaugevar ] ) could cancel @xmath37_{\\,anom}^{(2)}$ ] , it should be invariant under general coordinate transformations ( which are connected to the identity ) and odd under parity and time - reversal because ( [ 2deltaw ] ) has these properties .",
    "therefore , it would be not restrictive to take @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is arbitrary , in ( [ gaugevar ] ) and to start with a lorentz invariant counterterm in ( [ counterterms ] ) .",
    "a similar reasoning shows that , if we could cancel @xmath37_{\\,anom}^{(2)}$ ] , it would also be not restrictive to take @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively of the form @xmath153 and @xmath154 and therefore the corresponding terms in @xmath141 $ ] would reduce to lorentz invariant counterterms .    for this reason , in order to cancel the anomalies it is necessary to satisfy the same conditions as in lorentz invariant theories @xcite ( t_l^b\\{t^c_l , t^d_l})= ( t_r^b\\{t^c_r , t^d_r } ) , because it is required to cancel @xmath37_{\\,anom}^{(2)}$ ] . therefore , it is not possible to allow more general gauge groups and quantum numbers than those permitted in lorentz invariant theories .",
    "since our discussion is applicable to both gauge and global anomalies , we have also obtained that , whenever a global anomaly is present in a lorentz invariant theory it is also present in any lorentz violating extension of the general form considered here , namely that introduced in ref . @xcite . in these cases , the results of section [ fermionredef ]",
    "tell us that we can take the anomalous part of the triangle graphs to be equal to the lorentz invariant case .",
    "we have investigated the role of lorentz symmetry in the perturbative anomalies due to the presence of ( not necessarily dynamical ) gauge fields .",
    "the class of theories that has been considered is quite general even though some assumptions have been made ( see sections [ intro ] and [ model ] ) .",
    "the main result of the paper is that the anomaly cancellation conditions can not be relaxed by allowing lorentz violations .    to obtain this , in section [ fermionredef ]",
    "we have first considered the one - loop 3-point functions for the fermion currents derived from an action that contains general lorentz violating parameters as those in ( [ gansatz ] ) and ( [ mdef ] ) .",
    "we showed that the anomalous part of the corresponding ward identities can be taken equal to the lorentz invariant limit . in case",
    "@xmath155 ( that we called massless case ) , this property can be shown by _ ( i ) _ performing changes of variable in the integrals w.r.t . the momenta and _ ( ii ) _ redefining the labeling of the momenta carried by the internal lines .",
    "( i ) _ shows the independence of the lorentz violating parameters in the one - derivative terms in the action ( that is @xmath73 and @xmath30 ) by exploiting the invariance of the anomaly functional under general coordinate transformations , whereas step _ ( ii ) _ proves the independence of those appearing in the terms without derivatives ( that is @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "the divergent integrals have been regularized by performing the momentum integration over a finite domain . after step _ ( i ) _ , the shape of this domain can be chosen in order to reproduce the symmetric integration procedure , which is often used to compute the anomalies in standard theories . in a separate part",
    "we have considered case @xmath156 ( that we referred to as the massive case ) .",
    "the @xmath157-independence of the anomaly has been proved by extracting powers of @xmath158 from the internal propagators .",
    "such a procedure lowers the divergence of the integrals enough to render the anomaly insensitive to @xmath157 .",
    "these results may be useful to compute processes , where the anomalies are relevant , in the lorentz violating extensions considered for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method that we have just summarized appears to be applicable to other types of graphs , like the square graphs .",
    "the detailed analysis of other green functions ( different from the 3-point and 2-point functions ) would be of interest , but has not been provided here as unnecessary to obtain the main result of the paper .",
    "indeed , in section [ regulator - indep ] , we have shown that the anomalous part of the ward identities for the 3-point functions fixes @xmath37_{\\,anom}^{(2)}$ ] ( in some regularization ) equal to the lorentz invariant case and no local counterterms ( not necessarily lorentz invariant ) in the lagrangian can cancel this term after a gauge variation .",
    "so the anomaly cancellation conditions turn out to be very stable under lorentz violating perturbations .",
    "finally , given that here a perturbative method has been used and only gauge fields have been coupled to fermions , an open issue is the investigation of a similar problem , but for the non - perturbative anomalies and for theories involving gravitational interactions .",
