    "heavy - ion experiments at rhic are now analysing large quantities of data and hope to identify and characterise the plasma phase of qcd . as a result",
    "it has become imperative to put together an accurate and detailed picture of this phase from theoretical analyses of qcd at finite temperature .",
    "present day lattice computations are able to do a large part of this job .",
    "the reach of theory would certainly be enhanced if perturbation theory is tested accurately against these computations and , if found to work well , subsequently used in contexts where the lattice is too ponderous to use .",
    "the gluon sector of the qcd plasma has been extensively analysed . in the quenched theory",
    "the scaling of @xmath5 has been established to high accuracy @xcite .",
    "the continuum limit of the equation of state has also been determined to reasonably high accuracy @xcite .",
    "this shows strong departures from the ideal gas .",
    "it turns out that hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummation is not sufficient for a description of the lattice results @xcite , nor is a borel resummation of the perturbative series @xcite .",
    "other techniques such as an approximately self - consistent resummation @xcite and dimensional reduction @xcite have been applied , and the former has been successful in describing the lattice results for @xmath6 . in addition , the spectrum of screening masses in the qcd plasma has been determined to good accuracy @xcite and , for @xmath6 , found to be in agreement with that determined non - perturbatively from a dimensionally reduced model whose couplings are matched perturbatively to the four - dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "there is also direct evidence for the existence of the gluon as a quasiparticle in the plasma for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the quark sector of the theory has not yet been explored in as much detail .",
    "part of the reason is that lattice computations with light sea quarks are very expensive .",
    "while sea quarks are needed in the neighbourhood of the phase transition , where they influence even the order of the transition , sufficiently far away their effects are seen to be small @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on the physics of valence quarks in the continuum limit of qcd for @xmath8@xmath9 , where sea quark effects are marginal .",
    "the two aspects we concentrate on are quark number susceptibilities @xcite and screening correlators and masses .",
    "quark number susceptibilities @xcite now occupy a position of high interest . due to their connection with fluctuation phenomena @xcite and",
    "strangeness production @xcite they are useful inputs to relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "they are coefficients of the taylor expansion of the free energy density of qcd in terms of the chemical potential , and hence are useful checks on recent attempts at numerical studies of finite - density qcd @xcite . for exactly the same reason they are a test - bed for suggested resummations of the high - temperature perturbation series for qcd , which aim to reproduce the free energy density , and hence the equation of state , at high temperatures @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report our study of these susceptibilities at a large variety of lattice spacings and an extraction of their continuum limit .",
    "screening correlators and masses are closely related to linear response functions such as susceptibilities .",
    "they have been explored earlier at finite lattice spacings , @xmath1@xmath10 .",
    "staggered quarks were used in 4 flavour @xcite , 2 flavour @xcite and quenched @xcite simulations . for reasons of symmetry a large degeneracy of screening masses , of the zero temperature scalar ( s ) , pseudo - scalar ( ps ) , and certain components of the vector ( v ) and axial - vector ( av ) quark bilinears , is expected in the qcd plasma @xcite .",
    "this was not observed ; instead lesser degeneracies were between parity partners s and ps or v and av .",
    "similar results were also obtained with overlap @xcite and wilson @xcite quarks in quenched qcd , though the splitting between the s / ps and v / av sectors was seen to be substantially smaller . here",
    "we study these correlators on a wide range of lattice spacings and extrapolate the results to the continuum .    in this paper",
    "we carefully address the question of the continuum limit of these quantities in the quenched qcd plasma , where the valence quarks are used as probes of the dynamics of gluons . to this end",
    "we perform quenched computations over a range of temperatures and a large range of lattice spacings , in order to perform a continuum extrapolation .",
    "we test the extrapolation by working with two different formulations of quarks on the lattice , with different systematics at finite lattice spacing .",
    "one is the normal staggered formulation of quarks , the other a symanzik improved version of staggered quarks , called naik quarks @xcite . by this",
    "means we identify a unique and verifiable continuum limit .",
    "we would like to distinguish our approach from symanzik ( or loop level ) improvement of the action @xcite .",
    "such programs aim to approach the continuum limit of the action on coarse lattices by adding terms to the action which systematically , order by order in the lattice spacing @xmath11 , remove lattice artifacts up to some sufficiently high order in @xmath11 .",
    "when such a scheme is used in conjunction with improved operators , it ( ideally ) obviates any need to go to very fine lattice spacings . in this work",
    "we only use an improved operator for the valence quarks ; the action is not improved .",
    "we reach the continuum limit by simulations on a variety of lattice spacings and a smooth extrapolation .    in the next section we present definitions of all the quantities that we measure , and results for these quantities for ideal quark gases on a lattice . in section 3",
    "we present details of the simulations and measurement schemes .",
    "the following section contains detailed results on the lattice with discussion of the extrapolation to the continuum .",
    "the continuum extrapolations are collected and discussed in the final section .",
    "the partition function of qcd with three quark flavours is z(t,_u,_d,_s ) = u _ f = u , d , sm(t , m_f,_f ) , [ part]where the temperature @xmath4 determines the size of the euclidean time direction , @xmath12 is the gluon part of the action , and the determinant of the dirac operator , @xmath13 , contains as parameters the quark masses , @xmath14 , and the chemical potentials , @xmath15 for flavours @xmath16 .",

    "the susceptibilities can be non - vanishing .",

    "the flavour diagonal susceptibilities have contributions from both quark - line connected and disconnected pieces _",
    "[ chis]we draw attention to the fact that the last two terms individually grow rapidly with lattice volume , diverging in the infinite volume limit , such that the difference is a finite quantity .",
    "this cancellation of divergences is the result of a proper treatment of quark chemical potentials on the lattice @xcite .",
    "numerically , the simplest quantity to evaluate is the diagonal isovector susceptibility _ 3 = t2v ( m_u^-1 m_u  - m_u^-1m_um_u^-1m_u ) , [ chi3]where the factor half takes care of the isospin carried by each flavour .",
    "in addition to this , we shall need the baryon number and electric charge susceptibilities _ 0 = 19(4_3+_s+4_ud+4_us ) _ q = 19(10_3+_s+_ud-2_us ) .",
