    "the dynamical properties of solids with strong anharmonicity are often usefully studied by specifying the constraints on the atoms rather than the forces between them .",
    "this approach has yielded interesting results in phenomena ranging from the properties of interfaces @xcite to criteria for glass - formation @xcite to rigidity percolation @xcite in solids with `` floppy modes '' .",
    "we consider here the problem of lattices in which some ( strongly anharmonic ) bonds can be deformed at a much lower energy than the others .",
    "as noted below the problem is of wide interest but our attention to it is drawn by the @xmath0 in volume of a class of solids @xmath1 as temperature is increased , in a range of temperature which in some cases extends from @xmath2 10k to the highest measured temperature @xcite .",
    "conventional perturbative calculations with anharmonic potentials are not very helpful in this case .",
    "these solids have a complicated lattice structure but always contain polyhedra which share some or all corners with the neighbors .",
    "any distortion of the polyhedra is expensive , the vibrations changing the angles between the polyhedra however have low energies @xmath3 @xmath4 a simple model can be constructed to show the phenomena of thermal contraction in such cases . a two - dimensional version is shown in fig .",
    "1a , which consist of a solid with three squares per unit cell , two of which are connected only at two corners ( these can be replaced by sticks of fixed length ) while the third is connected at all four corners @xcite .",
    "all bond - lengths as well as the internal right - angles of the squares are constrained to be fixed .",
    "the only independent variable is the angle @xmath5 between the squares .",
    "the area occupied by the solid is the sum of the area occupied by the solid squares and the area between them .",
    "the latter are bounded by perimeters whose length are fixed . under this condition",
    "the area is least when the perimeter has the highest symmetry , i. e. in the configuration shown in fig",
    "any variation in @xmath6 must then necessarily lead to a reduction in volume . for the unit cell shown , the area decreases as @xmath7 .",
    "we expect @xmath8 for @xmath9 , giving the observed behavior @xcite .",
    "the above is the correct dimensional argument for the thermal contraction , but it should be clear that @xmath10 s in different cells are coupled , and coupled non - locally to the strain .",
    "the coupling of translational and rotational degrees of freedom leads in the continuum limit to a field - theoretical problem with some remarkable features . besides the thermal contraction",
    ", we have found that the shear modes have zero stiffness in such solids and that they have rotational modes with dispersion characterestic of free particles : @xmath11 .",
    "these features are also present in three - dimensional versions of the model and are expected also to hold in more general models than studied here .",
    "a convenient set of variables for the problem are the position of the four corners of each square @xmath12 , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the coordinate of the center of the square @xmath12 and @xmath15 label each corner ( see fig .",
    "1b ) . fixing the lengths and the internal right - angles of the squares ,",
    "the relatives positions @xmath16 can be expressed as functions of the angle @xmath5 alone , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a fixed length .",
    "the original 8 degrees of freedom per unit cell are then reduced to 3 @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the displacement of the center of mass of the squares around the equilibrium position at @xmath21 .",
    "two more constraints per unit cell come from fixing the lengths of each connecting stick ( or square ) ;    @xmath22    the labels @xmath23 , and @xmath24 represent the neighbors of the cell @xmath12 .    in any distortion about the symmetric position , the two - diagonals in each square change angle with respect to the connecting sticks .",
    "the potential energy may be expressed in terms of the four such angles per unit cell , @xmath25 @xmath26 may be written in terms of the vectors @xmath27 .",
    "for example @xmath28    in the continuum limit @xmath29 @xmath30 ( @xmath31 , the potential energy simplifies to @xmath32 ds   \\label{v}\\ ] ]    note that terms quadratic in @xmath33 do not occur in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) . this equation can be written as : @xmath34 ds . \\label{vbis}\\ ] ] the rotational invariance of eqs .",
    "( [ v ] ) and ( [ vbis ] ) will be evident only after the constraints of eq .",
    "( [ cons ] ) are implemented .",
    "the kinetic energy is @xmath35 which in the continuum limit becomes @xmath36    to obtain the continuum version of the constraints of eq.(1 ) , consider all the four sticks connecting any given square to its neighbors .",
    "the four equations can be written as    @xmath37    where , @xmath38    these four equations determine the four components of the strain tensor @xmath33 .",
    "we have found that these constraints are satisfied to @xmath39 by two sets of relations , as may be verified by substitution    set i : @xmath40 set ii : @xmath41    where @xmath42and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are arbitrary real functions of order @xmath45 or higher .",
    "these relations relates the deformation of the _ unit cell _ with @xmath10 .",
    "for set i the first term on the right side rigidily rotates each unit cell by @xmath10 , a uniform @xmath10 gives a rigid rotation of the entire solid .",
    "the second term on the right hand allows a smooth spatial variation of @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "the deformation for the set ii are shown in fig . 1b . in these optical - like modes the connecting stick rotates by @xmath46 and the cell contracts @xmath47 in each direction .",
    "now we determine the equation of motion for each set of solutions .",
    "( [ set1 ] ) can be combined in the form @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 are thus the sources determining the irrotational and solenoidal parts of @xmath51 .",
    "the other two equations obtained from eqs.([set1 ] ) are that the shear strain @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . for results at long wavelengths",
    "these can be equated to zero . _",
    "the model thus has zero shear - velocity_.    with eqs .",
    "( [ set1 ] ) , it is straight forward to show that @xmath54    the absence of terms proportional to @xmath45 in ( [ v1 ] ) has important consequences .",
    "their absence may be traced to the local invariance satisfied by ( [ j1 ] ) : @xmath55 corrections to eq .",
    "( [ inv ] ) are of @xmath56 .",
    "consider next the equation of motion for @xmath57 . to do this @xmath51 in the kinetic energy @xmath58",
    "must be expressed in terms of the sources @xmath59 , @xmath50 . noting that @xmath60 the equation of motion for @xmath61 to linear order associated with set i is found to satisfy the energy - wave vector relation @xmath62 the last term comes from @xmath63 .",
    "( [ disp ] ) yields the interesting result that at long - wave - length , free - particle like modes exist for which @xmath64 .",
    "the physical reason for the existence of such rotational mode lies in the local invariance ( [ inv ] ) and the fact that rotation of the entire solid ( @xmath65 ) involves transporting macroscopic mass . at long - wavelengths",
    "the effective mass is @xmath66 the characterestic frequency below which the dispersion of the modes is proportional to @xmath67 , determined by looking at corrections of @xmath68 in eq.([disp ] ) , is @xmath69 .    for set ii the potential energy",
    "is given by @xmath70\\ ds\\ ] ]    and the equations for the sources of the fields for @xmath71 and @xmath72 are , respectively @xmath73    the contribution of the source - fields to the kinetic energy is now @xmath74 and does not change the equation of motion for @xmath57 which give the expected optical - like dispersion relation @xmath75 to linear order @xmath76 do not enter in the dispersion .",
    "since the problem has only one degree of freedom per unit cell , the free - particle like and the optical - like modes are not linearly independent .",
    "this may be seen through fig .",
    "the free - particle like modes can be locally thought of as composed of a rotation by @xmath77 and a @xmath78 optical mode of amplitude @xmath79 the sharing of the spectral weight between collective modes in non - linear problem is known in other contexts .",
    "now we come to the question of thermal compression with which we started .",
    "the equilibrium volume of the lattice at a temperature t may be determined from the thermal expectation value @xmath80 from eqs .",
    "( [ j1 ] ) and ( [ j2 ] ) , we note that both sets of modes contribute to the thermal contraction at all temperatures which to the order of the theory here is proportional to the expectation value @xmath81 .",
    "for t larger than @xmath82 the thermal contraction may then be determined by the equipartition theorem to be proportional to t. the thermal contraction is entropic akin to that of rubber .",
    "the problem can be extended to 3 dimensions replacing the squares by octahedra and adding an extra stick per cell which connects the corners of neighboring octahedra in the @xmath83 direction .",
    "the model has a cubic symmetry . for a fixed size of the octahedra the 6 degrees of freedom per unit cell ( 3 translation and 3 rotations )",
    "are reduced to 3 by fixing the length of the sticks ( analogues of eq.(1 ) ) .",
    "the coordinates of the 6 vertices of each octahedron can again be expressed as @xmath84 , with @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 represent the three rotations by the euler angles @xmath90 , @xmath10 and @xmath91 @xcite .    the 3 constraints in the continuum limit can be expressed in the same form as eq .",
    "( [ ab0 ] ) , where now @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 are three component vectors , @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the unit vector in the @xmath97 direction and @xmath98 , indicate the corresponding corners of the octahedra .",
    "once again the shear velocities are zero .",
    "also we again get two sets of solutions .",
    "set i :    @xmath99    note that @xmath100 are functions of the euler angles , then again eqs .",
    "( [ set13d ] ) give the deformation of each unit cell as a function of the euler angles .",
    "the potential energy can be found analogous to the 2d case ( eq . [ v1 ] ) and results    @xmath101 dv\\ ] ]    with @xmath102 the absence of a mass term is again due to an equations analogous to eqs .",
    "( [ inv ] ) .",
    "we again obtain 3 modes with @xmath103 for reasons similar to the 2-dimensional case .    for set ii @xmath104    where is an arbitrary vector satisfying @xmath105 .",
    "from here it can be derived the three optical modes .",
    "we have also considered the simple the model in which the sticks connecting the rigid polyhedra ( squares in 2-dimension ) have finite elasticity , i.e. the constraints of eqs .",
    "( [ cons ] ) are not imposed .",
    "the model then has of course the usual longitudinal and transverse modes at long wavelengths .",
    "the results obtained above can not be obtained in any limit of the parameteres of such harmonic model as a pertubative expansion about them .",
    "the constraints lead to qualitativaly new class of properties .",
    "these properties are preserved if wegeneralize the sticks in fig . ( 2 ) to a polymer , i.e. with a chain of fixed length sticks deformable in the mutual orientation at the connecting points .",
    "the model investigated is especially interesting in some unfamiliar contexts .",
    "it has direct application to sintered solids @xcite , where rigid particles are connected to each other through bonds with small energies for angular variations although the model needs to be generalised to take into account the random placements of the bonds .",
    "the predictions for zero or very small shear velocity and of long wavelength rotational modes is expected to hold generally and should be tested in that case .",
    "some models for granular solids@xcite are related to the model studied here again with generalisation to the random placing of the bonds .",
    "the prediction of zero shear velocity obtained here is particularly interesting in connection with granular materials because they flow like a liquid.@xcite of - course to examine flow the model must also be generalised to allow for `` bond - breaking '' .",
    "the model studied here is also a particular example of general models discussed by s. alexander @xcite with potential applications to unusual excitation modes in glasses and foams .",
