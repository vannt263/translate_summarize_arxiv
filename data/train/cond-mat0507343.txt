    "recently there has been a considerable scientific and technological interest in the formation of nano - crystalline / quasicrystalline phase in the @xmath13 alloys by mechanical milling [ 1 ] .",
    "quasicrystals have many properties which make them interesting for industrial applications like light weight , large strength to weight ratio and high hardness with a low frictional coefficient [ 2 ] .",
    "nanostructured material , which can be defined as a material with the crystallite size less than @xmath14 are synthesized by either bottom - up or top - down processes [ 3 ] .",
    "the bottom up approach starts with atoms , ions or molecules as building blocks and assembles nanoscale clusters or bulk material from them .",
    "the top down approach for processing of nanostructured materials starts with bulk solid and ends in obtaining a nano ostructured phase through special processing routes e.g. mechanical milling , re - solidification through chemical methods etc .",
    "nano - phase materials have significantly different behaviour from their macroscopic counterparts because their sizes are smaller than the characteristic length scales of physical phenomena occurring in bulk materials [ 4 ] .",
    "the nanostructure materials are produced by using various methods , among which high - energy ball milling ( bm ) which is also known as mechanical milling ( mm ) has attracted much attention [ 5 ] .",
    "the advantages of high - energy ball milling for the synthesis of nano - structured materials are the formation of a more homogeneous product and good reproducibility [ 6 ] .",
    "the mechanical milling technique has been used to obtain amorphous alloys [ 7 ] , high coercively permanent magnetic metallic compounds [ 8 ] and quasicrystals [ 9 - 10 ] .",
    "the formation of a quasicrystalline phase by bm / mm has been reported in a number of @xmath15 and @xmath16 based systems [ 11 ] .",
    "recently mukhopadhyay et al [ 12 ] have studied the effect of mechanical milling on the stability of @xmath15-rich , @xmath13 and @xmath17 quasicrystalline alloys .",
    "they have reported that the icosahedral quasicrystalline phase in @xmath13 system undergoes transformation to a bcc ( b2 type ) crystalline phase as a result of ball milling [ 13 ] . in this case",
    ", b2 phase does not transform into any other crystalline / quasicrystalline phase during isothermal annealing at 850@xmath8 up to 20h .",
    "it has been concluded that the b2 phase is more stable than the icosahedral quasicrystalline phase at those compositions .",
    "it should be mentioned that @xmath15-rich @xmath18 system is of significant interest due to the high temperature structural stability of icosahedral quasicrystalline phase .",
    "the available phase equilibria data indicate that the b2 phase is a major phase on the @xmath15-deficient side of stoichiometry [ 14 ] .",
    "the b2 structure can be understood in term of ordering in a bcc lattice and converting it to be a simple cubic lattice .",
    "therefore , unlike a bcc lattice , one type of atom occupies the body - centered position and another type occupies the cube corners in the ordered lattice . when the composition deviates from the stoichiometry , the compositional defects must be introduced to preserve the crystal structure .",
    "its unit cell contains two different atoms located respectively at the vertex and at the center of the cube .",
    "it is one of the basic simple structures that can transform into more complex structures via twinning at the atomic level , termed as chemical twinning [ 15 ] .",
    "the b2 type phase is often present together with the quasicrystals and has fixed coherent orientation relationship with the latter [ 16 - 17 ] .",
    "the detailed investigation of the b2 phase is also important due to its practical applications [ 18 - 19 ] .",
    "though quasicrystals have many curious properties , they are also extremely brittle , porous and composition - sensitive . it is therefore interesting to substitute them by approximant materials , particularly b2 based ones , which are more easily prepared and have similar performance characteristics [ 20 ] .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to investigate the influence of high - energy ball milling on the phase stability , crystallite size , lattice strain and lattice parameter of b2 phase formed in the pre - alloyed @xmath19 sample .",
    "present investigation clearly shows the evolution of ordered simple cubic phase ( @xmath20 ) and as well as fcc ( @xmath21 ) @xmath22 phase after milling followed by annealing . the evolution of the nano - structure at different stages of ball milling has also been investigated .",
    "an alloy of composition @xmath19 was prepared by melting the high purity @xmath23 and @xmath24 metals in an induction furnace , in the presence of dry argon atmosphere .",
    "the ingot formed was re - melted several times to ensure better homogeneity .",
    "the as - cast ingot was crushed to particles less than @xmath25 mm in size and placed in an attritor ball mill ( szegvari attritor ) with a ball to powder weight ratio of @xmath26 .",
    "the attritor has a cylindrical stainless steel tank of inner diameter @xmath27 and the angular speed of mill was maintained at 400 rpm .",
    "the milling operation was conducted from 5 to 80h using hexane as a process control agent .",
    "the powder obtained after @xmath28 and @xmath29 of milling were annealed isothermally at @xmath30 for 5 to @xmath31 in the evacuated quartz capsules ( with vacuum of @xmath32 @xmath33 ) .",
    "the milled and heat - treated powders were characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a philips 1710 x - ray diffractometer with @xmath34 radiation . the effective crystallite size and relative strain of mechanically milled powders as well as heat - treated products",
    "were calculated based on line broadening of xrd peaks .",
    "the use of the voigt function for the analysis of the integral breadths of broadened x - ray diffraction line profiles forms the basis of a rapid and powerful single line method of crystallite - size and strain determination . in this case",
    "the constituent couchy and gaussian components can be obtained from the ratio of full width at half maximum intensity(@xmath35 ) and integral breadth ( @xmath36 ) [ 21 ] . in a single line analysis",
    "the apparent crystallite size d and strain e can be related to couchy ( @xmath37 ) and gaussian ( @xmath38 ) widths of the diffraction peak at the bragg angle ; @xmath39    and @xmath40    the constituent couchy and gassian components can be given as @xmath41    @xmath42\\beta\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are couchy constants @xmath45 and @xmath46 are gassian constants and @xmath47 is @xmath48 where @xmath36 is the integral breadth obtained from xrd peak . the value of couchy and gassian constant have taken from the table of langford [ 21 ]    @xmath49    @xmath50    from these , we have calculated the crystallite size d and the lattice strain e for the milled @xmath19 powders .",
    "the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns for the @xmath19 alloy obtained after various milling durations has been shown in figure 1 .",
    "curve ( a ) shows the b2 phase obtained from the as - cast ingot material and curve ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) are the xrd patterns from the powder milled for @xmath51 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "it can be seen from fig.1 that the peak corresponding to the ( 110 ) profiles of the b2 phase becomes broader and the intensity gets reduced with increasing milling time .",
    "these two effects are mainly attributed to the increase of the internal lattice strain and reduction of the grain size .",
    "the evolution of the nano crystalline phase in @xmath19 can be easily noticed from the increase in the broadening of x - ray diffraction lines ( fig.1 ) during different period of ball milling .",
    "it should be noted that the shift of the peaks towards lower @xmath52 angle side with the increase in milling time indicates the increase in lattice parameter .",
    "intensity of ( 110 ) peak goes on decreasing with increasing milling time .",
    "after @xmath29 of milling , a diffuse broad peak appears indicating the transformation of the b2 phase to an amorphous phase .",
    "( see fig .",
    "xrd pattern clearly indicates that the initial sharp diffraction lines get considerably broadened after ball milling , suggesting that the nano - crystalline phase appears as a result of milling .    to study the effect of annealing on the mm powders , the samples milled for 10 hrs and 80hrs were subjected to annealing for various time periods .",
    "2 ( a ) , ( b),(c ) and ( d ) show the xrd pattern obtained after @xmath53 of ball milling followed by annealing at @xmath30 for @xmath54 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "the xrd patterns corresponding to @xmath28 and @xmath31 , the annealed samples ( fig.2 ( b , c ) ) have been indexed using simple a cubic structure with @xmath55 . the most interesting feature to be noted is that these samples show cubic structure , which is a superstructure of the b2 phase .",
    "the lattice parameters of the superstructure phase and b2 phase are interrelated as @xmath56 , where @xmath12 is the lattice parameter of the b2 phase which is a parent phase .",
    "the formation of the superstructure due to the ball milling and subsequent annealing has been observed for the first time in @xmath13 alloy .",
    "we propose a structural model for this new superstructure of b2 phase .",
    "3 shows the structural model of superstructure with lattice parameter @xmath57 times of b2 phase ( @xmath58 ) , which is obtained from the powder after ball milling for 10 h and subsequent annealing at 500@xmath8 for @xmath31 .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows two - dimensional model of superstructure , which clearly indicates that the face diagonal of a cube is playing a key role for the formation of the superstructure of b2 phase .",
    "the three dimensional model ( fig .",
    "3(b ) ) clearly depicts the unit cell of the superstructure of the b2 phase .",
    "the edge of the unit cell is the diagonal of a cube face ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the lattice parameter of the superstructure phase , which is calculated from the model , exactly matches with the lattice parameter obtained from xrd of 10h ball milled and 20h - annealed powders .",
    "4 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) and ( d ) show the xrd patterns corresponding to @xmath3 ball milled @xmath19 powders annealed at 500@xmath8 for 0 , 5 , 10 and @xmath31 respectively . in the case of @xmath31 annealing",
    ", the sample has been cooled slowly to avoid the quenching effects and detect any transformation during cooling .",
    "unlike the sample milled for @xmath28 and annealed at 500@xmath8 for 10/20 h , the xrd pattern shown in fig.4 ( d ) could be indexed only in terms of a fcc structure with @xmath60 . however , the lattice parameter of this fcc phase is also related to b2 phase as @xmath61 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath22 phases in 80 h ball milled and 20h annealed powder can easily be explained by the structural model shown in fig.5 .",
    "we propose two - dimensional geometrical model as outlined for the formation of @xmath22 phases from the present b2 phase .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows the relationship between quasicrystllaine and related crystalline ( @xmath22 ) phases .",
    "the model is based on the concept of a polytope and an eight dimensional root lattice .",
    "its basic atomic cluster forms a cuboctahedron with 12 vertices formed by intersection of three perpendicular squares with edge length of @xmath62 .",
    "this polyhedron is transformed into an icosahedron when the squares are changed into rectangles with edge length ratio of @xmath63 .",
    "the properties of the eight dimensional root lattice give foundation to the possibility of mapping a quasicrystllaine structure on a crystalline structure .",
    "the proposed geometrical model can be applied also to the polymorphoic bcc - fcc transformation",
    "on the basis of our present investigation it may be conclude that , the formation of the nano b2 phase starts after 5h of milling and gets completed after 40h of milling . beyond 40h of milling",
    "the amorphous phase starts forming and the sample shows the coexistence of nano - crystalline and amorphous phases .",
    "after 80h of milling nano b2 phase transforms to amorphous phase completely . the @xmath19 samples ball milled for 10h and 80h and",
    "annealed subsequently at 500@xmath8 for 20h , transform to the simple cubic ( @xmath64 ) and the fcc ( @xmath65 ) phases respectively .",
