    "the problem of distributed estimation is one of very active topics in the modern control theory and signal processing literature .",
    "interest in this problem is motivated by a growing number of applications where a decision about the observed process must be made simultaneously by spatially distributed sensors , each taking partial measurements of the process .",
    "when the process and measurements are subject to noise and disturbance , robustness aspects of the problem come into prominence . in the past several years",
    ", a number of results have been presented in the literature which develop the @xmath0 control and estimation theory for distributed systems subject to uncertain perturbations ; e.g. , see  @xcite . in particular , methodologies of distributed sampled - data @xmath0 filtering have been considered , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "that reference emphasized several distinctive aspects of realistic sensor networks , among them coupling between sensor nodes through the information communicated between neighbouring sensor nodes and the sampled nature of that coupling , which is dictated by the digital communication technology .",
    "the latter feature of sampled data networks is an important consideration in any network design , because the amount of information that can be transmitted to / received at each node of the network is constrained , due to data rate limitations of digital communication channels .    in this paper",
    "we address some of the challenges specific to round - robin type communication protocols .",
    "the round - robin protocol is a commonly used protocol for information transmission in networked control systems .",
    "it allows each node to communicate with its neighbours intermittently , during scheduled time slots and is known to lead to bandwidth savings . from a hybrid systems perspective",
    "this protocol has been studied in details in  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been considered in the context of time - delay systems in  @xcite , where an analysis of exponential stability and @xmath1 properties of networked control systems with round - robin scheduling was presented using a delay switching system modeling . in this paper",
    ", we further develop this technique in the context of robust distributed estimation with intermittent communications between sensing nodes .",
    "the type of communication we consider is where the nodes broadcast their information at every scheduled time instant to all nodes in their vicinity , but they listen to only one node within their neighbourhood at a time , according to the round - robin rule . for instance , this can be achieved by encoding the transmitted information with a node - specific key .",
    "i.e. , when node @xmath2 receives signals from multiple sources , it extracts the information sent by node @xmath3 by utilizing the key of that node , and continues doing this by rotating the keys .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop an algorithm for synthesis of a round - robin type protocol for a network of distributed observers , to allow this network to track dynamics of a linear uncertain plant . unlike many existing approaches to distributed estimation",
    ", the salient feature of our methodology is that individual estimators may not be able to track the plant , if they rely solely on their own measurements , because the plant may not be observable from the node s measurements .",
    "this issue has recently been emphasized in  @xcite which demonstrated that consensus between sensors plays a crucial role in enabling individual sensor nodes to overcome lack of detectability and successfully track the plant .",
    "necessary conditions on the network to ensure the plant is detectable / observable by the network have recently been presented in  @xcite .",
    "the first contribution of this paper is a version of the protocol of  @xcite to be used with the distributed estimation schemes proposed  @xcite .",
    "we show that instead of continuously exchanging information ( the type of networks considered in those references ) , the node observers can achieve the relative @xmath0 consensus objective by exchanging information at certain sampling times , by polling one neighbour at a time .",
    "it is assumed that sampling times are known and agreed upon at each node .",
    "technically , this would require all nodes to have their clocks synchronized , e.g. , by means of a network time protocol @xcite .",
    "our second contribution demonstrates that the round - robin design of  @xcite can be applied to derive a network of non - switching observers .",
    "of course , each observer periodically switches between input channels , but the observer gains remain unchanged .",
    "this is an important feature of our methodology to ensure its scalability . in a large network of distributed estimators",
    ", switching of observer gains typically leads to a combinatorially complex scheduling problem , and necessitates development of additional tools to resolve this complexity ; see  @xcite .",
    "we show that these issues are avoidable in observer networks of the type considered in this paper .",
    "our main result is a sufficient condition , expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities ( lmis ) , from which filter and interconnection gains for each node estimator can be computed , to ensure the network of sampled data observers using switching communications converges to the trajectory of the observed plant by achieving consensus between the filters at every node .",
    "conditions for consensus of multi - agent systems using sampled data communications or systems communicating over switching graphs are well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "this includes an observation that the sampling period has a significant effect on the system performance  @xcite .",
    "as the example presented in section  [ example ] illustrates , our conditions allow to investigate the effects of intermittent sampled communications on the system performance as well . at the same time , our result provides a guarantee of the network consensus performance in the presence of disturbances .",
    "since consensus between observers is essential for the network to be able to overcome observability / detectability limitations of individual observers  @xcite , consensus performance is seen as an important design consideration which the results in this paper address .    as in  @xcite ,",
    "our methodology relies on certain vector dissipativity properties of the large - scale system comprised of the observers error dynamics .",
    "however , different form these references , to establish these vector dissipativity properties , we employ a novel class of generalized supply rates which reflect the sampled - data nature of interconnections between observers .",
    "the general idea behind introducing such generalized supply rates can be traced to  @xcite ( also , see  @xcite ) , but our proposal here makes use of special properties of sampled signals . in the limit , when the maximum sampling period approaches zero , these generalized supply rate vanish , and one recovers the vector dissipativity properties of error dynamics established in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the feasibility of the conditions proposed for systems with continuously operating interconnections can be used as a preliminary ( but not conclusive ) test for the conditions proposed here .",
    "our numerical example illustrates this point very well , showing a negligible difference between the disturbance attenuation levels obtained using the benchmark algorithm of  @xcite and those obtained using our conditions under small sampling rate . at the same time",
    ", the feasibility of our conditions makes explicit the dependence of the proposed algorithm on the sampling period .",
    "being only sufficient conditions , our conditions are potentially conservative , but the fact that the techniques used in the derivation of these conditions showed substantial reduction of conservatism in similar problems  @xcite is encouraging .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the problem formulation , along with the graph theory preliminaries is presented in section  [ formulation ] .",
    "the main results of the paper are given in section  [ main ] .",
    "in section  [ example ] , we discuss an illustrative example , and section  [ concl ] concludes the paper .

    "the distributed filtering problem under consideration is to estimate the state of the system ( [ eq : plant ] ) using a network of filters connected according to the graph @xmath28 .",
    "each node takes measurements @xmath52 @xmath53 is a measurement disturbance .",
    "as seen from ( [ u6.yi ] ) , the measurements are assumed to be taken continuously .",
    "although in practice , measurements are usually taken at discrete time instances , we assume that the data rate of the sensors is high enough to allow for the continuous - time interpretation of the measurement signals @xmath54 .",
    "this will enable us to focus exclusively on the effects due to sampling and intermittence of interconnections .",
    "the measurements are processed by a network of observers connected over the graph @xmath28 .",
    "the key assumption in this paper is to allow the observers make use of their local measurements continuously , however they can only interact with each other at discrete time instances @xmath55 , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 . for simplicity , we assume that this schedule of updates is known to all participants in the network , and therefore all nodes exchange information at the same time instance @xmath55 . however , at every time instance @xmath55 only one neighbour in the set @xmath25 is polled by each node @xmath2 , according to the ` round - robin ' rule .",

    "the last term in ( [ up7.c.d ] ) reflects the desire of each node observer to update its estimate of the plant using feedback from the neighbours in its neighbourhood , according to the consensus estimation paradigm  @xcite .",
    "however , unlike these references , under the proposed protocol , only one neighbour is polled at each time @xmath55 to provide a ` neighbour feedback ' , and this sample is stored and used by the observer until time @xmath72 .",
    "the feature of the proposed round - robin type protocol is to poll the neighbours one at a time , in a cyclic manner .",
    "formally , this can be described by first applying the shift permutation operator @xmath73 to the neighbourhood set at every time instance @xmath55 , and then selecting the first element from the resulting permutation @xmath37 for feedback .",
