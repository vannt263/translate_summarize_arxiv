    "for relatively small values of parameter @xmath63 the rarefaction wave front reaches the cloud center before the formation of a central singularity .",

    "hence the further collapse can be sufficiently decelerated and can even pass to slower quasi - hydrostatic contraction with formation of some stable object at final stages of cloud evolution ( e.g. , a _ neutron star _ ) .",
