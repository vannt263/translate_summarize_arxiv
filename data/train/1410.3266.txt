    "the earth s atmosphere absorbs and scatters uv photons preventing observations of the active universe .",
    "uv - emitting phenomena are generally associated with high - energy activity : massive star formation , hot transients such as supernovae ( sne ) , which are uv bright for hours to days , variability of agn , where the amplitude of the variability usually increases at shorter wavelengths , variable stars such as m - dwarfs with uv - flaring activity on time scales of hundreds of seconds , and flashes from cosmic collisions which can be very energetic on all scales .",
    "the uv range is a critical tool for classifying and studying these hot transients .",
    "tidal disruption events ( tdes ) by massive black holes give rise to yet another source of flares in the uv , where the object can continue to be uv bright for months . a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) at the centre of a typical galaxy disrupts a main sequence ( ms ) star every @xmath2@xmath3 years ( e.g. alexander 2005 ; gezari et al .",
    "2009 ) , and a planet as often as that or even more considering that the expected number of free - floating planets exceeds the number of stars by at least two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "more than a thousand exoplanets are now known ( about 1800 planets confirmed and more than 3800 waiting for confirmation at time of writing with more than a third of them being young systems with host ages of less than 3 gyr ( schekinov et al . 2014 ) . in such systems collisions at all scales are possible : planet - planet , planet - star and collisions of smaller objects / debris ( planetesimals , asteroids , comets ) which result in flashes and flares peaking in the extreme - uv ( euv)/uv . even in our own solar system , there are a large number of asteroidal collisions which create rock fragments of all sizes that subsequently impact planets .",
    "for example , an impact on the asteroid vesta has been identified as the most probable cause of he d meteorites ( howardite , eucrite , diogenite class of achondrites ) influencing the near - earth space ( see pieters et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "recent cataclysmic events such as the shoemaker - levy 9 ( sl-9 ) comet impact on jupiter and the 2013 chelyabinsk meteor crash in russia ( the most probable parent of this @xmath4 tons and 18-m diameter bolide is the shattered pha 2011 eo40 , which has a possible family of up to 20 asteroids of different sizes ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2012 ) , have renewed attention to such threats .",
    "earth is constantly bombarded from space .",
    "meteoroids of size from tens of cms and larger enter the earth s atmosphere on daily to monthly basis .",
    "if they are smaller than some tens of metres , they ablate before reaching the ground . an object with a mass of 10,000 kg collides with earth approximately every 15 years .",
    "though at present there are approximately 620,000 asteroids that are tracked in our solar system , this number is less than one percent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun and less than @xmath5 of all near - earth objects ( neo ) have been discovered ( yeomans 2013 ) .",
    "moreover , while neo - participating observatories look for them in the northern hemisphere ( such as e.g. , palomar transient factory , the catalina sky survey , pan - starrs and skymapper ) , not much is done in the south ( the only one observatory in the southern hemisphere - at siding spring , australia - has reduced its operations to only occasional observations due to budget cuts , and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) is still some years away from operation ) . the best way to find possible impactors",
    " potentially hazardous asteroids ( pha ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] )  would be to put a space wide - field near - ir telescope to look outward from the orbit of venus .",
    "but the second best , as compared to the more affordable leo space telescopes , is the moon .",
    "this would allow observing the incoming objects on their last part of the trajectory before impacting .",
    "although not useful for early warning , this information would be helpful in understanding the early stage of the interaction of an incoming body with the outermost layers of the atmosphere .",
    "the moon was first proposed by astronomers as a prime site for large telescopes nearly 50 years ago ( tifft 1966 ) .",
    "essential absence of atmosphere and ionosphere offered an unobstructed view of the space in all wavelengths , and lunar surface and low gravity offered a stable platform on which to build large telescopes .",
    "the moon has several advantages and disadvantages as a base for astronomical observatories , thus scientists can not come to a consensus about the benefits of using the moon as a site for deep space astronomy ( e.g. , brosch 2009 ) .",
    "on the one hand , in the near - vacuum of the moon , there are no atmospheric related problems like opacity , thermal conductivity , wind , and seeing .",
    "observations can be made continuously , provided that a telescope is shielded from the sun and has constant power supply .",
    "the lunar regolith is fairly stable and offers a firm surface on which to build and operate telescopes without requiring costly and fault - prone stabilizing mechanisms . on the other hand ,",
    "the successful operation of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) has shown that space - based telescopes have fewer problems in the much more easily accessible leo environment .",
    "there is also a possibility of regular servicing , which is harder to do on the moon .",
    "however , the trend of placing astronomical telescopes in the @xmath6 lagrangian point indicates that the issue of servicing is minor , in comparison to the quality of the location .",
    "therefore it was decided that space observatories are more cost - effective than lunar - based observatories . however , the ambitions were always for the large lunar telescopic installations with 4100 m mirrors or total mass of 1030 tons of radio antennas ( e.g. douglas & smith 1985 ; angel et al .",
    "2008 ) , driven possibly by the fact that since we are going to the moon anyway , we can as well make it big .",
    "a uv / optical transit telescope that uses the slow lunar sidereal rate was first proposed by mcgraw ( 1994 ) , with further development by ( nein & hilchey 1995 ) . modest - sized uv / o / ir fully - steerable robotic telescopes using lightweight optics have been also proposed @xcite and it was suggested that a large 20-m liquid mirror telescope ( angel et al .",
    "2008 ) with uv imaging capability has the potential to surpass the sensitivity of hst and even jwst by orders of magnitude ( klimas et al .",
    "however , the first and only astronomical uv observations from the moon to date were made by apollo 16 team in 1972 .",
    "we were recently given an opportunity to fly an astronomical instrument onboard the team indus lunar lander to the moon .",
    "team indus is an indian entry to the google lunar x  prize ( glxp ) competition .",
    "this mission is a soft - landing mission and carries a mini - exploration rover amongst other instruments .",
    "after the touchdown , all scientific instruments will be turned on in a pre - defined sequence with the highest priority being accorded to the team indus rover deployment .",
    "our primary challenge was to come up with an instrument that would do good science within the constraints imposed by the primary mission , one of the major is that we have to deliver the payload by mid-2015 .",
    "we have chosen a wide - field uv telescope  lunar ultraviolet cosmic imager ( luci ) , operating in the far - uv ( fuv ) range of 130180 nm , taking advantage of the transparency of the lunar sky to the uv .",
    "our primary science goals is detection of transients such as , for example , tdes , or sne in distant galaxies as a probe for cosmological distant scale .",
    "sne discovered in optical surveys , are usually caught too late , when the uv emission is already fading .",
    "if we detect sne early , the hot thermal emission from the ejecta is bright in the uv .",
    "as we perform our survey of the sky , we will also pick up other transients such as near - earth asteroids , as well as produce an fuv catalog of the sky .",
    "we will also map the hot stellar distribution in the galactic disk .",
    "the very first instrument to fly to the moon was luna 1 , a soviet lunar impactor which , unfortunately , missed the moon in january 1959 and became a solar orbiter .",
    "it performed the first - ever direct measurements of the solar wind , measured the particle level in the outer radiation belts and found no signature of a lunar magnetic field .",
    "actual scientific exploration of and from the moon began when luna 2 landed on the moon on september 14 , 1959 .",
    "the instruments were similar to those of luna 1 .",
    "luna 2 detected fluctuations in the electron flux and energy spectrum in the van allen radiation belt , finding no evidence of a lunar magnetic field or radiation belt .",
    "further spacecraft in the luna series continued the exploration of the moon with luna 3 taking the first photographs of the far side of the moon on october 7 1959 , showing far fewer signs of volcanic plains than expected which stimulated a revision of lunar evolution theories .",
    "subsequently , luna 9 and 10 measured the radiation fields in near - lunar space and determined that the lunar dusty ground could support a lander .",
    "on august 23 1966 , nasa s lunar orbiter 1 sent back the world s first image of the earth from the vicinity of the moon .",
    "nasa s ranger missions in the early 1960s , in particular ranger 7 , 8 and 9 , transmitted high - resolution images of the lunar surface before crashing into it . following the rangers , the lunar surveyor series ( 1 to 7 ) at the end of that decade soft - landed television cameras and other scientific tools to test the lunar surface prior to human landings in the apollo program . the apollo missions of 19691972 extended the studies of the earth - moon system interactions .    lunar exploration was put on halt in 1976 with the completion of soviet luna program until the hiten flyby and orbiter mission in 1990 @xcite , followed by several missions of different countries , roughly one every four years . however , these missions were all aimed at studying the moon itself and its environment , rather than using the lunar surface as a base for astronomical observations , perhaps because of the success of orbital observatories at a fraction of the cost of a lunar base .",
    "the s201-experiment fuv camera ( 50160 nm ) deployed by the apollo 16 mission is the only uv telescope that operated on the surface of the moon till now ( at time of writing ) .",
    "it had an fov of 20 degrees and a resolution of 24 arcmin ( brosch 2009 ) .",
    "it had low sensitivity and could only see stars brighter than @xmath7 magnitude but still obtained the first fuv atlas of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , as well as of several fields at low and high galactic latitudes .",
    "it also produced the first ever images of the earth in fuv ( fig .",
    "[ fig : appollo ] ) .",
    "several new missions are now planned and some have already been carried out , e.g. the chinese change 3 mission launched in december 2013 , with lander and rover having already survived for several lunar days .",
    "the lander is equipped with a near - uv telescope ( lut ) and @xmath8-wide extreme ultraviolet camera ( euvc ) to study earth s plasmasphere ( cao et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the lander s panoramic cameras and the euvc have returned the first optical and uv images of the earth from the moon s surface in 4 decades . the lunar uv - telescope also completed commissioning operations and is expected to perform science operations throughout the lander s projected one - year mission , looking at bright astronomical objects , including galaxies , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and bright stars .",
    "it is quite possible that very soon a floodgate of lunar missions will open  the unprecedented opportunities for intensive missions for astronomy on / from the moon due to the surge in privately funded space exploration and through the newly - developing partnership between private companies and governments renewed the concept of the moon as the next place to go .",
    "year 2013 witnessed two successful missions , nasa s orbiter laddee to study lunar atmosphere , and a china s change-3 lander  a partnership between china and the international lunar observatory association ( iloa ) .",
    "several glxp competition teams could land on moon in 2015 , and india , russia and usa planned missions before 2020 , with uk , esa and south korea to follow after 2020 .",
    "a report on a market study by a london economics commissioned by the x  prize foundation estimated that commercial opportunities on the moon will be worth billions of dollars in the next few decades @xcite .",
    "one of the private companies , moon express , is planning to perform astronomical observations from the moon , developing an international lunar observatory with a 2-kg optical instrument ( ilo - x ) to fly aboard moon express mission as part of the glxp competition , which will be a precursor to a permanent lunar radio observatory ilo-1 , a 2-m rigid dish antenna , scheduled for 2018 .",
    "it does nt stop at the moon  a new space race seems to have started , a race between governmental agencies and private firms , and it is may be that the firms will lead .",
    "the prospecting of deep - space resources have required till now an expensive technology with funds available only to developed nations governments , but are quickly becoming cheap enough for a private industry or a corporation .",
    "the best example is the google lunar x  prize endeavour .",
    "moreover , a flood of private space - exploratory proposals is coming , and they do provide space for science as well .",
    "take , for example , planetary resources , inc . , a company founded in 2009 by eric c. anderson and peter h. diamandis . the primary business of planetary resources is defined as prospecting and mining asteroids with high concentrations of water and precious metals , but they are also collaborating with nasa in detecting and tracking neos , and readying to launch the arkyd 100 as the first private low - cost space telescope , with follow - up of several more arkyd 200s ( lewicki et al .",
    "deep space industries is preparing a series of low - cost robotic fly - by and rendezvous spacecrafts , based on cubesat technologies , to gather data on small pha - type asteroids ( gump 2013 ) .",
    "they currently contemplate a round - trip craft that will be able to return 25 to 50 kg of samples to near - earth space , or even directly to earth .",
    "not only industries are involved : the nonprofit charitable organization b612 foundation is building an ir imaging space telescope _",
    "sentinel _ to launch in 2018 into a venus - like orbit for neo cataloging , with a proposed mission lifetime of more than 6 years ( lu et al .",
    "we live in exciting times indeed and hope that there will be a market for niche scientific payloads in these missions !",
    "because of the constraints of time and the available platform , we will not have 3-axis pointing freedom for luci .",
    "therefore we have to understand the motion of the lunar sky and how our initial orientation determines which sources we will be able to observe .",
    "the motion of the lunar sky is a result of three major movements : the moon s axial rotation , its revolution around the earth and the moon - earth s system revolution around the sun .",
    "there are additional minor contributors , such as the ellipticity of the lunar orbit around the earth and its variation , inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic , the regression of the lunar nodes with the 18.6 yrs period , precession of apsides ( 8.85 yrs ) , the precession of the lunar rotational axis to the ecliptic with the period of 18.6 yrs , and the motion in space together with the sun , most of which , however , are only important for long - term missions .    [ [ ellipticity ] ] ellipticity + + + + + + + + + + +    the moon s orbit around the earth is slightly elliptical with an average eccentricity of @xmath9 , which in addition varies from 0.04 to 0.07 with a period of 8.9 years .",
    "the main observational result of this is the @xmath10 variation in the size of the earth as seen from the moon , from @xmath11 in aposelene to @xmath12 in periselene .",
    "[ [ tidal - locking ] ] tidal locking + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the moon is tidally locked with the earth , its sidereal day ( 27 1/3 terrestrial days ) is equal to the period of its revolution around the earth .",
    "the axis of rotation is nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane at @xmath13 .",
    "a solar day on the moon is slightly longer than a sidereal day and is equal to the synodic month , 29 1/2 terrestrial days and , since the tilt of the lunar axis to its solar orbit is nearly @xmath14 , the sun traces the same path through the lunar sky all year .",
    "however , due to libration , the earth , as seen from the moon , will continuously shift its position on the lunar sky .",
    "[ [ libration ] ] libration + + + + + + + + +    the sky from the moon experiences libration both in latitude and in longitude which cause celestial sources to shift their coordinate positions on the sky .",
    "librations in longitude are due to the non - uniform motion of the moon along its orbit ; the maximal value reaches @xmath15 .",
    "librations in latitude are due to the @xmath16 tilt of the lunar axis to its orbit around the earth and have a range of @xmath17 .",
    "the main observational result is that the earth traces an approximate oval @xmath18 diameter on the lunar sky in one month .",

    "[ sec : power ] ) , we can only observe during the lunar daytime , which still gives us nearly two weeks of continuous observations , although the sun has to be avoided . in the case of zenith pointing , the sun will be always more than @xmath19 away from the pointing direction . in case",
    "we have the orientation freedom , we will take care to choose pointings that are a minimum of @xmath19 away from the sun . scattering of sunlight from the lunar surface is less of a problem because of the low albedo of the lunar surface in the uv ( at least three times lower than the earth s ) and the solar flux in the fuv spectral range is strongly reduced .",
    "note that our spectral range has been chosen specifically to be solar - blind .    at night on the moon , the temperature of a radiatively cooled structure goes down to 60 k ; we however are not planning to operate at night because there will be no power . during the daytime ,",
    "the subsolar point can reach @xmath20 k , with an average of @xmath21 k. however , thermal stresses in the telescope would be much reduced compared to a space telescope as the sun moves slowly on the lunar sky , and the illumination is more or less uniform across the telescope structure , whereas a space telescope is subject to a large temperature gradient .",
    "the lunar environment is thus strongly favoured if we would be to provide suitable shielding . for discussion on the topic of shielding , see sec .",

    "much less than proposed pixel size ( see table  [ table : overview ] ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain deep exposures during a single transit : a point source will cross a @xmath26 fov in @xmath27 hrs .",
    "since the uv window planned for luci is not reachable on ground based telescopes , it makes luci a unique instrument in this wavelength range .",

    "ritchey - chrtien telescopes are well - suited for wide - field imaging in a compact package ; the overall dimensions of the telescope are @xmath33 cm . with the use of a carbon - fiber structures , a 30-cm primary mirror will weigh around 1.5 kg .",
    "we have designed for a @xmath34 degrees field of view with a pixel size of @xmath35 m , such that we can reach a limiting magnitude of 21 magnitude ( stmag ) in 1000 sec .",
    "the detector is a microchannel plate ( mcp)-based single - photon counting detector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "it consists of a caesium iodide ( csi ) ( optional gallium nitride gan ) photocathode , a chevron stack of 2 mcps and a position sensitive cross - strip ( xs ) anode sealed in a detector body .",
    "mcps are two - dimensional periodic arrays consisting of many small - diameter glass channels ; the channels of 2 mcps are tilted with respect to the surface normal to suppress ion feedback from ionized residual gas .",
    "when a photon hits the cathode , an electron is released and is accelerated towards the mcp stack across a voltage gap of about 200 v. each photoelectron produces secondary electrons by striking the channel walls of the mcps resulting in an avalanche of electrons leaving the mcp stack at the bottom . a unique feature of an mcp electron amplifier is to provide high gains in excess of @xmath36@xmath37 electrons per event while preserving the location within a single pore .",
    "detectors requiring single event - counting capabilities utilize readout methods in which the electron cloud from the mcp is sampled by the anode and the charge information is processed by the front - end electronics ( fee ) to determine the position where the original photon hit the detector and the photon arrival time .",
    "the xs anode technique utilizes two orthogonal direction planes of parallel strips / wires that serve to detect @xmath38 and @xmath39 positions .",
    "the xs anode works by dividing the charge rather than using a signal propagation time - delay , which give the capability of higher spatial resolution and a faster event - processing speed .",
    "the two axes layers ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 strips ) collect an equal amount of charge from the mcp .",
    "the electron cloud from the mcp is collected on several strips ( approximately five ) on each axis which allows an accurate determination of the centroid of the event .",
    "each strip of the anode is connected to an amplifier and then to an analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) , outside the vacuum , to read out the charge on individual strips .",
    "an advantage of an xs anode technique is good spatial resolution ( @xmath40 m fwhm ) with a smaller mcp signal ; it only requires two mcps to achieve efficient gain ( @xmath41 electrons ) .",

    "the lander will be equipped with inclinometers to determine its pitch and roll angles .",
    "in addition to six sun sensors that will provide the location of the sun , we will use luci to determine the offset of the lander s zenith from the ` true ' zenith by beginning observations at the pitch angle of @xmath60 .",
    "the lander will have a precise on - board time clock and moon orbital information , which together with the positions of the sun and the earth ( determined by the earth antenna ) will provide the value of the yaw angle , i.e. the luci azimuthal pointing .",
    "the programmed luci pointing is @xmath61 at programmed landing site of @xmath62 , @xmath63w . in case of missing the programmed localization",
    ", we will update the observational plan by uplink from the earth .",
    "the primary photometric calibration of luci will be made with reference to a set of well - studied hot , young and/or massive stars , including bright @xmath64 , @xmath65 and hot white dwarfs ( wds ) as was done for the uv instruments onboard the hst .",
    "these stars are photometrically stable , their fluxes are well matched to the sensitivities of modern space instrumentation and their spectral energy distributions ( sed ) are well characterized .",
    "the fuv fluxes of these stars are presently known to better than @xmath5 .",
    "the standards will be observed as they transit across the luci fov .",
    "for the definition of luci photometric system , we will use the ab magnitude system that is widely used in uv astronomy ( oke & gunn 1983 ) m_luci=-2.5 -48.6 , where @xmath66 is averaged monochromatic flux ( in ergs / sec / cm@xmath47/hz ) at the effective wavelength ( averaged across the bandpass ) , |f _ = , where @xmath68 is the total system s response , @xmath69 is the sed of a source , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the lower and upper wavelength limits of luci s bandpass .",
    "however , since luci is a photon counting device , the real units of luci are photon counts per sec , that can be converted accordingly to flux units or magnitudes using = f(^2/ ) a_eff , where @xmath72 is source flux and @xmath73 is the total effective area in cm@xmath47  the product of the mirror geometric collecting area ( @xmath74 ) , detector quantum efficiency ( q.e . ) , and the optics efficiency which includes reflectivity of mirrors , absorption by the correcting lenses and absorption by the metering structures ( ` spiders ' ) holding the secondary mirrors , a_eff = a_coll .",

    "we have identified several science areas where the imaging far - uv observations from the moon can deliver unique scientific results . however , it should be noted that , in many ways , this is a pioneering experiment , part of a new way of doing astronomy .",
    "the cost of going to space is decreasing rapidly and there may be many opportunities for serendipitous science ; perhaps as suitcases on flights of virgin galactic or as nano - satellites based on the cubesat format ( brosch , balabanov & behar 2014 ) .",
    "this particular opportunity takes advantage of the team indus effort to send a rover to the moon .",
    "we have carefully selected a set of science objectives and instrumentation suited for this first opportunity . however , as more and more such flights occur , we expect that astronomers ( and other scientists ) will be able to take advantage of a diverse set of missions to perform unique science .",
    "a very important advantage of a lunar fuv telescope with a wavelength range limited to 135180 nm and the use of a csi cathode is the absence of several noise contributors which are intrinsic to telescopes at longer spectral regions in leo :    1 .   zodiacal light  sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust contributes significantly at wavelengths longward of 200 nm , where the solar flux rises rapidly and practically negligible in the fuv range .",
    "airglow  line emission from the earth s upper atmosphere bright throughout the uv range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : appollo ] ) and is an important background contributor for leo missions ( murthy 2014 ) .",
    "3 .   instrument background  the dark count in uv instruments due to fast particles hitting the mcp .",
    "though typically low , it varies throughout the orbit for leo spacecrafts , rising in areas of high particle count , such as the south atlantic anomaly or the polar regions . on the moon ,",
    "galactic cosmic rays and solar wind particles are the main sources of radiation . their flux , however , is about half of that in deep space due to self - blocking by the moon ( adams et al .",
    "4 .   spacecraft jitter  a lunar platform is very stable , thus one more advantage in comparison with the space - based telescope .",
    "when discussing astronomy in the fuv domain , one has to consider first what are the sources expected to emit significant amount of radiation in this spectral region . in general , sources will produce either continuum radiation or discrete emission lines .",
    "the continuum can either be from a black - body ( bb ) or almost a black - body ( such as a star or a population of stars ) , or from a non - thermal source ( nts ) , such as synchrotron emission from electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "a bb is characterized by its effective temperature . in order to produce a significant flux in the luci bandpass",
    ", a stellar source has to be 34 times hotter than the sun , 18000 to 24000@xmath99k , corresponding to early-@xmath65 or @xmath64-type stars .",
    "note also that late-@xmath65 and even @xmath100-type stars or hotter may be detected , provided they are relatively nearby .",
    "stellar radiation may be `` blue - shifted '' and become more uv - dominated if it is scattered by small dust particles .",
    "this is the inverse of interstellar reddening and can be seen in the vicinity of hot stars that are associated with dust as reflection nebulae .",
    "a good example of a reflection nebula is ngc 1435 near 23 tau , the merope star in the pleiades , with its brightest knot ic 349 ( herbig 1996 ; herbig & simon 2001 ) .    just like single stars",
    ", entire galaxies can significantly contribute to the fuv continuum radiation , provided their stellar population contains large numbers of @xmath64 and early-@xmath65 stars .",
    "since these stars are massive , 10 m@xmath101 or more , they are also short - lived .",
    "the fuv is , therefore , a good indicator of very recent star formation . by `` counting '' the fuv photons one can",
    ", therefore , account for the massive and short - lived stars in an extended source , revealing a very recent star formation burst .",
    "extended extragalactic fuv sources are often produced from the interaction of galaxies with the intra - cluster medium in clusters of galaxies .",
    "examples of such phenomena are in the virgo cluster ( ngc 4330 ; abramson et al .",
    "2011 ) , and in the coma cluster ( smith et al . 2010 ) .",
    "however , in some cases extended emission is produced by star formation away from the main body of a galaxy .",
    "examples for this are the uv filaments detected near brightest cluster galaxies ( oonk et al .",
    "2011 ) and the extended uv disks of some galaxies ( e.g. thilker et al .",
    "2007 ) .    in the solar system ,",
    "the expected fuv sources are the lyman @xmath54 halos around planets produced by resonant scattering of the solar radiation , which however are outside the proposed luci band , and aurorae and airglow in the atmospheres of planets and major satellites .",
    "a few fuv observations of comets were made by galex ( e.g. morgenthaler et al . 2011 ) , where the emission is dominated by the ci emission bands excited by the solar radiation and wind .      as shown in sec .",
    "3 , a stationary telescope on the moon scans the sky and over a period of one lunar day approximately 44 deg@xmath47 of the sky can be observed .",
    "the baseline operation is with the zenithal orientation of luci ( the ecliptic is always at @xmath102 from zenith ) , however , we will be able to change the pitch angle between @xmath103 ( horizon ) and @xmath104 ( zenith ) degrees .",
    "observations will be performed using the altitude / azimuth ( alt / az ) coordinate system .",
    "the celestial coordinates of the object will be converted to the attitude of the telescope pointing , i.e. the azimuth and the altitude angle of an object on the lunar sky . at low altitudes ,",
    "star motions are no longer tangential and thus the tracks have a small curvature . to avoid this problem we will be pointing the telescope at a typical altitude angle of more than @xmath105 .",
    "pointing above this angle also removes the problem of the lunar  horizon glow \" - a reported scattering of sunlight by lunar dust  atmosphere \" ( murphy & vondrak 1993 ) .",
    "the proposed landing site is at mare imbrium / sinus iridum at selenographic coordinates @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the accuracy of the landing is about 100 km .",
    "we have generated maps of the lunar sky for the months of october 2015  december 2015 using the _ stellarium _ software . in case",
    "the lander can orient before the actual landing to a pre - determined direction , we select the azimuthal angle of @xmath108 . at this orientation ,",
    "the earth crosses the @xmath109 azimuth line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] , _ top right _ ) and we will be able to observe it .",
    "earth is bright in the fuv , in particular , the geocorona extends to @xmath110 km emitting large amount of lyman-@xmath54 photons at 121.7 nm .",
    "it would be very interesting part to observe the earth at different phases at small illumination ( in the lunar day the earth is never in the full phase ) in the uv range outside the lyman- contribution .",
    "since the worst case scenario is that luci would not survive the first lunar night , we plan to observe important targets in the first month : calibration objects , galactic plane , earth  we provide detailed maps of the first months as online source and maps for the first few days in figure  [ fig : maps ] .",
    "for example , on 02/10/2015 earth is at az / alt : @xmath111 at @xmath112 illumination .",
    "on 03/10/2015 at 13:00 hrs , the galactic centre is at az / alt : @xmath113 and earth is at az / alt:@xmath114 at @xmath115 illumination . on 04/10/2015 at 02:00 hrs , the intersection of the galactic plane with the ecliptic crossing the @xmath109 azimuth at @xmath116 elevation .",

    "scattered light due to dust clouds on the moon can play the role of a sky background but the choice of the fuv range removes this problem .",
    "we have simulated the far - uv background with luci s parameters using the uv sky background simulator astus ( safonova et al .",
    "2012 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : astus_simulations ] , we display the results of all - sky simulation for the month of october 2015 in a projected bandwidth of luci assuming a flat step filter profile for two separate components of the background : stars and diffuse galactic light ( top and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "the thick solid line marks the local horizon ; only the sky above the line is observable in october .",
    "for example , we can observe the galactic plane , but not the magellanic clouds .",
    "we have also calculated the count levels ( diffuse galactic + stars ) for a few open clusters that can be used for astrometric calibration .",
    "astrometric calibration includes pointing accuracy estimation , fov calibration , distortion correction , etc .",
    "for these purposes , extended fields containing many stars with good astrometry , such as open clusters , are generally used .",
    "zodiacal light is usually nearly negligible in fuv , therefore we did not consider it in these simulations .",
    "the background levels produced by diffuse light and stars in the fields of possible calibration targets in counts / s over the full fov are given in table  [ table : astrometry ] .",
    "astus uses hipparcos catalog for modelling of stars , which however , does not contain white dwarfs .            in this paper",
    "we have shown that in spite of being a small and experimental instrument , luci is a viable preliminary design for a lunar uv telescope that would be able to provide some unique scientific results .",

    "<S> space astronomy in the last 40 years has largely been done from spacecraft in low earth orbit ( leo ) for which the technology is proven and delivery mechanisms are readily available . </S>",
    "<S> however , new opportunities are arising with the surge in commercial aerospace missions . </S>",
    "<S> we describe here one such possibility : deploying a small instrument on the moon . </S>",
    "<S> this can be accomplished by flying onboard the indian entry to the google lunar x  prize competition , team indus mission , which is expected to deliver a nearly 30 kgs of payloads to the moon , with a rover as its primary payload . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to mount a wide - field far - uv ( 130180 nm ) imaging telescope as a payload on the team indus lander . </S>",
    "<S> our baseline operation is a fixed zenith pointing but with the option of a mechanism to allow observations of different attitudes . pointing towards intermediate ecliptic latitude ( @xmath0 or above ) </S>",
    "<S> ensures that the sun is at least @xmath1 off the line of sight at all times . in this position , </S>",
    "<S> the telescope can cover higher galactic latitudes as well as parts of galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> the scientific objectives of such a prospective are delineated and discussed .    </S>",
