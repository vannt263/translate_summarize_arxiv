    "we discuss the sample selection and evaluation of the stellar disk s structural parameters , consider reliability of the parameters , and study the radial variation of the disk scaleheight . in sections 3 and 4 we show how the comparison of the parameters obtained in the three nir bands can be used to estimate the extinction - corrected scaleheight in the galactic disks .",

    "we apply the technique described by @xcite to obtain the structural parameters of stellar disks of the galaxies disks .",
    "this method is based on the analysis of photometric profiles drawn parallel to the major and minor axes of galaxy at a one - pixel interval .",
    "the volume brightness in the stellar disks is assumed to change in the radial @xmath8 or vertical @xmath9 directions as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the scalelength and scaleheight of the disk , respectively , and @xmath11 is the central surface luminosity of the face - on disk , which corresponds to the central surface brightness @xmath3 . the model photometric profiles are obtained by the integration of equation ( [ vol_disk ] ) along the line - of - sight and then by convolution with the instrumental profile .",
    "the best - fit parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath12 are estimated for each radial or vertical profile , and then their median values are taken as the resulting scales and central surface brightness of the stellar disks , whereas the standard deviations of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath12 estimated from different profiles are taken as uncertainty of the parameters .",
    "the central regions of the galaxies in which bulges may exist are excluded from our analysis .",

    "figure  1 shows histograms of distribution of the scale heights ( top panel ) and scale lengths ( bottom panel ) estimated for our program galaxies . in both panels , the j- and h - band scales are normalized by those in the k@xmath0 band . it can be noticed that the scaleheights look systematically larger , on average , in the j band than those in the k@xmath0 for the same galaxy .",
    "we will discuss this effect below : in   [ three_band ] using our observational data , and in ",
    "[ im_sim ] with the help of artificial data .      as in @xcite",
    ", we investigate how the scaleheight @xmath2 of the stellar disks in our galaxies change with the distance to the center @xmath8 .",
    "our approach to the estimation of the @xmath2 is independent of the apriori assumptions about behavior of the scaleheight with radius , in a contrast with 3-d modeling of the radiation transfer in the stellar and dust disks . since we analyze the vertical profiles separately from each other , this approach is insensitive to possible bending of the galactic disks .",
    "note that if the resulting scaleheight @xmath14 demonstrates a systematic growth with distance to the center , it suggests that the real radial gradient of the disk scaleheight may be a few times greater due to the projection effects .",
    "we fit @xmath14 with a linear function of radius @xmath8 and find the radial gradients of @xmath2 ( expressed in units of @xmath2 ) per scalelength , see figure  2 .",
    "different lines in figure  2 show histograms of distribution of the gradient in the j , h , and k@xmath0 bands in our whole sample .",
    "the median gradient @xmath15 in the @xmath13 is essentially zero ( -0.01 ) , as well as in the h ( 0 . ) and j ( 0.01 ) bands .",
    "note that some galaxies in histogram in figure  2 indeed show noticeable radial gradients of the scaleheight . in combination with projection effects",
    ", it suggests significant gradients @xmath15 in a small fraction of our galaxies .      the dust disks embedded into the stellar components of the galaxies may significantly distort the structural parameters of the stellar disks estimated even from the nir images .",
    "we check reliability of the estimated parameters via the following simulations .",
    "a set of artificial images is created using equation ( [ vol_disk ] ) and typical parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the surface brightness @xmath3 is replaced by the luminosity surface density @xmath12 in our simulations .",
    "each stellar disk contains an embedded dust disk inside with scalelength of 1.5@xmath1 and scaleheight of 1/3 @xmath2 ( according to * ? ? ?",
    ". the face - on opacity of the dust disk corresponds to @xmath16 = 1 mag .",
    "this value should be close to the upper limit for the face - on extinction in spiral galaxies @xcite , finally , the model disks are randomly inclined by 85 - 90 degrees and their images ( i.e. 2-d projections to the plane of sky ) are obtained via integration along the line - of - sight .",
    "the images are then convolved with the instrumental profile typical for the observations .",
    "then the poisson and gaussian noise patterns are added to create sets of typically thirty artificial images with the same parameters but with different random noise pattern .",
    "the images are analyzed by the same way as the real galaxies ; the mean values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath12 and their r.m.s . are estimated and then compared with the input parameters .",
    "figures  3 and 4 give examples how well the structural parameters can be extracted from the artificial edge - on disks made with stars and dust should they be observed in the j and k@xmath0 nir bands .",
    "although the scalelength and the central surface brightness can be recovered with a fairly good accuracy from both j and k@xmath0 bands , the scaleheight in the j band looks systematically thicker due to the dust absorption effects only .",
    "the k@xmath0 scaleheight in this case is found to be about 15% greater than the model input scaleheight .",
    "we check how the chosen values of the model parameters affect our conclusions .",
    "the amount of the dust opacity is responsible for increasing the estimated scale height and makes it thicker by 10 - 15% in the k@xmath0 if @xmath16 is of the order of 1 mag .",
    "much higher values of the central dust opacity , more than 3 mag , make stellar disks look about twice as thick even in the k@xmath0 band . at the same time",
    ", the disk scalelength shows relatively small variations in this case .",
    "variations of the dust scalelength between @xmath1 and 2@xmath1 do not change the estimated structural parameters significantly .",
    "the dust disk thickness affect the estimated stellar disk thickness in the most power when it is about a half of @xmath2 .",
    "once the dust disk is getting comparable in thickness with the stellar one , it affects mostly the stellar disk surface brightness , and not @xmath2 .    the inclination of the stellar disk to the line - of - sight is an important parameter and it increases the stellar disk thickness estimated in our modeling by more than 15% , if the inclination is getting to be greater than 5 degrees . on the other hand ,",
    "the relatively small inclination has almost no effect on the recovered stellar disk scalelength and central surface brightness .",
    "more than 5 degrees inclination in galactic disks would create problem with estimation of @xmath2 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but such galaxies should fail the rfgc catalog criteria and we do nt expect to have many of highly inclined disks in our sample . if the size of the modeling disk is so small that its true scaleheight is much less than the seeing , the resulting @xmath2 gets independent of the original disk scaleheight .",
    "our selection of objects for the analysis by size of their major axis prevents such situation .",
    "given all other parameters fixed , the recovering scalelength , scaleheight , and surface brightness are independent of the numerical value of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath12 unless @xmath2 is getting smaller than a pixel in the model images .",
    "in general , our modeling suggests that we can estimate the structural parameters with of order of ten percent precision using our method . at the same time , the sensitivity to the variations of the scaleheight within the same galaxy with different amount of extinction ( like in the case of observations in different nir bands ) should be by the order of magnitude better .",
    "as we can see from our observational results shown in figure  1 , the stellar disks look thicker in the j band and thinner in k@xmath0 for the same object , in agreement with our modeling from ",
    "[ im_sim ] .",
    "two factors may be responsible for such a difference in real galaxies : the vertical gradient of stellar population properties and the dust attenuation .",
    "let s consider the effects of the radial and vertical gradients of stellar population in galactic disks .",
    "the radial gradients of metallicity in the thin disks are of the order of -0.07 dex / kpc for the late - type galaxies @xcite , and even less in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "according to the population synthesis models by @xcite , this creates gradients in ( j - k@xmath0 ) color of the order of -0.015 mag / kpc ( i.e. the periphery is bluer ) .",
    "hence , the scalelength in j should appear 4 % longer than that in k for a typical scalelength values of 3 kpc .",
    "a radial age gradient in combination with the metallicity change may rise this scalelength change to 5% . as we see , these numbers are within our accuracy of estimation of the scalelength .",
    "the vertical gradients of metallicity and age , and hence contribution of the stellar population effects to the vertical color variations within the thin stellar disk , are usually small @xcite .",
    "even if we assume the large values for the vertical gradient of [ fe / h ] as in @xcite , -0.2 dex / kpc , this would create less than 1% longer scaleheights in the j than that in the k@xmath0 due to the stellar population gradients .",
    "the amplitude of the changes of scalelengths and scaleheights between the h and k@xmath0 bands is roughly a half of that between the j and k@xmath0 .",
    "we conclude that the scaleheights of the pure thin stellar disk ( i.e. without dust ) estimated from the j , h , and k@xmath0 images should appear the same .",
    "all significant scaleheight variations have to be addressed to the reddening effects .",
    "this is in agreement with conclusions by @xcite .",
    "note that in some cases of extraordinary objects like a superthin galaxy ugc  7321 @xcite , the reddening alone can not explain the observed optical color ( b - r ) , ( r - h ) variations in the vertical direction and vertical gradients of metallicity and age are required for the stellar population . at the same time , @xcite note that the superthin s h - k color gradients might be explained by the wavelength - dependent dust absorption alone .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a vertical luminosity profile of an edge - on image of a stellar disk with the volume brightness @xmath17 .",
    "embedded co - planar dust disk with its scaleheight @xmath18 absorbs and scatters the stellar light in dependence of the dust extinction coefficient @xmath19 . for simplicity , we neglect the dust scatter appealing to @xcite conclusion that the structural parameters of stellar disks in 3-d modeling of the light distribution with or without scattering are not significantly different . as in @xcite ,",
    "the brightness distribution along the minor photometric axis ( z ) in such a disk is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the brightness profile in the case of zero extinction , and @xmath22 is the optical depth across the whole edge - on disk , which also depends on the vertical distance over the galactic plane @xmath9 . for small @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the observed scaleheight @xmath24 of the stellar disk with added extinction is connected with its projected brightness along the selected profile as @xmath25 .",
    "given @xmath26 , we find that @xmath27 . therefore , estimating the thickness of the stellar disk with dust from its edge - on profiles we expect to find @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath24 estimated from the disk s brightness profile at a certain photometric band , and the optical depth in the plane of the disk in certain photometric band is @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 equals to 0.276 , 0.176 , and 0.112 in the j , h , and k@xmath0 bands , respectively @xcite . since the v - band optical depth @xmath32 and @xmath33 are fixed for the same disk , we use linear regression and fit a line to three data points ( for j , h , and k@xmath0 values ) at @xmath31 - @xmath29 diagram to find @xmath33 .    for the convenience of comparison of the vertical scales ,",
    "we normalize the j and h scaleheights in each galaxy by their k@xmath0-band scaleheight .",
    "the upper panel in figure  5 compares the normalized scaleheights .",
    "each line in the panel connects three thicknesses for one galaxy .",
    "the tendency to observe the stellar disks thicker in the j than in the k@xmath0 is well seen .",
    "the histogram in the lower panel in figure  5 shows the distributions of all normalized @xmath2 in three nir colors .",
    "the vertical thick line designates all scaleheights in the @xmath13 because of the normalization .",
    "the mean ratio of @xmath2 in the j and h to that in k@xmath0 is 1.16 and 1.08 , respectively .",
    "we calculate the scaleheight @xmath33 corrected for the extinction ( or extinction - free hereafter ) using equation ( [ z_e ] ) , which gives @xmath34 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath33 normalized by the @xmath2(k@xmath0 ) is also shown in the lower panel in figure  5 .",
    "the median @xmath33/@xmath2(k@xmath0 ) is about 0.89 , i.e. the thin stellar disks in our galaxies are 11% thinner than it can be estimated from the analysis of the vertical profiles from the k@xmath0-band images . the extinction - free scaleheights are given in table  1 .",
    "we observe no systematic variations in the scalelength between the nir bands , as it can be seen in figure  6 , which is the same as figure  5 but drawn for the scalelengths .",
    "this is not a surprise because our simulations shown in figures  3 and 4 suggest rather small systematic variations of the radial scalelength among the nir bands , and proximity of the @xmath1 estimated from the j , h , and k@xmath0 bands to its extinction - corrected value . using the scalelength @xmath1 from the k@xmath0 band and extinction corrected scaleheights",
    "we find that the mean radial - to - vertical scale ratio in the thin extinction - free stellar disks of galaxies in our sample is 5.6 .",
    "the thickness of the stellar disk is sensitive to the gravitational potential of the disk + bulge + halo system in the vertical direction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the relative thickness of the stellar disk @xmath4 may provide some information about the spherical - to - disk mass ratio . as a first step",
    ", we consider a very simplified model of a galaxy that consists of a stellar exponential disk embedded into a spherical dark halo .",

    ", we find @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , @xmath50    numerical n - body simulations @xcite in which the spherical subsystem was introduced as a fixed potential confirm the equation ( [ zh ] ) .",
    "figure  7 is adopted from @xcite with additions from later simulations by khoperskov ( private communication ) .",

    "both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are determined within the limits of the stellar disk ( four scalelengths in the simulations ) .",
    "circles in figure  7 correspond to different numerical models with various parameters of the disk and dark halo subsystems , as well as with different bulges .",
    "the upper curve corresponds to the bulgeless models , whereas the lower one is for the models with some bulge contribution .",
    "contemporary and more realistic n - body simulations include `` live '' halos that respond to the gravitational potential of disks .",
    "the relation @xmath4 versus @xmath53 should look very similar in those simulations as in figure  7 for the galaxies in which the spherical subsystems dominate by mass ( i.e. for large @xmath54 ) . for the spherical subsystems with masses @xmath55 , figure  7 illustrates an extreme case , and its top left part ( large @xmath4 and small @xmath54 ) demonstrates the lower limit for mass of the spherical subsystem given disk thickness @xmath4 .",
    "preliminary results from n - body simulations ( khoperskov , private communication ) with live halo suggest not essential corrections to @xmath54 inferred from @xmath4 according to figure  7 ( of the order of 15% ) .",
    "we encourage reader to assume our further estimations of halo - to - disk mass ratio made from the disk thickness as lower limits for the real @xmath54 .",
    "following figure  7 , we calculate the distribution of the dark halo mass @xmath56 expressed in the units of the stellar disk mass for our galaxies .",
    "the rfgc members are `` flat '' galaxies that are not expected to harbor large bulges , so we assume here that @xmath57 . we find the following relation for bulgeless galaxies from figure  7 : @xmath58 . according to this formula , the median value of @xmath59 is about 1.3 within our sample .",
    "the histogram of distribution of @xmath59 is shown in figure  8 .",

    "is found , although this relation shows large uncertainty .",
    "following the same basic assumptions , we can include the central surface density @xmath35 into consideration . as it follows from our definition of the disk and total galaxy mass , @xmath60 .",
    "we perform a linear fit between @xmath61 and @xmath62 for our galaxies with known @xmath38 and found that @xmath63 .",
    "it seems more correct to utilize non edge - on galaxies to study such a correlation , and @xcite and @xcite suggest @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , for arbitrary inclined disks .",

    "the very big scatter of points in figure  9 can be attributed to the relatively low accuracy in the @xmath3 , @xmath1 , and @xmath33 , and even more uncertainty is due to the non - constant value of the mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) .",
    "the scatter of this relation can be lowered dramatically if only large ( @xmath73 kpc ) galaxies with the scaleheight gradient in the @xmath13 @xmath74 are considered , see figure  10 . in this case",

    "we avoid central parts of galaxies , and using the rfgc objects prevents us from considering bulge - dominated stellar systems .",
    "the weakness of the simplified assumptions in the modeling described above encourages us to apply a more realistic simulations of the stellar disk vertical structure .",
