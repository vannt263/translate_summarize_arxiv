    "based on the long history of physics of the atomic nucleus as a finite quantum many - body system bound by the strong interaction , nowadays , on the one hand interactions between two , or among three or more , nucleons can be related to quantum chromodynamics and the interaction thus obtained can be used as an input to large - scale shell - model calculations . on the other hand , from the mean - field picture , density - functional theories that describe ground states of nuclides of wide range in the nuclear chart are developing . for a class of excited states ,",
    "the generator - coordinate method is used .",
    "applications of such a framework to light odd-@xmath1 nuclei are just begun  @xcite .    aside from these progresses , traditional effective models are still indispensable to describe detailed properties of collective excitations . in finite many - body systems , individual particle motions and collective motions are of similar energy scales hence couple to each other .",
    "in addition , they are sensitive to the numbers of constituents or the shell filling .",
    "collective vibrations are not necessarily harmonic oscillations and whether multiple excitations exist or not is not trivial .",
    "one of the typical collective motions in medium - heavy nuclei is the @xmath0 vibration .",
    "but its double excitation has been known in a limited number of nuclides such as @xmath4er  @xcite , @xmath5er  @xcite , @xmath6dy  @xcite , @xmath7th  @xcite , @xmath8mo  @xcite , @xmath9mo  @xcite , and @xmath10nd  @xcite in even - even nuclei . among them , @xmath4er , firstly observed one , was studied in terms of various theoretical approaches as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in odd-@xmath1 nuclei , the first observation of the two - phonon @xmath0 vibration was made in @xmath2mo  @xcite , on which any theoretical studies has not been reported to the author s knowledge , and to which the present study is devoted .",
    "then similar excitations were observed in @xmath3nb  @xcite and @xmath11tc  @xcite . the first realistic calculation on @xmath3nb  @xcite was performed in terms of the triaxial projected shell model .",
    "after that the present author made a calculation on this nuclide in terms of the particle - vibration coupling model in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "quite recently , two - phonon states very similar to those in @xmath3nb were observed in @xmath2nb  @xcite . in these isotopes ,",
    "candidates of three - phonon states that fed two - phonon bands strongly were also indicated .",
    "if their property is confirmed , they are the first three - phonon excitation in deformed nuclei , and may indicate that there is a mechanism that makes odd-@xmath1 nuclei more favorable for realizing three - phonon @xmath0 vibrations than even - even nuclei , although spectra of odd-@xmath1 nuclei are thought to be more complex than those of even - even nuclei in general . the present author studied in ref .",

    ". then states at finite rotation still can be approximately classified in terms of @xmath15 , the projection of the angular momentum to the @xmath16 axis .",
    "in contrast , the odd particle in @xmath2mo is in the @xmath17\\,5/2 ^ -$ ] orbital originating from the @xmath18 subshell on which coriolis effects are stronger .",

    "the one - dimensionally cranked nilsson plus bcs one - body hamiltonian is diagonalized , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the standard nilsson plus bcs hamiltonian .",
    "this gives a set of quasiparticle ( qp ) states .",
    "second , i apply the rpa to the residual two - body pairing plus doubly - stretched quadrupole - quadrupole interaction between qps , @xmath22 this gives many rpa modes .",
    "cranking and rpa calculations are done in the five major shells , @xmath23  6 for the neutron and 1  5 for the proton . among rpa modes , i choose the @xmath0-vibrational phonons , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with signature @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , which have outstandingly large @xmath28 transition amplitudes .",
    "regarding them as elementary excitations , i diagonalize the pvc hamiltonian , @xmath29 these calculations are performed in terms of signature - classified bases , and all the resulting quantities are given as continuous functions of the rotational frequency @xmath30 .",
