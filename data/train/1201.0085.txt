    "the discovery of superconductivity in iron - based compounds in 2008 by hosono and collaborators@xcite with a superconducting critical temperature up to @xmath356 k@xcite ushered in a second class of  high temperature superconductors \" after the discovery of the first class of high temperature superconductors in copper - oxide compounds ( cuprates ) in 1986@xcite .",
    "so far , four main families of fe - based superconductors have been found , denoted as ",
    "1111\"-type refeaso(re = rare earth)(feas1111)@xcite , ",
    "122\"-type bfe@xmath2as@xmath2(b = ba , sr , or ca)(feas122)@xcite ,  111\"-type afeas(a = alkali metal)(feas111)@xcite , and  11\"-type tetragonal @xmath4-fese(te)(fech11)@xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare and contrast the fe - based superconductors to the copper - oxide superconductors in order to pinpoint some essential ingredients in realizing high temperature superconductivity@xcite .",
    "there are similarities between the fe - based superconductors and cuprate superconductors : ( 1 ) .",
    "structurally speaking , both the fe - based compounds and cuprates have layered structures .",
    "the fe - based compounds consist of a common fepn(pn = as or se ) layers which are considered to be essential for the occurrence of superconductivity , similar to the cuo@xmath2 planes in cuprates .",
    "superconductivity in the fe - based compounds is realized in a vicinity of antiferromagnetic state , a case that is similar to that in the cuprates .",
    "there are also some significant differences between the fe - based and copper - based superconductors : ( 1 ) .",
    "usually the perfectness of cuo@xmath2 plane is critical in sustaining superconductivity in cuprate superconductors .",
    "but the feas(se ) layers appear to be more tolerant to modifications of external perturbations .",
    "in fact , substitution of fe by other ions like co or ni can even transform a non - superconductor into a superconductor@xcite .",
    "it is known that the parent compounds of cuprate superconductors are insulating mott insulators@xcite , but most parent compounds of the fe - based superconductors are bad metals .",
    "( 3 ) . in the cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the electronic structures are mainly dictated by a single cu 3d@xmath5 band .",
    "but in the fe - based compounds , all the five fe 3d orbitals contribute to the formation of low - lying electronic states , thus forming a typical multi - band system .",
    "the fe - based superconductors discovered so far possess some common characteristics of electronic structure@xcite .",
    "the low - lying electronic excitations are mainly dominated by five 3d orbitals which give rise to a couple of hole - like bands near the zone center @xmath6 and electron - like bands near the zone corner _",
    "m_. since the parent compound of the fe - based superconductors is a bad metal , the electron correlation is believed to be not as strong as that in cuprates .",
    "it remains under debate whether electrons in the fe - based superconductors should be treated locally or itenerantly@xcite .",
    "moreover , while it is well - established that in the cuprate superconductors , the superconducting order parameter has predominantly d - wave symmetry , the pairing symmetry in the fe - based superconductors remains unclear .",
    "it has been proposed that the interband scattering between the hole - like bands near @xmath6 and the electron - like bands near _ m _ gives rise to electron pairing and superconductivity@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "another approach based on strong coupling suggested that the parent compound antiferromagnetism could be understood with frustrated heisenberg model and the local spin coupling could give rise to superconductivity@xcite .",
    "both of these two approaches give an s@xmath7 pairing symmetry ( nodeless gap with sign change between hole and electron fermi surface sheets ) .",
    "in addition , the orbital degree of freedom has also been proposed@xcite to play an important role in this multiband system . enhanced by electron - phonon coupling , orbital order",
    "is considered to be the driving force of antiferromagnetic transition and its fluctuation could lead to superconductivity with s++ pairing symmetry ( no gap sign change between two kinds of fermi surface sheets ) .",
    "although nodeless superconducting gap was revealed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite and gap sign change implied by some experimental techniques@xcite , at this stage it remains to be investigated which of these candidates provide the best description of the fe - based compounds .",
    "very recently , a new superconductor a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , cs , rb , tl and etc . ) with t@xmath9 around 30 k was reported@xcite .",
    "this new superconductor triggered a new wave of excitement in the superconductivity community because it exhibits a couple of unique characteristics@xcite .",
    "first , while the parent compounds of other fe - based superconductors are bad metals , it is suggested that the parent compound of this superconductor could be an insulator@xcite .",
    "second , while the fe - sites in feas(se ) layers of other fe - based superconductors are filled , there could be fe vacancies in this new superconductors@xcite",
    ". the superconductor may show unique magnetic structure with high magnetic transition temperature and large magnetic moment on the fe site@xcite .",
    "particularly , the electronic structure of the new superconductor is distinct from other fe - based superconductors in that no hole - like fermi surface around @xmath6 is present@xcite .",
    "these characteristics will provide new perspectives on understanding the fe - based superconductors . on the other hand , many issues remain unclear at this moment that need further experimental and theoretical efforts@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a brief review on the current status of research on the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors , with an emphasis on their unique electron structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , structural properties including fe vacancy order and several proposed phase diagrams are first discussed .",
    "then we summarize magnetic structures of several reported phases and their spin dynamics . in section 3 , electronic properties , including band structure and fermi surface , gap structures and pairing symmetry are discussed . in section 4 , we provide a summary and discussions on the future issues .",
    "the superconductivity with a t@xmath9 at @xmath330 k was first reported in a compound with a nominal chemical formula k@xmath0fe@xmath2se@xmath2 , which was considered to be isostructural to feas122 , as shown in fig.1@xcite . later on fang _",
    "et al_. @xcite pointed out that fe deficiency exists in ( tl@xmath10k@xmath11)fe@xmath0se@xmath2 compounds , as those discovered previously in the tlfe@xmath0ch@xmath2 ( ch = s , se ) compounds@xcite . by tuning the fe content @xmath12 , different phases from an insulator to a superconductor",
    "can be obtained ( fig.2a and fig.2b ) . at low fe content @xmath12 ,",
    "the compound is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a high n@xmath13el temperature . with increasing @xmath12 ,",
    "the antiferromagnetism is gradually suppressed and superconductivity emerges around @xmath14 with only a small fraction of superconducting volume .",
    "bulk superconductivity can be found when @xmath15 .",
    "similar insulator - to - superconductor transition is also reported in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 by varying the potassium content , @xmath12@xcite .",
    "a sign of possible t@xmath9 at 40 k was reported in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , ( tl , k ) ) system@xcite but it remains hard to isolate a pure superconducting phase .",
    "t@xmath9 of the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , ( tl , rb ) ) superconductor decreases from 31 k to zero with increasing pressure and then another phase with a t@xmath9 as high as 48 k was reported under higher pressure@xcite .",
    "it is apparent that the physical properties of a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 rely on both the content of a ( @xmath12 ) and the content of fe ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is therefore essential to have a precise determination of the sample composition in order to build a clear correspondence between the composition , structure and physical properties .",
    "a phase diagram was constructed in rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 based on composition determination and corresponding magnetic , conductivity and specific heat measurements@xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.2c , superconductivity was discovered with an fe content between 1.53 and 1.6 , while insulating and semiconducting behaviors were observed with fe contents at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . another phase diagram based on the fe valence state ( @xmath19 ) was proposed in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2@xcite which is divided into three regions ( fig .",
    "these regions show structural and afm transitions at similar temperatures .",
    "but superconductivity appears only in region ii with @xmath20 and t@xmath9 is nearly independent of @xmath19 .",
    "afm insulating behavior is found on both sides of the superconducting region ii , but they show different fe vacancy ordering . in region",
    "i with @xmath21 , fe vacancy order with a * q@xmath2*=(1/4 , 3/4 , 0 ) is observed while in region iii with @xmath22 , the fe vacancy order has a wave vector of * q@xmath23*=(1/5 , 3/5,0 ) .",
    "it has been found that all the samples with a chemical formula k@xmath24fe@xmath25se@xmath2 are insulators ; superconductivity can be obtained only by adding extra fe content if keeping the potassium content @xmath12 at 0.8 .",
    "therefore the stoichiometric a@xmath26fe@xmath27se@xmath2 compound was proposed to be the parent compound of the a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors which is an afm insulator@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compounds show peculiar resistivity - temperature dependence .",
    "as shown in fig.1b , in addition to an abrupt superconducting transition at 31 k , the resistivity of k@xmath26fe@xmath2se@xmath2 superconductor exhibits a broad hump around 140@xmath3150 k(t@xmath28 ) where there appears to be an insulator - metal transition@xcite .",
    "such a hump is common in other a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors@xcite .",
    "it was found that the hump maximum temperature ( t@xmath28 ) depends sensitively on the type of @xmath29 atom@xcite and the fe content@xcite .",
    "it shows little change with the applied magnetic field@xcite .",
    "pressure can gradually suppress the magnitude of the hump with a slight increase of t@xmath28@xcite .",
    "it changes non - monotonically with isovalent substitution of se with sulfur in k@xmath0fe@xmath1(se@xmath30s@xmath31)@xcite .",
    "when comparing to the magnetic susceptibility , no corresponding anomaly is found at the temperature of the broad hump , suggesting it may not be a magnetic transition@xcite . moreover",
    ", structural analysis reveals no structural transition around t@xmath28@xcite .",
    "it is possible that such a resistivity hump is related to the phase separation , as will be discussed below .      as mentioned before ,",
    "the stoichiometry of synthesized samples always deviate from the ideal afe@xmath2se@xmath2 due to the restriction of the fe valence .",
    "iron vacancy would form an ordered state in fe - deficient a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 as reported years ago@xcite .",
    "because of the discovery of superconductivity , many new experimental studies have been carried out recently which have revealed different types of iron ordering in a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 by transmission electron microscope ( tem)@xcite , neutron scattering@xcite , x - ray diffraction ( xrd)@xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite .",
    "up to now , five different phases were found ( fig.3 ) which include vacancy free phase(fig.3a ) , @xmath32 superstructure phase(fig.3b ) , @xmath33 superstructure phase(fig.3c ) , @xmath34 superstructure phase(fig.3d ) and @xmath35 superstructure phase . from the iron ordering pattern , the fe content of @xmath32 superstructure phase corresponds to 1.6 and its stoichiometry can be written as k@xmath26fe@xmath27se@xmath2 or k@xmath2fe@xmath36se@xmath37(245 phase ) if undoped .",
    "similarly , both stoichiometries of @xmath33 and @xmath34 superstructure phases can be written as k@xmath2fe@xmath38se@xmath36(234 phase i and 234 phase ii respectively ) .",
    "table i summarizes observed superstructures in different a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 samples . the vacancy free phase has been observed only in superconducting samples while the @xmath34 superstructure is observed only in insulators .",
    "the other three superstructures were observed both in superconducting and insulating samples . compared with other phases that are related to iron vacancy ,",
    "the origin of the @xmath35 superstructure has not reached a consensus .",
    "it was observed by tem@xcite , xrd@xcite and neutron scattering@xcite , suggesting it is related to the lattice . but the stm results suggest it may have a magnetic origin@xcite .",
    "temperature dependent neutron scattering studies on k@xmath0fe@xmath39se@xmath2 compounds with various iron content were reported by bao _",
    "et al_. and a phase diagram was proposed as shown in fig .",
    "4@xcite . at high temperature ,",
    "all samples show tetragonal thcr@xmath2si@xmath2 structure with i4/mmm group symmetry and both k and fe sites are partially occupied in random . as temperature goes down , for insulator compounds with low iron content , two vacancy",
    "ordered state with i4/m(@xmath32 superstructure ) and pmna(@xmath34 superstructure ) group symmetry appear and coexist with i4/mmm phase between 295 k and 500 k. only @xmath32 superstructure phase exists when temperature is further lowered below 295 k. for superconductors with higher iron content , vacancy ordered state with i4/m group symmetry develops after the structure transition at 500 k and maintains to the lowest temperature even below t@xmath9 , indicating the superconductivity may coexist with the @xmath32 superstructure .    so far it is hard to prepare single phase a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 samples , especially superconducting ones . for superconducting samples , it is common to observe two sets of _ c _ lattice constants , even for single crystal samples@xcite .",
    "the coexistence of multiple phases has been observed in tem@xcite and stm@xcite results(see fig.5 ) .",
    "while phase separation is possible along the a - b plane , it is interesting to see that , in the superconducting samples , tem revealed that the fe - vacancy disorder state ( dos ) and order state ( os ) alternate along the _",
    "c_-axis direction ( see fig.5a ) .",
    "the temperature evolution of the phase separation was also investigated by xrd studies on a k@xmath26fe@xmath27se@xmath2 superconductor@xcite . at high temperature above 600 k , no superstructure was found and it is a vacancy - disordered tetragonal phase .",
    "after formation of @xmath32 superlattice at 580 k , the ( 220 ) peak splits and another set of superstructure spots appears at 520k , which can be assigned to @xmath35 superlattice .",
    "using nanofocused xrd on different parts of the sample , the proportion of these two phases is found to vary from one part to another@xcite .",
    "it remains to see whether a pure a@xmath8fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconducting sample can be prepared or the phase separation is an intrinsic process for superconducting samples .",
    "it has been well - established that the parent compounds of feas1111 , feas122 and feas111 have collinear magnetic structure while the fech11 phase ( fete ) has a bi - collinear magnetic structure@xcite . for the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compound ,",
    "the magnetic structures with different iron vacancy ordering are predicted from the theoretical calculations , as summarized in fig.3 .",
    "for the hypothetical stoichiometric afe@xmath2se@xmath2 compound@xcite , the ground state shows a bi - collinear antiferromagnetic order , with the fe moments having collinear antiferromagnetic order in each bipartite sublattice ( fig.3a ) .",
    "it results from se @xmath40 orbitals mediated super - exchange interactions of fe moments , similar to the fech11 compound@xcite . for the 245 phase with the @xmath32 superstructure@xcite",

    "c _ axis and four nearest iron atoms forming a cluster(fig.3b ) .",
    "it is ferromagnetic(fm ) within one cluster and antiferromagnetic between the adjacent clusters .",
    "two different magnetic structures were predicted in the compound with the same 234 stoichiometry . for the square ordered 234 phase i@xcite , the magnetic structure is _",
    "c_-afm order in which the next - nearest fe moments are ordered in antiparallel if one just ignores the iron vacancy(fig.3c ) . for the rhombus ordered 234 phase ii@xcite , it has an a - collinear afm order magnetic structure where the fe moments are antiferromagnetically ordered along the line without vacancies(fig.3d ) .",
    "block afm structure of the 245 phase with the @xmath32 superstructure was established from neutron diffraction on both polycrystalline samples@xcite and single crystal samples@xcite .",
    "6 shows the development of the block afm structure of the 245 phase in various a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , cs , ( tl , k ) , ( tl , rb ) ) samples@xcite .",
    "the antiferromagnetic n@xmath13el temperature(t@xmath41 ) , structural transition temperature(t@xmath42 ) and magnetic moment of different a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 samples measured by different experimental techniques are summarized in table ii . because the establishment of the block afm is based on the formation of the @xmath32 superstructure , t@xmath41 is always slightly lower than t@xmath42 , except for a k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 insulator where the two transitions occur at nearly the same temperature@xcite .",
    "the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compounds have a rather high n@xmath13el temperature ( above 500 k ) , and large magnetic moment ( up to 3@xmath43/fe ) which is the largest among all fe - based compounds .",
    "as mentioned above , due to the existence of multiple phases in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 samples , it remains unclear which phase is really superconducting .",
    "a related issue is whether antiferromagnetism and superconductivity can coexist in the system .",
    "on the one hand , coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 was proposed from results of neutron scattering@xcite , transport measurements@xcite , @xmath44sr@xcite , m@xmath45ssbauer@xcite and raman scattering@xcite .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "6 , the magnetic bragg intensity from the @xmath32 superstructure shows a kink around t@xmath9 , indicating that the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are coupled@xcite . on the other hand , m@xmath45ssbauer spectroscopy studies on rb@xmath26fe@xmath27se@xmath2 superconductor revealed the presence of 88@xmath46 magnetic and 12@xmath46 non - magnetic fe@xmath47 species which could be attributed to the @xmath32 superstructure phase and vacancy free phase , respectively@xcite .",
    "stm results also indicate that the superconductivity comes from the vacancy free phase and the @xmath32 superstructure phase is an insulator(fig.b - d)@xcite .",
    "further work are needed to reconcile these seemingly conflicting results .",
    "recently , hu _ et al .",
    "_ proposed@xcite that the vacancy order free phase(also superconducting phase ) may have block - afm ground state as well , similar to that in @xmath32 superstructure phase . since these two block - afm states can be described by the same magnetic model",
    ", two separated phases can couple with each other in one sample .",
    "the spin dynamics of the insulating rb@xmath48fe@xmath49se@xmath2 compound with a @xmath32 superstructure has been investigated by inelastic neutron scattering(ins)@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "7 , the spin waves exist in three separated energy ranges . the lowest branch , which is an acoustic mode arising mostly from antiferromagnetic interactions of the fm blocked spins@xcite , starts from 9 mev to 70 mev . the other two branches , which are optical spin waves associated with exchange interactions of iron spins within the fm blocks , are from 80 mev to 140 mev and 180 mev to 230 mev respectively .",
    "the magnetic exchange couplings , obtained by fitting the data with effective @xmath50 heisenberg model , are summarized in table iii , together with those in fe@xmath51te@xcite and cafe@xmath2as@xmath2@xcite for comparison .",
    "although their static antiferromagnetic orders have completely different structures , these three iron - based compounds have comparable effective exchange couplings @xmath52 , which is mainly determined by a local superexchange mediated by as or se / te@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that @xmath52 is the leading parameter of ground magnetic state and closely related to superconductivity in the fe - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "it is predicted that , if there is a sign change in the superconducting order parameter , a spin resonance mode with an energy between one and two times of the superconducting gap would appear at the wave vector connecting two parts of the fermi surface with opposite gap signs@xcite . the spin resonance mode , generally taken as a hallmark of unconventional pairing symmetry of superconductivity , has been observed in cuperate superconductors@xcite , heavy fermion superconductors@xcite and the fe - based superconductors@xcite . such a resonance mode has also been revealed in rb@xmath26fe@xmath27se@xmath2 superconductor@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "8 , the intensity is obviously enhanced at 14 mev across t@xmath9 at a wave vector ( 0.5 , 0.3125 , 0.5 ) , in contrast to ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) where the resonance has been theoretically predicted in d - wave pairing symmetry@xcite or ( 0.5 , 0 , 0.5 ) where it is usually found in other fe - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of the measured resonance intensity follows an order - parameter - like increase below t@xmath9 , indicating it is related to the superconducting transition ( fig.8c ) .",
    "the ratio of @xmath53 is 5.1@xmath70.4 , slightly above the nearly universal ratio of 4.3 estimated for 122-compounds , but is close to that in fete@xmath24se@xmath0 , lifeas , la-1111 , and cuprate superconductors@xcite .",
    "another scaling parameter 2@xmath54 would be 0.7@xmath70.1 , if taking the superconducting gap as 10 mev measured by arpes@xcite .",
    "it is slightly larger than the typical value of 0.64 for cuprates but smaller than 1 , following the general trend found in all fe - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "it is expected that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , which is proposed to be a strong candidate of the pairing glue in the fe - based superconductors and has been observed in 11-type iron - chalcogenide and iron - pnictide superconductors , would introduce a curie - weiss upturn near t@xmath9 in 1/(t@xmath23 t ) in the nuclear magnetic resonance measurements@xcite",
    ". however , no indication of such an enhancement is detected in several a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2(a = k , ( tl , rb ) ) superconductors so far@xcite .",
    "instead , the results are more similar to the overdoped non - supercondcting 122-type iron - pnictide superconductors where the absence of curie - weiss upturn was interpreted as due to the lack of nesting between the hole and electron fermi surface sheets because the hole band sinks below the fermi level by electron doping .",

    "12b)@xcite . in ( tl , k)@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors@xcite , in additional to two electron bands , two hole bands(denoted as ga and gb in fig.12j ) below the fermi level are observed . around @xmath74 , one electron - like band",
    "is clearly observed ( fig .",
    "12c and 12d ) . but a more detailed measurements ( fig .",
    "12e and 12f ) indicate that the band is composed of two bands with similar fermi momenta but with different band bottoms , one at @xmath3 40 mev and the other at @xmath360 mev ( fig .",
    "the k@xmath75 dependence of these bands are obtained by arpes using different photon energies@xcite .",
    "as shown in fig.13 , the band crossings around @xmath74 do not change much at different k@xmath75 , indicative of their quasi - two - dimensional nature .",
    "however , the electron - like @xmath4 band near @xmath6 exhibits obvious k@xmath75 dependence : an electron - like band crosses the fermi level near @xmath66 but it is above the fermi level near @xmath6@xcite .    the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconducting compounds exhibit similar fermi surface topology , as summarized in fig .",
    "they all show two electron - like pockets around @xmath6 ( denoted as @xmath4 and @xmath73 ) and one electron - like pocket around @xmath74 ( @xmath76 ) which is in fact composed of two nearly degenerate fermi surface sheets . around @xmath6 point ,",
    "no fermi surface sheet or only one small sheet were first reported in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and cs@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2@xcite .",
    "later results on ( tl , rb)@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 with improved data quality revealed two electron - like fermi surface sheets around @xmath6@xcite .",
    "this distinct fermi surface topology was further confirmed by other measurements of ( tl , k)@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2@xcite , making it a common fermi - surface topology in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors . by calculating the enclosed area of all measured fermi pockets ,",
    "the doping concentration can be estimated to be 0.27 e / fe for ( tl@xmath77rb@xmath78fe@xmath79se@xmath2@xcite and 0.32 e / fe for ( tl@xmath80k@xmath81fe@xmath82se@xmath2@xcite .",
    "it is 0.18 e / fe for both compounds , if only the two degenerate pockets around m are counted .",
    "it is noted that the measured fermi surface and band structure of the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors are qualitatively consistent with band structure calculations on the vacancy free afe@xmath2se@xmath2 phase ( fig .",
    "one outstanding difference is the @xmath73 fermi surface sheet around @xmath6 ( fig.13 ) that is absent in the band calculations .",
    "we note here that , since the exact superconducting phase in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 remains unclear , one should be cautious in making such a direct comparison to jump into some conclusions .",
    "an immediate issue is on the origin of this @xmath73 fermi surface .",
    "the first possibility is a surface state .",
    "while surface state on some fe - based compounds like the feas1111 system was reported before@xcite , it has not been observed in the ",
    "11\"-type fe(se , te ) system@xcite .",
    "the second possibility is whether the @xmath73 band can be caused by the folding of the electron - like @xmath76 fermi surface near @xmath74 .",
    "it is noted that the fermi surface size , the band dispersion , and the band width of the @xmath73 band at @xmath6 is similar to that of the @xmath76 band near @xmath74 .",
    "a band folding picture would give a reasonable account for such a similarity if there exists a ( @xmath83,@xmath83 ) modulation in the system that can be either structural or magnetic .",
    "an obvious issue with this scenario is that , in this case , one should also expect the folding of the @xmath4 band near @xmath6 onto the @xmath74 point ; but such a folding is not observed at the @xmath74 point ( fig . 12c and fig .",
    "the third possibility is whether the measured @xmath73 sheet is a fermi surface at a special k@xmath75 cut . due to its weak intensity",
    ", this @xmath73 fermi surface is not revealed in the k@xmath75 dependence measurements ( fig.13 ) .",
    "but almost the same fermi crossing was observed with three different energies(6.994 ev , 21.2 ev and 40.8 ev ) , implying it is nearly two - dimensional - like@xcite .",
    "note that this @xmath73 fermi surface should not be confused with the @xmath4 pocket at @xmath66 because they have very different size , particularly they are observed simultaneously near @xmath6 point .",
    "the origin of the @xmath73 fermi surface is still an open question to be further addressed .",
    "it is under debate whether the superconducting phase in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 coexists with the fe vacancy ordered @xmath32 phase@xcite .",
    "under such a circumstance , one would expect the brillouin zone for the @xmath32 phase to be 1/5 of the original 1@xmath841 phase ( fig .",
    "the @xmath32 superstructure would produce multiple folded fermi surface sheets from the original one pocket near m or near @xmath6 .",
    "however , no indication of such folded fermi surface sheets are observed in the measured results ( fig . 14 ) .",
    "while one can not fully rule out that the folded fermi surface is not seen because they may be too weak , their absence is not compatible with the scenario of coexistence of superconductivity and the @xmath32 superstructure .",
    "the same argument is also applicable to other possible ordered superstructures like the @xmath85 and @xmath33 phases .",
    "study on the electronic structure evolution from an insulator to a superconductor is helpful in addressing the key issue on what the parent compound is for the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "valence bands were measured on three types of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 compounds ( insulator , semiconductor and superconductor)@xcite . comparing with a superconductor ,",
    "no band was observed within the 0.5 ev energy range below e@xmath64 in an antiferromagnetically insulating sample .",
    "two high energy features around 0.7 ev and 1.6 ev binding energies were observed in all three type of samples .",
    "it was found that , by increasing the temperature or reducing the photon intensity , these two features shift toward low binding energy , which is typical behavior called charging effect in photoemission measurements on insulating samples . on the other hand ,",
    "no such charging effect was observed in low energy feature of a superconductor .",
    "therefore , the high energy features ( 0.7 ev and 1.6 ev ) and low energy near - e@xmath64 features may not come from the same phase in the sample : the former may come from the insulating phase while the latter from metallic or superconducting phase .",
    "similar phase separation behavior was also found in the semiconducting sample .",
    "such results are consisting with the phase separation picture also revealed by tem@xcite and stm@xcite .",
    "in contrast to the dramatic difference between the electronic structure of the insulating and superconducting phases , the low energy features of the semiconductor are reminiscent to those in the superconducting sample . as illustrated in fig .",
    "15b , only hole - like band with a band gap of @xmath320 mev was observed around @xmath6 .",
    "the band structure of the semiconductor seems to resemble that of the superconductor by shifting the chemical potential of the superconductor downwards by 55 mev and coincidentally the chemical potential lies in the gap between the electron and hole bands .",
    "no shadow band possibly caused by magnetic order or lattice superstructure was observed in this semiconductor .",
    "these observations led the authors@xcite to propose that the actual parent compound of k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductor is not the insulating phase , but the semiconducting phase ; superconductivity can be obtained by doping the semiconductor . more work needs to be done to confirm this interesting scenario .",
    "arpes can directly measure superconducting gap and its momentum dependence , thus providing key information on the pairing symmetry of superconductivity .",
    "first shows typical arpes results on measuring temperature dependence of superconducting gap in ( tl , rb)@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductor@xcite .",
    "the photoemission data are taken on different fermi surface sheets at different temperatures ( fig .",
    "16a and 16e ) and the photoemission spectra ( energy distribution curves , edcs ) on the fermi surface are symmetrized ( fig .",
    "16c and 16f ) to visualize the superconducting gap opening and obtain the gap size .",
    "it is clear that for both the @xmath73 and @xmath76 fermi surface sheets the superconducting gap opens right below t@xmath9=32 k. also the quasiparticle peak sharpens up while entering the superconducting state . as seen in fig .",
    "16b , a sharp quasiparticle peak with a narrow width of only 9 mev ( full - width - at - half - maximum ) is observed at low temperature for the @xmath76 fermi surface near @xmath74 .",
    "the superconducting gap size can be determined by taking the edc peak position . as seen in fig .",
    "16d , the temperature dependence of gap size on the @xmath76 fermi surface near @xmath74 follows the standard bcs form with a @xmath869.7 mev@xcite",
    ". similar temperature dependence of the superconducting gap is also reported in other a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , ( tl , k ) ) superconductors , but with different gap sizes@xcite .",
    "with respect to the small @xmath4 pocket , no gap opening was detected in ( tl , rb)@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 because the band is slightly above the fermi level near @xmath6@xcite .",
    "a superconducting gap of @xmath37 mev was reported below t@xmath9 in k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 on the @xmath4 fermi surface near @xmath66 with a clear fermi crossing@xcite .",
    "the arpes measurements on different a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , ( tl , k ) , ( tl , rb ) ) superconductors give nearly isotropic superconducting gap on the @xmath76 fermi surface around @xmath74@xcite ( fig .",
    "in order to measure the momentum - dependent superconducting gap on the weak @xmath73 fermi surface around @xmath6 , high resolution laser - based arpes measurements have been performed which also give a nearly isotropic superconducting gap ( fig .",
    "it was also found that the gap sizes on both @xmath4 and @xmath76 fermi surface sheets show little variation at different fermi crossing along k@xmath75@xcite .",
    "so far no evidence of gap node is observed in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "the low - temperature specific heat measurement@xcite and nmr measurement@xcite also suggest a nodeless gap .",
    "the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements , which reveal the averaged electronic structure of the entire brillion zone , show a 7 mev superconducting gap in the cleaved k@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 sample@xcite . for thin film sample grown by mbe , however , two superconducting gaps with much smaller size , 1 mev and 4 mev , were reported(fig.5c)@xcite .",
    "table iv summarizes the superconducting gap size of different a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 samples measured by different techniques .",
    "the ratio of 2@xmath87/k@xmath88t@xmath9 obtained from single crystal samples is larger than the traditional bcs weak - coupling value of 3.54 , which indicates that a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductor is in a strong - coupling regime in the bcs picture . on the other hand ,",
    "the small ratio of 0.9 and 3.5 obtained in mbe - grown film samples puts it in a weak - coupling regime .",
    "this difference between the bulk samples and film samples needs to be further clarified .    in the fe - based superconductors",
    ", it has been proposed that the interband scattering between the hole - like bands near @xmath6 and the electron - like bands near @xmath74 gives rise to electron pairing and superconductivity with a s@xmath7 symmetry ( fig .",
    "18 , left panel)@xcite . with the absence of hole - like fermi surface around @xmath6 ,",
    "this picture is no longer applicable in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors . in this case , from a weak coupling point of view , the repulsive inter - electron - pocket pair scattering between two @xmath74 pockets ( fig .",
    "18 , right panel ) would give a d@xmath5 pairing symmetry@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the viewpoint of a doped mott insulator , by calculating the @xmath89 model , both s - wave and d - wave pairing are possible at different regions of phase diagram@xcite .",
    "but s - wave pairing symmetry is robust if the antiferromagnetic @xmath52 is the main factor for pairing and the @xmath90 is ferromagnetic@xcite .",
    "it is also proposed that orbital order and its fluctuations would give rise to a s++ wave pairing with the presence of a moderate electron - phonon interaction@xcite .",
    "the observation of a nearly isotropic , nodeless superconducting gap in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors favors an s - wave pairing symmetry .",
    "it is also considered to be consistent with a nodeless d - wave pairing because the d - wave node is along the diagonal of 1 fe brillouin zone ( fig.18 , right panel ) ; the @xmath76 fermi surface sheet may show a nearly isotropic gap because it does not cross this node line . however , as pointed out by mazin@xcite , if there is a sign change between the ( 0,-@xmath83 ) fermi pocket and ( @xmath83,0 ) pocket , gap node would still be expected at the crossing points of two fermi pockets around the same @xmath74 point due to the folding from 1 fe brillouin zone to 2 fe brillouin zone which is then inconsistent with existing experimental results . up to now",
    "no conclusive answer to the pairing symmetry of the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors has been reached yet .",
    "we note that , the weak @xmath73 fermi pocket around @xmath6 crosses the node line in d - wave pairing , if it is proven to be intrinsic , its nearly isotropic gap ( fig .",
    "17d)@xcite could rule out the d - wave pairing scenario .",
    "the coupling between electron and boson modes plays an important role in giving rise to the electron pairing .",
    "such a coupling can be probed directly by arpes by measuring the electron self - energy which manifests itself as a kink structure on a band dispersion@xcite .",
    "a number of phonon modes are observed in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = k , rb , tl ) superconductors by raman scattering and optical studies@xcite .",
    "a magnetic resonance mode has been predicted@xcite and observed ( fig .",
    "8) in the superconducting state of rb@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 at an energy of 14 mev@xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the electronic dynamics in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "19 shows the measured band dispersion of the ( tl , rb)@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductor around @xmath74 point at different temperatures , together with the extracted effective imaginary and real parts of the electron self - energy@xcite .",
    "the transition near 7 mev in the real part of electron self - energy ( fig .",
    "19c ) is caused by the superconducting gap opening and is not the effect of electron - boson coupling . except for this feature ,",
    "no obvious dispersion kink is observed in the real part of self - energy at both normal and superconducting states .",
    "these observations indicate that the electron - boson coupling is weak in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors .",
    "although it has been only one year since the discovery of the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors , significant progress has been made in studying their unique structural , magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "unique characteristics have been revealed and studied , such as the existence of fe vacancy and its ordering , the novel magnetic structure of block antiferromagnetism with large magnetic moment and high n@xmath13el temperature , and the possible insulating nature of its parent compound . in particular ,",
    "key insights have been drawn in understanding the pairing mechanism of the fe - based superconductors with its distinct electronic structure , i.e. , with the absence of hole - like fermi surface around @xmath6 , high t@xmath9 ( @xmath330 k at ambient pressure and 48 k under pressure ) is achieved in this system .",
    "on the other hand , there are complications and open questions around this new system . first and foremost ,",
    "what is the exact superconducting phase in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors ?",
    "stm and arpes data favor fe - vacancy - free a@xmath0fe@xmath67se@xmath2 phase , but neutron scattering and raman studies indicate that superconductivity is associated with the fe - vacancy ordered @xmath32 superstructure phase .",
    "the answer becomes complicated due to the existence of multiple phases in the superconducting samples which leads to another question of phase separation .",
    "is the phase separation in the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors inevitable or a problem of sample preparation ? can the phase separation properly account for many unusual properties observed so far ?",
    "the final answer to the superconducting phase will help in answering the question of its parent compound : whether it is an insulator , or a semiconductor , or a poor metal .",
    "of course , the ultimately important issue is to reveal the pairing mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "to conclude , the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 superconductors provide a new platform for investigating the properties and mechanism of superconductivity .",
