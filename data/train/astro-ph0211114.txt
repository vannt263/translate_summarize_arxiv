    "blazars are traditionally distincted in bl lac objects , characterized by lower redshift and lower luminosity , and highly polarized quasars or flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , having higher redshift and luminosity , and stronger emission lines ( urry & padovani 1995 ) . the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars ( in @xmath1 representation ) are characterized by two humps , one peaking at lower frequencies ( from far - infrared to soft x - rays and occasionally soft @xmath0-rays ) , due to the synchrotron process , and the other correspondingly peaking between the mev and tev energies , produced by inverse compton scattering of relativistic particles off jet radiation ( synchrotron self - compton ) or photons external to the jet , such as broad emission lines or accretion disk photons ( external compton ) .",
    "this phenomenology has prompted for the subdivision of bl lac objects in low frequency - peaked ( lbl ) and high frequency - peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) .",
    "fsrqs have synchrotron and inverse compton peaks located at the lowest frequencies in the above indicated ranges .",
    "the x - ray spectra of blazars present different shapes according to whether the blazar belongs to one sub - class or the other . in hbls the x - ray emission has generally a steep spectrum because it corresponds to the hard tail of the synchrotron component , and therefore traces the behavior of the population of the highest energy electrons .",
    "the x - ray spectral variability is larger in hbl than in other sub - classes , and can be dramatic in some sources , causing the peak energy of the x - ray power to move to energies higher than @xmath210 kev .",
    "this has prompted for the definition of the class of  extreme synchrotron blazars \" ( e.g. , ghisellini 1999 ) .",
    "on the other hand , in fsrqs and lbls the x - ray spectrum is produced by inverse compton scattering of those electrons which are responsible for the radio emission , and therefore is generally hard , modestly variable , and allows us to obtain indirect information on a spectral region which is often self - absorbed . in objects intermediate between lbls and hbls ( ibl )",
    "the x - ray frequencies correspond to the energy region where the synchrotron and inverse compton components overlap and have comparable power .",
    "consistently , the flux varies only at soft x - ray energies ( where the variable synchrotron dominates ) , while it is rather steady at hard x - ray energies , being produced by scattering of less energetic electrons ( tagliaferri et al . 2000 ; ravasio et al . 2002 ) .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have suggested a scenario whereby all blazars lie on a sequence governed by a single physical parameter , their bolometric luminosity . in more luminous blazars ,",
    "electrons radiate more efficiently due to interaction with strong external radiation fields ( accretion disk and/or emission lines ) and therefore attain less extreme energies than less luminous blazars , the hbls .",
    "this picture , although justified on a physical basis by ghisellini & celotti ( 2002 ) , maraschi & tavecchio ( 2002 ) , bttcher & dermer ( 2002 ) , cavaliere & delia ( 2002 ) , is not free from controversy ( e.g. , giommi et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "the x - ray behavior of blazars has been studied in the latest years by many satellites , as recently reviewed by donato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , maraschi & tavecchio ( 2001 ) , giommi et al .",
    "( 2002b ) , pian ( 2002 ) . the recent demise of the x - ray satellite bepposax ( 0.1 - 100 kev ) makes it appropriate to review some of its main contributions in the study of blazar multiwavelength energy distributions .",
    "these will be presented here by following the logic of the blazar sequence discussed in the previous section . at the end ,",
    "open problems and investigation perspectives in the near future will be outlined .",
    "we have undertaken a program of bepposax observations of high redshift fsrqs .",
    "thanks to the wide x - ray energy coverage of bepposax , we could explore and model their sed in detail , compute the energy content of the jet , and compare it with the power extractable from the central black hole ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; tavecchio et al .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of our fsrq targets is rather hard , generally well described by a single power - law . by combining the bepposax with data at other frequencies from radio to @xmath0-rays , and modeling the sed assuming a homogeneous region it is found that the x - ray and @xmath0-ray spectra are accounted for by synchrotron self - compton and external compton radiation , respectively ( fig . 1 , left ) .",
    "this conclusion holds also for one of the best studied fsrq , 3c  279 , at an intermediate redshift of @xmath3 , which has often been a target for simultaneous radio - to-@xmath0-rays observing campaigns ( hartman et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "ballo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have collected many seds of this source at different epochs , including january 1997 , when the source was observed by bepposax ( fig .",
    "1 , right ) , and have adopted an internal shock scenario ( spada et al . 2001 ) to reproduce the multiwavelength variability .",
    "this scenario , which has been introduced to interpret the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( piran 1999 ) , envisages relativistic perturbances ( shells ) propagating with different lorentz factors down the jet . once a fast moving shell catches up with a slower shell ahead , they collide producing an observed flare .",
    "this picture accounts well also for the variability of 3c  279 as well as for less powerful blazars ( guetta et al .",
    "2002 ) , and allows for rapid variations of the bulk lorentz factor , thus alleviating the difficulty of a rapid , large change of this parameter in a single relativistic blob .",
    "in fact , the internal shock scenario requires that the lorentz factors of the different shells differ by much , if high radiative efficiency is to be provided .",
    "the multiwavelength sed of pks  0537441 , a typical lbl , has been sampled at different epochs , and reproduced with a synchrotron and inverse compton model in a homogeneous region ( fig .",
    "2 , left ) , where the observed variability is accounted for by a small variation of the plasma bulk lorentz factor , consistent with an internal shock scenario ( a small change in the high energy tail of the electron energy distribution is also required ) . similarly to the fsrq case , the inverse compton component is produced by scattering of relativistic particles off both synchrotron photons ( mainly responsible for the x - ray spectrum , observed also by bepposax in 1998 ) and external photons ( accounting for the @xmath0-ray spectrum ) .",
    "this external radiation field is mainly identified with broad line emission , which is prominent in the uv spectrum ( ly@xmath4 and c  iv emission lines , pian et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the relevance of the external radiation field ( broad emission line region ) in modeling the sed of bl lac objects has been recognized also in the class prototype source , bl lac itself , which has an intermediate behavior between lbl and hbl , with the synchrotron peak located at optical frequencies . in this object , the x - ray spectrum , sampled in detail with bepposax at two different epochs ( june and december 1999 ) , was observed to vary substantially in shape ( ravasio et al .",
    "2002 ; see fig .",
    "2 , right ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the multiwavelength emission may occur at different radii from the central compact object , and specifically at different locations with respect to the broad line region .",
    "this would cause a different significance of the role of line photons in the inverse compton scattering .",
    "the model predicts different levels of emission in the mev - gev band , depending on whether the scattering takes place within or outside the broad line region .    in hbls",
    "the x - ray spectrum usually corresponds to the high energy tail of the synchrotron component and therefore exhibits remarkable variability both in slope and flux normalization .",
    "simultaneous near - infrared and bepposax observations have allowed tagliaferri et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to precisely define , thanks to the wide x - ray energy coverage , the shape of the electron energy distribution in the hbl pks  2005489 . the most accurate studies and correlations of blazar x - ray flux and spectrum variability",
    "have been accomplished for the prototypical hbls pks  2155304 and mkn  421 , the brightest x - ray blazars",

    "2001 ; zhang et al . 2002 ; zhang 2002 ; see also references cited in these papers ) .",
    "bepposax has observed pks  2155304 at various epochs ( giommi et al . 1998 ; chiappetti et al . 1999 ;",
    "zhang et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a homogeneous model where the high energy spectrum is dominated by synchrotron self - compton radiation accounts well for the sed of both sources , which have been observed up to the tev energies .",
    "the variability can be reproduced by sole variations of the break energy of the relativistic electrons , @xmath5 ( chiappetti et al .",
    "1999 , see also fig .",
    "3 , left ; maraschi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "an xmm monitoring of pks  2155304 in november 2000 detected pronounced frequency - dependent variability amplitude ( fig .",
    "3 , right ) .",
    "since the structure functions of the light curves at optical - to - x - ray frequencies are similar , it is argued that a unique emission mechanism is responsible for emission over this energy range ( maraschi et al .",
    "the results of the correlation analysis of the x - ray light curves of this source appear to indicate that different time lags are detected at different brightness states ( zhang et al . 1999 ; edelson et al . 2001 ; zhang et al . 2002 ; maraschi et al .",
    "the tentative conclusion that variability is driven by different mechanisms , depending on the source state , must be supported by further observations .",
    "the detection of the x - ray bright bl lac mkn  501 in outburst by bepposax in april 1997 has revealed an exceptionally hard x - ray spectrum , peaking at or beyond @xmath2100 kev ( catanese et al .",
    "1997 ; pian et al .",
    "1998 ; tavecchio et al .",
    "2001 ) , to be compared with an x - ray peak energy of @xmath20.1 - 0.5 kev in quiescence ( fig .",
    "4 , left ) . since the x - ray emission in this source is likely produced by synchrotron radiation , this dramatic spectral variation , accompanied by a large increase of the tev flux ,",
    "must imply a shift of the synchrotron peak energy by at least 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "this finding has prompted for the search of other ",
    "extreme synchrotron blazars \" , i.e. sources normally classified as hbls , but possibly having synchrotron peak energies over @xmath21 kev in active states . a systematic search has detected more sources with peak energies at or above 1 kev , notably 1es 2344 + 514 ( giommi , padovani & perlman 2000 ) , mkn  421 ( fossati 2001 ) , and 1es 1426 + 428 ( costamante et al .",
    "2001 ) . since in extreme",
    "synchrotron blazars the shift in the spectral peak with respect to energy is caused by an increase of the maximum electron energy , these sources should have considerable tev emission and must be best candidates for detection with cherenkov telescopes ( costamante & ghisellini 2002 ) .",
    "bepposax has allowed an accurate spectral investigation of the blazar x - ray emission over an unprecedented simultaneous coverage of nearly three decades in energy . for fsrqs and lbls ,",
    "bepposax has generally sampled the synchrotron self - compton component ( see however padovani et al .",
    "the multiwavelength variability in some representative cases of this class of sources can be reproduced with changes of the bulk lorentz factor of the relativistic plasma , possibly via an internal shock scenario .",
    "the x - ray spectra of ibls are consistent with a superposition of synchrotron and inverse compton components .",
    "accordingly , significant flux variability is detected only at low x - ray energies .",
    "hbls have variable x - ray emission and steep x - ray spectra , produced by synchrotron radiation . some exhibit substantial spectral hardening and consequent large shifts of the synchrotron peak toward higher energies , mainly ( but not necessarily ) during outbursts",
    ". this spectral variability can be reproduced by sole changes of the electrons @xmath5 .",
    "more observations of blazars of all classes during active states are necessary to better understand the exact jet physics ( i.e. , how the particle acceleration and cooling mechanisms work ) , and the interaction between the jet and the external , more isotropic radiation components ( broad emission line region , accretion disk , dusty torus ) .",
    "integral will cover the soft @xmath0-ray and x - ray energy ranges , optimally suited for this investigation , and will have sufficient sensitivity to perform variability studies on intraday time scales .",
    "essential support to the integral campaigns will be provided by the small and medium size ground - based telescopes , especially for the monitoring of fsrqs , lbls , and ibls , expected to be highly variable in optical during active states . the combination of optical and near - infrared data ( provided by the robotic telescope rem , zerbi et al . 2001 ) will allow us to study in detail the correlation between flux and spectral variability during the source outbursts .",
    "a crucial role will be played by polarimetry , which is a more direct probe of jet physics than the pure photometry ( e.g. , tommasi et al .",
    "2001 ; efimov et al .",
    "therefore , it will be important to organize systematic campaigns , coordinated with high energy observations with integral , in target - of - opportunity mode at telescopes endowed with polarimetric facilities , such as the nordic optical telescope .",
