    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are considered the leading candidates for the accelerators of cosmic - rays to at least the  knee \" of the cosmic - ray energy spectrum ( @xmath15 @xmath14 3000 tev ) .",
    "while the relationship between snrs and cosmic - ray acceleration has received extensive attention in the literature @xcite , most of this discussion has been theoretical , with only a limited amount of observational data to consider . one major unresolved issue related to cosmic - ray acceleration by snrs",
    "is the maximum energy @xmath15@xmath16 attained by cosmic - ray particles accelerated by the shock front : for samples of young shell - type x - ray emitting snrs located in the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud , @xcite and @xcite estimated values for @xmath15@xmath16 of @xmath17 200 tev and @xmath17 80 tev , respectively , both well below the cosmic - ray energy spectrum  knee . \"",
    "progress on this issue has been limited due to the lack of both x - ray and tev observations of snrs with the angular and spectral resolution needed to probe the acceleration process .",
    "recently , however , high spatial resolution observations of snrs at x - ray energies have become feasible for the first time using such x - ray observatories as @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these high resolution observations yield spatially - resolved spectroscopy of x - ray emitting features within the snr , particularly the x - ray luminous rims that are associated with the expanding shock fronts of snrs . by performing a detailed spectral analysis of x - ray emission from the rims of snrs , corresponding to shock fronts where",
    "interstellar or circumstellar material is being swept up , the cosmic - ray acceleration process may be probed .",
    "initial insights on cosmic - ray acceleration by snrs have been gleaned from @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 observations of the high - energy x - ray emission from such snrs as cas a and sn 1006 @xcite , but a thorough multi - wavelength study of snrs is required in order to obtain a detailed understanding of the cosmic - ray acceleration process .    in this paper , we present our analysis of the non - thermal x - ray emission from the galactic snr g347.3@xmath00.5 ( also known as rx j1713.7@xmath03949 ) . first discovered during the rntgensatellit ( @xmath1 ) all sky survey @xcite , this snr has attracted a considerable amount of interest from the astronomical community .",
    "g347.3@xmath00.5 is one of the brightest galactic x - ray snrs known with an x - ray flux density of 4.4 @xmath20 10@xmath21 erg @xmath22 s@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies of this snr based on @xmath1 and @xmath2 observations @xcite revealed that most of its x - ray emission is non - thermal and most likely produced by the synchrotron process . unlike the x - ray spectra typically seen from most other snrs , no thermal line emission was detected from any portion of g347.3@xmath00.5 by these previous studies .",
    "the detection of non - thermal x - ray emission from this snr has made g347.3@xmath00.5 one of the prime examples of an snr acting as an accelerator of cosmic - ray particles .",
    "in addition , @xcite detected emission from tev photons located on the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 : those authors argued that these photons were produced by the inverse - compton scattering process , with cosmic microwave background photons scattering off high - energy cosmic - ray electrons accelerated along the shock front of this snr .",
    "this result makes g347.3@xmath00.5 only the third shell - type snr besides sn 1006 @xcite and cas a @xcite reported to produce tev emission .",
    "a detailed analysis of the evolutionary state of g347.3@xmath00.5 using radio , x - ray and tev observations of the bright northwestern rim was given by @xcite .",
    "those authors also estimated the maximum energy of cosmic - ray protons accelerated by g347.3@xmath00.5 to be approximately 20 tev .",
    "@xcite argued that this snr is accelerating cosmic - ray nuclei as well as cosmic - ray electrons based on positional coincidence between the northeastern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 and the @xmath8-ray source 3eg j1714@xmath03857 @xcite , which is positionally coincident with a molecular cloud : this cloud is assumed to be interacting with g347.3@xmath00.5 .",
    "cosmic ray acceleration by this snr was also discussed by @xcite , who presented a tev spectrum for the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 and argued that this spectrum is best fit by the decay of neutral pion ( @xmath24@xmath25 ) particles rather than an inverse compton spectrum of upscattered cosmic background photons .",
    "these pions are presumed to be produced by the collision of cosmic - ray protons ( assumed to be accelerated by g347.3@xmath00.5 ) with protons in the molecular cloud , as described by @xcite .",
    "this result is in part based on the assumption that 3eg j1714@xmath03857 is associated with g347.4 - 0.5 and , if correct , would represent significant observational evidence for cosmic - ray proton acceleration by an snr @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have disputed the association with the @xmath8-ray source and instead claim that , while g347.3@xmath00.5 is very likely an accelerator of cosmic - ray electrons ,",
    "no convincing evidence yet exists that it accelerates hadrons as well .",
    "other recent work on g347.3@xmath00.5 includes modeling of the spectrum of ax j1714.1@xmath03912 , a hard x - ray source associated with 3eg j1714@xmath03857 @xcite , the discovery of fine - structure filaments associated with the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 @xcite and finally , a discussion of the flux of high energy neutrinos from the northwestern rim of this snr , assuming that the tev spectrum is produced by the decay of neutral pions , which yield neutrinos in the decay process @xcite . in this paper , we present a spatially - resolved broadband spectral analysis of g347.3@xmath00.5 in order to analyze the high energy emission from this snr and probe cosmic - ray acceleration by this source . like many galactic snrs ,",
    "the distance to g347.3@xmath00.5 and its age are not well known : early studies of this snr suggested a low distance of about 1 kpc assuming g347.3@xmath00.5 is in the sedov stage of evolution @xcite or that it is associated with the historical supernova of 393 a.d .",
    "@xcite . in addition",
    ", @xcite derived a distance of 1 kpc by comparing their measurement of the column density toward this source with the total column density in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "such a low distance suggests that g347.3@xmath00.5 is a young snr with an age of about 2000 years .",
    "however , a subsequent analysis by @xcite instead favored a larger distance of 6 kpc based on a postulated association between g347.3@xmath00.5 , an hii region and a complex of three molecular clouds : such a distance would imply a much greater age of about 10@xmath26 years . we will adopt a distance to g347.3@xmath00.5 of 6 kpc for this paper in order to be consistent with the analyses presented by @xcite and @xcite as well as the putative association between this snr and the recently discovered pulsar j1713 - 3949 , believed to lie at a distance of 5.0@xmath270.2 kpc based on measurements of its dispersion measure @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ obssection ] , we describe the observations of g347.3@xmath00.5 using _ rosat _ ( section [ rosatsubsection ] ) , _ asca _ ( section [ ascasubsection ] ) and _ rxte _ ( section [ rxtesubsection ] ) . while the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations have been presented previously , the _ rxte _ observations are presented here for the first time .",

    "these data sample the x - ray emission from g347.3@xmath00.5 over nearly two full decades of energy ( 0.5 kev to 30 kev ) . details of the observations for each instrument are provided in table [ obstable ] .      @xmath1  observed g347.3@xmath00.5 at a location near the center of the remnant using the pspc , a multiple - wire proportional counter sensitive to photons that have energies between approximately 0.1 and 2.0 kev .",

    "spectra were constructed using the pspc data for four spatially separate regions : the luminous northwestern and southwestern rims , the northeastern rim and the interior region .",
    "this final region was considered in order to analyze diffuse emission from the interior of the snr .",
    "emission from the two bright interior point sources  1wga j1714.4@xmath03945 and 1wga j1713.4@xmath03949 @xcite  were subtracted from this region before a spectrum was extracted .",

    "while both the gis and the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) aboard @xmath2 collected data during these observations , the gis has a larger field of view so only the data from the gis were considered for the present study .",
    "the gis consists of two units ( denoted as gis2 and gis3 ) of imaging gas scintillation proportional counters with a sealed - off gas cell equipped with an imaging phototube : for our research , we only considered data collected by the gis2 unit .",

    "the reduction process filtered data for elevation angle , stable pointing directions , the south atlantic anomaly and cut - off rigidity .",
    "the data were also screened for characteristics of the gis internal background and screening based on event locations and rise time . the standard script",

    "g347.3@xmath00.5 was observed by the @xmath3  pca with a pointing position that was offset by 7.8  from the nominal center of the snr to avoid contaminating flux from three nearby x - ray binaries ( 4u1708@xmath0408 , 1rxs j170849.0@xmath0400910 and gps1713@xmath0388 ) that appear close to g347.3@xmath00.5 in the sky .",
    "each of these x - ray binaries is located approximately 1@xmath29 from the pointing position , so none of them appeared within the field of view ( 1@xmath29 fwhm ) of the rxte _ pca _  observation .",
    "therefore , effects of contaminating flux from these x - ray binaries may be safely ignored .",
    "the pca is a spectrophotometer comprised of an array of five coaligned proportional counter units that are mechanically collimated to have a field of view of 1@xmath29 fwhm .",

    "g347.3@xmath00.5 falls within the sub - region of the gr denoted as r1 by those authors : for this sub - region , @xcite obtained a best - fit for the observed x - ray emission using a two component model .",
    "the first component is a raymond - smith plasma component @xcite  denoted as @xmath33  which describes the emission spectrum from a hot diffuse gas , including line emissions from several elements . using this model , with abundances frozen to solar",
    ", @xcite obtained a temperature of @xmath34 = 2.9 kev for the thermal emission from this sub - region of the gr .",
    "the second component was a simple power law ( denoted as @xmath35 ) which models the non - thermal emission from this sub - region : @xcite obtained a photon index of 1.8 for this component .",
    "lastly , the derived column density for the spectral fit was @xmath36@xmath37 = 1.8@xmath2010@xmath38 @xmath22 . to sample this background x - ray emission , two additional observations were made with the pca of fields adjacent to the field observed in the pointed observation of g347.3@xmath00.5 : we denote these fields as background region 1 and background region 2 , respectively ( see table [ obstable ] ) .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we present spectra extracted for the on - source observation and both of the background observations . we will return to a discussion of x - ray emission from the gr in section [ ironfeaturesubsection ] .",
    "after reducing all of the data , we proceeded to perform spectral - fitting analysis using the x - ray spectral - fitting package @xmath39 , first considering the @xmath3 pca data .",
    "given that the x - ray emission from g347.3@xmath00.5 is known to be almost entirely non - thermal and probably produced by electrons emitting synchrotron radiation , we used three models for non - thermal x - ray emission to fit the data : a simple power law , the @xmath5 model and the @xmath4 model .",
    "an emission feature is seen in the @xmath3  pca spectrum near 6.4 kev : to model this feature , we included a gaussian component with each of the models used in the spectral fitting ( see section [ ironfeaturesubsection ] for a more detailed discussion about this apparent feature ) . in all cases , photoelectric absorption along the line of sight",
    "was modeled using the wisconsin @xcite cross - sections and relative abundances of elements as described by @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 : earlier studies of the x - ray spectra associated with the bright rims of g347.3@xmath00.5 by @xcite and @xcite revealed that the x - ray emission from the northwestern rim , the southwestern rim and the eastern region of g347.3@xmath00.5 could all be adequately fit using a simple power law ( with a photon index of @xmath14 2 ) .",
    "these fits were made based on @xmath1 and @xmath2 observations ( extending to approximately 10 kev ) , and we performed a fit to the @xmath3 data using a power law with approximately the same index .",
    "we included a second component , a gaussian with a line width @xmath40 frozen to 0 kev , to fit the apparent emission feature seen near 6.4 kev .",
    "we discuss this emission feature in more detail in section [ ironfeaturesubsection ] .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a power law+gaussian fit to the spectrum extracted from the @xmath3 pca observations , using an photon index of 2.33 to correspond to the weighted mean value of photon indices obtained in the fits made to the northwestern rim , southwestern rim and eastern region of g347.3@xmath00.5 by @xcite .",
    "clearly , this model did not fit the data in this energy range , yielding a reduced @xmath41@xmath42 of 482 .",
    "even when the photon index was a free parameter , an acceptable fit was still not obtained : in figure [ fig4 ] , we plot the results of a power law+gaussian fit where we fit the photon index . in this figure ,",
    "the photon index is 2.61 , yielding a @xmath41@xmath42 of 1808 for 49 degrees of freedom ( a reduced @xmath41@xmath42 of 36.9 ) . while this is certainly an improvement , this model still does not fit the data .",
    "we conclude that the power law models employed by @xcite over the energy ranges sampled by @xmath1 and @xmath2 can not be extended into the @xmath3 energy range .",
    "the energy distribution of the electrons that produce the observed x - ray spectrum is therefore inconsistent with a simple power law .",
    "@xmath5 : the second model used in our analysis was @xmath5 , which describes a synchrotron spectrum from an electron distribution limited by particle escape above some energy .",
    "this model was used by @xcite to sucessfully fit the x - ray spectrum of sn 1006 , and thorough descriptions of this model are presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 model describes electrons which are shock - acclerated in a sedov blast wave encountering a constant - density medium containing a uniform magnetic field .",
    "this model also includes variations in electron acceleration efficiency with shock obliquity and post - shock radiative and adiabatic losses .    in figure [ fig5 ]",
    ", we present a fit to the @xmath3 spectrum using the @xmath5 model combined with the @xmath43 model .",
    "similar to our attempts to fit the spectrum with a @xmath35+@xmath43 model , we could not obtain an acceptable fit to the @xmath3 spectrum of g347.3@xmath00.5 using this model .",
    "for the plotted model , the corresponding ratio of @xmath41@xmath42 to degrees of freedom is 2451/48 = 51.07 .",
    "we therfore conclude that the @xmath5 model , like the @xmath35 model , does not properly describe the non - thermal x - ray emission seen from this snr .",
    "@xmath4 : the third model we considered is denoted as @xmath4 : it was described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , with the latter two papers implementing the model in their study of the maximum energies of electrons accelerated by samples of snrs in the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 model describes a synchrotron spectrum from an exponentially cut off power law distribution of electrons in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the photon spectrum is itself a cut - off power law , rolling off more slowly than an exponential in photon energies .",
    "though this model is an oversimplification , it is more realistic than a power law and it does give the maximally curved physically plausible spectrum .",
    "this spectrum can in turn be used to set limits on maximum accelerated electron energies even in remnants whose x - rays are thermal .",
    "the @xmath4 model assumes an electron energy spectrum @xmath36@xmath44(@xmath15 ) of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a normalization constant derived from the observed flux density of the region of the snr at 1 ghz , @xmath47 is defined as 2@xmath48 + 1 ( where @xmath48 is the radio spectral index ) and @xmath15@xmath16 is the maximum energy of the accelerated cosmic - ray electrons .",
    "a crucial advantage of this model ( as well as the @xmath5  model ) is that a resulting fit may be compared with two observable properties of an snr , namely its flux density at 1 ghz and @xmath48 .",
    "finally , one of the fit parameters for the @xmath4  and @xmath5  models is the cutoff frequency @xmath49 of the synchrotron spectrum of the electrons .",
    "this quantity is defined as the frequency at which the flux has dropped by a factor of 10 from a straight power law .",
    "we can express @xmath49 in a way which is quantitatively consistent with previous work @xcite as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the magnetic field strength of the snr in @xmath7 g , assuming the electrons are moving perpendicular to the magnetic field . by using the value for @xmath49 returned by @xmath4 as well as",
    "the normalization factor @xmath46 , the synchrotron spectrum of the shock - accelerated electrons can be adequately described . moreover ,",
    "an estimate for the maximum energy @xmath15@xmath16 for the shock - accelerated electrons can also be derived .    in figure 6",
    ", we present a fit to the @xmath3 spectrum using the @xmath4 model .",
    "clearly , this model gives the best - fit to the spectrum of g347.3@xmath00.5 over this energy range : the corresponding value for @xmath41@xmath42/degrees of freedom is 207.98/48 = 4.33 , which is a considerable improvement ( though still not statistically acceptable ) over the fits obtained by both the @xmath35 model and the @xmath5 model .",
    "the normalization @xmath46 for the @xmath4 component of this fit indicates that the flux density at 1 ghz for the entire snr is 6.9 @xmath27 0.2 jy ( 90% confidence limits ) .",
    "this value is marginally consistent with the weak radio emission seen from this snr , known to be dominated by a source of emission at the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 with a corresponding flux density of 4 @xmath27 1 jy @xcite .",
    "moreover , the broad field of view of the pca certainly intercepts diffuse x - ray flux from other sources besides g347.3@xmath00.5 , which leads to a corresponding increase in the value for @xmath46 returned by the fit .",
    "we also note that by using the best fit value for @xmath52@xmath16 , equation [ nucutoffeqn ] yields @xmath15@xmath16 @xmath14 68 tev ( assuming a magnetic field strength of 10 @xmath7 g ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value of @xmath15@xmath16 obtained by @xcite using a similar value for @xmath6@xmath53 with different models .",
    "based on our success in fitting the @xmath3 spectrum of g347.3@xmath00.5 with the @xmath4 model , we conclude that the energy distribution of the highest energy cosmic - ray electrons accelerated by this snr is consistent with an exponentially cut - off power law .",
    "we next applied the @xmath4 model to the x - ray spectrum of g347.3@xmath00.5 as observed by the @xmath1  pspc and the @xmath2  gis as well as the @xmath3  pca .",
    "we took advantage of the spatial resolving capabilities of the @xmath1  pspc and the @xmath2  gis in order to simultaneously fit spectra extracted from particular regions of the snr .",
    "we simultaneously fit eight different x - ray spectra : the spectra for the northwestern rim , the southwestern rim , the northeastern rim and the diffuse central emission ( with the two interior point sources omitted ) as observed by the @xmath1  pspc , the spectra for the northwestern rim , the southwestern rim and the northeastern rim as observed by the @xmath2  gis and finally the spectra for the whole snr as observed by the @xmath3  pca .",
    "two models ( each a combination of a thermal component and a non - thermal component ) were used for the joint spectral - fitting process  namely a @xmath33+@xmath4  model and an @xmath54+@xmath4 model  in order to fit both the thermal and non - thermal components respectively in the individual specta . in their study of the x - ray spectrum of g347.3@xmath00.5 based on @xmath1  pspc and @xmath2  gis data ,",
    "@xcite found no evidence for thermal emission from any portion of the snr .",
    "we revisted this issue by testing whether the joint fit to the individual spectra would be improved by the inclusion of a thermal component .",
    "both thermal models describe the emission spectrum from a hot diffuse gas , including line emission from several elements , that is in a state of collisional ionization equilibrium . both of these models have a common set of parameters : a plasma temperature @xmath34 , an abundance @xmath55 , a redshift @xmath56 and an emission measure @xmath57 .",

    "we can evaluate this expression as follows : we recall that we have assumed a distance of 6 kiloparsecs to g347.3@xmath00.5 and we note that the angular size of this snr is 65@xmath31 @xmath20 55@xmath31 @xcite , therefore the corresponding linear radius is 1.65 @xmath20 10@xmath62 cm . assuming a spherical volume for the snr with a filling factor of one - quarter ( that is , assumed only one - quarter of the total volume of the snr",
    "is filled with thermal particles that produce the observed emission ) , as well as uniform values for @xmath60@xmath44 and @xmath60@xmath37 throughout the volume , then equation [ emeqn ] yields @xmath63 we can estimate the ambient densities of hydrogen surrounding g347.3@xmath00.5 from the values obtained from the spectral fits for @xmath57 ( assuming @xmath60@xmath44 = 1.2 @xmath60@xmath37 ) .",
    "we will continue this discussion when we describe our detection of thermal x - ray emission from g347.3@xmath00.5 in section [ thermalsubsection ] .",

    "we therefore conclude that the spectral feature is not associated with g347.3@xmath00.5 and instead originates in the diffuse x - ray emission from the gr seen in projection beyond g347.3@xmath00.5 .",

    "these emission models are consistent with the models employed by @xcite , and a detailed discussion of the high energy emission from non - linear shock acceleration processes associated with snrs is given by @xcite . from our fit to the @xmath2  gis data and the tev data , we have derived estimates for @xmath15@xmath16 for the accelerated cosmic - ray electrons and magnetic field strength @xmath6 . for the depicted fit , the ratio of @xmath41@xmath42 to the degrees of freedom is 191.78/113 = 1.70 . based on this fit , we estimate a value of only 8.8@xmath9 tev for @xmath15@xmath16 of the accelerated cosmic - ray electrons and a corresponding magnetic field strength of @xmath6 = 150@xmath10 @xmath7 g .",
    "this value for @xmath15@xmath16 is sharply lower ( but still consistent ) with the upper limit derived by @xcite , while the corresponding value for @xmath6 is considerably larger than the value of 10@xmath7 g assumed by @xcite .",
    "there is also a modest amount of overlap between our range of values for @xmath6 and the the range suggested by @xcite ( 10 @xmath7 g ",
    "100 @xmath7 g ) .",
    "however , the physical plausibility of this fit may be questioned based on the value derived for the ratio of the volumes for tev emission and x - ray emission from the northwestern rim  that is , @xmath11@xmath12/@xmath11@xmath13 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , who fixed this ratio to equal unity , we allowed this ratio to vary and obtained a value of @xmath11@xmath12/@xmath11@xmath13 @xmath14 1000 , with a lower limit of 360 , assuming that the power law index is 2.1 ( derived from our from our model fits where @xmath48 = 0.55 ) and that there is no curvature to the electron spectrum .",
    "this ratio is too high to be physically acceptable , and suggests that the tev emission from the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 is not produced by inverse compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons off high energy electrons accelerated along this rim of the snr",
    ".    nonetheless , while this tev emission may not be produced by inverse compton scattering , we argue that neutral pion decay also can not produce this emission .",
    "we point out that in arguing that the tev emission is produced by neutral pion decay , @xcite assumed an extremely large ambient density ( @xmath60 @xmath14 100 @xmath61 if a distance of 6 kpc to g347.3@xmath00.5 is assumed ) for the northwestern rim of the snr .",
    "our fits to the thermal component of the x - ray emission from the northwestern rim and the central diffuse emission yield a dramatically lower ambient density ( @xmath60 @xmath14 0.05 - 0.07 @xmath61 ) and make the conclusions of @xcite seem untenable .",
    "@xcite also concluded that g347.3@xmath00.5 is expanding into an ambient interstellar medium with an extremely low density , and suggested that the snr is expanding into the evacuated wind - blown cavity created by the stellar progenitor : we agree with this finding , and suggest that while g347.3@xmath00.5 may have formed in the vicinity of dense molecular clouds , it has not yet begun to interact with these clouds .",
    "we also note that the observed tev emission is observed to be centered on the northwestern rim of the snr and _ not _  on the adjacent cloud , as assumed by @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite noted that if the flux of the gev emission from the @xmath8-ray source 3eg j1714@xmath03857 can be used to constrain the neutral pion decay spectrum fit presented by @xcite : if this source is associated with the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 , its flux must be taken into account in all spectral fits , while if the @xmath8-ray source is not associated with this rim , then the gev emission may be treated instead as upper limits on flux along this energy range .",
    "@xcite showed that the flux from the neutral pion decay spectrum fit exceeded the observed gev emission by a factor of three , therefore strongly arguing against neutral pion decay as the process responsible for the tev emission .",
    "for these reasons , we argue that the tev emission observed from the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5 is not produced by neutral pion decay .",
    "we also comment that if the ambient density is as low as inferred by our estimates , the process of non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission  as well as neutral pion decay  will be significantly suppressed . a non - thermal bremsstrahlung origin for the tev emission",
    "may also be ruled out because a spectrum generated by this process would  like the spectrum produced by neutral pion decay  exceed the observed gev emission . in conclusion , we state that none of the known high energy processes associated with snrs  inverse compton scattering , neutral pion decay and non - thermal bremsstrahlung  can adequately fit the observed tev emission from the northwestern rim . from the work of @xcite , we suspect that all models of high energy emission from snrs over broad energy ranges must take into account some curvature in the energy spectrum of accelerated electrons rather than assuming simple power laws . in such a case ,",
    "one of these emission processes may be able to adequately fit the observed tev emission from the northwestern rim of g347.3@xmath00.5  and perhaps the rims of other snrs detected at such high energies ",

    "the evidence for the association between these sources is not compelling because , based on simulations of the interactions between snrs and interstellar clouds @xcite , we expect the amount of radio emission from both the snr and the cloud to dramatically increase as a result of the interaction .",

    "the failure to detect radio emission from the hard x - ray source or the northeastern rim of the snr and a  wrap around \" morphology to the radio emission argues against an interaction taking place at that site .",
    "another reason to doubt that an interaction is taking place between g347.3@xmath00.5 and the molecular cloud is related to the ratio of emission from rotational transitions of co molecules , co(@xmath73=2@xmath741)/co(@xmath73=1@xmath740 ) , as measured at the site of the cloud .",
    "an enhanced value for this ratio ( such as a value of 1.2 or greater ) is thought to indicate that an interaction is taking place between the cloud and a shock , such as the one associated with an snr @xcite . both @xcite and @xcite found an enhanced value for this ratio for the cloud along the northeastern rim of the snr , but we suggest that in this particular case the enhanced co(@xmath73=2@xmath741)/co(@xmath73=1@xmath740 ) ratio and the low ambient density of the snr can not be reconciled , and that ( as mentioned before ) g347.3@xmath00.5 is not currently interacting with this molecular cloud . @xcite measured a value for the flux ratio co(@xmath73=2@xmath741)/co(@xmath73=1@xmath740 ) of 2.4@xmath270.9 : according to @xcite , such a flux ratio corresponds to a shock velocity of less than 5 km / sec in the cloud .",
    "the shock speed in a cloud is reduced by the square root of the ratio of the ambient densities .",
    "based on co observations @xcite , the mean density of the cloud has been estimated to be approximately 500 @xmath61 . from our spectral fits , we have inferred an average ambient density g347.3@xmath00.5 to be @xmath14 0.06 @xmath61 : from these estimates for the mean density of the cloud and ambient density around the snr , we conclude that the shock velocity outside the cloud is less than 500 km / sec . for comparison ,",
    "if we assume that the electrons and protons in g347.3@xmath00.5 are in thermal equilibrium at @xmath34 = 1.5 kev ( from our fits to the diffuse thermal emission from the snr ) , then the corresponding shock velocity is approximately 1100 km / sec .",
    "since the proton temperature is most likely much larger than the electron temperature in the case of young snrs @xcite , like g347.3@xmath00.5 , this value for the shock velocity is actually a lower limit , and therefore the shock velocity exceeds 1100 km / sec , which is in sharp disagreement with the shock velocity of @xmath75 500 km / sec derived earlier .",
    "@xcite noted that the large x - ray luminosity of ax j1714.1@xmath03912 ( 1.7 @xmath20 10@xmath76 ergs / sec at the assumed distance of 6 kpc ) made g347.3@xmath00.5 barely able to provide enough kinetic energy ( in the form of nonthermal particles ) to power this source , unless g347.3@xmath00.5 is much closer than 6 kpc or the sn explosion which created this snr had more than 10@xmath77 ergs of energy .",
