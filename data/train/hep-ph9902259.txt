    "when photons from both nuclei are added together , separate peaks appear in @xmath145 . at lhc ,",
    "the higher energies spread the distribution over a much wider rapidity range , and the double peaked structure largely disappears , except for the @xmath4 .",
    "the total perpendicular momentum spectrum is dominated by the two nuclear form factors , through the cutoff on the emitted photon @xmath147 and through the slope @xmath51 of @xmath94 .",
    "the ( quadrature ) sum of these is roughly @xmath148 , or about 45 mev / c for gold .",
    "this cutoff is a clear signature of coherent interactions , shared with @xmath149 and coherent double pomeron interactions . because of the exclusive production and small @xmath147",
    ", these events can be easily separated from background such as grazing nuclear collisions , beam gas interactions and incoherent photonuclear interactions@xcite .",
    "other authors have considered coherent double - pomeron interactions in heavy ion collisions@xcite .",
    "if reactions where the nuclei collide are excluded , the cross section is very small , and depends critically on the range of the pomeron@xcite@xcite .",
    "because the cross sections are so large , the probability of having multiple interactions in a single nucleus - nucleus encounter is nonnegligible .",
    "this can be quantified by considering the meson production probability @xmath150 for a single collision .",
    "figure  [ probability ] shows this probability for various mesons for ( a ) gold beams at rhic and ( b ) lead beams at lhc ; the probabilities reach the 1% level . for the @xmath4",
    ", we show results from two different hadronic interactions models : the woods - saxon model , eq .",
    "( [ eqhint ] ) , and also a hard sphere @xmath138 result .",
    "although the two models predict very similar overall rates , the probability is significantly affected around @xmath151 , doubling the maximum probability at lhc .",
    "this probability is high enough that , even in the absence of correlations@xcite , significant numbers of vector meson pairs should be produced .",
    "neglecting correlations , the pair production probability is @xmath152 for identical pairs and @xmath153 for nonidentical pairs .",
    "these cross section and corresponding yearly rates are tabulated in table  [ sigmapair ] .",
    "triples and higher multiples are also possible .",
    "of course , final state interactions may affect what is observed in a detector .",
    "two - photon physics is expected to be a significant activity at rhic @xcite@xcite and lhc@xcite@xcite . because the kinematics for both photonuclear interactions and two - photon collisions is dominated by the coherent coupling to the two nuclei , and consequently by the nuclear form factors , the reactions have similar kinematics .",
    "so , the specific pathway may not be determinable from the final state",
    ".    the rates for photonuclear interactions are considerably higher than for comparable two - photon reactions .",
    "for example , the @xmath6 production rate with gold beams at rhic is about 8 hz . for comparison ,",
    "the rates for @xmath154 and @xmath155@xcite are 0.13 and 0.02 hz respectively . at higher masses ,",
    "the situation is similar , and photonuclear vector meson production may overshadow two - photon production of scalar and tensor final states , complicating meson spectroscopy .",
    "it is worth noting that the photonuclear @xmath156 rate is many times larger than that expected from @xmath149 production@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the same techniques developed to study @xmath149 physics at heavy ion colliders are effective at selecting photonuclear interactions .",
    "the similarity of the two interactions can lead to some interesting opportunities .",
    "for example , when the final states are indistinguishable , interference can occur between the photonuclear and @xmath149 production channels .",
    "interference between leptonic decays of photonuclear produced vector mesons and bethe - heitler @xmath157 pairs has been studied previously@xcite ; at future heavy ion colliders , many more channels will be accessible .    despite the similarity",
    ", the different @xmath145 spectra may allow statistical separation of @xmath149 and photonuclear interactions .",
    "this is because the photon flux scales as @xmath158 , while the pomeron / meson couplings have a much weaker energy dependence .",
    "the @xmath145 distribution for photonuclear production is broader than for two - photon production .",
    "this is especially true for photon - meson interactions , where the @xmath158 photon spectrum combines with a cross section that drops with energy to form two peaks at large positive and negative rapidity , corresponding to low energy photons from the two nuclei in turn .",
    "figure [ dndycompare ] compares the two distributions for @xmath159 and for production of a hypothetical vector meson with the same mass .",
    "two vector meson models are shown : one based on the @xmath11 couplings and another with only pomeron coupling .",
    "the two are very similar at @xmath160 , but the @xmath11 model peaks about 10% higher",
    ".    it may also be possible to separate the two classes by their different impact parameter dependence .",
    "a two - photon interaction can occur at a significant distance from both nuclei , while a photonuclear interaction must occur inside or very near a nucleus .",
    "so , the two classes will have a different impact parameter dependence . in a collision",
    ", photon exchange can leave the nuclei excited in a giant dipole resonance , regardless of other activity ; the excitation probability depends on the impact parameter@xcite .",
    "this may allow us to statistically separate the two classes .    in a broader study",
    ", it will also be possible to separate the two classes by measuring how the rates vary with @xmath8 ; the meson and pomeron flux rises should be less @xmath8 dependent than photons .",
    "this study will require data with a variety of different beam species .",
    "we have calculated the rates and rapidity distribution for exclusive photonuclear production of vector mesons in heavy ion collisions , using a glauber model calculation .",
    "the lhc results involve photons with energies considerably above those currently available .",
    "although this adds to the physics interest , it also introduces some uncertainty into the rates presented here . for the @xmath2 ,",
