    "coupled oscillators present a great variety of interesting phenomena and provide models for many different areas in engineering , biology , chemistry , economy , etc .",
    "there is a considerable body of literature on coupled oscillators , see e.g.  @xcite , in particular on different network configurations without time - delay . in  @xcite a global bifurcation analysis for a network of linear coupled oscillators without delay was presented with applications in chemical processes , and in  @xcite an extension of this work was presented considering the lag among nodes as bifurcation parameter for neural networks with symmetry ; an analysis of several configurations of oscillators with smooth coupling functions is presented in  @xcite ; similar results considering patterns emerging in networks of coupled oscillators with time - delay can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in obtaining the simplest model for an n - oscillator second - order network with time - delay between oscillators ; for this purpose we shall choose a phase - locked loop ( pll ) as node , see  @xcite ; the main difference between a pll and other kinds of oscillators used frequently in the literature is that a pll can oscillate by itself and its frequency can be controlled by an external signal , see  @xcite . in order to obtain a proper mathematical model for a single node we shall take as a starting point the classical approach as presented by floyd  @xcite and kudrewicz  @xcite , and for the network we will use the model introduced by piqueira - monteiro  @xcite , but here",
    "additionally we shall compare three different models , namely , the full - phase model , the phase model and the phase - difference model .    numerical results obtained for these models are used in order to validate our analytical conclusions , especially when discussing bifurcation points , which is the main aim of our research .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : full_phase_model ] the full - phase model for an n - node fully connected time - delay network is reviewed , the focus is the symmetry of the network and to find irreducible representations , bifurcations are analyzed in each of the isotypic components . in sections  [ sec :",
    "phase_model ] and  [ sec : phase_diff_model ] a comparative analysis between the phase model and the phase - difference model is performed using the results obtained for the full - phase model , and finally conclusions and insights for future research are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in  @xcite a model for a fully connected n - node network with time - delay is presented , each node is a second - order pll oscillator , see  @xcite ; in this model the so called `` double - frequency '' term is neglected arguing that its influence is suppressed by the local dynamics in each node , see  @xcite . in what follows we will use this model but include the double - frequency term , thus we have that equation @xmath2 in  @xcite becomes @xmath3 \\quad\\quad \\dfrac{k\\mu}{n-1}\\displaystyle\\sum_{\\stackrel[j\\neq i]{j=1}{}}^n\\left[\\sin(\\phi_j(t-\\tau)-\\phi_i(t))+\\sin(\\phi_j(t-\\tau)+\\phi_i(t))\\right ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath4 . the `` double - frequency '' term is embedded in the term @xmath5 .",
    "this equation models the dynamics for the @xmath6-th oscillator in the n - node network ; we call @xmath7 @xmath8 the full - phase of the @xmath6-th oscillator where @xmath9 is the local instantaneous phase , @xmath10 represents the local frequency , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are called gains , and @xmath13 is the time - delay .",

    "here we restrict to @xmath18 to ensure existence of equilibria .",

    "a space @xmath72 is called @xmath31-invariant if @xmath73 , for all @xmath74 . when a compact group acts on a space @xmath72",
    ", we can decompose the space into @xmath31-invariant subspaces of smaller dimension .",
    "the smallest blocks for such a decomposition are said to be irreducible .",
    "when @xmath31 is finite then there is a finite number of distinct @xmath31-irreducible subspaces of @xmath72 , call these @xmath75 . define @xmath76 to be the sum of all @xmath31-irreducible subspaces @xmath77 of @xmath72 such that @xmath77 is @xmath31-isomorphic to @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79 this generates a unique decomposition of @xmath72 into the so - called _ isotypic _ components @xmath80 of @xmath72  @xcite . a representation of a group @xmath31 on a vector space @xmath72 is said to be absolutely irreducible if the only linear mapping on @xmath72 that commutes with all @xmath81 is a scalar multiple of the identity  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23-symmetry acting on @xmath82 by permuting coordinates is called the permutation representation .",
    "this has the trivial subrepresentation consisting of vectors whose coordinates are all equal .",
    "the orthogonal complement consists of those vectors whose coordinates sum to zero , and when @xmath83 , the representation on this subspace is an @xmath84-dimensional absolutely irreducible representation of @xmath23 , called the standard representation , see e.g. @xcite . in other words , @xmath82 decomposes as @xmath85 where for any subgroup @xmath86 of the action of a lie group @xmath31 on @xmath30 the fixed - point subspace of @xmath86 is given by @xmath87and @xmath88 is @xmath23-invariant and irreducible .",

    "when @xmath166 the transcendental characteristic functions in   become ordinary characteristic polynomials with two roots each .",
    "since we are interested in analyzing the influence of the time - delay between the nodes in the network it is important to know whether the system is stable or not at @xmath166 .",
    "if it is , we would like to determine , if there exists some @xmath167 such that a finite number of roots cross the imaginary axis at @xmath168 from the left to the right switching stability with @xmath169 .",

    "we start by analyzing bifurcations in @xmath139 .",
