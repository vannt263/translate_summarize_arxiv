    "cold atoms in optical lattices provide a system for realizing interacting many - body systems in essentially defect free lattices  @xcite , and have been an active area of research in recent years .",
    "the strong interest in this system is due in part to the ability to dynamically control lattice parameters at a level unavailable in more traditional condensed matter systems .",

    "absent good thermometers , and given the ability to dynamically change the density of states , it is important to understand the thermodynamics of experimentally realistic systems in order to estimate the temperature .",
    "it has been pointed out that loading sufficiently cold , non - interacting atoms into an optical lattice can lead to adiabatic cooling ,  @xcite , but the cooling available in a real system will clearly depend on and be limited by interactions .",
    "it can also depend on the ( typically harmonic ) trapping potential , which provides an additional energy in the problem , as well as on the finite size of the sample . here",
    ", we calculate the entropy of bosons in unit filled optical lattices for homogeneous and trapped cases .",
    "we provide good approximate , analytical expressions for the entropy for various cases , including finite number effects which allow for comparison of temperatures for adiabatic changes in the lattice .",
    "for translationally invariant lattices at commensurate filling , the reduced density of states associated with the gap that appears in the insulating state presents a significant limitation to the final temperature when raising the lattice @xcite .",
    "the presence of the trap , and the associated superfluid - like component at the edges can significantly increase the density of states , however , allowing for lower final temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we make the assumption of adiabatic loading and thus calculate the lowest possible final temperature achievable from a given initial temperature during the loading process .",
    "we realize that to be fully adiabatic might be experimentally challenging , however our calculations could be used to benchmark the effect of the loading on the temperature of the atomic sample .",

    "[ hom ] we focus on the translationally invariant case .",
    "we first develop analytic expression for the thermodynamic quantities in the @xmath6 limit and then we use them to calculate the final temperature of the atomic sample assuming we start with a dilute weakly interacting bec , described using the bogoliubov approximation .",

    "we compare the thermodynamic properties of this system with the ones of a translationally invariant system in the mi state , with the same number of atoms ( @xmath190 ) and same ratio @xmath191 .    as we described in the previous section , for homogeneous systems the finite @xmath1 corrections for the @xmath192 ratio in consideration",
    "are very small , and for temperatures below @xmath193 they can be neglected . on the contrary ,",
    "when the parabolic confinement is present , taking into account the kinetic and trapping energy corrections is crucial for a proper description of the low temperature properties of the system .",
    "unlike the spatially invariant case , where the lowest lying excitations in the mi phase are 1-ph excitations which have an energy cost of order @xmath0 , in the trapped case , within the parameter regime in consideration , there are always lower - lying excitations induced by atoms tunneling out from the central core and leaving holes inside it .",
    "we refer to these excitations as _ n - hole _",

    "these `` surface '' n - h excitations must be included in the trapped system because of the reservoir of empty sites surrounding the central core , which introduces an extra source of delocalization .",

    "for the parameter regime in consideration this assumption is valid for the modes close to the fermi energy , which are the relevant ones at low temperature ( ref.@xcite ) . using this box - like spectrum",
    "it is possible to show that for @xmath202 ( where the first assumption allows a semiclassical approximation ) @xmath200 is given by eq.([a ] ) . in fig.[fig5 ]",
    "the blue - dotted line corresponds to this linear solution and it can be seen that it gives a fair description of the entropy in the low temperature regime .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the slower increase in entropy as a function of temperature in the homogeneous system compared to the trapped one is a particular effect induced by interactions . in the non - interacting case the opposite behavior",
    "is observed : for an homogeneous system @xmath203 whereas for the trapped system @xmath204 so if @xmath205 then @xmath206 .",
    "here @xmath207 is the dimensionality of the system and @xmath208 the critical condensation temperature .    in a typical experiment the sample",
    "is prepared by forming a bec in a magnetic trap .",
    "therefore a good estimate of the initial entropy is given by @xcite :    @xmath209    where @xmath210 , with @xmath211^{1/3}/2\\approx 1.57 $ ] and @xmath212 the mean harmonic oscillator length ( @xmath213{\\omega_x \\omega_y \\omega_z}$ ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath214 takes into account the main corrections to the entropy due to interactions . in the above equation @xmath215 with @xmath216 the critical temperature for condensation and @xmath217 the critical temperature for the ideal trapped gas @xmath218",
    "the term proportional to @xmath219 accounts for the small shift in the critical temperature induced by interactions . for typical experimental parameters",
    "@xmath214 ranges from 0.35 to 0.4 .    if one assumes a @xmath220 atoms , @xmath221 hz and a very cool initial sample , @xmath222 , one obtains that in typical experiments the initial entropy per particle of the system is not smaller than @xmath223 .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows then that the reduction of the final temperature during the adiabatic loading induced by the trap can be significant . in turn",
    ", this suggests that the presence of the magnetic confinement is going to be crucial in the practical realization of schemes for lattice - based quantum computation .    to emphasize this point , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( top panel ) we plot the mean occupancy of some lattice sites as a function of the initial entropy per particle .",
    "it should be noted that for the number of atoms in consideration the edge of the cloud at @xmath106 is at @xmath224 . for comparison purposes",
    "we also plot @xmath92 calculated for the correspondent spatially homogeneous system .",
    "the plots shows that for the central lattice sites there is almost @xmath225 fidelity to have one atom per site for the range of initial entropies in consideration .",
    "fluctuations are only important at the edge of the cloud and if one excludes these extremal sites the fidelity in the trap case remains always higher than the fidelity in absence of the trap . in the bottom panel",
    "we also show the density profile for @xmath197 and compare it with the one at @xmath226 .",
    "it is clear in the plot that the central lattice sites remain almost with one atom per site .",
    "the considerations made here are for adiabatic changes to the lattice , and therefore represent a lower bound on the final temperature , assuming the entropy is fixed . how quickly the lattice can be changed and remain adiabatic is a separate issue , but we point out that for systems with finite number of atoms confined by an external trap there is not a sharp superfluid / insulator phase transition , which should relax the adiabaticity requirements when passing through the transition region",
    ". a proper adjustment of the harmonic confinement during the loading process could reduce the time scales required for adiabaticity to be experimentally realizable .",
    "in this paper we calculated entropy - temperature curves for interacting bosons in unit filled optical lattices and we used them to understand how adiabatic changes in the lattice depth affect the temperature of the system .    for the uniform system , we have derived analytic expressions for the thermodynamic quantities in the @xmath177 case and we used them to identify the regimes wherein adiabatically changing the lattice depth will cause heating or cooling of the atomic sample in the case of a unit filled lattice .",
    "we have shown that the heating is mainly induced by the gapped excitation spectrum characteristic of the insulator phase . by considering finite size effects and finite @xmath1 corrections",
    "we have shown that the former leads to increased the heating of the atoms , the latter tend to reduce it .",
    "finally , we have discussed the spatially inhomogeneous system confined in a parabolic potential and we have shown that the presence of the trap reduces significantly the final available temperature of the atoms due to the low - energy surface excitations always present in trapped systems .    the fact that the harmonic confinement turns out to be clearly a desirable experimental tool for reducing temperature in the lattice is an important finding which should be taken into account in the ongoing experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at using the mott insulator transition as a means to initialize a register for neutral atom quantum computation .",
