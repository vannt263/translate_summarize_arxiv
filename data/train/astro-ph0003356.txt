    "the solar wind lithium isotopic ratio , ( @xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath4 = 0.032@xmath50.004 , has recently been determined from measurements in lunar soil ( chaussidon & robert 1999 ) . as these authors point out , this value greatly exceeds the expected photospheric ratio , based on the fact that @xmath3li in the photosphere is depleted by over a factor of 100 relative to its protosolar value ( i.e. the photospheric vs. the meteoritic abundance , grevesse , noels , & sauval 1996 ) , and that this depletion , due to burning at the bottom of the convection zone ( brun , turck - chieze , & zahn 1999 ) , should lead to a much more severe depletion of @xmath0li , which burns at a lower temperature than @xmath3li .",
    "in addition , there exist observational upper limits on the photospheric ratio , ( @xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath6@xmath70.01 ( mller , peytremann , & de la reza 1975 ) and ( @xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath6@xmath70.03 ( ritzenhoff , schrter , & schmidt 1997 ) .",
    "chaussidon & robert ( 1999 ) thus suggest that the measured solar wind @xmath0li must be solar flare produced",
    ". however , they only consider @xmath0li production by spallation from c , n and o. the demonstration that solar flares can indeed account for the @xmath0li in the solar wind has very important implications on many problems in solar physics .",
    "light element production by accelerated particle interactions was treated in detail ( e.g. ramaty et al . 1997 ) . in non - solar settings , and for accelerated particles of predominantly low energy , the dominant reactions are @xmath2he(@xmath8,p)@xmath3li , @xmath2he(@xmath8,n)@xmath3be ( with @xmath3be decaying to @xmath3li ) and @xmath2he(@xmath8,x)@xmath0li ( where x stands for either a proton and a neutron , or a deuteron ) . in solar flares , however , the reaction @xmath2he(@xmath1he , p)@xmath0li is also very important ( mandzhavidze , ramaty , & kozlovsky 1997a ) , both because of its very low threshold energy and because for solar energetic particles @xmath1he/@xmath2he can be as large as 1 or even larger ( e.g. reames 1998 ) .",
    "such @xmath1he/@xmath2he enhancements are one of the main characteristics of the acceleration mechanism responsible for impulsive solar energetic particle events , as distinguished from gradual events , based on the duration of the accompanying soft x - ray emission .",
    "the @xmath1he enrichment is thought to be due to stochastic acceleration through gyroresonant wave particle interactions which preferentially accelerate the @xmath1he ( temerin & roth 1992 ; miller & vias 1993 ) . concerning the particles which interact at the sun , evidence for accelerated @xmath1he enrichment",
    "was obtained from the detection ( share & murphy 1998 ) of a gamma - ray line at 0.937 mev produced by the reaction @xmath9o(@xmath1he , p)@xmath10f@xmath11 ( mandzhavidze , ramaty , & kozlovsky 1997b ; 1999 ) . using gamma - ray data from 20 flares , mandzhavidze et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that for essentially all of these flares @xmath1he/@xmath2he can be as large as 0.1 , while for some of them values as high as 1 are possible .",
    "in addition , they showed that for the particles that interact and produce gamma rays , @xmath1he enrichments are present for both impulsive and gradual flares .",
    "thus , we can expect @xmath1he/@xmath2he@xmath120.1 for most flares that produce gamma rays and isotopes at the sun .",
    "in the present letter we carry out new calculations of li production and re - calculate ( see ramaty & simnett 1991 ) the average accelerated ion irradiation of the sun , to show that flare accelerated particle interactions produce enough @xmath0li which , combined with photospheric @xmath3li , can account for the solar wind @xmath0li/@xmath3li measured in lunar soil .",
    "we employ the nuclear code described in detail in ramaty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) which includes , in addition to the @xmath8@xmath8 reactions mentioned above , also li production from c , n and o. the cross section for the additional reaction , @xmath2he(@xmath1he , p)@xmath0li , is shown in figure  1 , together with the cross sections for the @xmath8@xmath8 reactions producing @xmath0li and @xmath3li . for the @xmath1he",
    "induced reaction we obtained the cross section for @xmath0li production in the ground state , from threshold ( 2.34 mev / nucleon ) to 8.2 mev / nucleon , by detailed balance using the cross section for the inverse exothermic reaction @xmath0li(p,@xmath1he)@xmath2he ( angulo et al .",
    "we added the contribution of the reaction for producing @xmath0li in the 3.56 mev excited state which decays to the ground state by photon emission , using data from harrison ( 1967 ) .",
    "the total cross section at 9.3 mev / nucleon is from koepke and brown ( 1977 ) , and at 18 and 20.4 mev / nucleon from halbert , van der woude , & ofallon ( 1973 ) . at higher energies we extrapolated the cross section as expected for reactions with 2 particles in the exit channel .",
    "gamma - ray production in solar flares results predominantly from thick target interactions , meaning that particles accelerated in the upper portions of coronal loops produce nuclear reactions as they slow down in the denser chromospheric region of the loops ( e.g. ramaty & murphy 1987 ) .",
    "we adopt the same model for li production .",
    "the upper panel in figure  2 shows the resultant thick target @xmath0li yields , normalized to unit incident total number of protons of energy greater than 30 mev , @xmath1330)=1 .",
    "the energy spectra of the accelerated particles are power laws in kinetic energy per nucleon , with spectral index @xmath14 ( ramaty , mandzhavidze , & kozlovsky 1996 ) .",
    "the evidence for enhanced @xmath1he/@xmath2he was mentioned above .",
    "there is also evidence that @xmath8/p could exceed the canonical 0.1 , with possible value around 0.5 ( share & murphy 1997 ; mandzhavidze et al .",
    "thus in figure  2 we show results for @xmath8/p = 0.1 and 0.5 , and @xmath1he/@xmath2he=0 , 0.1 and 1 .",
    "we see in the upper panel that the @xmath1he enrichment very significantly increases the lithium production , especially for steep spectra .",
    "that the lithium production is mainly due to @xmath8 particles and @xmath1he nuclei can be seen by comparing the six upper curves with the lowest one , for which we set the @xmath8 particle and @xmath1he abundances to zero , so that all the @xmath0li in this case is produced in c , n and o interactions .",
    "considering the flare produced isotopic ratios in the lower panel , we see that while in the absence of @xmath1he , @xmath0li/@xmath3li is at most unity , much larger ratios are possible with enhanced @xmath1he/@xmath2he .",
    "to calculate the average flare produced lithium , we estimate the average proton irradiation of the sun , @xmath15(@xmath1630mev ) measured in protons per second , where the average is taken over a solar cycle .",
    "we follow the method described by ramaty & simnett ( 1991 ) .",
    "we start with the flare size distribution measured in 0.3 to 1 mev bremsstrahlung because observations in this energy range give the most complete sample of solar flare gamma - ray emission ( see vestrand et al . 1999 ) . to minimize the effects of anisotropic electrons ( e.g. miller & ramaty 1989 ) we employ the distribution derived for flares near the solar limb ( dermer 1987 ) . for flares at heliocentric longitudes 60@xmath17 to 90@xmath17 , observed from march 1980 to february 1986 ( approximately half a solar cycle ) the size distribution , measured in number of flares per unit @xmath18 , can be approximated by @xmath19 , where 10@xmath206500 photons @xmath21 is the observed 0.3 to 1 mev bremsstrahlung fluence at earth per flare .",
    "the total number of @xmath160.3 mev emitting flares per solar cycle is obtained by integrating the above expression multiplied by a factor of 12 , where a factor of 6 takes into account the whole solar surface and a factor of 2 the other half of solar cycle .",
    "we thus obtain 375 flares , which compares well with the 175 flares listed by vestrand et al .",
    "( 1999 ) from which @xmath160.3 mev bremsstrahlung was observed with the solar maximum mission ( smm ) over almost a whole solar cycle .",
    "this latter number should be corrected for anisotropy effects , and must be multiplied by a factor of 2 since smm only observes half the solar surface .",
    "the required average irradiation is then given by @xmath22 where t is the number of seconds in 11 years and @xmath23 is the number of protons above 30 mev expressed as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "to derive this relationship , we first employ the result of murphy et al .",
    "( 1990 ) that for flares near the limb @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total nuclear deexcitation line emission fluence observed at earth .",
    "next we use the nuclear deexcitation code ( e.g. ramaty et al .",
    "1996 ) to derive @xmath2730)/@xmath26 .",
    "this ratio depends on the spectrum and composition of the accelerated particles , in particular @xmath8/p .",
    "ramaty et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have derived the distribution of power law spectral indexes from gamma - ray data , showing that for a sample of 19 flares the mean @xmath28 . for this value of @xmath14",
    "we find that @xmath2930)/@xmath26 = 1.7@xmath3010@xmath31 and 6.6@xmath3010@xmath31 protons/(nuclear deexcitation photons @xmath21 ) , for @xmath8/p=0.5 and 0.1 , respectively . by using @xmath32=4.5 and these @xmath1330)/@xmath26 to derive @xmath33 , equation  1 yields @xmath34(@xmath1630mev)=3.5@xmath3010@xmath35 and 1.4@xmath3010@xmath36 protons s@xmath37 , for @xmath8/p=0.5 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "even though a detailed treatment of the time dependent evolution of li in the solar atmosphere is beyond the scope of this paper , we now show that @xmath0li production in solar flares could indeed account for the solar wind @xmath0li/@xmath3li . to demonstrate this we assume the following : ( i ) all the flare produced @xmath0li is evacuated by the solar wind , ( ii ) the photospheric @xmath0li that is the remnant of its protosolar abundance is negligible , and ( iii ) the solar wind ( @xmath3li / h)@xmath4 is equal to the photospheric value ( @xmath3li / h)@xmath6=1.4@xmath3010@xmath38 ( grevesse et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the solar wind ( @xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath4 is then given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is plotted in figure  2 and @xmath41@xmath426@xmath3010@xmath43 s@xmath37 is the average solar wind proton flux ( dupree 1996 ) .",
    "taking @xmath44 , 0.1@xmath45@xmath8/p@xmath450.5 and 0.1@xmath45@xmath1he/@xmath2he@xmath451 , we obtain 0.007@xmath45(@xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath4@xmath450.06 .",
    "this range is consistent with the observed value of 0.032@xmath50.004 .",
    "several effects could lead to lower or higher calculated ( @xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath4 .",
    "clearly there are uncertainties in our estimate of @xmath4630 mev ) , in particular there could be a large number of smaller gamma - ray flares , which have not yet been observed , and if they had steep ion energy spectra and high @xmath1he/@xmath2he they would contribute significantly to @xmath0li production . on the other hand , some of the flare - produced @xmath0li could be mixed downward to the photosphere and lost from the solar wind .",
    "the calculated ( @xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath4 would also be lower if ( @xmath3li / h)@xmath4 were higher than ( @xmath3li / h)@xmath47 , a possibility since li has low first ionization potential , a factor that biases coronal abundances relative to those of the photosphere ( e.g. reames 1998 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the better than order of magnitude agreement between the calculated and measured ( @xmath0li/@xmath3li)@xmath4 provides good support to the possibility that the measured @xmath0li in lunar soil is indeed solar flare produced .",
    "it is of some interest to compare the average @xmath0li production , 6@xmath3010@xmath48@xmath45[@xmath15@xmath4930)@xmath50li ) ] @xmath455@xmath3010@xmath51 atoms s@xmath37 , with the contribution of the 19 large smm flares from which gamma - ray line emission was observed . using the method detailed in mandzhavidze et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , for each flare we derive @xmath14 and @xmath52(@xmath1630 ) . then using @xmath53(@xmath0li ) from figure  2 , taking into account that for 5 of the 19 flares @xmath8/p@xmath420.5 ( mandzhavidze et al .",
    "1999 ) , we obtain the flare - by - flare @xmath0li productions which yield averages over the 9 year smm observing period of 1@xmath3010@xmath48 and 7@xmath3010@xmath48 @xmath0li atoms s@xmath37 , if for all flares @xmath1he/@xmath2he=0.1 and 1 , respectively .",
    "thus , about 15% of the @xmath0li production that we derived using the flare size distribution could result from 19 of the largest flares . concerning the contributions of individual flares , as much as a few times",
    "10@xmath54 li atoms could be produced by a large flare and most of these would be @xmath0li ( mandzhavidze et al .",
    "we demonstrated that it is possible to produce enough @xmath0li by flare accelerated particles to account for the measured @xmath0li/@xmath3li in lunar soil that is thought to originate from solar wind implantation .",
    "the presence of enriched accelerated particle @xmath1he is essential for the production of sufficient @xmath0li .",
    "we note that the radioactive @xmath36al in the early solar system is thought to be produced in @xmath1he induced reactions ( lee et al .",
    "this raises the possibility that some of the meteoritic @xmath0li could also be of local early solar system origin .",
    "kotov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) claimed that flare accelerated particle interactions could account for all the photospheric lithium . if this were true , since the solar wind acceleration is not expected to significantly alter the lithium isotopic ratio , the solar wind @xmath0li/@xmath3li should exceed 0.2 ( figure  2 ) , contrary to the observed value of 0.03 .",
    "this confirms the previous result of mandzhavidze et al .",
    "( 1997a ) that production in flares does not make a significant contribution to the average photospheric lithium .",
    "but the fact that as much as 10@xmath54 li atoms are produced in large solar flares , suggests that flare produced lithium may be detected in a small area of the solar surface near the foot points of the flaring loops shortly after the time of the flare ( see livshits 1997 ) . in this connection",
    ", it is interesting to point out that ritzenhoff et al .",
    "( 1997 ) do nt rule out the presence of @xmath0li near a sunspot at a value close to their reported upper limit @xmath0li/@xmath3li@xmath70.03 , which in fact coincides with the measured solar wind value .",
    "further research in this area requires direct measurement of lithium and its isotopic ratio in the solar wind , spectroscopic measurements of @xmath0li in the photosphere , and the detection of gamma rays from small flares that would lead to a more precise determination of the proton irradiation of the sun .",
    "all of these should lead to new insights into the processes of transport and mixing in the solar atmosphere and of the acceleration of the solar wind ."
