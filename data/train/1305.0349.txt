    "the reliability of a fault - tolerant quantum computation depends on not only the choice of error correction code but also the methods used for syndrome extraction , state preparation , and error decoding .",
    "these choices can be compared at an abstract level of quantum circuits and depolarizing channels , but realistic quantum information devices will have error rates that depend on circuit elements as well as limited connectivity for applying two - qubit gates @xcite .",
    "topological codes have an advantage in that they are naturally suited to nearest - neighbor architectures @xcite .",
    "concatenated code error correction procedures require additional resources to map these circuits onto local architectures which leads to a reduced error threshold relative to the abstract model @xcite .",
    "still , these codes offer potential benefits over topological codes for systems with low - error rates and fast communication between distant qubits by ballistic transport or interaction with flying qubits .",
    "the extraction of syndromes requires the preparation and measurement of fresh ancilla states .",
    "this process is what allows us to remove the entropy from the quantum system @xcite .",
    "one question that arises is how many extra qubits should one dedicate for ancilla .",
    "consider the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code  @xcite using the shor method for syndrome extraction  @xcite based on verified cat states .",
    "each cat state contains four qubits ; six syndrome measurements are required , suggesting that between 4 and 24 ancilla qubits could be used .",
    "the proper balance of ancilla resources depends on the device details and the error rates of the physical operations . for most quantum information devices , measurement is the slowest operation .",
    "it has been shown that in a nonequiprobable error environment where z type error is dominant , the fidelity of the shor state may decreas with verification  @xcite . to avoid bottlenecks due to the measurements used to verify cat states , divincenzo and",
    "aliferis @xcite proposed a method that does not require verification of ancilla states .",
    "here we compare these methods on a model ion trap quantum computer .",
    "the ion trap architecture is a promising basis for quantum computation and have already demonstrated long coherence times and high fidelity operations .",
    "a scalable architecture has been proposed based on shuttling ions between traps @xcite and work is ongoing to implement this architecture experimentally @xcite .",
    "this framework has been the basis for a number of studies on the resource requirements for implementing large quantum algorithms @xcite and has also been considered as the elementary logical unit of hybrid schemes using photonic interconnects @xcite .",
    "while an arbitrarily well - connected ion trap layout can be envisioned , such that there is little fear of collision or backlogs , this is not realistic given current technology .",
    "the ion trap layout , for example , is a grid of narrow paths where no ion may pass by another .",
    "performing multiple two - qubit gates efficiently becomes problematic .",
    "there will be a limited number of interaction zones , and the paths to reach them will be obstructed by other qubits which adds non - trivial transport time in addition to the time required to execute gates .",
    "this introduces the issue of latency which is defined here as the total amount of time experienced by qubits after physical state preparation .",
    "latency includes qubit transport times , gate times , and idle times due to traffic in the layout .",
    "when mapping a quantum circuit to a series of device operations for a layout with limited connectivity , resources dedicated to the transport of qubit information quickly come to dominate the cost of algorithm execution  @xcite .",
    "the goal then becomes to find a schedule of qubit operations that reduces latency as much as possible , both to make operation times feasible for large algorithms and to reduce memory errors due to ever - present environmental noise .",
    "parallelization of operations is one of the most direct ways to reduce latency and is the focus of this work .",
    "one simple way to increase the parallelizability is to prepare additional ancillary qubits ahead of time in states needed by the computation . just as in classical computing , this is a trade - off between memory and latency .",
    "maximum parallelization may call for the simultaneous creation and preparation of multiple ancilla sets ( low latency ) , but this results in `` stale '' ancilla that may suffer logical errors before being used ( poor memory performance ) .",
    "both of these factors can be calculated quantitatively .",
    "total latency can be calculated given a layout , a schedule of gates , and a set of operation times ( gate time , qubit speed , measurement time , etc . ) .",
    "logical error can be characterized in terms of fidelity , or alternatively in terms of the qubit error rate .",
    "in general , it will increase with increasing latency . using these calculations",
    ", we can study the effect of additional resources on the error rate of the overall algorithm execution .",
    "the impact of ancilla preparation on overhead has been previously studied for both individual logical qubits  @xcite and large - scale quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the individual logical qubit studies done for the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code assumed an abstracted layout . although the studies did consider memory errors due to gate operation times , they did not include the additional errors due to movement latency .",
    "the large - scale study looked at ion trap layouts holding large numbers of logical qubits , and found that ancilla generation was the primary performance bottleneck .",
    "the bottleneck was removed by creating regions dedicated to ancilla preparation and recycling .",
    "our approach flows in part from these prior studies ; here , multiple ancilla blocks are assigned to individual logical qubits , and two different ancilla encodings are employed .",
    "once an ancilla block size and encoding are chosen , execution of the steane code is simulated using a software design tool .",
    "the design tool is used to include realistic latency and scheduling bottlenecks , pointing towards the most practical ancilla encoding and block size .",
    "our study focuses on a single round of steane - code quantum error correction on a model ion trap architecture as a function of ancilla encoding / decoding and ancilla resources .",
    "the steane [ [ 7,1,3 ] ] code is the best - known of the calderbank - shor - steane codes @xcite .",
    "it encodes one logical qubit into seven physical qubits .",
    "the resulting logical states @xmath0 and @xmath1 have a hamming distance of three and the code is able to detect and correct up to one physical bit - flip error and one physical phase - flip error .",
    "the steane code has been widely studied and has been shown to have a threshold in the range between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite which makes it suitable for fault - tolerant quantum error correction ( ftqec ) .",
    "the steane code has six weight - four syndrome operators .",
    "each syndrome is extracted by measuring a four - qubit cat state after interacting with the data qubits . in this study ,",
    "the steane qec process is simulated and the latency and fidelity are calculated varying numbers of shor ancilla sets from one to six .",
    "the two preparation / decoding cases are : ( 1 ) `` on - demand '' where only two sets of ancilla are prepared at any time , and ( 2 ) `` one - time , '' where all ancilla are prepared at once before the first use .",
    "these procedures are done for both shor and divincenzo - aliferis ancilla encodings .",
    "circuit diagrams for the two methods are shown in figure [ fig : circuits ] .",
    "circuits for extraction of z type syndrome measurement of the steane code using the ( a ) standard shor and ( b ) divincenzo - aliferis method . in the divincenzo - aliferis method",
    ", the cat state verification step is substituted with post - measurement decoding of the ancilla .",
    "dashed lines demarcate different sections of the circuits .",
    "also shown to the right are representations of the schedule of operations as a function of circuit sections .",
    "p = prepare , v = verify , c = couple , d = decode , m = measure .",
    "grey regions correspond to operations that are exclusively movement . ]",
    "previous ion trap studies in the literature have used a gate - level error model to calculate error correction properties . here",
    "we model our ion trap using parameters and constraints derived from the physical machine description ( pmd ) provided by the iarpa quantum computer science program  @xcite .",
    "the ion trap pmd is a collection of linear ion trapping regions joined by cross junctions see figure [ fig : topology ]",
    ". it is modeled after the ion trap charge - coupled device architecture of kielpinski , monroe , and wineland @xcite .",
    "each bus segment ( white ) section is capable of holding four ion trapping regions or `` wells . ''",
    "each well is capable of hosting up to five ions .",
    "individual ion loading wells are indicated in yellow , and interaction wells capable of executing gate or measurement operations are in green . in order to undergo a two qubit gate ( such as controlled - phase ) , the two qubits must be co - located in an interaction well .",
    "shuttling a qubit between adjacent empty wells takes 10 @xmath4s .",
    "there is an additional time cost of 10 @xmath4s to add or remove a qubit from a well that is occupied this reflects the increased experimental complexity of joining and splitting single ions from ion chains @xcite .",
    "layout for qcs ion trap pmd ]    logical errors are assumed to arise from stochastic white noise and @xmath5 noise in the control and background hamiltonians .",
    "the result is a very asymmetric error model that better reflects the dominance of gate errors over memory errors in the actual physical system .",
    "the model does not consider the heating of the ion motion due to transport .",
    "the error of two - qubit ion gates is modeled as a stochastic noise term in the two - qubit hamiltonian .",
    "table  [ tab : gaterates ] gives the latency and error rate costs of each gate type for the ion trap pmd .    in order to get the error rates in table  [ tab : gaterates ] , we approximate the real error channel derived from the stochastic noise with the closest pauli error channel .",
    "we denote the process matrix of the noisy gate by @xmath6 .",
    "the process matrix of the operation corresponding to the target ( error - free ) unitary followed by an @xmath7 gate is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the process matrices corresponding to the target unitary followed by a @xmath9 or @xmath10 gate are denoted analogously .",

    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : res ] shows the total execution time and logical error rates of steane qecc with different numbers of ancilla qubits and their scheduling scheme . in order to to reduce the errors in syndrome measurements",
    ", we assume that we run the whole qecc circuits three times and the final syndromes are determined by the majority vote .",
    "this enables us to ignore one measurement error on a set of syndrome extraction .",
    "as expected , it takes the longest to execute the whole qecc scheme when we keep only one set of ancilla in both steane - shor and steane - divincenzo - aliferis circuits . for steane - shor circuits",
    ", the number of preparation rows has the most influence on the execution time . adding four more ancilla sets with 16 qubits only reduced the time by an additional 5@xmath18 ( 2p2r @xmath19 2p6r ) , while adding more preparation rows with the same numbers of qubits reduced the execution time an additional 15 to 20@xmath18 ( 2p3r @xmath19 allp3r and 2p6r @xmath19 allp6r ) .",
    "the execution time of the steane - divincenzo - aliferis circuits are more susceptible to numbers of available ancilla qubits . adding four ancilla sets with the same number of preparation rows",
    "reduces the total time by 20@xmath18 ( 2p2r @xmath19 2p6r ) .",
    "the logical error rates are , however , almost constant regardless of number of ancilla qubits and preparation rows .",
    "we see that the errors on the measurements and the two - qubit gates dominate over the error on the idle and moving qubits .",
    "for example , the memory error rate on a qubit being idle for the total execution time of baseline steane - shor schedule would be @xmath20 .",
    "this is comparable to the error rate of a single cnot gate , and each qubit in a steane qecc encounters multiple cnot gates . we also find that ancilla decoding ( steane - divincenzo - aliferis ) yields a substantially lower error than ancilla verification ( steane - shor ) .",
    "an abstract model using steane syndrome extraction , instead of shor syndrome extraction , also showed a fidelity improvement when decoding was used instead of verification @xcite .    taken in total , the results suggest that increasing the number of simultaneous ancilla preparations has the greatest impact on qec run times , without adversely affecting the qec error rate .",
    "it also shows that the steane - divincenzo - aliferis algorithm is equivalent or superior to the steane - shor algorithm , particularly for long measurement times , given the error model presented in this paper .",
    "this is attributable to reducing ( for simultaneous preparation ) or removing ( for divincenzo - aliferis ) the ancilla verification bottleneck after preparation .",
    "we examined changes in execution time and logical error rates of steane qecc by varying the number of ancilla qubits and how they are scheduled on the ion trap architecture .",
    "we identified possible resource bottlenecks and opportunities for parallelism in preparing blocks of shor ancilla . after studying both standard shor and divincenzo - aliferis ancilla for a variety of multiple ancilla set preparations",
    ", we found that one - time ancilla preparation was superior to on - demand preparation .",
    "this is attributed to the time - intensive process of ancilla preparation driving qec latency .",
    "on - demand ancilla preparation limits the speed of the qec round to the speed of sequential ancilla preparations , particular for verification schemes like steane - shor . in comparing the steane - shor and steane - divincenzo - aliferis latencies",
    ", we found that for the case of a single ancilla set with roughly equivalent gate , measurement , and transport times , steane - shor has slightly lower latency .",
    "this is due to the ability to perform parallel operations on the verification and ancilla qubit .",
    "this also holds true for multiple ancilla sets with one - time preparation . for on - demand preparation",
    ", verification becomes a bottleneck significantly slowing down steane - shor compared to steane - divincenzo - aliferis as ancilla sets are added . when gate times are increased , steane - shor and steane - divincenzo - aliferis become effectively identical , as they both have the same number of parallel cnot operations . as measurement times",
    "are increased , steane - divincenzo - aliferis shows a much lower latency , as expected .",
    "the results presented are based on an ion trap description with optimistic error rates , but pessimistic gate and movement times .",
    "the long times required for error correction in this paper could be improved in a number of ways .",
    "for example by using ultrafast lasers , single qubit gate times as fast as 50 ps have been achieved @xcite and two - qubit gate times can in principle be considerably improved @xcite .",
    "transport in the model is limited to 1 m / s but recent experiments have shown that a transport speed of 40 - 80 m / s can be achieved while still controlling the quantum states of the ion motion @xcite .    in the future",
    ", we plan to extend this analysis to other quantum error - correcting codes including non - css type codes .",
    "we can also apply the same methods to study performance of various quantum architectures and to determine whether there exists affinity between certain devices and types of codes .",
    "the qmp method is flexible enough to handle a wide array of qubit architectures and couplings .",
    "future improvements to the qcft method will allow us to approximate error rates for circuits beyond those generated by clifford operators .",
