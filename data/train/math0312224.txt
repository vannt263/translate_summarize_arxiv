    "such a @xmath4-form is called a contact form for @xmath2 . a knot in @xmath1",

    "see , e.g. , @xcite for more about these invariants . in @xmath17 , there are two methods to calculate these invariants .",
    "first , one can project a legendrian knot @xmath18 onto the @xmath19-plane , and get an immersed knot diagram , which we call the legendrian projection .",
    "then the thurston - bennequin number is the writhe of the diagram , and the maslov index is the degree of the gauss map of the diagram .",

    "the proof of this fact is straightforward . note that , if two such knots are generically isotopic , we can change one of them to the other by a series of local moves corresponding to second type and third type reidemeister moves of its projection .",

    "there is a natural isomorphism from @xmath88 to @xmath89 by mapping the fiber thought @xmath83 to @xmath4 .",

    "[ l ] let @xmath41 be a generic knot in @xmath0 equipped with the canonical framing",
    ". then @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath52 is indeed an invariant of framed knots , i.e. , if two generic knots equipped with the canonical framing are isotopic as framed knots , then the value of their @xmath79-invariants are the equal .",
    "so , @xmath100 is also an invariant of framed knots .",
    "let @xmath101 be a framed singular knot in @xmath0 , whose only singularity is a transversal self - intersection of two strands .",
    "up to isotopy , there are two ways to resolve this singularity .",
    "let the two strands intersecting at the singularity be @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "as in @xcite , we denote by @xmath104 the resolution of @xmath101 such that the tangent vector of @xmath102 , the tangent vector of @xmath103 , and the vector from @xmath103 to @xmath102 form a position basis for @xmath0 , and denote by @xmath105 the other resolution of @xmath101 .",
    "then , @xmath106 , and , according to theorem 1.2.5(2 ) of @xcite , @xmath107 .",
    "this shows that , if two framed knots @xmath108 and @xmath109 are differed by a crossing of two transversal strands , then @xmath110 . since any homotopy between two framed knots , after a possible slight perturbation",
    ", can be decomposed into a sequence of isotopies and crossings of transversal strands , @xmath111 is indeed a homotopic invariant of framed knots .",
    "note that any framed knot of homology @xmath112 is homotopic to one of the two knots depicted in figure [ 2knots ] equipped with canonical framing .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath113 for both of these knots .",
    "thus , @xmath114 for all framed knots in @xmath0 .",
    "since the standard hyperbolic metric on @xmath27 has curvature @xmath115 , its levi - citita connection form is a positive contact form on @xmath30 . under the identification @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the corresponding contact structures on @xmath24 and @xmath34 are defined by @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "note that the latter is the restriction of @xmath21 on @xmath34 .",
    "clearly , every legendrian knot in @xmath24 is generic .",
    "so , every invariant in this paper induces an invariant of legendrian knots in @xmath24 .",
    "the thurston - bennequin number @xmath15 and the maslov index @xmath16 in @xmath25 restrict to invariants of legendrian knots in @xmath24 .",
    "their relations with the invariants defined in section [ inv - def ] are described in theorem [ contact ] .",
