    "determining the volume of metric balls in riemannian manifold , in particular unitary group , is the key to understand several coding and information theoretical quantities .",

    "is directly related to volume calculations in the manifold of interest  @xcite .",
    "estimating fundamental coding bounds such as gilbert - varshamov and hamming bounds relies on the volume of the corresponding metric ball  @xcite .    despite the need to accurately estimate the volume of metric balls in the unitary group , results in this direction are rather limited .",
    "volume estimates have been derived in  @xcite when the radius of metric ball is small . in this paper",
    ", we study the volume of a metric ball , valid for any radius , in the unitary group with chordal distance . the same problem was considered in  @xcite in the study of diversity sum bounds of unitary space - time codes , where the authors relied on numerical integrations to evaluate the volume .",
    "the starting point of the current paper is that such a numerical step may not be necessary .",
    "specifically , we show that the exact volume boils down to an integral involving a toeplitz determinant with bessel function entries .",
    "this representation gives rise to an explicit formula in the simplest case of a two - by - two unitary matrix .",
    "we then present a simple asymptotic volume formula , which is the main technical contribution of the paper .",
    "two distinct paths that led to this asymptotically exact formula have been identified : one is based on the connection of the toeplitz determinant to a hypergeometric function of matrix argument , the other directly invokes szeg s strong limit theorem on toeplitz determinants .",
    "these powerful tools of random matrix theory , albeit being subjects of intense studies for several decades , have not been fully utilized in the coding theory community .",
    "surprisingly , the limiting volume formula is already quite accurate for dimension as small as three .",
    "the reason behind the rapid convergence is examined , where it is found that the asymptotic formula approaches its limit super - exponentially fast as dimension increases due to a discovered mock - gaussian property .    as an application",
    ", we study some basic coding - theoretic questions of unitary codes via the derived asymptotic volume formula . in particular , analytical expressions for the gilbert - varshamov and the hamming bounds on codeword cardinality as well as the corresponding bounds on minimum distance of a code are derived .",
    "we also derive formulas for bounds on the code rate and its scaling law , which are key to establish existence results of unitary codes .",

    "we consider the invariant haar measure @xmath6 , defining a uniform distribution on @xmath2 . for any measurable set @xmath7 and any @xmath8 , the haar measure satisfies @xmath9 . due to the homogeneity of @xmath2 ,",
    "the characteristics of the ball  ( [ eq : ball ] ) centered at any group element , say @xmath10 , would be the same .",
    "the eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath11 takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the diagonal entries of @xmath14 are @xmath1 complex numbers @xmath15 on the unit circle .",
    "more precisely , @xmath16 takes values in a flag manifold of equivalence classes of @xmath2 modulo diagonal matrices of the form @xmath14 .",
    "the joint density of the angles @xmath17 is given by  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and the constant @xmath21 .",
    "the product @xmath22 is the jacobian of the transform  ( [ eq : evd ] ) of haar measure @xmath23 to the measure @xmath24 . in the random matrix theory literature ,",
    "the joint density  ( [ eq : j ] ) is referred to as circular unitary ensemble  @xcite and @xmath25 is the corresponding partition function .",
    "the condition on the distance measure @xmath26 in  ( [ eq : ball ] ) is equivalent to @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the ( normalized ) volume of the metric ball  ( [ eq : ball ] ) equals the following @xmath1-dimensional integral  @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 . for the maximal distance @xmath30 , the restriction @xmath27 becomes irrelevant and @xmath31 by the definition  ( [ eq : j ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we also refer  ( [ eq : v ] ) as a restricted partition function of the circular unitary ensemble .",
    "finally , we note that the volume of metric balls with other distance measures such as the geodesic distance could be similarly obtained by the analytical framework developed in section  [ sec : vol ] .",

    ", we define @xmath35 as the minimum distance between distinct codewords in @xmath2 .",
    "bounds on codeword cardinality in unitary group rely on the normalized volume of the metric ball @xmath36 formulated in  ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "in particular , the gilbert - varshamov lower bound and the hamming upper bound on the cardinality @xmath33 are related to volumes of metric ball as  @xcite @xmath37 the gilbert - varshamov bound and the hamming bound are referred to as a sphere covering bound and a sphere packing bound , respectively .",
    "the principles of the two coding bounds are different .",
    "the gilbert - varshamov bound  ( [ eq : bounds ] ) is based on a greedy but natural approach to construct a unitary code : start with any codeword and keep on adding codewords that have distance at least @xmath3 from all codewords already included until the whole space is covered .",
    "such an algorithm will terminate at @xmath38 , where @xmath39 .",
    "the argument @xmath40 in the hamming bound is related to the error correcting capability of the code , where errors made within ` hamming sphere ' of radius @xmath40 can be corrected .",
    "this generalizes the concept of hamming distance of q - ary block codes to unitary codes . by taking the union of disjoint metric balls each with @xmath40 packing radius ,",
    "we arrive at the hamming bound  ( [ eq : bounds ] ) .    another important quantity in coding theory , especially in the limit @xmath41 ,",
    "is rate of the code  @xcite @xmath42 the bounds on cardinality  ( [ eq : bounds ] ) immediately lead to bounds on code rate @xmath43 namely , for any @xmath1 there exists a code in @xmath2 with a minimum distance @xmath3 and code rate as bounded in  ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "the corresponding bounds on minimum distance @xmath3 as a function of code rate @xmath44 is obtained as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes inverse function of the volume  ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "note that besides the frobenius norm other metrics such as the spectral norm can be equally considered in the definition of minimum distance  ( [ eq : mddef ] ) , and the corresponding bounds in  ( [ eq : bounds ] ) ,  ( [ eq : rate ] ) and  ( [ eq : mindist ] ) are still valid .",
    "finally , we define the diversity sum of a unitary code  @xcite , which is closely related to the minimum distance  ( [ eq : mddef ] ) , as @xmath47 the diversity sum  ( [ eq : diverdef ] ) is an important performance measure for unitary space - time codes , where a code with large diversity sum tends to perform well at the most critical regime of low signal - to - noise ratio  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to know the largest possible value of diversity sum for a given dimension @xmath1 and cardinality @xmath33 .",

    "note that the other diversity sum bounds  ( b2 ) and  ( b3 ) proposed in  @xcite as well as the linear programming bounds  @xcite can be also analyzed by the framework developed in section  [ sec : vol ] .",
    "finally , from the diversity sum bound  ( [ eq : diversity ] ) and the relation  ( [ eq : diverdef ] ) , we reach another upper bound on minimum distance @xmath50 as discussed in  @xcite , this modified bound is tighter than the minimum distance upper bound  ( [ eq : mindist ] ) .",
