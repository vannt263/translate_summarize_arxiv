    "nowadays it is well established that the majority of nuclei possess a nonzero intrinsic electric quadrupole moment ( ieqm ) .",
    "this feature means that the charge distribution inside the nucleus deviates from the spherical symmetry . in other words ,",
    "apart from very few nuclei , the surface of the nucleus is generally not spherical in its ground state .",
    "the intrinsic quadrupole electric moments ( or equivalently the nuclear deformation ) can be deduced from two types of measurements :    the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability , @xmath2 @xcite    the static electric quadrupole moments of ground and excited states , @xmath3 @xcite    it turns out that in a number of cases , the two methods of measurement do not systematically lead to the same values .",
    "important discrepancies occur for several nuclei .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that not only different experimental techniques are used but above all , because different models can be implemented to deduce the nuclear deformation for the both cases . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is stated that deformations deduced from @xmath2 have a `` more general character '' . in other words,@xmath2-type  data",
    "reflect not only static nuclear deformation ( permanent deviation of the nuclear shape from sphericity ) , but also dynamic deformation .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 measurements are model independent and thus are generally more reliable .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that the only systematic compilation in which the deformation of the ground state is given explicitly is based on @xmath4 and has been published in ref.@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "experimental values refer to these ones .",
    "theoretical approaches to the deformation energy can be divided into two categories ; dynamic calculations to find the shape of the ground state ( or even of excited states ) and static calculations by determining the absolute minimum ( ground state ) or multiple minima ( shape isomers ) in the potential energy surface ( pes ) for a given nucleus .",
    "thus , on the one hand , we have the so - called collective models , which themselves are subdivided into two groups : the `` geometric collective model '' also called `` the collective bohr hamiltonian '' ( cbh and its variants ) and the `` algebraic model '' , well known under the name of the `` interacting boson model '' ( ibm and its variants ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , `` particle models '' consider the nucleus as a collection of interacting nucleons ( fermions ) . in practice ,",
    "the classical @xmath5-body problem can be approximately solved by the usual approximation of the mean field with eventually residual interactions . in this respect , the best  mean field",
    "is deduced after applying a variational principle in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method ( hfb ) . in this model",
    ", the determination of the potential energy surface ( pes ) of the nucleus amounts to perform constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( chfb ) calculations @xcite .",
    "we will not address very complicated methods beyond the mean field  such as the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) or the generator - coordinate - method ( gcm ) methods which are unsuitable in practice for large scale calculations.because of chfb calculations are time consumers , especially in large studies , microscopic - macroscopic method ( mic - mac ) constitutes a good alternative which , is up to now , implemented @xcite . in the present work , we use an improved variant of this method .",
    "the word improved  means that we use semi - classical method to avoid the well - known drawbacks ( spurious dependence on two mathematical parameters ) of the standard strutinsky shell correction ( see text below ) .",
    "the present study is devoted to the deformation energy , equilibrium nuclear shapes and binding energy of the ground state of the even - even cerium isotopes .",
    "there are many reasons to this choice .",
    "one of them is to re - test our previous calculations . in effect ,",
    "similar calculations have been already performed by us in the xenon , barium , and cerium region ref @xcite .",
    "however because the phenomenological mean potential varies smoothly with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we have made , in the past , a rough approximation by choosing the same set of parameters for the phenomenological mean potential , for the all treated nuclei .",
    "originally , this approximation was done only for simplifying the calculations . here ,",
    "contrarily to that study , each nucleus has its own  mean potential with a specific set of parameters . in this way it is possible to evaluate in a rigorous way the uncertainty introduced in the previous calculations .",
    "apart from this remark , there are several main other reasons which could justify this choice : ( i ) first , it should be interesting to see how the deformation energy and binding energy vary with the neutron number ( n ) for this isotopic chain .",
    "( ii ) second , the present study extends the previous calculations to all cerium isotopes up to the drip lines ( 34 versus 13 nuclei ) .",
    "( iii ) third , we also will attempt to deduce , from potential energy surface ( pes ) curves , the shape transition from spherical to axially deformed nuclei , looking for the so - called @xmath7 critical - point between u(5 ) and su(3 ) symmetry limits of the ibm @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is worth to recall briefly some information deduced from the literature for the cerium isotopes . in the past",
    ", a number of experimental as well as theoretical studies have been done for the cerium isotopes .  among the numerous studies ,",
    "we only cite some of them : in 2005 smith et al @xcite have studied excited states of @xmath8 up to spin @xmath9 deducing a probable quadrupole deformation of about @xmath10 . the deformed nucleus @xmath11 has been studied in 1985 , using the techniques of in - beam gamma -ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the corresponding data have been interpreted in terms of the cranking model by assuming a prolate deformation with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "high - spin states in @xmath14 have been also studied by a.j .",
    "kirwan et al .",
    "@xcite . they found a superdeformed band with deformation @xmath15 much more larger that the ground state deformation @xmath16 .",
    "e. michelakakis et al @xcite by evaluating @xmath17ray transitions in @xmath18 and @xmath19 conclude that in cerium isotopes ( near the beta - stable line ) the onset of nuclear deformation occur between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "`` pure '' theoretical calculations have been performed in ref.@xcite and @xcite with projected shell model ( psm ) and hartree - bogoliubov ansatz in the valence space respectively for @xmath8 and @xmath22 for low lying yrast spectra .",
    "good values of energy levels and reduced transition probabilities @xmath23 have been obtained respectively in these two papers .",
    "other approaches for the rich - neutron cerium isotopes have been made in ref.@xcite .",
    "a study of the shape transition from spherical to axially deformed nuclei in the even ce isotopes has been done in ref @xcite using the nucleon - pair approximation of the shell model .",
    "the result of a such study is that the transition has been found too rapid .",
    "relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory has been used to predict ordinary halo for @xmath24 and giant halo for @xmath25 near the neutron drip line .",
    "systematic studies about nuclear deformations and masses of the ground state can be found in ref.@xcite-@xcite  with respectively , the finite - range droplet - model ( frdm ) , hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) , hfb+5-dimensional collective quadupole hamiltonian and relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models .",
    "this method combines the so - called semi - empirical mass formula ( or liquid drop model ) with shell and pairing corrections deduced from microscopic model .",
    "thus the binding energy is given as a function of  nucleon numbers and deformation parameter @xmath26referred to as @xmath27 by mean of the usual symbols : @xmath28 @xmath29 contains the shell and pairing correction ( see text below ) .",
    "the minus sign before @xmath29 is consistent with the convention that the binding energy is defined as positive here . for the liquid drop model we take the old version of myers and swiatecki @xcite ( because of its simplicity compared to more recent formulae ) . here",
    ", there is no need to  look for very high accuracy in binding energy , because this is not the purpose of the present work .",
    "@xmath30 in eq.([ldm ] ) , we have the usual contributions of volume , surface and coulomb energies . the different constants of myers and swiatecki are given in appendix a. the shape dependence ( @xmath31 ) of the surface and coulomb energies are contained in @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "they are normalized to the unity for a spherical nuclear surface .",
    "the latter is symbolized by @xmath34 the two last terms in eq.([ldm ] ) are respectively due to the smooth part of the pairing energy and the correction of the coulomb energy to account for the diffuseness of the nucleus surface .",
    "the different constants will be fixed later . the potential energy surface ( pes without zero point energy correction )",
    "is defined as follows : @xmath35 in which@xmath36   + c_{c}z^{2}a^{-1/3}\\left [   b_{c}(\\beta ) -b_{c}(0)\\right ]   \\label{dldm}%\\ ] ] constants @xmath37 and @xmath38 are expressed by means of three other constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "for spherical shape , as said before , the normalization is expressed by : @xmath41 as it can be easily seen , the potential energy surface is related only to two macroscopic constants @xmath38 ( which depends actually on @xmath42 and @xmath40 ) and @xmath43 . to calculate microscopic shell an pairing corrections contained in @xmath44",
    ", we have to proceed in two steps .",
    "the first consists in solving the schrodinger equation and the second in deducing the shell and pairing corrections in an appropriate way , as explained in the following .",
    "we briefly present the microscopic model which is based on the schrodinger equation of the deformed independent particle model:@xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are respectively the eigenfunctions and the associated eigenvalues of nucleons .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath48 contains four contributions which are : ( i ) kinetic energy , ( ii ) central deformed mean field ,  ( iii ) spin - orbit and ( iv ) coulomb interactions .",
    "we perform analogous calculations as in nilsson model but our deformed mean potential is of woods - saxon type and therefore is `` more realistic '' .",
    "although calculations are not self consistent , they are microscopic .",
    "it is to be noted that our schrodinger equation has a form which is very close to the one of the skyrme - hartree - fock method.eq.([schro ] ) is solved by our fortran program described in details in ref @xcite and improved in two successive versions @xcite and @xcite .",
    "microscopic corrections are defined as the sum of shell and pairing corrections which themselves are calculated separately for each kind of nucleons .",
    "@xmath49 in this formula the shell correction is defined by the usual strutinsky prescription , i.e. , as the difference between the sum of the single particle energies ( which contains the shell effects ) and an averaged ( or smoothed ) sum ( which is free from shell effects ) @xmath50 energies @xmath51 are deduced from eq.([schro ] ) . in our procedure , the second sum is found by means of a semi - classical way instead a strutinsky smoothing procedure , see ref.@xcite .",
    "this avoids the well - known weakness of the standard shell correction method , namely , the dependence on two unphysical parameters which are the `` smoothing '' parameter and the order of the curvature correction .",
    "moreover , it has been clearly shown that strutinsky level density method is only an approximation of that of the semi - classical theory @xcite.the `` pure '' pairing correlation energy is defined by:@xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the usual occupation probabilities , gap and fermi energy of the bcs approximation ( the factor `` 2 '' is simply due to the kramers degeneracy ) .",
    "since the smooth part of pairing correlations is already contained in the liquid drop model , we have to add only the one due to the shell oscillations of the level density .",
    "this contribution is defined by means of a similar formula to eq.([shell correction ] ) @xmath56 where the averaged pairing is defined as @xmath57 .",
    "we use a simple bcs method to account for pairing correlations . to calculate eq ( [ shell correction ] ) and ( [ pairing correction ] )",
    "we follow the method detailed in ref.@xcite with its fortran code .",
    "the treatment of the pairing has also been explained in ref.@xcite and references quoted therein .        for each kind of particles the mean central  and the mean spin - orbit field",
    "are written as @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 contains the information on the deformation .",
    "in fact , these functions contain 9 constants : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "these quantities are taken from the `` universal '' parameters @xcite ( see appendix b ) which is an optimized set.the coulomb mean field is approximated by a uniform charge distribution inside a deformed surface .",
    "the volume conservation is therefore @xmath70with the simple assumption @xmath71      as already stated , we have chosen the parameters of myers and swiatecki ( see table [ ms2 ] ) because this set contains a reduced number of parameters with respect to more modern formulae .",
    "@xmath72    [ c]c|cccccc & @xmath73 & @xmath42 & @xmath74 & @xmath40 & @xmath75 & @xmath76 + myers and swiatecki & @xmath77 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82    all the constants are needed in the binding energy whereas only @xmath83 play a role in the potential energy surface .",
    "nuclear masses are deduced as mass excesses:@xmath84where @xmath85 is the hydrogen mass excess and @xmath86 the neutron mass excess .",
    "this makes comparisons with experimental values easiest .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite  calculations for isotopes @xmath87 showed that the equilibrium deformations ( @xmath88 ) have always been obtained for symmetric prolate shapes ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "results obtained in ref.@xcite with a similar approach for the nuclei @xmath90 corroborate this fact . for these reasons , we think that it is needless to account for the axial asymmetry in a `` pure '' static study of the equilibrium deformation",
    ". however , we have to consider prolate ( @xmath89 ) as well as oblate ( @xmath91 ) nuclear shapes . in this regard ,",
    "it is worth remembering that oblate shape given by ( @xmath92 ) is equivalent to the set ( @xmath93 )",
    ".      it could be useful to compare the importance of the different terms entering in the right hand side of eq.([deltab ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "we have drawn in fig.[contri ] for axially prolate shape , the four microscopic contributions @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 for the case of @xmath98 as functions of @xmath31 . following the cited order",
    ", we can say that the difference between the highest and lowest values ( in the interval @xmath99 $ ] ) are respectively about @xmath100 for the four corrections .",
    "thus , these variations show that the shell corrections @xmath94 , @xmath95 are more important than @xmath101 , @xmath97 and have a clear minimum at respectively @xmath102 and @xmath103 it is well known that for each kind of nucleon the shell correction is in opposite phase with respect to the pairing correction ( this means for that when @xmath94 increases with @xmath31 , @xmath104 decreases and vice versa ) .    , width=604 ]     for the nucleus @xmath98 .",
    "spherical spectroscopic notation is given for spherical deformation @xmath105the circle in dotted line indicates the area of lowest level density.,width=529 ]    contrarily to these curves , the liquid drop model is strictly increasing with @xmath31 , and its minimum occurs always at the beginning @xmath34(spherical shape ) .",
    "when all the contributions are added , the minimum of the potential energy surface of the nucleus is reached at about @xmath106 and is mainly due to the shell corrections . when @xmath31 becomes more and more , larger the contribution of the liquid drop energy becomes preponderant so that the equilibrium deformation occurs generally between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "because of the convention of the sign stated before , @xmath29 defined in eq.([binding ] ) must be negative in order to increase the binding energy of the nucleus .",
    "since the shell corrections ( for protons and neutrons ) play a major role in @xmath29 , it is naturally expected that negative ( but absolute large ) values of shell correction contribute to increase the binding energy of the nucleus . in this respect , it is well known that the shell correction is essentially determined by the distribution of single - particle levels in the vicinity of the sharp fermi level ( defined here as the midway between the last occupied level and the first empty level ) . following ref.@xcite , we can state that `` the nuclear ground state , as well as any other relatively stable state , should correspond to the lowest possible degeneracy , or , in other words , the lowest density of state near the fermi level '' .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ spe ] where the single - particle levels are drawn as function of the deformation @xmath31 ( @xmath109 being fixed at @xmath89 ) . to this end",
    "we have used the fortran code of ref.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the area where the single - particle level density is low near the fermi level ( black stars ) is indicated by a circle .",
    "thus , it is not so surprising that , it is in this region where the neutron shell correction becomes the most important , involving a minimum in the pes of the nucleus .      they are given in table ( [ t2 ] ) for prolate as well as oblate shapes ( see table legend for details ) .",
    "the minima of pes for the corresponding wells are denoted @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the deformation energy is defined as the difference @xmath112 , i.e. , the difference between the potential energy surface for a spherical shape and the one corresponding to the absolute minimum of pes .",
    "permanent deformations will be in principle characterized by large values of @xmath113 and are responsible of rotational spectra .    from this table , some remarks may be drawn:(i ) two regions of prolate deformation are found .",
    "they occur around @xmath0 and @xmath1 with maximum deformation about @xmath114 the deformation energy ( between spherical and deformed shape ) is about @xmath115 for @xmath0 and @xmath116 for @xmath1 and decreases from either side from these two nuclei.(ii ) spherical deformation occur at and near the ( magic ) numbers @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( not shown)@xmath119(iii ) the deformation energy decreases from @xmath0 ( maximum ) to @xmath117 ( minimum ) and reincreases again to @xmath1 ( maximum ) .",
    "we have found graphically that the first inflexion point occurs between @xmath120 and @xmath121 and a second inflexion point is found between @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "one can consider ( somewhat arbitrarily ) that spherical shapes occur approximately between these two limits.(iv ) the minima of prolate equilibrium deformations are , by far , always deeper compared to the ones of the oblate minima ( @xmath124  @xmath111 ) . in other words cerium isotopes prefer , by far , prolate shapes .",
    "in other words , the deformation energy increases in average with the asymmetry @xmath125 this justifies a posteriori that , in a static study of the equilibrium deformation , it is needless to account for axial asymmetry",
    ". it is worth to remember that most of nuclei of the chart have prolate shape ( see ref.@xcite).(iv ) even though the experimental deformations are known only in absolute value from @xmath126 a good agreement is obtained if one excepts the three `` nearly magic '' nuclei @xmath127 .",

    "all calculations are based on macro - micro method ( with different mean fields or different parameters ) . except the one of ref.@xcite which uses hartree - fock - bogoliubov model with gogny force.(j ) near magic number ( @xmath117 ) all calculations give spherical equilibrium deformation whereas experimental results are always slightly deformed ( even for @xmath117 ) .",
    "it seems difficult to overcome this defect with a pure static approach which neglects the role of the mass parameters.(jj ) the overall tendency of these calculations is the same except the fact that hfb calculations differ significantly from the others with higher values in some regions.(jjj ) apart from hfb calculations , theoretical values are generally quite close from each others.(jv ) our old and new calculations give very close results ( see table [ newold ] ) .",
