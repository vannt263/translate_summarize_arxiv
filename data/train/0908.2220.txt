    "the total photodisintegration cross sections of the three - body nuclei are important quantities for understanding electromagnetic processes in nuclei .",
    "the three - nucleon systems involving nucleon - deuteron radiative capture and photodisintegration of @xmath1he and @xmath1h have been investigated in experimental and theoretical works over the past decades .    in the experimental investigations ,",
    "a few measurements of triton photodisintegration have been done .",
    "more recently , including of the two- and three - body reactions , photodisintegration cross sections are measured at low energies  @xcite .",

    ", different theoretical approaches have been used in order to investigate the cross sections of the nucleon - deuteron radiative capture and photodisintegration of @xmath1he and @xmath1h from the very low energy up to 100 mev .",
    "the main aim of these theoretical studies has been the calculations of the bound state and scattering wave functions in order to be used in matrix elements of the electromagnetic current operators and ultimately testing the underlying two , three body interactions as well as currents with certain degree of complexity for the three - nucleon systems . in many theoretical treatments , by solving the three - nucleon faddeev equations based on simple finite rank forces , it is found that the interacting three - nucleon continuum is crucial for understanding the process in three - body reactions  .",
    "sandhas and his collaborators investigated many theoretical treatments of photo - effect in @xmath1h and @xmath1he three - nucleon systems by employing the realistic nucleon - nucleon forces exclusive process at  0 - 40 mev energies@xcite .",
    "for covering a larger energy range , the inclusive two- and three - body breakup cross sections have been studied by efros et al .",
    "recently , the bonn group used the modern nucleon - nucleon forces . in these works ,",
    "the current was restricted to the dominant @xmath3 multipole  @xcite or to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 multipoles  @xcite .",
    "they compared the faddeev approach and a hyperspherical harmonic expansion together with the lorentz integral transform method using av18 together with urbana ix .",
    "for the @xmath5-@xmath6 and @xmath7-@xmath6 radiative capture , a magnetic dipole m1 transition is a dominant contribution at the very low energy , in the plane wave(born)approximation  @xcite . in such investigations ,",
    "the authors employed faddeev calculations , with the inclusion of three - body forces and meson exchange current(mec ) .",
    "more recently , a very good agreement reached with the calculation of the total three - nucleon photodisintegration cross section with two quite different approaches  @xcite .",
    "rather detailed investigation of such processes has been performed by viviani et  al .",
    "recent calculation using manifestly gauge invariant currents reduced the spread  @xcite , but the result including three - body currents , @xmath8 mb , still over - predicts the cross - section by 10% .",
    "the @xmath9 potential leads to a very similar description of the cross section as the av18 interaction , considering the urbana ix three - body force for photon energies @xmath10 mev , while larger differences are found close to threshold  @xcite .    during the last few years",

    "close agreement between the available experimental data and the calculated cross section is reached .",
    "we demonstrate convergence and cutoff independence order by order in the low energy expansion .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section : theorey ]",
    ", we briefly review theoretical framework for calculating the faddeev integral equation , lagrangians for the reaction involved in our consideration , the relevant diagrams , three - body forces and cutoffs dependence . comparisons of our results with the corresponding experimental and theoretical data are given in section  [ section : comparison ] .",
    "summary and conclusions follow in section  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "in the present work we confine ourselves with the electric and magnetic dipole approximation for the transition operators . these transitions are known to make most of the total cross section at least for the low energy region where the pionless eft theory is most reliable .",
    "the photodisintegration reaction , @xmath16 , in these energies occur predominantly via electric and magnetic , specially electric - dipole transition .",
    "the triton photodisintegration cross section is then given by  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the incident photon energy and @xmath19 will be calculated from electric- and magnetic - dipole transition amplitudes .",
    "these transition amplitudes have been prepared by considering of the faddeev equation for final nd - scattering and for the initial triton bound state system to some order ( e.g. lo , nlo and n@xmath14lo ) .",
