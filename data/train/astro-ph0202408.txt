    "statistical studies of the radio emission from extra - galactic sources are entering a new era due to the availability of large sky area high - resolution radio surveys that are sensitive to mjy levels ( e.g. first , becker , white & helfand 1995 ; nvss , condon _ et al .",

    "the sample discussed here , with sdss identification for 30,000 first sources , has the advantage of more than five times more accurate optical astrometry and photometry ; it is also about 1 magnitude deeper , and utilizes 5-color , instead of 2-color , optical information .",

    "different m spectral subtypes can not be distinguished in the  vs.  diagram , and are better separated in the  vs.  diagram ( the top right panel in figure [ sdss3 ] ) , where they occupy the vertical part of the stellar locus with @xmath26 1.4 .",
    "the modeling of the stellar populations observed by sdss ( f00 ) indicates that the vast majority of these stars ( about 99% ) are on the main sequence .",
    "the lower two panels in figure [ sdss3 ] display the color - magnitude diagrams for unresolved ( left ) and resolved ( right ) sources .",
    "blue stars ( @xmath31 ) are more luminous than red stars ( @xmath41 ) and are thus observable to comparatively larger distances ( about 1 - 10 kpc for blue stars vs. 0.1 - 1 kpc for red stars ) .",
    "this , plus the steeply increasing luminosity function for the less luminous red stars gives rise to the observed bimodal stellar distribution ( for details see chen _ et al .",
    "the distribution of the  color for galaxies is very narrow ( @xmath27 0.2 fwhm ) for @xmath2716 , and widens considerably for fainter objects ; the width of the  distribution is significantly larger than the photometric errors ( 1 mag vs. @xmath30.05 mag ) , and thus represents a real spread in colors .",
    "the asymmetric distribution suggests that there are at least two galaxy populations .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in sdss color - color space has been studied by shimasaku _",
    "( 2001 ) and s01 .",
    "s01 found that galaxies show a strongly bimodal distribution of  color ( also visible in the upper left panel in figure [ sdss3 ] ) , and demonstrated that the two groups can be associated with late type ( blue group ) and early type ( red group ) galaxies .",
    "however , faint red galaxies ( which dominate the radio galaxy sample ) have poorly determined @xmath12-band magnitudes , not allowing reliable galaxy type separation on the basis of color .",
    "thus , here we separate the two classes in the  vs.  color - magnitude diagram . figure [ galcmd ] shows such diagrams for 190,000 galaxies from 100 deg@xmath0 of sky , separated according to the  criterion proposed by s01 : the upper panel shows 126,000 galaxies with @xmath3 2.22 , and the lower panel shows 64,000 galaxies with @xmath4 2.22 .",
    "figure [ galcmd ] demonstrates that an approximate separation of the two basic galaxy types is possible even when only the  and  band magnitudes are used .",
    "the mixing of the two types in the central region ( iib ) of the diagram is probably a consequence of the fact that the @xmath12-band magnitudes become less accurate at the faint end , but k correction effects may also play a role .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ galcmd ] divide the  vs.  color - magnitude diagram into several characteristic regions that are a convenient analysis tool when studying various subsamples of galaxies .",
    "galaxies brighter than = 17.5 ( close to the limit of = 17.77 for the sdss main spectroscopic galaxy sample , see strauss _",
    "_ 2002 ) display a very narrow  color distribution .",
    "we divide this magnitude range into a region including the core of the distribution ( ib ) , and the two regions bluer ( ia ) and redder ( ic ) than the core .",
    "the regions with 17.5 @xmath3 @xmath3 20 are defined by following the boundaries of the distribution of the two galaxy types : the region iia is dominated by blue galaxies , while the regions iic and iid are dominated by red galaxies .",
    "the iib region contains substantial fractions of both galaxy types .",
    "the distinction between iic and iid regions is made , somewhat arbitrarily , by extending the separation between the ib and ic regions parallel to the boundary between the iib and iic regions .",

    "the survey will cover an area of about 10,000 deg@xmath0 in the north galactic cap and a smaller area along the celestial equator , corresponding to the sky regions observed by sdss . with a source surface density of 90 deg@xmath30",

    "we define an  ab radio magnitude \" which places the radio magnitudes on the ab@xmath20 system of oke & gunn ( 1983 ) .",

    ", we choose 1.5 arcsec as the limiting distance for a match to be considered as an optical identification , and find 29,528 matches satisfying this criterion .",

    "a cutoff at 1 arcsec , with a contamination of 1.5% , is only 72% complete . the chosen cutoff results in a 85% complete sample with a contamination of 3% .",
    "the high completeness and low contamination are due to the excellent astrometric accuracy of both sdss and first . as a comparison ,",

    "these identifications represent 0.14% of all sdss sources in the analyzed region .",
    "the sample discussed here is sufficiently large to determine systematic astrometric offsets between sdss and first catalogs .",
    "the middle and bottom panels in figure [ offset ] show the astrometric offsets in each equatorial coordinate for sources brighter than = 20 and = 15 , that are least affected by measurement noise .",
    "these histograms show a 0.045 arcsec offset in right ascension and 0.120 arcsec offset in declination .",
    "systematic offsets in the sdss astrometric calibrations are thought not to exceed 0.020 - 0.030 arcsec ( pier _ et al .",
    "an additional 0.020 arcsec systematic error is present in _ photo _ v5_2 astrometry due to the use of different centroiding algorithms in different pipelines ( this will be eliminated in the next version of the pipelines and all subsequent data releases ) .",
    "thus , at most 0.050 arcsec of the offset may be attributable to systematics in the sdss astrometry , implying similar systematic errors in the first astrometry .",
    "this is an excellent agreement ; for comparison , the first and apm astrometric reference frames are offset by 0.8 arcsec ( magliochetti _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) .",
    "the equivalent gaussian widths determined from the interquartile range ( @xmath62 ) are 0.25 arcsec for unresolved sources , and 0.35 arcsec for resolved sources ( per coordinate , mean for both coordinates ) . as the multiple sdss commissioning observations of the same area show that the positions of sdss sources are reproducible to better than 0.10 arcsec rms per coordinate , the implied astrometric accuracy of the first catalog is thus 0.3 arcsec per coordinate for sources with @xmath315 .",
    "when no limit on radio flux is imposed , the first astrometric accuracy is 0.4 arcsec per coordinate .",

    "_ 2002 ) show that the sdss completeness is better than 90% for @xmath3 22 ( and approaching 99.3% for @xmath317.5 ) , the majority of unmatched first sources are probably too optically faint to be detected in sdss images .",
    "this conclusion is supported by deep imaging of a 1.2 deg@xmath0 region in hercules by waddington _",

    "the number of sources decreases faster with @xmath66 for the optically identified than for unidentified radio sources , implying that the optical identification probability is somewhat lower for the radio resolved sources .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline classifies detected sources into resolved and unresolved objects ( see [ sdssbasics ] and edr ) . in its current implementation , the photometric pipeline uses a binary classification : an object is either a  star \" ( unresolved ) or a  galaxy \" ( resolved ) .",

    "since optically identified and unidentified first sources have the same number counts slope , it is plausible that the fractions of quasars and galaxies are roughly the same for the two subsamples . to further illustrate this point , we add the counts of quasars and galaxies , multiply them by 5.6 to account for the fraction of sources that are matched ( 17.9% of first sources pass the cuts on maximum positional discrepancy , optical brightness and robust optical classification ) , and compare them to the counts of all first sources .",
    "the squares in the top panel in figure [ radiocounts ] show the scaled counts for optically identified sources , and the solid line shows the best - fit to the counts of all first sources , as discussed in  [ first ] .",

    "the bottom panel in figure [ radiocounts ] displays the distributions of the radio concentration measure @xmath52 for galaxies and quasars , where we count only the sources with @xmath65 . note that galaxies tend to have larger radio sizes ( i.e. the radio emission is resolved on scale of 5 arcsec ) which suggests that a significant fraction of their radio emission either originates _ outside _ their nucleus , or that double - lobe radio emission is resolved ( for a related discussion see section [ sbagnradio ] ) . out of 6,646",
    "matched galaxies with @xmath65 , there are 2486 ( 37% ) with @xmath54 , and 3374 ( 51% ) with @xmath70 .",

    "a control sample of 20,085 spectroscopically confirmed sdss quasars is used where appropriate .",
    "we estimate the fraction of radio quasars with stellar colors , argue that the data analyzed here support the existence of the quasar radio - dichotomy , discuss a color difference between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , and demonstrate that the slopes of optical counts vs. magnitude relations for radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars are indistinguishable for i@xmath318 .",
    "although the sdss - first quasars are dominated by low - redshift ( @xmath71 2.5 ) objects , the sample also includes some high - redshift objects . in a sample of 462 sdss quasars at redshifts greater than 3.6 , 17 objects ( 3.7% )",

    "one of the most important advantages of a radio - selected sample of quasars is that it suffers neither from dust extinction nor confusion with stars .",
    "thus , such samples can be used to estimate a fraction of quasars with stellar colors that are missed by optical surveys such as sdss , and an upper limit for the number of quasars with such a large extinction that they are undetectable at optical wavelengths .",
    "such analysis assumes that the color distribution of radio quasars is similar to the distribution for the whole sample , and , in particular , that the fraction of radio quasars with stellar colors is representative of the whole sample .",
    "although we show in section  [ qsocolors2 ] that the color distribution of radio quasars is different from that for the whole sample , the difference is sufficiently small that it does not significantly affect the conclusions of this section .",
    "the majority of optically unresolved sdss - first sources have non - stellar colors ( for a discussion of quasar colors in the sdss photometric system see richards _",

    "303 objects ( 13@xmath21% of the sample ) can not be distinguished from stars by using colors alone ; for objects with u@xmath3 21 , this fraction is 4% .",

    "the surface density of stars to a magnitude limit of @xmath3 20.5 is more than hundred times higher than the surface density of quasars , and consequently the random associations are dominated by stars .",
    "the probability of finding an unresolved sdss source with @xmath3 20.5 within 1.5 arcsec from a random position is @xmath72 ( for high galactic latitudes discussed here , see k02 ) . given the number of first sources ( 107,654 ) , the expected number of random associations is 97 , implying that 206 ( = 303 - 97 ) objects ( 11% out of 1900 - 97=1803 objects ) are true optical - radio associations with stellar colors .",
    "these results imply that the completeness of the sdss quasar spectroscopic survey is at least 89% .",
    "this fraction could be an underestimate if some of the associated sources with stellar colors are indeed stars with radio emission , as seems to be the case .",

    "we visually inspected 155 available spectra from the sample of 303 objects discussed above , and classified them into 93 stars , 6 galaxies ( compact , as determined from the imaging data ) and 56 quasars .",
    "some of these quasars have very unusual spectra ; a few examples of quasars that were targeted only because they are first sources are shown in figure [ weirdqso ] .",
    "the low fraction of quasars ( 36% ) indicates that the fraction of quasars missed by the sdss quasar spectroscopic survey due to their stellar colors may be as low as 5% ( except for redshift range of 2.53 where quasar colors mimic a stars in the sdss system , see richards _",
    "the fraction of spectroscopically confirmed stars ( 60% ) is about twice as high as the expected random association rate implying that some of these are radio stars , in agreement with k02 .",
    "we now compare the colors of first - detected quasars to those of quasars in general .",

    "we subtract this median from the  color to obtain a differential color , hereafter called color excess .",
    "the bottom panel shows the distribution of this color excess for 2,265 quasars in that redshift range by solid squares ( without error bars ) , and for 102 radio - loud quasars by circles .",
    "the  color - excess distribution for radio - loud quasars appears to be different from the distribution for the whole sample .",
    "first , the mean excess for the radio - loud subsample is redder by 0.09@xmath20.02 mag , and the median excess by 0.08@xmath20.02 mag .",
    "second , the fraction of objects with very large color excess ( @xmath75 ) is larger for the radio - loud subsample ; we find that 4.3@xmath20.4% of quasars have such extreme  colors , while this fraction is 14@xmath24% for the radio - loud quasars .",

    "the inspection of other color - color diagrams shows that the objects with extreme  color - excess are shifted along the stellar locus in the  vs.  color - color diagram .",
    "however , in the vs.  diagram they are shifted above the stellar locus , and thus are easily distinguishable from stars ( i.e. they are not missed by the sdss quasar targeting pipeline ) . in the redder bands , they are not as extreme outliers as in the bluer bands , as noted by richards _",
    "note that the wavelength dependence of this effect is qualitatively consistent with a reddening due to dust extinction ( though , of course , it may have other causes ) .",

    "thus , the @xmath40 distribution observed for sdss - first quasars , in particular its rise between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , supports the existence of the radio - dichotomy .",
    "the loud / quiet division line at @xmath104 is consistent with previous work ( e.g. urry & padovani 1995 ) , and implies that every quasar detected by first and fainter than i=18.5 is radio - loud .",
    "an unbiased estimate of the number ratio of radio - loud to radio - quiet quasars is not possible with the available data ( our estimate that 8@xmath21% of quasars are radio - loud is valid for a sample limited by optical flux , i@xmath318.5 ) .",
    "such an estimate could be determined if , for example , the data were available in the strip bounded by lines at @xmath105 and @xmath106 ; that is , if radio observations of sdss quasars that are deeper than the first survey were available for a sufficiently large number of sources .",
    "the local minimum in the @xmath40 distribution is in conflict with the suggestion by white _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) that the bimodal distribution of the radio properties may be spurious",

    "the fbqs was limited in the optical range by the poss - i e magnitude cutoff @xmath107 ( corresponding to i@xmath27 18 ) , and in the radio by the first sensitivity limit ( @xmath108 ) . since the quasar counts steeply increase with optical apparent magnitude , the sample is dominated by sources near the flux limit , and the @xmath42 distribution is heavily weighted by sources with @xmath40 close to @xmath109 .",
    "thus the fraction of radio - intermediate quasars detected by the fbqs is larger than in other surveys . to illustrate this effect , we follow white _ et al . _ , and simply determine the @xmath40 distribution for all objects in our sample with @xmath110 ( 359 ) , shown by open squares in the bottom panel in figure [ quasartvsi ] .",
    "the counts rise towards small @xmath40 without strong indication for a local minimum because the sample is biased by objects around the faint cutoff ) discussed by menou _",

    "when selected from the same redshift range , the colors of radio galaxies are similar to those of other galaxies .",
    "this point is illustrated in figure [ galccd ] ( the bottom right panel ) where we compare the redshift vs.  color distributions for all galaxies with spectra ; radio galaxies follow the same distribution as all sdss galaxies with spectra .",
    "the tendency that the colors of radio galaxies in a flux limited sample are biased towards the red end affects the classification based on observed  color .",

    "as can be discerned from the top left panel , this effect is instead a consequence of a magnitude - color correlation : more luminous red galaxies are redder than less luminous red galaxies ( the slope is 0.1 mag / mag ) .",

    "the distribution of radio galaxies in apparent magnitude vs. color space is markedly different from the overall distribution of galaxies ; in particular , the radio fraction of red galaxies is much higher than that of blue galaxies .",

    "it has been suggested that these objects may be as populous as the optically selected quasars ( fall & pei 1993 ; francis , whiting & webster 2000 ) .",
    "the data presented here suggest that the distribution of the radio - to - optical flux ratio , @xmath40 , is independent of redshift and absolute luminosity .",
    "assuming that the observed @xmath40 distribution is applicable to all quasars , it can be utilized , together with optical counts of quasars from other surveys deeper than sdss , to predict the number of quasars detected by first and not detected by sdss .",
    "this prediction can then be compared with the estimated number of first quasars without sdss counterparts .",
    "this method essentially compares the @xmath40 distribution determined for sdss - first quasars with the best guess of what the @xmath40 distribution may be for first - only quasars .",
    "the main uncertainty in this method comes from the unknown fraction of quasars in the first - only sample ; assuming the same fraction as determined for sdss - first quasars ( 17% ) , we find that there are 3.3 times as many quasars with i@xmath421.5 and @xmath316 , than quasars with i@xmath321.5 and @xmath316 . on the other hand , with the extreme assumption that _ all _ first - only sources are quasars , the upper limit on this ratio is 17 .",
    "if the predicted ratio is much smaller than these estimates , then a population of optically obscured quasars can be invoked to explain the discrepancy .",
    "we compute the expected number of first - only quasars from where @xmath158 describes the differential optical counts , and @xmath159 is the fraction of all quasars with optical magnitude i  that have @xmath3 16 .",
    "the latter is obtained from ( valid for i@xmath418.5 ) all quasars with @xmath316 and i@xmath4 18.5 are radio - loud ( @xmath73 ) , hence the index  rl \" .",
    "note that the i  integration only formally goes to infinity ; the effective range is i@xmath27 26 because most quasars have @xmath160 .",
    "the constant @xmath161 , representing the fraction of quasars with @xmath73 , and the @xmath40 distribution , @xmath162 , are determined at the bright end .",
    "the dashed line in the bottom panel in figure [ quasartvsi ] shows a best gaussian fit to the observed @xmath162 distribution ; it is centered at @xmath163 with @xmath164 .",
    "deep optical quasar counts show flattening for i20 ( assuming i ) , and follow a log(@xmath59 ) = c + 0.3 i  relation in the range 20 @xmath27 i@xmath27 22.5 ( pei 1995 ) .",
    "pei s model , which explains well the available observations for i@xmath322.5 , predicts that this relation extends to at least i24 .",
    "based on this relation , we investigate two possibilities : a ) this relation is valid for i@xmath4 20 , and b ) it applies to 20 @xmath3 i@xmath322.5 , and the quasar counts drop to zero for i@xmath4 22.5 .",
    "the second assumption is an extreme relation that maximizes the number of quasars that can be attributed to the  obscured \" population .",
    "this simple model predicts that the number of quasars with @xmath316 and i@xmath4 21.5 is 45 times as large as the number of quasars with @xmath316 and i@xmath3 21.5 for possibility a ) , and 6 times as large for possibility b ) .",
    "these values are in the same range as those implied by the counts of first - only sources , and demonstrate that there is no compelling need to invoke a significant population of anomalously optically faint quasars . however , we caution that the uncertainty of the predicted counts is large because of the unknown fraction of quasars in the first - only sample , and because quasar counts for 21.5 @xmath3 i@xmath3 26 are only weakly constrained .",
    "in particular , it can not be ruled out at a high confidence level that first - only sources include a substantial population of heavily obscured quasars ( possibly as large as the population selected by uv excess ) .",
    "two definitions of radio loudness are found in the literature .",
    "schmidt ( 1970 ) proposed the use of radio - to - optical flux ratios ( or , equivalently spectral indices , see section 2.2 ) because it appeared that they are distributed independently of optical luminosity and redshift . on the other hand , peacock ,",
    "miller & longair ( 1986 ) proposed that the radio luminosity should be used to quantify the radio - loudness .",
    "the choice of a radio - loudness measure has important physical implications : the radio - to - optical flux ratio is a proper quantity for analysis if the radio and optical emissions are correlated ; on the other hand , if the radio emission is independent of optical emission , then the radio luminosity is the quantity of interest .",
    "here we compare both definitions for objects with redshifts from the sdss spectra , and find that they produce similar radio - loud / radio - quiet classifications .",
    "this similarity is a consequence of strong selection effects in flux - limited samples .",
    "figure [ quasarrvsm ] displays the absolute radio magnitude , @xmath165 , vs. the radio - to - optical flux ratio , @xmath40 , for the 1,154 quasars detected by first .",
    "we compute @xmath40 using eq .",
    "[ rmt ] , and @xmath165 from where is the specific radio luminosity , and @xmath166 w hz@xmath57 is the specific luminosity of a source whose specific flux is 3631 jy at a distance of 10 pc .",
    "we assumed a radio spectral index @xmath167 , and for consistency with stern _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) adopted @xmath168 = 50 km s@xmath57 mpc@xmath57 , and a @xmath169 , @xmath170 universe in computing the luminosity distance , @xmath171 . as evident , @xmath40 and @xmath165",
    "are well correlated .",
    "furthermore , the separations between the radio - loud and radio - quiet objects suggested by other workers ( @xmath40 1 and @xmath172 h@xmath173 w hz@xmath57 , corresponding to @xmath174 ) appear qualitatively consistent with each other ( the two classifications are the same for 88% of the objects ) .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that a dimensionless quantity that measures the shape of sed , @xmath42 , is so well correlated with the ( dimensional ) radio power , @xmath175 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 is practically independent of redshift , while @xmath175 is a strong function of redshift at constant apparent magnitude . in principle",
    ", such a correlation could be a consequence of a physical relationship between optical and radio emission ; for example , the luminosity of main - sequence stars is correlated with the shape of the optical sed .",
    "however , we find instead that this correlation is due to several selection effects caused by the quasar redshift distribution and very different slopes of the optical and radio number counts ( 0.87 vs. 0.14 , respectively ) , as follows .    for a sample following a number count relation @xmath176 ,",
    "90% of the sample is within @xmath177 mag from the faint cutoff .",
    "thus , 90% of the sdss - first sample is within 1 mag of the optical faint cutoff , and within 7 mag of the radio faint cutoff .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath40 is @xmath178 , where @xmath17916 is the radio faint limit , and @xmath180 is the optical bright limit . since 90% of the sources are within 1 mag of the faint optical limit ( 19 ) ,",
    "only 10% of the sample can have @xmath181 , as observed .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath40 is @xmath182 , where @xmath18319 is the optical faint limit , and @xmath184 is the radio bright limit .",
    "a negligible number of sources are brighter than @xmath185 , and thus practically no sources have @xmath186 .    given @xmath40 , the variance in @xmath165 ( the vertical width of the displayed correlation ; @xmath117 1.5 mag ) reflects the variances in i  and the distance modulus ( @xmath187 ) .",
    "the latter dominates the scatter in @xmath165 because the scatter in i  is small due to the steep optical counts .",
    "the scatter in the distance modulus is determined by the distribution of redshifts ; the distribution of distance moduli has a median of 44.5 mag , and an equivalent gaussian width of 1.4 mag .",
    "the upper limit is a consequence of the upper limit on redshift , and the lower limit is due to the fast increase of the number of quasars per unit redshift interval with redshift .",
    "this narrow distribution of distance moduli explains the observed upper ( bright ) and lower ( faint ) limits on @xmath165 for a given @xmath40 .",
    "the slope of the observed correlation , @xmath188 , simply reflects the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath34 .",
    "we conclude that the difference in the slopes of the radio and optical number count relations , together with the observed redshift distribution , is responsible for the apparent correlation between @xmath165 and @xmath40 , and there is no intrinsic correlation .    due to this selection effect ,",
    "the observed bimodal distribution of @xmath42 maps into a _ biased _ bimodal distribution of @xmath175 .",
    "an unbiased distribution of @xmath175 can not be determined with the sample discussed here .",
    "in particular , a distribution of data points in @xmath175 vs. redshift plane ( analogous to figure [ mredshiftquasar ] ) has a strong bias in @xmath42 that depends on both quantities ( only sources with @xmath189 $ ] are sampled , where @xmath190 is the optical faint flux limit ) . for the same reason , the radio luminosity distributions for galaxies ( section [ orgalaxies ] ) and quasars from sdss - first sample can not be directly compared due to significantly different redshift ranges over which they are sampled .",
    "a proper determination of the radio luminosity function requires identification and redshift determination for _ all _ first sources brighter than some radio flux limit , as discussed by e.g. willot _ et al . _",
