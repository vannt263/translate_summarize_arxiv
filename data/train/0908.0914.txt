    "further , the negative branch , where @xmath7 , was found to give rise to solitary patterns having cusps or infinite slopes . the focusing branch and the defocusing branch represent two different models , each leading to a different physical structure",
    ". many powerful methods were applied to construct the exact solutions for eq.([eq1.1 ] ) , such as adomain method @xcite , homotopy perturbation method @xcite , exp - function method @xcite , variational iteration method @xcite , variational method @xcite . in @xcite , wazwaz studied a generalized forms of the eq.([eq1.1 ] ) , that is @xmath8 equations and defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 are constants .",

    "@xcite further extended eq.([eq1.2 ] ) to be a more general form @xmath11 and using some direct ansatze , some abundant new compacton solutions , solitary wave solutions and periodic wave solutions of eq.([eq1.3 ] ) were obtained . by using some transformations ,",

    "we give the phase portrait of the travelling wave system and use maple to show the graphs of the orbits connecting with the saddle points for our purpose . in section 3 , we state the main results which are implicit expressions of the kink - like and antikink - like wave solutions . in section 4 , we give the proof of the main results .",
