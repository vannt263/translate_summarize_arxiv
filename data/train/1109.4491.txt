    "extremely sensitive interferometric measurements are implied in several frontier experiments . for instance , large baseline gravitational wave detectors presently surpass the limit of @xmath1   hz@xmath2 in relative displacement spectral noise  @xcite .",
    "an improvement of more than one order of magnitude is planned for their advanced versions  @xcite , and a sensitivity of @xmath3  m/@xmath4 is envisaged in the khz range for possible future massive , cryogenic detectors  @xcite . on the small scale ,",
    "very low - noise background is also obtained in small scale quantum opto - mechanics experiments  @xcite .    with such extreme requirements ,",
    "critical limits are imposed by several noise sources associated with the interferometer optical components  @xcite , and a crucial role is played in particular by the high - reflection coating .",
    "for instance , brownian thermal noise of the dielectric layers is the most stringent foreseen limiting factor in the @xmath5khz range for the next generation of gravitational wave detectors .",
    "another important phenomenon is the photothermal dynamic effect : an ( even small ) fraction of the light impinging on a mirror is absorbed and heats it , causing a local temperature change and , through thermal expansion , a deformation of the mirror surface .",
    "a fundamental limit to the interferometer sensitivity is therefore produced by the shot noise of the absorbed radiation , and such limit can be worse in the case of excess of laser - power fluctuations .",
    "this effect , together with other dissipative phenomena such as photoelastic and brownian noise , has been studied theoretically by braginsky _",
    "_ @xcite and cerdonio _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in the case of a gaussian beam impinging on a half - infinite homogeneous mirror .    in spite of being an annoying noise source ,",
    "photothermal dynamic displacement can be exploited , using controlled laser power variations , for measuring the thermo - mechanical parameters of the mirror .",
    "this possibility is particularly important to investigate the characteristics of the coating .",
    "thin film parameters are generally different from those of the bulk .",
    "moreover , they depend on the film morphology , and finally on the techniques used for deposition .",
    "a photothermal analysis gives therefore useful information for understanding the general behavior of the coating and selecting the optimal fabrication procedure . at this purpose , it is important to analyze in particular the low - losses coating and substrates of the kind used in interferometers .",
    "dynamic photothermal effects were observed in a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity , probably for the first time , by an _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "they describe an hysteretic behavior in the cavity transmission when the laser is rapidly scanned , and use it to estimate the mirror absorption .",
    "a more detailed spectral analysis exploiting an amplitude modulated laser source is reported by de rosa _ _ et al.__@xcite , who verify the theoretical prediction of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite concerning the photothermal expansion of the mirror substrate .",
    "the study is extended in ref .",
    "@xcite , where on one hand the dependence of the photothermal response on the beam waist , foreseen in ref .",
    "@xcite , is verified ; on the other side , a deviation from the above theoretical expression is observed at low frequencies ( @xmath6  hz ) due to the limited mirror size , and at high frequencies ( @xmath7  hz ) due to the coating .",
    "the effect of the coating is also shown by black _ _ et al.__@xcite , who apply a gold film on the dielectric coated mirror to enhance the absorption at the expenses of the cavity finesse .",
    "their dielectric film is composed of alternate layers of sio@xmath8 and tio@xmath8 , and their results are in agreement with a simple heuristic model approximating the coating as an homogeneous layer .    in view of their possible use in the future gravitational wave detectors ,",
    "it is important to check the photothermal effect also on substrates of different materials ( particularly interesting are sapphire and silicon ) and at cryogenic temperature .",
    "such conditions , explored by the pioneering work of the tama group@xcite , would greatly improve the sensitivity ( at the expenses of evident technical complications ) .    in the present work we describe a detailed study of photothermal dynamic effect in a high - finesse cavity , where the mirror coating is very close to those conceived for gravitational wave detectors .",
    "our attention is indeed particularly focused on the behavior of the dielectric films , but we also check the effect on a silicon substrate .",
    "our investigation is performed both at room and at cryogenic temperature , and a theoretical model is developed in order to extract the most reliable information from the experimental data .",
    "the photothermal expansion is ruled by the thermal diffusion equation and the equation of elasticity .",
    "the mirror surface displacement is then read with a weighted average that , in the case of a gaussian beam , can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the surface normal displacement , @xmath11 are the transverse coordinates of the mirror surface , @xmath12 is the beam radius measured in correspondence of a power drop by @xmath13 from its central value .",
    "the solution of the problem in the case of an half - infinite homogeneous mirror , heated and interrogated by a gaussian beam partially absorbed on the mirror surface , is calculated by braginsky , gorodetsky and vyatchanin  @xcite ( bgv ) .",

    "one further thermo - optical phenomenon that must be considered is the thermo - refractive effect : heating changes the optical length of the coating layers , thus modifying the phase of the reflected field and therefore the position of the effective reflection plane with respect to the physical position of the mirror surface .",
    "we remark that an increased optical length gives a longer effective cavity ( while the thermal expansion brings to a shorter physical cavity ) , therefore the thermo - refractive effect has in general an opposite sign with respect to photothermal expansion .",

    "so far we have only considered surface absorption .",

    "moreover , the absorption is in general different in the two materials composing the coating .",
    "the exact solution of the field within the coating can be calculated using a characteristic matrix formalism @xcite . for a high - reflectivity coating",

    "the optical cavity is made with a ofc ( oxygen free copper ) spacer , a corning 7980 fused silica @xcite concave mirror ( 50  mm radius ) as input mirror and a flat , silicon rear mirror .",

    "the cavity optical length is 10.7  mm , the beam waist on the flat mirror is 0.083  mm and the corresponding beam size on the input surface is 0.094  mm .",

    "the rear mirror has a similar coating , with 34 layers ( 5.3  @xmath91 m ) and a lower transmission ( @xmath92 ppm ) .",

    "we have further reduced the apertures to few mm , with aluminum foil . as a consequence , the mirrors ` see ' the room temperature through couples of holes ( on the spacer and the shield ) , under a small solid angle .",
    "the experimental setup for the measurement of the photothermal response is sketched in fig .",
    "( [ setup ] ) .",
    "the light source is a cw nd : yag laser operating at 1064  nm .",
    "after a 40  db optical isolator , the laser radiation is split into two beams . on the first one ( probe beam ) , a resonant electro - optic modulator ( eom1 ) provides phase modulation at 13.3  mhz with a depth of about 1  rad used for the pound - drever - hall  @xcite ( pdh ) detection scheme .",
    "the probe beam is then frequency shifted by means of two acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) .",
    "we use respectively the + 1 and -1 diffracted orders of the aoms , so that the total frequency displacement corresponds to the difference of the aom frequencies and can be tuned by several mhz around zero .",
    "the intensity of the second beam ( pump beam ) is controlled by an electro - optic modulator ( eom2 ) followed by a polarizing beam splitter .",
    "both beams are sent to the second part of the apparatus by means of single - mode , polarization maintaining optical fibers .",
    "part of the pump is then detected by a photodiode ( pd2 ) for monitoring its amplitude modulation , while the probe is sent through a second optical isolator ( o.i .",
    "the two beams are overlapped with orthogonal polarizations in a polarizing beam - splitter and sent to the optical cavity . the reflected probe beam , on its back path ,",
    "is deviated by the input polarizer of the o.i.1 and collected by a photodiode ( pd1 ) for the pdh detection .",
    "the pump , slightly detuned with respect to the cavity resonance , is used as excitation beam in the thermo - optical response measurements .",
    "such frequency splitting between pump and probe allows to eliminate any spurious interference and reduce the cross - talk between them in the photo - detection . a quarter - wave plate before the cryostat allows to compensate cavity birefringence observed at low temperature and probably due to stress on the mirrors generated by differential contractions .",
    "the laser is weakly locked on the cavity using the pdh signal while the pump beam is amplitude modulated at different frequencies .",
    "the extraction of the photothermal response is obtained from the same pdh signal , that is acquired by a lock - in amplifier which discriminates the signal component synchronous with the modulation .",
    "the depth and phase of the intracavity power modulation is calculated from the signal of pd2 , which is also acquired and de - modulated by the lock - in amplifier , by taking into account the mode matching and the cavity coupling factor .",
    "the latter is inferred from the depth of the dip in the reflected beam when scanning on the resonance , and it is consistent with the independent measurements of cavity finesse and input mirror transmission .",
    "the pdh signal is calibrated in a separate run , stopping the pump beam and modulating the frequency of the laser through its internal piezoelectric crystal , with a depth smaller than the fabry - perot cavity linewidth .",
    "the usual lock - in acquisition and phase - sensitive detection is applied to the pdh signal .",
    "the frequency modulation rate had been previously measured by observing the sidebands at 13.3  mhz with a second , high - finesse optical cavity .",
    "the calibration procedure , performed varying the modulation frequency , allows also to correct the data for the servo loop .",
    "the locking bandwidth is of the order of 1  khz .",
    "typical values of the optical parameters are : a mode - matching of 80@xmath90 ; a finesse of 25000 ( linewidth @xmath95  khz ) ; an intracavity optical power @xmath84 equal to 7000 times the input pump power @xmath96  mw .",
    "the input probe beam power is approximately 0.2  mw .",
    "the photothermal response to intensity modulation of the intracavity field has been investigated both at room and cryogenic temperatures in the 10  hz  @xmath0  100  khz frequency range .",
    "the measured signal is reported in terms of changes of the optical path divided by the amplitude of the modulation in the intracavity power , giving a response in m / w .",
    "previous experiments @xcite have shown that , at low frequencies ( below @xmath5100  hz ) , the photothermal expansion is determined by the substrate contribution . in agreement with the theory of homogeneous mirrors , the curve can be roughly divided into two regions , separated by the characteristic angular frequency @xmath97 which depends on the thermal properties of the mirrors material .",
    "well above @xmath97 , the surface displacement is expected to decrease as the inverse of the frequency while , well below @xmath97 , it tends to a constant value which determines the absorption coefficient . on the other hand , at higher frequencies ( above @xmath5100  hz ) , the coating contribution to the total thermal expansion , in particular through the filter function , becomes relevant and the observed behavior differs substantially from the substrate @xmath98 frequency dependence . at even higher frequencies ,",
    "also the thermo - refractive effect becomes important ( in the following , we will use the term ` photothermal response ' for the overall effect , including the thermo - refractive component ) . an accurate data analysis through eq .",
    "( [ xfinal ] ) and the related expressions in appendix a allows us to to measure the effective thermal properties of the ta@xmath8o@xmath77/sio@xmath8 dielectric layers .",

    "the mechanical unbalance parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( see eq .",
    "( [ b39a ] ) ) are both close to unit and depend on the young modulus ( @xmath101 ) and the poisson factor ( @xmath19 ) of substrate and coating .",
    "we have taken the values of @xmath101 and @xmath19 from the literature ( they are reported in tables i and ii ) , including the experimental uncertainty for the coating , and a spread due to the dependence on the direction with respect to the crystal axes for si , since we have no information on their orientation in the mirror .",
    "the calculated parameters are @xmath102 and @xmath103 for the silica mirror ; @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the silicon mirror .",
    "the uncertainty in the mechanical parameters gives a small spread in the fitted parameters ( below the statistical error given by the fit ) , that we have included in their quoted uncertainty in table ii .",
    "the absorption coefficients of the two mirrors are kept as different parameters even if the two coatings are very similar ( their slightly different thickness is not expected to have a great influence on the absorption ) , since they have been provided in different batches and we have no precise information on the post - coating annealing procedure that can be different for the two mirrors .",

    "( [ fig2]b ) , where the phase data are also compared with a curve obtained form eq .",
    "( [ xbrg ] ) , thus neglecting the filter function contribution ( dashed curve ) . in this case , the disagreement between theory and experiment is relevant even at low frequencies and would lead to unreliable estimations of both the substrate and coating parameters . the phase of the response is sensitive also to the thermo - refractive effect , which seems negligible if one just consider its amplitude .",

    "we remark however than the quoted uncertainty is reliable for comparing the two mirror , but the estimate of the overall absorption is conditioned by the evaluation of the intracavity power that is hardly very accurate .",
    "the measurements have been repeated at low temperature , with the cavity spacer at @xmath113  k. the results are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) , together with the fitting functions , and the derived parameters are reported in table ii ( second column ) . around this temperature ,",
    "the photothermal response is dominated by the fused silica substrate at all frequencies .",
    "we remark that , at low frequencies , the phase curves reported in fig .",
    "( [ fig2]b ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig3]b ) clearly show that the photothermal response at room and cryogenic temperature are @xmath114 out of phase .",
    "this is due to the sign change in the fused silica expansion coefficient , which becomes negative below @xmath115  k. the effect of the coating filter function on the photothermal response phase is even more important than at room temperature , as evidenced in fig .",
    "( [ fig3]b ) .    for what concerns",
    "the silicon substrate , on one hand the silicon thermal diffusion length becomes larger than the mirror size for frequencies below few khz , thus invalidating our theoretical model ( the temperature of the silicon substrate could be considered as homogeneous , instantaneously determined by the heat absorption and the conduction through the copper spacer ) ; on the other hand , its thermal expansion coefficient becomes so low that it can be completely neglected .",
    "some figures justifying this assumption are reported in table  i.    concerning the thermal parameters of the silica substrate , we remark that expansion coefficient and capacitance have a strong dependence on temperature . since the real temperature of the mirrors",
    "is also determined by their thermal contact with the copper spacer , we have kept it as free parameters in the fit , using the known temperature dependence of @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( reported in the caption of table  i ) .",
    "the derived temperature of the mirrors is indeed @xmath118  k , giving for bulk silica @xmath119  k@xmath120 and @xmath121  j / kg  k.    the mechanical parameters ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath19 ) are kept at their room temperature values ( their weak temperature dependence is negligible in our work ) .",
    "we have verified that their uncertainty has negligible effects on all the fitted parameters .",
    "the contribution of the coating on silicon is taken into account , imposing @xmath122 in the relevant equations as justified by the silicon thermal parameters reported in table  i. the ratio between the absorption coefficients of the two mirrors is fixed at the value found at room temperature ( i.e. , @xmath123 ) .",
    "the @xmath124 uncertainty in this ratio adds a small error to some fitted parameters ( well below the corresponding statistical errors form the fit ) , that is included in the uncertainties quoted in table  ii .",
    "the absorption in the silica mirror results to be lower than at room temperature .",
    "however , we remark again that the quoted uncertainty in the absorption coefficients only reflects the statistical error , while absolute intracavity power calibrations ( giving additional systematic uncertainty ) are different between runs at room and cryogenic temperature due to the necessary re - alignment .",
    "the thermo - refractive effect at cryogenic temperature is too small to allow a reliable independent estimate of both @xmath108 and @xmath109 from our data .",
    "yet , it can not be completely neglected .",
    "therefore , we have left @xmath108 as free parameter and used the expression @xmath109 of eq .",
