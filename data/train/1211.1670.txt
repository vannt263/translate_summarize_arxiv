    "one of the major challenges in modern cosmology is identifying the nature of the sources responsible for reionising the universe .",
    "the gunn - peterson trough in the spectra of high - redshift quasars indicates that the igm was highly ionised at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the integrated thomson ( electron ) scattering optical depth to the surface of last scattering , @xmath8 , suggests that reionisation was well underway by @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it remains uncertain which sources transformed the igm into its highly ionised state .",
    "the most likely candidates are stars in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the contribution of galaxies to reionisation depends critically on the star formation history in the universe , the abundance of reionising sources , the clumping factor of the igm and the fraction of ionising photons that escapes into the igm , the so - called escape fraction .",
    "high - redshift surveys that are probing the star formation rate of galaxies at @xmath10 show that an escape fraction of more than @xmath11 is needed for the observed galaxy population to produce enough photons to keep the universe ionised @xcite .",
    "although there is some evidence for a redshift evolution of the escape fraction , such high escape fractions are not observed in the local universe @xcite and at higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "all the massive galaxies targeted by observations have average escape fractions less than 20% , although samples are small . with this escape fraction ,",
    "the ionising emissivity of the observed galaxy population is insufficient to maintain reionisation .",
    "however , the bulk of the star formation rate at these high redshifts likely arises in galaxies below the detection limit of current observational facilities @xcite .",
    "if the escape fraction evolves with redshift , these galaxies could provide the majority of photons for reionisation @xcite .",
    "numerical studies @xcite find escape fractions between @xmath12 , with possible redshift or mass dependence . in part",
    "the large differences between studies may be caused by numerical issues , because the radiative transfer simulations are computationally challenging , making approximations necessary . however , most studies targeted only a few objects and different studies focussed on different mass galaxies at different redshifts , making comparison difficult . in simulations of idealised , isolated galaxies @xcite found the main constraint on the escape fraction to be the dense gas in the star - forming regions , which provides an explanation for the large spread in escape fractions reported in previous studies .",
    "in addition , they found that the escape fraction can vary over several orders of magnitude over the lifetime of the galaxy , making it necessary to determine the contribution of galaxies to reionisation not only sampling the mass function , but also over a wide range of redshifts .    in this letter we present results on the escape fraction and ionising emissivity from a large statistical sample of proto - galaxies in a high - resolution cosmological , hydrodynamical simulation . in combination with the derived clumping factor of the igm in the simulated volume",
    "we assess self - consistently the contribution of stars in galaxies to cosmic reionisation .",
    "in the standard cold dark matter paradigm , at the relevant redshifts for reionisation most ionising radiation is produced by stars in proto - galaxies forming in dark matter haloes of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we compute the ionising photon production and escape fraction in proto - galaxies in this mass range using the _ first billion years _ ( fiby ) simulation suite ( khochfar et al . in prep . ;",
    "dalla vecchia et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the simulation we use contains @xmath14 dark matter and gas particles in a comoving volume of 4 mpc on the side , with a gas - particle mass of 1250 @xmath15 . at redshift 6",

    "we use a modified version of the _ owls _ code @xcite .",
    "star formation follows a pressure law @xcite , where we assume population ( pop ) iii stars form at metallicities @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 ) and pop ii stars at higher metallicities .",
    "supernova feedback is modelled by injecting thermal energy that is efficiently converted into kinetic energy without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily @xcite .",
    "feedback from reionisation is modelled as a uniform uv - background following @xcite by switching from collisional to photo - ionisation equilibrium cooling tables .",
    "gas above a density threshold of @xmath18 is modelled to shield against ionising radiation @xcite .",
    "we assume that reionisation takes place within the bounds set by wmap @xcite , starting around redshift @xmath19 and ending around redshift @xmath20 .",
    "this is consistent with the computations of the ionising emissivity from proto - galaxies that we present in this letter .",
    "we will show that between redshift @xmath19 and @xmath20 the proto - galaxies in the simulation produce enough ionising photons to reionise the computational volume .",
    "we have extracted all haloes from this simulation that contain at least 1 star , 1000 dark matter particles and 100 gas particles for post - processing with radiative transfer simulations .",
    "this results in more than 11000 haloes between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we determine the escape fraction with an updated version of the simplex radiative transfer code @xcite , computing the absorption of the ionising radiation by both hydrogen and helium atoms in 10 frequency bins until the photons reach the virial radius of the halo .",
    "we will discuss these simulations in more detail in a forthcoming paper ( paardekooper et al . in prep ) .",
    "the luminosity and spectra of the star particles are computed from stellar synthesis models for both pop iii @xcite and pop ii @xcite stars .",
    "combined with the escape fraction , we obtain the number of ionising photons that every proto - galaxy in our simulation contributes to cosmic reionisation .",
    "to first order the reionisation process can be modelled by equating the number of photons produced per baryon to the number of recombinations in the ionised igm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the volume fraction of ionised hydrogen , @xmath23 is then given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total number of ionising photons available for reionisation per second per comoving mpc , @xmath26 is the current mean number density of hydrogen in the igm , @xmath27 is the recombination coefficient of hydrogen , which is a function of the igm temperature @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the clumping factor of the gas in the igm and @xmath30 is the redshift .",

    "we find a redshift - dependent clumping factor between 1.5 and 6.5 , consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "we compute the thomson optical depth , which is the quantity measured by the wmap satellite , by integrating @xmath23 over all redshifts : @xmath32 with @xmath33 the cross section for thomson scattering and @xmath34 the speed of light .",

    "[ fig_fesc ] we show the average escape fraction as function of redshift for proto - galaxies in haloes of different masses .",
    "the average escape fraction rises with time , but proto - galaxies inside a certain mass halo at the same redshift may have very different escape fractions , for example due to a different formation history or environment , which causes the large standard deviation in the mean . due to",
    "the efficiency of stellar feedback in clearing away the gas from the dense sites of star formation , the escape fraction in @xmath2 haloes is higher than in the @xmath3 haloes .",
    "proto - galaxies in haloes with masses above @xmath35 have , at all redshifts , significantly lower escape fractions than their counterparts in lower mass haloes , due to their larger and denser gas content .",
    "haloes with masses below @xmath3 dominate the ionising photon budget at redshifts higher than 10 , due to their high escape fractions and high abundance .",
    "after redshift 10 , the ionising emissivity of the proto - galaxies in these haloes drops as a result of suppression of star formation by the uniform uv - background .",
    "the background heating only suppresses star formation in haloes that do not contain enough dense gas to shield against the radiation .",
    "this counteracts the effect of the high escape fraction , since ionising radiation is mainly produced by massive , young stars and suppression of star formation results in little or no ionising radiation being produced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_q ] ) .",

    "the integrated thomson scattering optical depth that we find in our model is @xmath42 , which is well within the error bars from the wmap measurement @xcite .",
    "this shows that the reionisation history we find is consistent with the two main observational constraints of reionisation , the absorption features in high - redshift quasars and the thomson optical depth as observed by wmap .",
    "the contribution of pop iii stars to reionisation is negligible in our simulations .",
    "although these sources produce copious amounts of ionising photons @xcite , they are short - lived and not abundant enough to contribute significantly to reionisation .",
    "the contribution of pop iii stars to the total photon budget is exceeded by metal - enriched pop ii stars at redshifts below 15 .",

    "we determine the flux that the nircam survey would receive from the proto - galaxies in our simulation by computing the spectra of the pop ii and pop iii stars for radiation with energy below the ionisation energy of hydrogen . in fig .",

    "if we rescale the flux limits according to @xmath58 , exposure times of @xmath59 are necessary to observe these sources .",

    "scattering off interstellar neutral gas could make the line observable even through a fully neutral igm @xcite .",
    "the flux in the @xmath60 line is always lower than the @xmath5 flux .",
    "it is therefore most likely that the sources of reionisation will be observed in the @xmath5 or ly-@xmath6 line .",
    "we have presented high - resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy formation , from which we calculated the ionising photon production and escape fraction of a large statistical sample of galaxies . from these simulations we computed the contribution of proto - galaxies to cosmic reionisation in a self - consistent way .",
    "our main findings are :    * reionisation is primarily driven by proto - galaxies in dark - matter haloes with masses between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which have very high escape fractions , because supernova feedback efficiently acts to clear away gas from the sites of star formation .",
    "* star formation in these haloes is suppressed by uv - feedback , these proto - galaxies therefore only contribute to reionisation when the part of the universe they live in is still neutral . * after reionisation the universe is kept ionised by massive galaxies with lower escape fractions , that start appearing more frequently . *",

    "radiative feedback is capable of evacuating gas from haloes with @xmath67 @xcite , thereby suppressing further star formation in the halo .",
    "we find that supernova feedback has the same effect , albeit with a short delay .",
    "since the time it takes for the dense , cold gas in the halo to be converted into stars ( @xmath68 ) is much larger than the lifetime of the massive stars that end their lives as supernova ( @xmath69 for pair - instability supernovae ) , this delay will not affect our results significantly .",
    "we model reionisation with a uniform uv - background , disregarding the contribution from local sources .",
    "we could therefore be underestimating the suppression of star formation in haloes that are not able to shield against the ionising radiation .",
    "this likely occurs in haloes with masses @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "since this will only affect proto - galaxies in a region of the universe that has already been ionised , this will not change our conclusions .",
    "however , it could delay the completion of reionisation due to suppression of clustered low - mass sources and reduce the number of photons available for reionisation . assuming all star formation in haloes with @xmath71",
    "is suppressed after reionisation brings the cumulative number of ionising photons per baryon at redshift 6 in our simulation close to the observed value @xcite .",
    "the resolution in our simulation is around 6 physical pc at redshift 15 , which is high enough to resolve regular and giant molecular clouds at the sites of star formation .",
    "however , we do not resolve the birth cloud of the stellar population , which would lower the escape fraction .",
    "since this equally applies to all haloes in the volume , it does not affect our conclusion on the mass range that contributes most photons to reionisation .",
    "the effect of a lower escape fraction can be estimated by scaling the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig_nionbaryon ] accordingly .",
    "the volume of our simulation is 4 mpc , which could possibly bias our results .",
    "the initial conditions for the cosmological simulation were chosen to avoid biased regions with high @xmath72 peaks .",
    "this is reflected in the mass function of dark matter haloes in our volume , which is in agreement with the average of the sheth - tormen mass function @xcite .",
    "although we can not accurately sample the high - mass end of the halo mass function , the strong mass - dependence we find for the escape fraction indicates that the contribution from these rare high - mass sources is small .",
    "our results show that reionisation is initially a local process driven by the appearance of many low - mass haloes which do not cluster strongly and ionise their neighbourhood until h@xmath73ii regions overlap and cover larger cosmic volumes .",
