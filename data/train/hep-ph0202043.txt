    "the neutrino experiment results @xcite have a natural interpretation in terms of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this phenomenon is violating the individual lepton flavour number , and raises an interesting possibility of observing processes with charged - lepton flavour violation , like @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5-@xmath6 conversion in nuclei , rare @xmath7 decays etc .",
    "unfortunately , due to smallness of the neutrino masses , the predicted branching ratios for these processes are so tiny that they are completely unobservable , e.g. br@xmath8 .    in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model ,",
    "however , the situation may be quite different .",
    "in addition to the sm mechanism , new sources of lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) can be generated by non - diagonal soft supersymmetry breaking slepton mass terms . even if the off - diagonal slepton mass terms",
    "are assumed to vanish at tree level to avoid the supersymmetric flavour - changing problem , they can be induced radiatively @xcite in the framework of a seesaw mechanism by the right - handed heavy neutrinos . in such a case",
    "a substantial @xmath9 mixing leads to  @xcite large @xmath10 and @xmath11 mixings . as a result",
    ", the rates for rare processes , such as @xmath12 , can be substantially enhanced . for nearly degenerate sleptons ,",
    "however , these contributions are suppressed through the supergim mechanism by @xmath13 with the mass difference @xmath14 and the average mass @xmath15 of the sleptons .",
    "once superpartners are discovered , it will also be possible to probe lepton flavour violation directly in their production and decay processes @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that sneutrino or charged slepton pair production at future @xmath2 ( and/or @xmath16 ) colliders may provide a more powerful tool to search for supersymmetric lepton flavour violation ( slfv ) than rare decay processes @xcite .",
    "however , sneutrinos and charged sleptons may not only be directly pair - produced in @xmath2 collisions , but can also be decay products of other supersymmetric particles , like charginos and neutralinos , decaying via cascades .",
    "we find that off - diagonal chargino pair - production , overlooked earlier , can make a significant contribution to the slfv signal @xcite .",
    "a flavor - violating signal is generated by the production of real sleptons , followed by their oscillation into a different flavored slepton , and subsequent decay to a lepton .",
    "for example , at @xmath2 colliders events with @xmath17 can be expected .",
    "searching for such signals has several advantages : first these processes are at tree level while rare decays are generated by loop corrections .",
    "second , the slfv processes in decays of sleptons are suppressed only as @xmath18 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the slepton decay width , as compared to the @xmath13 for rare decays .",
    "since @xmath20 is typically of the order @xmath21@xmath22 , one may expect spectacular signals for possible discovery in future @xmath2 , @xmath23 or @xmath24 collider experiments .",
    "last , but not least , the sm background with two or more leptons with different flavours is quite small .    at @xmath2 linear colliders",
    "the slfv signals can be looked for in decays of sleptons which are produced in pairs , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "these processes have been discussed in detail , showing that they may be competitive to rare decay processes in searches for slfv signals @xcite .    however ,",
    "if the chargino @xmath27 is not much heavier , as is the case in a substantial region of the mssm parameter space , then off - diagonal chargino or neutralino pair production @xmath28 , @xmath29 can take place for the linear collider cm energy @xmath30 .",
    "the heavier chargino and/or neutralino can decay via the slfv chain , @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 escapes detection .",
    "the signature therefore would be the same as in slepton pair production , _",
    "i.e. _ eq.([p3 - 18slfvsig ] ) , depending on hadronic or leptonic @xmath34 decay mode . as a result ,",
    "the processes ( [ p3 - 18charlfv ] ) and ( [ p3 - 18neulfv ] ) provide a new source for the signal in addition to those discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "to illustrate the role of charginos for the slfv process at an @xmath2 linear collider , such as the proposed tesla  @xcite , we consider the signal and background rates for two representative points in the mssm parameter space .",
    "these points are given in terms of msugra scenarios defined by : @xmath35 chosen for detailed case studies at the ecfa / desy linear collider workshop . here",
    "the masses and @xmath36 are in gev , and standard notation is used .",
    "the corresponding masses of chargino , neutralino and slepton states relevant for slfv processes at @xmath37 and 800 gev , along with some branching ratios , can be found in @xcite .    to be more specific ,",
    "we take a pure 2 - 3 intergeneration mixing between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , generated by a near - maximal mixing angle @xmath40 , and ignore any mixings with @xmath41 .",
    "the scalar neutrino mass matrix @xmath42 , restricted to the 2 - 3 generation subspace , can be written in the fermion mass - diagonal basis as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the physical masses of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively . in the following",
    "we take the mixing angle @xmath40 and @xmath48 ) . as a result",
    ", the signature of slfv in @xmath49 production would be one muon and three taus plus missing energy .",
    "such a signal might be extremely difficult to extract from background with four taus or with two muons and two taus for realistic tau identification efficiencies .    for the case rr1",
    ", however , the lightest chargino has a large branching ratio for hadronic decays .",
    "therefore in our analyses we consider only their hadronic decay modes . given the mass spectrum , the off - diagonal @xmath50 pair is the only possibility for the slfv signal in chargino production at @xmath37 gev .",
    "the slepton flavour violation can occur in the heavier chargino @xmath51 cascade decay chain as shown + [ s1 ]   @xmath52 ,   @xmath53 ,   @xmath54 + [ s2 ]   @xmath52 ,   @xmath55 ,   @xmath56 + followed by @xmath57 .",
    "there is another sequence with the charges reversed .",
    "the other process for the same final state , which was discussed in  @xcite , is the following + [ s3 ]   @xmath58 ,   @xmath59 ,   @xmath60 + where @xmath61 . in [ s1 ] and",
    "[ s2 ] the slepton flavour violating decay occurs in two ways leading to the the same final state so that eventually the signal rate gets doubled .",
    "the background may originate from the flavour - conserving susy processes + [ b1 ]   @xmath62 ,   @xmath63 ,   @xmath64 + [ b2 ]   @xmath62 ,   @xmath65 ,   @xmath66 + [ b3 ]   @xmath67 ,   @xmath68 ,   @xmath69 + [ b4 ]   @xmath70 ,   @xmath71 ,   @xmath72 ,   @xmath73 + in which the @xmath5 comes from @xmath74 decay after the @xmath75 events are produced , and from an important sm background + [ b5 ]   @xmath76 + with semileptonic top decays if two quark jets are allowed to overlap . at 800 gev",
    "additional signal and background channels open @xcite .    with the set of kinematical cuts to ehnance the signal processes ( listed in @xcite ) , in fig.[p3 - 18fig ]",
    "the contour lines are plotted for the significance @xmath77 , where n and b is the number of signal and background events respectively for a given luminosity .",

    "the background is more important reducing the sensitivity to the slfv signal .",
