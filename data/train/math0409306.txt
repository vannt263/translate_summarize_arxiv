    "we construct the riemann ",
    "hilbert correspondence associated to perturbative renormalization , in the form of a classification of flat equisingular bundles in terms of representations of the `` motivic galois group '' @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , we start by considering the scattering formula @xmath5 proved in @xcite , which expresses the counterterms through the residues of graphs .",
    "we re - express this formula in terms of the time ordered exponential of physicists ( also known as expansional in mathematical terminology ) .",
    "the expression in expansional form can be recognized as solution of a differential system .",
    "this identifies a class of connections naturally associated to the differential of the regularized quantum field theory viewed as a function of the complexified dimension .",
    "the physics input that the counterterms are independent of the additional choice of a unit of mass translates , in geometric terms , into the notion of equisingularity for these connections .",
    "thus , the geometric problem consists of the classification of _  equisingular \" _ @xmath4-valued flat connections on the total space @xmath6 of a principal @xmath1-bundle over an infinitesimal punctured disk @xmath7 .",
    "an equisingular connection is a @xmath1-invariant @xmath4-valued connection , singular on the fiber over zero , and satisfying the following property : the equivalence class of the singularity of the pullback of the connection by a section of the principal @xmath1-bundle only depends on the value of the section at the origin .",

    "first , there is kreimer s hopf algebra of rooted trees @xcite , which is adapted to the specific physical theory by decorations of the rooted trees .",
    "there is then the connes  kreimer hopf algebra of feynman graphs , which is dependent on the physical theory by construction , but which does not require decorations .",

    "when using in this frame the dimensional regularization technique of qft , all divergences disappear and one obtains a finite theory , which only depends upon the choice of a local trivialization for the principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath6 .",
    "the coefficients of the universal singular frame , written out in the expansional form , are the same that appear in the local index formula of connes  moscovici @xcite .",
    "in particular , they are rational numbers .",
    "this means that we can view equisingular flat connections on finite dimensional vector bundles as endowed with arithmetic structure .",
    "we show that they can be organized into a tannakian category with a natural fiber functor to the category of vector spaces , over any field of characteristic zero .",
    "the tannakian category obtained this way is equivalent to the category of finite dimensional representations of the affine group scheme @xmath0 , which is uniquely determined by this property .",

    "the natural appearance of the `` motivic galois group '' @xmath0 in the context of renormalization confirms a suggestion made by cartier in @xcite , that in the connes  kreimer theory of perturbative renormalization one should find a hidden `` cosmic galois group '' closely related in structure to the grothendieck ",

    "here we are dealing with the galois group dictated by renormalization and the renormalization group appears as a canonical one parameter subgroup @xmath23 .",
