    "decay constants of mesons provide essential information about the qcd interaction between quark and antiquark .",
    "they are the lowest moments of the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( das ) for the quark and antiquark inside the meson . among various theoretical approaches to predict these fundamental constants of mesons , the light - front quark model  ( lfqm ) based on the framework of light - front dynamics ( lfd )",
    "@xcite has become a very useful phenomenological tool to study various electroweak properties of mesons .",
    "owing to the rational energy - momentum dispersion relation , lfd has distinct features compared to other forms of hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "in particular , the feature that the vacuum fluctuations are suppressed in lfd can be regarded as advantageous in hadron phenomenology .",
    "however , one should also realize that the success of lfd in hadron physics can not be realized unless the treacherous points in lfd such as the zero - mode contributions in the hadron form factors and the singularities associated with the rational energy - momentum relation are well taken care of with proper methods .",
    "for instance , the zero - mode complication in the matrix element has been noticed for the electroweak form factors involving a spin-0 and spin-1 particles as well as the vector meson decay constant  @xcite . unlike the electroweak form factor described by a three - point function involving an external probe ,",
    "the meson decay amplitude is described by a two - point function and may be regarded as one of the simplest possible physical observables .",
    "it is interesting that this apparently simple amplitude bears abundant fundamental information on the qcd vacuum dynamics and chiral symmetry . to discuss the nature of the lf zero - mode in the meson decay amplitude",
    ", we may denote the total lf longitudinal momentum of the meson , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the individual quark and antiquark lf longitudinal momenta , respectively .",
    "similarly , the lf energy @xmath3 is shared by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 . the lf energy integration is done typically by using the cauchy s theorem for a contour integration . for the lf energy integration of the two - point function to compute the meson decay amplitude , one may pick up a lf energy pole , e.g. either @xmath7_{\\rm on}$ ] ( i.e. on shell value of @xmath4 ) from the quark propagator or @xmath8_{\\rm on}$ ] from the antiquark propagator .",
    "however , it is crucial to note that the poles move to infinity ( or fly away in the complex plane ) as the lf longitudinal momentum , either @xmath1 or @xmath2 , goes to zero .",
    "unless the contribution from the pole flown into infinity vanishes , it must be kept in computing the physical observable . if such contribution exists , since one of the constituents of the meson carries the entire momentum @xmath9 of the meson , the other constituent carries the zero lf longitudinal momentum and thus can be regarded as the zero - mode quantum fluctuation linked to the vacuum .",
    "it is important to capture the vacuum effect for the consistency with the chiral symmetry properties of the strong interactions . with this link",
    ", the zero - mode contribution in the meson decay process can be considered effectively as the effect of vacuum fluctuation consistent with the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions . in this respect ,",
    "the zero - mode issue of the vector meson decay constant in lfd is highly non - trivial and deserves careful analyses .",
    "it is a common practice to utilize an exactly solvable manifestly covariant model to check the existence ( or absence ) of the zero - mode and substitute the radial and spin - orbit wave functions of the exactly solvable model with the more phenomenologically accessible model wave functions that can be provided by lfqm .",
    "indeed , we found  @xcite that the existence or absence of the zero mode may depend on the model , especially on the form of vector meson vertex operator , while jaus  @xcite claimed that there exists zero - mode contribution even for the case of the plus component of the weak current @xmath10 .",
    "the purpose of this work is not only to clarify this zero - mode issue in the prediction of the decay constant from lfqm but also to discuss this topic in relation to the vacuum fluctuation consistent with the chiral symmetry of qcd . to further clarify the zero - mode issue",
    ", we analyze the two - particle das and examine a fundamental constraint anticipated from the lfqm  @xcite : i.e. symmetric quark - antiquark das for the equal quark and antiquark bound state mesons such as @xmath11 .",
    "as we shall show in this work , the vector meson decay constant including the nonvanishing zero mode claimed by jaus  @xcite and subsequently advocated by other authors  @xcite does not satisfy this anticipated constraint .",
    "we also note that the two equivalent decay constants obtained from the plus component of the currents with the longitudinal polarization @xmath12 and the perpendicular components of the currents with the transverse polarization @xmath13 are related to the twist-2 and twist-3 two - particle das of a vector meson according to the classification of ball and braun  @xcite , respectively . with this aim , we extend our previous analysis  @xcite to encompass the more phenomenologically accessible realistic lfqm  @xcite and discuss a self - consistent covariant description of the vector meson decay constant in view of the link between qcd and lfqm .",
    "more detailed analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the decay constant @xmath14 of a vector meson with the four - momentum @xmath15 and the mass @xmath16 as a @xmath17 bound state is defined by the matrix element of the vector current    [ eq:1 ] 0||q^q|v(p , h)= f m ^_h , where @xmath18 is the polarization vector of a vector meson . in the manifestly covariant bethe - salpeter model , the matrix element @xmath19 is given in the one - loop approximation as a momentum integral [ eq:2 ] j^_h = n_c h_v , where @xmath20 denotes the number of colors and @xmath21 . in order to regularize the covariant loop in @xmath22 dimensions , we use @xmath23 for the @xmath17 bound - state vertex function , where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constant parameters .",
    "although we use this particular dipole form of the hadronic vertex for our explicit analysis of covariant amplitude , the essential features of our discussion linking the zero - mode quantum fluctuation to the vacuum consistent with the chiral symmetry of qcd in corresponding lfd are independent of the specific form taken for the regularization of the amplitude .",
    "the manifestly covariant result @xmath27 is given by  @xcite . the meson vertex operator @xmath28 in the trace term is given by @xmath29 .",
    "while the dirac coupling @xmath30 is intrinsic to the vector meson vertex , the model - dependence of a vector meson is implemented through the factor @xmath31 . for the explicit comparison between the manifestly covariant calculation and the lf calculation , we analyze @xmath28 with a constant @xmath31 factor ,",
    "i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "performing the lf energy @xmath33 integration of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , we get the lf bethe - salpeter ( lfbs ) model of @xmath34 as [ eq:14 ] [ j^_h]_lfbs = ^1_0 d^2*k * _ ( x,*k * _ ) tr , where @xmath35 $ ] and @xmath36/x   + ( { \\bf k}^{2}_\\perp + m^2_2)/(1-x)$ ] .",
    "this result is obtained by closing the contour in the lower half of the complex @xmath33 plane and picking up the residue at @xmath37 in the region @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) .",
    "to obtain the decay constant , we use two different combinations of the currents and the polarization vectors , i.e. ( 1 ) plus component of the currents with the longitudinal polarization ( @xmath40 ) and ( 2 ) perpendicular components of the currents with the transverse polarization ( @xmath41 ) . for the purpose of analyzing zero - mode contribution to the decay constant ,",
    "we denote the decay constant as @xmath42 ( meaning the valence contribution to the decay constant ) when the matrix element @xmath34 is obtained for @xmath37 in the region of @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath42 is different from the manifestly covariant result @xmath27 , this difference @xmath44 corresponds to the zero - mode contribution @xmath45 to the full solution @xmath46 .",
    "the necessary prescription to identify zero - mode operator corresponding to @xmath47 and the effective inclusion of the zero - mode operator in the valence region is explicitly given in  @xcite .",
    "both decay constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 obtained from @xmath50 and @xmath51 receive the zero - mode contributions due to the singular @xmath47 ( or equivalently @xmath52 ) term in the trace in the limit of @xmath53 when @xmath54 .",
    "however , the source of the zero modes is different , i.e. while @xmath48 receives the zero mode from the model - dependent part including the @xmath55 term , @xmath56 receives the zero mode from the model independent dirac coupling part , @xmath57 .",
    "the explicit forms of @xmath58 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that @xmath59 is the same as @xmath60 as well as the manifestly covariant result @xmath27 .",
    "we also confirmed that our @xmath59 is exactly the same as the one obtained by jaus  @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( 4.22 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the other hand , in the standard lfqm presented in  @xcite , the constituent quark and antiquark in a bound state are required to be on - mass - shell , which is different from the covariant bs formalism in which the constituents are off - mass - shell . in the standard lf ( slf )",
    "approach used in the lfqm  @xcite , the vector meson decay constant @xmath61 is obtained by the matrix element of the plus component of the currents and the longitudinal polarization vector in 3-dimensional lf momentum space .",
    "effectively , the matrix element @xmath34 in slf is given by [ apslf ] [ j^_h]_slf = _ _ 1_2 ( x,*k*_)r^ss_z__1_2(x,*k * _ ) ^ , where @xmath62 is the radial wave function and @xmath63^{1/2}$ ] is the spin - orbit wave function that is obtained by the interaction- independent melosh transformation from the ordinary spin - orbit wave function assigned by the quantum numbers @xmath64 .",
    "the common feature of the standard lfqm is to use the sum ( i.e. invariant mass @xmath65 ) of the light - front energy of the constituent quark and antiquark for the meson mass in @xmath66 .",
    "the virtue of using @xmath65 is to satisfy the normalization of @xmath67 automatically regardless of any kinds of vector mesons , i.e. @xmath68 . the explicit helicity components of @xmath67 for a vector meson are given in  @xcite . for the radial wave function @xmath62",
    ", we use the gaussian wave function @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the variational parameter fixed by the analysis of meson mass spectra  @xcite and @xmath71 is the jacobian of the variable transformation @xmath72 .",
    "in the last section , we started from the manifestly covariant bethe - salpeter model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and performed the lf energy integration to get the lfbs model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) .",
    "we also discussed the slf model from the standard lfqm approach where the constituent quark and antiquark are taken as the on - mass - shell degrees of freedom . in this section",
    ", we shall analyze the relations between @xmath73 obtained from @xmath74_{\\rm lfbs}$ ] and @xmath61 from @xmath74_{\\rm slf}$ ] .",
    "if the on - mass - shell spin structure of the matrix element in slf approach is exactly reproducible from the manifestly covariant model , the slf result is identified to be lorentz covariant .    for the direct comparison between @xmath75 and @xmath61",
    ", we find  @xcite that @xmath61 is exactly reproducible from the lfbs model if and only if the following correspondence is applied [ eq:26 ] , m m_0 . in the integrand of the formulae for @xmath60 and @xmath59 .",
    "the essential point of this replacement is to apply the replacement of @xmath76 to all physical mass terms in the integrands of @xmath60 and @xmath59 . with such self - consistent replacement ,",
    "we find numerically that the three different forms @xmath60 , @xmath59 and @xmath77 indeed yield the identical result .",
    "moreover , we find that the on - shell contribution @xmath78 to @xmath59 also gives the same result with the other three , i.e. @xmath79 in the standard lfqm . from those observations , we conclude that the replacement given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) provides the self - consistent correspondence in connecting the covariant bs model and the standard lfqm .",
    "this self - consistent correspondence implies the proper absorption of the zero - mode contribution essential for the link between chiral symmetry of qcd and lfqm .",
    "more detailed discussions can be found in  @xcite .    although those four different forms give the same result with each other when applying the replacement in eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) , their quark das are quite different .",
    "therefore , by checking the das as an important constraint of the model , we are able to further pindown the self - consistent lf covariant forms of the decay constant . the quark da of a vector meson , @xmath80 , is the probability of finding collinear quarks up to the scale @xmath81 in the @xmath82 projection of the meson wave function .",
    "the dependence on the scale @xmath81 is given by the qcd evolution and can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "however , the das at a certain low scale can be obtained by the necessary nonperturbative input from lfqm .",
    "moreover , the presence of the damping gaussian wave function allows us to perform the integral up to infinity without loss of generality .",
    "the quark da for a vector meson is constrained by  @xcite [ eq : da ] ^1_0_v(x , ) dx = .",
    "one may also redefine the normalized quark da as @xmath83 so that @xmath84 .    for the equal quark and antiquark bound state meson such as @xmath11 , we find that only two forms of the decay constant , i.e. @xmath61 from the longitudinal polarization and @xmath78  @xcite ( with the replacement given by eq .",
