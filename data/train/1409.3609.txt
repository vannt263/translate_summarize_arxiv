    "the ongoing qcd axion detection is based on the bosonic coherent motion ( bcm ) .",
    "the qcd axion can be a fundamental pseudoscalar or a composite one @xcite .",
    "but , after the discovery of the fundamental brout - englert - higgs ( beh ) boson , a fundamental qcd axion gain much more weight .",
    "this leads to a beh portal to the high energy scale to the axion scale or even to the standard model ( sm ) singlets at the grand unification ( gut ) scale .",
    "can these singlets explain both dark energy ( de ) and cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe ? because the axion decay constant @xmath0 , signifying the axion window , can be in the intermediate scale , axions can live up to now ( @xmath1 ) and constitute dm of the universe . in this year of a gut scale vev , can these explain the inflation finish in addition to de and cdm ?",
    "but we have to worry about the quantum gravity effects which are known to break global symmetries , especially via the planck scale wormholes . to resolve this dilemma",
    ", we can think of two possibilities of discrete symmetries below @xmath2@xcite : ( i ) the discrete symmetry arises as a part of a gauge symmetry , and ( ii ) the string selection rules directly give the discrete symmetry .",
    "so , we will consider discrete gauge symmetries allowed in string compactification . even though the goldstone boson directions in spontaneously broken gauge symmetries are flat , the goldstone boson directions of spontaneously broken _ global _ symmetries are not flat ,",
    "_ i.e.  _ global symmetries are always _ approximate_. the question is what is the degree of the _ approximateness_. in fig .",
    "[ fig : discrete ] , we present a cartoon separating effective terms according to string - allowed discrete symmetries . the terms in the vertical column represent exact symmmetries such as gauge symmetries and string allowed discrete symmetries .",
    "if we consider a few terms in the lavender part , we can consider a _",
    "global symmetry_. the global symmetry is broken by terms in the red part .",
    "the most studied global symmetry is the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry u(1)@xmath3 . for u(1)@xmath3 ,",
    "the dominant breaking term is the qcd anomaly term @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gluon field strength .",
    "since @xmath6 gives a neutron edm ( nedm ) of order @xmath7 cm , the upper bound on nedm restricts @xmath8 .  why is @xmath6 so small ? \" is the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "axion osmology was started in 19821983 .",
    "one key point i want to stress here is the axion domain wall ( dw ) problem @xcite .",
    "but the recent numerical study @xcite of axion creation by decay of axionic dws is too large , which gave a strong lower bound on the axion mass @xcite from the bicep2 data @xcite . for the dw problem from string",
    ", there is a solution of choi - kim @xcite , which has been recently used for the anomalous u(1 ) from string @xcite in view of the gut scale inflation implied by the bicep2 data .",
    "a smoking gun for the axion cdm is detecting an oscillating @xmath6 . in this spirit",
    ", an oscillating nedm was suggested to be measured 20 years ago @xcite , and it got renewed interests recently @xcite .",
    "a guideline for the axion - photon - photon coupling is a string calculation , @xmath9 @xcite in the @xmath10 model @xcite .",
    "coupling vs. axion mass .",
    "the green line is a string calculation @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the axion oscillation is just one example of bcm , classified as * bcm1 * in @xcite .",
    "the qcd axion naturally arises if one tries to interpret the de scale by spontaneously breaking an _ approximate _",
    "u(1 ) global symmetry , u(1)@xmath11 .",
    "a recent calculation of the cosmic axion density gives the axion window , @xmath12 , including the anharmonic term carefully with the new data on light quark masses @xcite .",
    "it is known that string axions from @xmath13 have gut scale decay constants @xcite .",
    "therefore , the qcd axion from string theory is better to arise from matter fields originating from 10-dimensional adjoint representation of e@xmath14e@xmath15 @xcite .",
    "note that the global symmetry violating terms belong to the red part in fig .",
    "[ fig : discrete ] . for the qcd axion ,",
    "the dominant breaking is by the qcd anomaly term .",
    "the qcd anomaly term is too large to account for the de scale of @xmath16 . because the beh scalar is known to be a fundamental one , we extend the fundamentality to the sm singlet scalars also .",
    "these singlets must couple to @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e.  _ a kind of beh portal .",
    "so , to relate the de scale to a pseudo - goldstone boson from u(1)@xmath11 , we must forbid the coupling to the qcd anomaly term , which can be done only by introducing another _ global _",
    "u(1 ) , _ i.e.  _ to remove the u(1)@xmath11-@xmath18-@xmath18 anomaly with @xmath19 qcd .",
    "namely , another u(1 ) must be introduced so that one linear combination is free of the qcd anomaly . thus , introduction of two global symmetries is inevitable to interpret the de scale in terms of a potential of a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "let us call these two global symmetries as u(1)@xmath3  and u(1)@xmath11 .",
    "the breaking scale of u(1)@xmath11  is trans - planckian @xcite . with u(1)@xmath3and u(1)@xmath11",
    ", one can construct a de model from string compactification @xcite . using the susy language ,",
    "the discrete and global symmetries below @xmath20 are the consequence of the full superpotential @xmath21 .",
    "so , the exact symmetries related to string compactification are respected by the full @xmath21 ,",
    "_ i.e.  _ the vertical column of fig .",
    "[ fig : discrete ] . considering only the @xmath22 superpotential @xmath23",
    ", we can consider an approximate pq symmetry .",
    "for the mssm interactions supplied by r - parity , one needs to know all the sm singlet spectrum",
    ". we need @xmath24 for a wimp candidate .",
    "the de potential height is so small , @xmath16 , that the needed discrete symmetry breaking term of fig .",
    "[ fig : discrete ] must be small , implying the discrete symmetry is of high order .",
    "now , we have a scheme to explain both 68% of de and 27% of cdm via approximate _ global _ symmetries .",
    "with susy , axino may contribute to cdm also @xcite .",
    "a typical example for the discrete symmetry is @xmath25 as shown in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 charges descend from a gauge u(1 ) charges of the string compactification @xcite .",
    "the u(1 ) defining terms , _",
    "i.e.  _ the lavender part of fig [ fig : discrete ] , is @xmath26 .",
    "then , the height of the potential is highly suppressed and we can obtain @xmath27 , without the gravity spoil of the global symmetry . in this scheme with beh portal",
    ", we introduced three vev scales , tev scale for @xmath28 , the gut scale @xmath29  for singlet vevs , and the intermediate scale for the qcd axion .",
    "the other fundamental scale is @xmath20 .",
    "the trans - planckian decay constant @xmath30 can be a derived scale @xcite .",
    "spontaneous breaking of u(1)@xmath11  is via a mexican hat potential with the height of @xmath31 .",
    "a byproduct of this mexican hat potential is the hilltop inflation with the height of @xmath32 .",
    "it is a small field inflation , consistent with the recent planck data .",
    "with the surprising report from the bicep2 group on a large tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath33 @xcite , we must consider the above hilltop inflation whether it leads to appropriate numbers on @xmath34 and the e - fold number @xmath35 or not . with two u(1 )",
    "s , the large trans - planckian @xmath30 is not spoiled by the intermediate pq scale @xmath0 because the pq scale just adds to the @xmath30 decay constant only by a tiny amount .",
    "inflaton potentials with almost flat one near the origin , such as the coleman - weinberg type new inflation , were the early attempts for inflation .",
    "but any models can lead to inflation if the potential is flat enough as in the _",
    "chaotic inflation _",
    "a single field chaotic inflation survived now is the @xmath36 scenario _",
    "chaotic inflation_. to shrink the field energy much smaller than @xmath37 , a _ natural inflation _",
    "( mimicking the axion - type minus - cosine potential ) has been introduced @xcite .",
    "if a large @xmath33 is observed , lyth noted that the field value @xmath38 must be larger than @xmath39 , which is known as the lyth bound @xcite . to obtain this trans - planckian field value , the kim - nilles - peloso ( knp )",
    "2-flation has been introduced with two axions @xcite .",
    "it is known recently that the natural inflation is more than @xmath40 away from the central value of bicep2 , @xmath41 . in general , the hilltop inflation gives almost zero @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , for the u(1)@xmath11hilltop inflation to give a large @xmath33 , one must introduce another field which is called _ chaoton _ because it provides the behavior of @xmath36 term at the bicep2 point @xcite . with this hilltop potential ,",
    "the height is of order @xmath37 and the decay constant is required to be @xmath42 .",
    "certainly , the potential energy is smaller than order @xmath37 for @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "since this hilltop potential is obtained from the mother discrete symmetry , such as @xmath25 , the flat valley at the trans - planckian @xmath30 is possible , for which the necessary condition is given in terms of quantum numbers of @xmath25 @xcite .    with the gut scale vacuum energy during inflation , the reheating temperature after inflation is most likely above @xmath44 .",
    "this has led to the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath0 is around or smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "but this study depends on the numerical calculation of @xcite .",
    "that is the reason for the recent interests on axion string - dw system .",
    "a particular interest is the choi - kim mechanism @xcite where several vacua are identified by a subgroup of the goldstone boson direction .",
    "it is particularly useful in string compactification with the anomalous u(1 ) surviving as a global symmetry down to the axion window scale , because the model - independent axion corresponding to the anomalous u(1 ) has dw number one @xcite .",
