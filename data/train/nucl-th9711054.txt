    "the observed  @xcite @xmath0 emission from the weak decay of @xmath1he has been an intriguing puzzle for more than 30 years .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath0 to @xmath5 ratio for @xmath1he decay is about 5% , whereas no unambiguous @xmath0 events have been observed for other hypernuclei .",
    "since the mesonic decay modes of the free @xmath3 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) produce only @xmath5s and @xmath8s , more complicated mechanisms must be responsible for the @xmath0s in the decay of the bound @xmath3 in @xmath1he . in this paper",
    ", we propose a solution to the puzzle involving the virtual @xmath2 component of the @xmath1he wave function .    the strangeness @xmath9 @xmath10 conversion , which leads to strong coupling of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels , appears to play an important role in the physics of the light @xmath3 hypernuclei .",
    "the @xmath13 coupling is much more significant in hypernuclei than is the ( octet  decuplet ) coupling of the nucleon to the @xmath14(1232 ) in ordinary nuclear physics .",
    "not only is the @xmath15 stable with respect to the strong interaction , whereas the @xmath14 is not , and the mass difference between @xmath3 and @xmath15 just some 80 mev , the octet  decuplet coupling in the nonstrange sector ( @xmath16 ) can , because of duality , be at least partially subsumed in the one  boson  exchange ( obe ) model of the @xmath17 interaction , without requiring explicit @xmath14s .",
    "body @xmath3 hypernuclei data clearly suggest that @xmath13 coupling is important .",
    "the hypertriton , @xmath18h , would likely not be bound without it  @xcite .",
    "charge symmetry breaking ( csb ) in the @xmath19 isodoublet is obvious : @xmath1he is more bound than @xmath1h by 0.35 mev , almost three times the 0.12 mev estimated for the @xmath20h@xmath20he isodoublet once the coulomb energy is taken into account . in other words , the @xmath21 interaction is stronger than the @xmath22 interaction .",
    "this csb in the hyperon ",
    "nucleon ( @xmath23 ) interaction arises in large part due to the @xmath24 mass difference of some 8 mev ( about 10% of the 80 mev @xmath25 mass difference ) ; @xmath21 couples to @xmath26 , while @xmath22 couples to @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , significant @xmath25 conversion effects in @xmath3 hypernuclei are also suggested by comparing @xmath3 separation energies from @xmath18h , @xmath1he , and @xmath28he with neutron separation energies from @xmath29h , @xmath20h , and @xmath30he .",
    "the ratio of neutron separation energies for neighboring @xmath4shell nuclei is close to a constant : @xmath31 therefore , one might anticipate for the @xmath3 separation energy that @xmath32 for calculations in which @xmath33 is fitted to the low  energy @xmath11 scattering data and which reproduce the observed value of @xmath34 mev .",
    "this is confirmed by model calculations  @xcite in which central potentials represent the @xmath11 force .",
    "but such is not the case experimentally ; the observed value for @xmath35he ) is only 3.10(2 ) mev  @xcite .",
    "similarly , for the hypertriton , one might anticipate that @xmath36 this is the model result using central potentials to represent the @xmath11 interaction  @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental value for @xmath37h ) is 0.13(5 ) mev . from these considerations",
    "one can infer that @xmath13 coupling is an important aspect of modeling the @xmath23 interaction .    until now",
    "a cogent explanation of the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1he has been lacking .",
    "dalitz and von hippel  @xcite explored the issue in depth .",
    "they considered two  body decay processes of the type : ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 decay followed by a @xmath40 charge  exchange reaction , and ( @xmath41 ) @xmath42 decay following a @xmath43 conversion .",
    "their conclusion was that neither process could account for more than a 1% @xmath0 decay rate .",
    "dalitz discussed the possibilities at length in his varenna lectures  @xcite but apparently found the problem intractable .",
    "he argued that the experimental observation identifying @xmath42 decay as a @xmath44wave process ruled out the promising explanation coming from von hippel s calculations  @xcite , which had found that only @xmath4wave @xmath2 decay might yield a sufficiently high rate .",
    "more recently , ciepl and gal  @xcite have re - examined the charge ",
    "exchange contribution to @xmath0 emission in @xmath1he decay .",
    "they concluded that even though their improved calculation with up  to  date input parameters yields a 1.2% branching ratio , some twice as large as that obtained by dalitz and von hippel , the charge ",
    "exchange mechanism by itself can not account for the experimental value of about 5% .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the experimental situation which leads to our suggested explanation for the @xmath0 decay mode . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the theoretical model assumptions and estimates .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0 decays to @xmath5 decays for @xmath45he is defined as @xmath46 the measurement coming from the bubble chamber study by keyes _",
    "et al_.  @xcite yielded a value @xmath47 .",
    "results from mayeur _ et al_.  @xcite and from bohm _ et al_.  @xcite are quoted as lying within the range @xmath48 thus , we see an approximately 5(2)% @xmath0 decay probability observed in the experiments .",
    "sacton s review  @xcite of the experimental situation provides a cogent summary of these results , including those from the papers by mayeur _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and by gajewski _ et al_.  @xcite .",
    "we reproduce the data in fig .",
    "1 in which we compare the pion kinetic energy spectra for the following four decay processes : @xmath49 the @xmath5 spectrum from @xmath1he into @xmath50he , process ( @xmath51 ) , is peaked at a kinetic energy of around 30 mev , as one would expect for @xmath5s coming from an underlying @xmath52 free decay .",
    "the tail extends down to 15 mev .",
    "the @xmath5 decay of @xmath1h into @xmath50h , process ( @xmath53 ) , is similarly peaked but several mev higher .",
    "the primary strength for @xmath1h decay lies in the @xmath1h @xmath54he analog mode  @xcite , so that the spectrum of ( @xmath53 ) contains many fewer events than that of ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "et al_.  @xcite present a later summary of such @xmath5 decay data .",
    "our interpretation of ( @xmath51 ) is that one is looking at processes dominated by @xmath52 decay embedded within a very light nucleus , so that fermi smearing of the peak is limited .",
    "the low  energy side of the peak could easily come from final  state rescattering .",
    "the possible three ",
    "body @xmath55 decay process is less likely to leave behind a bound trinucleon .",
    "indeed , specific decay events involving two protons in the final state have been identified  @xcite .",
    "however , we would expect to see @xmath5 events with kinetic energies of less than 15 mev , if @xmath5s from three  body decay processes were of consequence .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the @xmath5 kinetic energy spectrum for @xmath1h into @xmath56he , process ( @xmath57 ) , and into @xmath50h , process ( @xmath53 ) , look similar to that for ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "they exhibit a peak in the region corresponding to the @xmath52 free decay peak .",
    "( in addition , there exist four events at low energy , below 15 mev . )",
    "we suggest that the two  body ( @xmath52 ) decay appearance comes from @xmath58 where the @xmath30he@xmath59 @xmath60 states decay equally into @xmath56he and @xmath50h .",
    "sacton shows in his table i that the two  body decay @xmath1h @xmath61he generates some ten times the number of events that the three  body decay @xmath1h @xmath62h produces .",
    "thus , we infer ( @xmath38 ) that the three  body decay modes ( @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath53 ) are closely related , as the number of events for each in fig",
    ".  1 indicates , and ( @xmath41 ) that they come primarily from the decay of the @xmath60 @xmath30he excited states , following @xmath5 emission .",
    "these conclusions about the strong final  state interactions involved in ( @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath53 ) are supported by the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is argued that a naive calculation not taking into account resonant final states fails . however , the low",
    " energy @xmath5s are most likely to come from multi ",
    "nucleon final states , as we discuss below .",
    "such a picture is not in contradiction with the physics of process ( @xmath51 ) , where the lowest threshold for @xmath5 decay of @xmath1he is through the @xmath63 excited states of @xmath30li .",
    "the @xmath63 four  nucleon interactions are much weaker than the @xmath60 interactions .",
    "thus , the nucleonic final  state interactions should be of less consequence in process ( @xmath51 ) , which leads one to a spectrum for the observed @xmath5s more in agreement with naive expectations for a decay dominated by the free @xmath52 process with no final  state interactions .",
    "moreover , the peak in ( @xmath51 ) should be at lower energy than that in ( @xmath57 ) and ( @xmath53 ) , as it indeed appears to be in fig .  1 .",
    "the @xmath1he @xmath64he decay mode ( @xmath65 ) is the puzzle that we wish to address .",
    "we observe from fig .  1 that , unlike the @xmath5 decay spectra which are peaked according to two  body decay ( @xmath52 ) expectations , the @xmath0 spectrum from the @xmath1he @xmath66 decay is flat in terms of the @xmath0 energy distribution .",
    "moreover , it is stated in ref .",
    "@xcite that for @xmath0 kinetic energies below 22 mev multi ",
    "neutron final states are likely .",
    "therefore , the label `` @xmath20h '' in process ( @xmath65 ) and in the caption for fig .",
    "1@xmath65 should be interpreted as `` @xmath20h or @xmath67h or @xmath68h . ''",
    "this is even more clearly stipulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the final state is labeled `` @xmath69 . ''",
    "furthermore , we note the paucity of events for pion kinetic energies above that corresponding to the threshold for four  nucleon decay .",
    "analogously , the low  energy @xmath5s seen in the @xmath5 spectra in fig .",
    "1 are likely due to such multi  nucleon final states . the more complete compilation of @xmath0 decay data from ref .",
    "@xcite , as reproduced in fig .",
    "2 , confirms the flat character of the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "moreover , keyes _",
    "et al_.  @xcite argue that the data suggest the @xmath0 emission process is predominantly @xmath4wave .",
    "therefore , we conclude there is no evidence that the two  body decay of the virtual @xmath2 , assumed to be operative by von hippel , can account for the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "dalitz and von hippel considered a number of second  order processes to explain the @xmath0 emission of @xmath1he .",
    "the possibility of charge exchange @xmath40 following @xmath39 decay was estimated  @xcite to provide at most a 0.6% decay rate probability .",
    "furthermore , dalitz suggested that @xmath70 and @xmath71 decays , considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , do not appear to contribute significantly to the @xmath5 spectra for pion kinetic energies below 15 mev , where a significant number of the @xmath0 events lie . hence , @xmath0 decay would necessarily need to occur via a different three  body mechanism , if it is not to be ruled out by the @xmath5 decay spectrum covering the region of pion kinetic energies expected to be dominated by three  body decay processes .",
    "it was such a virtual process ( @xmath72 ) that von hippel studied .",
    "however , von hippel estimated  @xcite that @xmath42 decay contributes at most about 0.2% to the @xmath0/@xmath5 ratio , assuming the decay @xmath42 proceeds preferentially through a relative @xmath44state of the @xmath73 system , as has been observed experimentally for free @xmath2 decay .",
    "von hippel s numerical estimate was based upon a median @xmath0 kinetic energy of 10 mev , in his closure approximation .",
    "the mean @xmath0 kinetic energy is more like 18 mev , which should raise von hippel s estimate by a factor of about two , still too small to account for the experimental observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is the large probability for a virtual @xmath2 which is unique to the @xmath1he hypernucleus : the wave function of @xmath1he can be written schematically as @xmath74 because of its charge , @xmath1he does permit the @xmath3 to make a virtual transition to a @xmath2 without altering the structure of the `` nuclear core '' state , whereas one would anticipate only @xmath75 ( and @xmath76 ) transitions in @xmath1h and other @xmath3 hypernuclei .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath43 transition is the key to understanding the @xmath0 emission .    with this in mind",
    ", we interpret the flat @xmath4wave @xmath0 spectrum seen above as evidence for a _ three  body _ decay mechanism of the type @xmath77 replacing the @xmath42 `` free '' decay unavailable to the deeply bound @xmath15 .",
    "the virtual @xmath78 system is `` off  shell , '' and hence there must be a @xmath77 rescattering reaction to restore the system to `` on  shell '' and free the observed @xmath0s .",
    "we expect both nucleons to carry off kinetic energy , producing a pion spectrum more  or ",
    "less uniformly distributed over the allowed energies from zero to the maximum corresponding to a @xmath79h final state .",
    "one of the two neutrons in the @xmath80 rescattering process could be `` picked up '' by the spectator deuteron to produce a triton .",
    "alternatively , the proton in the @xmath81 rescattering process could be picked up by the spectator di - neutron to produce a triton .",
    "however , were the @xmath20h final state to play a dominant role in the @xmath0 decay , one would expect to see primarily @xmath0 events above the @xmath82h threshold in fig .",
    "1@xmath65 . a three  body decay amplitude of the @xmath77 type , normalized to the theoretically estimated @xmath2 probability in @xmath1he ,",
    "can explain not only the @xmath0 decay branching ratio but also the @xmath4wave angular distribution and the flat energy distribution of the @xmath0s .",
    "one simple estimate of the @xmath2 probability in @xmath1he can be obtained as follows .",
    "glckle and coworkers  @xcite have calculated the @xmath15 probability for the very weakly bound hypertriton to be 0.5% . given the small @xmath18h binding energy of 0.13(5 ) mev , the @xmath15 probability @xmath83 for @xmath1he with @xmath3 separation energy of 2.39(3 )",
    "mev will be much larger .",
    "for example , using a linear extrapolation , @xmath84 taking into account the 3/2 for spin1 @xmath85 pairs in @xmath45he and the 1/4 for such pairs in @xmath18h would push this significantly higher . alternatively , this @xmath15 probability has been estimated in a model calculation  @xcite for the @xmath1he@xmath1h system to be as large as 14% .",
    "therefore , we assume the @xmath2 probability in @xmath1he to be @xmath86    in order to translate this @xmath2 probability into an estimate for the branching ratio @xmath87 , we need to take into account suppression effects due to the pauli principle for the in  medium decay rates , normalized to the @xmath3 and @xmath2 lifetimes in vacuum . according to dalitz and liu  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath5 decay rate of @xmath88he , with three protons in the final state , is strongly pauli suppressed with respect to the @xmath52 decay rate in vacuum ( to about 4045%  of the free decay rate for the @xmath4channel and to about 3035%  for the @xmath44channel ) .    in their calculation ,",
    "dalitz and von hippel  @xcite found that , compared to @xmath5 decay , pauli suppression is about two times stronger for @xmath0 decay of @xmath1he .",
    "the reason is that this @xmath0 decay , requiring both the @xmath3 and a proton , happens inside the `` nuclear core , '' whereas the @xmath5 decay , involving only the @xmath3 itself , takes place outside the core .",
    "we will use this value to estimate the relative importance of pauli suppression .",
    "we note , however , that coulomb repulsion ( not considered by dalitz and von hippel ) favors @xmath0 decay , with three neutrons in the final state , over @xmath5 decay , with three protons in the final state .",
    "the transition @xmath77 is assumed to be an @xmath4wave three  body decay . apart from the fact that this is indicated by the experimental @xmath0 energy distribution , as discussed above , there exists additional evidence for this picture . in the hypertriton",
    ", the virtual @xmath15 is found very close to one of the two nucleons , see fig .  5 of ref .",
    "the @xmath78 pair forms a tightly bound system , with binding energy of 80 mev .",
    "the strong correlation of the @xmath2 with a nucleon indicates that the relevant decay is of the @xmath77 three  body type .",
    "we assume that , apart from the reduction in phase space , the @xmath2 decay rate is unmodified in the medium ; that is , the @xmath2 in  medium three",
    " body decay rate is taken to be approximately equal to ( _ i.e. _ , to essentially replace ) the two  body free decay rate , except for the phase space difference due to the @xmath2 being highly virtual .",
    "the relevant decay ratio in vacuum which we need is @xmath89 where the @xmath90 rule was used , which is well satisfied experimentally .",
    "phase space gives an additional factor @xmath91 , being the ratio of the average @xmath0 momentum for in ",
    "medium @xmath0 decay of @xmath1he to its value for @xmath42 decay in vacuum .",
    "collecting factors , we estimate for the contribution of our three ",
    "body virtual @xmath2 decay to the @xmath0 to @xmath5 branching ratio the value @xmath92 where the factor @xmath93 is due to the relative pauli suppression discussed above , and we assume that the decay via the virtual @xmath76 component is counted primarily in the @xmath5 decay rate .",
    "the main uncertainty comes from that in the @xmath2 probability @xmath94 .",
    "our final value @xmath95 is to be compared to the estimate 0.2%  ( or 0.4%  with the higher average @xmath0 momentum ) given by von hippel  @xcite , which is more than an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "we suggest that _ a @xmath0 to @xmath5 branching ratio @xmath87 of the order of 5% is a plausible result for any model calculation that includes @xmath25 conversion_. clearly , a more realistic model calculation which includes the charge  exchange channel  @xcite as well as the @xmath96 decay mechanism is called for .",
    "an additional reason why @xmath0 emission is less favorable from the light hypernuclei @xmath1h and @xmath28he ( compared to @xmath1he ) is that the resulting final states , with four identical neutrons , are strongly suppressed by the pauli principle .",
    "moreover , in the case of @xmath28he , breakup of the @xmath30he core is required .",
    "in contrast , @xmath5 decay for @xmath1h and @xmath28he can give four nucleons in the favored @xmath60 @xmath30he configuration .",
    "however , the main reason that @xmath0 emission is not observed is the absence of a significant @xmath2 admixture , which is related to lack of an excess of positive charge in the system .    finally , in order for our picture to hold , one should address the absence of low  energy pions in the @xmath5 decay of @xmath1he , shown in fig .  1@xmath51 . two",
    " body decay in process ( @xmath51 ) is by far the dominant decay mode ; observation of three  body contributions would require a much larger data sample to see the few low ",
    "energy @xmath5s anticipated from the few % decay branch of the @xmath76 or other three  body decay mechanisms .",
    "the @xmath1he has no virtual @xmath75 component to provide @xmath5s ; in contrast , the @xmath1h wave function is , schematically , @xmath97 with @xmath98 . for @xmath5 decay of @xmath1h",
    "low  energy pions are expected from the reaction @xmath99 following the @xmath100 virtual transition , but 5% is still a small branch to observe . however , the @xmath5 decay of @xmath1h is dominated by the analog transition to @xmath101he , which absorbs some 70% of the decay strength  @xcite . that is , the analog transition acts as a two  body decay filter .",
    "the remaining 30% of the @xmath5 spectrum , which corresponds to the data in fig .  1@xmath57 and 1@xmath53 , is sufficiently small that the @xmath102 5% of the @xmath5 decays coming from virtual @xmath75 and other three  body decay mechanisms should be large enough to be seen . indeed , a few low ",
    "energy @xmath5 events are observed .",
    "we have presented a plausible solution to the long  standing enigma of @xmath0 emission in the weak decay of @xmath1he . in the spectrum of @xmath0s ,",
    "one `` sees '' the weak three",
    " body decay of a highly ",
    "virtual @xmath2 arising from the in  medium @xmath10 transition .",
    "this resolution of the @xmath0 decay puzzle is consistent with the significant @xmath2 probability unique to the @xmath1he hypernucleus , and also explains in a natural way the experimentally observed @xmath0 energy spectrum and @xmath4wave angular distribution .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 emission in @xmath1he decay provides direct confirmation of the important role played by virtual transitions among members of the baryon octet , _ in casu _",
    "@xmath25 coupling .",
    "this is additionally exemplified by @xmath103 coupling in @xmath104 hypernuclei  @xcite . as a final example",
    ", we mention that it has been pointed out that signatures of @xmath25 mixing should also be visible in the magnetic moments of some hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "based on our picture of a three  body decay of the virtual @xmath2 replacing two - body decay which one sees in the case of the @xmath3 , we conclude that the properties of the @xmath42 free decay are unrelated to the @xmath1he @xmath0 decay observations .",
    "therefore , we disagree with previously published conclusions that the fact that free @xmath2 decay is @xmath44wave prevents the @xmath43 transition , followed by a @xmath77 decay , from explaining the @xmath0 decay puzzle .",
