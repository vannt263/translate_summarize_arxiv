    "for example , in the incoherent regime , eq . ( [ niba_x ] ) predicts at @xmath63 a finite value @xmath64 for @xmath65 while it diverges for @xmath66 .",
    "the implementation of @xmath67 as measurement operator in the pimc is not trivial .",
    "namely , the approach is only efficient when one extracts observables at intermediate times @xmath68 from a _ single run _ over the _ total time _",
    "@xmath69 . hence , since the influence functional is non - local in time , the effective measurement operator in the pimc corresponding to @xmath67 must also include contributions from the bath@xcite ( see also appendix ) .",

    "i.e. , in the incoherent domain , it still provides qualitatively correct results over the time period considered , but fails completely in the coherent range @xmath74 .",

    "the time dependent density operator of the full compound obeys the semi - group property @xmath79 with @xmath80 . in general , this is not true for the reduced density operator ( [ reduced ] ) . however , there are two domains in parameter space where this symmetry holds at least approximately .",
    "one is the domain of very weak coupling , sufficiently high temperatures , and large cut - off frequencies , i.e. , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then , a perturbative treatment including a coarse graining in time ( born - markov approximation ) leads to master equations for @xmath49 which are local in time and are determined by a time - independent generator . in the other domain , coherences ( off - diagonal elements ) in @xmath49 are suppressed due to the bath such that effectively the full density operator at intermediate times takes the form @xmath83/z_b$ ] .",
    "this can be interpreted as a quasi - classical regime , where , however , temperature does not need to be high , but rather friction sufficiently strong .",
    "accordingly , quantum effects may still substantially influence the relaxation dynamics towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "while corresponding rates are of great interest experimentally , to extract them from pimc data , typically requires very expensive long times simulations .",
    "here we focus on this latter regime , not accessible by master equations , and develop a pimc scheme which exploits the fact that a semi - group property applies approximately .",
    "the proposed scheme works for @xmath60 as observable as follows .",

    "now , due to continuity and the exact relation @xmath95 , the first two conditions fix the elements @xmath96 and @xmath97 through the time evolution over the previous segment . to satisfy the third condition one properly adjusts @xmath98 and the bath shift @xmath90 .",
    "the reservoir distribution is thus progressively distorted by the spin dynamics and the reduced density carries information about how the bath modes induce the spin relaxation .",
    "this way , the correct dynamics over the total time interval @xmath99 is approximated by a chain of pimc simulations over time intervals @xmath87 through @xmath100 , \\",

    "if for the combined data one obtains a smooth matching it works , if  kinks  appear , it does not . in the moderate to strong friction regime ,",
    "this implies @xmath102 which can be verified at each intermediate time step ( for details see below ) .",
    "note that the procedure is exact at @xmath103 and thus expected to cover also the domain of very weak coupling .",
    "the computational gain is substantial : as the dynamical sign problem increases exponentially with @xmath33 , the cpu time for a simulation over the total time interval @xmath104 scales as @xmath105 ( @xmath106 is a constant ) while for a chain with @xmath107 segments of length @xmath87 one has an algebraic increase @xmath108 .    in fig .",
    "[ cutting ] results for the ch - pimc are shown for ohmic friction and larger couplings and over a wide temperature range . here ,",
    "we found within the statistical errors an optimal matching for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "hence , at each intermediate time step the drag of the system onto the equilibrium position of the bath is updated which accounts for dynamically induced system - bath correlations .",
    "the procedure also works in the domain of very low temperatures where the relaxation dynamics is strongly influenced by quantum effects but only as long as @xmath111 . at zero temperature off - diagonal elements tend to be considerably larger , namely , @xmath112 , and ",

    "lower temperatures , moderate to strong damping ) one has thus access to the full equilibration dynamics where approximate treatments fail such as e.g. weak coupling master equations .",
    "when the reduced dynamics is determined by strong coherences , but friction is not extremely weak , the ch - pimc fails as seen in fig .",

    "accordingly , at critical coupling strengths @xmath116 the system exhibits a transition from a delocalized state [ @xmath117 with tunneling between the two spin orientations ( weak friction ) to a localized one [ @xmath118 with basically classical behavior ( stronger friction ) occurs . with respect to the relaxation dynamics ,",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that there is a coherent - incoherent transition in the regime @xmath119 at coupling strengths @xmath120 , while such a transition is absent with coherences surviving even for ultra - strong coupling in the domain @xmath121 ( cf .",

    "we note in passing that for a pure dephasing model ( @xmath126 ) which can be solved analytically coherent oscillations persist up to arbitrary strong couplings below a critical @xmath127 @xcite .    in this section",
    "we will explore first to what extent coherences are robust against finite temperatures and various cut - off procedures to better understand the domain in parameter space where the ch - pimc is expected to work .",
    "second , in the so determined incoherent regime relaxation rates are obtained from ch - pimc data and compared to niba predictions .      the central ingredient in the influence functional ( [ inffct ] ) which captures the impact of the reservoir is the bath correlation ( [ qt ] ) .",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ finite_t ] which displays the changeover from oscillatory to overdamped motion at @xmath140 with increasing temperature .",
    "indeed , for temperatures @xmath141 coherences are washed out and after a transient period of time the dynamics turns into a monotone relaxation described by a single time constant , the relaxation rate .",
    "it is this rate that we extract below within the ch - pimc .",
    "before we do so , however , let us analyze the sensitivity of the coherent dynamics on the cut - off procedure . according to ( [ omegaeff ] ) it is mainly determined by the reorganization energy @xmath142 .",
    "the corresponding integral is dominated by the low frequency profile of the spectral density @xmath143 . as a consequence , for sufficiently large cut - off frequencies @xmath144 dynamical properties of @xmath60 are basically independent of the specific form of the cut - off , e.g. , a smooth exponential as in ( [ specdens ] ) or a sharp cut - off as in @xmath145 .",

    "[ cutoff ] for @xmath63 .",
    "even a small @xmath147 pushes the dynamics toward an incoherent decay similar to that at elevated temperatures , while varying the ultra - violet cut - off scheme has almost no influence but only leads to a renormalization of the tunnel coupling @xcite .    to summarize this analysis",
    ", we find incoherent relaxation dynamics in the sub - ohmic sbm for finite temperatures also in the domain @xmath121 .",

    "[ sigmax - so ] for various temperatures and coupling strengths .",
    "as expected , stronger friction and finite temperatures lead to a suppression of off - diagonal elements of the reduced density and thus drive the system towards a classical distribution . the niba expression ( [ niba_x ] ) captures the pimc data qualitatively correctly , but quantitative agreement is only found for sufficiently high temperatures and stronger couplings . in the low temperatures range , the niba predictions provide a reliable estimate only for long times .",
