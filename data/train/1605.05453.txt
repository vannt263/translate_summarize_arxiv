    "<S> we explore the possibly that either starspots or pulsations are the cause of a periodic radial - velocity signal ( @xmath0  days ) from the k - giant binary @xmath1  octantis ( @xmath2  days , @xmath3 ) , alternatively conjectured to have a retrograde planet . </S>",

    "<S> provide unexpected support for the planet since other standard explanations ( starspots , pulsations and additional stellar masses ) each have credibility problems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the proposed system presents formidable challenges to planet - formation and stability theories : it has by far the smallest stellar separation of any claimed planet - harbouring binary ( @xmath4  au ) and an equally unbelievable separation ratio ( @xmath5 ) , hence the necessity that the circumstellar orbit be retrograde .    the ldr analysis of 215 spectra acquired between 20012007 , from which the rv perturbation was first revealed , have no significant periodicity at any frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the ldrs recover the original 21 stellar temperatures with an average accuracy of @xmath6  k. the 215 temperatures have a standard deviation of only 4.2  k. assuming the host primary is not pulsating , the temperatures converted to magnitude differences strikingly mimic the very stable photometric observations 15  years previously , implying the long - term stability of the star and demonstrating a novel use of ldrs as a photometric gauge . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide substantial new evidence that conventional starspots and pulsations are unlikely causes of the rv perturbation . </S>",

    "<S> ramm more or less discounted all other standard causes for the @xmath7  day periodic signal including rotation modulation of surface features , pulsations , and a prograde orbit ( which stability models indicate is rapidly unstable ) . </S>",
    "<S> significant surface dynamics were not supported by their bisector analysis and observations ( esa 1997 ) had already found to be particularly photometrically stable ( see ) . has been found consistently to be inactive and without significant variability at all other studied spectral regions , for instance ca(warner 1969 ) , radio ( slee 1989 ; beasley , stewart & carter 1992 ) and x - ray . </S>",
    "<S> instrument- and data - reduction - related causes for the rv behaviour were discounted by ramm as their paper included a similar sb1 , @xmath8  reticuli ( k2  iii ; gray 2006 ) frequently observed on the same nights whose rvs had no such anomalous behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal by morais & correia ( 2012 ) that is actually a hierarchical triple system has merit given how frequently such systems are anticipated and observed ( tokovinen 2006 ; tokovinen , hartung & hayward 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this scenario is challenged by the lack of observational support . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , their model predicts an apsidal precession rate of @xmath9 for the primary star s orbit . </S>",
    "<S> yet , the orbital solution for the historical rvs ( which date back to 19041924 ) , re - derived in ramm ( 2004 ) and provided in , suggests there is no such change , since these rvs yield @xmath10 and the rvs from 20012006 yield @xmath11 . </S>",

    "<S> it is the prediction that the planet orbit must be retrograde with respect to the stellar orbits that makes the planet so far unique . </S>",
    "<S> this geometry is fundamentally different from the growing list of transiting exoplanets which demonstrate , via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect , that their orbits can also be retrograde , since the r - m effect can only determine anti - alignment of a planet orbit s axis with respect to the host star s rotation axis ( the first such exoplanet being hat - p-7b : narita 2009 ; winn 2009 ) . </S>",
    "<S> other planets may also have retrograde orbits but their true nature is so far hidden by the circumstances of their discoveries , such as the absence of an observable r - m effect , or the absence of the demands of stability modelling as applies to . </S>",
    "<S> rather than ` simple ' planet migration to explain all orbit evolution scenarios , both types of retrograde geometry imply substantial dynamical interactions can have a leading role .    </S>",
    "<S> the controversial geometry of has been investigated with increasing depth beginning with eberle & cuntz ( 2010 ) and subsequently by quarles , cuntz & musielak ( 2012 ) and godziewski ( 2013 ) . </S>",
    "<S> godziewski explored the system in considerable detail and found that stable solutions consistent with the ramm results existed but were confined to tiny regions of the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> not only is this geometry unprecedented but the formation of such a system is generally considered incompatible with theoretical expectations ( paardekooper , thbault & mellema 2008 ; kley 2010 ; thbault 2011 ; rafikov & silsbee 2015 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the work of , for example trilling ( 2007 ) , suggests otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> they studied infra - red excesses of close main - sequence a3-f8 binaries  encompassing the likely spectral range of s progenitor  and found a large fraction ( @xmath31 per cent ) with small separations ( @xmath32  au , as has ) had infra - red excesses : about 50 per cent consistent with circumbinary debris discs and about 30 per cent consistent with circumstellar discs . </S>",
    "<S> occasionally , the deduced debris disks were located in apparently unstable orbits . </S>",
    "<S> these results they claim suggests planet formation in such close binaries may not be so unlikely after all . </S>",

    "<S> ( bakos 2007 ) , superwasp ( collier cameron 2007 ) , and the @xmath56 mission ( see batalha 2011 ; rowe 2014 ) , most were discovered by the radial - velocity technique . </S>",

    "<S> jofr ( 2015 ) and reffert ( 2015 ) describe two recent analyses of large samples of evolved stars with and without planets . </S>",
    "<S> approximately 1015 per cent of claims , including b , are unconfirmed , retracted or controversial .    </S>",
    "<S> the number of planets found in multiple stellar systems also continues to grow but discoveries there are less frequent , and doppler - spectroscopic planet searches are understandably biased against binaries as tightly bound as . </S>",
    "<S> a recent review of planets in such systems by roell ( 2012 ) deduced the fraction of sytems with exoplanets was then about 12% ( of 477 host systems , 47 were binaries and 10 triple ) . </S>",
    "<S> varied efforts to discover unknown stellar companions have routinely identified new components ( early examples being patience 2002 , mugrauer 2004 , and raghavan 2006 ) , so this fraction can not be considered likely to be definitive . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of planets found in binary systems are circumstellar but a few have been identified in circumbinary ( p - type ) geometries hw  vir ( lee 2009 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more recent studies , such as spots ( search for planets orbiting two stars ) , are specifically targeting close binary systems ( thalmann 2014 ) . </S>",
    "<S> spots is using direct imaging to search for planets in circumbinary orbits in small - separation systems comparable to that of ( @xmath59  au ) .    </S>",
    "<S> all of the so - far - discovered circumstellar planets in multiple systems have binary separations exceeding that of by an order of magnitude or so , and generally a lot more . </S>",
    "<S> the systems that are tightest ( @xmath60  au ) include @xmath58 cephei a ( cambell , walker & yang 1988 ; hatzes 2003 ) , gj  86  a ( queloz 2000 ) , hd41004  a ( zucker 2004 ) , and hd196885  a ( correia 2008 ; thbault 2011 ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , @xmath58  cep  a ( which has stellar properties very similar to - see fuhrmann 2004 ) , was briefly considered one of the strongest candidates for hosting the first rv - detected exoplanet until later work regrettably questioned that possibility ( walker 1992 ) , and gj  86  ab was one of the other earliest planet discoveries . </S>",
    "<S> most recently @xmath61  cen  b </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath62  au ) has been claimed to host a very close planet ( dumusque 2012 ; @xmath63  days ) but its existence has been challenged ( hatzes 2013 ) . </S>",
    "<S> other planets claimed in tight binaries , such as that for hd188753 ( @xmath64  </S>",
    "<S> au ) were later shown to be non - existent ( eggenberger 2007 ) . </S>",
    "<S> none of these systems have separation ratios anywhere near as large as that claimed for , with @xmath58  cep , hd196885 and hd41004 all having @xmath65 .    thus , is the seat of one of the many unconfirmed and , in view of its geometry , perhaps most extraordinary of the controversial planets . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is appropriate that all available investigations be pursued to eliminate or support alternative explanations . whilst provided sound reasons to discredit spots and pulsation as the likely cause of the supposed planet signal , besides their bisector analysis which was inconsistent with either stellar cause , much of that reasoning was qualitative . </S>",
    "<S> our effort here is to provide further quantitative evidence for the lack of support for these surface - dynamical causes .    </S>",
    "<S> stellar activity in the form of spots or pulsation are expected to reveal themselves in many ways , including radial velocity , photometric , spectral - line and surface - temperature variations . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric stability of has already been mentioned ( esa 1997 ) and recorded in . </S>",
    "<S> high - resolution spectra obtained for radial velocity purposes are ideal for studies of spectral - line profiles , symmetries and depths , when , as is the case for , the spectra are uncomplicated ( it is strictly sb1 ) and sharp - lined ( due to its late spectral type and low rotation ; @xmath66 : costa 2002 ; fuhrmann & chini 2012 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the most common way spectral - line variations are studied for assessing the reality of exoplanets is of the bisectors of the lines themselves ( gray 1982 , 1983 ; gray & hatzes 1997 ) or of the cross - correlation function ( queloz 2001 ) . but </S>",
    "<S> measurements derived from bisection , as valuable as it is , is essentially limited to assessing the profile for asymmetry against which velocities can be compared convective velocities gray ( 1982 ) or suspected planet signals queloz ( 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bisector spans can also be related in a fairly general way to spectral types ( gray 1982 ; gray 1992 ) but there is no apparent opportunity to convert these bisector spans quantitatively to a fundamental property such as effective temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> a star s effective temperature , , is a critical parameter as it has fundamental and far - reaching consequences for many other stellar characteristics . as a consequence , many methods have been devised to measure it . in their comparison of two methods , one based on iron excitation and ionization balance and the other the infrared flux method , tsantaki ( 2013 ) list several others that include interferometry ( using the relationship between diameter and luminosity ) , photometrically derived colour indices ( which have different dependencies on temperature ) , and line properties such as the h@xmath61 wings , spectral synthesis strategies and , the method we will employ , line - depth ratios ( ldrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> gray ( 1992 ) also discusses various methods , including ldrs . </S>",
    "<S> whilst ldrs perhaps require more reduction effort than some of these methods , they have many advantageous qualities . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , line depths are measured downward from the continuum so they should not suffer from zero - point errors , they should be applicable to composite spectra , and , unlike photometric methods , are independent of interstellar extinction and , within sensible limits , sky quality ( gray & brown 2001 ) .    over the past couple of decades or so , </S>",
    "<S> many papers have been published describing the extraordinary sensitivity of ratios of the depths of suitably chosen pairs of spectral lines for a star s effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> ldrs may only provide accuracy in the tens of degrees , but their sensitivity allows precision an order - of - magnitude smaller as each of the following references ( and many others ) will testify . </S>",
    "<S> thus they provide an ideal strategy for assessing variability of , and as a result of the corresponding implications for monitoring surface dynamics , a worthy tool partnered with bisectors for evaluating claimed discoveries of substellar companions .    </S>",
    "<S> ldrs have been used to study inactive main - sequence ( gray & johanson 1991 ; gray 1994 ; kovtyukh 2003 ) , giant ( gray & brown 2001 ; kovtyukh 2006 ) , and supergiant stars ( kovtyukh 2007 ; pugh & gray 2013 ) as well as active stars ( gray & baliunas 1995 ; padgett 1996 ; catalano 2002 ) including the sun s 11-year cycle ( gray & livingston 1997 ) . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , these temperatures can be used to monitor and assess starspots ( active stars ; catalano 2002 ; oneal 2006 ; biazzo 2007 ) , pulsation cycles ( of cephieds : kovtyukh & gorlova 2000 , and antares  a : pugh & gray 2013 ) , and hence to help support claims for the non - existence or existence of exoplanets ( 51  peg ; gray 1997 ; hatzes , cochran & bakker 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these latter examples demonstrate the relatively long though infrequent history ldrs have had with exoplanet research .    </S>",
    "<S> our paper continues to sect .  2 where the observational details are given , together with our reductions , choice of spectra lines and our set of ldrs . </S>",
    "<S> in sect .  3 </S>",
    "<S> we describe the ldr construction , error management of them , and the behaviour of our ldrs with regards to . in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 the temperature calibration is described , and in sect .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 we discuss the consequences of our results that will further challenge the possibility that s rv - perturbation might be caused by conventional spots or pulsation .    </S>",
    "<S> the chelle spectra were obtained between 2001 and 2007 at mt john university observatory ( mjuo ) , new zealand using the 1-m mclellan telescope and , a fibre - fed , vacuum - housed spectrograph ( @xmath67  atm ; hearnshaw 2002 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrograph is located in a thermally isolated and insulated room . </S>",
    "<S> both optical fibres used for the spectra described here have core diameters of , one with a microslit on its exit face , which provided resolving powers respectively of @xmath68  41,000 and 70,000 . </S>",
    "<S> the detector was a -pixel ccd with 24-@xmath69 m pixels , which , to achieve complete spectral coverage , required four separate ccd positions . fortunately , the position chosen to address the compromises for maximizing radial - velocity ( rv ) precision ( the original purpose for the observations - the trade - off between spectral - line density , continuum flux and the ccd s efficiency ) , also recorded a useful fraction of the spectral lines often used for line - depth ratio analyses , allowing this subsequent research to be undertaken . </S>",
    "<S> this ccd position recorded wavelengths @xmath707200  and approximately 44 orders , @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were reduced using the hercules reduction software package ( hrsp v.2.4 ; skuljan 2004 ) which incorporates standard procedures , including background subtraction and cosmic ray filtering , normalization using quartz - lamp flat - field spectra following careful continuum - level definition , and wavelength calibration using a th - ar lamp . </S>",
    "<S> the flux weighted mid - time of the stellar exposures were determined using an exposure meter . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding dispersion solution for each observation was determined using th - ar spectra obtained immediately before and after the stellar spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the complete reduction created one - dimensional spectra having a wavelength range in the red ( where our line - ratio lines are located ) of about 50 .    </S>",
    "<S> many of our spectra were previously introduced in ramm ( 2004 ) , when the conjectured planet was first mentioned , with an extended set provided in when the first detailed study was reported . since then </S>",
    "<S> , it has been decided that 18 of the 2009 paper s spectra are of dubious quality for precise rvs and , making no significant difference to the results to be now described , are here rejected . </S>",
    "<S> the reasons for these rejections were based on careful inspection of the author s observing logbook which identified several nights with suspiciously undesirable observing conditions including very poor atmospheric seeing ( worse than about @xmath72 ) , th - ar lamp malfunctioning and failing that night , poorly timed th - ar calibration spectra , and/or significant observatory - control malfunctions ( such as poor dome tracking ) . also , significantly , the rvs of some other target stars on some of these nights also had atypical , non - random behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been realised that an additional 21 spectra had been acquired in 2007 but overlooked for the 2009 paper and here included . hence </S>",
    "<S> , a total of 225 spectra are analysed and discussed in this paper ( 215 with @xmath73 , ten with @xmath74 - the latter purely for the brief purpose of comparison of the ldrs with resolving power ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the utility of ldrs is their ability to provide a temperature scale of extraordinary precision . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , to calibrate the temperature scale as large a set as possible of spectra acquired with the same instrumentation and identically reduced is required . </S>",
    "<S> given the significant influence of stellar evolution on ldrs ( as the cited papers in the introduction indicate ) , the calibration stars must have a similar evolutionary status ranging over an adequate temperature range with the target star s somewhere midway within that range so that reliable interpolation of temperature , rather than less reliable extrapolation , is possible . </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate the expected temperature variation for based on its photometry and effective temperature given in . assuming the primary star is not pulsating , the stefan - boltzmann law predicts a corresponding temperature variation of about @xmath75  k. thus , a set of calibration stars that have temperatures ranging over @xmath76  k or so will be adequate ( exceeding @xmath77 by 2 orders of magnitude ) .    </S>",
    "<S> once again fortuitously , an adequate set of such spectra were discovered from past observations with and the  detector . </S>",
    "<S> these had also been observed during 20012007 with the -ccd and all at @xmath73 , and had been acquired for the various purposes of rv templates for sb2-spectra and rv - zero - point and rv standard - star analyses ( ramm 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , whilst sometimes a given star had only one spectrum available , it was usually of moderate  high signal - to - noise ( @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> some properties of the 20 stars identified for this calibration task , together with , are provided in . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 magnitudes and ( @xmath79 ) colour indices are from mermilliod ( 1991 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the parallaxes used to derive the absolute magnitudes , , are from van leeuwen ( 2007 ) except for @xmath8  ret and whose parallaxes were determined with higher precision in   that for is nearly @xmath80 more precise . the photometric variability , @xmath81 , </S>",
    "<S> is taken from observations ( esa 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was reviewed as a guide to identifying potentially unsuitable stars where only a small number of spectra were available but which may have had undesirable variability that was not adequately sampled with our observations . </S>",

    "<S> there are two significant periods we are searching for evidence of in our ldrs : 1.that of the @xmath7  day rv perturbation , , and 2.the rotational period of the primary star , , which also remains uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> our estimate for the latter is little different from the value derived by since both costa ( 2002 ) and more recently fuhrmann & chini ( 2012 ) propose the same value for @xmath313 , but neither assign an error to it . </S>",

    "<S> requires @xmath317 . </S>",
    "<S> if a reliable period can be found from our ldr analysis it might at least resolve this uncertainty .    </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out , lomb - scargle periodograms of the 24 ldrs revealed no evidence of any particular period consistently having a significant power exceeding the noise , and certainly not in the vicinity of ( @xmath318  days ) or ( see ) . </S>",
    "<S> twenty - one ratios have their peak power at a period @xmath319  days and these have an average of @xmath320  days . in the vicinity of ( @xmath321  days ) there are two ratios whose peak power falls in this range ( @xmath322 and @xmath323 ) , both having a period of about @xmath324  days .    the results for the six ratios provided in have been chosen to illustrate three with high scatter and three with low scatter . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio distributions , @xmath325 and @xmath326 , correspond to the two resolving powers @xmath327 used . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter is largely a result of the quotient calculation , so if the ratio was inverted , the scatter would re - scale accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this feature has no other particular significance . </S>",
    "<S> another feature is that the difference between the means ( @xmath328 ) is quite highly correlated with either ratio . </S>",
    "<S> for instance with @xmath329 , @xmath330 : the low - scatter @xmath331 ratios have negative mean differences and the higher - scatter @xmath332 ratios have positive mean differences . </S>",
    "<S> with regards our intention to obtain high - precision temperatures , one more detail has more relevance : the ratio of the standard deviations of those means , @xmath333 , is approximately normally distributed , its mean being @xmath334 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there is apparently no significant advantage for the task of getting precise temperatures for with regards these ldrs and these two resolving powers . </S>",
    "<S> however , so as to avoid apparently unnecessary complications for only ten additional observations , as well as zero - point offsets that are nevertheless usually present , the lower resolving power spectra are no longer included in what follows .    </S>",
    "<S> support for our strategies used to derive the depths , ratios and their errors comes from a comparison of these values for our final 215 spectra : the standard deviation of each ratio s mean and the corresponding average error are about equal : ( @xmath335 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by noting that the behaviour of each line with regards to temperature is related to varying degrees to the same stellar properties that determine a star s position on an h - r diagram . </S>",
    "<S> these properties include its absolute magnitude , effective temperature , metallicity , age , mass , surface gravity and so on . </S>",
    "<S> when a simple approximate dependence ( typically represented by some low - order polynomial ) exists between the ldrs and , say , the temperature , the influence of other attributes create scatter about that polynomial fit . </S>",
    "<S> since the exact interaction of each of these properties with each other and the ldr still has some uncertainty associated with it , we can not hope to make an accurate allowance for any of them . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , more easily and accurately determined parameters are used such as the temperature guides @xmath16 and @xmath336 indices ( flower 1996 ; mcwilliam 1990 ; gray 1992 ; ramrez & melndez 2005 ) , whilst for a guide to evolution , they include surface gravities , and the parameter we have already discussed - and will use - the difference between the absolute magnitude and the zams magnitude , .    </S>",
    "<S> the strategy we use for the most part follows that described in catalano ( 2002 ) who studied dramatic spottedness of three recognized rs cvn - type active binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we will derive ldr - calibrated temperatures for all our stars , and , as a test of our accuracy , also attempt to recover the original values . </S>",
    "<S> oneal ( 2006 ) has subsequently drawn attention to several concerns with regards this method when the stars have higher rotation , significant spottedness , cooler temperatures ( @xmath337  k  due to the contribution of tio molecular bands in the ldr wavelength range employed by catalano ) and inadquate spectral resolving power . </S>",
    "<S> we believe we will not be adversely affected by these important details as all our stars are expected to be inactive , non - spotted , slow rotators , and have @xmath338  k. our careful inspection of our lines behaviour with changing temperature give us confidence we have selected lines for which our methods are applicable .    for each ratio , we now plot the mean ldr for all 20 calibration stars with respect to their temperatures ( see for six typical examples , the same ratios shown in for ) . </S>",
    "<S> two fits were derived for each ratio s data , one linear ( since most ratios had this type of distribution ) and the second parabolic ( since a small fraction of our distributions were better fit with this function ) . </S>",
    "<S> after the analysis was carried through to its completion , it was evident that parabolic fits to the ldr - distributions actually gave less accurate temperature predictions for our calibration stars for all ratios . </S>",
    "<S> in fact this is not too surprising as ldr papers describing much wider ranges of @xmath16 ( and hence temperature ) ( strassmeier & schordan 2000 ; gray & brown 2001 ) , show essentially linear distributions in the range of our ldr and values . therefore , the analysis that follows always uses linear fits with consideration taken for errors in both coordinates ( press 2002 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> each calibration star , the regression - line temperature @xmath339 corresponding to each ratio was derived , and the mean temperature from all ratios ascertained . </S>",
    "<S> we can judge the accuracy of the temperature predictions from this first linear fit by comparing the means , @xmath340 , of our 20 calibration stars to their :    t = < t >  -  .    </S>",
    "<S> the mean absolute value is @xmath341  k ( see ) . </S>",

    "<S> this step brings our second h - r diagram coordinate into play . </S>",
    "<S> examples of two such distributions are given in . </S>",
    "<S> these two examples ( for @xmath398 and @xmath399 ) , which are close to the extremes for scatter , were chosen to show two other features : 1.the scatter of ldr residuals to varies considerably and is independent of the wavelength separation of the lines used for the ratio , and , 2.these and all other distributions have a small and positive slope indicating there is a remaining sometimes well - defined but incompletely - corrected correlation between the ldr and our evolution index . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the greater scatter of the distributions for some ratios represents their greater sensitivity to effects not yet adjusted for ( surface gravity , metallicity and so on ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two ratios with the highest scatter include the feline 6256   @xmath394 and @xmath395 . </S>",
    "<S> the next four highest scatters are for ratios including the fe line 6247 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter result is consistent with findings commented upon by catalano ( 2002 ) , whose two ldrs including this line ( @xmath400 and @xmath401 ) had such high gravity - dependence that they could not be used for all of their calibration stars . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , our ratio @xmath402 shows a very small scatter and catalano illustrated the tiny gravity effect this ratio has by the near coincidence of their main - sequence and giant star calibration curves .    </S>",
    "<S> this second linear fit provides the final step to our temperature calibration and is often referred to as a ` correction ' to the ldr , but we prefer to label it as a ` modification ' . </S>",

    "<S> now @xmath403  k , which is slightly better than half the corresponding value given in from the ldrs , and serves as an indication of the final accuracy of the temperature scale we will apply to our analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the mldr for each observation was created using and these converted via the calibration - star - regression to the 5160 temperatures for our 215 spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the calibration - star - regression slopes , @xmath384 , and temperature differences between our and @xmath404 values , @xmath405 , are added to . </S>",
    "<S> the differences @xmath405 are significantly reduced .    before proceeding </S>",
    "<S> it is now appropriate to review all the ratios and decide if any can justify rejection . </S>",
    "<S> most of the papers we cite comment upon the presence of ratios they deem suitable for rejection initially or as their analyses progess . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the metallicity dependency of lines and their ratios is a function of the degree of their saturation , weak lines having almost no metallicity dependence ( gray 1994 ) . </S>",
    "<S> since we have made no adjustment for metallicity , we might expect our ratios using a more saturated line ( such as at 6253 ) might yield poorer accuracy and so warrant rejection . </S>",
    "<S> this dependency is not evident from our results and helped us decide not to include a metallicity adjustment for our ldrs . </S>",
    "<S> however , two ratios , @xmath394 and @xmath395 , were identified in our ldr analysis as having the least accuracy recovering the original -calibrated temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this weakness continues with the mldrs . </S>",
    "<S> the other 22 ratios have a fairly tight mean standard deviation for the calibration - star temperatures of @xmath406  k , whereas @xmath407  k , or at least 7 , for these two less accurate ratios ( see ) . </S>",
    "<S> they are therefore discarded from the final analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> as the @xmath408 values in demonstrate , there are zero - point offsets between the regression - line temperatures ( @xmath404 , using the solid lines as in ) from our remaining 22 ratios ( @xmath409  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean temperature for each observation from these ratios was calculated without any arbitrary zero - point adjustment . </S>",
    "<S> this decision is the only sensible one given our goal to assess the likely true variability of our dataset . </S>",
    "<S> adjusting for the offsets can be expected to only unfairly reduce the scatter . </S>",
    "<S> the mean temperature from the 22 ratios , @xmath410  k , is consistent with the published effective temperature ( fuhrmann & chini 2012 ) who found @xmath411  k. it is also consistent with the accuracy of our mean regression - predicted temperatures of our 20 calibration stars , @xmath380  k , as mentioned above . the mldr - calibrated temperatures for the 215 spectra , now taking the weighted mean of the 22 ratio temperatures for each spectrum , are illustrated in . </S>",
    "<S> their standard deviation is only 4.2  k. not surprisingly , given the lack of support for any significant periodicities in our original ldrs ( see ) , once again a lomb - scargle periodogram reveals no significant power above the general noise at any period .    </S>",
    "<S> our results so far provide no evidence for significant surface temperature variations that are presumably essential evidence of either spots or pulsation to be the cause of the @xmath7  day rv - perturbation of @xmath1 octantis . </S>",
    "<S> another diagram provides further evidence , this time pushing our claims back to the observations of ( esa 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume is not pulsating @xmath412 , we can derive the corresponding magnitude variations , @xmath413 , using @xmath414 . </S>",
    "<S> we create ratios of all our mldr temperatures with their weighted mean @xmath415 . </S>",
    "<S> since the bolometric correction can be sensibly assumed to be constant for our tiny temperature variations , and the challenging decision of how to define the stellar radius disappears with the ratio , returning to the stefan - boltzmann law , @xmath416 , we have    m = -10  ( )  . </S>",
    "<S> these values are plotted in together with the @xmath413 values derived from the observations , @xmath417 , where @xmath18 is given in , and both datasets are shifted to the same zero - point @xmath418 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of mldr - predicted magnitudes of course duplicates the temperature distribution in ( though now inverted as a cooler temperature corresponds to a more positive magnitude ) . </S>",
    "<S> the striking similarity of our @xmath413 magnitudes to the magnitudes implies the primary star of has the same distribution of brightness variations as it did @xmath419  years previously . </S>",
    "<S> this useful result further justifies extending our analysis from one of only ldrs to the more complex one that has converted the ldrs to temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness variation is very sensitive to the temperature ratio : increasing the temperature range by one degree increases the magnitude range by about one millimag , so even increasing @xmath77 by a mere 10  k would make a significant change to our @xmath413 distribution . </S>",
    "<S> such a close match for this high - precision behaviour seems highly unlikely to be coincidental  presumably the star is behaving the same way in 20012007 as it did from 19901993 .    </S>",
    "<S> variability amongst k - giants is well recognized , with many having photometric and rv periodicities of several hundred days and rv semi - amplitudes up to and sometimes in excess of 100(walker 1989 ; cummings 1999 ; henry 2000 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rv period can be comparable to the k - giant rotation period and this detail alone should sound alarm bells for the controversial planet . noted this detail , but also that the @xmath420 position of places it neatly in the space of more typically ` rv - stable ' k giants ( @xmath421 ; see henry 2000 , hekker 2006 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate the likelihood of pulsations based on our ldr results .    by integrating the near - sinusoidal perturbation rv curve we can estimate the change to the star s radius based on the semi - amplitude and period @xmath422  days . </S>",
    "<S> a highly eccentric orbital solution argues in favour of a planetary cause ( see the case for the k2  iii @xmath57  dra ; frink 2002 ) , but the small non - zero eccentricity calculated for the conjectured planet ( @xmath423 ) is no obstacle . also , have assumed their rvs fit a keplerian orbit ( which in any case may be a significant over - simplification ) , so it is not surprising that some non - zero eccentricity has been derived . </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath424 and therefore @xmath425 , where @xmath426 is a projection correction factor for estimating the pulsation velocity amplitude ( nardetto 2006 ) . for @xmath39 in , @xmath427 . </S>",
    "<S> so for every increment of 10with , the predicted change to the star s radius is about 0.1which acting alone corresponds to a brightness change of about 40  mmag . </S>",
    "<S> this is far in excess of any compensating contribution our small temperature variations could provide ( merely a few millimag ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the necessary temperature change to offset the brightness change with @xmath428 is about 40  k for every 10increase in . </S>",
    "<S> these temperature changes would have to be in - phase with the radius changes ( otherwise the brightness would be more variable ) , which itself is inconsistent with recognized classical pulsation behaviour where temperature changes typically significantly lag velocity changes ( see kurtz 2006 ; pugh & gray 2013 ) . thus , there is no support for conventional pulsations as the cause of the rv perturbation from our ldr analyses .    for starspots to cause the rv perturbation , the primary star would have to have those spots suitably distributed on the observer - facing pole , one spot group if the rotation period matched the perturbation period @xmath429  days , and two groups fortuitously separated by 180if @xmath430 , as noted . </S>",
    "<S> such ` fortuitous ' spot geometries have been identified in the active longitudes of other stars ( see jrvinen 2005 ; gray & brown 2006 ) . in any case , </S>",
    "<S> in we found @xmath431  days , and its published radius and @xmath29 ( see ) , at least imply is not likely to exceed 200  days .    </S>",
    "<S> but it is again not clear that our temperature variations , if now from spots , are capable of producing the rv perturbation unless we convert the temperatures to some estimate of spot geometry and subsequently rv behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> we define the filling factor @xmath432(% ) as the ratio of the total spot area @xmath433 to the visible hemisphere area @xmath434 . </S>",
    "<S> we can derive various equations in terms of @xmath435 and the unspotted photosphere temperature ( assumed to be the maximum observed ) @xmath436 , the integrated observed mean temperature @xmath437 when cooler spots are on the visible hemisphere , and the spot temperature @xmath438 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath437 and @xmath436 corresponds to the brightness variation @xmath413 . </S>",
    "<S> oneal ( 2006 ) discusses the difficulties inherent in calculating a ` meaningful ' average temperature when spots are involved . in any case , we have our empirical temperatures @xmath437 so calculating them is unnecessary . </S>",
    "<S> oneal also emphasises concerns for using ldrs to measure spot temperatures @xmath439  k. our analyses so far , and what now follows , suggests these particular concerns are not relevant here .    </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the filling factor in a relatively simple manner that should give sensible order - of - magnitude predictions of what we are now exploring . in the first place , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the spotted and unspotted luminosities , @xmath440 and @xmath441 respectively , is given by    & = & + & = & 1 -  . by application of the stefan - boltzmann law ( since again we assume @xmath412 ) we can then derive    = and = since @xmath442 also equals @xmath443 . </S>",
    "<S> allows estimation of @xmath432 when empirical temperatures are available such as we have from our mldr calibrations , and would show the filling factor changing in a non - periodic manner consistent with our temperature distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> is useful for estimating maximum @xmath432 when a given brightness constraint exists , such as we have demonstrated in . </S>",
    "<S> the standard deviation of the brightness variations from ( which can not be seriously questioned ) and our mldrs ( which are based on very precise temperatures and the sensible alternative @xmath412 ) are both @xmath444  mmag which bounds about 70 per cent of our mldr datapoints . </S>",
    "<S> extending the boundary to @xmath445  mmag includes 90 per cent of them . both limits </S>",
    "<S> are included in , which illustrates the variation of @xmath432 for three values of @xmath413 , a wide range of spot temperatures , and two photosphere temperatures @xmath436 including the maximum mldr - calibrated temperature we derived for , 4820  k. these two temperature curves demonstrate the influence of @xmath436 . </S>",
    "<S> each value for @xmath413 plotted in creates its corresponding estimate for @xmath432 . at these very low values for @xmath413 , @xmath432 is not very senstitive to @xmath436 .    </S>",
    "<S> with regards our plan to estimate spot - induced rv predictions , we utilise the work of hatzes ( 2002 ) , who also used a photosphere temperature of 6000  k. however , the hatzes analysis was specifically for cool spots on sun - like stars . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spottedness of a different nature can not be reliably assessed in what follows . for @xmath446  </S>",
    "<S> k , expected to be typical for many spots ( see biazzo 2006 ; oneal 2006 ) , each filling factor curve varies very little , and less so for greater @xmath447 . for any photosphere temperature @xmath448  k and @xmath449  mmag , we find @xmath432 does not exceed about 1% . </S>",
    "<S> the rv - amplitude prediction from hatzes ( 2002 ) for this low filling factor and @xmath313 is @xmath450 . </S>",
    "<S> also , is approximately proportional to @xmath29 for our model values , so an unrealistic increase to @xmath29 would be required to approach the order of magnitude of @xmath451 . </S>",
    "<S> that this signal is not evident in our temperature distribution , and hence neither in our predicted @xmath432 distribution ( there is no hint of the required rotation - modulated periodicity ) , and since our predicted spots seem incapable of producing the observed rv perturbation , supports  now quantitatively with data from the same time interval  the claim of that cool spots are unlikely to be the perturbation s cause .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper confirms the extraordinary temperature precision achievable from line - depth ratio analyses , in this instance for the k0  iii / iv primary star in the sb1 @xmath1 octantis . </S>",
    "<S> an important consequence is that the conjectured circumstellar retrograde planet of this unusually tightly bound system has further support . if it was nt for the close stellar companion , it would be unlikely that the planet would be in question given the range of standard tests so far applied and passed , and which now includes the sensitive but less frequently used ldr strategy .    </S>",
    "<S> twenty similarly - evolved calibration stars and 24 ratios from high - resolution spectra were examined resulting in a final set of 22 ratios providing very consistent results . when compared to temperatures derived from the intrinsic colours , our mldr - calibrated temperatures for both our calibration stars and , </S>",
    "<S> recover our original temperatures typically to within about 45  k. our final 215 temperatures for , spanning several years of observations ( 20012007 ) , predict @xmath452  k with a standard deviation of only 4.2  k. the published effective temperature is @xmath453  k ( fuhrmann & chini 2012 ) .    these results provide the first quantitative evidence that the primary star in @xmath1 octantis has no significant temperature variability during the six - year observation window . in particular , there is no evidence for any significant periodic behaviour in the ldrs anywhere near the star s expected rotation period @xmath431  days nor near the rv - perturbation s period , @xmath429  days , the latter suspected of being caused by a retrograde planet . </S>",
    "<S> when converted to brightness variations , our temperatures imply the star is unchanged since its very low - variablity observations by , @xmath419  years previously ( esa 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have also demonstrated a novel and revealing use of ldrs as a photometric gauge .    the ability of ldrs to examine a fundamental property such as temperature and its many ramifications , as we have initiated for the case of , should serve as a reminder that ldrs presumably deserve more widespread use to help elucidate the true nature of other exoplanet candidates , perhaps particularly but certainly not limited to those that are also controversial , challenged or extraordinary in some way .    these results more strongly support the conclusions of ramm that conventional spots and pulsations are unlikely to be the cause of s rv - perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> a prograde orbit has no stability , and the binary - secondary scenario proposed by morais & correia ( 2012 ) appears to be unsupported by the available orbital solutions . therefore the only recognizable astrophysical scenario continuing to be consistent with all available data is a retrograde planet ( ramm 2009 ; eberle & cuntz ( 2010 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the reality of a planet in this unusually tight binary system s geometry ( @xmath32  au , @xmath5 ) has more credibility and , for the time being , becomes that much more controversial .    </S>",
    "<S> our study appears to be sufficiently robust that it would seem difficult to explain the star s temperature stability if in the future surface dynamics were instead identified as the cause of s rv behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> such a result would imply that the rv behaviour is caused by a similarly unexpected cause , namely a new type of rv - creating surface process that has , in terms of our present knowledge , conflicting characteristics - namely be able to create a significant rv signal without any photometric , ldr nor bisector evidence .    </S>",
    "<S> of course new surface phenomena can be imagined to properly explain new empirical evidence . </S>",
    "<S> such an example of a variation of otherwise common stellar surface features ( namely sunpots and starspots ) are the low - contrast ` starpatches ' proposed by toner & gray ( 1988 ) </S>",
    "<S> . similarly , hatzes & cochran ( 2000 ) investigated the possibility of macroturbulent spots for the behaviour of polaris ( where the spot was distinguished by having a substantially lower macroturbulent velocity than the surrounding surface ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , predictions of such new phenomena have their own risks , since these can in turn be erroneous . for instance </S>",
    "<S> , in a detailed analysis of 51-peg spectra ( @xmath454 ) which included ldrs and bisectors , gray ( 1997 ) and gray & hatzes ( 1997 ) proposed that a better alternative to that planet ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) seemed to be a new mode of stellar oscillation in solar - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> however , using @xmath455 spectra , hatzes ( 1998 ) were able to help confirm the now - accepted reality of the planet </S>",
    "<S> . this should provide a warning for the challenges inherent in using even spectra with @xmath327 as high as for bisector and ldr analyses . of course , </S>",
    "<S> a large fraction of planets have been both supposedly confirmed and others refuted with spectra of only modest resolving power . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , hd166435 s planet was refuted in a frequently cited paper by queloz ( 2001 ) with spectra having only @xmath456 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed it remains unclear just what minimum resolving power is reliable for bisector and ldr studies in each instance , and , specifically , it remains to be proven if the spectra used by ramm ( 2009 ) for their bisector analysis , and again used here ( @xmath73 ) are in fact truly adequate to reveal the tell - tale evidence of a non - planetary cause . </S>",
    "<S> this detail perhaps remains the biggest obstacle for greater confidence that the extraordinary planet is real .    </S>",
    "<S> if proposals of new surface behaviour are possible for solar - type stars , it is surely possible for evolved stars about which we have less certain knowledge . </S>",
    "<S> however , if our increasing list of reasons to support the reality of the planet is confirmed , such as of the lack of suitable bisector and ldr variability with higher resolving - power spectra , should the controversial planet be later disproven by the discovery of another cause , it would presumably have serious implications for many exoplanet claims .    </S>",
    "<S> the challenges the system presents for its formation are formidable and challenging for long - term stability theories as well . </S>",
    "<S> but unless somehow discredited in the future , the system will be a prime motivator for studying such demanding geometries . </S>",
    "<S> besides being consistent with the debris - disk proposals in similar close binaries as mentioned in our introduction ( by trilling 2007 ) , perhaps the planet will be a suitable candidate for such histories as ` star - hopping ' , whereby a planet in a binary , rather than being ejected by collisions from a passing star or strong interactions from close stellar companions or an evolving stellar host , instead is exchanged between the stars ( see kratter & perets 2012 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an exchange may explain the proposed retrograde orbit . </S>"
