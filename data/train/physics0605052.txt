    "the swrs is particularly interesting since it is an atom - field geometry that leads to optical lattices having reduced periodicity .",
    "reduced period optical lattices have potential applications in nanolithography and as efficient scatterers of soft x - rays .",
    "moreover , they could be used to increase the density of bose condensates in a mott insulator phase when there is exactly one atom per lattice site . with the decreased separation between lattice sites ,",
    "electric and/or magnetic dipole interactions are increased , allowing one to more easily carry out the entanglement needed in quantum information applications @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the calculations of i , which were restricted to two - photon resonance of the raman fields , are extended to allow for non - zero raman detunings .",
    "there are several reasons to consider non - zero detunings . from a fundamental physics viewpoint ,",
    "many new effects arise .",
    "for example , one finds that , for non - zero detuning , it is possible to cool atoms to non - zero velocities , but only if _ both _ pairs of raman fields in the swrs are present , despite the fact that the major contribution to the friction force comes from atoms that are resonant with a _",
    "single _ pair of fields .",
    "this is a rather surprising result since it is the only case we know of where non - resonant atoms that act as a catalyst for the cooling .",
    "moreover , comparable cooling to zero velocity and non - zero velocities can occur simultaneously , but the cooling mechanisms differ .",
    "we also find effects which are strangely reminiscent of normal doppler cooling , even though conventional doppler cooling is totally neglected in this work . a dressed atom picture is introduced to simplify the calculations in certain limits",
    "; however , _ in contrast to conventional theories of laser cooling _ , nonadiabatic coupling between the dressed states limits the usefulness of this approach .",
    "the non - adiabatic transitions result from the unique potentials that are encountered in the swrs . to our knowledge",
    ", there are no analogous calculations of laser cooling in the literature .    from a practical point of view",
    ", there is also a need for calculations involving non - zero detunings .",
    "for example , in the quantum computing scheme proposed in @xcite , the raman frequency differs at different sites owing to the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field , making it impossible to be in two - photon resonance throughout the sample . as a result",
    ", one has to assess the modifications in cooling ( and eventually trapping ) resulting from non - zero detunings .",
    "the basic geometry is indicated schematically in fig .",

    "single _ photon transitions , nor do fields @xmath3 and @xmath24 ( or @xmath4 and @xmath23 ) drive raman transitions between levels 1 and 2 @xcite . on the other hand , the combined pairs of counter - propagating fields ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) _ do _ interfere in driving the @xmath27 raman transition and act as a _ standing wave _  raman field which , to lowest order in the field strengths , leads to a modulation of the final state population given by @xmath28 . in this manner , a grating having period @xmath29 is created .",
    "the friction force and diffusion coefficients are calculated using a semiclassical approach . for @xmath30 , they differ qualitatively from the corresponding quantities obtained in standard sisyphus cooling .",

    "the width of the @xmath111 components is similar to that found in sub - doppler cooling in magnetic fields ( milc ) @xcite ; in both milc and the swrs , the qualitative dependence for the friction coefficient as a function of @xmath99 is similar to that found in sub - doppler cooling using `` corkscrew '' polarization @xcite . as such , the curve is `` power broadened , '' since the effective field strength in the problem is @xmath118    it is tempting to consider the contribution to the friction force near @xmath119 as arising from the _ single _ pair of fields @xmath120 , since these fields are nearly resonant with the 1 - 2 transition in a reference frame moving at @xmath121 .",
    "tempting as it may be , this interpretation is wrong , since we have already shown in i that , for a single pair of raman fields , the friction force vanishes _ identically _ , regardless of detuning .",
