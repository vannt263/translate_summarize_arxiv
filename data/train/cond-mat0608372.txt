    "in the last fifteen years the magnetotransport of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , subjected to periodic potential modulations , has attracted considerable experimental and theoretical attention . for one - dimensional ( 1d ) modulations novel oscillations of the magnetoresistivity tensor @xmath3",
    "have been observed @xcite , at low magnetic fields @xmath4 , distinctly different in period and temperature dependence from the usual shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) ones observed at higher @xmath4 .",
    "these oscillations reflect the commensurability between two length scales @xcite : the cyclotron diameter at the fermi level @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the electron density , @xmath7 the magnetic length , and @xmath8 the period of the potential modulation .    the situation is similar but less clearcut for 2d electric modulations from both a theoretical @xcite and an experimental @xcite point of view .",
    "in general , for 2d modulations a tight - binding treatment shows that each landau level exhibits the well - known butterfly - type spectrum described by a harper - type equation .",
    "for sinusoidal modulations the energy spectrum resulting from the numerical solution of this equation shows , when the energy @xmath9 is measured in units of @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the modulation potential and @xmath12 the laguerre polynomial , a nontrivial structure as a function of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the flux quantum and @xmath15 the flux per unit cell : for @xmath16 rational , with @xmath17 integers and relative prime , each landau level is split into @xmath18 subbands @xcite . to our knowledge , despite various efforts @xcite there is no conclusive experimental evidence for this structure yet presumably because the small gaps between these subbands are closed due to disorder in samples of not exceptionally high mobilities . by neglecting those small gaps we recently accounted @xcite for the observed @xcite oscillations in the amplitude of the commensurability oscillations , as a function of the flux through the unit cell of the 2d modulation lattice , that could not be fully explained by earlier semiclassical theories @xcite .",
    "the high resistivity peaks observed for @xmath0 integer were due to collisional contributions and show up only for short - period modulations .    in view of recent work on 1d magnetic modulations @xcite ,",
    "it is of interest to present a tight - binding treatment of 2d magnetic modulations in order to see the similarity and the differences between the former and the latter as well as between 2d electric and magnetic modulations .",
    "so far we are aware only of the work of ref .",
    "12 which considered only a 2d magnetic modulation and did nt show any spectra as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , we would like to present such a treatment when both types of modulations are present .",
    "the reason for considering the latter case is that from experimentally known methods of producing a _ magnetic _ modulation one expects that the magnetic @xcite or superconducting stripes @xcite , periodically placed on top of a 2deg , also act like electrical gates and induce an _",
    "electric _ modulation of the 2deg .",
    "as shown in our previous work on transport @xcite and the related band structure @xcite , the phase difference between the two 1d modulations can have important consequences and even suppress the _ weiss _",
    "oscillations ; this prediction was later confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "we show here that similar effects must occur for 2d modulations with a @xmath2 phase difference since the bandwidth at the fermi energy is nearly independent of the magnetic field and the commensurability oscillations of the diffusive contribution to the resistivity disappear .",
    "further , as for 1d modulations @xcite , the bandwidth at the fermi energy for a purely electric modulation oscillates , as a function of the magnetic field , in _ antiphase _ with that for a purely magnetic one .",
    "in addition , we show how a small broadening can close the very small gaps in the density of states for @xmath19 rational .    in the next section",
    "we derive the relevant harper - type equations and solve them exactly , for @xmath0 rational , and analytically , for @xmath0 integer , to obtain the one - electron eigenfunctions and eigenvalues .",
    "we also present the density of states and the bandwidth at the fermi energy .",
    "various numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "iii and concluding remarks in sec .",
    "we consider a 2deg in the @xmath20 plane under a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath4 , modulated weakly and periodically along the @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions , and accompanied by a 2d electric modulation of the same period . in fourier space the total electric and magnetic fields can be expressed , respectively , by a vector potential @xmath23 and by a scalar potential @xmath24 here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the lattice periods of the imposed modulations and @xmath27 is the corresponding reciprocal lattice vector with @xmath28 integers . for @xmath29 , which can be satisfied in most practical situations , we have @xmath30 and the magnetic field reads @xmath31 with @xmath32 the fourier component of the magnetic modulation .    neglecting the spin of the electron and the zeeman term , the one - electron hamiltonian of the 2deg reads @xmath33^{2}/2m^{\\ast}+v(\\mathbf{r } ) \\\\ \\nonumber & = & p_x^{2}/2m^{\\ast } + ( p_y+ebx)^{2}/2m^{\\ast } + \\frac{e}{m^{\\ast } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{g}}e^{i\\mathbf{g}\\cdot r}(a_{\\mathbf{g}}^{x}p_x+a_{\\mathbf{g}}^{y}p_y + ebxa_{\\mathbf{g}}^{y } ) \\\\ & & + \\frac{e^{2}}{2m^{\\ast } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{g}}d_{\\mathbf{g}}e^{i\\mathbf{g}\\cdot r}+\\sum_{\\mathbf{g}}v_{\\mathbf{g}}e^{i\\mathbf{g}\\cdot r},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the momentum operator , @xmath35 is the square term of the vector potential , and @xmath36 is the fourier transform of the electric potential .    in the absence of both modulations , i.e. , for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the system has an energy spectrum of landau levels @xmath39 . in the landau gauge ,",
    "the corresponding wave functions are @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the normalized harmonic oscillator function .",
    "constraining the center of the cyclotron orbit @xmath44 to be within the sample and using periodic boundary condition along @xmath22 , gives the degeneracy of the landau levels as @xmath45 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 the sample dimensions .",
    "we choose n to be an integer .      in the presence of",
    "_ weak _ 1d modulation , when coupling between different landau levels due to modulation is negligible , the landau levels are broadened into bands and their bandwidth oscillates with the uniform field @xmath4 .",
    "the eigenstates of the system and its energy spectrum can be calculated using perturbation theory @xcite or following a tight - binding treatment @xcite .",
    "for 2d modulations , the situation is much more complicated and in general the eigenstates can not be the same as those without modulation .",
    "a tight - binding method @xcite used by hofstadter @xcite to treat a 2deg with strong electric modulation but weak perpendicular magnetic field results in a `` butterfly''-type energy spectrum . neglecting coupling between different landau levels",
    ", we can express the new eigenstates as linear combinations of the states without modulation for each landau level @xcite . in the following",
