    "the issue of absorption in seyfert nuclei is one that has motivated a great deal of research .",
    "for example , studying the absorbing gas in seyfert  2s offers the most straightforward means for learning about the putative molecular torus surrounding the central engine , which is a cornerstone of the unified model for seyferts ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "these studies are also pertinent to research aiming to discover the source of the cosmic x - ray background radiation . in both of these cases ,",
    "a key issue is to understand the distribution of absorbing column densities of the seyfert population .",
    "a recent study by risaliti , maiolino & salvati  ( 1999 ) reported that roughly half of seyfert  2s have ` compton - thick ' intrinsic absorption columns ( @xmath6  @xmath2 ) , a fraction that is higher than indicated by earlier studies that were biased toward bright x - ray sources .",

    "statistically acceptable fits can also be achieved using models consisting of power laws plus iron lines absorbed by the galactic column densities and partial - covering ( intrinsic ) absorption columns ( model  e ) . like reflection models , partial covering is also often found to be important in the spectra of seyferts with obscuration .",

    "iron k@xmath0 lines are produced through the reprocessing of primary x - rays and become strongest in equivalent width when the primary x - ray continuum is suppressed in the neighborhood of 6.46.97  kev .",
    "the large iron k@xmath0 equivalent widths ( greater than 1.5  kev ) and flat apparent spectral continua ( see section 2.2 ) that we observe in  and   indicate that reprocessing is important in these sources ( e.g. matt , brandt & fabian 1996 ) , a deduction which seems to be confirmed by the good fits of the spectra that we achieved using compton - reflection models ( model  d ) .",
    "the large reflection scaling factors in those fits indicate that the reflected components dominate any direct components of the nuclear emission to a great extent .",
    "we achieved equally good fits , however , using partial - covering models .",
    "we must therefore discriminate between the two models based on physical arguments .",
    "matt et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) describe two reprocessing mechanisms that can be significant in seyferts , both of which can produce very strong iron  k@xmath0 emission . in the first case ,",
    "the iron emission occurs at the inner surface of the circumnuclear absorbing material ( the putative torus ) .",
    "the viewing angle can be such that the central source is obscured but the inner wall of the torus is not . in this case , predominantly neutral emission is expected and iron  k@xmath0 equivalent widths can be up to a few  kev .",
    "our model  d is entirely consistent with this theoretical mechanism .",
    "the second scenario places the iron emission in optically thin gas in the nuclear region ( the ` warm mirror ' ) .",
    "as long as the direct x - ray emission is obscured , the iron  k@xmath0 equivalent width can be as high as a few  kev , but in this case the line is expected at higher energies ( 6.76.97  kev ) , representing emission from very highly ionized iron . if we interpret the partial - covering column densities as representing absorbing gas along some lines of sight through the scattering regions , our model  e is consistent with this scenario , _ except for the energies of the iron  k@xmath0 lines_. these energies are inconsistent at greater than the 90% confidence level with emission from the highest ionization states of iron .",
    "thus we can conclude that a scattered component is not highly significant in the spectra of either  or .",
    "based on these considerations , it is likely that we are primarily seeing reprocessing by the inner surface of a circumnuclear absorber ( torus ) . in order to get the large equivalent widths we observe ( greater than 1.5  kev ) , however , an absorption column density is required that is significantly larger than the intrinsic column densities indicated by model  e. a column density of @xmath66  @xmath2 ( of the order we fit in  and ) absorbs only @xmath67% of the x - ray flux at 6.4  kev . to get such a large equivalent width in the 67  kev range , the intrinsic absorption along a direct line of sight to the x - ray source must be essentially compton - thick ( e.g. matt et  al . 1996 ) .",
    "we have also analyzed  data for  and  in order to check for flux variability between the  and  observations of these objects .",
    "was observed by the   pspc on 23  july  1992 ( rush & malkan 1996 ) , and  appears in the  hri field of sn1990w , which was observed on 1112  september  1995 .",
    "hence the variability timescales we are probing are roughly 5  years and 2  years , respectively .",
    "significant low - energy variability would place a constraint upon the size of the scattering / reflecting regions . based on our analysis of the data and the @xmath68 for  quoted by rush & malkan ( 1996 ) , however , we find no evidence for significant variability between the  and  observations of either source .",
    "the fluxes are consistent to within the cross - calibration uncertainties of the detectors ( e.g. iwasawa , fabian & nandra 1999 ) .",
    "we now consider additional evidence supporting the conclusion that the primary nuclear sources in  and  are completely obscured in the  band .",
    "mulchaey et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported correlations between @xmath60}$ ] ( see table  3 ) and @xmath69 for seyferts .",

    "these numbers fall well outside the @xmath71 and @xmath72 ranges , respectively , of even the seyfert  2 relationship ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "this provides further support for the obscuration of most of the direct x - rays from these sources below 10  kev , strengthening the conclusion that the intrinsic absorption in these galaxies is compton - thick . to emphasize this point ,",

    "1997 ) , and we compare these to the observed values of @xmath69 . using the table  3 fluxes , we obtain values of @xmath73 for  and @xmath74 for  for the ratios of predicted to observed fluxes .",
    "we note that this is a somewhat conservative estimate for , to which we might also justifiably apply the seyfert  1 relationship .",
    "although the optical properties of  support a seyfert  1 or intermediate nature ( see section  1 ) , its inferred absorption column density and iron k@xmath0 line are more like those of seyfert  2s .",
    "it seems clear that in the case of this object , the simplified picture of a type  1 or type  2 nature falls somewhat short of the truth .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that  is a compton - thick seyfert ; this seems to be the only plausible explanation for its observed x - ray properties . the combination of its type  1 optical properties with this heavy intrinsic absorption marks it as a member of a peculiar class of objects .",
    "it may well serve as a nearby archetype for the heavily obscured type  1 objects recently found in deep x - ray surveys ( e.g. comastri et  al .",
    "2000 ; also see brandt , laor & wills 2000 ) . as we have only placed a lower limit on the intrinsic absorption column in this object , we point out that the remaining uncertainty in its actual value should be resolvable by an observation further into the hard x - ray band by a satellite such as @xmath75 . finally , we comment that the existence of type  1 objects with heavy x - ray obscuration , such as  and broad absorption line qsos ( e.g. gallagher et  al .",
    "1999 ) , should give pause to those who would classify an object as type  2 based solely on a hard x - ray spectrum .",
