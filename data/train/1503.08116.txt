    "interpolation , which deals with the construction of a function in continuum from its availability in a finite set of points , is a rather old problem dating back to ancient babylon and greece . in view of its increasing relevance in this age of ever - increasing digitization",
    ", it is quite natural that the subject of interpolation is receiving more and more attention .",
    "consequently , a multitude of different interpolation schemes are being developed and reported in various places in the literature .",
    "however , in times where all efforts are directed towards construction of smooth functions , the fact that many experimental and natural signals are ",
    "rough \" having a dense set of nondifferentiable points or even nowhere differentiable was easily ignored .    in 1986",
    ", barnsley @xcite introduced the idea of fractal interpolation function ( fif ) aiming at data that require a continuous representation with `` high irregularity '' .",
    "in words of barnsley : ..... ( these functions ) appear ideally suited for approximation of naturally occurring functions which display some kind of geometrical self - similarity under magnification , for instance , profiles of mountain ranges , tops of clouds and horizons over forests , temperatures in flames as a function of time , electroencephalograph pen traces and the minute by minute stock market index . in 1989 , barnsley and harrington @xcite provided a seminal result on differentiability of fractal functions , one which initiated a striking relationship between fractal functions and traditional nonrecursive interpolants , and lead to the creation of a subject which is now called fractal splines . since then , many researchers have contributed to the theory of fractal functions by constructing various types of fifs , including hermite or spline fifs ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , hidden variable fifs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , multivariate fifs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an operator theoretic formalism for fractal functions which enabled them to find extensive applications in various classical branches of mathematics was introduced and popularized by navascus @xcite .    in spite of about a quarter century of its first pronouncement , fifs were extensively investigated only in terms of their algebraic and analytical properties such as fractal dimension , hlder exponent , differentiability , integrability , stability , and perturbation errors .",
    "thus , these studies completely ignore one of the important properties of an interpolation scheme , namely , preserving shape inherent in the data . constrained control of interpolating curve",
    "is a fundamental task and is an important subject that we face in applications including computer aided geometric design , data visualization , image analysis , cartography .",
    "however , fractal functions are not well explored in the field of constrained interpolation .",
    "motivated by theoretical and practical needs , the authors have initiated the study of shape preserving interpolation and approximation using fractal functions ; see , for instance , @xcite . however , these researches concern about preserving the three basic shape properties , namely , positivity , monotonicity , and convexity . on the other hand ,",
    "there are practical situations wherein interpolating curves that lie completely above or below a prefixed curve , for instance , a polygonal ( piecewise linear function ) or a quadratic spline are sought - after .",
    "the current article can be viewed as a contribution in this vein .",
    "the impetus for the research direction reported here grew out of the works of qi duan et al .",

    "section [ icafw2sec3 ] is devoted to establish convergence of the rational cubic fractal spline .",
    "strategies to select the free parameters involved in the rational cubic fifs so that they render interpolating curves that lie below or above a prescribed spline ( piecewise defined function ) are enunciated in section [ icafw2sec4 ] . in section [ icafw2sec5 ]",

    "there are two approaches for constructing fractal interpolation functions .",
    "first method introduced by barnsley characterizes the graph of fif as an attractor of specifically chosen iterated function system , hence the graph of the fractal interpolant can be approximated by the  chaos game \" algorithm @xcite . in what follows ,",
