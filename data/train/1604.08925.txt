    "the nonlinear features of solitary waves in dusty plasmas have been of great importance over the last many years due to their wide range of applications in space , astrophysical and laboratory environments @xcite .",
    "dust grains are typically micron or sub - micron sized particles and are ubiquitous ingredients in our universe .",
    "the presence of charged dust grains in an electron - ion plasmas not only alter the characteristics of ion - acoustic solitary waves ( iasws ) but also generates new kind of modes , namely , dust - ion acoustic ( dia ) waves and dust - acoustic ( da ) waves .",
    "more than three decades ago , @xcite reported theoretically the existence of dia waves in a dusty plasma . later , in laboratory experiments , @xcite confirmed the existence of these waves . a large number of investigations on dia waves in multicomponent plasmas have been reported in the framework of sagdeev s approach as well as reductive perturbation technique .",
    "furthermore , in many observations it has been confirmed that superthermal particles exist in space plasmas @xcite and laboratory environments @xcite .",
    "these superthermal particles are described by lorentzian ( kappa ) distribution which is more appropriate for analysis of data rather than a maxwellian distribution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such distribution has been widely used to investigate various collective modes as well as nonlinear coherent structures like solitons , shocks , envelope solitons through the description of korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) , korteweg - de vries burgers ( kdvb ) and nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "there has also been a growing interest in investigating the nonlinear modulation of electrostatic waves in plasmas owing to their importance not only in space and astrophysical environments but also in laboratory plasmas . the modulational instability ( mi ) of nonlinear waves in plasmas",
    "has been a well - known mechanism for the localization of wave energy , which leads to the formation of bright envelope solitons .",
    "however , in the absence of instability , system s evolution can be in the form of dark envelope solitons .",
    "furthermore , due to a small plane wave perturbation , mi can have exponential growth which leads to the amplification of the sidebands , and thus break up the uniform waves into a train of oscillations .",
    "a large number of investigations on mi of electrostatic or electromagnetic waves can be found in the literature @xcite . to mention few ,",
    "the mi of obliquely propagating dia waves in an unmagnetized plasma containing positive ions , electrons and immobile dust grains was reported by @xcite .",
    "it was observed from the stability analysis that the obliqueness in the modulation direction has a profound effect on the condition of mi .",
    "they also observed the influence of ion temperature on the amplitude modulation of wave and noticed that wave stability profile may be strongly modified by ion temperature @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the influence of superthermal electrons and trapped ions on the obliquely propagating ion - acoustic waves ( iaws ) in magnetized plasmas . @xcite addressed the mi of ion - acoustic wave envelopes in a multicomponent magnetized plasma using a quantum fluid model .",
    "they observed that the dust density , the constant magnetic field and the quantum coupling parameter have strong effects on the growth rate of mi .",
    "also , the nonlinear propagation of dia wave envelopes in a three - dimensional magnetized plasma containing nonthermal electrons featuring tsallis distribution , both positive and negative ions , and immobile charged dust was investigated by @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    "the investigation of mi of diaws in a magnetized dusty plasma containing superthermal electrons has not yet been reported .",
    "our purpose in this investigation is to consider the propagation of dia wave envelopes in a magnetized dusty plasma containing cold positive ions and superthermal electrons .",
    "we have employed the standard multiple - scale perturbation technique to derive the nls equation .",
    "it was shown that in earlier investigations @xcite mi of ion acoustic waves is significantly influenced by the presence of superthermal electrons and growth rate is larger in the presence of more superthermal electrons .",
    "we have , however , investigated the combined effects of the external magnetic field , dust concentration and the superthermality of electrons on the mi of dia wave packets .",
    "it is shown that the superthermality of electrons ( via @xmath4 ) , the charged dust impurity and the external magnetic field shift the mi domains around the @xmath7 plane , where @xmath10 is the wave frequency and @xmath11 stands for modulational obliqueness .",
    "further , we have also studied the decay rate of mi by different plasma parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , the basic equations governing the nonlinear dynamics of dia wave envelopes in magnetized superthermal plasmas are presented and the three - dimensional nls equation is derived .",
    "the effects of various physical parameters on the existence of stable / unstable regions for the modulation of dia waves are investigated in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ section4 ] contains the summary and conclusions of our results .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of dia waves in a magnetized plasma consisting of superthermal electrons , cold positive ions and negatively charged immobile dust grains .",
    "the plasma is immersed in the constant magnetic field @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt a fluid model for the dynamics of dia waves in a magnetized plasma which consists of the continuity , momentum and the poisson s equations .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    where the superthermal electrons are given by the kappa distribution @xcite @xmath16^{-\\kappa+1/2}\\label{kappa - dist}.\\ ] ] the set of fluid equations - in nondimensional forms are written as @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the number densities of electrons and ions normalized by their equilibrium values @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , @xmath24 is the electric potential normalized by @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the ion fluid velocity normalized by the dia speed @xmath27 ) .",
    "the space and time coordinates are normalized by the debye lengh @xmath28 $ ] and the inverse of ion plasma frequency @xmath29 $ ] respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath30 is the ion gyrofrequency normalized by @xmath31 .",
    "the charge neutrality condition yields @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "next , in the small - amplitude perturbations , i.e. , @xmath34 , eq . reduces to @xmath35 where the coefficients are given by @xmath36 in order to derive the evolution equation for weakly nonlinear dia wave envelopes , we employ the standard multiple scale technique @xcite in which the coordinates are stretched as @xmath37 consider @xmath38 and @xmath39 as the state vectors which describe the state at a position @xmath40 and time @xmath41 .",
    "the perturbations from the equilibrium state @xmath42 and @xmath43 are considered by assuming @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the slow - scale dependence of all perturbed state enter via the @xmath46-th harmonic amplitude @xmath47 and @xmath48 given as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath10 and @xmath51 , respectively , represent the carrier wave frequency and the wavenumber . in order that @xmath21 , @xmath52 , @xmath24 etc .",
    "are all real , the state variables must satisfy the reality condition with respect to its complex conjugate parts .",
    "one should note that the transverse ( to the magnetic field ) velocity components @xmath53 and @xmath54 appear at higher order in @xmath55 than the parallel component @xmath56 .",
    "the anisotropy and higher order effects are introduced via strong magnetic field and gyro - motion of fluid respectively in the presence of weak perturbations @xcite .",
    "we substitute the stretched coordinates and the expansions given above into eqs . - , and collect terms in different powers of @xmath55 to obtain a set of reduced equations .",
    "thus , equating the coefficients for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we obtain the following first - order quantities in terms of @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 together with the linear dispersion relation @xmath62 from the second order reduced equations ( @xmath63 , @xmath58 ) , the following compatibility condition in terms of the group velocity of waves is obtained as @xmath64 we have depicted the variation of the carrier wave frequency [ eq . ] and the group velocity [ eq . ] against the carrier wave number @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig13d ] . from the upper panel",
    ", we find that as @xmath51 increases , the frequency @xmath10 increases and it approaches a constant value at higher @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 approaches @xmath31 ( ion plasma frequency ) as the spectral index @xmath4 increases ( i.e. , superthermality of electrons decreases ) .",
    "however , a reduction of the wave frequency is noticed with increasing values of the electron to ion number density ratio @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that as the number density of electrons increases , more electrons will flow out of the dust grains , i.e. , dust charge number decreases in order to maintain the quasineutrality .",
    "further increase of @xmath8 may eventually lead to the case similar to the dust free electron - ion plasma .",
    "thus , negatively charged dust impurity in the plasma with @xmath66 effectively increases the wave frequency .",
    "such dust impurity has also a significant effect on the group velocity of waves as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig13d ] ( see the solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "the group velocity of waves ( @xmath67 ) decreases with an increase in the wave number ( @xmath51 ) for different values of @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is very interesting to see that for smaller @xmath68 ( i.e , for larger wavelength ) , the group velocity reduces with an increase in @xmath8 , however , it increases with larger @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , an increase in the parameter @xmath4 leads to an enhancement of @xmath67 as @xmath69 .        for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ", we can determine the second order harmonic modes in terms of @xmath59 .",

    "we note that the amplitude modulation of dia wave envelopes typically depend on the coefficients of the nls equation ( [ em7 ] ) , which parametrically depend on the density ratio @xmath8 , the superthermality of electrons ( via @xmath4 ) as well as the intensity of the magnetic field ( via @xmath103 ) . inspecting the coefficients @xmath104 and @xmath101 , we find that @xmath105 , i.e.",

    "also , @xmath110 according to when @xmath111 .",
    "we will find that the key elements responsible for the mi are the ratios @xmath112 and @xmath113 together with their signs and magnitudes . considering a harmonic wave solution of eq .",
    "( [ em7 ] ) of the form @xmath114 with @xmath115 denoting the constant amplitude , one can obtain the following dispersion relation for the modulated dia wave packets @xcite .",
    "@xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively , denote the wave frequency and the wave number of modulation .",
    "the parameter @xmath119 is related to the modulational obliqueness @xmath11 which the wave vector @xmath120 makes with the resultant of @xmath121 and @xmath122 , i.e. , @xmath123 . from eq .",
    "( [ em11 ] ) , we find that there exists a critical wave number @xmath124 such that @xmath125 , the mi sets in either for @xmath126 , @xmath127 or for @xmath128 , @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "it is further found that a critical value of @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath130 also exists for the occurrence of @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the mi may occur either for @xmath126 , @xmath132 or @xmath128 , @xmath133 , i.e. , we have two cases :    * case i : when @xmath134 , the mi sets in for @xmath135 and for any value of @xmath11 in @xmath136 .",
    "* case ii : when @xmath1 , the mi sets in either for @xmath135 and @xmath137 or @xmath138 and @xmath139 .    from the subsequent analysis and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it will be clear that the case i is not admissible to the present study as there is no common region for which @xmath134 and @xmath135 are satisfied .",
    "so , we will focus only on case ii .",
    "it turns out that when the dia wave frequency is larger than the ion - cyclotron frequency @xmath103 , the mi is related to the obliqueness parameter @xmath11 , however , the instability disappears for @xmath134 .",
    "we numerically investigate different stable and unstable regions in the @xmath7 plane as shown in fig .",
    "we find that the charged dust impurity ( represented by the parameter @xmath8 with @xmath140 ) , the superthermal parameter @xmath4 and the gyrofrequency @xmath5 shift the stable / unstable regions around the @xmath7 plane . from panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    "it is clear that as @xmath8 increases , i.e. , as the number of charged dust grains decreases , a part of the instability region ( with @xmath139 ) shifts to a stable one and the region of stability in the @xmath7 plane increases .",
    "however , the instability region with @xmath137 increases slightly with increasing values of @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that when the obliqueness parameter @xmath11 is below its critical value @xmath141 , the presence of charged dust impurity in the plasma favors the instability of modulated wave packets . comparing panel ( c ) with panel ( a )",
    "we find that the superthermality of electrons ( with lower values of @xmath4 ) also favors the instability in the region with @xmath139 .",
    "the instability region with @xmath137 remains almost unchanged . from panels ( a ) and ( d )",
    "it is also evident that the external magnetic field significantly reduces the regions of instability both in the cases of @xmath139 and @xmath137 .",
    "the maximum growth / decay rate @xmath142=im @xmath143 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ em11 ] ) as @xmath144 provided @xmath145 is satisfied . the decay rate of mi is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for different values of @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , the effects of higher values of @xmath4 ( less superthermality ) suppresses the instability decay rate with cutoffs at significantly lower wave numbers of modulation ( see the solid and dotted lines ) .",
    "however , the decay rate becomes higher with increasing values of the the electron concentration ( or decreasing the dust concentration ) with cutoffs at higher @xmath9 ( see the solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "we find that in contrast to the unmagnetized plasmas , the effect of @xmath5 is to increase the cutoffs at higher wave numbers of modulation , however , the decay rate is slightly reduced ( see the solid and dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "we have investigated the amplitude modulation of dia wave packets in a magnetized multi - component plasma consisting of singly charged positive ions , superthermal electrons featuring kappa distribution and negatively charged immobile dust grains . using the multiple scale technique ,",
    "a nls equation is derived which governs the evolution of dia wave envelopes .",
    "it is shown that the both the dispersive and the nonlinear coefficients of the nls equation are significantly modified by not only the charged dust impurity and the external magnetic field but also by the superthermality of electrons .",
    "different stable and unstable regions under modulation are obtained in the plane of the carrier wave frequency ( @xmath10 ) and the obliqueness ( @xmath11 ) of modulation .",

    "the growth / decay rate of instability is also examined numerically with these plasma parameters .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    * starting from a set of fluid equations , the dynamics of weakly nonlinear , slowly varying dia wave packets is shown to be governed by a three - dimensional nls equation in which the additional dispersive terms ( leading to two more space dimensions in the equation ) appear due to the combined effects of the transverse perturbations and the external magnetic field .",
    "the fluid model with @xmath4-distributed electrons and stationary charged dusts is valid for the plasma parameters satisfying @xmath140 and @xmath106 . *",
    "the carrier wave frequency is seen to assume a constant value at large @xmath146 , and approaches the ion plasma frequency with increasing values of @xmath4 .",
    "the wave frequency @xmath10 and hence the group velocity @xmath67 get significantly reduced with higher values of @xmath8 . *",
    "the group velocity dispersion @xmath97 of the nls equation is always negative irrespective of the values of @xmath51 and the plasma parameters .",
