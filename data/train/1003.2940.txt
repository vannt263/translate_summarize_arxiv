    "in going from the outer crust of a neutron star towards the core of the star , one crosses the so - called inner crust .",
    "the baryonic density of the inner crust ranges from about @xmath0 @xmath1 to approximately @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 @xmath5 ) is the density of nuclear matter at saturation . we shall discuss the linear response of this system limiting ourselves to densities smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "according to the generally accepted theoretical description the inner crust consists , in this region , of a lattice of spherical nuclei immersed in a sea of free neutrons ( with a background of electrons ) @xcite . at these densities ,",
    "neutrons are expected to be superfluid , and the inner crust of a rotating star should be threaded by vortex lines .",
    "the presence of nuclei affects a number of thermal and transport properties of the inner crust , and in some astrophysical scenarios may influence the fast cooling of the star @xcite .",
    "it can also affect the vortex dynamics , leading to vortex pinning , which might be the explanation for the phenomenon of glitches , sudden changes observed in the rotational period of pulsars @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the degrees of freedom of nuclei and those of free neutrons has been considered by different groups at the mean - field level within hartree - fock - bogoliubov theory ( hfb ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is well known , however , that many - body effects can significantly modify the hfb results .",
    "several studies have found that the pairing gap in neutron matter is quenched by spin fluctuations @xcite , but results obtained in uniform matter can not be directly extrapolated to the actual case of the inhomogeneous inner crust . in fact , many - body effects in ( isolated ) atomic nuclei are strongly dominated by the coupling between single - particle and collective surface - like degrees of freedom .",
    "the exchange of surface modes between nucleons moving in time - reversal states close to the fermi energy gives rise to an @xmath7 interaction , which tends to enhance the pairing gap @xcite .",
    "only exploratory calculations have directly addressed the induced interaction in the inner crust , finding that the density fluctuations associated with the dynamics of the nuclear surface lead to a partial dequenching of the gap and to characteristic changes in the spatial dependence of the gap @xcite .    within this scenario",
    "it is of interest to investigate how the surface response changes from atomic nuclei ( negative value of fermi energy ) to the inner crust , where the neutron fermi energy lies in the continuum . in the present work we shall investigate the collective response of the nuclear surface by means of a microscopic calculation of the linear response of the system based on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) theory @xcite . as in most previous studies , we shall deal with this inhomogeneous system within the wigner - seitz approximation ( ws ) , enclosing the system in a spherical unit cell . in this way",
    ", we shall neglect the band structure associated with the coulomb lattice @xcite .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that the response to operators of the type @xmath8 or @xmath9_{jm}$ ] is very close to that found in neutron matter , in keeping with the fact that the nucleus occupies only a small fraction of the volume of the ws cell . however , in the following we shall focus on the modes which are specifically associated with the presence of the nucleus at the center of the ws cell . therefore , we shall study the response to the operator @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mean - field potential .",
    "in fact , @xmath10 is the genuine operator associated with collective surface modes , which appears naturally in the particle - vibration coupling hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "essentially the same results would be obtained using the density instead of the mean - field potential . in appendix",
    "b we also briefly consider the operator @xmath8 .    in this work we shall not consider the effects of superfluidity on the linear response .",
    "pairing correlations can affect considerably the low - lying part of the spectrum , not only because they smear the fermi surface leading to the partial occupation of single - particle states , but also because they can change the isotopic composition of the crust @xcite .",
    "we shall focus on the properties of giant resonances , which are not expected to be sensitive to pairing . within this context",
    ", we shall use in the calculations the favoured number of protons predicted by negele and vautherin @xcite , predictions which were worked out without pairing .",
    "we have anyway indicated in the text where one expects to see the main effects of pairing correlations .",
    "we start from a mean - field hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation , making use of the skyrme - type sly4 interaction @xcite and working on a grid with a mesh size of 0.1 fm .",
    "our calculation is in line with other studies previously performed by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "we impose that the single - particle wavefunctions vanish at the edges of the ws cell .",
    "we expect that within the selected density range the results should not be sensitive to the particular choice of the boundary conditions ( cf . also appendix a ) . for densities larger than those considered in this paper ,",
    "the ws approximation starts to break down , leading to a dependence on the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "we shall show results for two ws cells .",
    "the first one has a radius @xmath12= 33.1 fm and contains 1314 neutrons and 50 protons ( @xmath13sn ) , corresponding to nucleon density @xmath14 g @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) .",
    "far from the nucleus the density approaches the asymptotic density @xmath17 fm @xmath18 .",
    "the second one has a radius @xmath19 42.2 fm and contains 458 neutrons and 40 protons ( @xmath20zr ) , corresponding to the nucleon density @xmath21 g @xmath15 ( or @xmath22 ) and to @xmath23 @xmath5 .",
    "the number of protons and neutrons and the cell radius are an input to the hf calculation and have been taken from the results of negele and vautherin @xcite .",
    "they found that the favoured proton number is equal to @xmath24 in the lower - density part of the inner crust , changing to @xmath25 for densities larger than @xmath26 g cm@xmath18 .",
    "other authors have determined the isotopic composition of the crust using different energy functionals and different methods .",
    "in particular , systematic calculations have been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite including pairing correlations , neglected by negele and vautherin .",
    "the results of these studies have been summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . in most cases",
    ", one finds that the favoured proton number varies between @xmath28 35 and @xmath29 , becoming smaller ( @xmath30 ) in the deeper regions of the crust .",
    "these uncertainties are understandable , because typical energy differences between local minima in the energy as a function of the proton number at a given density are of the order of 10 kev / nucleon . in the following",
    ", we shall also consider the ws cell @xmath31sn , calculated with the same parameters as @xmath20zr , but for the different proton number @xmath25 instead of @xmath24 .",
    "the corresponding fermi energy for neutrons and protons are equal to @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev for @xmath13sn , and to @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 mev for @xmath20zr .",
    "we note that the potential reaches an almost constant value far from the nucleus , so that the continuum portion of the single - particle spectrum starts at about @xmath36 mev ( @xmath13sn ) and at @xmath37 mev ( @xmath20zr ) .",
    "the number of neutrons in bound orbitals is about the same in the @xmath13sn ( 126 bound neutrons ) and in the @xmath20zr ( 124 bound neutrons ) cases .    in fig.[ind hfrpa :",
    "fig 10 ] we show the mean - field potential @xmath38 in the two cases @xcite .",
    "the presence of the outer neutron gas leads to a more diffuse potential than that found in atomic nuclei .",
    "the neutron potentials can be parametrized as woods - saxon potentials , @xmath39 with the values @xmath40 -3.73 mev , @xmath41= -54.2 mev , @xmath42 fm , @xmath43 fm for @xmath13sn and @xmath40 -0.42 mev , @xmath41= -61.4 mev , @xmath44 6.42 fm , @xmath45 fm for @xmath20zr .",
    "we remark that the values of the radii are close to those of ordinary nuclei with the same number of bound nucleons ( 1.2 @xmath46 fm for @xmath47 ) .",
    "the extension of proton and neutron potentials is similar .",
    "the radius of @xmath20zr is close to the value calculated for the drip - line nucleus @xmath48sn ( cf . below section iii(c ) ) .",
    "we can use the value of the radius @xmath49 to estimate the typical oscillator frequencies associated with the mean - field potentials shown in fig.[ind hfrpa : fig 10 ] . using the expression @xmath50 ( which reduces to the usual estimate @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 )",
    ", one finds @xmath54 7.7 mev for neutrons ( using the number of bound neutrons , @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 5.3 mev for protons in @xmath13sn .",
    "taking into account that the effective mass @xmath57 associated with the hf potential increases the level spacing , one can estimate @xmath54 9.6 mev and @xmath56 6.6 mev , using @xmath58 0.8 ( the typical value of the effective mass associated with the sly4 interaction in the nuclear surface region ) .",
    "we note the small value of @xmath59 , associated with the low proton density .",
    "we have then calculated the excited states of the system performing a rpa calculation in configuration space , based on the hf mean - field .",
    "the residual interaction was taken as the second derivative of the energy functional , that is , it was calculated with the same two - body skyrme force which determines the mean - field .",
    "the only terms that were dropped in the p - h channel were the two - body coulomb and two - body spin - orbit .",
    "their importance was recently discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite for atomic nuclei .",
    "while they play a role in a detailed analysis of the experimental data , they hardly change the general properties of nuclear response .",
    "the resulting rpa phonons are classified according to their total angular momentum @xmath60 and parity @xmath61 , while the index @xmath62 runs over the states having the same spin and parity with increasing energy .",
    "we have tested the numerical scheme considering the case of ws cells without protons . in this case ,",
    "the nuclear potential is flat except at the edge of the cell , and the ws cell represents a portion of neutron matter .",
    "the calculated response can then be compared with the analytical results obtained in uniform matter .",
    "the corresponding results are collected in appendix a.",
    "as discussed in the introduction , in the present work we are particularly interested in the study of the dynamics of the nuclear surface .",
    "for this reason we shall study the response to the operator @xmath63 , for @xmath64=2 and 3 , where @xmath38 represents the hf potential calculated in the ws cell ( cf . fig .",
    "[ ind hfrpa : fig 10 ] ) .",
    "this operator is specifically sensitive to the nuclear surface . in the case of an isolated nucleus it leads to results similar to those obtained with the @xmath65 operator for both quadrupole and octupole modes . in the following",
    "we shall give a detailed discussion of the results obtained for the @xmath13sn ws cell .",
    "we shall then present the results associated with the @xmath20zr case . finally , we shall consider the evolution of the response in the sn isotopes with increasing number of neutrons , going from the closed - shell nucleus @xmath66sn to the drip - line nucleus @xmath48sn and then into the inner crust to the ws cells @xmath31sn and @xmath13sn .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:1364_response ] we show the hf and rpa strength functions of the operator @xmath10 in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels for the @xmath13sn ws cell .",
    "the bars indicate the solution of the discrete rpa equations , while the continuous lines are obtained folding the discrete response with a lorentzian function having a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) equal to 1 mev .    in order to satisfy the energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) within 93% we had to include single - particle states up to @xmath69 90 mev .",
    "the @xmath70 basis is composed by about 8000 states for the quadrupole response and by about 10000 for the octupole response ; these values are close to the limits of our computational possibilities . the fraction of the ewsr obtained by integrating the calculated quadrupole response up to a given energy is shown in fig . [ ewsr:1364sn ] as a function of energy .",
    "we notice that the main features of the low - lying part of the response can be obtained with a much lower value of @xmath71 .",

    "the strongest particle - hole transitions connect orbitals separated by two oscillator shells , and have an energy of approximately 14 mev , close to the value of @xmath72 estimated above .",
    "there is also a rather strong low - lying transition , @xmath73 , whose energy is about 5 mev .",
    "the energies and transition strengths associated with the strongest ( unperturbed ) neutron particle - hole transitions are collected in tables i ( quadrupole response ) and ii ( octupole response ) .",
    "they involve either bound states ( @xmath74 mev ) or states in the continuum ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the latter are found to be resonant states , that is quasibound levels whose wavefunction is concentrated in the interior of the nucleus .",
    "to show this we take a potential which is equal to the mean - field potential up to 30 fm and is constant and equal to @xmath76 from 30 fm to infinity .",

    "the intruder state @xmath96 lies rather close to the state @xmath97 , and the neutron part of the unperturbed response is characterized by strong peaks corresponding to transition energies of the order of @xmath98 ( quadrupole response ) or of the order of @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( octupole response ) , with a spreading caused by the width of the resonances . in other words , the strength function is determined to a large extent by the shell structure , as in atomic nuclei .",

    "the main effect of the nucleus is the decrease of the absolute value of the ewsr : the ewsr for @xmath179x is about 20% smaller than for @xmath13sn , due to the fact that in the latter about 150 neutrons are bound in the nucleus , and couple to the @xmath182 operator much less efficiently than the unbound neutrons .",
