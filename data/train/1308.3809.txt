    "by exposing an atom or molecule to an intense and short laser pulse it is possible , for instance , to release one of the outermost electrons to the continuum .",
    "this laser - ionized electron will move subsequently in a combined field formed by the time oscillating laser electric field and the residual atomic or molecular coulomb potential .",
    "the theoretical treatment of this non - perturbative laser - matter interaction represents a formidable task from a computational viewpoint , even for the simplest systems .",
    "there has been , however , important advances in the development of algorithms and the increasing availability of computational power have made it possible to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) numerically , but only in a restrictive range of field strengths and frequencies .",
    "consequently , approximate theories and alternative approaches still play an important role in both the solution of the problems under study and in the understanding of the main features of the laser - induced phenomena .",
    "one of the most important concepts and that it has driven the attosecond science was the discovery of the so - called coherent electron - ion collisions induced by a strong laser field , most commonly referred to as _ re - collisions _  @xcite .",
    "this idea evolved starting from the numerical experiments of schafer et al .",
    "the work of corkum  @xcite , indeed , built on earlier contributions  @xcite and it has in turn been widely used to classically model different laser driven phenomena .",
    "we can summarize the classical picture of strong - field - induced ionization electron dynamics as follows .",
    "once an atomic or molecular electron is freed to the continuum by the laser , it finds itself moving in the strong oscillating laser field .",
    "this configures the so - called strong field approximation , where the main assumption is that any influence of the atomic or molecular potential is neglected . using the classical equations of motion it is possible to show that , within one or few cycles after ionization , the oscillating electron can be driven back by the laser field to re - encounter the parent ion . at the time",
    "this re - encounter , commonly referred to as re - collision , takes place , the electron can initiate several phenomena : scatter elastically ( diffract ) , scatter inelastically ( excitation or multiple ionization of the parent ion or molecule ) , or radiatively recombine into one of the residual atomic or molecular ion s empty states ( if particular conditions are met , coherent harmonic radiation can be generated ) .",
    "the classical approach is usually known as the three - step model , or the simple man s model  @xcite .",
    "if the electron elastically rescatters , gains energy and continues its travel to the detector we talk about above - threshold ionization ( ati ) ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the ati phenomenon receives special attention due to the fact that the ati yield is highly sensitive to the so - called carrier envelope phase , and consequently it constitutes a very robust pulse characterization tool . on the other hand if the laser - ionized electron radiatively recombines with the exact same state that the electron has left from , then the phase of the emitted radiation is the same from one atom to another of the sample , leading to the generation of coherent radiation of multiple frequencies .",
    "this process is known as high harmonic generation ( hhg ) and it is the basis for the production of attosecond pulses amongst other uses ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    the rest of this contribution is organized as follows . in the next section we focus on the definitions of the functions used for the classical simulations of high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) driven by an ample of set of laser sources , ranging from the conventional ( spatially homogeneous ) to more complex ( spatially nonhomogeneous of different kinds , temporal synthesized and spatial and temporal synthesized ) ones , including different pulses envelopes .",
    "next we treat above threshold ionization ( ati ) in a similar way .",
    "finally we conclude with a short summary .",
    "we start by modeling high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) in atoms and molecules driven by sine - squared laser pulses .",
    "the mathematica functions corresponding to this case will be described in detail and for the rest of the presented cases we only point out the differences and similarities .",
    "we need a couple of initialization commands before to start the definition of the mathematica functions , namely , + setdirectory[notebookdirectory [ ] ] + and +   `` picture '' ]    it produces a plot in the screen of the laser electric field , with the corresponding units , axis , labels and boxes .",
    "the next function is named tiontrecsin2 and allow us to calculate the recombination times @xmath1 , defined as the time when the laser - ionized electron returns to the ion core , as a function of the ionization times @xmath2 , specified by the time when the bound atomic electron is put in the continuum due to the interaction with the laser electric field , by solving numerically the newton - lorentz equation of motion for an electron moving in an oscillating electric field .",
    "we employ the mathematica command ndsolve in order to solve the second order differential equation with the adequate initial conditions and the package rootsearch to find the times for which the electron returns to the parent ion , i.e. the recombination times .",

    "<S> a set of mathematica functions is presented to model classically two of the most important processes in strong field physics , namely high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) and above - threshold ionization ( ati ) . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on the numerical solution of the newton - lorentz equation of an electron moving on an electric field and takes advantage of the symbolic languages features and graphical power of mathematica . </S>",
    "<S> similarly as in the strong field approximation ( sfa ) , the effects of atomic potential on the motion of electron in the laser field are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the sfa has proven to be an essential tool in strong field physics in the sense that it is able to predict with great precision the harmonic ( in the hhg ) and energy ( in the ati ) limits . </S>",
    "<S> we have extended substantially the conventional classical simulations , where the electric field is only dependent on time , including spatial nonhomogeneous fields and spatial and temporal synthesized fields . </S>",
    "<S> spatial nonhomogeneous fields appear when metal nanosystems interact with strong and short laser pulses and temporal synthesized fields are routinely generated in attosecond laboratories around the world . </S>",
    "<S> temporal and spatial synthesized fields have received special attention nowadays because they would allow to exceed considerably the conventional harmonic and electron energy frontiers . </S>",
    "<S> classical simulations are an invaluable tool to explore exhaustively the parameters domain at a cheap computational cost , before massive quantum mechanical calculations , absolutely indispensable for detailed analysis , are performed .    </S>",

    "<S> + _ nature of problem : _ the mathematica functions model high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) and above - threshold ionization ( ati ) using the classical equations of motion of an electron moving in an oscillating electric field . in strong field physics hhg and ati represent two of the most prominent examples of the non - perturbative interaction between strong laser sources and matter . in hhg an atomic or molecular bound electron is put into the continuum by the external laser electric field . due to the oscillatory nature of the electromagnetic radiation </S>",
    "<S> , the electron is steered back and recombines with the parent ion converting its kinetic energy as high energy photons . </S>",
    "<S> for ati the electron is laser - ionized in the same way as in hhg , but in its return it is elastically rescattered by the parent ion gaining even more kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate functions for different laser pulse envelopes , namely sine - squared , gaussian , trapezoidal and numerically defined by the user . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we relax the assumption of spatial homogeneity of the laser electric field , allowing weak spatial variations with different functional forms . </S>",
    "<S> finally we combine spatial and temporal synthesized laser fields to produce hhg and ati . </S>",
    "<S> for all the cases the functions allow the extraction of pre - formatted graphs as well as raw data which can be used to generate plots with other graphical programs . </S>",
