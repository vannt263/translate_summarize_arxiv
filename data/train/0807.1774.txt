    "studies of collective phenomena at nanoscales in dense matters are of great importance in diverse areas of physics , including the fields of plasmonics @xcite , semiconductors @xcite , nano - electromechanical systems @xcite , quantum - diodes @xcite , nanotubes and nanowires @xcite , quantum free electron lasers @xcite , as well as astrophysical bodies @xcite and intense laser - solid density plasma interaction experiments @xcite for x - ray and @xmath0-ray sources . in dense plasmas ,",
    "the electrons are highly degenerate and quantum mechanical effects ( e.g. electron tunneling arising from the finite width of the electron wave function ) play an essential role at nanoscales .",
    "since degenerate electrons follow the fermi - dirac statistics , there appear new electron equation of state and new forces involving the quantum bohm potential @xcite and electron-@xmath1 spin effects @xcite in dense quantum plasmas .",
    "it then turns out that due to the intrinsic nonlinearities associated with the fermi pressure law and quantum forces , there exists possibility of localizing electrostatic @xcite and electromagnetic @xcite wave energies at nanoscales in dense quantum plasmas . here",
    "we report simulation studies of three - dimensional ( 3d ) electron fluid turbulence at nanoscales in an unmagnetized warm dense plasma . it is found that 3d nonlinearly interacting electron plasma oscillations ( epos ) @xcite in a dense quantum plasma exhibit nano - structures and associated energy spectra that are markedly different from those reported earlier for the 2d case @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we stress that the present 3d turbulence properties of electron plasma oscillations in our dense quantum plasma are significantly different from those in a classical plasma @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "strong electron plasma wave turbulence has been studied by invoking parametric interactions @xcite and by using either multi - dimensional cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite or zakharov equations @xcite , which are different from our 3d coupled nonlinear schrdinger - poisson equations in dense quantum plasmas .",
    "the surge for studying numerous nonlinear processes in dense quantum plasmas lies in a hope to transfer information through localized nano - structures one is able to create and sustain in plasmas .",
    "the present work dealing with 3d electron fluid turbulence shares a great deal of knowledge with classical fluid turbulence @xcite , plasma turbulence @xcite , and superfluid turbulence involving the bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite in ultracold gases .",
    "both in fluids and plasmas as well as in becs , one encounters the phenomena of inverse energy cascades in which energy transfer from small scales sustains large scale circulations / structures in the flow , and results in a steady - state inertial range with power - law scaling , as was originally predicted by kolmogorov , kraichnan and iroshnik @xcite .",
    "while the dynamical equations depicting inverse cascades in fluids and plasmas are the navier - stokes and charney - hasegawa - mima equations @xcite , the energy cascade scenario in becs is described by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite . in sec",
    "ii , we describe model equation governing the dynamical evolution of 3d dense fermi quantum plasma .",
    "we also present conservation laws admitted by the set of 3d equations . in sec iii ,",
    "nonlinear 3d simulation results describing turbulence in such system are described .",
    "mode structures and corresponding kolmogorov - like spectra are also discussed .",
    "turbulence transport is described in sec iv , and finally the conclusions are contained in sec v.",
    "in dense quantum plasmas , the wigner - poisson ( wp ) model has been used to derive a set of quantum hydrodynamic ( qhd ) equations @xcite in the mean field approximation .",
    "the qhd equations include the continuity , momentum and poisson equations .",
    "the quantum nature appears in the electron momentum equation through the pressure term , which requires knowledge of the wigner distribution for a quantum mixture of electron wave functions , each characterized by an occupation probability satisfying the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the quantum part of the electron pressure is represented as a quantum force @xmath2 , where the bohm potential is @xcite @xmath3 . here",

    "the electrostatic potential is determined from the poisson equation .",
    "we thus have the coupled nls and poisson equations , which govern the dynamics of nonlinearly interacting epos is a warm dense quantum plasma .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out simulations of 3d nls and poisson equations in order to understand the properties of 3d electron fluid turbulence ( involving nano - structures and associated electron transport ) in a warm dense plasma .",
    "we find that nonlinear couplings between different scales epos are responsible for creating small - scale electron density clumps , while the electrostatic potential assumes large - scale structures .",
    "the total energy associated with our 3d electron fluid turbulence at nanoscales processes a characteristic spectrum which is a _",
    "non- _ kolmogorov - like .    for our 3d electron fluid turbulence studies ,",
    "we use the nls ",
    "poisson equations @xcite @xmath11 and @xmath12 which are valid at zero electron temperature for the fermi - dirac equilibrium distribution . in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) the wave function @xmath13 is normalized by @xmath14 , the electrostatic potential @xmath15 by @xmath16 , the time @xmath17 by the electron plasma period @xmath18 , and the space @xmath19 by the fermi debye radius @xmath20 .",
    "we have introduced the notations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electric permittivity , @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant and the fermi electron temperature @xmath25 , @xmath26 is magnitude of the electron charge , and @xmath27 is the unperturbed electron plasma frequency .",
    "the origin of the various terms in eq.(1 ) is obvious .",
    "the first term is due to the electron inertia , the @xmath28-term is associated from the quantum diffraction effect involving the bohm potential , @xmath29 comes from the nonlinear coupling between the scalar potential ( associated with the space charge electric field resulting form oscillations of the electrons around immobile ions ) and the electron wave function , and the fourth term in the left - hand side of ( 1 ) is the contribution of the 3d electron pressure ( @xmath30 ) for the fermi plasma with a quantum statistical equation of state .",
    "equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) admit a set of conserved quantities @xcite : the number of electrons @xmath31 , the electron momentum @xmath32 , the electron angular momentum @xmath33 , and the total energy @xmath34 dv$ ] , where @xmath35 . in obtaining the total energy @xmath36",
    ", we used the relation @xmath37 , where the electric field @xmath38 .",
    "the conserved quantities are used to maintain the accuracy of the numerical integration of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "we note that linearizing the latter one obtains the epo frequency @xmath39 , which exhibits the dispersive behavior of the epos . in the short wavelength regime characterized by @xmath40 ,",
    "one notices that the dispersion associated with electron tunneling effect dominates over that involving the quantum statistical electron pressure .",
    "we have developed 3d fluid code to investigate nonlinear interactions between multi - scales epos described by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "our 3d fluid code is based on fourier expansion of the bases using a fully de - aliased pseudospectral numerical scheme @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear de - convolution of fourier modes is performed by computing the nonlinear triad interactions @xmath41 at each time , which survive for only those coupled modes which satisfy the fourier triad constraint @xmath42 .",
    "these nonlinear interactions in fourier space follow from a kolmogorov phenomenology of spectral energy transfer , and are mediated predominantly by the neighboring modes . furthermore , such nonlinear interactions in the local spectral space conserve constants of motion of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , as presented above .",
    "the temporal integration is performed by 4th order runge kutta method .",
    "the spectral distribution for turbulent fluctuations is initialized isotropically ( no mean fields are assumed ) with random phases and amplitudes in fourier space .",
    "the evolution variables use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the initial isotropic turbulent spectrum was chosen close to @xmath43 , with random phases in all three directions .",
    "the choice of such ( or even a flatter than @xmath44 ) spectrum treats the turbulent fluctuations on an equal footing and avoids any influence on the dynamical evolution that may be due to the initial spectral non - symmetry .",
    "note , however , that the local as well as global mean flows may subsequently be generated by self - consistently excited nonlinear instabilities . finally , the algorithm employed in our 3d fluid code ensures conservation of total energy and mean fluid density per unit time in the absence of charge exchange and external random forcing , and it is massively parallelized using message passing interface ( mpi ) libraries to facilitate higher resolution .",
    "the conserved quantities , described in section ii , are used to monitor the numerical accuracy of our 3d quantum fluid plasma code .",
    "time step during the numerical integration varies between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the code uses usual 2/3 de - aliasing of the fourier modes , such that the largest @xmath47 is determined typically by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the total number of modes in each direction . the time step used in our 3d simulations not only preserves the conserved quantities , but it also minimizes the aliasing errors .",
    "fluctuations in the electron number density resulting from a steady state turbulence simulations of our 3d electron quantum plasma .",
    "forward cascades are responsible for the generation of relatively small - scale fluctuations in a decaying 3d electron quantum plasma as shown in ( a )",
    ". large scale electron flow structures are present in the electrostatic potential , essentially resulting from a merging of smaller scale fluctuations as shown in ( b ) .",
    "the latter is known as the inverse cascade process .",
    "@xmath50 is used in ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "figures ( c ) and ( d ) depict the electron number density and the electrostatic potential for @xmath51 . ]",
    "the localized initial turbulent spectral distribution , concentrated at the lower wavenumbers , evolves in time following 3d nonlinear electron plasma wave interactions .",
    "since the initial energy is localized in the large scale fluctuations , the latter drive turbulent processes through migration of energy towards relatively small scales consequently , larger eddies transfer their energy to smaller ones through a forward cascade . during the forward cascade process , each fourier mode in the inertial range spectrum obeys the vector triad constraints @xcite imposed by the vector relation @xmath52 .",
    "these nonlinear interactions involve the neighboring fourier components ( @xmath53 ) that are excited in the local inertial range turbulence .",
    "we have performed a number of simulations to verify the consistency of our results in a strong turbulence regime . in our 3d simulations , we have explored two dense plasma systems that are characterized by different physical parameters , _ viz . _ dense warm plasmas in the next generation laser - based plasma compression ( lbpc ) schemes @xcite , and the superdense astrophysical bodies @xcite(e.g .",
    "interior of white dwarf stars ) .",
    "it is expected that in lbpc schemes , the electron number density may reach @xmath54 m@xmath55 and beyond .",
    "hence , we have @xmath56 s@xmath57 , @xmath58 j , @xmath59 j , and @xmath60 . the fermi debye radius @xmath61 @xmath62 . on the other hand , in the interior of white dwarf stars , we typically have @xmath63 m@xmath55 ( such values are also common in dense neutron stars and supernovae ) , yielding @xmath64 s@xmath57 , @xmath65 j , @xmath66 j , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 @xmath62 .",
    "the numerical solutions of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) for @xmath50 and @xmath69 ( corresponding to @xmath70 m@xmath55 and @xmath71 m@xmath55 , respectively ) are displayed in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , which are the electron number density ( the left figure ) and electrostatic ( es ) potential distributions ( the right figure ) in the @xmath72-cube .    one of most notable features of our simulations encompassing 3d electron fluid turbulence is that it exhibits a dual cascade phenomenon , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the electron density distribution in fig 1 shows a tendency to generate smaller length - scale structures , while the es potential cascades towards larger scales .",
    "the co - existence of small and larger scale structures in turbulence is a ubiquitous feature of various 2d and 3d turbulence systems .",
    "for example , in 2d hydrodynamic turbulence , the incompressible fluid admits two invariants , namely the energy and the mean squared vorticity .",
    "the two invariants , under the action of an external forcing , cascade simultaneously in turbulence , thereby leading to a dual cascade phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "3d mhd turbulence exhibits forward cascades of energy and an inverse cascade of magnetic helicity . in these processes ,",
    "the energy cascades towards smaller length - scales , while the magnetic helicity in mhd transfers spectral power towards larger length - scales .",
    "by contrast , the fluid vorticity in 3d hydrodynamics is prohibited from an inverse cascade .",
    "the randomly excited 3d fourier modes nonetheless transfer the spectral energy by conserving the constants of motion in @xmath47-space . in freely decaying quantum electron fluid turbulence",
    "reported here , the energy contained in the large - scale eddies is transferred to the smaller scales , leading to a statistically stationary inertial regime associated with the forward cascades of one of the invariants .",
    "decaying turbulence often leads to the formation of coherent structures as turbulence relaxes , thus making nonlinear interactions rather inefficient when they are saturated .",
    "it is to be noted further that the long scale flow generation in our 3d simulations is observed to be directly proportional to the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "intermittent flows are thus generated for a small value of @xmath28 , while strong and large scale flows in the es potential are formed when the magnitude of @xmath28 is large ( see , e.g. fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "the physical basis of such observation can be elucidated from the following arguments .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 , which is the ratio between the energy density of the epos and the electron kinetic energy density of a warm dense quantum plasma , is associated with a diffraction - like term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) i.e. @xmath73 . in this term",
    ", the negative imaginary part of the complex evolutionary variable @xmath13 essentially determines the rate of dissipation corresponding to the smaller scales .",
    "the smaller is @xmath28 , more the dissipation is concentrated at the smaller scales and vice versa . for a moderately higher magnitude of the @xmath28 parameter , there exists a strong tendency in epo s to dissipate the smaller and intermittent turbulent eddies .",
    "it is therefore this @xmath28 parameter which essentially characterizes electron flows at nanoscales in our 3d simulations .",
    "energy spectrum of 3d epos in a forward cascade regime .",
    "a kolmogorov - like @xmath74 has been observed for @xmath50 .",
    "the spectral index changes with respect to the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "numerical resolution is @xmath75 . ]",
    "while the power spectrum for nonlinear epos exhibits an interesting feature in our 3d simulations , its scaling is not universal and is determined critically by the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , we find a 3d kolmogorov - like power spectrum @xmath74 in some range of @xmath28 values as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding omnidirectional spectrum thus exhibits a @xmath76 scaling .",
    "spectral index nevertheless changes with @xmath28 , as noted also in the study of 2d fluid turbulence @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral slope in the latter was found to be close to the iroshnikov - kraichnan ( ik ) power law @xcite @xmath77 , rather than the usual kolomogrov scaling @xcite @xmath76 .",
    "the origin of the differences in the observed spectral indices resides with the nonlinear character of the underlying warm dense plasmas , as nonlinear interactions in 2d and 3d systems are governed typically by different nonlinear forces .",
    "the latter modify the spectral evolution of turbulent cascades to a significant degree .",
    "time evolution of effective electron diffusion coefficients measured for different values of @xmath28 .",
    "interestingly , smaller values of @xmath28 corresponds to an effective low diffusion coefficient .",
    "the latter characterizes the presence of small scale turbulent eddies which results in suppression of the electron transport . ]",
    "we finally study the electron diffusion coefficient in the presence of small and large scale turbulent epos .",
    "the effective electron diffusion coefficient produced by the momentum transfer can be calculated from @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the electron momentum and the angular bracket denotes spatial averages and the ensemble averages are normalized to unit mass .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath80 , resulting from 3d structures , essentially relates the diffusion processes associated with random translational motions of electrons in nonlinear fields of localized epos .",
    "it is _ remarkable _ to note that the electron transport can be effectively suppressed when the magnitude of the parameter @xmath28 is decreased .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) . the outcome of fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) is contrary to our 2d results @xcite , where the effective electron diffusion was lower when the field perturbations were gaussian and increases later rapidly with the eventual formation of longer length - scale structures . unlike the 2d case , the electron diffusion in 3d case",
    "is suppressed eventually because of the presence of small scale turbulent fluctuations",
    ". however , the steady state diffusion coefficient increases with the increase of @xmath28 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "higher the @xmath28 valuer , the stronger is the small scale damping .",
    "when the small scale fluctuations are smeared out , the dynamical evolution of 3d quantum electron plasma wave turbulence is predominantly governed by the large scale flows , which consequently lead to a higher level of transport .",
    "this finding is further consistent with the fact that the parameter @xmath28 dictates the characteristic evolution properties of the 3d epos , as described above .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented results from 3d nonlinear fluid simulations of the electron fluid turbulence at nanoscales in an unmagnetized warm dense plasma .",
    "the mode couplings between the electron wave function and the electrostatic potential associated with the underlying electron plasma oscillations ( epos ) lead to the onset of nonlinear interactions and subsequent cascades in the inertial range . we find from our 3d simulations",
    "that the dispersion effect associated with the quantum bohm potential plays a critical role in determining the inertial range turbulent spectrum and the subsequent transport level exhibited by the 3d epos .",
    "for instance , a kolmogorov - like @xmath74 3d spectrum is observed for @xmath50 , whereas the spectrum flattens out for a smaller value of @xmath28 .",
    "correspondingly , the electron transport is higher for the higher @xmath28 values . finally , the wave function cascades towards smaller length scales , while the electrostatic potential follows an inverse cascade .",
    "we reiterate that the present investigation of 3d epo turbulence is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the complex dynamical phenomena occurring at nanoscales in warm dense plasmas , such as those in laboratory and astrophysical settings .",
