    "a quarter century ago t hooft and polyakov showed @xcite that magnetic monopoles could arise as topologically stable classical solutions in certain spontaneously broken gauge theories . the fact that these included all grand unified theories led to a considerable theoretical effort to study the detailed properties and the astrophysical and cosmological implications of these gut monopoles , as well as to a number of experimental searches .",
    "however , the failure of these searches to detect any monopoles , together with astrophysical arguments that place stringent bounds on the monopole flux at the earth s surface , has quite understandably led to a decreased interest from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "nevertheless , these monopole solutions remain valuable as tools for probing the properties of quantum field theory . in particular , the properties of monopoles in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit @xcite has led to the conjecture @xcite that the electric - magnetic duality of maxwell s equations might find a quantum field theoretic generalization that exchanges magnetically charged solitons with electrically charged elementary particles .",
    "the prime candidate @xcite for this is @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory . in the case of su(2 ) broken to u(1 ) , the spectrum of massive particles is invariant under the simultaneous interchange of weak and strong coupling and of electric and magnetic charges .",
    "this result generalizes fairly easily to larger gauge groups , as long as the subgroup that remains unbroken is abelian .",
    "however , if the unbroken subgroup is abelian , the elementary particle sector contains massless particles with electric - type charge ( the `` gluons '' and their superpartners ) .",
    "duality would then require the existence of massless magnetically charged particles .",
    "however , one can easily show that these theories have no massless classical soliton solutions . in this talk",
    ", i will argue that , nevertheless , one can find evidence for the required massless monopoles by studying the dynamics of the massive monopoles .",
    "throughout this talk i will work in the bps limit , with monopoles obeying @xmath1 while this limit can be obtained by taking a limit of coupling constants , it is most naturally understood in the context of yang - mills theory with extended supersymmetry , where eq .",
    "( [ bpseq ] ) is equivalent at the classical level to requiring that the soliton preserve half of the supersymmetry .",
    "supersymmetric yang - mills in mind , the only feature of this theory that i will use explicitly is the fact that the higgs field is in the adjoint representation .",
    "note also that there is no confinement in this theory , even if there is an unbroken non - abelian subgroup . ]",
    "this ensures that the bps mass formula @xmath2 is preserved by quantum corrections .",
    "one important feature of the bps limit is that the higgs scalar becomes massless and so can mediate a long - range attractive force between two monopoles .",
    "it turns out that this can exactly balance the magnetic repulsion between static monopoles , thus allowing static multimonopole solutions to exist .",
    "in fact , for the case of su(2 ) broken to u(1 ) , all higher charged bps solutions can be understood as multimonopole solutions of this sort .",
    "not only does a solution with @xmath3 units of magnetic charge have @xmath3 times the mass of the unit monopole , but index theory methods show @xcite that the number collective coordinates needed to quantize the solution is precisely @xmath4 , corresponding to a three - dimensional position and a u(1 ) phase for each of the @xmath3 constituent monopoles ; excitation of these phase coordinates gives independent dyonic electric charges to the individual monopoles .    in order to have the possibility of symmetry breaking to a non - abelian subgroup",
    ", we must start with a gauge group of rank @xmath5 .",
    "the generators of this gauge group can be chosen to be a set of @xmath6 commuting @xmath7 that form a basis for the cartan subalgebra , together with a set of raising and lowering operators associated with the roots @xmath8 . the asymptotic adjoint higgs field in some fixed direction",
    "can always be brought into the form @xmath9 if the @xmath6-component vector @xmath10 has nonzero inner products with all of the roots , then the gauge symmetry is broken maximally , to u(1)@xmath11 ; if not , then the roots orthogonal to @xmath10 yield the root diagram of an unbroken non - abelian group @xmath12 .",
    "the long range part of the magnetic field must lie in the unbroken part of the gauge group .",
    "hence , in the direction used to define @xmath13 , the leading part of asymptotic magnetic field can also be brought into the cartan subalgebra and written in the form @xmath14    in the case of maximal symmetry breaking there are @xmath6 topological charges , one for each of the unbroken u(1 ) factors .",
    "the connection between these and the magnetic charge is most easily seen by choosing a set of @xmath6 simple roots @xmath15 . these form a basis for the root lattice of the lie group with the property that any root can be written as a linear combination of simple roots with coefficients all of the same sign .",
    "there are many possible choices for the simple roots , but the vector @xmath10 associated with the higgs field can be used to pick out a unique set satisfying @xmath16 .",
    "the topological quantization condition @xcite then takes the form @xmath17 where the integers @xmath18 are the topological charges . the bps mass formula , eq .",
    "( [ bpsmass ] ) , can be written as @xmath19 while the number of collective coordinates is @xcite @xmath20    these results suggest that , just as in the su(2 ) case , all higher charged solutions should be viewed as multimonopole configurations .",
    "now , however , there are @xmath6 species of fundamental monopoles , one for each u(1 ) factor , with the @xmath21th species having mass @xmath22 , topological charges @xmath23 , and four degrees of freedom ( three for center - of - mass motion and one u(1 ) phase ) .",
    "these fundamental monopoles can be explicitly obtained by embedding the su(2 ) unit monopole in the su(2 ) subgroups defined by the various @xmath15 .",
    "when the symmetry breaking is nonmaximal , to @xmath24 , some of the simple roots , which i denote by @xmath25 , are orthogonal to @xmath10 and form a complete set of simple roots for @xmath12 .",
    "the remainder , denoted @xmath26 , can required , as before , to obey @xmath27 .",

    "the various allowed sets are related by gauge transformations of the unbroken group .",
    "the @xmath29 are invariant under these transformations , but the @xmath30 are not . ]    in general , the corresponding magnetic field has both abelian and non - abelian components . in order to avoid certain pathologies",
    "@xcite associated with non - abelian magnetic charges , i will assume for the remainder of this talk that @xmath31 for all @xmath32 , so that the long - range magnetic field is purely abelian .",
    "( there is little loss of generality in this assumption since , given a configuration with nonzero @xmath33 , the additional monopoles needed to cancel the non - abelian part of the total magnetic charge can be placed at an arbitrarily large distance . ) with this assumption , eqs .",
    "( [ msbmass ] ) and ( [ msbindex ] ) are replaced by @xmath34 and @xcite @xmath35    analogy with the maximally broken case would then suggest that there is one fundamental monopole , with mass @xmath22 and four degrees of freedom , associated each of the @xmath36 , and one massless monopole , also with four degrees of freedom , associated with each of the @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , the embedding construction for the massive fundamental monopoles goes through pretty much as before .",
    "the massless monopoles , on the other hand , can not be constructed in this manner : applying the embedding construction to the su(2 ) subgroup corresponding to one of the @xmath25 simply yields a pure vacuum solution .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that there are no localized classical solutions with zero energy .",
    "although we can not obtain classical solutions corresponding to isolated massless monopoles , one can find evidence of these monopoles in the dynamics of multimonopole systems .",
    "the moduli space approximation @xcite is a convenient tool for studying such systems at low energy .",
    "the essential idea is to approximate solutions with slowly moving monopoles as being motion on the moduli space of static bps multimonopole solutions .",
    "more precisely , let \\{@xmath37 , @xmath38 } be a family of gauge - inequivalent bps solutions parameterized by a set of collective coordinates @xmath39",
    ". in the moduli space approximation one adopts the ansatz @xmath40 with this ansatz , the time derivatives of the fields are of the form @xmath41   \\equiv \\dot z_j   \\delta_j a_i   \\cr      \\dot \\phi & = & \\dot z_j \\left[{\\partial \\phi \\over \\partial z_j } + [ \\phi ,             \\epsilon_j ] \\right ]   \\equiv \\dot z_j   \\delta_j \\phi    \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the terms involving @xmath42 arise from differentiating the gauge function @xmath43 ; they are fixed uniquely by gauss s law , which turns out to be equivalent to imposing a background gauge condition on @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "substituting this ansatz into the yang - mills lagrangian gives @xmath46      = { 1\\over 2 } g_{ij}(z ) \\dot",

    "\\label{metricdef}\\ ] ] if we interpret @xmath49 as a metric on the moduli space , then the solutions to @xmath50 are simply geodesic motion on the moduli space . in most cases , it turns out not to be practicable to use eq .",
    "( [ metricdef ] ) directly to determine @xmath51 . however , by using indirect methods the moduli space metrics for a number of interesting cases have been by more indirect methods .",
    "i will make use of some of these results in the next two sections .",
    "the simplest example where one finds evidence of massless monopoles arises with the gauge group so(5 ) , whose root diagram is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "with the higgs field vector @xmath10 is in the direction shown on the left , the symmetry is broken to u(1)@xmath52u(1 ) .",
    "there are two species of massive fundamental monopoles , corresponding to the simple roots @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "if instead the higgs vector is vertical , as shown on the right , the unbroken gauge group is su(2)@xmath52u(1 ) , with the su(2 ) having roots @xmath55 .",
    "the fundamental @xmath53-monopole remains massive , but now @xmath54 corresponds to an elusive massless monopole .",

    "( [ so5 g ] ) corresponds to a combination of one massive and one massless monopole .",

    "the singlet terms are just what would be obtained by embedding the unit su(2 ) monopole using the composite root @xmath70 ; they have no dependence on @xmath21 . by themselves",
    ", they would describe an object with a massive core surrounded by a simple coulomb magnetic field .",
    "the doublet terms fall exponentially fast outside the monopole core and are relatively uninteresting .",
    "finally , the triplet parts of the gauge and higgs fields are given by invariant tensors multiplied by the function @xmath71            \\left [ 1 +   { r\\over a } \\coth(vr/2 ) \\right]^{-1 }   \\ , .\\ ] ] for @xmath72 , the second factor on the right hand side is approximately unity , so @xmath73 , and hence the corresponding @xmath74 , falls as @xmath75 .",
    "this produces a coulomb magnetic field in the unbroken su(2 ) subgroup .",
    "however , for @xmath76 , the last factor gives an additional @xmath75 , so the triplet part of @xmath74 falls as @xmath77 , and the non - abelian component of the magnetic field fall more rapidly .",
    "hence , we may view the solution as being composed of a massive core of radius @xmath78 surrounded by a `` cloud '' of non - abelian fields of radius @xmath79 . inside this cloud",
    "one finds the magnetic field appropriate to a monopole with both abelian and non - abelian magnetic charges ; i.e. , the charge appropriate to an isolated massive @xmath53-monopole . outside the cloud ,",
    "only the abelian charge is evident .",
    "thus , the massless @xmath54-monopole can be viewed as a shell of radius @xmath79 surrounding the massive monopole .",
    "curiously , the energy of the solution is independent of @xmath21 , despite the fact that this parameter is not associated with any symmetry of the system .",
    "we can proceed further and examine the moduli space metric . using the explicit form of the solutions and eq .",
    "( [ gdef ] ) , one obtains @xcite @xmath80    \\label{nusmetric}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the same constant as in eq .",
    "( [ msbmetric ] ) .",
    "now let us return for a minute to the maximally broken case and imagine approaching the su(2)@xmath52u(1 ) case by `` rotating '' the higgs vector until it is vertical .",
    "this corresponds to taking the @xmath54-monopole mass , and thus the reduced mass @xmath64 , to zero . taking this limit in the metric of eq .",
    "( [ msbmetric ] ) gives precisely eq .",
    "( [ nusmetric ] ) , except for a curious change in notation : the monopole separation @xmath6 becomes the cloud parameter @xmath21 , while the spatial angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 combine with the relative u(1 ) phase @xmath63 to give the su(2 ) euler angles .",
    "an example with somewhat more structure is obtained by considering the case of @xmath81 broken to @xmath82 , with the unbroken @xmath83 lying in the middle @xmath84 block in a basis where the eigenvalues of the higgs field decrease monotonically along the diagonal .",
    "a purely abelian asymptotic magnetic field can be obtained by setting all of the @xmath85 and @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ nusgdef ] ) equal to unity ; i.e. , by combining one each of the two species of massive and @xmath86 species of massless monopoles .",
    "the moduli space of such solutions is @xmath87-dimensional , with the collective coordinates including a position and u(1 ) phase for each of the massive monopoles , a number of su(@xmath88 ) orientation angles , and a single cloud parameter , @xmath89 , that can take on any value greater than or equal to @xmath6 , the separation between the two massive monopoles .",
    "the solutions can be obtained explicitly @xcite by using the nahm construction @xcite .",
    "although their detailed structure is somewhat complex , their behavior well outside the monopole cores is fairly simple .",
    "the asymptotic higgs field can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a gauge transformation whose form will not concern us and the higgs eigenvalues satisfy @xmath92 .",
    "the unbroken su(@xmath88 ) lies in the middle @xmath84 block corresponding to the repeated eigenvalue @xmath93 .",
    "the form of the magnetic field depends on how the distances @xmath94 and @xmath95 from the two massive monopoles compare to @xmath89 . for @xmath96 , @xmath97 where the dots represent terms that fall off more rapidly with distance , while for @xmath98 @xmath99",
    "thus , at distances smaller than @xmath89 one sees fields corresponding to both abelian and non - abelian magnetic charges , but at larger distances only the abelian component survives , just as in the so(5 ) example .",
    "it is instructive to study the scattering of the two massive monopoles in these solutions . because these monopoles are associated with orthogonal roots [ or , equivalently , because they correspond to embeddings into commuting @xmath100 blocks of the su(@xmath88 ) matrices ] , there is no direct interaction between them .",
    "instead , they must interact through the massless monopole cloud . in the low energy limit",
    ", we can use the moduli space approximation to study this process @xcite .",
    "the moduli space metric for the maximally broken case with @xmath101 distinct massive fundamental monopoles is known @xcite .",
    "the so(5 ) example of the previous section suggests that this metric is still valid when @xmath86 of these monopoles become massless , although , just as in that case , the physical interpretations of the collective coordinates change in the massless limit , with the positions of the massless monopoles being transformed into gauge orientations and a single gauge invariant parameter , @xmath89 .",
    "the various gauge orientation and angular variables are most easily handled by expressing them in terms of the conserved charges and angular momentum .",
    "this still leads to a fairly complicated dynamics , but matters simplify considerably if the electric - type charges in the unbroken @xmath82 all vanish . after separating out the total center - of - mass motion , one",
    "is then left with an effective lagrangian @xmath102 \\dot r^2          + { kb \\over 4(b^2-r^2)}\\dot b^2 + { br \\over b^2 -r^2}\\dot b          \\dot r          - { b j^2 \\over 2r^2(k+\\mu b ) } \\label{sunlag}\\ ] ] governing the time development of @xmath89 and @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath103 is the angular momentum , @xmath64 is the reduced mass of the massive monopoles and , as in the previous section , @xmath65 is a numerical constant .",
    "analysis of the euler - lagrange equations that follow from eq .",
    "( [ sunlag ] ) shows that @xmath6 and @xmath89 decouple at large times .",
    "thus , at large @xmath104 the energy of the system is approximately the sum of a massive monopole kinetic energy @xmath105 and a cloud energy @xmath106 , with @xmath6 and @xmath89 varying asymptotically as @xmath107 with @xmath108 and @xmath109 constants . in a typical scattering process",
    "the cloud initially decreases in size while simultaneously the two massive monopoles approach one another .",
    "eventually @xmath89 and @xmath6 reach their minimum values ( generally not at the same time ) and then begin to to increase again according to eq .",
    "( [ asymbehavior ] ) .",
    "in the course of this process , energy is exchanged between the cloud and the massive monopoles , so that the final splitting between @xmath110 and @xmath111 at @xmath112 is different from the initial one at @xmath113 .    one surprising feature of eq .  ( [ asymbehavior ] )",
    "is the quadratic growth of @xmath89 with time .",
    "it seems likely that this is an artifact of the moduli space approximation , and that radiation of massless gluons will have the effect of reducing this to a linear growth .",
    "electric - magnetic duality in gauge theories with the symmetry spontaneously broken to a non - abelian subgroup requires the existence of massless magnetically charged objects that would be the duals to the electrically charged massless gauge bosons .",
    "these massless monopoles can not be exhibited as isolated classical soliton solutions . however , as i have shown , their existence is manifested through clouds of non - abelian field surrounding one or more massive monopoles .",
    "these clouds are described by a small number of collective coordinates , which correspond to the massless monopole degrees of freedom ; for static solutions , the energy is independent of the values of these parameters .",
    "duality suggests that these cloud parameters should have counterparts in the perturbative sector",
    ". it would be instructive to understand more precisely what these are , and to look in perturbative sector scattering for analogies with the low - energy scattering of massive monopoles and massless monopole clouds .",
    "investigations in this direction would certainly lead to deeper insights into the properties of non - abelian gauge theories .",
