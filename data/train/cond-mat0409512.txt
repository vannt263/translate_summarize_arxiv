    "boron nitride ( bn ) and carbon can be found in similar structures , from the diamond and graphite bulk forms , to nanostructures such as nanotubes ,  @xcite fullerenes @xcite and conical sheets .",
    "@xcite however , unlike carbon , bn structures can contain three types of covalent bonds , namely b - n , n - n , and b - b .",
    "@xcite this leads to a qualitative difference between bn and carbon in the formation of the graphite - derived curved surfaces that are found in nanostructures such as fullerenes and nanotube caps . in carbon , energy minimization leads to structures made of 60@xmath1 disclinations ( conical sheets ) @xcite with isolated pentagons at the apex .",
    "carbon fullerenes are built from such structures . in bn ,",
    "fullerene - like structures are formed from 120@xmath1 disclinations .",
    "@xcite these 120@xmath1 bn disclinations are usually modeled as having a four - membered ring at the apex , @xcite but theoretical calculations indicate that non - stoichiometric bn fullerenes , consisting of pentagon pairs replacing the four - membered rings , may be energetically favored , depending on the stoichiometric condition of growth .",
    "@xcite    a possible reason for the existence of 120@xmath1 disclinations in bn nanostructures , instead of the 60@xmath1 ones that are found in carbon , is the existence of antiphase boundaries ( apb ) in bn disclinations with an odd multiple of 60@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite the common perception is that these apb s , which necessarily contain a line defect of non - bn bonds , should present an energy cost that surpasses the lower elastic - energy cost of a disclination of smaller angle .",
    "however , such a `` no - wrong - bond '' rule @xcite has been challenged by at least two experiments . in their work , bourgeois _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have shown the existence of bn conical nanostructures with a disclination angle of 300@xmath1 , demonstrating the existence of apb s .",
    "another example in the literature is the observation of disclinations in bn nanotube junctions ,  @xcite in experiments whose interpretation is also compatible with the existence of an apb .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the relative stability of nanometer - sized bn cones with and without apb s , for n - rich and b - rich environments .",
    "our first - principles results indicate that , for these two limiting stoichiometric situations , structures with an apb can be more stable than apb - free structures , consisting only of b - n bonds .",
    "we also find structures involving full carbon incorporation at the apb to be among the most stable , under both environments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ method ] we discuss the _ ab initio _ methodology for the computation of the total energies and the definition of chemical potentials for the computation of the zero - kelvin grand potentials ; in sec .  [ apb - el ] we discuss our model for the formation energy as a sum of antiphase boundary and elastic energies ; in sec .",
    "[ abi ] we discuss our first principles results for the relative stability of the various cones and some features of the electronic states of the most stable structures ; and finally , in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we present some discussion of scaling to larger structures than considered in this work and conclusions .",
    "our calculations are based on the density functional theory @xcite as implemented in the siesta program .",
    "@xcite we make use of norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials @xcite in the kleinman - bylander factorized form ,  @xcite and a double-@xmath2 basis set composed of numerical atomic orbitals of finite range . polarization orbitals are included for nitrogen , boron and carbon atoms , and we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "all the geometries are fully relaxed , with residual forces smaller than 0.1 ev /  .",
    "the comparison of bn clusters with different number of atoms is a difficult problem . here",
    ", we propose a zero - temperature thermodynamic approach based on the prior determination of chemical potentials to address this issue .",
    "the robustness of the approach will be established by comparison with results obtained with different chemical potentials , which represent different experimental conditions , and with similar calculations in the literature .",
    "@xcite    in order to address the energetics of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric cones , we must distinguish the different techniques that can be employed in their synthesis . in each case",
    ", we introduce suitable theoretical chemical potentials for nitrogen ( @xmath3 ) and boron ( @xmath4 ) . for the case in which the cones are obtained by laser ablation or arc - discharge from hexagonal bn",
    ", we can have either a nitrogen- or a boron - rich environment , depending on the specific atomic reservoir employed . in the n - rich environment , @xmath3 is obtained from nitrogen in the gas phase , while a metallic @xmath5-b phase is used as the reservoir for the b - rich environment . in both cases , @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "are linked by the thermodynamic constraint @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the chemical potential per bn pair in the infinite , planar bn sheet .",
    "this constraint corresponds to situations in which the nanostructures are formed in equilibrium with bn layers . since we are dealing with finite clusters , we use hydrogen atoms to saturate the dangling bonds at the edges . to take these additional h - b and h - n bonds into account",
    ", we introduce the respective chemical potentials , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and write the formation energy of the cones as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the calculated total energy of the cluster , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the number of b and n atoms , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number of h - b and h - n bonds , respectively . the formation energy , as defined in eq .",
    "[ eform ] , represents the zero - kelvin grand potential which is the proper thermodynamical potential for the comparison of the relative stability of structures with different number of atoms .    a first constraint on the hydrogen chemical potentials is imposed by using a finite planar sheet of boron nitride as reference , and ascribing a null value to its formation energy .",
    "this allows us to write its total energy as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of bn pairs .",
    "the planar reference sheet is centered at a sixfold ring and has @xmath18 symmetry .",
    "therefore , @xmath19 and the preceding equation can be rewritten as @xmath20 where we have defined @xmath21 . using the total energy calculations for the infinite layer and the finite sheet , we find @xmath22 .    from the definition of @xmath23",
    ", we obtain @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) once @xmath9 ( @xmath8 ) is known .",
    "the values of one of these parameters can be determined by choosing a convenient reservoir . in our calculations",
    "we use the ammonia molecule ( nh@xmath24 ) as a reservoir , obtaining @xmath25  ev and @xmath26  ev in the n - rich environment , and @xmath27  ev and @xmath28  ev in the b - rich environment .",
    "the consistency of this methodology was tested by determining @xmath8 using the bh@xmath24 molecule as a reservoir , and then calculating @xmath9 from @xmath23 .",
    "the calculated formation energies in this case are within @xmath29  ev / atom of those from the nh@xmath24 reservoir . for the structures containing carbon ,",
    "the chemical potentials for the carbon atom ( @xmath30 ) and the carbon - hydrogen bonds ( @xmath31 ) are obtained from total energy calculations for bulk graphene and for a finite carbon sheet saturated by hydrogen atoms , respectively .",
    "the physical mechanism that defines whether structures having apb s may be as stable as their apb - free counterparts is the competition between the elastic energy associated with the cone formation and the energetic cost of forming an apb .",
    "hence , we write the cone formation energies , calculated with the above procedure , as the sum of two contributions .",
    "the first is the elastic energy required to fold a finite sheet into a cone , which we describe by a continuum model .",
    "the second represents the apb chemical energetic cost associated with the non - bn bonds .",
    "the basic assumption of the continuum model is that the elastic energy stored in a differential element of area at the surface of the cone is proportional to the square of the surface mean curvature in that region . within this model , the elastic energy of the cone",
    "is written @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the apex angle , @xmath34 is the slant height , @xmath35 is a cutoff length introduced to remove the singularity at the tip ( linear elasticity breaks down in the neighborhood of the tip ) , and @xmath36 is the associated tip energy .",
    "the expression @xmath37 relates the apex angle to the disclination angle @xmath38 .",
    "the validity of the continuum model was first tested for the case of carbon , for which there is no apb .",
    "we found that the first - principles total energy calculations for the graphene sheet , and for the cones with @xmath39 and @xmath40 disclinations are fitted remarkably well by a straight line , when plotted as a function of @xmath41 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 .     formation energy as a function of @xmath41 for carbon cones with @xmath39 and @xmath40 disclinations and for the graphene sheet.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    this fact also shows that there is no tip contribution to the formation energy , i.e. @xmath42 , at least for structures with disclination angles up to 120@xmath1 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that these geometries have the general appearance of truncated cones .",
    "figure  1 also allows us to consider that @xmath35 is the same for the cones with 60@xmath1 and 120@xmath1 disclinations .    adding the apb energies",
    ", we write @xmath43 for the formation energy of bn cones .",
    "the constant of proportionality @xmath44 can be obtained simply by considering that for a @xmath45 disclination there is no apb , hence @xmath46 .",
    "@xcite having @xmath44 and the formation energies , we can use the equation above to estimate the apb energies .",
    "figure 2 shows three of the most stable structures found in our study .",
    "note that each contains a 60@xmath1 disclination , leading to the formation of an apb .",
    "we considered two kinds of apb s : one contains a sequence of parallel ( n - n or b - b ) bonds , as shown in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(c ) , and the other a sequence of zig - zag (",
    "n - n or b - b ) bonds .",
    "these are denoted molecular apb and zig - zag apb , respectively .",
    "@xcite for cones with 120@xmath47 disclinations , we considered structures with a four - membered ring at the apex ( without non - bn bonds ) , as well as structures with two pentagons at the apex , adjacent or not .",
    "disclinations of 180@xmath47 and 300@xmath47 ( each containing an apb ) were also addressed . to make contact with experimental results for the synthesis of bn cones from carbon templates",
    ", we also considered the possibility of carbon incorporation in bn cones , leading to the formation of carbon zig - zag [ shown in fig .",

    "note that the highest apb energies are associated with zig - zag configurations , more specifically a zig - zag boron apb in the n - rich environment , and a zig - zag nitrogen apb in the b - rich environment .",
    "geometric aspects may explain these results .",
    "indeed , zig - zag apb s introduce larger strains in the structures when compared to molecular apb s , since the parallel arrangement of b - b and n - n bonds in the latter is more easily accommodated by the bn matrix of the cone .",
    "table i also shows that for some structures the energetic cost of creating an apb is comparable to the elastic energy , i.e. @xmath50 . for the b - rich environment , these are the molecular apb of boron [ shown in fig .  2(a ) ] and the zig - zag apb of carbon ( with c - b bonds ) , while for the n - rich environment , the ratio is @xmath01 for the molecular apb of nitrogen [ shown in fig .",

    "the underlined numbers in table  i indicate the most stable structures .",
    "a general trend that can be inferred from the numbers in table",
    "i is that the existence of non b - n bonds does not necessarily increase the formation energy .",

    ". underlined numbers indicate the most stable structures for each environment . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     concentrating on the structures with 120@xmath1 disclinations , we note that , under n - rich conditions , the energy of a cone with two non - adjacent pentagons ( containing three n - n bonds ) is comparable to that of a cone with a four - membered ring at the apex .",
    "the same is true if the pentagons are adjacent .",
    "the latter is a stoichiometric structure with only one non - bn bond , and its formation energy is independent of the environment .",
    "concerning the apb s in geometries with 60@xmath1 disclinations , we remark again that under the two limiting stoichiometric conditions we considered , 60@xmath1 disclinations with @xmath50 [ the molecular apb of nitrogen ( in the n - rich case ) and the molecular apb of boron ( in the b - rich case ) ] can be more stable than the apb - free structures with 120@xmath1 disclinations .",
    "these are stable structures , despite being responsible for the existence of gap states .",
    "@xcite ( gap states are absent in the case of cones with a 120@xmath47 disclination . )",
    "the electronic charge densities associated with the gap states for the molecular apb s of boron and nitrogen are shown in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(d ) , respectively .",
    "the nitrogen - apb states show a substantial degree of delocalization , spreading over the bn matrix of the cone , while the boron - apb states remain strongly localized on the b atoms at the apb . in a previous study ,",
    "@xcite we examined the electronic levels of these two structures . in the nitrogen case , we found that three fully occupied levels appear in the lower half of the gap , and fig .",
    "1(d ) shows that they have the same nitrogen lone - pair character that dominates the states at the top of the valence band of the cone .",
    "this leads to a strong mixing between the apb states and the valence - band states in the bulk of the cone , this being the reason for the delocalized character of the nitrogen - apb states . in the case of boron , the states shown in fig",
    "1(b ) are empty levels near the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "they have a more metallic character , differing from the states at the bottom of the conduction band . mixing is absent in this case , leading to the localized distribution seen in fig .",
    "table  i also shows that cones with zig - zag apb s have higher formation energies , and the same occurs for structures with large disclination angles .",
    "the result is expected in the case of the 180@xmath1 and 300@xmath1 disclinations , since besides the cost of forming an apb , the elastic energy is also large .",
    "however , we note that these metastable structures have already been found experimentally .  @xcite    regarding carbon - doped cones , we find that incorporation of carbon at the apb leads to highly stable structures . in this case , for both kinds of apb s the most stable structures are those where the apb is connected to the bn matrix by c - n ( c - b ) bonds in the n - rich ( b - rich ) environment . actually , the most stable of all structures in our study is the c - n connected carbon zig - zag apb , in the n - rich environment , shown in fig .",
    "1(e ) . the electronic charge density of the gap states associated with this structure",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the states are predominantly localized in the antiphase boundary , strongly resembling the states characteristic of the graphite @xmath57 band .",
    "this wavefunction localization leads also to a considerable spin splitting at the fermi level . for the neutral charge state ,",
    "the energy difference between the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( which has majority spin ) and the lowest - unoccupied one ( which has minority spin ) is @xmath58 .",
    "this spin splitting appears only for structures with an odd number of electrons , a result that raises the interesting question about what may happen in the limit of cones with larger sizes .",
    "furthermore , we have also identified a tendency for carbon atoms to segregate at the apb . in our calculations , a single pair of carbons atoms",
    "is found to be more stable ( by @xmath00.07 - 0.15 ev / atom ) on the apb than in the bulk of a bn cone .",
    "this may indicate a tendency for the formation of these carbon - modified apb s , during the synthesis of bn conical nanostructures by substitution on a carbon template .",
    "boron nitride cones can also be obtained by a substitution reaction @xcite on a carbon template in which b@xmath59o@xmath24 and gaseous n@xmath59 are used as sources of boron and nitrogen , respectively . to check the stability trends in this case",
    ", we consider that bn cones and co@xmath59 are the by - products of this reaction .",
    "the nitrogen and boron chemical potentials are then obtained in terms of the total energies of the species involved .",
    "@xcite with this procedure , the value we obtained for the chemical potential difference , @xmath60  ev , is very close to the value of -190.126  ev , obtained for an n - rich environment under the constraint in eq .",
    "[ thermo ] . therefore , the stability trends shown in table  i still hold in this case .",
    "we also checked the robustness of our results with respect to changes in the boundary conditions , which could happen , for instance , if the cones were interacting with different surfaces .",
    "this was done by imposing a constant shift of @xmath61 0.5  ev on all hydrogen chemical potentials .",
    "the ordering of the quantities @xmath51 in table  i remains unaltered , with relative shifts of less than 0.02 ev . still to confirm the validity of our methodology , we mention that similar approaches have been employed in the literature in the determination of formation energies of defects in cubic boron nitride ,  @xcite in boron nitride nanotubes @xcite and in the investigation of possible structures of boron nitride fullerenes .",
    "@xcite in the latter work , the stability trends obtained by using the solid phases of boron and nitrogen together with the constraint in eq .",
    "[ thermo ] remained largely unchanged when the authors considered the gas phase limit of atomic reservoirs .",
    "finally , we discuss the relevance of our results in face of the expected scaling trends . as the size of a cone increases , the apb energy scales linearly with the slant height @xmath34 ( see eq .",
    "[ eel ] ) , i.e. with the square root of the total number of atoms in the structure , while the elastic energy scales sub - linearly with @xmath34 , as shown in eq .",
    "hence , structures without apb s become energetically favored for sufficiently larger sizes .",
    "however , cones of the size we consider in this work may represent the seeds present in the initial steps of the nucleation process that generates larger cones or other nanostructures .",
    "not only the energetics , but also kinetics play an important role in this process , and to the extent that we may expect low energy configurations to be favored for the seeds , cones with certain types of apb s may be good candidates , and kinetics may determine the formation of larger size structures containing apb s .    to summarize , we used first - principles calculations to address the question of how stable are antiphase boundaries in boron nitride nanometer - sized conical nanostructures .",
    "our results indicate that 60@xmath1 disclinations with an apb can be more stable than apb - free 120@xmath1 disclinations .",
    "we show that the formation energies of the stable apb s are comparable to the disclination elastic energy , and that the dependence of the latter on the disclination angle is very well described by a continuum model . also , we observe that carbon incorporation at the apb leads to highly stable structures , of which the most stable presents a large spin splitting ( @xmath58 ) at the fermi level .      100 s. iijima , _ nature ( london ) _ * 354 * , 56 ( 1991 ) . n. g. chopra , r. j. luyken , k. cherrey , v. h. crespi , m. l. cohen , s. g. louie , and a. zettl , _ science _ * 260 * , 966 ( 1995 ) .",
