    "the results presented here are extracted from data collected at  in the @xmath32 , data taking periods .",
    "the fixed - target  experiment ran for more than @xmath33 years until @xmath34 at the electron - positron storage ring of hera  at desy .",
    "the  spectrometer  @xcite was a forward - angle instrument consisting of two symmetric ( top , bottom ) halves above and below the horizontal plane defined by the lepton beam pipe .",
    "it was characterized by very high efficiency ( about @xmath35 ) in electron - hadron separation , provided by a transition radiation detector , a preshower scintillation counter and an electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "in addition , a dual - radiator ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector provided hadron identification for momenta above 2 gev / c .",
    "in order to study the new structure functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : noncol_csec ] ) , a measure of the azimuthal modulation of the unpolarized cross section is needed , which can be extracted via the so - called @xmath36-moments : @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 defined in equation  [ eq : noncol_csec ] .",
    "the extraction of these cosine moments from data is challenging because they couple to a number of _ experimental sources _ of azimuthal modulations , _",
    "e.g. _ detector geometrical acceptance and higher - order qed effects ( _ radiative effects _ ) .",
    "moreover , in the typical case , the event sample is binned only in one variable ( @xmath40-dimensional analysis ) , and integrated over the full range of all the other ones , but the mentioned structure functions and the instrumental spurious contributions depend on all the kinematic variables @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath8 simultaneously .",
    "therefore a @xmath41-dimensional analysis is needed to take into account the correlations between the physical modulations and those spurious contributions , where the event sample is binned simultaneously in all the relevant variables  .",
    "therefore , a detailed monte carlo simulation of the experimental apparatus including radiative effects is used to define a @xmath41-d unfolding procedure  @xcite that corrects the extracted cosine moments for radiative and instrumenthal effects .",
    "the @xmath41-d unfolded yields are fit to the functional form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent the desired moments .",
    "one moment pair ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) for each of the @xmath41-d kinematic bins is extracted , and the moment dependences on a single kinematic variable is obtained projecting the @xmath41-d results onto the variable under study by weighting the moment in each bin with the corresponding @xmath47 cross section obtained from a monte carlo calculation  -d unfolding and extraction procedure as well as on the projection versus the single variable can be found in  @xcite . ] .",

    "the cross section unintegrated over hadron transverse momentum gives access to new exciting aspects of the nucleon structure , which are currently under intense theoretical investigations .",
    "however , as the extraction of unpolarized cosine moments is experimentally challenging , very few measurements have been performed to date , and , with exception of compass  @xcite , most of them average out any possible flavor dependence  @xcite . to date , this analysis at  represents the most complete data set on the subject , and allows access to flavor dependent information on the nucleon internal transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "pions moments projected in the relevant kinematic variables are shown in figure  [ fig : pions ] for @xmath48 ( upper panel ) and @xmath49 ( middle panel ) moments .",
    "the @xmath48 moments are found to be negative for both charged pions , but larger in magnitude for positive ones , while the @xmath49 moments show opposite sign for positive and negative pions : both modulations are clearly charge dependent , and this feature is considered as an evidence of a non - zero boer - mulders effect  @xcite .",
    "results for kaons are shown in figure  [ fig : cosk ] for @xmath48 moments and figure  [ fig : cos2k ] for @xmath49 moments .",
    "the upper panels show results for positive kaons ( stars ) compared to positive pions ( squares ) and unidentified hadrons ( circles ) results , the lower panels the same comparison for negatively charged kaons , pions and hadrons . due to the poorer statistics of kaon event samples ,",
    "the kaon results have been extracted in a reduced kinematic region with respect to the pion moments discussed above resulting in a smaller number of bins shown in the pictures .",
    "the positive kaon @xmath48 moments ( figure  [ fig : cosk ] ) are found to be negative and larger in magnitude than @xmath48 moments extracted for pions , while negative kaons behave similarly to negative pions , showing results compatible with zero .",
    "the absolute value of kaon @xmath1 modulations are found to be larger in magnitude than pions ones . while pion @xmath1 modulations change sign between differently charged pions , kaon s modulations are negative for both kaon charges . in general",
    "the hadrons have a similar trend as the pions but , particularly for the @xmath49 moments , the hadrons are shifted to lower values than the pions .",
    "the discrepancy between hadrons and pions is consistent with the observed kaon moments .",
    "+ the cosine modulations have been extracted also for data collected with deuterium target , and they are found to be compatible with hydrogen results , both for unidentified hadrons , pions and kaons .",
    "this suggests that similar contributions arise from @xmath50 and @xmath51 quarks to the cosine modulations .",
