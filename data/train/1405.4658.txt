    "the ergodic equation   is equivalent to a nonlinear spectral problem which has also received attention in nonlinear perron - frobenius theory , see specially the work of nussbaum  @xcite , and also  @xcite .",

    "it is useful to keep this equivalence in mind as several results relevant to problem   have appeared in the context of the nonlinear eigenproblem  , see for instance  @xcite .",

    "some of these results have been extended to one - player stochastic games with finite state space in  @xcite .",
    "the extension of such results to the two player case appears to be an open question , which is among the motivations leading to the present study .",
    "a useful tool to address the issue of the solvability of the ergodic equation  , or of the corresponding nonlinear eigenproblem  , is the _ recession function _ associated with the shapley operator , @xmath62 which has already been used in several ways  @xcite .",
    "in particular , rosenberg and sorin  @xcite gave conditions for the existence of the mean payoff vector of a two - person zero - sum stochastic game . in their framework , the recession function appears as the shapley operator of the `` projective '' game , which corresponds to the game with no running payments .",
    "if the transition payment @xmath63 is bounded , the recession function @xmath64 does exist , and it is given by @xmath65_i = \\inf_{a \\in a_i } \\sup_{b \\in b_i } p_i^{a b } x ,",

    "we shall refer to such a fixed point as _ trivial_. in  @xcite , gaubert and gunawardena show that the ergodic equation is solvable if @xmath64 has only trivial fixed points . a sufficient explicit condition for this to hold , involving a sequence of aggregated directed graphs , generalizing the classical directed graph of perron - frobenius theory , was given there .",
    "then , in  @xcite , cavazos - cadena and hernndez - hernndez introduced a weak convexity property , and showed that when the conjugate map @xmath52 is weakly convex , the recession function @xmath64 has only trivial fixed points if and only if the first of the directed graphs of  @xcite consists of a single final class and of trivial classes ( reduced to one node , and loop free ) .",
    "they deduced that when @xmath58 is weakly convex , the ergodic equation for all maps @xmath68 with @xmath6 is solvable if and only if @xmath64 has only trivial fixed points .",
    "we shall consider the same additive perturbations @xmath68 of the shapley operator , but without any assumption on @xmath48 except that the payment @xmath63 be bounded . indeed , this weak convexity property is rarely satisfied for games although it captures an interesting class of risk sensitive problems .      our main results , summarized in theorem  [ th - game - ergodicity ] at the end of the paper , show that most of the classical characterizations of ergodicity for finite state markov chains , seen as zero - player games , carry over to the two - player case .",
    "more precisely , given a zero - sum game with finite state space and bounded transition payment @xmath63 , we show in section  [ realizable - section ] that the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "all the fixed points of the recession function @xmath69 of the shapley operator @xmath48 are trivial ( i.e  constant ) ; 2 .",
    "all the games obtained by adding to the transition payment @xmath63 a perturbation depending only of the state have a constant mean payoff vector ; 3 .",
    "the ergodic equation   is solvable for all maps @xmath68 with @xmath70 .    in the zero - player special case",
    ", the above conditions correspond to points   of theorem  [ thm : ergodicitymarkovchain ] .",
    "hence , a zero - sum game will be said to be _ ergodic _ if it satisfies one of these properties .",
    "an ingredient of this equivalence is the result of gaubert and gunawardena in  @xcite described above .    in section  [ galois - section ] , we give a characterization of ergodicity in terms of a galois connection acting on faces of the hypercube @xmath71^n$ ] .",
    "then , in section  [ compact - section ] , we show that under a compactness assumption on the action spaces and a continuity assumption on the transition probability , the latter characterization of ergodicity of a game ( involving a galois connection ) is equivalent to a reachability condition involving a pair of directed hypergraphs .",
    "these two characterizations are a fundamental discrepancy with point   of the zero - player case .",
    "however , the characterization of ergodicity involving the hypergraphs still keeps the same flavor .",
    "indeed , the condition that a directed graph has only one final class can be thought of as an accessibility condition in this directed graph ( see in particular remark  [ remark - hypergraph - graph ] ) . under the compactness and continuity assumption on the action spaces and the transition probability , the galois connection as well as the hypergraphs",
    "are shown to depend only on the _ support _ of the transition probability @xmath12 , which we define to be the set of points at which the function @xmath72 takes nonzero values .",
    "as a result , we get that the ergodicity of a game is a structural property depending only on the support of the transition probability .",
    "we then consider ( in section  [ algorithmic - section ] ) several algorithmic problems concerning games with finite action spaces .",
    "the first one is to check ergodicity .",
    "the restricted version of this problem concerning deterministic games was addressed by yang and zhao  @xcite , in the context of discrete event systems .",
    "they showed that this problem is conp - hard .",
    "however we show , as a corollary of the hypergraph characterization , that checking the ergodicity of a stochastic game is fixed parameter tractable : if the dimension is fixed , we can solve it in polynomial time .",
    "note also that ergodicity can be checked in polynomial time for one - player stochastic games  @xcite .",
    "we finally characterize the situation in which there exists a fixed point having its minimal and maximal entries in prescribed positions . as a by product",
    ", we get a polynomial time algorithm to check the latter property , from which it follows that checking ergodicity is a conp - complete problem . in section  [ ex - section ] , we illustrate our results on some examples .",
    "the present results have been announced in the conference article  @xcite .",
    "in this subsection , we describe formally the zero - sum game with perfect information mentioned above , and state preliminary results .",

    "this game , which we denote by @xmath79 , is played as follows .",
    "starting from a given state @xmath80 at time @xmath81 , known by the players ,  chooses an action @xmath82 .",

    "player  has to pay @xmath84 to player  and the next state , @xmath85 , is chosen according to the probability @xmath86 .",
    "the same procedure is repeated at each time step , giving an infinite sequence @xmath87 .    a strategy @xmath88 ( resp .",

    "<S> a basic question for zero - sum repeated games consists in determining whether the mean payoff per time unit is independent of the initial state . in the special case of `` zero - player '' games , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , of markov chains equipped with additive functionals , the answer is provided by the mean ergodic theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize this result to repeated games . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mean payoff is independent of the initial state for all state - dependent perturbations of the rewards if and only if an ergodicity condition is verified . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is characterized by the uniqueness modulo constants of nonlinear harmonic functions ( fixed points of the recession function associated to the shapley operator ) , or , in the special case of stochastic games with finite action spaces and perfect information , by a reachability condition involving conjugate subsets of states in directed hypergraphs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the ergodicity condition for games only depends on the support of the transition probability , and that it can be checked in polynomial time when the number of states is fixed .    </S>",
