    "forces between particles are governed by fields which themselves can be considered as composed of particles mediating the interaction by continuous exchange processes .",
    "most prominent in the macroscopic world are electromagnetic fields and gravitational fields . for simplicity",
    "we specialize to electromagnetic forces here , but the line of argument scetched out in the following is valid in general .",
    "macroscopic bodies exert electromagnetic forces on one another whenever they are charged , but if they are neutral all electromagnetic forces apparently vanish .",
    "casimir @xcite was the first to realize that this is not quite correct , because the electromagnetic field is fluctuating .",
    "these fluctuations may be due to quantum fluctuations at zero temperature in vacuum or due to thermal fluctuations in a cavity which is in contact with a heat bath . in any case the fluctuation spectrum , i.e. , the energies which are associated with the eigenmodes of the system and the form of the eigenmodes themselves are manifestly influenced by the _ geometry _ of the system .",
    "the geometry is given by an arrangement of surfaces which impose boundary conditions on the fluctuating field and thus determine its mode spectrum .",
    "the free energy , which contains all information about the thermodynamic properties of the system , is essentially given by a sum over all modes and therefore the free energy will become geometry dependent . if , for example , two uncharged metallic bodies are placed at a certain distance in vacuum the free energy of the configuration depends on the shape of the bodies and the distance between them .",
    "therefore , there will be an _ effective force _ acting between the bodies , which is given by the derivative of the free energy with respect to their distance .",
    "note that this force is a direct consequence of the influence of the bodies on the electromagnetic fluctuation spectrum .",
    "apart from the macroscopic length scales set by the geometry there are no other length scales in the system which limit the maximum wavelength of the fluctuations and therefore the force is governed by powers of the imposed length scales and scaling functions of their ratios , i.e. , the resulting force is _ long - ranged_. due to the history of their discovery @xcite these forces are now known as casimir forces and the influence of boundaries on the functional form of the free energy is known as the _",
    "casimir effect_. it should also be noted that the presence of additional bodies in the above setup modifies the force between any two of them , i.e. , it is not possible to express the casimir effect as a sum of two - body contributions only .",
    "there is a vast body of literature on the various aspects of the casimir effect in electromagnetism which are beyond the scope of this article . for a summary",
    "we refer to review articles dedicated to these subjects @xcite and for a recent survey in a more general context we refer to chapter 3 of ref.@xcite . however , for the understanding of the mechanism and the interpretaion of the results it is instructive to demonstrate some of the fundamental physical concepts by a simple example , which we call _ classic _ here for its historic meaning .",
    "let us assume that we have two parallel perfectly conducting plates placed at a distance @xmath0 in vacuum .",
    "we further assume that the plates have an infinite lateral extension so that we consider the thermodynamic limit with respect to the surface area @xmath1 of the plates and only discuss the free energy @xmath2 per unit area , i.e. , we calculate @xmath3 .",
    "note , that @xmath0 is the only macroscopic length scale in the problem .",
    "the mode spectrum of the electromagnetic field in this parallel plate geometry is particularly simple . in three dimensions the wave vector @xmath4 consists of a lateral component @xmath5 which is unconstrained by the geometry and a discrete perpendicular component @xmath6 for @xmath7 due to the condition that the electric field vector at each of the metallic surfaces must be aligned with the surface normal .",
    "a single mode is then characterized by @xmath8 and @xmath9 and its energy level spacing is given by @xmath10 the energy content @xmath11 of a particular mode is given by its occupation number @xmath12 in the form @xmath13 .",
    "the free energy per unit area is then given by ( see also ref.@xcite for a recent reconsideration of the casimir effect at general temperature ) @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the boltzmann constant and the temperature , respectively .",
    "an additional factor of two coming from the summation over the polarizations has already been included in eq.([f ] ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath8 is carried out to an ultraviolett cutoff @xmath17 and the sum is truncated at some maximum mode number @xmath18 . the ultraviolett cutoff parameter @xmath17 is typically determined by the radius of the first brillouin zone of the plate material . if @xmath19 is the lattice constant of the material we identify @xmath20 .",
    "the maximum mode number @xmath18 can be written as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is also a microscopic length scale ( see below ) .",
    "for @xmath23 only the first term in eq.([f ] ) remains and this is the first example studied by casimir @xcite .",
    "here , we will discuss the high temperature limit @xmath24 , because this allows us to illustrate some aspects of the calculations involved within continuum models like , e.g. , the ginzburg - landau model on a rather elementary level .",
    "for the more general case of layered dielectrica at finite temperature ( dispersion forces ) we refer to the classical literature @xcite and to ref.@xcite . to",
    "leading order in @xmath25 we obtain @xmath26 note that the integral and the summation in eq.([fhight ] ) are only meaningful for finite cutoff parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 . however , we only need the final result in the limits @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for simplicity",
    "we identify @xmath29 to the order of magnitude which implies @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 .",

    "we obtain @xmath34 where terms which _ vanish _ in the limit @xmath33 have already been dropped . in order to evaluate eq.([fht ] ) further for large @xmath18 and @xmath35 we employ stirlings formula and the series expansion of the logarithm . with @xmath36 and @xmath21",
    "we obtain the final result @xmath37 + { \\pi k_b t \\over 8 a^2}\\left[2 \\ln \\left({a \\over b}\\right ) + 1 \\right ] - { k_b t \\over l^2}\\ { \\zeta(3 ) \\over 8 \\pi } + \\dots\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a special value of the riemann zeta function and the dots indicate contributions which are exponentially small in @xmath39 . all terms which vanish in the limit @xmath33 ( @xmath40 ) have consistently been dropped .",
    "the decomposition of the free energy per unit area given by eq.([fhtfin ] ) is a special case of the general decomposition @xmath41 for a film with two surfaces of type @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath0 and it corresponds to the _ bulk _ contribution of the free energy . in our example",
    "it is given by the radiation pressure @xmath43 between the plates .",
    "the second contribution to eq.([fhtfin ] ) is independent of @xmath0 and it therefore corresponds to the sum of the surface free energies or _ surface tensions _",
    "@xmath44 , where @xmath45 in the above example .",
    "the third contribution varies as @xmath46 and it corresponds to the fluctuation induced long - ranged _",
    "casimir interaction _ between the plates , which is the most prominent contribution to the _ finite - size _ part @xmath47 of the free energy in our example .",
    "note that the casimir contribution is _ independent _ of the microscopic cutoff parameters @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "its absolute strength at a given distance @xmath0 and temperature @xmath16 is governed by the numerical constant @xmath48 which is usually called the _",
    "casimir amplitude_. the casimir amplitude is negative here , so that the casimir force between the plates is _",
    "attractive_. the casimir interaction can be obtained in very elegant ways known as zeta - function regularization , algebraic cutoff , or exponential cutoff schemes @xcite .",
    "their equivalence with respect to the cutoff - independent casimir interaction has been explicitly shown for the example presented here @xcite .",
    "for further details see also ref.@xcite .",
    "the above example for the casimir effect appears to be very specific at first sight , but the functional form of the free energy given by eqs.([fhight ] ) and ( [ fhtfin ] ) is far more general than it seems .",
    "in fact , the underlying mechanism which leads to fluctuation induced long - ranged forces only requires a fluctuating field with geometric restrictions and a macroscopic length scale @xmath0 imposed by the geometry as the only limiting factor for the wavelength of the fluctuations . any system which is at a",
    "_ critical point _ also meets this requirement .",
    "the fluctuating field in this case is given by the order parameter and each of the individual contributions to the free energy as given by eq.([fdecomp ] ) is a sum of a _",
    "part and _ singular _ part which contains the critical behavior of the system .",
    "right _ at _ the critical point the correlation length @xmath49 is infinite so that the distance @xmath0 between the system boundaries provides the only macroscopic length scale as required for the occurrence of long - ranged fluctuation induced forces .",
    "above the critical point the correlation length is finite and therefore the ratio @xmath50 governs the range of these forces .",
    "the existence of casimir forces in critical systems was anticipated by fisher and de gennes @xcite in the framework of the so - called distant wall corrections to critical profiles , where in many cases the casimir amplitudes govern the leading distant - wall correction term to the profile in the vicinity of one of the system boundaries . for details and an extendend list of further references",
    "the reader is referred to chapter 4 of ref.@xcite and to ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that the casimir amplitudes @xmath51 and the associated scaling functions @xmath52 that take the place of these amplitudes for _ finite _ @xmath53 ( see ref.@xcite and sec.2 ) are _ universal _ , i.e.",
    ", they do not depend on microscopic details of the system under consideration .",
    "note , however , that the precise form of the scaling functions @xmath54 depends on the _ definition _ of the correlation length @xmath49 . for systems with surfaces",
    "the concept of universality classes raises the question of whether there is _ surface _ critical behavior and to what extent it is governed by _",
    "universal surface critical exponents_. during the 1980 s this question was answered in favor of the general ideas of critical behavior and universality , i.e. , microscopic surface properties are indeed unimportant .",
    "one only has to specify the type of _ boundary condition _ which the surface imposes on the order parameter . in this respect",
    "there are only three fundamentally different _",
    "surface universality classes _ @xcite . in particular",
    ", the surface may enhance the order parameter with the result that the system undergoes a second order phase transition in presence of an already _ ordered _ surface ( extraordinary transition , e ) .",
    "the surface may also suppress the order parameter with the result that the system undergoes a second order phase transition in presence of a _ disordered _ surface ( ordinary transition , o ) .",
    "finally the surface and the bulk may order at the _ same _ temperature ( special transition , sb ) , so the critical point of the system is in fact a _",
    "multicritical _ point .",
    "if the spatial dimensionality @xmath55 of the system is high enough there are two options for the occurrence of surface order above the bulk critical temperature @xmath56",
    ". the surface may order _ spontaneously _ at a certain critical temperature @xmath57 _ or _ the surface may be ordered _ externally _ by the presence of a _",
    "surface field_. the bulk transition in presence of an externally ordered surface is called _ normal _ transition .",
    "however , it has been shown recently by rigorous arguments that the normal and the extraordinary transitions only differ by corrections to scaling , so both belong to the extraordinary surface universality class @xcite .",
    "surface critical behavior has already been extensively reviewed @xcite ( see also chapter 2 of ref.@xcite for a short summary ) , so we refrain from giving further details here .",
    "the distinction between the surface universality classes is vital for the casimir forces , because the casimir amplitudes @xmath51 and the scaling functions @xmath54 depend on them .",
    "the simplest boundary conditions apart from periodic ones are _ dirichlet _ boundary conditions which suppress the order parameter to zero at the surface .",
    "a system with these boundary conditions provides a representation of the ordinary surface universality class .",
    "the first systematic field - theoretic calculation of a casimir amplitude was done by symanzik @xcite for this case .",
    "starting from eq.([fhight ] ) the above example essentially reproduces all neccessary steps for such a calculation at the one - loop level ( gaussian theory ) . in general , concepts of the field - theoretic renormalization group",
    "are required which can not be described here .",
    "the application of field theory to the critical behavior of finite systems is a field of ongoing research @xcite which has recently furnished unexpected results concerning the occurrence of _ nonuniversal _ critical finite - size behavior above the upper critical dimension @xcite . for reviews about the general concept of critical finite - size scaling the reader",
    "is referred to ref.@xcite .    above the critical temperature the range of the casimir force",
    "is always limited by the correlation length , but below the critical temperature the situation may be different . in ising - like systems",
    "the correlation length is also finite below @xmath56 and therefore the casimir forces have a finite range .",
    "if the system has a continuous symmetry , however , _",
    "goldstone modes _ cause correlation functions of the order parameter to remain long - ranged below @xmath56 .",
    "the most prominent examples are xy and heisenberg ferromagnets which posess an @xmath58 symmetry with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , in contrast to the ising ferromagnet @xmath61 . in other words ,",
    "the correlation length of continuous ferromagnets remains infinite below @xmath56 and therefore goldstone modes also give rise to fluctuation induced long - ranged forces between system boundaries .",
    "fluids with this property are sometimes called _",
    "correlated fluids_. the most important examples with respect to experimental realizations are liquid @xmath62he below the superfluid - normal transition @xcite and nematic liquid crystals in the nematically ordered phase @xcite , where fluctuations of the nematic director are responsible for the long - ranged nature of the casimir force . near the phase transition to the isotropic phase fluctuations of the degree of",
    "nematic order and the degree of biaxiality generate _ short - ranged _ corrections to the casimir force @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "we have mentioned three options for the occurrence of fluctuation - induced long - ranged forces : the presence of long - ranged interactions ( e.g. , electromagnetism , see sec.1.a ) , the presence of critical fluctuations , and the presence of goldstone modes . in the following overview",
    "we will only consider the second option , i.e. , systems in the vicinity of critical points .",
    "in particular , recent progress in the theoretical understanding of critical casimir forces for all surface universality classes and especially for curved geometries will be presented .",
    "special attention is also paid to the comparison of casimir amplitudes and corresponding scaling functions with computer simulations and experiments , which are still in progress at this time . due to the limited scope of this article other interesting developments in related areas",
    "will not be described in any detail and an apology is made in advance to all authors whose work is not explicitly mentioned here .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized according to the three main approaches to critical casimir forces , namely analytic theory , computer simulation , and experiments .",
    "the analytic theory of the casimir effect in critical systems is based on the concept of finite - size scaling @xcite .",
    "exact solutions of model systems in statistical mechanics give only limited access to the finite - size scaling functions , because they are mainly restricted to two dimensional systems . in @xmath63 dimensions",
    "only the spherical model can be analyzed in a rigorous fashion @xcite which has recently been done with special regard to the film geometry for @xmath64 dimensions @xcite . despite their limitations",
    "exact solutions provide valuable insight into the structure of the scaling functions and sometimes the results for @xmath65 can be used to improve estimates obtained by approximative methods for @xmath64 ( see sec.3 of ref.@xcite and below ) .",
    "the concept of finite - size scaling is a natural extension of the principle of _ scale invariance _ to critical systems with geometric constraints on macroscopic length scales .",
    "the principle of scale invariance itself may be viewed as a special case of the more general principle of _ conformal invariance _ ( see sec.3 of ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "conformal invariance implies the equivalence of systems with boundaries at @xmath66 if these systems can be mapped onto one another by a conformal transformation .",
    "the principle of conformal invariance holds in any dimension , but it is particularly powerful for @xmath65 due to the exceptional large number of conformal mappings in this case ( large conformal group , see ref.@xcite ) . note that scale transformations are just very special conformal mappings . in the framework of conformal field theory",
    "the _ stress tensor _ plays a key role @xcite .",
    "here we only mention that the thermal average of the stress tensor yields the local casimir force in a critical system and therefore the stress tensor provides a very important tool in the analytic theory of the casimir effect .",
    "in fact , most of the casimir amplitudes for @xmath65 have been obtained from conformal field theory rather than exact solutions ( see sec.3 of ref.@xcite and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "many of the experimentally relevant results have been obtained from a field - theoretic analysis of the well - known ginzburg - landau hamiltonian @xmath67 with geometric constraints which can be decomposed according to @xmath68 .",

    "the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspond to the bare reduced temperature and external field . the physical ( renormalized ) reduced temperature and external field will be denoted by @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the following .",
    "the surface contribution @xmath78 can be written as @xmath79,\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 correspond to the surface enhancement and the surface field , respectively @xcite .",
    "note , that the surface @xmath82 may consist of serveral disjoint parts .",
    "the last contribution @xmath83 contains edge and curvature contributions to the hamiltonian @xmath67 which have first been considered in ref.@xcite within the framework of the renormalization group . for experiments the ordinary transition @xmath84 and the extraordinary transition ( e.g. , @xmath85 ,",
    "see also ref.@xcite ) are the most important cases .",
    "neither @xmath78 nor @xmath83 needs to be considered here in any detail , because their effect is completely contained in the boundary conditions for the order parameter @xmath86 .",
    "we will therefore restrict the following discussion to the ordinary and the extraordinary surface universality class and to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the spherical model can be considered as the @xmath33 limit of @xmath58 symmetric classical spin models and it can also be expressed as the @xmath87 limit of eqs.([hb ] ) and ( [ hs ] ) .",
    "we only summarize the most recent results here , for a brief overview the reader is referred to sec.2.2 of ref.@xcite and to ref.@xcite . in the presence of an external field @xmath77 and for sufficiently small values of the reduced temperature @xmath88 the _ singular _ contribution @xmath89 to the finite - size part @xmath47 of the free energy per unit area in a film geometry ( see eq.([fdecomp ] ) ) in @xmath55 dimensions can be cast into the scaling form @xcite @xmath90 near the critical point given by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 indicates the combination of surface universality classes at the two surfaces . the critical exponents @xmath94 and @xmath95 characterize the temperature dependence of the correlation length @xmath96 , @xmath97 and the order parameter ( spontaneous magnetization ) @xmath98 , @xmath99 for @xmath100 , respectively .",

    "the problem of substrate roughness in wetting experiments has already been mentioned above and for the case of quenched roughness theoretical results already exist @xcite . however , one of the boundaries of a wetting layer is a free liquid - vapor interface , which may undergo large scale fluctuations due to capillary waves .",
    "what kind of corrections capillary waves as additional degrees of freedom impose on the critical casimir potential is an open question .",
    "quantitative estimates of these corrections are not only important for experiments , they would also aid the data interpretation of computer simulations for critical wetting layers . to",
    "what extent off - coexistence effects influence experimental and numerical wetting layer data is also a largely open problem . in this respect",
    "the recently explored numerical access to the stress tensor of lattice models may prove particularly useful @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that improvements of existing theoretical or numerical estimates for the scaling function @xmath114 of the casimir force in particular for the extraordinary surface universality class in various geometries are still needed in order to extract the casimir effect from experimental data as reliably as possible .",
    "although the history of the casimir effect goes back more than half a century it has remained an active field of research .",
    "this article can therefore only provide a snapshot of current knowledge in this area rather than a completed picture .",
    "if this presentation could finally help to trigger or direct new research work in this field , then its main purpose would be fulfilled .",
    "the author gratefully acknowledges stimulating discussions with m. h. w. chan , s. dietrich , r. garcia , m. kardar , b. m. law , a. mukhopadhyay , and f. schlesener .",
    "financial support for this work has been provided through the heisenberg program of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft , which is also gratefully acknowledged .",
