    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : runs ]    the coronal heating problem has been one of the primary challenges in the field of solar physics since @xcite first discovered the extremely hot corona above the cool photosphere .",
    "it is widely accepted that the ultimate energy source of the coronal heating is the solar convective motion @xcite .",
    "however , the transportation and dissipation mechanisms acting in the corona have not yet been identified . as the coronal heating mechanisms are closely linked to the process of mass loss from stellar objects , investigation of the solar corona is quite important as regards the further advancement of astrophysics .",
    "the primary objective of this paper is to distinguish between the competing coronal - heating - mechanism theories in the framework of wave heating models . in plasma with a high magnetic reynolds number , like the solar corona",
    ", heating events occur on an extremely small scale in the form of shocks @xcite , resonant absorption @xcite , phase mixing , or turbulence @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the solar atmosphere allows this wide variety of heating mechanisms to act , which increases the complexity of the coronal heating problem .    of the various wave heating mechanisms ,",
    "the present study focuses on the competition between shock heating and turbulent heating . super - radially expanding flux tubes extending from the photosphere allow alfvn waves to increase the wave nonlinearity as they propagate outwardly .",
    "the nonlinear alfvn waves are known to create slow and/or fast shocks through nonlinear mode conversion @xcite .",
    "if the amplitude of the alfvn waves excited at the photosphere exceeds 1 km s@xmath0 , these waves are considered to drive the spicules @xcite , to heat the corona @xcite , and to accelerate the solar wind @xcite .",
    "turbulent heating is also a plausible heating mechanism , and nonlinear interactions between the alfvn waves may drive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the corona and the solar wind @xcite . note that mhd turbulence",
    "is often described using the so - called reduced mhd ( rmhd ) formulation @xcite , and some recent studies have applied the rmhd framework to the coronal loops .",
    "recent numerical simulations suggest that shock heating is dominant below the transition region , while turbulent heating is dominant above the transition region @xcite . however , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) mhd and rmhd formulations can not determine the most applicable heating mechanisms among the various competing theories , such as those involving shocks and turbulence .",
    "previously , @xcite have investigated the competition between the shock and turbulent heating using a time - steady mhd model of the solar wind .",
    "their model includes phenomenological heating mechanisms involving shock and turbulence , which should be confirmed by dynamical simulations .",
    "@xcite have also suggested heating mechanism transitions from compressible to incompressible heating , using 2.5-dimensional ( 2.5d ) mhd simulations .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of those simulations is too low to allow turbulent structures to be resolved , generating the suspicion that a higher - resolution simulation could change the results significantly .",
    "this situation motivates us to perform mhd simulations with high resolution in order to investigate the heating mechanisms in the coronal loops .",
    "as coronal loops have a shorter alfvn transit time and smaller spatial scale than those in the open flux region , the numerical - computation cost can be reduced significantly .    in this paper , a high - resolution mhd simulation of the coronal loops",
    "are performed under the hypothesis that the heating rate can be maintained with higher resolution through development of the mhd turbulence .",
    "accordingly , the spatial resolution is changed from 25 to 3 km and , as a result , the higher resolution leads to the formation of thinner current sheets that maintain the heating rate .",
    "note that the conditions that maintain the turbulence or their three - dimensional ( 3d ) extensions have not yet been determined ; this is a topic of investigation for future papers .",
    "in this study , 2.5d mhd simulations were performed in order to mimic a single coronal loop .",
    "the loop was assumed to be 100 mm in length ( @xmath1 ) and 3 mm in width ( @xmath2 ) . for simplicity , the curvature of the loop was ignored ; thus , a straight idealized loop in a rectangular region ( @xmath3 $ ] mm , @xmath4 $ ] mm ) was considered .",

    "the mean molecular weight was assumed to be dependent on the temperature only , in order to mimic hydrogen ionization .",
    "more detailed descriptions of the thermal conduction , radiative cooling , and equation of state can be found in @xcite .",
    "for the gravitational acceleration force , a half circle loop was assumed @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the unit vector in the @xmath5 direction .    as the initial conditions , a static and isothermal atmosphere with a temperature of 10@xmath27 k along the entire loop was established .",

    "the density distribution above 10 mm was assumed to be proportional to @xmath30 , which was not in the initial dynamical equilibrium state .",
    "these initial conditions were chosen because of the numerical tractability in the initial phase , which is not a focus of interest in the present study .",
    "note that the results presented in this paper correspond to a significantly later phase and do not depend on the initial conditions .",

    "the maximum field strength at the boundary is 1278 @xmath37 , which corresponds to a expansion factor ( @xmath38 ) of approximately 128 .",

    "note that the total power used in this simulation is almost equivalent to the maximum amplitude of the observed photospheric velocity fluctuation , which has been estimated to be a few kilometres per second based on the bright - point motion or using local correlation tracking @xcite .",
    "four sets of numerical simulations were performed with the same initial and boundary conditions by changing the numerical resolution . in our previous study ,",
    "a very low resolution ( grid number in the @xmath6 direction , @xmath42 = 32 or @xmath43 km ) was employed to extend the numerical domain to the solar - wind acceleration region @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the target was switched from the solar wind to the coronal loop , which has a smaller system size and a shorter relaxation time scale .",
    "a uniform grid width was implemented in the @xmath6 direction , while a nonuniform grid was implemented in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the numerical scheme adopted in our simulation was the hlld scheme @xcite .",
    "the second - order accuracy in both space and time were determined using the muscl interpolation with the minmod limiter and runge - kutta integration .",

    "the loop top temperature , density , and loop length for run 4 were 1.03 mk , 1.63 @xmath46 10@xmath47 @xmath29 , and 84 mm on average , respectively .",

    "[ fig : spprof]b , the numerical temperature profile is similar to the theoretical profile above 20 mm ; however , a more gradual change is apparent in the former than the latter below 20 mm .",

    "the @xmath59 of @xmath44100 km s@xmath0 at the loop top obtained in the present study is almost five times larger than the observational results .",
    "the propagation of alfvn waves excited at the photosphere indicates a wide variety of transient properties in the atmosphere above .",
    "in particular , the dynamics of the model atmosphere has four remarkable features associated with alfvn waves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot_summary ] ; video available online : movies 1 and 2 ) .",
    "first , the transition region exhibits fluctuations , which originate from the collisions between the shocks and the transition region ; these collisions elevate the chromospheric materials to the coronal height @xcite .",
    "this ascending motion is then followed by a descending motion due to the gravitational force , which can be interpreted as a spicule .",
    "second , the transition region is corrugated by alfvn waves such that it contains many peaks and valleys .",
    "these structures are produced by the chromospheric turbulence driven by the nonlinear interaction of the alfvn waves .",
    "the alfvn wave fronts are also corrugated before their collision with the transition region . this corrugation feature is a distinct property of the 2d simulation and can not be produced in 1d simulations .",
    "note that the corrugation process in the chromosphere is not driven by the corrugation instability @xcite , as this process applies even in the case of fast shocks , which are stable against corrugation instability .",
    "instead , nonlinear interactions between the magnetoacoustic waves and alfvn waves create fluctuations on a smaller spatial scale .",
    "note that the corrugation pattern can be the same phenomena as horizontally propagating surface waves excited by photospheric perturbation found by @xcite .",
    "third , the resultant loop consists of numerous thin threads having an almost isothermal nature and no clear typical width .",
    "the differential emission measure constructed at the loop top has a value of 3.3 @xmath46 10@xmath61 @xmath62 k@xmath0 at its peak , with a narrow distribution ( 0.13 in @xmath63 k ) .",
    "the power spectra of the density , temperature , and synthesized intensity of aia 171@xmath64 in the @xmath6 direction show a power law distribution with a cut - off in the vicinity of the dissipation scale ( @xmath44100 km for run 4 ) .",
    "there is no elemental scale other than the dissipation scale and the smaller - scale length appears in the simulation with the higher - resolution run .    finally , the peaks and valleys in the transition region exhibit gentle oscillations .",
    "these oscillations correspond to the manifestation of compressible fast waves in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane , which are driven by nonlinear mode conversion of the alfvn waves .",
    "the oscillation seems to be uniform in the @xmath6 direction , which may be a signature of the body waves rather than the surface waves .",

    "the solid and dotted lines indicate positive and negative values , respectively . ]",
    "the thermal structure of the model atmosphere is determined by examining the energy balance between heating and cooling .",
    "as no explicit dissipation terms were included in the basic equations , the heating was purely derived from the nature of our numerical scheme . in a previous study",
    ", @xcite developed a means of estimating the numerical heating rates ( @xmath65 ) , which was employed here .",
    "@xmath65 is the same quantity as @xmath66 in @xcite which can be estimated using discretization errors in the equation of total energy .",
    "@xmath65 is a good indicator of numerical heating rate per volume especially for the dissipation of alfvn waves , which is demonstrated by problems of linear mhd wave dissipation .",
    "the spatial distribution of the heating rate , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ebalance ] , decreases exponentially with height below 20 mm .",
    "the average scale height of the heating rate is approximately 2 mm in the chromosphere , where the radiative cooling is balanced by the conduction gain and numerical heating .",
    "further , the heating rate in the corona ( 20 mm @xmath67 80 mm ) is almost spatially uniform . as for the cooling rate ,",
    "the radiative loss is dominant below 20 mm , while the thermal conductive loss is dominant in the corona .",

    "the solid lines within white envelopes represent the magnetic field lines .",
    "two corrugated shocks are indicated by white arrows . ]",
    "the alfvn waves excited randomly at the photosphere form a number of shocklets in the chromosphere .",
    "the shock fronts tend to form a wedge - like structure @xcite determined by the difference in the alfvn speed across the super - radially expanded flux tube .",
    "as the shocks travel upward , the shock fronts corrugate or fragment into smaller shocks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crd2 ] ) .",
    "the corrugation process plays an important role in driving the mhd turbulence in the chromosphere .     and",

    "the resultant heating rate can be divided into compressible and incompressible heating rate .",
    "we assume that the compressible heating mainly stems from shocks while the incompressible heating originates from the direct dissipation of magnetic and velocity shear due to alfvn waves .",
    "the heating rate induced by the compressible process can be roughly estimated as follows .",
    "let @xmath69 be a given set of time that has a duration @xmath70 for which the heating rate will be analyzed .",

    ". then duration of @xmath69 is defined by integrating all the members of @xmath69 , @xmath72 @xmath69 can be devided into two subsets .",
    "the first subset of time , @xmath73 , is defined as convergent period whose members satisfy @xmath74 and can be described as @xmath75 .",
    "the other subset of time , @xmath76 , is defined as divergent period that can be described as @xmath77 .",
    "note that @xmath73 and @xmath76 are the functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the duration of each subsets are also defined as , @xmath78 the thermal energy supplied by numerical heating rate ( @xmath65 ) during @xmath79 and @xmath80 can be expressed as @xmath81 we assume that the contribution of shear to heating is always active , while the contribution of shocks is concentrated within periods of time and space where @xmath82 , denoted by @xmath73 .",
    "we have then the two periods : @xmath83 in order to decompose the contribution of shear and shocks , it is also assumed that @xmath84 is not varying statistically .",
    "then the temporal average of @xmath84 is identical during the two periods : @xmath85 where @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 is any functions of time .",
    "only @xmath65 is measured directly , but since @xmath89 , we can write @xmath90 in terms of @xmath65 as : @xmath91 using the respective time duration of the two periods , we can finally find @xmath92 which gives the relation between integrated energies .",
    "although this is a crude approximation , it helps us to distinguish between the compressible and incompressible heating processes . fig .",

    "the ratio is averaged over 150 km in both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions in order to increase the statistics .",
    "the compressible heating rate is almost 50 % for the 14-mm region , which means that shock heating is effective in this region .     at ( a ) 6 mm and ( b ) loop top for different spatial resolutions .",
    "the solid straight line in each panel shows the power law ( @xmath95 ) for reference . ]",
    "the contribution of the incompressible heating to the total heating rate is 50 % between 1 and 4 mm and more than 90 % above 4 mm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmp_heat_ratio ] ) .",
    "the 4-mm height corresponds to the top of the magnetic canopy , where the flux tube merges with the neighbouring flux tubes . as the magnetic field strength becomes constant above 4 mm , the alfvn speed increases with height because of the density stratification .",
    "cascading of the alfvn waves across the @xmath6 direction can be seen in this region .",
    "the cascading process creates a large number of thin current sheets extended toward the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the wave heating is highly dynamic and occurs on these thin current sheets .",
    "power spectra usually provide useful information on the properties of turbulent phenomena . here",

    "the effective @xmath137 is estimated to be @xmath140 , if the typical length ( @xmath135 mm ) and the typical alfvn speed ( @xmath141 km s@xmath0 ) are used .",
    "in this study , a 2.5d mhd simulation for a coronal loop were performed .",
    "it was found that the dissipation of alfvn waves can maintain the hot coronal loop , which satisfies the rtv scaling law , provided the maximum energy input from the photosphere is available .",
    "the resultant transition region has a multithread structure and exhibits a fluctuating motion similar to the spicule motion .",
    "the model loop consists of numerous thin threads with an isothermal nature and no elemental width .",
    "although a small spatial grid ( from 25 to 3 km ) was used in this study , the loop top temperature and density continued to increase with improved spatial resolution .",
    "both the shock heating and turbulent heating were found to be in effect in the region of 1 - 4-mm height , while the mhd turbulence was found to primarily heat the atmosphere above 4 mm . according to the transfer analysis of our mhd simulations , both compressible and field stretching motion",
    "contribute to the turbulent cascade in the upper chromosphere , while only the field stretching motion is important in the corona .",
    "as the resultant coronal loop obeys rtv theory well , our model has at least two inconsistencies with the recent observations .",
    "first , the obtained temperature distribution is inconsistent with the observed distribution , which has a flatter profile along the loop @xcite .",
    "second , our model can not explain the over- or under - dense loops that are very common in the sun .",
    "impulsive heating events such as nanoflares are required in order to explain this behaviour @xcite .",
    "even though our model corona reveals a 10 % fluctuation from the average in the heating rate , the system exhibits a quasi - steady state rather than dynamical evolution .",
    "further , the average height of the transition region in our simulation ( 7.7 mm ) is larger than the observed height of 2 mm @xcite .",
    "the important factors necessary to determine the height of the transition region are the heating rate in the corona and the @xmath55 or @xmath56 from the waves .",
    "a larger heating rate in the corona generally produces higher coronal pressure , resulting in a smaller transition - region height from the perspective of the pressure balance between the corona and the chromosphere .",
    "further , larger wave pressure elevates more material into the chromosphere , thereby generating higher chromospheric pressure , which creates a taller transition region . in our simulation ,",
    "both effects create a taller transition region",
    ".    the mhd turbulence in the chromosphere may be the key process in the creation of thread - like structures such as spicules along the magnetic field lines .",
    "it was found that the thread - like structures can be produced even if the initial wave perturbations are uniform in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "this indicates that spicular structures can be created naturally , even when the magnetic patches are uniformly jostled by the convection and there are no internal flows in the magnetic patches .",
    "this phenomenon occurs when the wave nonlinearity ( @xmath142 ) in the chromosphere is relatively large ( @xmath440.3 in our model ) , although further simulations are required in order to confirm the critical wave - nonlinearity values .",
    "the thread - like structures continue to exist in the corona , creating a multi - stranded coronal loop .",
    "the thread width does not have any smallest or elemental size of 300 km , as was implied by recent observations @xcite .",
    "instead , the width exhibits a power law distribution that creates smaller spatial scales with increased numerical resolution .    in our model ,",
    "the effects of compressibility , which have been neglected in rmhd , are important to drive the turbulence in the chromosphere . in the rmhd framework",
    ", the @xmath116 and @xmath143 disturbances can be expressed using scalar potentials ; this approach is based on the assumption that the wave nonlinearity is small @xcite .",
    "further , this assumption yields a zero nonlinear term in the 2.5d rmhd framework .",
    "however , the wave nonlinearity is not small ( @xmath144 in our model chromosphere ) in some cases , depending on the wave input energy , which violates the assumption of the rmhd equations .",
    "instead , the energy cascade can be driven by the nonlinear interactions , which involve compressible processes .",
    "the alfvn waves , or disturbances in the @xmath7 direction , are primary carriers of the energy flux in our simulation .",
    "this is reasonable , as only alfvn waves are driven at the bottom of simulation box , and fast and slow waves ( disturbances in the @xmath5@xmath6 plane ) are then produced by the mode conversion from the alfvn waves .",
    "the dominant wave modes in the energy flux are changed when the different types of photospheric drivers are assumed @xcite .",
    "our model only allows shear alfvn waves to exist ; however , swirling motions have recently been observed as magnetic tornadoes @xcite , which are interpreted as torsional alfvn waves rather than bulk motion , like tornadoes on earth @xcite .",
    "although the nonlinear behaviours of the shear and torsional alfvn waves become identical in the zero - plasma-@xmath145 limit , a discrepancy appears in the finite - plasma-@xmath145 case . as the nonlinear steepening of the shear alfvn waves is less effective than that of the torsional waves , our simulation overestimates the shock heating rate in the chromosphere .    the temperature and density at the loop top increase with the numerical resolution in our simulations . at first",
    ", we expect that the temperature and density should be independent of the resolution if the turbulent heating is active , or that they may even decrease with the resolution if some other scale - dependent heating acts .",
    "the increase in the temperature and density arises from the increase in the poynting flux due to the decrease in the numerical dissipation in the chromosphere . at the loop top ,",
    "the volumetric heating rate normalized by @xmath146 , where @xmath147 , is almost independent of the resolution and has a value of approximately 0.3 .",
    "this means the typical heating time scale is approximately 3 alfvn transit times .    the turbulence in the corona and that in the chromosphere have different driving mechanisms . in the corona ,",
    "the motion against magnetic pressure does not contribute significantly to the energy transfer in the wave number space since @xmath148 .",
    "on the other hand , in the chromosphere , the compression motion makes non - negligible contributions to the magnetic - energy transfer from the larger ( @xmath149 km ) to the smaller scale . in both the corona and the chromosphere ,",
    "the field stretching motion distributes the energy throughout the majority of the wave - number space .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are positioned in the @xmath6 direction in our simulation , and one important problem arising from the boundary condition must be pointed out . the resonant absorption of alfvn waves , which is considered to be very effective in the coronal loop @xcite , may be neglected , as our model does not have density gradients at the loop boundary . however , our model does reveal numerous thin threads that have density gradients inside the loop .",
    "this phenomenon could cause a self - consistent resonant absorption process @xcite , although further analysis is required in order to confirm the contribution from this process .",
    "the coronal structure was reproduced as a natural consequence of alfvn wave injection from the photosphere using 2.5d mhd simulations .",
    "the resultant coronal loop reached a quasi - steady state that obeyed the rtv scaling law .",
    "it was found that both the shock heating rate and the turbulent heating rate are almost comparable below the magnetic canopy ( 4 mm ) .",
    "the shock heating mechanism was dominated by the turbulent heating mechanism above the magnetic canopy .",
    "the coronal structure was maintained even when an unprecedentedly high spatial resolution of @xmath150 km was applied , although the resultant temperature and density continued to increase with the resolution .",
    "although the competition between the shock and turbulent heating was investigated , our model might underestimate the effect of the other important heating processes , such as the resonant absorption .",
    "further study is necessary in order to distinguish between such processes .",
    "although our 2.5d model exhibited a variety of properties compared to the previous 1d models , several important features were omitted because of the 2.5d approximation .",
    "one may speculate that a full 3d treatment would have a non - negligible impact on the mhd turbulence and the magnetic reconnection .",
    "although the finite wave nonlinearity facilitates mhd turbulence driving , even in 2.5 dimensions , the interactions achieved in that case may be smaller than those obtainable using nonlinear terms in a full 3d rmhd formulation @xcite .",
    "further , it would be possible to derive other important 3d effects from the magnetic reconnection determined via a full 3d treatment . in a 3d configuration",
    ", magnetic reconnections could occur at the locations of the thin current sheets .",
    "note that magnetic reconnection can act as an additional heating source by generating secondary mhd waves @xcite .",
    "the present study presents the first direct mhd simulation able to distinguish between the shock and turbulent heating mechanisms in a single coronal loop .",
    "the different heating mechanisms lead to different resultant coronal temperature and density profiles .",
    "since the coronal temperature and density determine the mass loss from the stellar objects , the coronal heating theory has significant impacts on the prospects not only of the present solar wind theory but also of the mass loss theory from the young sun @xcite or the other stellar objects @xcite . to fully understand",
    "the response of the solar atmosphere from the photospheric perturbation will require a wide parameter survey using the model developed here . also , we have to fill a gap between heating the closed corona and the open corona , since waves do nt behave in the same way in the two regions .",
    "the author appreciate the anonymous referee for constructive comments .",
