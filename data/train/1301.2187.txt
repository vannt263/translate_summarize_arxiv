    "the study of azimuthal anisotropy , based on fourier coefficients , is recognized as an important tool to probe the hot , dense matter created in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the first harmonic coefficient @xmath2 , called directed flow , and the second harmonic coefficient @xmath3 , called elliptic flow , have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically , while higher even - order harmonics have also garnered some attention  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , odd harmonics of order three and above were overlooked until recently  @xcite .",
    "this is because in a picture with smooth initial overlap geometry , it had been assumed that higher - order odd harmonics are required to be zero by symmetry .",
    "more recently it has been realized that event - by - event fluctuations break this symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the event plane of the detected particles approximates the plane of the participating particles and for reasonable event - plane resolutions the measured @xmath4 are not the mean values , but closer to the root - mean - square values  @xcite . as a consequence , higher - order odd harmonics carry valuable information about  hot spots \" or ",
    "lumpiness \" in the initial state of the colliding system  @xcite .",
    "the third harmonic coefficient  sometimes called triangular flow , but probably not related to triangular configurations in the initial state  is thus a new tool to study initial state fluctuations and the subsequent evolution of the collision system .",
    "it is probably related to the production of the near - side ridge  @xcite observed when correlations are studied as a function of the difference of azimuthal angles and the difference of pseudorapidities of the particles .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that @xmath0 is more sensitive to viscous effects than @xmath3 because the finer details of the higher harmonics are smoothed more by viscosity  @xcite .",
    "it also appears that the mean value of the initial state triangular eccentricity in coordinate space , from central to midcentral collisions , is independent of the geometric model used for the initial overlap  @xcite , unlike the second harmonic spatial elliptic eccentricity .",
    "this is probably because @xmath0 is an odd harmonic and dominated by fluctuations .",
    "rapidity - even @xmath2 is symmetric about midrapidity and is also dominated by fluctuations , but is complicated by the correction needed for conservation of momentum  @xcite .",
    "higher odd harmonics are thought to be less useful because of non - linear terms coming from the eccentricities of lower harmonics  @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath0 is an ideal flow harmonic to study viscosity because it is almost insensitive to the model used for the initial conditions and more sensitive to viscosity .    in order to separate the long - range correlations of interest from short - range correlations , we present measurements , based on the azimuthal angle @xmath5 , of @xmath6 \\rangle_{i \\neq j } $ } } $ ] vs.  the pseudorapidity separation = @xmath7 between the two particles ( i , j ) , fit with narrow and wide gaussians .",
    "we present results derived from the wide gaussian , for two - particle cumulants  @xcite , and for the standard event plane methods  @xcite , as a function of transverse momentum @xmath8 , pseudorapidity gap , and centrality .",
    "the pseudorapidity gap between the particles being correlated is found to be an especially important experimental variable .",
    "we compare our results to other experiments , and to both transport and hydrodynamic models .",
    "about ten million au+au collisions at @xmath1 gev have been used in this study , all acquired in the year 2004 using the star detector with a minimum bias trigger . the main time projection chamber ( tpc )",
    "@xcite of star covers pseudorapidity @xmath9 , while two forward time projection chambers ( ftpcs )  @xcite cover @xmath10 .",
    "the extended range in @xmath11 of the ftpcs was important because the analyses were done as a function of the @xmath11 gap between particles .",
    "this requirement limited the study to the data collection years when the ftpcs were operational .",
    "the centrality definition of an event is based on the number of charged tracks in the tpc with track quality cuts of @xmath12 , a distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the primary vertex less than 3 cm , and 15 or more space points out of a total of 45 .",
    "this analysis used events with vertex @xmath13 coordinate ( along the beam direction ) within 30 cm from the center of the tpc . for each centrality bin",
    ", the number of participants and binary collisions can be found in table iii of ref .",
    "in the standard event plane method  @xcite for @xmath0 , we reconstruct a third harmonic event plane @xmath14 from tpc tracks and also from ftpc tracks",
    ". for event plane reconstruction , we use tracks with transverse momentum @xmath15 gev@xmath16 , that pass within 3 cm of the primary vertex , and have at least 15 space points in the tpc acceptance @xmath17 or 5 space points in the ftpc acceptance ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is also required that the ratio of the number of actual space points to the maximum possible number of space points along each track s trajectory be greater than 0.52 . in event plane calculations ,",
    "tracks have a weighting factor @xmath18 in units of gev@xmath16 for @xmath19 gev@xmath16 , and @xmath20 gev@xmath16 for @xmath21 2 gev@xmath16 .",
    "although the star detector has good azimuthal symmetry , small acceptance effects in the calculation of the event plane azimuth were removed by the method of shifting  @xcite .",
    "when using the tpc event plane , we used the @xmath11 subevent method which provides an @xmath11 gap , but with an additional small @xmath11 gap of @xmath220.05 between the subevents  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 subevent method avoids self - correlations because the particles and the event plane are in opposite hemispheres .",
    "when using the ftpcs , we obtained the subevent plane resolution from the correlation of the two ftpcs , but then used the full event plane from both ftpcs  @xcite .",
    "this introduced a large @xmath11 gap between the particles in the tpc and the ftpc event planes .",
    "since there is no overlap between the coverage of the tpc and ftpcs , there is no possibility of self - correlation when using the ftpc event plane .",
    "we studied @xmath23 = @xmath6 \\rangle_{i \\neq j } $ } } $ ] vs.  between the two particles .",
    "for this two - particle cumulant method  @xcite , acceptance correction terms , which were generally small , were evaluated and applied .",
    "figure [ fig:2d ] shows that there is a sharp peak for tracks close in @xmath11 and at low @xmath24 .",
    "this has also been seen by phobos  @xcite .",

    "a flat background gave the same results for @xmath0 when integrated for all accepted pairs within the range @xmath25 , as described below .",

    "the narrow peak disappears above @xmath26 gev/@xmath27 , so is unlikely to be from jet correlations .",

    "figure  [ fig : pt_gaus ] shows the @xmath24 dependence of the width and amplitude of the wide gaussian fit to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaus ] .",
    "other functional forms , such as one with a constant offset are discussed below . shown",
    "are results for the 0%5% most central and 30%40% midcentral collisions . above 0.8 @xmath37 the distribution can be described by a single wide gaussian .",
    "the amplitude increases with @xmath24 and then saturates around 3 @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath8 dependence of the width depends on centrality , with the 0%5% most central data showing first an increase in the width and then a gradual decrease , while for the 30%40% central data the width appears to gradually decrease for all @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cent_gaus ] shows the centrality dependence of the width and amplitude of the wide gaussian . in peripheral collisions , the gaussian width is narrow and well constrained by the data .",
    "as the collisions become more central , the width broadens reaching beyond 1.5 units in pseudorapidity in the centrality range 10%40% .",
    "when the width of the wide gaussian becomes broader than @xmath38 , it becomes difficult , with the data from the tpc alone , to distinguish between functional forms for @xmath39 with and without a background .",
    "the data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : cent_gaus ] show the results when fitting a single wide gaussian to the tpc data alone .",
    "the upper edge of the systematic error band corresponds to a width that would allow the fit function to extend out far enough to match the ftpc data at @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we include a constant background , we can also match the ftpc and tpc data with a wide gaussian width consistent with the lower edge of the error band in fig .",
    "[ fig : cent_gaus ] . a larger acceptance in @xmath11 is required to better constrain the functional form .",
    "such a constraint could help distinguish between different physical mechanisms underlying the signal , such as stochastic fluctuations in the hydrodynamic phase  @xcite or decoherence of flux - tube like structures in the longitudinal direction  @xcite .",
    "whether using the tpc data only or also including the ftpc data , the width of the wide gaussian peak tends to become more narrow for the most central collisions than is observed for midcentral collisions .",
    "the rise and then fall of the width of @xmath39 mimics the rise and fall of the low @xmath24 ridge amplitude reported in ref .",
    "reference  @xcite describes this centrality trend in terms of participant eccentricity fluctuations , where the fluctuations in midcentral collisions are well above statistical expectations .",
    "this can be attributed to the asymmetry of the overlap region of the colliding nucleons which allows a nucleon on the periphery of one nucleus to impinge on many nucleons in the center of the other nucleus thus amplifying the effect of fluctuations of nucleon positions in the periphery of the nucleus .",
    "thus the width of @xmath39 and the amplitude of the low @xmath24 ridge may be related to the same fluctuations .",
    "first we will show @xmath0 vs.  @xmath11 using two standard event plane methods , followed by @xmath0 vs.  @xmath24 for these methods and also for the wide gaussian two - particle correlation .",
    "finally , we present the integrated @xmath0 vs.  centrality for these methods and also for the two - particle cumulant method  @xcite with an @xmath11 gap .",
    "results in all the figures are presented with only statistical errors unless stated otherwise .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta ] shows the @xmath11 dependence of @xmath0 using two event plane methods . for particles in the tpc using the opposite @xmath11 subevent for the event plane , @xmath0 is slightly peaked at midrapidity . with the event plane in the ftpcs",
    "there is a large @xmath11 gap between the particles and the plane , and @xmath0 is flat for all centralities .",
    "this flatness means that acceptance effects at the edges of the tpc are not significant .",
    "thus , even though a large in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaus ] means that one of the particles must be at large @xmath11 in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] , this evidently is not a significant effect on the flatness of the dependence .",

    "the results for the wide gaussian method with either kind of weighting are almost the same as those for the tpc using subevent planes , meaning that for either of these two methods the narrow gaussian does not significantly affect the wide gaussian . however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftpc ] the results with the event plane in the ftpcs are considerably lower , presumably because of the larger @xmath11 gap to be discussed in sec .",

    "for @xmath45 without a cut the curve would be a factor of two higher for peripheral collisions and off scale .",
    "systematic uncertainties have been estimated by varying the dca track cuts and the number of fit points , the event cut of vertex @xmath13 , and the event plane flattening method .",
    "these uncertainties have been combined in quadrature to obtain the systematic uncertainties shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cent ] .",
    "the correlation of the third and second harmonic event planes was investigated by @xmath46 and within the statistical uncertainties was found to be consistent with zero for this data set .",
    "this is reasonable for this mixed harmonic result since observing the correlation between the third and second harmonic event planes requires a three particle correlation analysis to fix the direction of the first harmonic event plane [ 5 ] .      clearly",
    "the various analysis methods for @xmath44 differ greatly in fig .",
    "[ fig : cent ] .",

    "the nonflow contributions due to short range correlations , seen as the narrow gaussian in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaus ] , are effectively suppressed by using either the wide gaussian or by an @xmath11 gap .",
    "this result is consistent with previous studies of elliptic flow based on two - particle correlations , but in a previous work the corresponding wide gaussian was ascribed to mini - jet correlations  @xcite .",
