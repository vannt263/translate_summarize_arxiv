    "one transitional disk target that has garnered particular attention in recent years is , a 35 myr old @xmath01  @xmath1 star located approximately 140 pc away @xcite in the taurus - auriga region .",
    "a wide gap in the disk extending out to @xmath050au can be inferred from the infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ; @xcite ) , but it has also been spatially resolved both in scattered light at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite and in thermal emission at mm / sub - mm wavelengths @xcite . in near - infrared images , the outer edge of the gap appears off - center from the star , suggesting an eccentric gap @xcite , although the mm / sub - mm images are consistent with a circular gap @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite discovered a protoplanet candidate at @xmath01621au using sparse aperture masking ( sam ) . while some follow - up observations only provided upper limits @xcite ,",
    "newest results from h@xmath2 differential imaging confirm the accreting protoplanet hypothesis ( k.  follette , p.c . ) .    here",
    "we present new scattered - light images of the lkca  15 disk taken at visible wavelengths using polarimetric differential imaging ( pdi ) .",
    "the observations provide better spatial resolution and a more robust determination of the distribution of reflected light from the disk than previous data based on infrared angular differential imaging ( adi ) , in which forward modeling is necessary to account for self - subtraction effects @xcite .",
    "lkca 15 was observed on two nights during science verification time for the newly commissioned high - contrast imager sphere ( spectro - polarimetric high - contrast exoplanet research ; @xcite ) at the european southern observatory s very large telescope facility .",
    "its visible - light instrument , zimpol ( zurich imaging polarimeter , @xcite ) , was used with the extreme adaptive optics system ( saxo ; @xcite ) to obtain deep imaging polarimetry in the ` very broad band ' filter spanning the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands ( 590890 nm ) .",
    "zimpol offers extreme polarimetric contrast @xcite at a pixel scale of 3.6mas@xmath57.2mas and a field of view of 35@xmath535 .    the first observation , on 2015 - 02 - 02 , comprised seven polarimetric cycles of four half - wave plate positions ( stokes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , each exposed for 8 @xmath5 20 seconds at a time , for a total integration time of 75 minutes . the second observation was executed in the same way on 2015 - 02 - 12 .",
    "the exposure time had been chosen to saturate the star s point - spread function ( psf ) to maximize sensitivity at larger separations . however , the performance of the adaptive optics was poor and highly variable throughout both observations , which rendered the star unsaturated in most frames and yielded a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath035mas ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this can be ascribed to lkca  15 s apparent magnitude of @xmath11mag at the faint limit of saxo s guide star specifications , combined with unfavorable weather conditions and high airmass ( @xmath01.5 ) .",
    "furthermore , a `` comet - tail '' aberration of the psf core is observed in some frames , likely caused by malfunction of the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) . after correcting the raw zimpol data for cosmetics and field distortion , we applied the pdi data reduction method detailed in @xcite .",
    "it includes the following steps for reducing instrumental polarization : ( 1 ) flux equalization of each simultaneous pair of raw images in order to remove the polarization of the stellar psf , ( 2 ) double - quotient calculation of stokes @xmath12 and @xmath13 polarized flux images for each polarimetric cycle , ( 3 ) empirical correction of polarimetric throughput differences in stokes @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and ( 4 ) empirical correction of angular misalignment of the half - wave plate .",
    "lastly , we transform the cartesian coordinate system of the stokes formalism @xmath14 into a polar coordinate system @xmath15 in which positive @xmath16 polarization is defined as azimuthal with respect to the star @xcite . under the single - scattering assumption",
    ", the scattering polarization should appear in the @xmath16 image ( typically as positive signal ) , whereas the @xmath17 image should contain no scattered - light signal and can be used to estimate the noise level in the observation @xcite . while this assumption does not strictly hold for inclined , optically thick disks , as is the case for lkca  15 , the resulting deviations are small and automatically accounted for in the error estimation @xcite .",
    "since we find no significant differences between the two epochs , we combine both data sets into one final set of stokes @xmath18 images , which improves the quality of the results . since the data are sensitivity - limited , we apply no frame selection .",
    "we convolve the polarization images with a circular aperture of 7 pixels (= 25mas ) in diameter to reduce shot noise .",
    "and @xmath17 polarized flux images , respectively . assuming single scattering",

    "the inner disk component also sheds light on the extent of the gap as inferred from previous non - resolved observations . proposed a three - component structure with an outer disk at @xmath050au consistent with the millimeter cavity , an inner disk starting at the dust sublimation radius to explain the near - infrared flux , and an optically thin component out to @xmath05au to explain the prominent silicate emission feature .",
    "our detection of scattered light between 730au shows illuminated dust is present at these locations above the disk mid plane .",
    "an extrapolation of the gap wall temperature ( @xmath81k@xmath82 ) yields a temperature of 150250k , consistent with the presence of the 10 and 20@xmath83 m silicate emission feature in the sed .",
    "we hypothesize that this new scattering structure represents the optically thin part of the inner disk extending out to at least 30au .",
    "a quick adaptation of the disk model from @xcite indicates that this can be reconciled with the sed , since the contribution of the optically thin part to the sed is minor .",
    "this geometry ( narrow gap , depleted inner disk , millimeter cavity ) qualitatively matches the imprint of a single planet on a disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "our @xmath25-band polarimetry confirms the prediction from @xmath22-band adi forward - modeling @xcite that the outer boundary of the gap in the lkca  15 disk appears off - centered in reflected light , with a highly significant offset of @xmath76mas ( a third of the gap s projected radius ) between the star and the gap s apparent center .",
    "while disk gaps are known to vary in size as a function of observed wavelength in systems with planet - induced dust filtering @xcite , a lateral displacement of the gap is more difficult to justify and has not been predicted by numerical simulations .    the outer disk s vertical structure can not account for this displacement since the gap wall profile is tapered ( ` round ' ) rather than vertical @xcite .",
    "this is qualitatively confirmed by the wide , homogeneous distribution of scattered light in fig .",
    "[ f : images]d .",
    "another explanation is provided by shadowing .",
    "originally proposed an inner disk coplanar with the outer disk , casting a shadow onto the outer disk s inner wall @xcite .",
    "our forward modeling in @xcite achieved significantly better fits with an unshadowed gap wall , which led us to speculate that the inner disk  and its shadow  were tilted out of the outer disk s plane . on the other hand , this arrangement should result in dark lanes cutting across the outer disk where the shadow plane intersects it , as seen in hd  142527 @xcite .",
    "no such lanes are apparent in the lkca  15 imagery .",
    "this conundrum can be resolved if the inner disk has a slightly higher inclination than the outer disk ( fig .",
    "[ f : sketch ] ) .",
    "the near - side disk rim as observed from earth would then be fully exposed to stellar irradiation , whereas the far - side disk surface would be obscured at the rim and only become visible further out where the disk surface flares out of the shadow .",
    "this would create an off - centered apparent gap in reflected light even with a symmetric physical disk gap .",
    "for the disk architecture in @xcite , the requisite differential tilt would be of order 1@xmath24 , which could be induced by a planet on a tilted orbit ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . a similar effect could be caused by a shadowing structure vertically extending from an otherwise coplanar inner disk @xcite , though this would imply dramatic variability on the timescale from days to years .",
    "while we can not exclude this possibility , we find no significant variability in our observations ( @xcite ; this work ) .",
