    "we take some median values with 50% uncertainties : @xmath137 and @xmath138 note that @xmath0 is almost an order of magnitude larger than @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and is the most important of the three .",
    "the strange quark parameters are placed at  @xcite @xmath139 these uncertainties are assigned conservatively and in accord with the state - of - the - art in the literature . while some may argue that some values are better known , others may find that the errors are underestimated . in any event",
    ", one will learn how the uncertainties in the qcd parameters are mapped into uncertainties in the phenomenological fit parameters . in the numerical analysis",
    "below , we will also examine how the spectral parameters depend on different uncertainty assignments in these input parameters .      to extract the magnetic moments ,",
    "a two - stage fit was performed .",
    "first , the corresponding chiral - odd mass sum rule , as obtained previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , was fitted to get the mass @xmath140 , the coupling @xmath141 and the continuum threshold @xmath142 .",
    "then , @xmath140 and @xmath141 were used in the magnetic moment sum rule for a three - parameter fit : the transition strength @xmath143 , the continuum threshold @xmath144 , and the magnetic moment @xmath45 . note that @xmath142 and @xmath144 are not necessarily the same .",
    "we impose a physical constraint on both @xmath142 and @xmath144 requiring that they are larger than the mass , and discard qcd parameter sets that do not satisfy this condition . in the actual analysis of the sum rules",
    ", however , we found that a full search was not always successful .",
    "in such cases , the search algorithm consistently returned @xmath144 either zero or smaller than @xmath140 .",
    "this signals insufficient information in the ope to completely resolve the spectral parameters . to proceed",
    ", we fixed @xmath144 at @xmath142 , which is a commonly - adopted choice in the literature , and searched for @xmath143 and @xmath45 .",
    "the two - stage fit incorporates the uncertainties from the two - point functions in a correlated fashion into the three - point functions , and represents a more realistic scenario .    to illustrate how well a sum rule works , we first cast it into the subtracted form , @xmath145 then plot the logarithm of the absolute value of the two sides against the inverse of @xmath146 . in this way , the right - hand side will appear as a straight line whose slope is @xmath147 and whose intercept with the y - axis gives some measure of the coupling strength and the magnetic moment .",
    "the linearity ( or deviation from it ) of the left - hand side gives an indication of ope convergence , and information on the continuum model and the transitions .",
    "the two sides are expected to match for a good sum rule .",
    "this way of matching the sum rules is similar to looking for a ` plateau ' as a function of borel mass in the conventional analysis , but has the advantage of not restricting the analysis regime in borel space to the valid regimes common to _ both _ two - point and three - point correlation functions .",
    "we have analyzed all of the sum rules for the entire decuplet family .",
    "we confirmed the three relations among magnetic moments as extended from eqs .",
    "( [ exact1 ] ) to  ( [ exact3 ] ) .",
    "so we will only present results for seven members .",
    "valid sum rules were identified using the criteria discussed earlier .",
    "the results are given in three tables : tables  [ tabdo ] to  [ tabxi ] .",
    "the corresponding overlap plots are given in seven figures : figs .",
    "[ rhslhs - delpp ] to  [ rhslhs - xim ] .",
    "these plots show how well a sum rule performs in the entire borel region .",
    "such information is absent in the tables . from the results ,",
    "the following observations are in order .",
    "in general , more chiral - even sum rules are valid than chiral - odd ones .",
    "this is consistent with previous findings for the octet baryon magnetic moments .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the interval of dimensions ( not counting the dimension of @xmath9 ) in the chiral - even sum rules ( 0 to 8) is larger than that in the chiral - odd sum rules ( 1 to 7 ) . indeed , more chiral - even sum rules ( we@xmath148 , we@xmath149 , we@xmath150 , we@xmath151 , we@xmath152 , we@xmath153 ) have power corrections up to @xmath154 , than chiral - odd ones ( wo@xmath148 , wo@xmath149 , wo@xmath152 , wo@xmath153 ) .",
    "because of the additional terms in the ope series , these sum rules are expected to be more reliable than the other sum rules .",
    "the situation here is almost opposite to that for the two - point functions  @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that chiral - odd sum rules are more reliable than chiral - even sum rules for baryon two - point functions .",
    "the reason could be traced to the fact that even and odd parity excited states contribute with different signs . in the three - point functions ,",
    "however , the statement is no longer valid due to the appearance of transitions and vacuum susceptibilities .",
    "therefore , caution should be used when applying the chirality argument to determine the reliability of a sum rule in three - point functions .",
    "in addition , numerical analysis showed that the sum rules from we@xmath117 , we@xmath155 , wo@xmath117 are valid for the standard input parameter set , despite the absence of @xmath154 terms .",
    "we have varied the central values of the input parameters and discovered that sum rules that were valid for one set of input parameters became invalid for another , and _",
    "vice versa_. thus the situation with three - point functions is more complicated .",
    "our experience is that each sum rule should be examined individually in order to find out its reliability .",
    "it turns out that for most of the valid sum rules , a full search was unsuccessful , except for three sum rules : we@xmath150 , we@xmath151 and we@xmath152 for @xmath156 .",
    "of the three , only we@xmath151 returned a continuum threshold with reasonable error .",
    "the other two returned it with large errors .",
    "the large errors indicate that the sum rules are not very stable : they contain barely enough information to completely resolve the spectral parameters .. the important point is that the results with the continuum threshold searched or not are almost the same .",
    "this suggests that fixing it to that of the corresponding two - point function seems a good approximation .",
    "it is gratifying to observe that the valid sum rules for most members give consistent predictions for the magnetic moments in terms of the sign , except for @xmath157 and @xmath66 whose magnitudes are small .",
    "the magnitudes for the magnetic moments are consistent within errors for the most part , with only a few exceptions .",
    "the performances of the sum rules are quite different within each member .",
    "this is best displayed in the overlap plots . in some sum rules , the overlap is poor , as evidenced by the deviation from linearity ( dotted lines ) .",
    "it signals poor ope convergence in these sum rules .",
    "as expected , the deviation is more severe in the lower end of the borel region where nonperturbative physics dominates .",
    "these sum rules will more likely suffer from uncertainties associated with the selection of the borel window . as a result , the spectral parameters extracted from them are less reliable .",
    "one way to alleviate the problem is to increase the lower end of the borel window to values where the overlap is good , even to extend the upper end to ensure the existence of a window .",
    "this was not attempted in this work because we feel the results obtained this way are somewhat misleading .",
    "the reason is that the sum rules in these windows will be dominated mostly by perturbative physics .",
    "it is common knowledge that if one goes deep enough into the borel space , one can always find a match in a qcd sum rule .",
    "but such practice is against the philosophy of the qcd sum rule approach , which relies upon the power corrections to resolve the spectral properties .",
    "therefore , some standard is necessary to emphasize such physics , and we feel the 10%-50% criteria adopted here are a reasonable choice .    based on the quality of the overlap , the broadness of the borel window and its reach into the lower end , the size of the continuum contribution , and the standard qcd input parameter set , we designate one sum rule for each member as the most favorable .",
    "they are we@xmath150 for @xmath1 , we@xmath150 for @xmath156 , wo@xmath152 for @xmath157 , we@xmath150 for @xmath158 , wo@xmath152 for @xmath66 , we@xmath150 for @xmath103 , and we@xmath150 for @xmath159 .",
    "the selection is undoubtedly subjective .",
    "the reader may find a different set that have equal or comparable performance .",
    "we want to stress that such a selection depends on the qcd input parameters .",
    "it is possible that the ones selected here become invalid for a different set of input parameters , in which case a new set should be selected .",
    "relatively large errors were found in the valid sum rules using the standard qcd input parameter set : from 50% to 100% in the magnetic moments .",
    "but in most cases , the sign and order of magnitudes are unambiguously predicted when compared to the measured values .",
    "the situation is similar to a previous finding on @xmath160  @xcite . to gain some idea on how the uncertainties depend on the input",
    ", we also analyzed the sum rules by adjusting the error estimates individually .",
    "we found large sensitivities to the quark condensate magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , most of the errors came from the uncertainties in @xmath0 .",
    "we also tried with reduced error estimates on all the qcd input parameters : 10% relative errors uniformly .",
    "it leads to about 30% accuracy on the magnetic moments in the favorable sum rules .",
    "further improvement of the accuracy by reducing the errors in the input is beyond the capability of these sum rules as the @xmath161 becomes unacceptably large , signaling internal inconsistency of the sum rules . for that purpose , one would have to resort to finding sum rules that have better convergence properties and depend less critically on the poorly - known @xmath0 .    to get a different perspective on how the spectral parameters depend on the input parameters",
    ", we study correlations among the parameters by way of scatter plots . in the monte - carlo analysis , all the parameters are correlated .",
    "therefore , one can study the correlations between any two parameters by looking at their scatter plots .",
    "such plots are useful in revealing how a particular sum rule resolves the spectral properties .",
    "we have examined numerous such plots . here",
    "we focus on the favorable sum rules as selected earlier . to conserve space ,",
    "we only give two examples .",
    "[ corr - omeg - we5 ] shows the scatter plot for correlations between @xmath2 magnetic moment and the qcd input parameters for the sum rule from we@xmath150 .",
    "[ corr - sig0-wo8 ] shows a similar plot for @xmath67 and the sum rule from wo@xmath152 .",
    "perhaps the most interesting feature is the strong correlations with @xmath0 in both sum rules .",
    "this is the reason for the large sensitivities to this parameter as alluded to earlier .",
    "precise determination of @xmath0 is crucial for keeping the uncertainties in the spectral parameters under control .",
    "other charged members ( all use sum rules from we@xmath150 ) display qualitatively the same patterns for parameters other than @xmath0 and the factorization violation parameter @xmath92 . for @xmath0 ,",
    "positively - charged members ( @xmath1 and @xmath65 ) show negative correlations .",
    "the opposite is true for negatively - charged members ( @xmath2 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) : they show positive correlations with @xmath0 . the patterns for @xmath92 essentially follow those for @xmath0 , although the correlations are weaker .",
    "the correlation patterns for @xmath66 are qualitatively the same as those for @xmath67 .",
    "table  [ comp ] shows a comparison of the magnetic moments from various calculations and existing experimental data .",
    "the results with 10% errors from the qcd sum rule method are used in the comparison .",
    "note that the central values are slightly different from those in tables  [ tabdo ] to  [ tabxi ] where conservative uncertainties were used .",
    "the reason is that the resultant distributions vary with input errors and are not gaussian in this case . in such event",
    "the median and the average of the asymmetric errors are quoted .",
    "the qcdsr results are consistent with data , although the central value for @xmath2 is slightly underestimated .",
    "we would like to point out that it is possible to reproduce the central value for @xmath2 ( using it as input ) by fine - tuning of the susceptibility @xmath0 alone , given the sensitivity to this parameter and the large freedom at the present time on its value .",
    "however , we feel that such an attempt is not very meaningful given the accuracy of the method",
    ". a more meaningful practice would be to re - analyze the octet baryon magnetic moments by the same method as employed here , and obtain a best fit on the the susceptibilities using their accurately measured values , then use them to predict the decuplet magnetic moments .",
    "it would yield valuable information on these important quantities and on the consistency of the approach . from the table",
    ", it is fair to say that the qcdsr approach is at least competitive with other calculations .",
    "the results came about from a rather different perspective : the nonperturbative structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the results from various calculations roughly agree , except for the charge - neutral resonances @xmath6 , @xmath157 , and @xmath66 for which both the sign and the magnitude vary . it would be helpful to have experimental information on the other members of the decuplet , although such measurements appear difficult .",
    "it has been demonstrated in this work that the magnetic moments of decuplet baryons can be successfully computed in the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "a complete set of qcd sum rules are derived using the external field technique .",
    "they are analyzed extensively with a comprehensive monte - carlo based procedure which , in our opinion , provides the most realistic estimates of the uncertainties present in the approach .",
    "valid sum rules are identified using criteria established by ope convergence and ground - state dominance . for each member ,",
    "usually several sum rules are valid , but not all of them perform equally well .",
    "this was best displayed by the overlap plots .",
    "some have large deviations in the lower end of the borel window , signaling insufficient convergence in the ope .",
    "these sum rules are less reliable . based on overall performance ,",
    "a favorable sum rule was selected for each member .",
    "they are we@xmath150 for charged members , wo@xmath152 for charge - neutral members .",
    "we also found the following relations between the magnetic moments : @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 , and approximately @xmath165 . .",
    "using conservative estimates of the qcd input parameters , the uncertainties in the extracted magnetic moments are found relatively large as compared to the two - point functions .",
    "we found that the results are sensitive to the quark condensate magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , most of the uncertainties could be attributed to @xmath0 .",
    "better estimate of this parameter is clearly needed . by varying the uncertainty estimates in the input parameters",
    ", we found that a 30% accuracy can be achieved with the designated sum rules if the qcd input parameters could be determined to the 10% accuracy level .",
