    "the polarization of a medium by a moving charged particle gives rise to a number of radiation processes .",
    "well - known examples are cherenkov , transition and diffractions radiations . in particular ,",
    "many aspects of transition radiation , both theoretical and experimental , have been investigated in numerous publications ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "transition radiation is produced when a relativistic particle traverses an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "such radiation has a number of remarkable properties and at present it has found many important applications . in particular ,",
    "optical and extreme ultraviolet transition radiation from metallic targets observed in backward direction was used for the measurement of transverse size , divergence and energy of electron and proton beams ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the modern accelerators allow us to produce electron beams consisting of trains of short bunches with subpicosecond duration @xcite .",
    "the conventional diagnostic tools do not provide the required measurement accuracy and the development of new reliable and economic diagnostic techniques is the actual task .",
    "such techniques based on different radiation mechanisms ( for instance , transition radiation ) are widely used @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of a bunch profile is carried out using the fourier transformation of the measured spectrum of coherent transition radiation @xcite . recently a technique is proposed based on the smith - purcell radiation spectral measurements @xcite .",
    "the advantages of such kind of diagnostics are due to the fact that the smith - purcell radiation spectral distribution is quasimonochromatic .",
    "but because of the weak radiation intensity the usage of the proposed technique meets with troubles @xcite .",
    "we propose to use the transition radiation from periodically deformed targets instead of the smith - purcell radiation mechanism for beam diagnostic . in this case",
    "the radiation intensity is much higher but , as we show below , the spectral distribution becomes quasimonochromatic similar to the smith - purcell radiation and the abovementioned advantages are retained .",
    "the main part of the investigations of transition radiation considers flat interfaces separating the media with different optical properties .",
    "very few works have been devoted to the transition radiation from rough surfaces bagh76 .",
    "a periodic structure of the separating interface can serve as an additional tool for the control of the spectral - angular distribution of the transition radiation .",
    "in general , the problem does not allow an analytic solution and approximate or numerical methods should be used .",
    "an integral method to study transition radiation from interfaces with arbitrary profile was considered in @xcite .",
    "the method is a generalization of that previously discussed in @xcite for the case of the smith - purcell radiation .",
    "relatively simple and physically more transparent expressions for the radiation intensity are obtained by using various approximations .",
    "in particular , the investigation of the transition radiation from regular - roughness interface is carried out in @xcite under the assumption that the dielectric permittivities of the media separated by the interface are close to each other . the same approximation scheme has been used in @xcite for the investigation of the radiation intensity from a charge or bunches flying over a surface waves .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the transition radiation on an interface with arbitrary periodic profile and for an arbitrary incidence angle of a charged particle .",
    "in particular , the function describing the profile can also be time dependent . this type of dynamical interface may be realized by surface waves propagating on the boundary of two media .",
    "the investigation will be done within the framework of the perturbation theory with respect to the small difference of the dielectric permittivities of the media . in particular , the corresponding condition is satisfied for the x - ray transition radiation .",
    "another example is that when for a part of the medium the dielectric permittivity is changed by some external influences , for example , intense electromagnetic waves or acoustic waves .",
    "these changes are much smaller than the corresponding unperturbed permittivities and their effects are well described by the perturbation theory .",
    "transition radiation on a superlattice created by acoustic waves has been discussed previously in @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned perturbation theory in general form with a number of applications is reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results can in certain cases be used to estimate the effects in more complicated configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we obtain the formula for the spectral - angular density of the radiated energy for a general profile function .",
    "the formulas are given for separate polarizations , as well as for the total intensity .",
    "special cases , which include diffraction gratings and surface waves excited on the interface , are discussed in section [ sec : special ] .",
    "numerical examples for the both angular and spectral distributions of the radiated energy are considered in section sec : numerical .",
    "the main results are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "first let us consider the general case of a medium with dielectric permittivity@xmath0where @xmath1 is a constant and @xmath2 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 the electric and magnetic fields created by the radiation source in a homogeneous medium with permittivity @xmath1 . presenting the corresponding fields in the medium with permittivity ( [ eps ] ) in the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 and substituting into the maxwell equations",
    ", we can see that , in the first approximation with respect to the small quantity @xmath7 and @xmath8 obey the inhomogeneous maxwell equations with the charge density @xmath9 and current density @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , in the same approximation , the spectral - angular distribution of the radiated energy is given by the formula @xcite@xmath11where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , are independent unit vectors of the polarization , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the frequency and wave vector of the radiated photon , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the solid angle element . in ( [",
    "int]),@xmath18and the separate terms in the sum over @xmath19 give the radiated energy for the corresponding polarization .",

    "examples of this type of peaks will be given below .",
    "note that the condition ( [ condpeak ] ) does not depend on the form of the profile function and is completely determined by the periodicity properties of the interface .",
    "in deriving the expressions for the spectral - angular distribution of the radiation intensity we have assumed that the charge of the radiating particle is fixed .",
    "new features may arise in the case of the transition radiation from multiply charged ions .",
    "in particular , as a result of the interaction with medium the ion can gain or lose charge .",
    "the transition radiation on a flat interface , by taking into account this effect , has been recently discussed in @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate the transition radiation on a periodically deformed interface between two dielectric media . under the assumption that the dielectric permittivities of the media are close , </S>",
    "<S> a formula is derived for the spectral - angular distribution of the radiated energy in the general case of a nonstatic profile function for the separating boundary . in particular , the latter includes the case of surface waves propagating along the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical examples are given for triangular grating and for sinusoidal profile . </S>",
    "<S> we show that instead of a single peak in the backward transition radiation on a flat interface , for periodic interface one has a set of peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the number and the locations of the peaks depend on the incidence angle of the charge and on the period of the interface . the conditions are specified for their appearance . </S>"
