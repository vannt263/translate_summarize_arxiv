    "the theory of bardeen , cooper and schrieffer@xcite ( bcs ) to describe the superconducting properties of metallic materials is now more than fifty years old .",
    "an exact bethe ansatz solution in the case of a reduced bcs hamiltonian with uniform coupling parameters was obtained by richardson and sherman@xcite .",

    "some time later it was shown that this system is integrable,@xcite and following on from this the integrability and exact solution were unified through approaches involving the quantum inverse scattering method based on the yang - baxter equation,@xcite and gaudin algebra methods.@xcite from those developments up to the present day , the @xmath1-wave pairing model has continued to be the subject of many investigations including the implementation of numerical techniques for solving the associated bethe ansatz equations,@xcite studies using analytic methods,@xcite the computation of correlation functions,@xcite and quantum dynamics,@xcite and relations to conformal field theory.@xcite    there have also been several searches for examples of integrable , exactly solvable bcs hamiltonians which go beyond the @xmath1-wave case . some examples were found whereby integrability was maintained by the inclusion of additional interaction terms besides the familiar pair - scattering interaction.@xcite recently , it was also found that integrability holds in the case of @xmath2-wave pairing.@xcite an interesting feature of the @xmath2-wave pairing case is that the model has a non - trivial ground - state phase diagram , in contrast to the @xmath1-wave model .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the next in the sequence , a hamiltonian with @xmath0-wave pairing,@xcite also admits an exact solution and if so what is the predicted phase diagram ? within the typical ( lie algebraic ) ansatz for the model s eigenfunctions , a recent study@xcite indicates that the answer is negative regarding the existence of an exact solution . here",
    "we will show that with the inclusion of additional interactions , of the same quadratic number operator type as those encountered in earlier studies,@xcite an exact solution can be obtained .",
    "our approach uses the same conserved operators as those of the @xmath1-wave model , but the hamiltonian is constructed via a different combination .",
    "we examine the continuum limit of the bethe ansatz equations , and the gap and chemical potential equations from mean - field theory for the ground state , and find that these agree .",
    "the mean - field equations point to the existence of a critical point where the excitation spectrum is gapless .",

    "now we will argue that this solution corresponds to the ground state of the hamiltonian , by making comparison between the exact solution and results obtained from a mean - field approximation of the hamiltonian . using a mean - field approximation",

    "we will assume that the total fermion number is even , so all fermions are paired in the ground state .",
    "setting @xmath132 gives a mean - field approximation for ( [ ham1 ] ) ( up to a canonical transformation ) , while setting @xmath133 gives a mean - field approximation for ( [ nham ] ) .",
    "keeping @xmath134 as a free variable allows us to interpolate between these two cases .    setting @xmath135 and @xmath136",
    "the ground - state energy is found to be @xmath137 associated to the mean - field ground state @xmath138 where @xmath139 .",
    "it is seen that the excitation spectrum becomes gapless in the limit @xmath140 when @xmath141 .    through use of the hellmann - feynman theorem we may take partial derivatives of ( [ hamiltonianmean ] ) and ( [ energymean ] ) to generate the following constraint equations : @xmath142 combining eqs . ( [ hf1],[hf3 ] )",
    "gives @xmath143 equivalently , the explicit expression for @xmath1 in term of @xmath134 and @xmath70 leads to @xmath144 using ( [ hf1],[hf2],[hf3 ] ) the energy expression ( [ energymean ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath145 which is consistent with ( [ hamilonian ] ) .",
    "first we consider the integrable case @xmath133 for which ( [ hf1mod0 ] ) reduces to @xmath146 expressing ( [ spectra ] ) as @xmath147 we have @xmath148 identifying @xmath149 in the continuum limit we find that ( [ hf1mod],[hf2 ] ) and @xmath104 calculated through ( [ e1 ] ) coincide with the exact solution expressions ( [ equation1],[equation2 ] ) and @xmath104 calculated through ( [ equation3 ] ) respectively .",
    "this gives confidence that the mean - field approximation is valid when @xmath133 , while simultaneously showing that the solution found in the continuum limit in sect .",
    "[ cl ] does correspond to the ground state of the system .",
    "gapless excitations in the mean - field analysis arise when @xmath141 which , from ( [ hf1mod ] ) , corresponds to @xmath150 independent of @xmath99 .",
    "the above relation is exactly the condition for dressing states , presented in sect .",
    "[ hamint ] .",
    "finally we consider the mean - field equations for general @xmath151 when @xmath141 . here",
    "we deduce from ( [ hf1],[hf2],[hf3 ] ) that the excitation spectrum is gapless when @xmath152 qualitatively , the @xmath0-wave case where @xmath132 and the extended @xmath0-wave case with @xmath133 are very similar at the level of the mean - field analysis . for fixed @xmath99 , in both instances there is at most one value of the coupling @xmath9 at which the spectrum may be gapless .",
    "one significant difference however is that gapless excitations for the case @xmath132 can only occur when @xmath153 , whereas for @xmath133 gapless excitations occur for all filling fractions .    for non - zero @xmath48",
    "we find when @xmath141 @xmath154 . alternatively setting @xmath155 and keeping @xmath156 we obtain @xmath157 .",
    "the case @xmath132 was studied by read and green@xcite who suggested that the @xmath141 limit is identified with a critical point for which the ground state is the _ haldane - rezayi _",
    "state.@xcite however the situation is much the same for generic @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath158 denote the projection operator onto the subpsace for @xmath38 cooper pairs .",
    "if we take the projected mean - field ground state at @xmath141 ( with @xmath159 ) we obtain @xmath160 for some normalisation constant @xmath161 .",
    "( [ dressed ] ) is exactly the dressing of the vacuum state that was discussed in sect .",
    "[ hamint ] , and appeared in sect .",
    "[ cl ] in the context of the bethe ansatz solution .",
    "thus the projected mean - field ground state ( [ dressed ] ) for the critical point at which the excitation spectrum is gapless ( @xmath141 ) is seen to have a universal character in that it is independent of both @xmath134 and @xmath9 .",
    "using the conserved operators and bethe ansatz equations of the richardson - gaudin pairing hamiltonian we obtained an integrable , exactly solvable , extended @xmath0-wave system .",
    "this model is curious in that the energy expression depends quadratically on the roots of the bethe ansatz equations , and also in that the bethe ansatz equations involve terms which do not allow for an electrostatic analogy .",
    "nonetheless we were still able to study this system by solving the singular integral equation obtained from the bethe ansatz equations in the continuum limit .",
    "we also showed that these results and those obtained in a mean - field approximation coincide . for a general hamiltonian with two coupling parameters ( which includes the integrable case )",
    "it was found that the projected mean - field ground - state is universal at the critical point of gapless excitations .",
    "this suggests that results from the exactly solvable extended @xmath0-wave system may prove fruitful in understanding the @xmath0-wave system .",
    "a precedent for such an approach has been set in the different context of spin ladder systems , whereby it has been shown that extended exactly solvable hamiltonians can provide extremely useful tools for making comparisons between theoretical calculations and experimental data.@xcite",
