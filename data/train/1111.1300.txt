    "during the past decade there has been considerable experimental development in the determination of neutrino masses and mixings @xcite . recently",
    ", t2k experiment @xcite has given unambiguous hints of a relatively large 1 - 3 mixing angle .",
    "in this light , it is natural to look for models which , naturally , accommodate a non - zero value of reactor mixing angle while the atmospheric mixing angle remains near its maximal value .",
    "recently many papers have appeared which reproduce the relatively large value of the reactor mixing angle @xcite .",
    "+ there are mainly two approaches to explain neutrino mixings : 1 ) mass independent textures @xcite which lead to mixing matrices independent of the eigenvalues .",
    "the most celebrated example of this category is the tribimaximal ( tbm ) @xcite scenario which has been derived from family symmetries and predicts a vanishing 1 - 3 mixing angle @xmath2 , maximal 2 - 3 mixing angle @xmath3 and 1 - 2 mixing angle @xmath4 = @xmath5 .",
    "non - zero @xmath6 can be accommodated in tbm and other similar models by considering deviations from symmetry",
    ". + 2 ) mass dependent textures which induce relations between mixing matrix elements and mass eigenvalues .",
    "such textures naturally accommodate a non - zero @xmath6 .",
    "some examples of these are zero textures @xcite , vanishing minors @xcite , hybrid textures @xcite .",
    "zero textures have been particularly successful in explaining both the quark and the lepton masses and mixings .",
    "+ in this work we identify a class of mass dependent textures which supplemented with the assumption of a large value of effective neutrino mass @xmath7 naturally predict near maximal @xmath8 and non - zero @xmath6 .",
    "recently , it was shown by grimus _",
    "et al _ @xcite that near maximal atmospheric mixing is predicted for class b3 and b4 of two zero textures supplemented with the assumption of quasi degeneracy .",
    "we consider two vanishing minors of the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis together with the assumption of large @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption is well motivated by the extensive search for this parameter in the ongoing experiments .",
    "we found that the two cases of two vanishing minors viz . @xmath0 and @xmath1 [ table 1 ] in the limit of large @xmath7 predict near maximal atmospheric mixing and this property holds irrespective of the values of solar and reactor mixing angles . the seesaw mechanism @xcite is regarded as the prime candidate for understanding the scale of neutrino masses . in the framework of type - i seesaw mechanism ,",
    "the effective majorana mass matrix @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath12 is the right - handed majorana mass matrix . in the framework of type - i seesaw mechanism",
    "@xmath9 is a quantity derived from @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , zeros of @xmath11 and @xmath12 have a deeper theoretical meaning . in a basis where @xmath11 is diagonal , the zeros of @xmath12 propagate as zero minors in @xmath9 .",
    ".experimentally allowed classes of two zero minors , here @xmath13 denotes the zero minor corresponding to the @xmath14 element of @xmath9 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , there are fifteen possible two vanishing minors in @xmath9 . out of these fifteen only seven patterns [ table - i ] viz .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath19 can accommodate the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "of all the allowed two zero minors in the neutrino mass matrix only three cases @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath19 provide non - trivial zero minors , all other cases reduce to two zero textures when confronted with the neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we work in a basis where @xmath11 is diagonal ( @xmath20 ) , and the neutrino mixing arises solely from @xmath12 . in this basis , a zero entry in @xmath12 propagates as a vanishing minor in the effective neutrino mass matrix @xmath9 . here , we focus on @xmath0 and @xmath1 class of vanishing minors . to obtain the classes @xmath0 and @xmath1 of neutrino mass matrices ,",
    "we extend the standard model ( sm ) by adding three right - handed neutrino singlets @xmath21 and one scalar singlet @xmath22 . in order to enable the seesaw mechanism for suppressing the neutrino masses",
    "@xmath12 must have the following structures for @xmath0 and @xmath1 :    @xmath23    leading to the following effective neutrino mass matrices through the seesaw mechanism    @xmath24    a general procedure for enforcing zero textures in arbitrary entries of the fermion mass matrices using abelian family symmetries has been outlined in @xcite .",
    "the symmetry realization of all the allowed one zero and two zero textures was recently presented in @xcite . for the symmetry realization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 textures of two zero minors we consider a small cyclic group @xmath25 which corresponds to the minimal group since @xmath26 leads to a non - diagonal charged lepton and dirac neutrino mass matrix . under @xmath25",
    "the sm higgs doublet remains invariant and the leptonic fields are assumed to transform as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 = @xmath29 .",
    "hence the bilinears @xmath30 and @xmath31 , relevant for @xmath32 and @xmath11 transform as    @xmath33    the sm higgs doublet remains invariant under @xmath25 leading to diagonal @xmath32 and @xmath11 .",
    "the bilinear @xmath34 relevant for @xmath12 transforms as    @xmath35    we assume a scalar singlet @xmath22 transforming as @xmath36 for class @xmath0 and @xmath37 for class @xmath1 which leads to the following @xmath25 invariant yukawa lagrangians for classes @xmath0 and @xmath1 :    @xmath38    @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "next , we show how a large effective neutrino mass can arise in such a model .",
    "we note that @xmath12 contains two types of mass terms viz .",
    "1 ) bare mass term which does not need a scalar singlet and is invariant by itself .",
    "2 ) terms arising from yukawa couplings to @xmath22 .",
    "the scale of latter is restricted by the scale of @xmath25 breaking while there is no such restriction on the bare mass term which can have a higher mass scale .",
    "it can be seen from eqn.(3 ) that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 entries of @xmath9 have contributions to their numerators from @xmath41 and @xmath42 entries of @xmath12 which arise from the bare mass term .",
    "we assume the mass eigenvalues of @xmath11 to have same order of magnitude which leads to a large value of @xmath41 and @xmath42 entries of @xmath9 while the other elements of @xmath9 are suppressed , thus , leading to a large value of @xmath7 .",
    "since these textures are realized at the seesaw scale , the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the parameters of @xmath9 from the seesaw scale to the electroweak scale needs to be taken into account .",
    "it is well known that the rg effects are most prominent for the quasidegenerate mass spectrum which is precisely the case here due to the assumption of large @xmath7 .",
    "however , it is also known that zero minors in @xmath9 , at a given energy scale , remain zero at any other energy scale at the one loop level @xcite .",
    "this is because the matrices at any two energy scales @xmath43 and @xmath44 are related by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is diagonal , positive and non singular .",
    "the operation of diagonal matrices from left and right on @xmath9 does not alter the zero minors of @xmath9 leading to zero minors in @xmath9 at any other scale .",
    "we reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis assuming neutrinos to be majorana particles . in this basis",
    ", a complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 = diag@xmath50 .",
    "the matrix @xmath51 can be parameterized in terms of three neutrino masses ( @xmath52 ) , three neutrino mixing angles ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) and the dirac - type cp- violating phase @xmath56 .",
    "the two additional phases @xmath57 and @xmath58 appear if neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the matrix @xmath59 where @xcite @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 and    @xmath63    is the diagonal phase matrix with the two majorana - type cp- violating phases @xmath57 , @xmath58 and dirac - type cp - violating phase @xmath56 .",
    "the matrix @xmath47 is called the neutrino mixing matrix or the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite .",
    "( 9 ) and eq .",
    "( 10 ) , the neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath64 the cp violation in neutrino oscillation experiments can be described through a rephasing invariant quantity , @xmath65 @xcite with @xmath66 . in the above parametrization , @xmath65 is given by @xmath67 the simultaneous existence of two vanishing minors in the neutrino mass matrix implies @xmath68 these two conditions yield two complex equations viz .",
    "@xmath69 the above equations can be rewritten as @xmath70 where @xmath71 with @xmath72 as the cyclic permutation of ( 1,2,3 ) .",
    "these two complex eqns.(18 ) and ( 19 ) involve nine physical parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and three cp - violating phases @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the masses @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be calculated from the mass - squared differences @xmath79 and @xmath80 using the relations @xmath81 where @xmath82 for inverted spectrum ( is ) and @xmath83 for normal spectrum ( ns ) .",
    "using the experimental inputs of the two mass - squared differences and the three mixing angles we can constrain the other parameters .",
    "thus , in the two complex eqns.(18 ) and ( 19 ) we are left with four unknown parameters @xmath84 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath56 which are , obviously , correlated . simultaneously solving eqns.(18 ) and ( 19 ) for the two mass ratios , we obtain    @xmath85    and    @xmath86    the mass ratios for class @xmath0 to first order in @xmath87 are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 the mass ratios for class @xmath1 to first order in @xmath87 are @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the case of zero textures there exists a permutation symmetry between different patterns @xcite .",
    "similarly , there exists a permutation symmetry between patterns @xmath0 and @xmath1 of two zero minors which corresponds to the permutation in the 2 - 3 rows and 2 - 3 columns of @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding permutation matrix is given by    @xmath92    the right - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath12 for class @xmath1 can be obtained from @xmath12 for class @xmath0 by the transformation @xmath93 which after the seesaw gives @xmath94 this leads to the following relations between the parameters : @xmath95 the magnitude of the two mass ratios in eqns.(22 , 23 ) , is given by @xmath96 @xmath97 while the cp- violating majorana phases @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given by    @xmath98    @xmath99    since , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are known experimentally , the values of mass ratios @xmath100 from eqns.(32 ) and ( 33 ) can be used to calculate @xmath84 . this can be done by inverting eqns.(21 ) to obtain the two values of @xmath84 viz .",
    "@xmath101 numerical analysis ------------------    the experimental constraints on neutrino parameters at 1 , 2 and 3@xmath102 @xcite are given below : @xmath103 the observation of neutrinoless double beta ( ndb ) decay would signal lepton number violation and imply majorana nature of neutrinos , for recent reviews see @xcite .",
    "the effective majorana mass of the electron neutrino @xmath7 which determines the rate of ndb decay is given by @xmath104 part of the heidelberg - moscow collaboration claimed a signal in ndb decay corresponding to @xmath105 at 95@xmath106 c. l. @xcite .",
    "this claim was subsequently criticized in @xcite .",
    "the results reported in @xcite will be checked in the currently running and forthcoming ndb experiments .",
    "there are large number of projects such as cuoricino@xcite , cuore @xcite , gerda @xcite , majorana @xcite , supernemo @xcite , exo @xcite , genius @xcite which aim to achieve a sensitivity upto 0.01ev for @xmath7 . in the present work ,",
    "we take the upper limit of @xmath7 to be 0.5 @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "we vary the oscillation parameters within their known experimental ranges . however , the dirac - type cp - violating phase @xmath56 is varied within its full range .",
    "the two values of @xmath84 obtained from the mass ratios @xmath108 and @xmath102 , respectively must be equal to within the errors of the oscillation parameters for the simultaneous existence of two vanishing vanishing minors in @xmath9 .",
    "the first step in the numerical analysis uses the information of the two known mass squared differences along with the constraint of two zero minors and large @xmath7 to get predictions for the mixing angles .",
    "it is found that both the classes @xmath0 and @xmath1 predict a near maximal atmospheric mixing angle while the other two mixing angles remain unconstrained . the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath8 moves towards @xmath109 with increasing @xmath7 as seen in fig.(1 ) for class @xmath0 and fig.(2 ) for class @xmath1 .",
    "thus classes @xmath0 and @xmath1 of two vanishing minors in @xmath9 naturally predict a near maximal atmospheric mixing angle .",
    "the second step takes into account the experimental input on the three mixing angles including the recent t2k results on the reactor mixing angle .",
    "the results for @xmath8 are plotted in fig.(3 ) for class @xmath0 and fig.(4 ) for class @xmath1 . due to the relatively large value of @xmath55 , the dirac - type cp violating phase is almost fixed near @xmath110 or @xmath111 predicting almost maximal cp violation for these textures .",
    "fig.(5 ) and fig.(6 ) show the correlation between the two majorana - type phases and @xmath7 : the phases @xmath57 and @xmath58 approach zero with increasing @xmath7 . as an example , we write the numerically estimated mass matrices for the pattern @xmath0 , the matrices are obtained for the best fit values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 given in eqn.(37 ) .",
    "for ns we have @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and for is we have @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    the numerical matrices for pattern @xmath1 can be obtained from above matrices with the operation of 2 - 3 permutation symmetry .",
    "the assumption of large @xmath7 is testable in the ongoing and forthcoming experiments @xcite for ndb decay which will either confirm or rule out large @xmath7 in the next few years .",
    "the recent results of the t2k experiment suggest a relatively large reactor mixing angle .",
    "therefore , it is important to look for models naturally accommodating a non - zero value of reactor mixing angle while keeping the atmospheric mixing angle near maximal . in the present work , we studied the implications of class @xmath0 and @xmath1 of two zero minors in @xmath9 for large effective neutrino mass . in the context of type - i",
    "seesaw mechanism , taking @xmath32 and @xmath11 to be diagonal , the zeros of @xmath12 propagate as zero minors of @xmath9 and the origin of neutrino mixing is solely from @xmath12 .",
    "we presented the symmetry realization of these patterns using a cyclic group @xmath25 .",
    "it was found that class @xmath0 and @xmath1 predict a near maximal atmospheric mixing angle in the limit of large @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , this prediction is independent of the values of the reactor and the solar mixing angles .",
    "the assumption of large @xmath7 is testable in the ongoing experiments for ndb decay since the rate of ndb decay is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "these experiments will either confirm or rule out a large value of @xmath7 in the next few years .",
    "the atmospheric mixing angle approaches @xmath109 with the increasing value of @xmath7 .",
    "a reactor mixing angle equal to zero is not allowed in these textures , thus , naturally accommodating a non - zero @xmath6 as suggested by the recent results of the t2k experiment . due to the relatively large value of @xmath6",
    "the dirac - type cp violating phase is fixed near @xmath110 or @xmath111 predicting almost maximal cp violation for these textures .",
