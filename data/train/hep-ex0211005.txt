    "in the last years a renewed interest has arisen on the measurement of hadronic cross section at low energy ( @xmath1 ) , mostly because of the precision reached to test the standard model at lep and slc  @xcite and of the new experimental result of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath2 at brookhaven  @xcite .",
    "the experimental accuracy reached so far asks for a precise determination of the theoretical estimate of both @xmath3 and @xmath2 , whose main error comes from the non - perturbative computation of low energy hadronic contributions to the vacuum polarization , which can be computed using @xmath4 data at low energy .",
    "the amazing precision ( of @xmath5 ) reached on @xmath2 at bnl has required a careful re - evaluation of the theoretical estimate : as an example , a large part of the 2.6 @xmath6 deviation between the measurement of @xmath2 published last year  @xcite and the standard model prediction was caused by a wrong sign in the calculation of light - by - light scattering contributions  @xcite .",
    "after this sign correction , however , the situation for @xmath7 is still unclear : using only @xmath4 data a @xmath8 discrepancy between the bnl measured value an the theoretical prediction is still present  @xcite , which becomes 1.6 @xmath6 if hadronic decays of @xmath9 are also used  @xcite .",
    "hadronic @xmath4 annihilation cross sections have been measured by many laboratories in the last 20 years  @xcite .",
    "usually the cross section for individual channel is measured for energies below 2 gev , while above that , the hadronic final states are treated inclusively .",
    "[ fig1](_right _ ) shows an up - date compilation of these data done by burkhardt and pietrzyk  @xcite .",
    "the main improvements come in the region below 5 gev , in particular between @xmath10 where the besii coll .",
    "has reduced the error to @xmath11  @xcite ( before was @xmath12 ) , and in the region below 1 gev , where the cmd-2 coll .",
    "has measured the pion form factor with a systematical error of @xmath13 in the energy range from 0.61 to 0.96 gev  @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig1](_left _ ) ) .",
    "both these new results have a significant impact on the updated calculation of @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite , and will be discussed below . while the data between 2 - 5 gev are now closer to perturbative qcd , the error in the 1 - 2 gev region is still 15% : a reduction of this error to few _ percent _ will be very important both for @xmath3 and @xmath2 calculations .",
