    "measurements of cross sections for quasi - elastic electron scattering provide basic tests of our understanding of nuclei .",
    "experiments have been performed at the mit bates laboratory  @xcite , at the saclay laboratory  @xcite and at slac  @xcite in order to explore this reaction .",
    "a recent review of quasi - elastic scattering provides a guide to the experimental and theoretical results  @xcite .",
    "generally it is assumed that the reaction is dominated by the exchange of one hard photon between the electron and a nucleon in the nucleus .",
    "many soft photons also are exchanged and their effects are described by distorted waves based on the coulomb potential in the initial and final states of the electron . an important issue is to account for the effects of the coulomb interaction in a manner that allows extraction of the nuclear response functions , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which correspond to plane - wave matrix elements of the longitudinal and transverse parts of the currents .",
    "after the nucleon form factor is divided out , the longitudinal response function at a fixed and sufficiently large value of the momentum transfer , q , is expected to satisfy a coulomb sum rule , i.e. , @xmath5 , where z is the number of protons .",
    "such a sum rule should hold under general conditions for a nonrelativistic description of nuclear wave functions and currents provided only that @xmath2 is sufficiently large to make the effects of correlations small .",
    "although the response functions are affected by the final - state interactions ( fsi ) , the sum rule should not be affected by them because it relies on a sum over a complete set of final states of the nucleus .",
    "when relativistic effects in the nuclear current are taken into account , there are minor relativistic corrections to the sum rule but it remains useful .",
    "however , attempts to verify it experimentally have produced puzzling results and controversy about coulomb corrections .    in order to obtain the longitudinal response function ,",
    "it is conventional to perform a rosenbluth separation after dividing the cross section by the mott cross section @xmath6 and some kinematical factors , @xmath7 with @xmath8 and where @xmath9 .",
    "the longitudinal virtual - photon polarization is defined as @xmath10 at fixed @xmath2 and @xmath11 , it varies from 0 to 1 as the electron scattering angle @xmath12 varies from 180 to 0 degrees .",
    "measurements of the cross section at different values of @xmath13 for fixed values of @xmath2 and @xmath11 allow a separation of the experimental response functions , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath14 that is extracted from experimental cross section as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rlexpt&rtexpt ] ) can differ from the desired @xmath3 , which is the plane - wave matrix element of the longitudinal current , for two reasons .",
    "one is that coulomb corrections associated with spin - dependent effects in the electron wave functions can cause the contributions of the longitudinal and transverse currents to have different dependence on @xmath12 than is assumed in the rosenbluth separation .",
    "@xcite the other is that coulomb distorted waves alter the response .",
    "these coulomb corrections should be removed before the coulomb sum rule can be evaluated .",
    "in addition , nucleon form factors should be divided out of the longitudinal response function . a standard approach to modeling the coulomb corrections",
    "is to use the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "one solves the dirac equation for the electron distorted waves in the presence of the coulomb potential for both the initial and final states of the electron .",
    "@xcite when these distorted waves are combined with nuclear wave functions obtained from a model of nuclear structure , and appropriate current operators , cross sections may be calculated and compared with experimental results .",
    "the dwba analysis involves extensive numerical calculations .",
    "owing to the infinite range of the coulomb potential , partial - wave expansions converge very slowly , the more so as the energy increases .",
    "a number of works have used the eikonal approximation in order to simplify the analysis at high energies .",
    "the use of the eikonal approximation also must be accompanied by inclusion of `` focusing factors '' that are not present in the eikonal wave functions .",
    "@xcite czyz and gottfried  @xcite used the eikonal approximation to analyze electron scattering but that work did not include focusing factors .",
    "an analysis based on the schrodinger equation showed that the corrections to the eikonal approximation generally produce a focusing factor in the wave function .",
    "@xcite work by giusti _",
    "_ also is based on the eikonal approximation  @xcite and some recents works have combined the eikonal approximation with semi - classical focusing factors in order to assess coulomb corrections in quasi - elastic scattering .",
    "@xcite    a very simple effective - momentum approximation ( ema ) for treating the coulomb corrections was developed by rosenfelder@xcite and triani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in the ema",
    "the effects of the coulomb potential are incorporated as shifts of the initial and final electron momentum values that should be used in a plane - wave born approximation ( pwia ) analysis .",
    "the shifted electron momenta are the effective momenta .",
    "they imply a corresponding shift of the photon momentum , @xmath16 .",
    "interpretations of quasi - elastic data depend upon many experimental details and different experiments have produced significantly different values of the coulomb sum rule .",
    "@xcite in addition to possible experimental differences , there are theoretical differences in the analysis of the coulomb corrections because the dwba analysis based on partial waves has been used for some experiments and the ema analysis has been used for others . sometimes it is assumed that the nucleon form factors can be pulled out of the matrix element and evaluated at the momentum transfer of the electron .",
    "@xcite at other times the form factors are evaluated at the effective photon momentum , @xmath17 .    in order to address questions about the theoretical differences in the treatment of coulomb distorted waves",
    ", we developed a systematic eikonal expansion in ref .",
    "that provides more accurate eikonal wave functions for a dwba analysis .",
    "the accuracy is good enough to eliminate concerns about use of the eikonal approximation at the energies of interest .",
    "moreover the `` focusing factors '' arise naturally as part of the corrections to the eikonal approximation and the ad - hoc procedure of incorporating them is replaced by a systematic procedure .",
    "the eikonal expansion was found to converge rapidly at electron energies of interest .",
    "it has the advantage of providing insight into the nature of the coulomb corrections because the focusing factors , the eikonal phase shifts that determine the momentum shifts and spin - dependent effects can be isolated for study .    in order to assess the accuracy of the ema using the eikonal wave functions",

    "that assumption can be checked because the pwia response is known in the model .",
    "a factor @xmath23 can be used to relate @xmath20 to the coulomb potential at @xmath24 , as follows , @xmath25 the factor @xmath23 is approximately the same for different nuclei .",
    "we found momentum shifts in fig .",
    "7 of ref .",
    "that correspond to @xmath26 near the peak of the response function for 500 mev @xmath27 scatttering .",
    "larger values of @xmath23 up to about 1 were found at the smallest and largest @xmath11 values but the response is small at those points . although fits of the dwba results can be made more precise by allowing @xmath20 to depend on the energy loss , @xmath11 , in this work we use a constant shift @xmath20 . that yields reasonable results and is simpler and thus preferable for the analysis of experimental data .    if the momentum - shift @xmath20 and normalization constant @xmath22 are determined theoretically for a given nucleus such that the dwba response is well described by the ema fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : emafit ] ) , then one may equate @xmath28 at fixed electron beam energy , @xmath29 , and fixed momentum transfer @xmath30 to a constant @xmath22 times the pwia response function evaluated at the effective momentum transfer .",
    "that would remove the coulomb effects to a reasonable approximation and allow the pwia response to be extracted from experimental data .",
    "we expect similar coulomb corrections for a variety of nuclear models .",
    "@xcite the goal is to remove them with minimal reliance on any nuclear model .",
    "however , it must first be determined how well @xmath3 can be extracted from experimental data .",
    "the spin - dependence of the eikonal wave functions was omitted in our previous paper , which left unanswered the question of the accuracy with which the desired response functions might be extracted from experimental cross sections .",
    "that is the first issue addressed in this paper . in sec .",
    "ii we restate the essential results of the eikonal expansion for dirac wave functions and focus on the spin - dependent eikonal corrections .",
    "these are shown to provide very small differences to quasi - elastic cross sections , i.e. , the helicity matrix elements of the electron current are very close to those based on the pwia .",
    "the consequence is that when both initial and final electron energies are 200 mev or more , the usual rosenbluth separation provides an accurate separation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , well within the limits of experimental accuracy .",
    "although the rosenbluth separation should be accurate , there remain significant coulomb effects within @xmath3 .",
    "they can be treated with reasonable accuracy by use of the effective momentum approximation .    in order to determine more realistic values of the momentum shift , @xmath20 ,",
    "shell model wave functions are used to describe the nucleus in this work .",
    "our calculations are simplified by use of an approximation that is introduced by us in ref .",
    "@xcite and described in section iii , and which is denoted emar .",
    "that approximation applies the effective momentum approximation to the hard - photon propagator and form factors in order to reduce the numerical evaluation to a three - dimensional integration that provides a careful treatment of the full @xmath31-dependence of the coulombic effects from the electron wave functions . in the emar analysis ,",
    "the nuclear current is handled in terms of a hadronic tensor , which can be extended to include the neutron contributions to cross sections .",

    "section iv presents numerical calculations for quasi - elastic scattering by @xmath0 and @xmath1 using kinematics that are relevant to a recent experiment at jefferson laboratory .",
    "the nuclear model used is simple and a number of significant effects are omitted from the calculations , such as final - state interactions  @xcite , correlations ,  @xcite and pion and @xmath32 production  @xcite , but the calculated cross sections are expected to be roughly similar to experimental ones .",

    "( [ eq : emafit ] ) to experimental data so as to determine @xmath33 .",
    "conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "because electron energies of interest generally are much greater than the electron mass , and the coulomb potential and photon exchange are vector interactions , electron helicity is conserved to a very high degree of accuracy in quasi - elastic scattering .",

    "for a 500 mev electron scattering from the coulomb potential of a @xmath0 nucleus , the phase @xmath92 typically has magnitude of 0.03 or less as shown in fig .  [ fig : gamma&delta ] .",

    "the net effect is to reduce substantially the contributions from terms that involve the azimuthal angles @xmath104 .",
    "our numerical results show that cross sections calculated with the spin - dependent coulomb corrections included are closer than one part per thousand to ones calculated using the pwia helicity matrix elements .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure  [ fig : rl_emar&ema ] , which shows the ratio of longitudinal response functions ( calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rl_emar ] ) ) with and without the spin - dependent coulomb corrections at 500 mev electron energy . only for large energy loss , where the final state electron energy becomes small , does the ratio differ from unity by more that a few parts in ten thousand . for reference ,",
    "the dotted line shows the variation of @xmath105 .",
    "note that for energy loss @xmath11 = 300 mev , the final electron energy is 200 mev , but the ratio of cross sections with and without the coulomb spin corrections differs from unity by less that one part per thousand . as the energy loss increases , the coulomb spin corrections become relatively more important but the response function is decreasing to zero .",
    "the net effect is that the absolute error in the response function is about one part in ten thousand of the maximum value of @xmath3 .",
    "this is important because the helicity matrix elements govern the dependence of the cross sections on the electron scattering angle , @xmath12 , at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "when the pwia helicity matrix elements provide an accurate approximation , the angle dependence is the same as in pwia cross sections , and the rosenbluth separation can be used to extract the longitudinal and transverse current matrix elements .",

    "for those shells , the distortion effects in the electron waves contribute at radii away from @xmath24 where the coulomb potential is weaker .",
    "the results for the 1s shell show that both emar and dwba yield the same value of @xmath164k .",
    "the momentum shifts should be equal also for response functions based on the sum over all shells .",
    "figures  [ fig : rl.run1.pb.05.16.08 ] and [ fig : rt.run1.pb.05.16.08 ] show the longitudinal and transverse response functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 that do not have form factors divided out for pb at q=550",
    "results are shown for the pwia , ema and emar calculations , where the ema results are not a fit but rather are a straightforward calculation using @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "the coulomb effects of the emar analysis are well approximated by the ema calculation . as has been discussed ,",
    "the overall magnitude of the ema response is higher than the emar response by about 2% because the @xmath22 parameter has not been used .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma.run1.fe ] shows cross sections for @xmath1 at 500 mev electron energy and q= 550 mev / c and figure  [ fig : sigma.run2.fe ] shows cross sections at 800 mev electron energy and q = 900 mev / c .",
    "coulomb effects are somewhat smaller for the @xmath1 nucleus because the coulomb potential is smaller .",
    "response functions for the @xmath1 target are shown in figure  [ fig : rl.run1.run2.fe ] .",
    "fits of the response functions to the ema form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : emafit ] ) yield the fitting parameters shown in table  [ table : emafits ] .",
    "the shifts are given in this case by @xmath170 0.71 ( 500 mev ) and 0.77 ( 800 mev ) .",
    "in this work we have tested some assumptions that have been used in the analysis of experimental data for quasielastic scattering from nuclei .",
    "the main focus is to use a known nuclear model ( in this case the shell model ) in order to test how well the coulomb corrections can be removed from dwba cross sections using the effective - momentum approximation ( ema ) .",
    "the goal is to extract pwia response functions from the dwba cross sections .",
    "it is assumed that the coulomb corrections are not much affected by the nuclear model used .    at the electron beam energies considered in the work , namely 500 mev and higher , the coulomb effects in quasielastic scattering from nuclei can be described accurately using the eikonal distorted waves that include higher - order corrections .",
    "the eikonal analysis has simplifying features because one can isolate the phases that cause shifts of the electron momenta , the focusing factors and the spin phases that affect the l / t separation .",
    "we have used the analytical phases up to order @xmath171 in the eikonal expansion that were developed in ref .  .",
    "as one check on the numerics , the eikonal phases were computed two ways : by direct numerical integration of the defining equations and by use of the analytical formulas . both give the same results .",
    "for the cases considered in this work , the eikonal wave functions provide very well converged results . as a check of the three - dimensional integration used in the emar analysis ,",
    "the pwia results were computed two ways : using analytical fourier transforms of the nucleon s bound state wave functions and by three - dimensional numerical integration .",
    "the latter calculations are the same as those for the emar amplitude except that the coulomb effects are omitted . with suitable integration grids",
    "the results are essentially the same at an accuracy better than 1% near the peak of response functions and errors at larger @xmath11 can be 1% or 2% of the peak value of the response function .",
    "generally the errors in numerical results are insignificant in the plots .",
    "full dwba computations are extremely time consuming .",
    "an approximation called emar is used to simplify the analysis .",
    "the emar analysis evaluates the full r - dependence of the eikonal distorted waves but approximates the hard - photon propagator and the form factor in the nucleon current by evaluating them at the effective momentum , @xmath17 .",
    "tests of the emar against the full dwba analysis were carried out for the response function of the 1s shell of @xmath172pb .",
    "those tests showed that the emar produces close agreement with the dwba .",
    "moreover , the assumption that one should remove the nucleon form factor ( which is integrated over in the dwba analysis ) by evaluating it at @xmath17 was found to be justified with better than 1% accuracy .",
    "this should be compared with large differences in cross sections when the form factor is evaluated at @xmath2 , the momentum transfer of the electron , instead of @xmath17 .",
    "we find clear evidence that the form factor should be evaluated at the effective momentum when it is divided out of experimental cross sections in order to check the coulomb sum rule .    the analysis of bates experimental data in ref .",
    "@xcite uses the form factor at @xmath2 rather @xmath17 for a @xmath173 nucleus .",
    "results for the coulomb sum rule are about 0.8 - 0.9 compared with the expectation of unity . if @xmath17 were used in the analysis , the bates results for the coulomb sum rule would be increased by about 5% , thus making them closer to unity .",
    "the analysis of saclay experimental data in refs .",
    "@xcite uses form factors at @xmath17 .",
    "significantly lower values for the coulomb sum rule are found based on the saclay analysis .",
    "the differences between the bates and saclay results are much larger than can be attributed to coulomb corrections .",
    "we find that the spin phases in electron wave functions produce very small effects at energies of 500 mev or higher .",
    "the helicity matrix elements that involve the spin phases are very close to those of a pwia analysis for quasi - elastic scattering .",
    "consequently , the rosenbluth separation extracts response functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 that are accurate in the sense that they correspond very closely to the distorted wave matrix elements of the longitudinal and transverse parts of the currents .",
    "the effects of the distorted waves on the longitudinal response function are twofold : 1 . ) for electron scattering they shift the peak of the response functions towards larger values of the energy loss , @xmath11 , and 2 . )",
    "they distort the shapes of the response functions , more so for the inner shells than the outer ones .",
    "however , reasonably accurate fits of the distorted response functions can be obtained using the ema fitting procedure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : emafit ] ) .",
    "the momentum shift parameter @xmath20 is found to be given by @xmath174 , for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 nuclei , i.e. , @xmath175 , where @xmath73 is the coulomb potential .",
    "more precise values are given in table  [ table : emafits ] .",
    "the normalization parameter @xmath22 is equal to 1.00 within one or two percent .",
    "the uncertainty arises because the normalization for the sum over shells has been calculated based on the full dwba for the 1s - shell of @xmath0 and because the shape of the distorted response function differs a little from the shape of the pwia response function for @xmath11 significantly away from the peak",
    ". therefore fits to the pwia shape can not reproduce the response precisely .",
    "note that the good agreement of @xmath23 and @xmath22 for @xmath172pb and @xmath176fe demonstrates that the coulomb corrections do not depend significantly on the nuclear model .",
    "note also that the analysis of experimental data using a fit as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : emafit ] ) tends to give more accurate results for @xmath177 at the peak of the response because that is controlled by @xmath20 and less accurate results away from the peak because of the distortion of the shape .",
    "estimates of longitudinal , transverse and total cross sections have been calculated using shell model wave functions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath2 = 0.55 gev / c and @xmath2 = 0.8 gev / c .",
    "these kinematical conditions match the ones used in a recent experiment at jlab .",
    "because final - state interactions , correlations and pion production have been omitted , the calculated cross sections may differ significantly from experimental cross sections .",
    "nevertheless the coulomb corrections should be reliable at the level of a few percent .",
    "coulomb corrections are notoriously difficult to calculate and our calculations refute claims that may be found in the literature .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite claims that the ema procedure is not accurate for the longitudinal response at 485 electron energy and @xmath178 scattering angle for a @xmath0 target .",
    "the basis for the claim is that significant differences are found between ema results and results based on an ad - hoc dwba analysis that has been used extensively .",
    "we find that the ema with appropriate parameters can describe the 1s - shell dwba or all - shells emar results very well at essentially the same kinematics .",
    "we wish to emphasize that all of our numerics are under good control and various consistency checks have been made that give confidence in the results reported herein .",
