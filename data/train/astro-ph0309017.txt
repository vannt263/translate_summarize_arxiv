    "five millisecond pulsars have been recently discovered in ngc 6752 displaying unexpected characteristics ( damico et al .",
    "psr - a , a canonical recycled binary pulsar , holds the record of being the farthest millisecond pulsar ever observed from the gravitational center of a globular cluster , at a distance of @xmath5 3.3 half mass radii .",
    "psr - c , an isolated pulsar , ranks second in the list of the most offset pulsars , being at a distance of 1.4 half mass radii from the center for each of the two offset sources . ] .",
    "psr - b , psr - e , and psr - d are located instead within the cluster core and are single ; psr - b and psr - e have remarkably high _ negative _ spin derivatives while psr - d has a _ positive _ @xmath6 , one of the highest measured among the globular cluster pulsars .",
    "if the negative spin derivatives of psr - b and psr - e are ascribed to the overall effect of the cluster gravitational potential , this would result in a central projected mass to light ratio @xmath7 ( ferraro et al .",
    "this high ratio may imply the presence of @xmath8 of under - luminous matter enclosed within the central 0.08 pc of the cluster ( ferraro et al .",
    "2003a ) , perhaps in the form of a single intermediate - mass black hole and/or in the form of collapsed stellar remnants .",
    "in this scenario even the very high positive @xmath9 of psr - d could be explained as due to the line - of - sight gravitational pull of this unseen matter .",
    "however , as pulsars spin down due to rotational energy losses , the period derivative of psr - d could also be intrinsic .",
    "alternatively , one could argue that the negative values of @xmath9 of psr - b and psr - e would result from the gravitational pull of some _ local perturber _ , such as a nearby passing star or even a more massive exotic objects ( ferraro et al .",
    "the millisecond pulsars in ngc 6752 are peculiar in their location or acceleration , and the combination of these facts strongly suggests the occurrence of an _ uncommon dynamics _ in the core and halo of ngc 6752 .",
    "it is our aim to address this issue here in detail .    in a previous paper ( colpi , possenti , & gualandris 2002 ,",
    "cpg hereafter ) we explored a number of roots for the origin of psr - a : psr - a may have originated from a primordial binary , born either in the halo or in the core ; but a careful analysis ( based on considerations on characteristic lifetimes and neutron star natal kicks ) led us to discard both these two hypotheses ( see cpg ) .",
    "a third , involving a 3-body scattering or exchange event off core stars , was also rejected given the tight constraints imposed by the binary nature of psr - a ( cpg ) .",
    "we thus were led to conjecture that a more massive target , such as _ a binary of two black holes _ with masses in the range @xmath10 could have provided , in a 4-body scattering event , the necessary thrust to propel psr - a into its current halo orbit , at an acceptable event rate ( cpg ) .",
    "psr - a may just signal the presence of a black hole binary in ngc 6752 , but this is somewhat puzzling .",
    "black hole binaries are expected to form in rich star clusters ; but along the course of evolution they are expected to exit their parent cluster ( kulkarni , hut , & mcmillan 1993 ; sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ) . the black holes ( relics of the most massive stars ) tend to pair with other black holes in binaries as soon as they segregate in the cluster core by dynamical friction ( kulkarni , hut , & mcmillan 1993 ) .",
    "some binary may rapidly merge emitting gravitational waves ( benacquista 1999 ; miller 2002 ) creating a more massive black hole ( miller & hamilton 2002 ) , but most / many leave the cluster since close ( 3- or 4-body ) dynamical encounters among the black holes eject them , single or in binaries , due to recoil ( sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ; kulkarni , hut , & mcmillan 1993 ) .",
    "current n - body simulations ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) expect no black hole or one black hole binary to remain in the cluster . thus ,",
    "if the interpretation of psr - a is correct , we may provide first dynamical evidence of the `` only '' black hole binary that avoided the escape .",
    "a goal of this paper is to further explore this possibility narrowing the range of masses of the two black holes from pulsar dynamics .",
    "there is an alternative root for the origin of the unusual location of psr - a that we wish to explore here in connection to the high @xmath11 ratio , and so to the potential presence of under - luminous matter in the cluster core : the ejection of psr - a into the halo of ngc 6752 by a dynamical encounter with _ a central intermediate - mass black hole_. according to an old suggestion by frank & rees ( 1976 ) stars in the _ cusp _ of a massive black hole can eject other stars plunging inside ( lin & tremaine 1980 ) .",
    "a flyby involving a central black hole , a bound star orbiting around it , and the binary pulsar , may imprint to psr - a the right recoil speed to climb the potential well of the cluster and reach the halo .",
    "single black holes of intermediate mass ( @xmath12 ) may inhabit the center of globular clusters ; their formation root can involve the runaway growth of a super - massive star through collisions of heavy stars in the young cluster ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) or the occurrence of repeated mergers among compact objects ( miller & hamilton 2002 ; see van der marel 2003 and miller 2003 for a review ) .",
    "recently , hst / stis observations of the globular cluster g1 in m31 ( gebhardt et al . 2002 ) and of m15 in the milky way ( gerssen et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) have provided first clues for the presence of a single central black hole .",
    "surprisingly , the two postulated black holes , of mass @xmath13 in g1 , and of @xmath14 in m15 , seem to lie just along the extrapolation of the black hole mass versus 1d dispersion velocity relation ( @xmath15 ) obeyed by the super - massive black holes in galaxy spheroids ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "here we assume that the hypothetical black hole in ngc 6752 just lies on the @xmath16 relation .",
    "( note that current evidence of a large black hole in g1 and m15 is not yet compelling : baumgardt et al .",

    "we examine the statistics of the encounters , while in @xmath22 we shortly explore exotic end - states . in @xmath23 , we model the random walk ( moderated by dynamical friction ) of the black hole binary induced by stellar collisions , and try to evaluate the local gravitational pull that a black hole binary may exert on the core pulsars , inside ngc 6752 . in @xmath24",

    "constraints on their values derive mainly from limits on their ejection due to gravitational encounters and survival against coalescence by emission of gravitational waves ( gws hereafter ) .    in general",

    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] for the ( @xmath2 ) binary , the distribution of the recoil velocity displays two humps , the first associated to fbs , and the second to ions .",
    "ions can thus imprint significant non - equilibrium velocities on the black hole binary .",
    "in the post - recycling scenario , fbs are statistically more frequent . in general , with increasing mass of the black hole binary and decreasing mass ratio @xmath152 the frequency of ions increases ; from 8%-12% if the target is a binary , up to @xmath153 in the case .",
    "triple systems have a high probability of formation , among ions , and they will be described in @xmath22 .",
    "qs account for @xmath154 of the end - states ; many of these systems are wide and loose so that the interaction with the gravitational potential of the cluster causes their fission into two separate binaries . in the pre - recycling case ,",

    "we list , in table  [ tbl-5 ] , the minimum density of recycled neutron stars @xmath159 necessary to have an encounter probability comparable to that of detecting at the current position .",

    "note that in the case of pre - recycling , @xmath167 can be much larger , since there are no constraints on the spin history of the neutron star .",
    "a black hole binary in a cluster is a catalyst for the formation of exotic triple systems composed of the two black holes and a star .",
    "this is a consequence of the high frequency of ionization events in binary - binary encounters ending with the capture of one of the two binary stars .",
    "table 2 and table 4 give in bracket the fraction of triple systems that form over the total .",
    "these comprise from @xmath168 up to @xmath169 of all events in binaries .",
    "the question is now whether the triplet that forms is long - term stable , or short - term stable , i.e. , destined to lose one of its components after a few outer - orbital times ( mardling & aarseth 2001 ) .    in our experiments",
    "we have focused attention to binary - binary encounters leading to the formation of triplets with an active pulsar ( in the post - recycling case ) orbiting around one of the two black holes .",
    "we then extract from the sample those triplets that fulfill the long - term stability criterion following mardling & aarseth ( 2001 ; their eq .",
    "the stable triplets are more frequently composed by the millisecond pulsar orbiting around the heavier black hole ( forming the inner binary ) with the lighter black hole ( the outer binary ) orbiting around the inner pair .",
    "the typical parameters of the inner binaries found in our simulations have orbital periods ranging between 10 to 100 days corresponding to orbital separations of 200 to 10,000 light seconds .",
    "the orbital acceleration imparted to the millisecond pulsar by the black hole would not hamper its detection by current deep globular cluster pulsar surveys ( possenti et al .",
    "2003 ; ransom 2003 ; jacoby 2003 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig7 ] shows the formation of a triplet for the ( @xmath170 ) binary .",
    "triplets with the millisecond pulsar and the light black hole as inner binary are long - term stable only if their orbit is very tight .",
    "the stronger acceleration suffered by the millisecond pulsar due to its proximity to the hole would induce very rapid changes in the apparent spin period along the orbital motion impliying a strong bias against the discovery of such pulsars@xmath171 .",
    "msp - black - hole binaries have long been searched in globular clusters as they can form via 3-body exchange interactions between single black holes and binary pulsars ( sigurdsson 2003 ) .",
    "we here for - see the possibility of detecting a hierarchical triple msp - black - hole - black - hole system that would provide a direct measure of the mass of the heaviest black hole .",
    "0.2truecm = 8.truecm = 8.truecm 0.2truecm    considering the case of a single intermediate - mass black hole in the cluster core , binary - binary encounters of the type studied here can lead to the `` capture '' of a millisecond pulsar thanks to the interaction of the binary pulsar with the start belonging to the cusp .",
    "this is a possibility that will be studied in more detail , introducing a model for the cusp .",
    "the single intermediate - mass black hole @xmath172 can account for a portion of the unseen matter required for explaining the spin derivatives of psr - b , psr - e ( and perhaps of psr - d ) .",
    "alternatively , one may wonder whether a suitably located perturber such as a black hole binary can accelerate the two pulsars .",
    "( this would reduce the demand of a significant amount of under - luminous matter in the core of ngc 6752 . )",
    "the perturber should imprint a line - of - sight acceleration @xmath173 considering the value of @xmath174 for the two pulsars ( psr - b and psr - e ) , and a separation @xmath175 pc ( damico et al .",
    "2002 ) , comparable to the projected distance between the two pulsars , we can infer the minimum mass that the binary should have to impart the observed acceleration ; @xmath176 .",
    "thus , the ( @xmath136 ) binary has the right total mass . assuming an harmonic potential for the central region of the cluster with uniform stellar mass density @xmath177 of @xmath178 ( where @xmath179 is the mean stellar mass ) , the minimum recoil velocity for moving the black hole binary from the center of the potential well to the pulsar projected locations ( at @xmath180 pc ) is v^2_,min^1/2~4 ( r0.08 pc ) ( m n10 ^ 5  pc^-3)^1/2 .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] and table  [ tbl-3 ] show that a binary of the required mass has typical @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) in the post- ( pre- ) recycling scenario , lower than the value required .",
    "however the black hole binary is subject to repeated close encounters with cluster stars before dynamical friction drives it toward the center of gravity of the cluster ( merritt 2002 ) .",
    "this depends on the comparison between the dynamical friction timescale @xmath183 $ ] and the collision time off stars @xmath184.$ ] their ratio ~5 ( a_max,7 au ) ( 10 ) ^2(0.5 m ) is above unity but uncomfortably close . because of this non - equilibrium dynamics , an intermediate - mass black hole binary of ( @xmath136 ) may random walk up to the current position of psr - b and psr - e .",
    "this scenario is possible but remains fine tuned .",
    "in this section we address the issue of the survival of our stellar and intermediate - mass black hole binaries against hardening by stellar collisions .",
    "the last black hole binary that remains in the cluster core ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) has a large cross section and interacts with the cluster stars .",
    "thus , we expect it to harden progressively ejecting stars and emitting gravitational waves ; at the same time stars may be tidally captured .",
    "0.2truecm = 8.truecm = 8.truecm 0.2truecm    it is the heaviest black hole in the binary that preferentially eats ( unbound ) stars because of its higher gravitational focusing .",
    "this leads to a secular change in the mass and orbital parameters .",
    "we mimicked evolution , solving the equations for the binary separation @xmath78 and mass @xmath26 as a function of time = -2_g a_^2_i m_i n_i _ i- 64 g^3 m_c^5 a^3(1-e^2)^7/2 ,    = 2 g ^4/3 _",

    "the capture rate on @xmath26 refers to a cross section equal to @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the tidal radius of the star considered .",
    "we assume that the entire star is eaten .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8 ] shows @xmath188 for two values of the stellar density @xmath158 ( treated as a constant in time ) .",
    "we found that a secular increase in the mass of the binary black hole becomes appreciable only if the initial mass @xmath189 under the background conditions imposed .",
    "a ( @xmath2 ) or ( @xmath190 ) binary avoid coalescence and its separation remains @xmath191 au for an appreciably long time .",
    "an `` intermediate - mass '' mass black hole binary ( such as that considered in @xmath23 with @xmath192 at the start ) should have already terminated its life or be on the verge of coalescing , ending in a single black hole , and , curiously , should have grown to a mass close to @xmath193 clearly , binary evolution is rather sensitive to the background density which is itself evolving with time ( a fact that we did not include in this simplified treatment ) .",
    "thus , the dynamical evolution of an intermediate - mass black hole binary should thus be addressed using a full n - body code .",
    "lighter `` stellar - mass '' black hole binaries are still in the hardening phase and the mass increase is not significant .",
    "if our binaries will coalesce by gw emission , they will remain always far from the critical regime ( corresponding to mass ratios @xmath51 around 0.385 ) at which the gravitational rocket effect comes into play ( fitchett & detweiler 1984 ) , and will avoid ejection from the cluster due to release of non - zero net linear momentum .",
    "since black hole hardening ( occurring at a rate @xmath194 ) is followed by stellar ejection , a correlation exists between the mass lost in stars m_deficit~m_t _ ( a_(0)a_(t ) ) and the total mass @xmath195 of the binary black hole ( treated as a constant ) . in equation",
    "( 11 ) , @xmath196 refers to the maximum semimajor axis at which the interactions are strong enough to eject stars .",
    "when @xmath197 @xmath198 is the mass that needs to be ejected in order to drive the binary toward coalescence by gws . if ngc 6752 still hosts a binary black hole , one may ask whether the `` deficit '' in stars created by their ejection from the cluster would alter appreciably the stellar density profile or velocity field in the central regions .",
    "if , similarly to what claimed in bright `` core - ellipticals '' , a binary black hole turns an otherwise power - law density profile into a core ( or shallower lower - low ) due to the ejection of stars ( see ferrarese et al .",
    "1994 ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ; milosavljevi , merritt , rest , van den bosch 2002 for details ) , then one can verify if the `` mass deficit '' ( defined as the mass in stars that would need to be removed from an initially power - law profile in order to produce the observed core ) correlates with the mass of the binary black hole according to equation ( 11 ) . de - projecting the power - law+core profile of ferraro et al .",
    "( 2003a ; figure 6 ) we infer for ngc 6752 a deficit of 300 `` missing '' stars .",
    "this is close to the mass that would be ejected by one of our binary black holes ( eq . [ 11 ] ) .",
    "since the central relaxation time is of the order of the ejection time , a flow of stars can refill an underlying power - law , but gravitational heating ( spitzer 1987 ) induced by star loss can counteract this process . only a detailed cluster model with a core binary black hole can address this question in detail , and should be designed specifically for ngc 6752 .",
    "what have we learned from this analysis ?",
    "\\(a ) a stellar - mass binary black hole of ( @xmath2 ) can imprint the right thrust to psr - a in a gentle flyby leaving almost unperturbed its eccentricity .",
    "fliesby off this binary can occur at an acceptable rate without imposing unrealistic conditions on the neutron star density inside the central 0.1 pc .",
    "this binary black hole long lives in the cluster . lighter black hole binaries or binaries with a black hole and a neutron star have interaction rates smaller by a factor @xmath86 and can be excluded ( see table 5 ) .",
    "\\(b ) an intermediate - mass binary black hole of ( @xmath136 ) is more aggressive on the binary pulsar , as it tends to impart large recoil speeds to any incoming particle .",
    "thus , it has to be sufficiently wide ( @xmath199 ) to propel ( or ) in the halo of ngc 6752 at the speed requested .",
    "such binary demands the lowest neutron star density to allow one ejection every billion years ( table 5 ) .",
    "the survival of such binary black hole in the cluster however is uncertain : the binary may have merged into a single black hole in its interaction with the background stars : its presence in the cluster implies either recent formation , or hardening on a time scale comparable to the age of the cluster .",
    "this binary may become the seed upon which our hypothetical `` single '' intermediate - mass black hole has grown .",
    "\\(c ) a single , intermediate - mass black hole of @xmath4 is a possibility . the recoil speed of psr - a falls in the correct interval and considering its weak dependence on @xmath55 ( recoil is more sensitive to the reduced mass of the system ) even a @xmath200 would fit in this picture .",
    "the gravitational encounter with psr - a must occur before recycling as the binary hosting the neutron star suffers a considerable change in its eccentricity .",
    "circularization can be achieved later , during the phase of roche lobe mass transfer : we find that the binary is left in an outgoing state such to favor `` scattering induced recycling '' .    the considerations in ( a , b ,",
    "c ) do not address the problem of the acceleration of psr - b and psr - e .",
    "can we provide a self - consistent picture ? if there is a stellar - mass binary black hole in the cluster propelling psr - a , this binary can not act as a local perturber on the two pulsars .",
    "it is too light .",
    "the `` best '' candidate for the local perturber hypothesis is our intermediate - mass binary black hole ( the @xmath136 binary ) .",
    "the binary is sufficiently light so it can still random walk across the core to produce the local acceleration of the two pulsars .",
    "if instead the acceleration of psr - e , psr - e ( and perhaps psr - d ) is caused by the overall effect of the cluster potential well , the single intermediate - mass black hole plays a role but some additional mass should be present in the form of collapsed remnants such as white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "black hole binaries are special",
    "_ catalysts _ for the formation of `` stable '' triplets .",
    "the interaction of a binary pulsar with an intermediate - mass binary black hole can create an extraordinary system : _ a millisecond pulsar - black hole - black hole hierarchical triple _ ( the companion star leaving the system ) .",
    "the single intermediate - mass black hole may , on the other hand , host in its cusp a millisecond pulsar . in this perspective , timing measurements on this `` planetary - like - pulsar '' , either member of a triplet or of the cusp , would give the unique possibility of discriminating the nature , either single or binary , of the black hole(s ) , providing also a reliable estimate of their mass .",
    "this opportunity exists in globular clusters contrary to the case of the galactic center , where the signal from a millisecond pulsar belonging to the cusp of our central black hole would be completely smeared out by scattering in the interstellar medium .",
    "a binary black hole may steadily perturb its environment ( @xmath201 8.2 ) .",
    "the distinction between a stellar - mass and an intermediate - mass binary black hole is subtle and difficult to separate out .",
    "accurate evolutionary models of clusters hosting a binary black hole of various masses need to be developed as they can indicate the fingerprints left by such exotic binaries .",
    "they also may provide clues for discriminating between the single versus binary nature of the central black hole(s ) that may inhabit ngc 6752 .    during the revision of this manuscript ferraro et al .",
    "( 2003b ) reported the discovery of the optical identification of the companion star to psr - a , a helium white dwarf .",
    "the derived cooling age ( @xmath202 gyr ) suggests that the dynamical encounter responsible for the ejection of psr - a into the cluster halo occurred after the neutron star was recycled or was triggered at the time of ejection . in the last case",
