    "one of the key questions in the evolution of galaxies concerns the epoch of maximum star formation . since in the milky way star formation takes place in molecular clouds ,",
    "the presence of large amounts of molecular gas in distant galaxies would be an indication that they are undergoing prodigious star formation .",
    "for this reason it is important to find and study molecular gas in the most distant galaxies .",
    "the first high redshift galaxy to be detected in molecular emission lines was irasf10214 + 4724 at @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "several @xmath9 lines were detected ( @xcite ) which would indicate a molecular gas mass of @xmath10m@xmath7kms@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and a deceleration parameter @xmath11 ; values quoted from other papers are , where necessary , tacitly converted to this cosmology .",
    "] , dominating the dynamical mass .",
    "however , recently it was discovered that iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 is gravitationally lensed ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the estimated lensing factor between 3 and 20 , its true molecular gas mass may be only @xmath13m@xmath7 .",
    "since the discovery of co emission from iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 , confirmed molecular line emission has been detected in one other high redshift object , the also gravitationally lensed `` cloverleaf '' quasar h@xmath121413 + 117 at @xmath14 ( @xcite ) . in spite of the uncertain lensing factor ( estimated @xmath15 )",
    "this quasar must also contain a large amount of molecular gas .",
    "noteworthy is that both the cloverleaf quasar and iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 have an agn - type spectrum ( see elston et al .",
    "1994 ) , i.e. , a spectrum with high ionization lines produced by a hard ultraviolet continuum . in spite of this ionizing continuum",
    "there is a large mass in molecular gas apparently shielded from the uv radiation so that the molecules can survive .",
    "in addition , there have been reports on possible co emission from damped ly@xmath16 absorption systems ( @xcite ) , but more sensitive observerations could not confirm these ( braine et al . 1996 , wiklind and combes 1994 ) .",
    "the discovery of the strong co emission from iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 indicated that it might be possible to observe molecular gas out to the highest currently known redshifts and suggested that many high redshift objects might contain large amounts of molecular gas .",
    "high redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) usually have very bright ly@xmath16 emission , with integrated fluxes of @xmath17erg s@xmath3 @xmath18 ( luminosities @xmath19ergs@xmath3 ) , and can extend over more than @xmath20 ( @xmath21kpc ) , indicating the presence of a large reservoir of gas in and around these galaxies .",
    "the importance of hzrgs for the formation and evolution of galaxies in general is shown by the fact that radio galaxies were almost a thousand times more common at @xmath22 than at the current epoch .",
    "the bright emission lines in the optical spectra of hzrgs are a factor of @xmath23 narrower than those of quasars , facilitating an accurate determination of their redshifts , which is a prerequisite for deep mm - wave spectroscopy due to the limited spectral bandwidth of current instrumentation .",
    "it has been proposed that hzrgs are protogalaxies undergoing their first major burst of star formation ( see eales and rawlings 1993 , and references therein ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "radio galaxies have molecular gas masses of the order of 10@xmath24m@xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such masses are comparable to those of known luminous infrared starburst galaxies like arp@xmath12220 ( @xcite ) .",
    "high redshift radio galaxies have been suspected of having vigorous starbursts associated with the propagation of the radio jet ( @xcite ) as one of the explanations of the alignment of the optical , infrared and radio axes found in hzrgs ( @xcite ) , although alternatives have been proposed as well ( cf . , sect .",
    "the starburst model proposed by chambers and charlot ( 1990 ) requires the formation of @xmath6m@xmath7 of stars over @xmath25 yr .",
    "such starbursts should be accompanied by the production of large amounts of heavy elements , giving rise to the formation of copious amounts of dust and molecules .",
    "evidence for the presence of dust comes from polarization measurements of hzrgs ( e.g. , tadhunter et al .  1992 ; cimatti et al .",
    "1993 ) and detections of continuum emission from dust at submillimetre wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of large amounts of molecular gas in such objects would be strong evidence in favour of the massive starburst hypotheses .    in an extensive survey of ultrasteep spectrum radio sources",
    "we have found 29 radio galaxies at @xmath0 ( @xcite ) , a significant fraction of the total number of radio galaxies known at such high redshifts .",
    "the large luminosities of the observed emission lines indicate that there is a powerful source of ionizing radiation in such objects , albeit hidden from the observers .",
    "any molecular gas would have to be shielded from this ionizing radiation ( as in iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 and the cloverleaf quasar ) to prevent the molecules from dissociating .",
    "the anisotropic ionizing radiation is most likely oriented in a cone along the radio axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus most molecular gas might be situated outside this cone of ionizing radiation and is likely undisturbed by the radio jet , which may be responsible for the large velocity dispersions of the extended optical emission line gas ( van ojik et al .",
    "thus , we may expect any co emission lines to be much narrower than the optical emission lines ( which have typically @xmath26kms@xmath3 fwhm ) and similar in width to the co line widths observed both in irasf10214 + 4724 and the cloverleaf quasar ( @xmath27kms@xmath3 fwhm ) .",

    "our targets have redshifts ranging from 2.0 to 4.3 .",
    "taking into account the instrumentation available , this allowed us to survey co transitions from @xmath28 ( 345.8ghz rest frequency ) for the objects with @xmath22 observed at iram or the owens valley radio observatory millimeter interferometer ( ovro ) in the 3 mm window , to @xmath29 ( 1036.9ghz rest frequency ) for the objects with the highest redshifts observing at the jcmt in the 1.3 mm window . with the vla the co @xmath30 transition can be observed at 25ghz for the sources with the highest redshifts .",
    "strategies for detecting co at high @xmath31 have been discussed by van der werf and israel ( 1996 ) , who show that if conditions in these objects are similar to those in local starburst galaxies , the @xmath32 to @xmath33 lines are the transitions of choice in detection experiments .",
    "significantly , the line ratios found in iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 and the cloverleaf quasar are indeed similar to those in local starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) .    with the exception of b2@xmath120902 + 34 ( lilly 1988 ) and 8c1435 + 635 ( lacy et al .",

    "one target , 0211@xmath34122 , has an optical spectrum similar to that of iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 , with strongly absorbed ly@xmath16 indicating the presence of dust ( @xcite ) .",
    "four other targets were selected because they showed evidence for associated hi absorption ( van ojik et al .",

    "1990 and references therein ) .",
    "although it is possible that our hzrgs contain amounts of molecular gas similar to the ulirgs , they can not contain much more .",
    "the two high @xmath31 objects with confirmed detections of emission from molecular gas , iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 and the cloverleaf quasar , are both gravitationally lensed .",
    "this could explain why the present and other searches for molecular gas in high redshift galaxies and quasars have been unsuccessful so far and might be taken as a discouragement for further searches .",
    "however , for the two objects detected the lensing amplification is unlikely to be much more than a factor of 1020 ( @xcite ) , which , although rendering the true co flux density too low for current instrumentation , may be observable in the future .",
    "the amplification of the flux densities of iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 and the cloverleaf quasar imply that the underlying systems are not necessarily of extraordinary properties .",
    "although still quite luminous and with @xmath119m@xmath7 of molecular gas quite gas - rich galaxies , they may well be `` normal '' active galaxies in the early universe , so that that many active galaxies , quasars and radio galaxies at high @xmath31 may contain similar amounts of molecular gas .",
    "the detection of submillimetre continuum emission from a number of high redshift radio galaxies and quasars in several searches ( @xcite ) has been used to estimate gas masses using simple assumptions on the dust temperature and gas / dust ratio .",
    "the estimates of molecular gas masses of @xmath120m@xmath7 from these continuum observations are not in contradiction with the non - detections of molecular gas in these objects and our sample of hzrgs .",
    "far - infrared luminosities of @xmath121l@xmath7 , as implied by the submillimetre dust detections , imply star formation rates of @xmath122m@xmath7yr@xmath3 if the fir luminosity is powered by star formation . by extrapolating from the somewhat lower luminosity ( @xmath123l@xmath7 ) ultra - luminous iras galaxies ( @xcite ) , a value @xmath124 of @xmath125l@xmath7/m@xmath7",
    "is expected at these luminosities .",
    "the implied molecular masses are of the order of @xmath6m@xmath7 , only slightly more than the present upper limits .",
    "one of the explanations proposed for the strong alignment of the optical , near - infrared and radio axes of hzrgs ( @xcite ) is that vigorous starbursts are associated with the propagation of the radio jet ( @xcite ) . in some of these radio jet - induced star formation scenarios , star formation rates of the order of @xmath126m@xmath7yr@xmath3 over a period of @xmath127yrs",
    "are invoked to explain the alignment effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "such star formation rates would imply that a mass of order @xmath128m@xmath7 in ( molecular ) gas is converted into stars .",
    "the fact that we do not observe such quantities of ( enriched ) molecular gas in any high redshift radio galaxy is relevant to this scenario and can have two explanations :    1 .",
    "the hzrgs that we observe have already consumed most of their molecular gas and formed the bulk of their stellar population .",
    "jet - induced star formation may have played a role , but we are observing the object in a later phase where the radio source has already expanded into a powerful faranoff - riley  ii ( fr - ii ) type source with an aligned stellar component in the galaxy hosting the radio source .",
    "mazzarella et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found molecular gas in several low redshift radio galaxies detected with iras , but not in the most powerful fr - ii radio galaxies .",
    "they suggested that the powerful fr - ii galaxies might be in a later phase where most of the molecular gas has been converted into stars .",
    "2 .   the alignment effect may not be due to jet - induced star formation , but to another mechanism ( cf .",
    ", mccarthy 1993 for a review ) such as scattering of continuum radiation emitted along the radio axis from a hidden agn ( @xcite ) , anisotropic density distributions in the surrounding gas ( eales 1992 ) and inverse compton scattering ( daly 1992 ) .",
    "the passage of the radio jet still enhances star formation , but star formation would be not much more than in local starburst galaxies , up to @xmath129m@xmath7yr@xmath3 .",
    "the possibility of a large amount of very cold molecular mass ( temperature of a few k , as in the inner disk of m31 , allen & lequeux 1993 ) is ruled out , because the gas can not be colder than the cosmic microwave background which is @xmath130k at @xmath131 , so that co lines up to @xmath28 would always be relatively strong ( @xcite ) .",
    "although such cold gas may show no emission from the higher co transitions , the lack of co(10 ) and co(32 ) emission observed in our data indicates that even if the co is cold , there must be less than @xmath132m@xmath7 in molecular gas .",
    "it is unlikely that metallicity effects play a major role .",
    "the co - h@xmath5 conversion factor @xmath16 scales with co abundance @xmath133 approximately as @xmath134^{-1/4}$ ] ( radford et al.1991 ; solomon et al.1992a ) as long as the co lines are optically thick . abundance effects thus only begin to play a role when the co lines become optically thin , which requires an abundance of several orders of magnitude below solar . while this situation can not be ruled out , the presence of large masses of dust as revealed by thermal submm emission in several of our targets , and the high metallicities indicated by the optical spectrum of 0211@xmath34122 ( van ojik et al .",
    "1994 ) indicate otherwise .",
    "simultaneously , the dust will shield the molecules from dissociation by the uv continuum , as is also the case in iras@xmath12f10214 + 4724 and the cloverleaf quasar ( cf .",
    ", sect .  1 ) .",
    "we have searched for co emission in a sample of 14 high redshift radio galaxies between @xmath135 and 4.3 . in none of these galaxies",
    "have we found consistent evidence for co emission .    for a co - h@xmath5 conversion factor similar to the galactic value , we find 2@xmath1 upper limits to the molecular mass of less than @xmath136m@xmath7 .",
    "the upper limits to the molecular gas mass in hzrgs suggests that they are not forming stars at rates of @xmath137m@xmath7 yr@xmath3 which was previously suggested in some jet induced star formation scenarios to explain the optical - radio alignment effect .",
    "this may mean that ( i ) all powerful hzrgs have already converted their gas into stars , possibly through jet induced star formation , or ( ii ) jet induced star formation does not play an important role in the alignment effect but hzrgs may still be star forming at the rate of local starburst galaxies .",
