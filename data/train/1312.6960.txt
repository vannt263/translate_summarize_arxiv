    "determination of protein structure is important for understanding protein functions@xcite .",
    "the classical techniques for protein structure determination include x - ray crystallography , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , and electron microscopy , etc .",
    "these determination techniques , however , suffer from the limitations of both expensive costs and long determination period , leading to the ever - increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and that of solved protein structures@xcite .",
    "therefore , computational methods to predict protein structures from sequences are becoming increasing important to narrow down the gap@xcite .",
    "+ depending on whether protein structure homologues have been empirically solved or not , the protein structure prediction approaches can be categorized into three families : homology modeling@xcite , threading@xcite , and _ ab initio _ methods@xcite .",
    "homology modeling approaches exploit the fact that two protein sharing similar sequences often have similar structures , and threading methods compare the target sequence against a set of known protein structures and report the structure with the highest score as the predicted structure .",
    "although homology modeling and threading approaches generally yield high quality predictions , the two approaches can not help us understand the thermodynamic mechanism during the the protein folding process .",
    "+ in contrast to homology modeling and threading techniques , _ ab initio _ prediction methods work without requirements of known similar protein structures . briefly speaking , _ ab initio",
    "_ prediction methods are based on the `` thermodynamic hypothesis '' , i.e. the native structure of a protein should be the highly populated one with sufficiently low energy .",
    "for example , rosetta@xcite , one of the successful _ ab initio _ prediction tools , employs the monte carlo strategy to search conformations assembled from fragments of known structures , and finally reports the centroid of a large cluster of low - energy conformations .",
    "+ one of the key components of _ ab initio _ prediction approaches is designing an effective energy function@xcite . typically , an energy function consists of a variety of energy terms characterizing different structural features , especially the interplay between local and global interactions among residues .",
    "for example , the hydrophobic interaction term is designed to capture the observed tendency of non - polar residues to aggregate in aqueous solution and exclude water molecules .",
    "van der waals force term , is the sum of the attractive or repulsive forces among residues .",
    "hydrogen bonding term describes the electromagnetic attractive interaction between polar molecules in which hydrogen is bound to highly electronegative atom oxygen in the carboxyl @xcite .",
    "+ it is critical for an energy function to be able to distinguish native - like conformations from non - native decoy conformations , and drive as much as possible initial conformations to the native - like one in the conformation search process . to achieve these two objectives ,",
    "a widely - used strategy is to maximize the correlation between the energy and the structural similarity of the decoys and the native structure , besides requiring the native structure to be the lowest one.@xcite inspired by the `` funnel - shaped free energy surface '' idea , fain et al.@xcite proposed a funnel sculpting technique to generate an energy function step by step until a random starting conformation `` roll '' into the native - like neighborhood . and funnel landscapes describe how protein topology determines folding kinetics .",
    "@xcite shell et al.@xcite attempts to smooth energy function to make the energy landscape a funnel .",
    "+ there are usually multiple terms in energy function , e.g. rosetta utilizes a total of @xmath1 terms in residue - level conformation search phase , and over @xmath2 terms in the full - atom mode ; therefore , it is important to finding the optimal weighting of so many energy terms .",
    "schafer et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a linear programming to ensure the native conformation is more stable than decoys , while in our methods , a series of decoys are sampled to describe the basin near the native conformation .",
    "this study focuses on designing an optimal weighting of a total of @xmath1 energy terms used in rosetta .",
    "central to our effort is the `` reverse sampling '' technique , i.e. rosetta applies monte carlo technique to approach a native - like conformation , while our model attempts to generate from the native state an ensemble of initial conformations most relevant to the native state .",
    "a linear program was proposed to enlarge as much as possible the set of initial conformations that can `` roll '' into the native - like neighborhood .",
    "this way , the possibility of successful search and the quality of predicted conformation increase as the `` basin of attraction '' of the native structure is extended .",
    "+ the manuscript is organized as follows : section @xmath3 describes the whole framework of our method , and the lp model to optimize protein energy weights as well .",
    "section @xmath0 lists experimental results of the optimized energy function . in section @xmath4",
    ", we will discuss some limitations of our method and possible future works .",
    "our weight optimizing technique works in an iterative manner ; that is , we start with a uniform weighting scheme , i.e. all terms have the same weight , and proceed with rounds of alternating estimation of native - like neighborhood and enlargement of the neighborhood .",
    "the two - steps procedure is repeated until the weights change between successive iterations is sufficiently small .",
    "the details of the two steps are described in the following subsections :      as mentioned above , it is critical for an energy function to drive as much as possible initial assembled conformations to the native - like structures in the conformation search process .",
    "intuitively , the initial assembled conformations are said to lie in the `` attraction basin '' of the native structure , or native - like neighborhood , if the conformations can finally evolve to the native structure during the search process .",
    "we first describe how to estimate the native - like neighborhood .",
    "+ we utilized a `` reverse sampling '' technique to determine the native - like neighborhood under a specific energy function . here",
    ", the term `` reverse sampling '' is introduced to describe the conformation generating process essentially reverse to the conformation search process used by _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "+ in particular , _ ab initio _ methods usually employ monte carlo technique to search native - like conformations from a random initial conformation . at each step",
    ", a perturbation of the current conformation is made via fragment replacing in rosetta@xcite or torsion angle sampling in falcon@xcite to generate a new conformation .",
    "the newly generated conformation is accepted if it has lower energy relative to the original conformation ; otherwise the new conformation will be accepted with a probability according to the metropolis - hasting rule@xcite ( see figure 1 , left panel ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that starting from some initial conformations , the probability to reach the native - like structures might be very low .",
    "+ by `` reverse sampling '' , we mean that the sampling process starts from the native structure , and attempt to find a neighboring conformation with higher energy at each step ( see figure 1 , right panel ) .",
    "two constraints were imposed onto the `` reverse sampling '' process :    * at each step , the newly generated neighboring conformation should not be too far from the original one . here , we require that the rmsd ( root mean square deviation ) of the two conformations to be less than 0.5 angstrom . *",
    "the reverse sampling process ends at a conformation if we failed to find one of its neighboring conformations with higher energy after multiple trials , say 1000 times in the study . informally , this conformation is called `` edge point '' conformation of the attraction basin .    this way , a path of conformations @xmath5 is generated by the reverse sampling process , where @xmath6 denotes the native structure",
    ", @xmath7 @xmath8 denotes inter - mediate conformations , and @xmath9 denotes the final edge point conformation . for the edge point",
    "conformation @xmath9 , its @xmath10 neighboring conformations are sampled and denoted as @xmath11 . in our study , @xmath10 is set as 1000 .",
    "the rmsd between @xmath6 and @xmath9 is calculated as a rough measure of the attraction basin radius .          intuitively , if we can `` cut off '' the edge point conformation , the attraction basin of the native structure will be enlarged since the reverse sampling process will not stuck at the conformation yet .",
    "the `` cutting off '' operation is accomplished via tuning the weights of the energy terms to decrease the energy of @xmath9 to be less than at least one of its neighbors @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "meanwhile , the new weighting should still keep the order of the inter - mediate conformations in the path , i.e. the energy of @xmath7 should be still lower than that of the conformation @xmath14 .",
    "figure 2 intuitively shows how the conformation path changes during the energy function optimization .",
    "the weights tuning process is accomplished using the following linear program : @xmath15 where the vector @xmath16 denotes the weights of energy terms , and @xmath17 denotes the original weights .",
    "thus , the objective of the linear program is to find a new weight with change as small as possible . for an inter - mediate conformation @xmath7 in the reverse sampling path",
    ", @xmath18 denotes the vector of its energy terms , i.e. @xmath19 . formula ( 1 ) describes a restriction that the original relative order of @xmath7 and @xmath14 should be kept even using the new weights , and formula ( 2 ) is set to `` cut off '' the edge point conformation , i.e. at least one of the @xmath10 neighbors of the edge point conformation has a higher energy .",
    "thus , @xmath9 is no longer an edge point conformation under the new weights .",
    "for proteins in different classes , different energy terms might emphasized .",
    "thus , we evaluate the weights optimizing procedure on three proteins with different scop classes . the detail information of the three proteins are listed in table 1 .",
    "[ info ]    .benchmark protein structures used in the study .",
    "the @xmath0 proteins come from @xmath0 different scop classes : all @xmath20 ( class a ) , @xmath20/@xmath21 ( class c ) , @xmath20+@xmath21 ( class d ) .",
    "residue numbers are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , respectively . columns @xmath25 and @xmath26 shows the number and total length of @xmath20 helices and @xmath21 strands . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ finalweights ]      we also investigated whether the `` cutting off edge point '' strategy helps enlarge the attraction basin of the native structure . to estimate the attraction basin ,",
    "a total of 100 paths of conformations were generated using the `` reverse sampling '' technique from the native structure .",
    "the rmsd between the starting native structure and the edge point conformations are calculate as a rough estimation of the radius of the attraction basin . as shown in figure 3 ,",
    "the mean rmsd of the @xmath27 trials is @xmath26 angstrom initially , and increases to nearly @xmath1 angstrom finally .",
    "this suggests that the attraction basin is really significantly enlarged during the iteration process .",
    "finally we conducted experiments to investigate whether the optimized weights help improve protein structure prediction or not . to achieve this goal , we run rosetta for the testing proteins with weights obtained at each iteration step . for each weighting scheme ,",
    "a total of 1000 decoys were generated by rosetta . among these decoys ,",
    "a clustering procedure is run and the centroid of the largest cluster is reported as the final prediction .",
    "the `` good decoy ratio '' is also calculated . here",
    ", we adopted a widely - used criteria that a decoy is called `` good decoy '' if it has a rmsd less than @xmath26 angstrom to the native structure@xcite .",
    "+ taking protein 1iloa as an example , the best prediction has a rmsd of @xmath28 angstrom ( see figure 6 , left panel ) , and as iteration proceeds the quality of the best prediction improves step by step and finally the best prediction has a small rmsd of only @xmath29 angstrom ( see figure 6 , right panel ) .",
    "similar trends were observed for protein 1ctfa and 1iloa ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "+ in addition , the `` good decoy ratio '' was also improved significantly ( see figure 5 ) . for example , if using the initial weights , there are only 10 good decoy among the @xmath30 decoys generated by rosetta for protein 1iloa ; in contrast , there are over @xmath31 good decoys among the @xmath30 generated decoys when using the optimized weights .",
    "this means that using the optimized weights of energy function , rosetta can generate high - quality decoys more efficiently .",

    "in the study , we present an attempt to find the optimal weights of energy terms .",
    "the basic idea is to estimate the attraction basin of the native structure using `` reverse sampling '' technique , and then enlarge the attraction basin using a linear program .",
    "experimental results on several benchmark proteins suggest that the optimized weights can significantly improve rosetta s prediction , and the prediction efficiency is substantially increased as well . + it has been reported that the energy terms apply at different stages of protein folding . according to this observation , rosetta employs a multi - step prediction strategy . in particular , rosetta",
    "first uses score function @xmath32 with only hydrophobic core terms , then uses @xmath33 with secondary structure terms , and finally uses @xmath34 to incorporate more energy terms .",
    "the study here focuses on the optimization of weights for the third step . +",
    "our work focuses on the attraction basin near the native structure .",
    "when we get a conformation with over @xmath35 angstrom to the native structure , the reverse sampling ends since a conformation with so large rmsd is usually a random conformation .",
    "the random conformations are excluded since they provide little information for the attraction basin .",
    "+ one of the limitations of the study presented here is the limited number of benchmark proteins .",
    "the weights were trained for each protein individually .",
    "ideally , we have only a common weighting scheme for a protein class rather than a specific weighting for an individual protein .",
