    "there is a wealth of literature available on the highly isotropic nature of cosmic - rays ( crs ) observed at the earth ( see e.g. the references given in thoudam 2007 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the cr anisotropy amplitude is only @xmath5 in the energy range of @xmath6 ( guillian et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) with the phase ( direction ) mainly found in the outer galaxy , particularly in the second quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "the possible explanations for the anisotropy are generally beleived to be the global diffusion leakage of crs from the galaxy , the random nature of the cr sources in space - time and the effect of the local sources . in paper",
    "i , the effect of the known local supernova remnants ( snrs ) has been studied in detail by giving more emphasis to the particle release time .",
    "the study found that the observed anisotropy data favour the burst - like injection model if particles are released from the sources at an age of @xmath7 .",
    "the continuous injection model gives an anisotropy which is too large to explain the observed data .",
    "however , paper i considered the cr diffusion zone as an unbounded three - dimensional space which is actually too far from the real geometry of the galaxy .",
    "the present work is a continuation of the earlier work , but considers the diffusion region as a flat cylindrical disc having both radial and the vertical boundaries .    in the present study ,",
    "the propagation of crs is assumed to follow the same diffusion equation given in paper i. the solution will be applied to local snrs and the results will be compared to those obtained in paper i for the burst - like model of particle injection .",
    "in the diffusion model , neglecting convection , energy losses and particle losses due to nuclear interactions , the propagation of cr protons in the galaxy is given by the equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the differential number density , @xmath10 is the proton kinetic energy , @xmath11 with @xmath12 constant ( positive ) is the diffusion coefficient which is assumed to be spatially uniform in the galaxy and @xmath13 is the proton production rate .",
    "the cr propagation region is assumed to be a cylindrical box bounded in both the radial and vertical directions , and our calculation takes into acount the exact location of the sources with respect to the earth .",
    "inspite of the fact that the actual spatial distribution of observed snrs extent as far as @xmath14 from the galactic plane ( stupar et al .",
    "2007 ) , most of the cr propagation studies assume the sources to be uniformly distributed in a thin disc of half - thickness @xmath15 .",
    "such an approximation is valid in the study of global properties of galactic crs since majority of the sources are confined within @xmath16 from the plane .",
    "but , in studies like the present one where the effects of nearby discrete sources are discussed , the actual position of the sources should be considered since , for example , for the same source distance @xmath17 we expect to see different cr fluxes at different source heights due to the presence of the vertical halo boundary .",

    "2(d ) where the calculations are performed at @xmath85 . note that this value of particle injection time is that at which the model calculated anisotropy values are close to the observed data ( see the results of paper i ) .",
    "the anisotropy here is determined solely by the monogem snr in the whole energy range considered here , and only those results for @xmath86 show considerable variation from the @xmath79 line .",
    "the results for @xmath87 show a negligible deviation . combining all the results of fig .",
    "2 , we can finally conclude that the effect of the halo boundary of our galaxy on the local snr contribution to the observed cr anisotropy is negligible as long as the boundary is greater than @xmath88 . in the next section",
    ", we will combine this result along with the halo heights obtained by several authors to discuss the importance of @xmath0 in the anisotropy study due to local sources .",
    "the effect of the nearby cr sources is considered as one of the important effects that can give rise to the observed cr anisotropy at the earth .",
    "however , the calculation of cr fluxes from any type of source in the galaxy essentially requires the use of the proper geometry of the galaxy as well as the actual position of the source with respect to the observer .",
    "since our galaxy has a cylindrical geometry with the radius much larger than the height , the radial boundary is found to have a negligible effect on the cr density and hence the geometry can be approximated by an infinite radius with a finite vertical height .",
    "furthermore , this study has found that the effect of the vertical halo boundary on the local snr contribution to the cr anisotropy is negligible if @xmath89 .",
    "2 shows the effect of the halo height on the cr anisotropy due to nearby known sources for different particle injection times . among the 13 snrs considered , only monogem , vela , g299.2 - 2.9 , sn185 and cygnus loop",
    "are found to determine the anisotropy at different energy intervals . also , all of them except sn185 ( with @xmath90 ) have distances @xmath91 .",
    "this shows that only the nearest sources mainly determine the anisotropy as expected , and hence this results in a negligible halo height effect for @xmath87 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the vertical heights of the dominant sources above the galactic plane are found to be less than @xmath92 which is much less than the halo heights @xmath93 considered here .",
    "the actual value of the halo height of our galaxy is not exactly known .",
    "its value is generally obtained along with other propagation parameters using the observed cr data like the secondary@xmath94primary ratios , cr density distribution etc .",
    "but , the values obtained from the same experimental data are different for different cr propagation models .",
    "webber , lee @xmath63 gupta ( 1992 ) had obtained a value of @xmath95 using diffusion - convection model .",
    "lukasiak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) had obtained @xmath96 using the webber et al .",
    "( 1992 ) model without convection .",
    "webber @xmath63 soutoul ( 1998 ) obtained @xmath97 and @xmath98 using the diffusion and monte carlo models respectively .",
    "other results like those of freedman et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and ptuskin @xmath63 soutoul ( 1998 ) obtained @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively . a completely numerical approach using more realistic physical conditions of the galaxy determined a value of @xmath101 for the diffusion - convection model and @xmath102 for the re - acceleration model ( strong @xmath63 moskalenko 1998 ) .",
    "these results are found to be consistent with the observations of galactic radio emission structure at 408 mhz which indicate the presence of a thick radio disk with full equivalent width of @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the galactic radial range of @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively ( beuermann et al .",
    "1985 ) , but such a wide range of values makes the galactic halo height a very uncertain parameter in cr propagation studies .",
    "however , since most of the values obtained are found to have @xmath1 , the conclusion given in the previous section suggests that the study of local crs due to nearby snrs can be carried out without having much information on @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the effect of the nearest sources @xmath109 dominates over the influence of the other nearby sources and the cr fluxes from these sources are almost independent of the halo boundary for @xmath89 as discussed before .",
    "hence , the study of the effect of local sources on the cr anisotropy at the earth can be done using the much simpler three - dimensional unbounded solution .",
    "for the infinite boundary case , if a single source dominates the anisotropy in the whole energy range as in fig .",
    "2(d ) , the total anisotropy follows an energy dependence of the form @xmath110 in the high energy regime ( paper i ) , which for @xmath111 goes as @xmath112 .",
    "such a decrease with energy is in fact observed in the high energy anisotropy data somewhere above @xmath113 upto around @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , the increase in anisotropy from @xmath5 in the @xmath115 energy range can also be possibly explained by a proper choice of @xmath116 or rather @xmath117 for the single dominant source .",
    "we try to estimate the physical parameters of such a source that best fit the data .",
    "the best - fitting parameters are found to be @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and the best - fitting line is shown as the thick dashed line in fig .",
    "thus , for @xmath50 the source should have an age of @xmath120 . however , it is possible to obtain a number of @xmath121 combinations which equally fit the data , all of them giving the same value of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , the present study only gives an estimate of the distance to the single dominant source ; it does not give any precise information on the age and the particle release time of the source .",
    "it should be noted that it is not the individual @xmath121 values that determine the contribution of the source , but the propagation time @xmath123 of the particles after their release from the source .",
    "we can determine the best - fitting @xmath28- value only if we know @xmath82 , but the value of @xmath82 is not exactly known .",
    "it may even be that @xmath82 is an energy - dependent parameter , i.e. particles with different energies emitted at different times .",
    "studies based on diffusive shock acceleration in snrs have shown that the highest energy particles start leaving the source region already at the beginning of the sedov phase ( berezhko et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the major fraction of accelerated crs remain confined for almost around @xmath124 for an interstellar medium ( ism ) hydrogen atom density of @xmath125 .",
    "this implies that for the local ism which has @xmath126 ( see e.g. thoudam 2006b and references therein ) , if a single source determines the whole anisotropy , the source should have a characteristic age of @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no nearby known snr with such an age located at @xmath127 .",
    "however , it is quite possible that the single dominant source may be an _ undetected _ old snr .",
    "in fact , studies assuming adiabatic phase in snr evolution have shown that the surface brightness of an snr of age @xmath128 yrs lies below the detection limit of radio telescopes ( leahy @xmath63 xinji 1989 ) .",
    "the present result is further supported by the fact that almost all the nearby sources are quite young with estimated ages less than @xmath129 ( the generally accepted particle release time ) , and they might not have released the crs into the local ism . in addition , the possiblity that some of the observed features of crs may be due to _ undetected _ nearby sources can not be simply ignored .",
    "the single - source explanation of the observed cr properties can also be found in some earlier works ( e.g. ew 2000 and references therein ; ew 2006 , etc . ) , but in a somewhat different context .",
    "ew 2000 claimed that the knee in the cr spectrum at @xmath130 can be attributed to the presence of a single recent supernova ( as yet unidentified ) in the local region . on the other hand ,",
    "ew 2006 tried to explain the rise in the anisotropy amplitude as well as the change in its phase near the knee using a single source exploded in the direction from the sun downward of the main cr flux , which are predominantly coming from the inner galaxy .",
    "the latter study considered the source parameters as similar to those of the monogem snr .",
    "although the single source idea has not been readily accepted by the cr community , at the same time there is no reason why it should be just neglected .",
    "the present study even points out one more observed property of crs that can possibly be explained by the single source model .",

    "<S> the study has found that the effect of the vertical halo boundary @xmath0 on the local snr contribution to the observed cr anisotropy is negligible as long as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> considering the values of the halo height @xmath1 obtained by different authors , the present work suggests that the study of the effect of local sources on the cr anisotropy can be carried out without having much information on @xmath0 and hence , using the much simpler three - dimentional unbounded solution . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the present work discusses about the possibility of explaining the observed anisotropy below the knee by a single dominant source with properly chosen source parameters , and claims that the source may be an _ undetected _ old snr with a characteristic age of @xmath2 located at a distance of @xmath3 from the sun .    </S>",
