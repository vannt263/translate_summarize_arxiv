    "the study of the reflection of light from a moving mirror has been a fundamental theme since the inception of relativity .",
    "in particular the reflection law was obtained using the lorentz transformation @xcite as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath2 is velocity of mirror , @xmath3 is the angle of incidence and @xmath4 is the angle of reflection .",
    "the angles and the mirror velocity are measured with respect to the same axis normal to the mirror .",
    "there are derivations of the reflection law without using the lorentz transformation @xcite , however here we focus on a geometric approach using well - known properties of conic sections .    consider a ray of light that is emanated from a point source at position @xmath5 at time @xmath6 and reaches a second point @xmath7 after reflection from the moving mirror .",
    "fermat principle requires the trajectory to be such that it minimizes the travel time over all paths .",
    "these paths start at @xmath5 at @xmath6 and bend at the point of intersection with the moving mirror before reaching @xmath7 .",
    "this prompts the following definition :    the effective surface of reflection , @xmath8 , is the loci of the intersection of all beams , emanating from the stationary source at a given time @xmath6 , with the moving mirror .",
    "we propose to derive the relativistic reflection law by applying fermat principle to esr .",
    "if a ray of light is emanated from a point source at a position @xmath5 at time @xmath6 and reaches a second point @xmath7 after reflection from a mirror then the path it takes is the one minimizing the time from @xmath5 to @xmath9 to @xmath7 .    to measure the time of flight we need the speed of light before and after the incidence",
    "the second principle of relativity states that the speed of light in vacuum is independent of the movement of its source .",
    "in particular the incident and reflected beam travel at the same speed in vacuum .",
    "now we are ready to state the main result of this paper .    if the speed of the reflected beam is same as the incident beam then the reflection angle calculated by the fermat principle is same as the one predicted by the special theory of relativity .",
    "esr , for a flat mirror moving at a constant velocity @xmath2 , is a conic .",
    "the location of the mirror at the time of emanation is the linear directrix , the source is a focus , and the ratio of speed of light to the speed of the mirror is the eccentricity .",
    "hence the incident and the reflected rays coincide with the focal rays of the conic .",
    "the reflection law then turns out , in fact , to be the bi - angular equation @xcite of the conic .",
    "we offer two proofs , one using basic geometry , for a uniformly moving mirror , and another , using calculus , for accelerating mirrors . the lorentz transformation is not used .",
    "the solution presented is applicable to any signal bouncing from a moving boundary so long as the reflected signal has the same speed as the incident signal .",
    "while this is standard in relativity it may also occur in non - relativistic classical cases .",
    "the final section of paper discusses some of the physics aspects of the problem .",
    "we assume the source resides in vacuum or an isotropic stationary medium .",
    "in the latter case we consider a thought experiment where the movement of the mirror does not cause any motion or turbulence in the medium .",
    "the speed of light in the medium in any direction and from any source is the same constant .",
    "consider a stationary source of light at @xmath10 , and a mirror , parallel to the @xmath11-axis , that moves in the direction of @xmath12-axis with a uniform velocity of @xmath2 and at time @xmath13 is located at @xmath14 . at time @xmath6 the source emits a ray of light at an angle of @xmath15 .",
    "we find @xmath16 , the angle of reflection from the mirror using fermat principle and compare it with .",
    "the comparison of the speed of light ( or signal ) in the medium , @xmath17 , with the speed of the mirror @xmath18 results in three cases : a conventional hyperbolic case when @xmath19 , a hypothetical elliptic case when @xmath20 , and a threshold parabolic case when @xmath21 .      in this case the speed of light in the given medium is more than that of the mirror , @xmath22 .",

    "the reflection angle @xmath16 is defined as the angle of @xmath32 with @xmath62 , or @xmath63 , to conform with the pedagogical convention , where , for a stationary mirror , @xmath64 . in @xcite ,",

    "this concludes the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "while is the common form of the relativistic reflection law , other forms are possible .",
    "for example , in the triangle @xmath67 let @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and use the law of sines @xmath94 to substitute for @xmath95 and @xmath96 in @xmath97 .",
    "this results in @xmath98 or equivalently @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the angle between the normals to the mirror and to the hyperbola , and @xmath101 is the angle between the incident or the reflected ray and the normal to the hyperbola .",
    "similarly , if we define the angle @xmath102 as the value of @xmath16 when @xmath103 , i.e. through @xmath104 , then ( 2 ) reads @xmath105 .",
    "the latter can be written as @xmath106 = [   ( 1-\\cos z)/(1+\\cos z ) ]   [ ( 1-\\cos i)/(1+\\cos",

    "( a discussion on physical plausibility appears in the last section . )",
    "we will see that here the reflected beam of light is on the same side of the normal to the mirror as the incident beam .",
    "another oddity is that the image is on the same side of the mirror as the source and is real .",

    "this shows an interesting property ; for a hyperbola and an ellipse that have reciprocal eccentricities the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 match in value . however , note that in the hyperbolic case @xmath15 and @xmath16 are both interior angles of @xmath124 while in the elliptic case @xmath15 is the exterior and @xmath16 is the interior angle .      in this case the speed of mirror matches the speed of light in the given medium , @xmath21 .",

    "can become obtuse .",
    "one advantage of geometrical description is that particular events and range of angles are readily suggested by the figures .",
    "for example we see in fig  [ fig : mirrorh1.eps ] that , for the case of mirror initially moving toward the source , @xmath160 , as the incident ray rises from @xmath161 to become parallel to the left asymptote at the obtuse angle @xmath162 the reflected angle rises from @xmath161 to the acute angle @xmath163 .",
    "the obtuse angles of incidence corresponds to @xmath164 being to the left of @xmath5 . if @xmath165 no reflection will occur .",
    "( to visualize an obtuse angle of incidence consider a ball crossing the path of a bus and moving in the same general direction as the bus ; when the front fender of the bus strikes the ball . )    similarly , in the case of a receding mirror , @xmath166 , as the incidence angle increases from @xmath161 to become parallel to the right asymptote at the acute angle @xmath167 the reflected angle rises from @xmath161 to the obtuse angle @xmath163 .",

    "the critical angles , @xmath169 or @xmath170 , are not flagged by .",
    "for example as @xmath15 exceeds @xmath169 the formula continues to predict a reflection angle , even though no reflection occurs .",
    "to explain , note that remains invariant under simultaneous transformations @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "as @xmath15 exceeds @xmath169 for a receding mirror the reflected angle @xmath16 that is produced by is the supplementary angle of the reflection angle for the case of an initially approaching mirror and a supplementary angle of incidence . in other words , for a line drawn through @xmath5 with angle @xmath15 in @xmath174 both @xmath26 and @xmath24 are on the left branch .",
    "point @xmath26 is on the ray with incidence angle @xmath15 and point @xmath24 is on the ray with incidence angle @xmath110 .      in the elliptic case , assuming a conventional mirror is involved , no regular reflection can occur since now light is not fast enough to separate from the mirror .",
    "however a hypothetical substance that functions as a `` see - through reflector '' may provide a model .",
    "to explain , consider the reflection of sound waves from a net ( as in a tennis racket ) that is moving faster than the speed of sound in air without creating air disturbance while still allowing reflection of sound waves that hit the net .",
    "now , due to the net s porous nature , the reflected beam can form behind the net .",
    "we speculate that such see - through mirrors can be constructed by electronically switching a layer of atoms inside a certain crystal into a temporary mirror . as a layer is switched on and then off then the next layer is switched on , in effect creating a moving mirror .",
    "the movement of such a mirror will not be a prohibitive physical movement , and without a barrier that will prevent the formation of the reflected beam on the opposite side of the mirror .",
    "such a scenario will allow for the speed of mirror to be higher than speed of light in the crystal and for the reflected light to form behind the mirror ."
