    "# 1       the nature of a membrane s in - plane order , with three well - studied universality classes , the isotropic liquid@xcite , hexatic liquid@xcite and solid@xcite , crucially affects its conformational properties .",
    "the most striking illustration of this ( discussed in lectures by yacov kantor and by david nelson ) is the stabilization in polymerized membranes ( but not fluid ones , that are always crumpled@xcite beyond a persistence length@xcite ) of a",
    " flat \" phase@xcite , with long - range orientational order in the local membrane normals@xcite , that is favored at low temperature over the entropically preferred high - temperature crumpled state . in a beautiful `` order from disorder ''",
    "phenomenon , a subtle interplay of wild thermal fluctuations with nonlinear membrane elasticity ( made possible by a finite shear modulus of a solid ) infinitely enhances membrane s bending rigidity , thereby stabilizing the flat phase against these very fluctuations.@xcite a universal fluctuation - driven `` anomalous elasticity '' characterizes the resulting flat phase , with length - scale dependent elastic moduli , non - hookean stress - strain relation , and a universal negative poisson ratio.@xcite    given such qualitative distinction between liquid and solid membranes , it is perhaps not too surprising that other in - plane orders can have important qualitative effects on membrane s long - scale properties . in these lectures",
    "i will discuss two such ingredients , namely , membrane network in - plane _ anisotropy _ ( section 2 ) and _ heterogeneity _ ( section 3 ) in fluctuating",
    "_ polymerized _ membranes , and will show that these seemingly innocuous generalizations , indeed lead to a wealth of new phenomena that are the subject of these lectures .",
    "in addition to the basic theoretical motivation , the interest in anisotropic polymerized membranes is naturally driven by a number of possible experimental realizations , some of which are illustrated in fig.[anisotropic_membranes ] .",
    "one example is a tethered membrane made through photo - polymerization of a fluid phospholipid membrane exhibiting lipid tilt order . on average",
    "the lipids are tilted relative to the membrane normal , inducing a vector in - plane order and an intrinsic elastic anisotropy that can in principle be aligned with an electric or a magnetic field and polymerized in .",
    "another possible method@xcite of fabricating polymerized sheets is by cross - linking a stretched out , aligned array of linear polymers , that would clearly lead to an intrinsically anisotropic tethered membrane .",
    "one other promising candidate is a two - dimensional sheet of a nematic elastomer@xcite , a material that received considerable attention recently because of its novel elastic and electro - optic properties.@xcite these cross - linked liquid - crystal polymer gels exhibit all standard liquid - crystal phases and therefore in their nematic state are highly anisotropic .",
    "almost 10 years ago , it was discovered@xcite that in - plane anisotropy has a dramatic qualitative effect on the global phase diagram of polymerized membranes . as illustrated in fig.[phasediagram_tubulef ] , it leads to an entirely new `` tubule '' phase of a polymerized membrane ( see fig.[tubuleshape ] ) , that is crumpled along one and extended along the other of the two membrane axes , with wild undulations about its average cylindrical geometry.@xcite        this is possible because in an anisotropic membrane , where symmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes is broken , ( e.g. , curvature moduli @xmath2 ) the @xmath0- and @xmath1-directed tangents @xmath3 and @xmath4 will generically order at two distinct temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , thereby allowing two intermediate tubule states : ( 1 ) @xmath0-extended tubule with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , for @xmath9 and ( 2 ) y - extended tubule with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , for @xmath12 .",
    "the direct crumpling transition occurs in such more generic anisotropic membrane only for that special set of cuts through the phase diagram ( like p@xmath13 ) that pass through the origin and is in fact tetra - critical .",
    "generic paths ( like p@xmath14 ) will experience _ two _ phase transitions , crumpled - to - tubule , and tubule - to - flat , that are in distinct universality classes .",
    "the tubule phase is therefore not only generically possible , but actually unavoidable , in membranes with any type or amount of _ intrinsic anisotropy_.@xcite    as illustrated in fig.[tubuleshape ] the tubule is characterized by its thickness @xmath15 , ( the radius of gyration of its crumpled boundary ) , and its undulations @xmath16 transverse to its average axis of orientation . quite generally , ( for a y - extended tubule of an @xmath17 membrane ) they obey the scaling laws : @xmath18 where the roughness exponent @xmath19 , and the anisotropy exponent @xmath20 are expressed in terms two independent universal exponents : the radius of gyration exponent @xmath21 and the anomalous elasticity exponent @xmath22 for the tubule bending rigidity defined by @xmath23 .",
    "the _ universal _ scaling functions @xmath24 have the limiting forms : @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radius of gyration exponent of a coiled linear polymer @xmath28 .",
    "these asymptotic forms emerge from general requirements ( supported by detailed renormalization group calculations@xcite ) that in the limit of a very thin tubule ( in the curled up @xmath29 direction ) the tubule s height undulations @xmath30 reproduce statistics of a linear polymer of length @xmath31 and width @xmath32 . and , that in the opposite limit of vanishing @xmath31 , scaling functions must recover the radius of gyration @xmath33 of a linear polymer of length @xmath32 and thickness @xmath31 .",
    "the scaling forms , eq.[fr2d ] and [ fh2d ] imply that for a `` roughly square '' membrane  that is , one with @xmath34  in the limit @xmath35 @xmath36 combining this with detailed renormalization group calculations , that find a strictly positive @xmath22,@xcite shows that @xmath37 for a large roughly square membrane .",
    "thus , the end - to - end orientational fluctuations @xmath38 as @xmath35 for such a roughly square membrane , proving that tubule order ( which requires orientational persistence in the extended direction ) _ is _ stable against undulations of the tubule embedded in @xmath39 dimensions .",
    "the rest of section [ anisotropy ] is devoted to developing a model of an anisotropic polymerized membrane and using it to study phase transitions into and out of the tubule phase and the anomalous elastic properties of a fluctuating tubule summarized above .",
    "a model for anisotropic membranes is a generalization of the isotropic model discussed in david nelson s lectures.@xcite as there , we characterize the configuration of the membrane by the position @xmath40 in the @xmath41-dimensional embedding space of the point in the membrane labeled by a @xmath42-dimensional internal co - ordinate @xmath43 , with @xmath39 and @xmath44 corresponding to the physical case of interest .",

    "lies the y - tubule phase , characterized by @xmath70 and @xmath71 : the membrane is extended in the y - direction but crumpled in all @xmath48 @xmath29-directions .",
    "the @xmath29-tubule phase is the analogous phase with the @xmath1 and @xmath29 directions reversed , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and lies between the @xmath74 segment of the line @xmath75 and the positive @xmath54 axis .",

    "although anisotropy has dramatic effects on the phase diagram of polymerized membranes , it does not modify the nature of the crumpled and flat phases.@xcite to see this for the crumpled phase note that when both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are positive , all of the other local terms in eq.[fc ] , i.e. , the @xmath52 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56-terms , are subdominant at long wavelengths .",
    "when these irrelevant terms are neglected , a simple change of variables @xmath80 makes the remaining energy isotropic .",
    "thus , the entire crumpled phase is identical in its scaling properties to that of isotropic membranes . in particular , the membrane in this phase has a radius of gyration @xmath81 which scales with membrane linear dimension @xmath82 like @xmath83 , with @xmath84 in flory theory , and very similar values predicted by @xmath85-expansion techniques.@xcite    fluctuations in the flat phase can be incorporated by considering small deviations from the mean - field conformation in eq.[ansatz ] @xmath86 where @xmath87 are @xmath42 in - plane phonon fields and @xmath88 are @xmath89 out - of - plane height undulation fields .",
    "inserting this into free energy , eq.[fc ] , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 both in the range in which the flat phase is stable , we obtain the uniaxial elastic energy studied by toner.@xcite as he showed , amazingly , fluctuation renormalize this anisotropic elastic energy into the _ isotropic _ membrane elastic energy studied previously.@xcite therefore , in the flat phase , and at sufficiently long scales , the anisotropic membranes behave exactly like isotropic ones .",
    "this in particular implies that the flat phase of anisotropic membranes is stable against thermal fluctuations even though it breaks continuous ( rotational ) symmetry and is two - dimensional.@xcite as in isotropic membranes , this is due to the fact that at long wavelengths these very thermal fluctuations drive the effective ( renormalized ) bend modulus @xmath52 to infinity@xcite , thereby suppressing effects of these same fluctuations that seek to destabilize the flat phase , resulting in an esher - like `` order - from - disorder '' phenomenon .",
    "specifically , @xmath90 becomes wavevector dependent , and diverges like @xmath91 as @xmath92 . in the flat phase the standard lam coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath94  @xcite",
    "are also infinitely renormalized and become wavevector dependent , vanishing in the @xmath95 limit as @xmath96 .",
    "the flat phase is furthermore novel in that it is characterized by a universal _ negative _ poisson ratio@xcite which for @xmath44 is defined as the long wavelength limit @xmath95 of @xmath97 .",
    "the transverse undulations in the flat phase , i.e. the membrane roughness @xmath16 scales with the internal size of the membrane as @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , exactly .",
    "furthermore , an underlying rotational invariance imposes an exact ward identity between @xmath22 and @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "this leaves only a single independent exponent , characterizing the properties of the flat phase of even anisotropic membranes .    to appreciate how exotic and unusual this",
    "anomalous elasticity really is one only needs to observe that most ordered and disordered states of matter ( systems with quenched disorder being prominent exceptions @xcite ) , are in a sense trivial , with fluctuations about them described by a harmonic theory controlled by a gaussian fixed point.@xcite that is , generically , qualitatively important effects of fluctuations are confined to the vicinity of isolated critical points , where a system is tuned to be `` soft '' , and characterized by low energy excitations .",
    "however , there exists a novel class of systems , with flat phase of polymerized membranes as a prominent member ( that also includes smectic@xcite and columnar liquid crystals@xcite , vortex lattices in putative magnetic superconductors@xcite , and nematic elastomers@xcite ) whose ordered states are a striking exception to this rule .",
    "a unifying feature of these phases is their underlying , spontaneously broken rotational invariance , that strictly enforces a particular `` softness '' of the corresponding goldstone mode hamiltonian . as a consequence ,",
    "the usually small nonlinear elastic terms are in fact comparable to harmonic ones , and therefore must be taken into account . similarly to their effects near continuous phase transitions ( where they induce universal power - law anomalies ) , but extending throughout an ordered phase , fluctuations drive nonlinearities to qualitatively modify such soft states .",
    "the resulting strongly interacting ordered states at long scales exhibit rich phenomenology such as a universal nonlocal elasticity , a strictly nonlinear response to an arbitrarily weak perturbation and a universal ratio of wavevector - dependent singular elastic moduli , all controlled by a nontrivial infrared stable fixed point illustrated in fig.[softsolidrgflow ] .",
    "the study of such anomalous elasticity in polymerized membranes was initiated by nelson and peliti using a simple one - loop self - consistent theory , that assumed a non - renormalization of the in - plane elastic lame constants.@xcite they found that phonon - mediated interaction between capillary waves leads to a divergent bending rigidity with @xmath102 and membrane roughness exponent @xmath103 .",
    "subsequent controlled @xmath104 and @xmath105 expansions@xcite confirmed existence of anomalous elasticity , and discovered an additional effect of softening ( screening ) of in - plane elasticity by out - of - plane undulations , that lead to a vanishing of long - scale lame coefficients @xmath106 .",
    "here we treat anomalous elasticity within the so - called self - consistent screening approximation ( scsa ) , first applied to the study of the flat phase of polymerized membranes by le doussal and radzihovsky@xcite .",
    "the attractive feature of scsa is that it is becomes exact in three complementary limits . by construction , it is exact in the large embedding dimension @xmath107 limit and agrees with the systematic @xmath108 analysis of guitter , et al.@xcite because of ward identities associated with rotational invariance it is exact ( at any @xmath41 ) to lowest order @xmath104 , i.e. , agrees with one - loop results of aronovitz and lubensky.@xcite ( it would be very interesting to check predictions of scsa to order @xmath109 , however technical difficulties with two - loop calculations have so far precluded this@xcite ) . and finally it gives exact value of @xmath110 for @xmath111 . given these exact constraints , it is not surprising that for physical dimensions ( @xmath44 , @xmath39 ) scsa exponents and the universal negative poisson ratio@xcite compare so well with latest , largest scale numerical simulations , discussed in lectures by mark bowick.@xcite    as discussed above , at sufficiently long scales , flat phase of an anisotropic polymerized membrane is identical to that of an isotropic one@xcite , and is described by an isotropic effective free energy that is a sum of a bending and an in - plane elastic energies : @xmath112= \\int d^dx   [ { \\kappa \\over 2 } ( \\nabla^2\\vec{h})^2      + \\mu u_{\\alpha \\beta}^2 + { \\lambda \\over 2 } u_{\\alpha \\alpha}^2 ] \\ ; , \\label{fflat}\\ ] ] where the strain tensor is @xmath113 . to implement the scsa in the flat phase it is convenient to first integrate out the noncritical phonons fields @xmath114 obtaining a quartic theory for interacting goldstone tangent vector modes @xmath115 , described by free energy @xmath116=",

    "the four - point coupling fourth - rank tensor is given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a transverse ( to @xmath119 ) projection operator .",
    "the convenience of this decomposition is that @xmath120 and @xmath93 moduli renormalize independently and multiplicatively .    to determine the renormalized elasticity",
    ", we set up a @xmath105-expansion@xcite for 2-point and 4-point correlation functions of @xmath121 , and turn them into a closed self - consistent set of two coupled integral equations for self - energy @xmath122 that define scsa @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the renormalized propagator , @xmath125 the bare quartic interaction vertex and @xmath126 the `` screened '' interaction vertex dressed by the vacuum polarization bubbles @xmath127 , and tensor multiplication is defined above . in the long wavelength limit these integral equations are solved exactly by a renormalized propagator @xmath128 , with @xmath129 a non - universal amplitude . substituting this ansatz into eqs.[sigmaeqn],[scsaeqn1 ] and solving for the renormalized elastic lam moduli , we find that indeed they must vanish as a universal power , with @xmath130 , and the phonon anomalous exponent @xmath131 related to @xmath22 by dimensional analysis ( power - counting on @xmath132 ) first obtained by nelson and peliti.@xcite this recovers the celebrated exponent relation enforced by the underlying rotational invariance of the membrane in the embedding space .",

    "to ensure an in - plane stability curvature phonon elastic energies are included in @xmath591 .    as a result , in the putative flat nematic phase of an elastomer membrane ,",
    "the phonons have qualitatively `` softer '' harmonic elasticity than in a conventional polymerized membrane discussed in sec.[anisotropy ] . consequently , as in other `` soft '' systems ( e.g. , smectic and columnar liquid crystals phases ; see discussion in sec.[flatanomelast ] ) , in the presence of thermal fluctuations and/or heterogeneities , _ nonlinear _ elastic terms are essential for the correct description .",
    "first principles derivation of the nematic elastomer model , that incorporates ( hidden ) in - plane rotational invariance at nonlinear level is somewhat involved and we refer an interested reader to recent detailed work on this subject.@xcite in short , one starts out with a model of a statistically homogeneous and isotropic elastic membrane coupled to a nematic in - plane order parameter @xmath592 .",
    "the rotational symmetry is then spontaneously broken by the nematic ordering at the isotropic - nematic transition , that also induces a spontaneous uniaxial in - plane distortion of the elastomer matrix , characterized by a strain tensor @xmath593 .",
    "expansion about this flat uniaxial state , ensuring underlying in - plane and embedding space rotational invariance leads to a nonlinear elastic hamiltonian of a nematic elastomer membrane .",
    "its form is that of the @xmath594 , eq.[hne0 ] , but with the harmonic strain @xmath595 replaced by a nonlinear strain tensor @xmath596 , that incorporates both in - plane and height nonlinearities of the form @xmath597 and @xmath598 , respectively .    in @xmath44 both phonon and height anharmonic terms are strongly relevant ( their perturbative corrections grow with length scale ) and therefore must be both taken into account .",
    "one approach is to generalize the above model to a @xmath42-dimensional nematic elastomer membrane and perform an rg calculation controlled by an @xmath85-expansion .",
    "however , it is easy to show that upper - critical dimensions for these nonlinearities are different , with height undulations becoming relevant below @xmath599 , and smectic - like and columnar - like in - plane nonlinearities with upper - critical dimensions of @xmath600 and @xmath601 , respectively .",
    "hence for @xmath602 , in - plane phonon nonlinearities can be neglected , with height undulation nonlinearities ( of the type studied in secs.[scsaflat],[tubuleanomalous ] the only remaining relevant ones for @xmath603 , and controllable close to @xmath604 with an @xmath104-expansion .",
    "generically , one would expect these undulation nonlinearities to renormalize bending rigidities @xmath605 as well as in - plane elastic moduli @xmath606 , leading to anomalous elasticity with @xmath607 , @xmath608 . as discussed in sec.[scsaflat ] , here too , rotational invariance imposes an exact ward identity between exponents : @xmath609 however , it is not difficult to show@xcite , that once in - plane nonlinearities are neglected ( legitimate for @xmath602 ) , the harmonic phonons can be integrated out exactly , and lead to a purely harmonic effective hamiltonian @xmath610 $ ] . therefore there is a strict _ non_renormalization of the bending rigidity tensor @xmath605 for @xmath602 .",
    "this together with the ward identity , eq.[wardnemembrane ] gives @xmath611 a result that is supported by a detailed renormalization group calculation.@xcite this analysis also makes contact and recovers some of the results previously obtained in the studies of isotropic polymerized membranes .",
    "in particular , the previously seemingly unphysical , the so - called `` connected fluid''@xcite is realized as a fixed point of a nematically - ordered elastomer membrane that is unstable to the globally stable nematic - elastomer fixed point.@xcite    despite of some success , there are obvious limitations of above description , most notably in its application to the physical case of @xmath44 elastomer membranes and inclusion of the ( usually more dominant ) local network heterogeneity .",
    "the first shortcoming primarily has to do with the neglect of in - plane elastic nonlinearities , which , near the gaussian fixed point become relevant for @xmath612 . while it is very likely that the subdominance of these in - plane nonlinearities relative to the undulation ones will persist some amount _ below _",
    "@xcite , we expect that in the physical case of @xmath44 all three nonlinearities need to be treated on equal footing . carrying this out in a consistent treatment",
    "remains an open and challenging problem .",
    "secondly , elastomers are only statistically homogeneous and isotropic , exhibiting significant local heterogeneity in the polymer network . as we saw in sec.[heterogeneity ] , such internal quenched disorder has rich qualitative effects in ordinary polymerized membranes .",
    "furthermore , recent work by xing and radzihovsky has demonstrated,@xcite that interplay between nonlinear elasticity and random strains and torques ( due to network heterogeneity ) leads to disorder controlled anomalous elasticity even in three - dimensional bulk nematic elastomers .",
    "because nematic elastomer membranes are far softer than ordinary polymerized membranes and their bulk analogs , we expect network heterogeneity to have strong and rich effects in these systems .",
    "considerable research remains to work out the resulting phenomenology .",
    "it is interesting to conclude with a general discussion of the global conformational phase behavior of nematic elastomer membranes . as with ordinary polymerized membranes , upon cooling",
    ", isotropic elastomer membranes should undergo a crumpling ( flattening ) transition from the crumpled to flat - isotropic phase .",
    "upon further cooling , an in - plane ( flat ) isotropic - to-(flat ) nematic transition can take place , leading to a flat membrane with a spontaneous in - plane nematic order . as for explicitly anisotropic membranes discussed in sec.[anisotropy ]",
    ", such nematically - ordered elastomer membranes should undergo further transition to a nematically - ordered tubule phase .",
    "because of the in - plane rotation symmetry that is _ spontaneously _ ( as opposed to explicitly ) broken , such nematic tubule will exhibit in - plane elasticity ( `` soft '' phonons ) that is qualitatively distinct from tubules discussed in sec.[tubuleanomalous ] , and will constitute a distinct phase of elastic membranes.@xcite one interesting scenario of phase progression is the nematic - flat to nematic - tubule to nematic - flat reentrant phase transitions , driven by competition between growth of nematic order ( anisotropy ) and suppression of membrane s out - of - plane undulations upon cooling , as schematically illustrated in fig.[nephasediagram ] .",
    "considerable research to elucidate the nature of the resulting fascinating phases and transitions remains.@xcite      in these notes , i have presented a small cross - section of the beauty and richness of fluctuating polymerized membranes . i have demonstrated the importance of the in - plane order in determining the long - scale conformations of these elastic sheets , by discussing in - plane anisotropy and local random heterogeneity and showed that these lead to a rich and highly nontrivial phenomenology .",
    "the material presented in these lectures is an outcome of research done with a number of wonderful colleagues .",
    "the physics of anisotropic membranes presented in section 1 is primarily based on extensive work done with john toner .",
    "the section 2 on heterogeneities in polymerized membranes is based on many years of fruitful collaboration with david nelson and pierre le doussal . and the final section is based on a collaboration with xiangjun xing , tom lubensky and ranjan mukhopadhyay .",
