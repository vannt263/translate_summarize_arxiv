    "this @xmath0sr result is quite consistent with a little enhancement of the incommensurate magnetic peaks induced by magnetic fields in the neutron scattering measurements in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath5 with @xmath14 by katano _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in addition , it is noted that @xmath69 is not zero in the zn - free sample with @xmath17 , implying that the incommensurate magnetic peaks observed from the elastic neutron scattering measurements in the zn - free sample with @xmath97  @xcite do not necessarily correspond to the magnetic order formed throughout the sample .",
    "these results support our speculation that the dynamical spin correlation or the dynamical stripe correlations tend to be pinned and stabilized around zn .",
    "next , we discuss the peculiar dependence of the magnetic transition on the zn concentration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] . in the zn - free or slightly zn - substituted samples ,",
    "the magnetic transition is rather broad , though @xmath61 is comparatively high . with increasing @xmath7 , on the contrary",
    ", @xmath61 decreases as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tn](b ) and the transition tends to be sharp .",
    "this means that the fluctuation of the magnetic transition is large in the zn - free or slightly zn - substituted samples . in the moderately zn - substituted samples , on the other hand , the fluctuation of the magnetic transition is comparatively small .",
    "it appears that zn operates to pin the dynamical spin correlation or the dynamical stripe correlations so as to suppress the fluctuation of the magnetic transition , as suggested from our transport measurements .",
    "@xcite the decrease of @xmath61 with increasing @xmath7 may be attributed to weakening of the spin correlation due to the spin - dilution effect of the nonmagnetic zn .    as for the increase in @xmath64 with increasing @xmath7 for @xmath98 ,",
    "a qualitatively similar behavior has been observed in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) antiferromagnetically ordered region ( @xmath99 ) of la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath3zn@xmath4o@xmath5 by hcker _",
    "et al_.  @xcite they have insisted that the localization of holes around the substituted zn restores the af correlation between cu spins , resulting in the increase in @xmath100 with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "this scenario may be substantially suitable but is a little different from the case of @xmath101 0.115 .",
    "considering that the dynamical stripe correlations of spins and holes exist at @xmath97 , it is likely that the dynamical stripe correlations are pinned and stabilized by zn , leading to both the localization of holes in the one - dimensional charge domain and the increase in @xmath64 .    finally , we argue the cu - spin state in the heavily zn - substituted samples with @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath73 decreases gradually with increasing @xmath7 for @xmath76 and the muon - spin precession is no longer observed at @xmath41 in each @xmath8 , meaning that the magnetic order is destabilized with increasing zn concentration for @xmath76 . at @xmath42 , almost no fast depolarization of muon spins",
    "is observed , indicating that even a spin - glass state is not realized but the spin correlation becomes weak through the introduction of a large amount of zn due to the spin - dilution effect of the nonmagnetic zn .",
    "@xcite furthermore , considering that the 3d af order survives through the introduction of zn up to @xmath102 in the zn - substituted la@xmath25cu@xmath3zn@xmath4o@xmath5 ,  @xcite the destruction of the magnetic order through only the @xmath103 % substitution of zn for @xmath97 may be attributed to the mobile holes released from the possible stripe order .",
    "in addition , it is worthwhile noting that , at @xmath104 in @xmath37 , @xmath69 is 100 % but superconductivity does not reappear . in the zn - free sample with @xmath37 , on the other hand , @xmath69 is 100 % and superconductivity takes place .",
    "simply thinking , the 7 % zn substitution causes scattering of holes so frequently that holes tend to be localized , resulting in the destruction of the superconductivity as in the case of conventional superconductors . from the resistivity measurements , however , the value of the resistivity in the normal state at 50 k for the 7 % zn - substituted sample with @xmath37 is only about six times as large as that for the zn - free sample with @xmath37 and as small as that for the zn - free sample with @xmath105 where superconductivity appears at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite therefore , this may suggest that the dynamical spin correlation or dynamical stripe correlations are essential to the appearance of the high-@xmath11 superconductivity .",
    "we have investigated effects of the nonmagnetic impurity zn on the cu - spin dynamics and superconductivity from the zf-@xmath0sr and magnetic - susceptibility measurements in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath3zn@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath28 , 0.115 and 0.13 changing @xmath7 finely up to 0.10 .",
    "the @xmath0sr measurements have revealed that , in each @xmath8 , a magnetic order of cu spins is observed at @xmath9 0.0075 , while it disappears and cu spins turn into a fast fluctuating state for @xmath10 0.03 .",
    "it has been found that all the @xmath0sr spectra can be represented by the three - component function with different frequencies of the cu - spin fluctuations . from the magnetic - susceptibility measurements , on the other hand , it has been found that the volume fraction of the superconducting state rapidly decreases through the slight doping of zn and that its @xmath7 dependence corresponds to the @xmath7 dependence of the volume fraction of the fast fluctuating region of cu spins estimated from the @xmath0sr results . from these results , it has been concluded that the non - superconducting region induced around zn corresponds to the region where the cu - spin fluctuations slow down . in other words , it has been concluded that both the slowly fluctuating region of cu spins and the magnetically ordered region compete with the superconductivity .",
    "our results have been interpreted in terms of the development of the `` swiss cheese '' model .",
    "that is , it is considered that zn pins the dynamical spin correlation or dynamical stripe correlations and hence destroys the superconductivity around itself .",

    "therefore , we have decided that @xmath46 becomes @xmath63 , defined as the mean value among @xmath46 where the magnetic order is formed at 2 k , in the magnetically ordered state for each @xmath8 and defined @xmath64 as the midpoint temperature in the change of @xmath46 .    in this calculation , we have assumed that all the cu spins in the @xmath50 region contribute to the formation of an incoherent magnetic order . in the case that all the cu spins in the @xmath50 region",
