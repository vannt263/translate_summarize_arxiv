    "heterostructures formed by ferromagnetic multilayers that are coupled antiferromagnetically via spacers have a wide range of possible applications , ranging from high - density storage technology to spintronic devices.@xcite cases with strong perpendicular anisotropy ( as encountered , for example , in [ co / pt]/ru or [ co / pt]/nio with ferromagnetic [ co / pt ] multilayers ) have been the objects of intensive studies , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically.@xcite due to the overall structure of these antiferromagnetically coupled multilayers , they are sometimes referred to as synthetic or artificial metamagnets . in phenomenological approaches ,",
    "these systems are commonly modeled by layered antiferromagnets where a ferromagnetic multilayer is described by a single variable , namely the total magnetization of the multilayer . for strong perpendicular anisotropy ,",
    "this naturally leads to the description via an ising metamagnet where layers with ferromagnetic in - layer interactions are coupled antiferromagnetically . ising bulk metamagnets",
    "have been the subject of many studies in the past and their properties are well understood by now.@xcite surprises show up , however , when studying ising metamagnets in thin film geometry . in systems with an even number of layers and a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the surfaces",
    ", the temperature - field phase diagram exhibits a new phase in addition to the two phases of the bulk system ( the low field antiferromagnetic and the high field paramagnetic phases ) : for intermediate field strengths , the surface layer , which is magnetized oppositely to the applied magnetic field in the ground state , aligns with the magnetic field .",
    "the phase transition between the antiferromagnetic phase and this intermediate phase is discontinuous and ends in a critical end point.@xcite    the characterization of the ferromagnetic multilayers by only their overall magnetization is reasonable at low temperatures where thermal fluctuations are irrelevant .",
    "however , at higher temperatures , thermal properties will change with the width of the ferromagnetic stacks .",
    "in this paper , we address how the extent of these stacks changes the properties of ising metamagnetic films .",
    "motivated by the desire to better model the experimental synthetic metamagnets with ferromagnetic multilayers , we numerically study the thermal properties of films composed of ferromagnetic stacks that are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "using large - scale numerical simulations , we determine the phase diagrams for systems with stacks of different sizes .",
    "a comparison of different cases reveals many common features as well as quantitative differences .",
    "in addition to this study of equilibrium properties , we also investigate relaxation processes .",
    "non - equilibrium processes in systems undergoing phase ordering , including domain growth and aging phenomena , have been the source of continuous interest in the last decades .",
    "the majority of studies were either restricted to simple ferromagnets,@xcite yielding a rather comprehensive understanding of these processes in this type of systems , or to more complex situations where glassy dynamics result from competition and frustration effects,@xcite such as in the case of spin glasses .",
    "however , similar processes also take place in other systems and the metamagnets discussed in this work provide an interesting example .",
    "a further motivation for studying relaxation processes in the layered antiferromagnets comes from an experimental study that observed aging phenomena in co / cr superstructures where the cr spacer layers provide an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the ferromagnetic co films.@xcite since co films have an in - layer anisotropy , the co / cr superstructures are not well described by the models discussed here .",
    "still , the observation of magnetic metastability and of slow dynamic relaxation in these superstructures is very intriguing and reveals a need to better understand ordering and relaxation processes in layered antiferromagnets . in the second part of this paper , we present first steps in the study of non - equilibrium processes encountered in our systems during a temperature quench . after preparing the system in a disordered state ,",
    "corresponding to high temperature , we bring it in contact with a heat bath at a temperature at which the equilibrium system is ordered .",
    "this temperature quench may be done in the presence or absence of an applied external magnetic field .",
    "besides analyzing thin films , we also consider the non - equilibrium surface properties of thick films in order to extract the value of the surface autocorrelation exponent .",

    "section iii is devoted to a comprehensive study of the equilibrium properties of metamagnetic ising films where ferromagnetic stacks are coupled antiferromagnetically .",

    "the recent emergence of artificial antiferromagnets in the form of superstructures in thin film geometry has resulted in a need to also better understand the properties of metamagnetic thin films . in a realistic description",
    "one should take into account the fact that artificial antiferromagnets are composed of ferromagnetic multilayers , with an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the multilayers provided by the spacer layers .    in this paper",
    ", we took into account the finite extent of these multilayers and used an ising model where ferromagnetic stacks composed by a certain number of layers are coupled through an antiferromagnetic inter - stack interaction . using large scale numerical simulations",
    ", we studied stacks of different sizes and investigated both their equilibrium and non - equilibrium properties .",
    "the equilibrium phase diagrams as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field have the same qualitative feature for any size of the stacks , albeit quantitative differences are observed . as already found for the standard ising metamagnet in thin film geometry,@xcite a third phase , called the intermediate phase ,",
    "is stabilized due to the finiteness of the film . in this phase , both surfaces ( and the stacks they belong to ) align with the magnetic field , whereas inside the film an antiferromagnetic ordering of the stacks still prevails .",
    "the transition between the low field antiferromagnetic phase and the intermediate phase is discontinuous , and the transition line ends in a critical end point .",
    "the second phase transition , from the intermediate phase to the paramagnetic phase stable at high fields , is of first order at low temperatures and of second order at high temperatures .",
    "the existence of a tricritical point is a feature that is common to the films and the bulk systems .",
    "the non - equilibrium relaxation is complicated by the competition between antiferromagnetic coupling and the magnetic field .",
    "whereas in most cases the system relaxes rapidly to the equilibrium state , in roughly 35% of the cases with low and intermediate field strengths the system ends up in a long - lived metastable state .",
    "the nature of the metastable state can be understood through the analysis of the time - dependent planar magnetization as well as through the inspection of typical spin configurations .",
    "starting from a disordered initial state , the surfaces order first . as the ordering progresses from the outside to the inside , competition between different spin configurations can take place in the middle of the sample yielding long - lived domain walls in the innermost layers .",
    "we note that for @xmath8 these domain walls are predominantly in the diagonal direction .",
    "this is an unexpected result , and a more in - depth investigation , especially at very low temperatures , will be needed to gain a better understanding of the mechanism behind this .    finally , we studied thick films in absence of a magnetic field in order to compute the surface autocorrelation function .",
    "we found that this quantity decays algebraically , with the surface autocorrelation exponent taking on a value that differs from that of its bulk counterpart . due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian for vanishing magnetic fields ,",
    "this exponent is the same as that for the three - dimensional ising model ."
