    "the interaction of a supermassive black hole in a galaxy center with dark matter halo is already much investigated @xcite .",
    "there an adiabatic invariant approach is applied for different halo structure .",
    "the initial halo profiles are taken to be self - similar ( power - law ) @xmath4 , isothermal ( @xmath5 ) and nfw profiles@xcite ( @xmath6 ) . in ref .",
    "the method of adiabatic invariant is used to calculate small changes in orbital parameters of particles caused by slow variation of gravitational potential due to the black hole growth .",
    "this approach has two drawbacks : absorption by bh is not taken into account , and appropriate change of dm distribution function is neglected .",
    "the latter means that the loss cone is always full , thus leading to overestimation of dark matter flow .",
    "more correct approach is used in refs .  .",
    "there the evolution of dm distribution function due to absorption by bh and changes in bh mass and loss cone parameters are considered consistently .",
    "the authors come to the conclusion that for current values of black hole masses the fraction of dark matter inside them is rather small .",
    "this approach was developed in ref .  , where the change of dark matter distribution function outside the loss cone due to diffusion in phase space was taken into account .",
    "it was demonstrated that this diffusion caused by gravitational scattering of dm particles on stars effectively refills the loss cone and determines the bh growth law .",
    "this effect was shown to give reasonable estimate for observed black holes masses .    the present work further develops the mentioned approach by accounting for three other factors : change of gravitational potential in the vicinity of black hole , modification of star distribution in this region , and the conditions under which the diffusion becomes effectively two - dimensional .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we introduce our model of dark matter halo and the galactic bulge . in the second section",
    "we write down the kinetic equation which describes the evolution of dark matter halo in phase - space , and calculate several quantities related to star distribution and dark matter motion .",
    "calculation of the diffusion coefficients is performed in the third section . also estimated",
    "are the diffusion timescales and corrections related to the central region . in the fourth section the solution of the diffusion equation in one - dimensional form",
    "is presented , the black hole growth law is established , and the corrections to the dm flow due to two - dimensional diffusion and the central region are investigated .",
    "it is shown that these corrections in most cases play no significant role in the diffusion process .",
    "finally , in the section 5 we present some numerical results and discuss them .      while the most part of matter in the universe is now proved to be dark",
    ", the nature of the dark matter still remains unclear . in most models ,",
    "however , the significant or dominant part of dark matter is taken to consist of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , i.e. non - relativistic particles interacting only gravitationally .",
    "this leads to the absence of thermodynamical equilibrium in dm gas and the necessity of kinetic approach . following this approach",
    "it was shown that the initial inhomogenities in dm distribution grow and form spherically - symmetric structures ",
    "non - dissipative gravitational singularities ( ngss ) of different scales , having the same internal structure .",
    "general analytic theory of ngs formation @xcite ( consistent with numerical simulations @xcite and other analytic theories @xcite ) predicts that all these structures have similar density profiles described by the following formula : @xmath7 the density profiles of dm haloes appearing in numerical simulations ( see refs .  ) have different forms , typically shallower in the centre . while being more realistic in the outer parts than the profile ( [ rho_init ] ) due to hierarchical formation mechanism , they can not describe well the very inner region because of limited spatial resolution , thereby allowing different values of the inner slope @xcite ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , all of which are within the errors in the simulations .",
    "furthermore , observations do not exclude cuspy density profiles @xcite , but still are unable to determine the inner slope precisely .",
    "therefore , the adopted profile does not contradict observations and is convenient for a number of reasons ( simplicity of distribution function and tight relation between angular momentum and energy ) .    as initial inhomogenities",
    "are not spherically symmetric , the particles of ngs possess angular momenta ( though total angular momentum of ngs is zero ) .",
    "high degree of contraction at the nonlinear stage makes these momenta relatively small compared to maximal possible angular momenta for corresponding orbital sizes .",
    "it turns out that angular momentum of a particle is related to its radial action @xmath2 by the formula : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the radial velocity , @xmath13 is the gravitational potential , @xmath14 are the turnpoints , and @xmath15 is a small parameter .    in this case , the distribution function of dm in canonical variables @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath16 has the following form : @xmath17 the average value of @xmath1 is zero , though the average @xmath18 is nonzero .",
    "the formation of ngs of galactic scale is followed by the formation of galaxy itself due to infall of baryonic matter into gravitational well of ngs , its subsequent cooling and formation of galactic structures  disc , bulge and halo . after this stage",
    "the total gravitational potential is no longer defined by dm ; conversely , in the central region it is mainly directed by baryons .",
    "galaxy formation process is slow enough as compared to the dynamical time of dm particles , so that the gravitational potential evolution is adiabatic .",
    "this fact ensures that radial action is integral of motion ( adiabatic invariant ) .",
    "it is defined by equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are minimal and maximal distances of a dm particle from center ; @xmath22 due to small angular momentum ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "our main task is to study the central region of a galaxy  the bulge , which we may consider to be spherically symmetric . under this assumption angular momentum",
    "is also conserved , and we obtain that the dm distribution function written in variables @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath16 does not depend on time . spatial distribution of dm is given by relation @xmath24 @xmath25 is the energy interval where the expression under the radical sign is non - negative .",
    "let us assume that the density and the potential of the bulge have power - law profiles : @xmath26 then one can show @xcite that the radial action may be approximated ( with the accuracy better than 8% ) in a factorised form @xmath27^{1/2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where function @xmath28 at small argument @xmath29 is linear : @xmath30    hence the dm density profile is also power - law : @xmath31    let us now overview the bulge structure and proceed to estimation of dm fraction in the bulge .",
    "bulge is the central part of a galaxy , for our galaxy its radius being about 1 kpc and mass about @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we assume it to be spherically symmetric .",
    "bulge density profile can be derived from the dependency of stars velocity dispersion on distance to galactic center ; we take it to be power - law : @xmath33 . for isothermal bulge , i.e. having uniform velocity dispersion , @xmath34 .",
    "milky way bulge may be approximated with velocity dispersion @xmath35 for @xmath36 @xcite , which corresponds @xmath37 .",
    "it should be noticed that currently available observations of distant galaxies usually do not have enough resolution to derive velocity dispersion on scales less than a hundred parsecs @xcite .",
    "we assume their bulges to be isothermal in central parts , but one can show that the exact form of density profile does not matter much ; only its integral characteristics affect the final result .",
    "generally , in the center of a galaxy a compact object is located , which is assumed to be a supermassive black hole ( for a recent review see ref .  ) . for our own galaxy",
    "it is now proved that the compact object sgr a * is a black hole with mass @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the innermost star cluster has the following density profile : @xmath39 hence the mass of this cluster is @xmath40 . for the sake of simplicity we have taken the masses of all stars to be equal @xmath41 .",
    "let us define the influence radius @xmath42 of bh by the condition that the total mass of stars inside this radius equals that of the bh : @xmath43    so we may assume that inside this radius the gravitational potential is dominated by bh , while outside it the influence of bh is negligible .",
    "notice that bh and bulge evolution changes values of @xmath44 and @xmath42 .",
    "if we assume that the star density is continuous at @xmath42 while @xmath42 increases due to bh growth , then the following relation between @xmath45 and @xmath42 arises : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the coefficient in the bulge density profile ; for isothermal bulge with velocity dispersion @xmath48 @xmath49 ( see ( [ n_iso ] ) ) .",
    "the total mass of milky way s dark matter halo can be assessed to be @xmath50 , its radius to be @xmath51 100 kpc @xcite . from ( [ i_fact ] )",
    "we derive adiabatic invariant for particles with @xmath52 to be @xmath53 . if we suppose that the initial distribution ( [ f_init ] ) can be extrapolated up to @xmath52 , then tha total halo mass is @xmath54 and hence @xmath55 then the value of @xmath56 for our galaxy is @xmath57 .    in this case",
    "the relative amount of dm inside the bulge is given by @xmath58 this means that for the model distribution ( [ f_init ] ) the mass of dark matter inside bulge is comparable to the baryonic mass .",
    "the same relation is valid in the innermost region ( bh domain of influence ) .",
    "however , the distribution ( [ f_init ] ) is applicable only in some vicinity of the galactic center , and hence the actual values of @xmath56 and @xmath59 can deviate from the assessments ( [ f_0 ] , [ ups ] ) .",
    "observations and modelling of mass distribution in the galaxy do not give tight restrictions on the amount of dm in the bulge .",
    "depending on the model , @xmath59 may comprise from @xmath60 to @xmath61 of the total mass inside the central 3 kpc region @xcite , but not the major fraction of the bulge mass .",
    "so , for the final calculations of the bh mass we should decrease the value of @xmath56 ( [ f_0 ] ) by a factor of 34 or more .",
    "our goal is to determine the possible fraction of dm in bh , and to derive the growth law of bh due to absorption of dm .",
    "firstly , one can prove that the direct capture of particles with momenta less than @xmath62 does not lead to significant growth of bh since their mass calculated from distribution ( [ f_init ] ) with current value of @xmath63 is several orders of magnitude less than @xmath45 @xcite .    the simplest process which changes the distribution function of dm is gravitational scattering of dm particles on stars identical to coulomb scattering in plasma .",
    "the dark matter distribution function satisfies the following equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the hamilton function for gravitational interaction , @xmath66 is the poisson bracket , @xmath67 is the collision term in landau form @xcite : @xmath68 b_{ij } \\,d^3 v ' \\;,\\\\ & & b_{ij } = \\frac{2\\pi g^2 { \\mu'}^2 \\mu^2 l_c}{|u| }     \\left(\\delta_{ij}- \\frac{u_i u_j}{u^2}\\right ) \\;.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here entities with primes refer to stars and other to dm particles ; masses are denoted as @xmath69 to avoid confusion with momentum .",

    "two - dimensional fokker - planck equation was written in coordinates @xmath78 and @xmath1 , and solved analytically with certain simplifications , introducing the notion of energy - dependent loss - cone .",
    "a fraction of stars with small angular momenta is eliminated during one dynamical time , and the diffusion along energy axis leads to capture of stars with critical ( minimal ) energy .",
    "we use radial action @xmath2 instead of energy , because diffusion along @xmath2 axis does not lead to capture ; therefore the absorption process looks more clear . also , our distribution function is time - dependent and the black hole mass changes in time .",
    "observations show that the distribution function ( df ) of stars may be considered as isotropic , i.e. not depending on momentum , even in the central region @xcite .",
    "for isotropic df the tensor @xmath79 takes the following form @xcite : @xmath80    from ( [ i_fact ] , [ c_mu ] ) it follows that adiabatic invariant may be represented as follows : @xmath81 note that in the case of coulomb ( @xmath82 ) and oscillator ( @xmath83 ) potential the constant @xmath84 , and in the case of isothermal potential ( or close to it ) @xmath85 .",
    "it is convenient to perform linear variable change : @xmath86 since it is linear , the expression ( [ rkl3 ] ) for tensor @xmath87 does not change .",
    "in addition , due to small value of parameter @xmath88 , the initial distribution function ( [ f_init ] ) has the same form in new variables : @xmath89    the initial distribution function does not depend on @xmath16 , hence the solution of kinetic equation ( [ kin_eq ] ) will not depend on @xmath16 neither .",
    "we rewrite the expression ( [ st3 ] ) for collision term as follows : @xmath90 where the diffusion coefficients ( [ rkl3 ] ) are the following @xcite : @xmath91 here the averaging over angle variables is defined as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the particle oscillation period , @xmath94 is its radial velocity .    before proceeding to the solution of the kinetic equation ( [ kin_eq ] , [ stf ] ) one should define the distribution function of stars .",
    "we assume that the density profile of stars in the bulge is power - law : @xmath95 , and the gravitational potential is also power - law @xmath96 . in this case",

    "note that @xmath127 does not depend on @xmath1 and weakly depends on @xmath135 , not depending on @xmath135 at all in isothermal case .",
    "for @xmath125 we have @xmath136 the integral diverges at lower limit , so we take the value ( [ chiminconf ] ) for @xmath131 . for the isothermal case ( @xmath34 )",
    "it is possible to obtain an asymptotic approximation of this integral at low @xmath131 . since @xmath137 , the integral approximately equals @xmath138 .",
    "a similar consideration for @xmath139 leads to an estimate of the integral as @xmath140 .",
    "the expression in brackets before the integral weakly depends on @xmath141 and equals @xmath142 for @xmath34 .",
    "then @xmath143    the last coefficient @xmath126 can be represented as @xmath144 , where @xmath145 at @xmath146 .",
    "so one can neglect the term with @xmath126 in ( [ stf ] ) at low @xmath29 .",
    "we restrict the calculation to the case when the density of stars @xmath147",
    ". then @xmath148 the integral weakly depends on @xmath131 at low @xmath131 and equals @xmath149 .",
    "finally , we have @xmath150 comparing ( [ r22c ] ) with expression ( [ r22b ] ) for bulge , we conclude that they coincide at @xmath151 ( i.e. at the boundary of central region of the black hole influence ) .",
    "this means that the expressions for two limiting cases are consistent with each other .",
    "@xmath152    here the integral approximately equals @xmath153 ; so with the aid of ( [ chimincoul ] ) we obtain @xmath154 similarly to the previous case we get that @xmath155 , so it can be neglected at low @xmath1 .",
    "one can easily see that for an equation @xmath156 the characteristic time of `` equillibrium establishment '' at spatial scale @xmath157 equals @xmath158 .",
    "let us make a few estimates for kinetic equation ( [ kin_eq ] ) with coefficients ( [ r22b ] , [ r11b ] ) calculated for the bulge .",
    "the diffusion timescale for momenta @xmath159  yr , so that the galactic age corresponds to spatial area of @xmath160  pc .",
    "the coefficient @xmath125 increases with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "the diffustion timescale along @xmath135 axis at minimal momentum @xmath161 equals @xmath162  yr , and for @xmath163  pc @xmath164 is much less that the galactic age .",
    "but for momenta at least an order of magnitude greater than @xmath63 the diffusion along @xmath135 axis does not disturb much the one - dimensional diffusion along @xmath1 .",
    "we will show in the next section that if we account for a cutoff of star distribution function at @xmath165 , then we obtain a finite limit for @xmath125 with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath164 becomes comparable with @xmath166 or greater for all @xmath167 100  pc .",
    "hence in the first approximation we can neglect the diffusion along @xmath135 in comparison with the diffusion along @xmath1 , at least for not very small values of @xmath1 .",
    "in addition we determine the characteristic timescale for diffusion in the central region .",
    "since @xmath168 the timescale does not depent on initial value of momentum and equals @xmath169 .",
    "indeed , in deriving relations ( [ f0conf ] , [ f0coul ] ) we have neglected the fact that number density of stars in the vicinity of black hole may be significantly less than that follows from general power - law profile due to stars capture or tidal disruption by black hole . from ( [ r11b_int ] )",
    "we see that it is the stars in the pericenter of the orbit that affect the coefficient @xmath125 most of all .",
    "hence for particles with low momenta these are the innermost stars , which number we may have overestimated .",
    "now let us try to evaluate corrections linked to this fact .",
    "firstly , consider the coulomb potential region .",
    "observations show @xcite that the nearest star s orbital axis approximately equals 1000 au @xmath170 pc . but",
    "from ( [ center ] ) we see that the number of stars inside a sphere of radius 1000 au should be about 15 .    for correction",
    "we adopt that stars distribution function vanishes for energies @xmath171 .",
    "thus the density profile ( [ center ] ) transforms to @xmath172 \\;.\\ ] ]    comparison with observations gives the value @xmath173 pc @xmath174 .",
    "now let us calculate modified coefficient @xmath125 .",
    "following ( [ r11c_int ] ) we obtain the expression ( with integration from 0 to 1 in this case ) : @xmath175 @xmath176 for @xmath177 pc , @xmath178 , we have @xmath179 , hence in the whole central region of coulomb potential the lower limit of integration @xmath125 is given by @xmath180 .",
    "this means that @xmath125 is in fact is much less ( approximately @xmath181 times ) than calculated from ( [ r11c ] ) .",
    "secondly , the same formalism in the region of self - consistent ( particularly , isothermal ) potential should include the statement that distribution function of stars vanishes for sufficiently low energies . for",
    "isothermal star distribution this corresponds to well - known solution for isothermal sphere with core ( i.e. no central cusp ) , and the core radius is of the same order that @xmath182 .",
    "unfortunately , we can make no estimation for core radius from observations , since their spatial resolution is not enough .",
    "we may adopt the same value as calculated for our galaxy ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "one can show that this assumption changes the lower limit of integration in ( [ r11b_int ] ) to value @xmath184 .",
    "thus @xmath125 increases with decreasing momentum up to @xmath185 and then reaches constant limit . at the same time",
    "@xmath127 is not affected by this cut since the integrand in ( [ r22b_int ] ) is small at small @xmath132 .",
    "it was shown in previous sections that coefficient @xmath127 does not depend on @xmath1 in the bulge outside the central region of bh influence ; coefficient @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 . since at the initial moment @xmath189 and our scope of interest lies in the domain of low momenta",
    ", we can take @xmath190 and disregard the term with @xmath126 . furthermore , from the same arguments it follows that @xmath191 at the initial moment , and since @xmath192 at @xmath193 , then @xmath194 at not very low values of @xmath1 . finally , @xmath195 at @xmath161 , hence @xmath196 , and @xmath197 is limited at @xmath198 .",
    "also notice that in fact @xmath125 itself is limited at @xmath198 , as noted previously .",
    "to summarize , in the first approximation we leave in ( [ stf ] ) only the first term and rewrite the kinetic equation ( [ kin_eq ] ) as follows :    @xmath199    @xmath200    initial conditions ( [ f_0 ] ) and diffusion coefficient @xmath201 @xmath202 is the boundary value separating the bh domain of influence and bulge itself ( as follows from ( [ r_0 ] , [ jcoul ] ) ) .",

    "firstly , we neglect that in central region of coulomb potential the coefficient @xmath244 differs from the expression ( [ r22b ] ) and take @xmath245 , @xmath246 . substituting the obtained value ( [ s_j ] ) of @xmath207 into the expression ( [ s_total ] ) for total flux , we rewrite it as follows : @xmath247 the absorption boundary @xmath63 changes with time . however , the flux weakly depends on the value @xmath63 .",
    "we approximate the logarithm in the denominator to have a constant value @xmath248 .",
    "@xmath249    supposing that black hole growth is governed only by the absorption of dark matter , we obtain the following growth law for bh mass ( assuming the mass of the seed black hole to be small ) : @xmath250    notice that more precise expression for @xmath207 at large @xmath228 reduces the value of @xmath251 approximately 1.2 times .",
    "thus the black hole growth is power - law with power index about @xmath252 .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous work @xcite , though the power index is a bit lower .",
    "one could suppose that the diffusion goes slower in the central region since the diffusion coefficient is lower there , and it may affect total growth law .",
    "in fact , nevertheless , it is not true . as has been shown in ",
    "[ tau_estim ] , the characteristic timescale for diffusion @xmath253 and is about @xmath254 yr .",
    "at the moment , hence it was even lower previously .",
    "additionally , from ( [ s_j ] ) one can see that maximum of the flux goes from inside the region @xmath255 , which at the moment corresponds to spatial area @xmath256  pc , and value of @xmath212 separating the central and outer parts of the bulge corresponds to @xmath257  pc .",
    "these two quantities depend on time in similar ways : @xmath258 , @xmath259 , so the relation @xmath260 was also true in the past .",
    "one can show that if @xmath261 varies in time , then we should take the following expression for @xmath207 : @xmath262 for each @xmath135 we define @xmath263 to be the time of maximal flux , and @xmath264 to be the time to enter the bh domain of influence : @xmath265 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath266 starts to decrease after the time @xmath229 .",
    "but one can easily see that @xmath267 , from which we conclude that this correction affects only the far `` tail '' of @xmath207 , when then most part of the flux is already absorbed , and is practically unimportant for growth law .",
    "now let s try to estimate the effect of diffusion along @xmath135 axis , i.e. the correctness of one - dimensional approximation .",
    "we restrict our consideration to the case @xmath34 when @xmath268 . having obtained approximate solution for one - dimensional diffusion equation .",
    "we substitute it into initial equation ( [ kin_eq ] ) and calculate the first term @xmath269 \\right\\}\\right).\\ ] ] of special interest is the time @xmath270 corresponding to the maximum of the flux : @xmath271 .",
    "it appears that @xmath272 : @xmath273 now we should compare @xmath274 with the second term in ( [ kin_eq ] ) @xmath275 .",
    "however , one can easily see that substituting ( [ f_aux ] ) into this term makes it zero , since this approximate solution does not satisfy initial equation in the whole region @xmath276 . to avoid this problem",
    ", we calculate the left - hand side of ( [ kin_eq_m ] ) @xmath277 : @xmath278 comparing with ( [ eta_j ] ) we obtain @xmath279 .    for @xmath280 ,",
    "@xmath161 this ratio is about 30 .",
    "however , it was shown at the end of  [ star_distrib ] that to estimate maximal value of @xmath125 one should take @xmath281 instead of @xmath161 , which lowers this ratio to about unity .",
    "it should be emphasized that all these estimations are rather approximate , since for precise assertions one should know the exact solution of one - dimensional diffusion .",
    "the arguments of  [ dif1d ] give only the correct value for flux through @xmath161 , but not the exact solution for all @xmath1 .",
    "in general case , the inapplicability of reduction to one - dimensional diffusion at @xmath282 does not change much the value of flux through @xmath161 , since the diffusion along @xmath135 axis leads to the `` blur '' of distribution function along this axis , while the coefficient @xmath127 only weakly depends on @xmath135 as follows from ( [ r11b ] ) .",
    "this is a benefit of selecting radial action as the second variable instead of energy as it was in previous works @xcite .",
    "however , an especial consideration is necessary whether this diffusion may lead to the drift of dark matter into the region of large @xmath135 where changes of @xmath283 during one period exceed their values , and diffusion approximation becomes incorrect .",
    "in conclusion , we make theoretical estimations of black hole masses obtained from growth law ( [ mbh_ot_t ] ) and compare them with observational data for several galaxies .",
    "as it was noted previously , in distant galaxies it is difficult to measure precisely the dependence of velocity dispersion on radius .",
    "however , in galaxies m  31 and ngc  4258 it seems to be almost constant and equals approximately 200 km / s @xcite . taking the value of @xmath56 the same as in our galaxy ( [ f_0 ] ) and the time of growth @xmath284  s @xmath285  yr .",
    "we obtain the value @xmath286 . the observed black hole masses are @xmath287 for m  31 and @xmath288 for ngc  4258 @xcite .",
    "the comparison shows that dark matter may comprise significant fraction of black hole masses in these galaxies .    as for milky way",
    ", the rotation curve is not flat in the center of the bulge , and the velocity dispersion may be approximately represented as @xmath289 , @xmath290  km / s @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the value @xmath37 . using the assessment ( [ f_0 ] ) for @xmath56 the expression ( [ mbh_ot_t ] ) gives the black hole mass @xmath291 , which clearly overestimates the adopted value of @xmath292 @xcite ( about a factor of three ) .",
    "notice that these values are about twice as smaller as in ref .",
    ", because of more precise estimate of dark matter flow ( [ s_final ] ) .",
    "if we take @xmath293  km / s , the numbers change only a little .",
    "the disagreement with observations may be explained by rather rough estimates of quantities @xmath56 and @xmath88 , which are determined by the whole dark matter halo and are different for different galaxies",
    ". if we take the value for dm fraction in bulge @xmath294 @xcite , then the resulting bh mass will be almost in agreement with observation .    in conclusion",
    ", we can say that the model discussed can give reasonable estimate for observed masses of giant black holes in galactic centers .",
    "it is likely that a large fraction of black hole mass may be comprised of dark matter .",
    "further development of this problem will require , firstly , more precise calculation of diffusion coefficients based on detailed data for star distribution in the central parts of the bulge ; secondly , taking into account the bulge evolution ; and finally , an exact consideration of two - dimensional diffusion accounting for particles fermi - heating and their drift out of bulge .",
