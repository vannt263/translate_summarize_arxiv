    "protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) are gaseous disks surrounding protostars .",
    "the gas in ppds are found to be rapidly accreting to the protostar with accretion rate of @xmath3 yr@xmath4 , with typical disk lifetime of about 1 - 10 myrs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite large number of observational programs aiming at revealing the structure , composition and evolution of ppds ( see @xcite and references therein ) , two crucial theoretical questions on the gas dynamics of ppds remain poorly understood : what is the level of turbulence in ppds ?",
    "how efficient is angular momentum transport in ppds ?",
    "the answer to these questions are essential to understanding the structure and evolution of the ppds , as well as a series of processes in planet formation .",
    "in particular , grain growth ( e.g. , @xcite ) , transport of solids ( e.g. , @xcite ) are both sensitive to the radial structure of ppds and level of turbulence .",
    "current models for planetesimal formation such as the streaming instability @xcite and gravitational instability @xcite generally favor weak turbulence and small radial pressure gradient .",
    "moreover , turbulent mixing and disk winds have a significant influence on the disk chemistry @xcite . when planets have formed , planet migration via planet - disk interaction also depends on the disk radial profile and diffusion processes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we are mainly interested in the t - tauri ( class ii ) phase of ppds when the envelope infall has ended and the entire disk is visible . at this stage the disk is in general not massive enough for gravitational instability to take place @xcite . in this paper , we focus on magnetic mechanisms .",
    "most regions of ppdsk ) due to direct illumination by the star that thermal ionization of alkali species na and k will provide sufficient ionization and the gas behave as ideal mhd @xcite , which is not the concern of this paper . ]",
    "are very weakly ionized @xcite , hence the gas dynamics is strongly affected by non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) effects due to the finite gas conductivity , which include ohmic resistivity , hall effect and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) .",
    "all three effects are relevant and important in ppds @xcite . generally speaking , ohmic resistivity dominates in dense regions with weak magnetic field ( e.g. , midplane in the inner region of ppds )",
    ", ad dominates in tenuous regions with strong magnetic field ( e.g. , disk surface and outer region of ppds ) , while the hall regime lies in between .",
    "it is widely believed that ppds are turbulent as a result of the magnetorotational instability ( mri , @xcite ) .",
    "the mri turbulence transports angular momentum radially within the disk that allows the majority of the materials to be accreted onto the protostar while a small fraction of mass disperses away .",
    "non - ideal mhd effects in ppds strongly modify the behavior of the mri .",
    "currently , most studies of the mri in ppds take into account only the effect of ohmic resistivity , and it is found that in the inner region of ppds ( about 0.5 - 5 au ) , the disk midplane is too weakly ionized for the mri to operate ( i.e. , the dead zone , @xcite ) , while the disk surface is still prone to the mri and should be turbulent ( i.e. , the active layer ) . a large number of numerical simulations have been conducted either in the local shearing - box framework or using full global approach to study and characterize the gas dynamics of the active layer and the dead zone , as well as exploring their physical consequences ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies show that the boundary between the active layer and the dead zone is characterized by the ohmic elsasser number @xmath5 ( see equation ( [ eq : elsasser ] ) )",
    ". moreover , the dead zone is not completely  dead \" in the sense that sound waves injected from the active layer bounce back and forth and give rise to some small reynolds stress .",
    "nevertheless , angular momentum transport is largely dominated by the mri turbulence in the active layer , and the strength of the turbulence ( considering ohmic resistivity only ) appears to be able to drive rapid accretion consistent with observations .",
    "comparatively , the effects of non - ideal mhd terms other than ohmic resistivity on the mri in ppds are less well understood .",
    "they are extensively studied in the linear regime without vertical stratification ( see @xcite for the hall effect , @xcite for the effect of ad , and @xcite for a general study ) , and with vertical stratification @xcite . in the non - linear regime , so far all numerical simulations ( all using the local shearing - box approach ) focus on individual non - ideal mhd effects such as mri with ohmic and hall terms @xcite and mri with ad @xcite .",
    "most of the simulations are vertically unstratified .",
    "these simulations provide useful criteria for the mri to be self - sustained in the non - linear regime and the results were applied in the framework developed by @xcite to estimate the efficiency of mri - driven angular momentum transport in ppds .",
    "it was shown that even in the most optimal scenario , the mri - driven accretion rate falls below typical observed rate by about an order of magnitude at the inner disk around 1 au .",
    "the main reason is that the strength of the mri turbulence is expected to be dramatically reduced in the conventional  active layer \" of the disk once ad is taken into account .",
    "similar conclusions were also drawn from @xcite , and from @xcite for different stellar masses .",
    "relatively large accretion rate can be achieved in the outer region of the disk under optimal magnetic field geometry , and with the assistance of tiny grains @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario for describing the gas dynamics in ppds is the picture of magnetocentrifugal wind @xcite : outflowing gas from accretion disks can be centrifugally accelerated along magnetic field lines when the inclination angle of the poloidal field is above @xmath6 ( relative to the disk normal ) .",
    "the magnetocentrifugal wind scenario has also been extensively explored with global simulations .",
    "early global simulations treat the disk as a boundary condition ( i.e. , razor - thin ) with axisymmetry , and prescribe the rate of outflow from the disk @xcite .",
    "these simulations demonstrated the robustness of the magnetocentrifugal acceleration and collimation , and further found that the flow structure is sensitive to the prescribed rate of mass loading from the disk , and may lead to episodic formation of jets @xcite .",
    "more recent simulations ( most of which are two - dimensional ) that do resolve the disk generally rely on artificially prescribed and excessively large diffusion ( that is unjustified ) to prevent rapid magnetic flux accumulation near the central object as mass accretes @xcite , and the resulting wind properties largely depend on the prescribed resistivity profile in the disk @xcite . in reality , the wind launching process is governed by the microphysics within the disk , with mass loading rate determined by requiring that the flow smoothly passes the slow magnetosonic point @xcite . it was found that launching a laminar disk wind generally requires a relatively strong vertical background magnetic field with around equipartition strength at disk midplane @xcite , though weaker field is possible in the presence of strong ambipolar diffusion @xcite",
    ". the vertical magnetic field can not be too strong , which would make it difficult to be bent by the disk material , and would result in substantial sub - keplerian rotation that hinders wind - launching @xcite .",
    "more detailed study of the wind - launching criteria and representative solutions were presented in @xcite and @xcite where all the non - ideal mhd effects were taken into account .",
    "it _ appears _ that the mri and the laminar wind scenarios tend to mutually exclude each other @xcite : mri operates when the vertical magnetic field strength is well below equipartition strength at the disk midplane , while launching an magnetocentrifugal wind requires the vertical field strength to be around equipartition .",
    "the strong magnetic field in the magnetocentrifugal wind scenario would drive very efficient accretion , making the disk much more tenuous ( with very small surface density ) than that in the mri scenario for a standard accretion disk @xcite .",
    "to briefly summarize , mri generally requires the background vertical field to be weak , and has difficulty in accounting for the rapid accretion rate in ppds , especially in the inner region of @xmath7au .",
    "the alternative picture of magnetocentrifugal wind generally requires the presence of strong background vertical field of equipartition strength that either drives accretion that is too rapid or results in a tenuous disk , but the microphysics of the wind launching process still requires more realistic treatment .",
    "we conduct vertically stratified shearing - box simulations of a local patch of a ppd that include a realistic profile of both ohmic resistivity and ad coefficients .",
    "the diffusion coefficients are interpolated from a pre - computed look - up table in real simulation time based on the gas density , temperature ( fixed ) and ionization rate ( calculated from the density profile ) .",
    "we have not included the hall effect ( which is numerically more challenging and demanding ) , and this is the first step towards understanding the non - ideal mhd of ppds beyond ohmic resistivity .",
    "this is the first time that ohmic resistivity and ad are simultaneously included in vertically stratified simulations to study the gas dynamics of ppds that incorporates the disk microphysics in the most realistic manner .",
    "all our simulations except one include a weak vertical magnetic field , which is likely to be more realistic for a local patch of a ppd .",
    "the other reason for including a vertical field is that such a field geometry is more favorable for the mri to operate in the presence of ad @xcite .",
    "we note that most vertically stratified shearing - box simulations to date adopt a zero net vertical magnetic flux field geometry ( e.g. , @xcite ) and we will show that such field geometry would make the strength of the mri turbulence diminishingly small due to ad . including net vertical magnetic flux in shearing - box simulations",
    "places strong demands on the robustness of numerical algorithms , especially in the magnetic dominated disk corona @xcite .",
    "recently such simulations are successfully performed by several groups , mostly in the ideal mhd regime , and it was shown that the inclusion of net vertical magnetic field always leads to an outflow from an mri - turbulent disk @xcite . in the context of ppds , it was found that including a net vertical magnetic flux does not change the basic picture of layered accretion ( again , considering ohmic resistivity only ) , but stronger net vertical flux leads to stronger mri turbulence in the active layer and reduces the vertical extent of the dead zone , as well as stronger outflow @xcite .",
    "although these results suggest the simultaneous existence of the mri and magnetocentrifugal wind , @xcite pointed that the outflow from mri active region is unlikely to be _ directly _ connected to a global magnetocentrifugal wind due to the mri dynamo and symmetry considerations .",
    "our simulations in this paper will further address the potential connection of the disk outflow to an magnetocentrifugal wind in the context of ppds , and we arrive at positive conclusions , in contrast with the ideal mhd case studied by @xcite .    more specifically , we consider a fiducial model that corresponds to a minimum - mass solar nebular at 1 au , assuming solar abundance of chemical composition and @xmath8 ( in mass ) of @xmath9 m sized grains for the chemistry calculation . we find that although the initial condition is unstable to the mri ( with net vertical magnetic field much weaker than equipartition )",
    ", the disk rapidly adjusts to a new laminar configuration that is stable to the mri .",
    "the new laminar state is characterized by an outflow launched by the magnetocentrifugal mechanism , and the outflow can achieve a physical wind geometry ( poloidal streamlines at the top and bottom sides of the disk bend towards the same radial direction ) by having a thin current layer where the horizontal field flips .",
    "the magnetocentrifugal wind launched in this scenario can efficiently transport angular momentum to account for the observed ppd accretion rate while without being too efficient to deplete the disk ( as in the conventional wind scenario ) .",
    "for clarity , we focus on the physical properties of the new laminar solution and together with a parameter study all at 1 au in this paper , extension of the results to other disk radii will be presented in a companion paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] , we describe the numerical method and the overall setup of our simulations .",
    "three contrasting simulations are presented in section [ sec : fiducial ] , highlighting the new laminar wind solution . in section [ sec : property ] , we study the physical properties of the new laminar wind solution in detail and discuss the wind launching mechanism . in section [ sec : parameter ] , we conduct a thorough parameter study to further explore the properties of the laminar wind .",
    "we discuss the robustness and implications of our wind solution in section [ sec : discussion ] , together with the conclusion .",
    "we use the athena mhd code @xcite to study the gas dynamics in ppds and perform three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "we consider a local patch of a ppd and adopt the conventional shearing - box approach @xcite .",
    "mhd equations are written in a cartesian coordinate system in the corotating frame at a fiducial radius with keplerian frequency @xmath10 : @xmath11 @xmath12\\ , \\label{eq : gasmotion}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the total stress tensor @xmath14 @xmath15 is the identity tensor , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the gas density , velocity and pressure respectively , @xmath19 is the magnetic field , @xmath20 are unit vectors pointing to the radial , azimuthal and vertical directions respectively , where @xmath21 is along the @xmath22 direction .",
    "note that the equations are written in units such that magnetic permeability is 1 .",
    "vertical gravity is included to account for density stratification .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used in the azimuthal direction , while the radial boundary conditions are shearing periodic as usual . shearing - box source terms ( coriolis force and tidal gravities ) have been readily implemented in athena @xcite , which uses an orbital advection scheme that splits the system into an advective part for the background shear flow @xmath23 , and a fluctuating part with velocity fluctuation @xmath24 : @xmath25 the advection scheme not only accelerates the calculation by permitting larger time steps , but also improves the accuracy by making the truncation error independent of radial location .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the isothermal sound speed . in reality",
    ", multiple radiative processes such irradiation and scattering are involved in ppds , making the disk surface layer substantially hotter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the hotter disk surface affects the properties disk wind , however , the main problems addressed in this paper are largely magnetic : the suppression / survival of the mri and wind launching are largely controlled by non - ideal mhd effects , where thermodynamics only plays a minor role .",
    "being weakly ionized , ppds are not perfectly conducting , which is reflected in the non - ideal mhd terms in the induction equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath28\\ , \\label{eq : induction}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the current density , @xmath30 denotes unit vector along @xmath19 , subscript  @xmath31 \" denotes the vector component that is perpendicular to @xmath19 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the ohmic , hall and the ambipolar diffusivities .",
    "note that @xmath17 represents the velocity for the bulk of the gas ( i.e. , neutrals ) , while tracer amount of charged species provides conductivity and gives rise to non - ideal mhd effects .",
    "the magnetic diffusivities depend on the number density of the charged species , and are characterized by the dimensionless elsasser numbers , defined as @xmath34 for ohmic , hall and ad respectively , where @xmath35 is the alfvn velocity . in the absence of grains , we have @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 being independent of @xmath39 ( see next subsection for details ) . generally speaking",
    ", self - sustained mri turbulence requires these elsasser numbers to be greater than 1 .",
    "ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) have been implemented in athena @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have implemented super time - stepping that substantially accelerates the calculation , which we have described in detail in @xcite .",
    "although our simulations do not include the hall term , we do evaluate @xmath40 and assess its importance in our analysis .",
    "we use natural unit in our simulations , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the initial density profile is taken to be gaussian @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the midplane gas density in code unit , and @xmath45 is the thermal scale height .",
    "we perform simulations with both zero and non - zero net - vertical magnetic flux . for simulations with zero net vertical flux ,",
    "the initial field is purely vertical given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the radial size of the simulation box , and @xmath48 parameterized by the midplane plasma @xmath49 . for simulations with net - vertical flux ,",
    "we add a uniform vertical field @xmath50 ( parameterized by midplane plasma @xmath51 ) on top of the sinusoidally varying component .",
    "physically , we consider a patch of the ppd using the minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn , @xcite ) disk model , with the surface density given by @xmath52 g @xmath53 , and temperature given by @xmath54k , where @xmath55 is the radius to the central star ( whose mass is fixed at @xmath56 ) measured in astronomical unit ( au ) .",
    "the mean molecular weight of the neutrals is taken to be @xmath57 from which the sound speed @xmath58 km s@xmath4 ( at 1 au ) hence other quantities can be easily evaluated . in particular , @xmath59 in our code unit corresponds to field strength of @xmath60 gauss .",
    "these physical scales are needed to normalize the magnetic diffusivities ( next subsection ) to code unit .",
    "we use outflow boundary condition in the vertical direction which copies the density , velocity and magnetic fields in the boundary cells to the ghost zones , with the density attenuated following the gaussian profile to account for vertical gravity . in the case of mass inflow ,",
    "the vertical velocity is set to zero at the ghost zones .",
    "a density floor of @xmath61 ( in code unit ) is applied to avoid numerical difficulties at magnetic dominated ( low plasma @xmath62 ) regions .",
    "we have checked that horizontally averaged densities in the saturated states of all our simulations are always well above the density floor is applied , which will be discussed in section [ ssec : adzn ] . ] . moreover ,",
    "the use of outflow boundary condition no longer conserves mass in the simulation box .",
    "we compensate for the mass loss so that a steady state can be achieved , following the same procedure as @xcite : the density of each cell is modified by the same proportion at the end of each time step so that the total mass in the simulation box remains the same . for most of our runs ,",
    "the mass change over the duration of our simulations ( if mass conservation were not enforced ) is only a tiny fraction of the total mass .",
    "the magnetic diffusivities are evaluated based on the chemistry calculation . instead of evolving the chemical network in real time , as done by a number of previous works @xcite , we assume equilibrium chemistry ( similar to @xcite ) , because the recombination time has been shown to be much shorter than the dynamical time scale @xcite .",
    "we adopt a complex chemical reaction network @xcite that is based on the umist database @xcite . in our fiducial model",
    "considered in this paper , we fix the elemental composition to be solar , with well - mixed @xmath9 m grains whose abundance is @xmath63 in mass ( about 0.01 solar , corresponding to substantial grain growth and settling ) .",
    "we follow the same procedure and methodology described section 3.4 in @xcite to evolve the network for @xmath64 years , with further details provided in sections 3.2 - 3.5 of @xcite . given the chemical composition , variable parameters of the network include gas density @xmath16 , gas temperature @xmath65 , and the ionization rate @xmath66 , which are scanned to give a complete coverage of the parameter space relevant to ppds .",
    "the outcome of the scan is a look - up table of magnetic diffusivities that is read into the code so that @xmath67 , @xmath40 and @xmath33 at each grid cell can be evaluated by interpolation in real simulation time .",
    "since we adopt an isothermal equation of state , @xmath65 is fixed , our look - up table is essentially two - dimensional ( @xmath16 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "the ionization rate in the disk depends on the column density to the disk surface .",
    "we calculate the horizontally averaged vertical density profile in real simulation time , from which a column density profile can be reconstructed , an approach similar to previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the sources of ionization include radioactive decay , cosmic ray and stellar x - ray ionizations , with prescriptions given in section 3.2 of @xcite , with fixed x - ray luminosity of @xmath68erg s@xmath4 and x - ray temperature of @xmath69kev .",
    "in addition , we consider the effect of far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) ionization . according to @xcite , fuv photons almost completely ionize tracer species such as c and s and give ionization fraction of the order @xmath70 with penetration depth @xmath71 g @xmath53 depending on the effectiveness of dust attenuation and self - shielding . and s@xmath72 into molecular ions which facilitates recombination ( @xcite , al glassgold , private communication ) .",
    "our treatment should be considered as a first approximation that captures basic physics rather than deep into the details . ] for simplicity , we assume an ionization fraction of @xmath73 in the form of carbon in the fuv layer , whose column density is chosen by default as @xmath74 g @xmath53 . within the fuv layer , the magnetic diffusivities expressed in the form of elsasser numbers under the mmsn disk model are found to be @xmath75 where @xmath76 is ratio of magnetic pressure to midplane gas pressure . a smooth transition ( across about 4 grid cells ) on the magnetic diffusivities from the fuv ionization layer at @xmath77 to the x - ray / cosmic - ray dominated ionization layer ( based on our chemistry calculations ) at @xmath78 is applied .",
    "as ohmic resistivity plays essentially no role in the low density region of the fuv layer , we simply do not reset ohmic resistivity in this layer .",
    "we calculate the magnetic diffusivities from the number density of all charged species at the end of the chemical evolution following section 2 and 3.5 of @xcite .",
    "note that the ohmic resistivity @xmath67 is independent of magnetic field strength @xmath39 , while hall and ambipolar diffusivities do depend on @xmath39 .",
    "in the grain - free case , we have @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . in this case",
    ", we can simply fit the proportional coefficients , @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively , and put them into the look - up table . in the presence of small grains ,",
    "a situation studied in detail in @xcite , @xmath40 ( @xmath33 ) is proportional to @xmath39 ( @xmath83 ) when @xmath39 is sufficiently weak or sufficiently strong respectively , while is roughly proportional to @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) at some intermediate field strength . in this case , we include in the look - up table the two proportional coefficients @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) at weak and strong field regimes from the fitting respectively , together with a transition field strength @xmath88 so that @xmath89 @xmath90 by comparing with figure 1 of @xcite , we see that the transition field strength @xmath88 corresponds to the situation that the ion gyro - frequency equals its collision frequency with the neutrals ( or the ion hall parameter equals one ) , which can be directly calculated given the gas density .",
    "being diffusive processes , large ohmic resistivity near the disk midplane and strong ad in the tenuous disk corona would significantly limit the code efficiency even super time - stepping is used to accelerate the calculation . in the ohmic regime ,",
    "the diffusive time step scales as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the minimum grid spacing . in practice , we add a cap to the ohmic resistivity so that in code unit @xmath93 .",
    "since the magnetic field strength near the disk midplane never reaches equipartition in all our simulations , the elsasser number at the disk midplane is always smaller than @xmath94 , well below the threshold value @xmath95 .",
    "also , this cap value of @xmath67 makes the diffusion time scale much smaller than the dynamical time scale , hence captures the basic effect of strong diffusion at disk midplane even if resistivity is much higher in reality .",
    "note that our resistivity cap is much larger than most previous works ( thanks to the use of super time - stepping ) , where the cap was of the order @xmath96 in natural unit ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the ad regime ,",
    "the time step scales as @xmath97 ( @xmath62 is the local ratio of gas to magnetic pressure ) . in the same spirit",
    ", we apply a floor to @xmath38 so that @xmath98 in every grid cell .",
    "this floor value of @xmath38 is again sufficiently small so that it does not make the otherwise stable field configuration unstable to the mri ( see figure 16 of @xcite ) , and it retains the effect of strong diffusion .",
    "in this section , we present three benchmark simulations with very similar initial setup but evolve into dramatically different states .",
    "all three simulations are three - dimensional ( 3d ) shearing - box with vertical stratifications , located at 1 au in a mmsn disk , adopting a chemistry model with well - mixed @xmath9 m grains with abundance of @xmath99 ( @xmath100 solar ) , and a fuv column density @xmath74 g @xmath53 .",
    "all simulations are run for about 150 orbits ( @xmath101 ) .    in the first simulation ( run o - b5 ) , only ohmic resistivity is included , which aims at modeling the conventional picture of layered accretion .",
    "we have also included a net vertical magnetic flux of @xmath102",
    ". a sinusoidally varying vertical field of @xmath103 is also added as initial condition to avoid the strong channel flows ( but has no effect on the saturated state of the system ) .",
    "the simulation box size is @xmath104 in the radial ( @xmath105 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath106 ) and vertical ( @xmath107 ) dimensions respectively , with a computational grid of @xmath108 cells .",
    "our simulations have relatively high resolution in @xmath105 and @xmath107 ( 24 cells per @xmath109 , or 34 cells if one defines the scale height to be @xmath110 , as in a number of works ) to properly resolve the mri turbulence @xcite , and have relatively large simulation box to capture the mesoscale structures of the mri turbulence @xcite .    in the second simulation ( run oa - nobz ) , both ohmic resistivity and ad are included , and we adopt a zero net vertical magnetic flux configuration with @xmath111 .",
    "again , the choice of @xmath112 has no effect on the saturated state of the system . after experimenting with several initial setups",
    ", we find that due to the extremely weak level of turbulence , the gas near the disk surface has very limited magnetic support hence drops very rapidly , and we must reduce the box height to @xmath113 ( and @xmath114 cells ) so that the gas density at vertical boundaries is not too small which would severely reduce the numerical time step .",
    "furthermore , we started the simulation with density floor @xmath115 , but then found that the density at vertical boundaries is always at the level of the density floor .",
    "we thereby keep reducing the density floor until @xmath116 when we no longer find artificial features near the vertical boundaries .    finally , we conduct a contrasting simulation from the above two cases ( run oa - b5 ) .",
    "the initial setup of the simulation is exactly the same as in the first simulation ( run o - b5 ) except that ad is included .",
    "figure [ fig : ini_els ] illustrates the _ initial _ profile of the ohmic , hall and ambipolar elsasser numbers for our runs o - b5 and oa - b5 ( similar but not exactly the same for run oa - nobz due to the different magnetic configuration ) . also shown is the initial profile of plasma @xmath62 . from the disk midplane to surface , the dominant non - ideal mhd effects are ohmic resistivity , hall effect and ad respectively for the initial field configuration , and mri unstable region is located at around @xmath117 where all elsasser numbers are greater than 1 and plasma @xmath62 is well above 1 .",
    "the initial fuv ionization front is located at about @xmath118 .",

    "we plot in figure [ fig : parameter ] the rate of mass outflow and the wind stress as a function of net vertical field strength .",
    "the vertical net magnetic field is a crucial ingredient to launch a magnetic outflow .",

    "this result is consistent with the ideal mhd shearing - box simulations by @xcite , as well as more recently by @xcite .",
    "although the wind launching is associated with vigorous mri turbulence in ideal mhd , the scaling of the mass loss rate with vertical background magnetic field is very similar .    on the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : parameter ] , we see that the rate of angular momentum transport , characterized by the wind stress , increases even more rapidly with background vertical field strength . a simple fit returns @xmath135 . since accretion rate @xmath136",
    ", increasing vertical net field reduces the ratio of @xmath137 .",
    "this is accompanied by the outward shift of the location of the alfvn point with increasing net vertical flux , and for @xmath138 , the alfvn point is beyond our simulation box .",
    "we also note for relatively large net vertical flux of @xmath138 , the wind - driven accretion rate ( equation [ eq : accrate ] ) would become too large compared with observations .",
    "therefore , a reasonable wind - driven scenario in ppds should involve only weak vertical background field with @xmath139 of the order @xmath140 to a few times @xmath141 .",
    "increasing the net vertical field also leads to rapid increase in the midplane magnetic field ( undead zone ) , which leads to larger @xmath142 . applying equation ( [ eq : accrate ] ) , we find the radial transport remains to play a minor role to the total accretion rate for all value of @xmath139 explored so far , but its contribution increases with increasing net flux .",
    "finally , we find that for relatively strong net vertical field with @xmath143 , it is less likely to obtain a laminar solution with the physical wind geometry : the strong current layer would escape from our simulation box and one recovers the undesired solution with odd-@xmath107 symmetry . this observation may suggest that maintaining the stability of the strong current layer becomes more difficult for larger field strength , although the issue can only be fully resolved by performing global simulations .",
    "the fuv ionization is another crucial ingredient of wind launching : the large ionization fraction in the fuv layer makes the gas and magnetic field be strongly coupled to each other so that it is essentially in the ideal mhd regime .",
    "the strong coupling between the gas and magnetic field is essential for effectively loading mass onto open magnetic field lines for magneto - centrifugal acceleration to take place .",
    "therefore , we expect the rate of mass outflow to strongly depend on the penetration depth of the fuv ionization . indeed , we see from figure [ fig : parameter ] that increasing @xmath144 by a factor of 10 results in a factor of more than 3 increase of the mass outflow rate .",
    "meanwhile , increasing @xmath144 also leads to a moderate increase of the wind stress , as seen on the right panel of figure [ fig : parameter ] . correspondingly , the ratio of @xmath137 increases with @xmath144 , in parallel with the lowering of the the alfvn point .      in the mri - driven accretion scenario studied in @xcite ,",
    "the predicted accretion rate sensitively depends on the size and abundance of grains . in the wind - driven accretion scenario",
    ", we find that the dependence on grains is much weaker .",
    "for the outflow rate , there is only a @xmath145 difference between the grain - free chemistry and the case with @xmath9 m grains with the abundance of @xmath146 .",
    "the wind stress , on the other hand , is almost independent of grain abundance .",
    "the weak dependence on the grain abundance is mainly due to the fact that the wind launching process mainly depends on the gas conductivity in the surface layer of the disk where grains only play a minor role : either the fuv ionization dominates ( which is independent of grain abundance ) , or the long recombination time in the low gas density leads to large ionization fraction that well exceeds the grain abundance ( hence grains have only very limited effect on the ionization level , see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the grain abundance does have a strong effect on the radial transport , as we see from table [ tab : windresults ] that @xmath142 increases relatively rapidly with decreasing grain abundance .",
    "nevertheless , the overall picture is unchanged since radial transport only plays a minor role in driving disk accretion .",
    "the surface density of the inner ppds is highly uncertain and have not been well constrained observationally ( situation is better for the outer disk with millimeter interferometric observations , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the mmsn surface density serves as an initial guess and is likely on the lower end , while much more massive inner disks are also speculated ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface density should decrease with time as the disks evolve .",
    "therefore , we further consider disk models that are three time ( with label  m3 \" ) and @xmath147 times ( with label  m03 \" ) the mass of the fiducial mmsn disk , while we have also varied the net vertical flux in code unit so that the physical magnetic fluxes are the same for all runs . because we have adopted midplane density @xmath44 as our natural unit whereas in reality @xmath148",
    ", hence some conversion is necessary . in table",
    "[ tab : windresults2 ] , we see that the wind fluxes @xmath149 in the two cases vary by a factor of about @xmath150 , and the fiducial case lies in between .",
    "this means that in physical unit , the stress is more or less independent of the disk surface density .",
    "the wind mass loss rate @xmath132 behaves similarly and is roughly independent of @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , the accretion and mass loss rate in ppds is largely determined by the poloidal magnetic flux distribution through the disk , regardless of disk mass .",
    "in this paper , we have performed three - dimensional shearing - box simulations to study the gas dynamics in the inner region of a ppd ( at 1 au ) .",
    "non - ideal mhd effects , namely the ohmic resistivity , hall effect and ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) are crucial in the weakly ionized gas as in ppds .",
    "they affect the coupling between the gas and magnetic field in different ways and dramatically change the mhd stability of the system .",
    "particularly , ohmic resistivity dominates in the midplane region while ad dominates in the disk surface layer , and the hall dominated regime lies in between . for the first time",
    ", we have included both ohmic resistivity and ad in vertically stratified simulations .",
    "the diffusion coefficients are obtained self - consistently by interpolating from a pre - computed look - up table ( as a function of density and ionization rate at fixed temperature ) based on equilibrium chemistry .",
    "we first showed that the conventional picture of layered accretion fails when ad is taken into account . without considering ad ( the conventional scenario ) ,",
    "the mri drives vigorous turbulence in the disk surface ( active ) layer that easily accounts for the observed accretion rates in ppds .",
    "however , we find that the mri activity is severely suppressed by ad , and the gas dynamics also sensitively depends on magnetic field geometry .",
    "more specifically , in the zero net vertical flux field configuration , the disk exhibits extremely weak turbulent activity , with total stress parameter @xmath152 , mostly contributed from a thin layer above the fuv ionization front .",
    "the resulting steady state accretion rate is about three orders of magnitude too small compared with observations .",
    "the main reason for such inefficiency is that mri in the ad dominated regime disfavors zero net vertical flux field geometry @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the presence of net vertical magnetic flux , the mri turbulent activity disappears and the flow is completely laminar . in the mean time , the disk launches a strong wind , which is accelerated to super - alfvnic velocities within our simulation domain . instead of mri driven accretion in the conventional scenario ,",
    "angular momentum is carried away by the magnetocentrifugal wind .",
    "we provide detailed analysis of the laminar wind solution .",
    "the wind launching process is mainly assisted by the vertical gradient of toroidal magnetic field , starting from about @xmath153 where gas and field lines are marginally coupled to each other ( near the midplane they are essentially decoupled ) . at the base of the wind ,",
    "the azimuthal gas velocity exceeds keplerian , and the magnetocentrifugal mechanism takes place and efficiently accelerates the wind flow .",
    "we find that the magnetocentrifugal wind very effectively carries away angular momentum from the disk .",
    "even with a small net vertical magnetic flux of @xmath102 , the launched wind is already sufficient to account for the observed accretion rate of about @xmath154 yr@xmath4 .",
    "the rate of the mass outflow @xmath132 is not a well characterized quantity in shearing - box simulations , which decreases with increasing vertical domain size .",
    "we speculate that realistic mass loss rate is much smaller than that measured in our simulations based on studying the dependence of @xmath132 on box height ; on the other hand , the wind stress , hence the wind - driven accretion rate increases only slightly with increasing box height , hence our measurement is more reliable .",
    "the natural symmetry of the wind solution obtained in our shearing - box simulations has an odd-@xmath107 symmetry which is inconsistent with a physical wind geometry .",
    "meanwhile , we find that the system has an equal probability to evolve into an exactly same solution but with horizontal velocity and magnetic field flipped at one side of the box .",
    "the flip takes place in a strong current layer with a thickness of @xmath155 that is offset from the disk midplane ( due to the large resistivity at midplane ) .",
    "this second solution has the desired physical geometry of the magnetocentrifugal wind , and in this solution , the entire accretion flow is carried within the strong current layer , with radial velocity achieving @xmath156 , while the rest of the disk remains static .",
    "we further show that a solution with enforced even-@xmath107 symmetry gives exactly the same magnetocentrifugal wind in the disk upper layer , which further verifies the robustness of wind - driven accretion scenario .",
    "we have performed a parameter study where we show that the rate of wind angular momentum transport @xmath149 increases rapidly with increasing net vertical flux , with approximately @xmath157 .",
    "similarly , @xmath158 .",
    "moreover , both the wind stress and the wind mass loss rate depend only on the physical vertical field strength and very weakly depends on the surface density of the disk .",
    "the fuv ionization which makes the gas in the wind zone behave as ideal mhd , is essential for wind mass loading .",
    "the depth of the fuv ionization , which depends on the extent of dust attenuation and self - shielding , also affects the efficiency of wind transport of angular momentum and wind mass loss relatively strongly . finally , we find that the grain abundance , which has been found to play a crucial role in determining the extent of the active layer in the conventional layered accretion scenario @xcite , has almost no influence on the wind scenario .",
    "this is mainly because that the wind launching process takes place in the upper layer of the disk where the chemistry is less affected by the grains ( since ionization fraction well exceeds grain abundance ) .",
    "the fact that the inner region of ppds is likely to be laminar with purely wind - driven accretion processing through a strong current layer offset from the disk midplane may have profound implications on many aspects of planet formation , particularly on the following two aspects .",
    "the laminar inner disk is likely to become the mostly favored spot for grain growth and settling , as well as planetesimal formation and growth . in the conventional picture of layered accretion ,",
    "the ohmic dead zone region is found to be not completely static , but has random motion due to the sound waves launched from the active layers @xcite .",
    "the level of the random motion , albeit much smaller than that in the conventional active layers , can still be large enough to prevent the solids from settling completely .",
    "the random gas velocities plays an important role on the collision velocity between dust grains that would impede grain growth @xcite .",
    "moreover , the stochastic gravitational torque from density fluctuations would excite the random velocities among existing planetesimals to sufficiently large velocities that their mutual collisions may lead to fragmentation rather than net growth @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite found that increasing the vertical net magnetic flux strongly increases the level of random gas motion as well as the strength of the density waves in the midplane hence greatly reduces the maximum grain size achievable from grain growth , and may lead to collisional destruction of planetesimals . in our laminar wind solution ,",
    "the disk midplane is essentially completely static .",
    "this provides the best environment for grain growth and settling , and is ideal for planetesimal formation and survival either via the streaming instability mechanism @xcite , or the gravitational instability mechanism @xcite , or via the vortices generated by the baroclinic instability @xcite or the rossby wave instability @xcite .",
    "the efficient wind - driven accretion through the inner disk would change our understanding about the global evolution of ppds .",
    "most current models on the long - term evolution of ppds adopt a phenomenological approach that treats the disk physics very roughly @xcite .",
    "in particular , under the framework of layered accretion in the inner disk , the presence of the dead zone often leads to inefficient accretion and pile - up of mass .",
    "the pile - up gradually leads to gravitational instability which eventually drains most of the inner disk material onto the star , starting a new cycle . in the mean time",
    ", zero net vertical flux global simulations by @xcite found that the inner edge of the dead zone is likely to become a local pressure maxima which serves to trap solids . in reality ,",
    "when more microphysics in the disk is taken into account , we see that as disk wind can be much more efficient in driving accretion at the location of the conventional dead zones , mass pile - up and building up a local pressure maxima may be avoided .",
    "what determines the surface density profile of the disk is the spatial distribution of the magnetic flux , rather than the grain abundance , etc .",
    "although our knowledge on the magnetic flux distribution in ppds is very limited @xcite , and it sensitively depends on the internal structure of the disk @xcite , attention should be drawn to re - consider the structure and evolution of the ppds focusing more on the transport of large - scale magnetic fields using global simulations .",
    "we have neglected the hall effect in our calculation , which also plays an important role on the gas dynamics in ppds . in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : fidoa - prof ] ,",
    "we also show the profile of the hall elsasser number for our laminar wind solution .",
    "we see that the hall effect at least dominates between @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( within @xmath161 , a floor is added to ohmic resistivity and ad , but not to the hall term since it is not included in the computation ) . at this location , we have @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and the azimuthal magnetic field dominates the vertical field .",
    "we note that for the hall mri , the stability depends on the sign of vertical magnetic field , while for ohmic resistivity and ad , stability is independent of the sign of @xmath164 .",
    "we expect the magnetic configuration in our laminar wind solution to be stable to the hall mri when @xmath164 is negative , in which case we expect the magnetic configuration to be adjusted to account for the hall effect .",
    "for positive @xmath164 , our laminar solution may become unstable to the hall mri according to the calculations by @xcite , but the unstable wavelength may well exceed @xmath109 due to the small value of plasma @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , as vertical stratification is not included in their calculation , it is uncertain whether the disk would eventually relax to another laminar configuration or lead to sustained mri turbulence , especially given the experience in this work that an initially mri unstable disk evolves into a laminar configuration in non - linear simulations .",
    "we have shown the the fuv ionization plays an important role in the wind launching process . in the mean time , the fuv photons are also important dirver of photoevaporation @xcite , which is not considered in this work .",
    "photoevaporation is considered as the main mechanism for disk dispersal and largely determines the lifetime of ppds @xcite .",
    "we expect photoevaporation and magnetocentrifugal mechanisms to boost each other and enhance the mass loss rate compared with pure photoevaporation models , yet more realistic thermodynamics with proper treatment of heating and cooling need to be included , and eventually to make predictions to compare with observations @xcite .",
    "the magneto - centrifugal wind is intrinsically a global phenomenon . as we have discussed before , uncertainties remains in our local shearing - box simulations regarding problems with the stability of the strong current layer , the mass loss rate , and the rate of wind - driven angular momentum transport .",
    "moreover , we have only studied the gas dynamics for a mmsn disk at 1 au , it is yet to conduct the same study at other disk locations to study how the wind properties depend on the radius .",
    "this will be presented in a companion paper , where we will show that the laminar wind scenario is likely to extend to about 10 au , while the mri ( in the presence of net vertical magnetic flux ) is likely to be the dominant mechanism for angular momentum transport at the outer disk @xcite . meanwhile , another interesting problem arises on how the transition occurs from a pure laminar wind - driven accretion region to a turbulent mri - driven accretion region .",
    "global simulations are essential to resolve the problems and uncertainties mentioned above , and are the ultimate way towards fully understanding the accretion processes in ppds .",
